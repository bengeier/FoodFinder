{"text":"Our seafood was fresh and beautifully prepared, and our waiter was pleasant and professional.  So why only three stars? Upon arrival we were \"greeted\" by a pretty enough but sullen young woman who seemed put out that we were there.  She picked up a couple of menus and just started walking...no \"right this way\" or anything else.  It was just kind of an unwelcome feeling. The room feels a little tight, so i would next time request a booth for a little more intimacy. But the food really was good seafood and well prepared.  I would definitely go back, even knowing that i might be an inconvenience to the leggy brunette hostess."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Chart House during AZ Restaurant Week.  The atmosphere is obviously incredible with the view of the lake, golf course with tall palm trees, and Camelback Mountain.  We really enjoyed the spinach and artichoke dip for an appetizer (but not the beef carpaccio as much).  We also felt the black and blue salmon was excellent!  The coconut crunchy shrimp was very good, but not too much different from other coconut shrimp we've had.  The mud pie dessert was also very good!  Our server was very good, but there was a point in time where our drinks were empty for a few minutes....not much time, but still, I always feel like a drink should never sit empty for any amount of time.  My water also didn't get filled until right before we were about to leave.  But overall, we still very much enjoyed our meal and our server was very friendly and mostly attentive.  We plan to definitely come back to try their happy hour as the bar area looked very nice and inviting."}
{"text":"As many others have said, pretty substandard service.  Food was bland all around. They do target the retired crowd who probably aren't used to things like flavor and spice.   Your grandma from the midwest is in town? The one who says \"oh dear these bell peppers are too spicy\" - take her to Chart House.    Otherwise, there are many sophisticated kitchens with better service to be had. The chocolate cake appeared to be store-bought chocolate ice cream in the shape of a cake. That doesn't cut it in Scottsdale's culinary scene.  We generally had to wait almost an hour between courses.  I can excuse that for the entree course (which came to me at room temp), but we ordered the restaurant week menu.  Appetizers were cold dishes and likely pre-plated.  Why did it take an hour to get them out of the fridge?  The dining room wasn't exactly slammed.  The manager did notice that our table had stacks of dishes languishing on it, and grabbed a cook to help him clear it, so kudos there.    Waiter brought a large glass bottle of water and poured it for our table, when it ran out he was right back to start pouring another bottle.  Many modern restaurants commonly leave a glass carafe of water at your table these days - only Chart House charges you $7 per carafe.  At the end of the night we had at least $21 in charges for water just on me and my wife's tab.  Well, the slow service had us there for 3.5 hours, we did drink a lot of water.  It wasn't made clear to us that this was \"fancy water\", which we would of course have turned down for tap water.  We chose not to argue the point.  We had to work the next day and we no idea how long it would take to resolve. We decided to pay the $21 penalty to be able to leave quickly.  Things they did wrong -  Slow service. Bland food / lazy menu. Snuck in for-fee water. Happy hour only in the bar. Entree not hot. Poor value for the cost - meal for two was around $140, one can find better food and service at restaurants 1/2 the price. And we had the restaurant week menu, which should have been their \"best first impression\" offered at a discount.   Not getting one star because there were a few places they excelled.   Things they did right -  Cocktails inspired and unique.   Creme brulee was excellent, well-rounded and complex.   Restroom was clean. Great views of the lake. Kitchen ran out of \"restaurant week\" sized dessert, brought us a full size dessert.  They have ducks outside and free bread inside.  If you get too bored between courses, you could always take advantage of those facts to pass the time."}
{"text":"Will never return to this place.  I'm reviewing a visit that took place a year to year and a half ago.  Forgive me for my tardiness!  One word about this place:  SLUG.  The dinner was fine.  The dessert was fine.  When they took the dessert dishes away, including the leaf garnish, there was something black on the table cloth.  And it MOVED.  It was some kind of SLUG!!!!  it was on the dessert!  Probably on the leaf.  We alerted an employee.  The manager (I think) came over.  We did not get any compensation for how disgusted my friends and I felt.  I think I threw up in my mouth a little just now reliving this horrifying experience.  They should've at least covered the dessert.  Actually, covering the entire meal may not have been enough either.  What if one of us ATE the slug?  GROSS!!!"}
{"text":"*H*O*R*R*I*B*L*E* BAR SERVICE -- 10/4 - was there with my sisters to watch the fish and have drinks. We had one round of drinks and then were completely ignored. The other customers around us were getting drinks. We couldn't catch the waitress' eye -- she would NOT EVEN LOOK OUR WAY! Finally, I waved both arms, but she walked past us until my other sister, yelled \"HEY!\". Waitress said she thought we had already cashed out. Hoo Boy! She needs more customer service training. We ordered, but a different person served us. We wondered if it was because we're Asian, that she couldn't serve us. We won't go there again. We were blatantly ignored. We spent $50 on drinks and left a 20% tip with \"Service Sucked\" on the receipt. Hope Chart House trains their wait staff to be more gracious and attentive."}
{"text":"We had a lovely evening here. The service was good and the food was excellent. I had the macadamia crusted mahi and loved it. My husband commented that the salad bar was very good and enjoyed his prime rib. They have a great wine selection. Beautiful view, also!"}
{"text":"Beautiful Place with amazing food and drinks! Great for for date or just break from craziness!"}
{"text":"We have come here quite often. Happy hour, dinner, restaurant week. Decided to try prime rib 1961 special. Waiter was never around. But when he was, he was panting and sweaty.  He didn't check on us to see if we needed anything ( my husband wanted more horseradish), we didn't get dinner until an hour after we sat down and ordered. Sure hope it goes back to what we experienced in the past. We will give it another try. But after that, if no improvement, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Really nice meal. Great setting and very good service. A little pricey but worth it. Enjoyed the presentation as well. Had the special shrimp and scallops and it was great. All the seating has a nice view."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with the food and service at Chart House.  As frequent dinners at Mastro's Ocean Club, the bar was quite high.  The view was rather scenic while overlooking a lake and accompanied with a sunset of Camelback Mountains. It was a great venue to hold my granddaughters graduation dinner.  Our Server Kim was attentive, friendly and aided to the experience.  I had ordered Prime Rib, which came with garlic mash potatoes. It was slightly over cooked but the garlic mash potatoes were delicious.  For desert we had ordered a few deserts but the Hot Chocolate Lava cake is a chocolate lovers dream with the Cherry Apple Crisp next. I enjoyed spending this special occasion with my husband, children and grandchildren and will be back!"}
{"text":"Would have given this a 4star but the staff didn't seem genuinely up to the task. The hostess snooty and not very welcoming. The Food was slightly above average. For lunch we started with the hummus trio, which is enough for 4, then the lobster bisque and it was very good, next the roasted beet salad and it was amazing the Caesar salad was average, nothing special, and we spit the sea bass and that was very good. Atmosphere very good, waiter good, I'd go back maybe try dinner."}
{"text":"We've been to the Chart House three or four times.  We have always received great food and service, and a nice view.  A hidden gem.  We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place!  I had the scallops with wasabi sauce, it was fantastic! The Scallops were well cooked, and the mashed potatoes ensure that you have enough food and won't go home hungry. As an added bonus, the green beans are well seasoned and taste more like a treat than a boring vegetable.  We ordered the oysters for appetizers. The oysters themselves were good, but the shell still had salt water in it. Fresh is good. Salt water is not good. It was a little disappointing and damaged the taste of the oysters. But, again, you can taste the quality.  The service was great, they checked in with us regularly, kept our drinks full, and made sure there was always fresh bread and butter on the table.  A solid 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great dinner and Chart House did a wonderful job of making my husbands birthday special.  Personalized menu, candles and mud pie!  I had Mahi with peanut sauce & mango salsa was delicious! Salad bar and Lava cake amazing!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with a view of the lake. The staff is very professional. I really enjoyed my salmon. I would come again."}
{"text":"I typically dine at The Chart House for special occasions and every time is a wonderful, memorable experience. One experience in particular was to celebrate my good friend's birthday.  We had the Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi-Mahi, Coconut Shrimp, Crab Cakes, and lots of great wine- ALL I would order again and try some new items on top of that. The atmosphere is relaxing and romantic. Our servers were Ronnie and Kevin; they were hospitable, timely, and come highly recommended. Thank you guys for an unforgettable evening!"}
{"text":"Eh, wouldn't go back.  Salad was pretty good but that's about it.  Ordered King Crab at a market price of $60 and half of it was inedible.  So dry and flavorless.  Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I did receive a call from a Johnny Barnett of ChartHouse who was very apologetic but ... I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Five-star service.  Shout out to Jeanette.  We were seated across from the amazing floor-to-ceiling aquarium per request at the time I made reservations.  That was pleasant.  Jeanette seemed to have a firm grasp of the menu and specials.  I picked a wine but sent it back before it was opened. And this is a peeve of mine and it just doesn't happen here:  Order a modest-medium price bottle of wine, say 50-$70, and it comes with a metal screw-cap.  Could probably pick it up from Trader Joe's for about $7.  Was offered other suggestions, more than I wanted to spend.  Ordered a couple of glasses from a label I knew and trusted.  Our menu was personalized to recognize our anniversary.    I had the Roasted Beet Salad which may be one of the best salads I ever had.  Arugula, roasted beets (tastier than I expected) pickled onions, candied pecans, blue cheese, all perfectly dressed in a vinaigrette.  My wife had the Ceasar.  She is a Ceasar connoisseur (she makes a damned good one, herself).  She didn't complain or compliment, only to say it was a decent sized salad.  They both were.   Fresh sourdough rolls were served right out of the oven and we had to fight the urge not to ask for more.  The entrees came out a shade too early, but that sure beats coming out late.  I had the Seafood Specialty plate:  coconut shrimp, calamari, fish, and lobster tail -- all fried. The calamari was good, cooked right with a decent breading.  The shrimp was way overcooked.   The type of fish was unknown, but it was almost inedible because of the greasy batter.  The lobster (which I suspect was a prawn) should probably never be prepared in this fashion to begin with.  Texture ok, but no flavor.  I fault myself for ordering a fried dish.  Even still, it certainly could have been better.  My wife had the Shrimp and Scallop dish.  Served with spinach gnocchi and corn in a heavy sauce.  The seafood was cooked well.  The rest of the dish seemed overly heavy and rich with little to offer the palate.    We had ordered the Gran Marnier souffle early on and it came out right on time looking gorgeous. Turned heads on its way to the table.  Served with little pitchers of raspberry and chocolate sauces.   It might have benefitted with a few more minutes in the oven, but it was very tasty.  No hint of Gran Marnier, however.    We agree that we probably should have just stuck with the salads and maybe an appetizer (or another Roasted Beet Salad!!).  We've had much better seafood dishes which cost less.  We did not expect this from a restaurant associated with the largest seafood restaurant chain in the free world."}
{"text":"We dined at the Chart House on 6/16/16 and had a wonderful time. Our waiter, Harris, made our experience truly exceptional. His recommended menu items were all perfect from the  Ssamjang Shrimp appetizer through our entrees: Mac Nut Mahi for me and Cuban Spiced Scallops & Shrimp for Patrick. The Chart House Souffle we had for dessert was a first for us and was also excellent.   The dining room atmosphere was a welcome grotto of calm in the craziness that is a LV Casino floor which went unseen and unheard just around the corner.  This was the second time we've eaten at the Chart House and I can't say enough about the amazing service Harris provided. He even went above and beyond in consulting with his coworkers to provide us with recommendations for the best night clubs to visit on our final evening in town.  Note: I'm marking the Ambience as \"Upscale\" and \"Classy\" but as with just about anywhere in Las Vegas, customers can dress casually without feeling out of place."}
{"text":"For the apparent caliber of this restaurant this was one of the worst meals I've ever had. Starting with my martini, through appetizer and entree, everything was just not very good. My wife had the same experience. In addition, both our entrees had to go back: they screwed up allergy issues for my wife's and the crabmeat atop my swordfish was cold. When entrees returned they were pretty tasteless. We were not charged for my entree and dessert, but the manager's apologies were lackluster. The ambiance is nice but for the cost of the restaurant we were extremely disappointed in the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Our waiter was great but I'm sorry but I don't like hearing the manager yell at his employees right near our table. The food is sub par. I could have a better salad at super salad."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was a bit disappointed with the initial service. When we approached the hostess stand we were met but a hostess who mumbled something and quickly walked away and never returned. About 5 minutes later a waiter showed up and seemed surprised several groups were waited to be seated. To his credit he handled it, got us seated and gave us good service throughout. The giant fish tank as usual was a highlight and the food was good. I would recommend the bisque and the roasted beet salad."}
{"text":"As a first-time guest at the Golden Nugget, I was impressed with the hotel. And Chart House definitely helped with that sentiment. The ambiance was great, loved the lighting coming from the aquarium. We have a Chart House in Honolulu, but the ambiance is nothing like this.  Our appetizers were good. I really loved our East Meets West, sliced seared ahi and ahi tartare with plantain chips with some sort of slaw. The bruschetta sliders were good, but not super memorable. However, the crab cake in my entree (the Mixed Seafood Platter, I believe...?) was one of the best. Like, actual chunks of crab and lighter on the bread crumbs.   And when your server encourages you to order dessert at the same time as the rest of the meal, you do it. They say that the dessert takes a bit of time to make. Our molten cake (with Heath crumbles!) came out and we. Mopped. It. Up.  Overall, this was a great place and really adds to the Golden Nugget experience. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Waited forever for service. Wasn't disappointed with the food though. The staff just needs to be provided with help during the busy times"}
{"text":"Great specialty drinks. We also had the hummus trio and it was very good, with the plantains and free refills. The drinks were amazing and different and of course the aquarium is spectacular. Would definitely come here again!!!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to have dinner in Las Vegas.  The food is wonderful and the fish tanks are spectacular.  We'd highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch celebrating my sons high school graduation.  Staff and food were amazing"}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere and Edward absolutely made my night by going all the way to another restaurant to get me marinara sauce for my calamari which made the meal perfect!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. ..maybe I was expecting great? Had Chilean sea bass...needed to be cooked just a tiny bit more. The lobster had a couple bits of shell. The lobster bisque was tasty. BF had roasted beet salad that was very tasty but the beets weren't really roasted. BF also had the baked stuff shrimp...just okay. Nothing exciting. ..bland. Our server was awesome though. Second chance and both times just okay. Won't be back at these prices."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, very friendly stuff, close to free parking. But i came here to eat, not to watch pretty fishes... and food was just OK"}
{"text":"This is a gorgeous restaurant! I love that you can actually sit right next to the aquarium as you dine. As far as service goes, it's prompt, courteous, and professional.   The food takes a little while to come out of the kitchen,  but they are using fresh ingredients and cooking everything to order. I wouldn't expect a quick lunch or dinner here, this is more for leisure than for dining and dashing.   The food was cooked to perfection. You can rely on having a romantic date or relaxed business meal here.  If you want to check out the place, but you don't want to spend your baby's Gerber life plan money away,  just pop in at lunch time or during happy hour."}
{"text":"We made reservations to Chart House on my birthday since we were going to be downtown for the St. Patrick's day festivities and I had a pretty decent group with me. Having dinner in front of the fish tank was awesome but made me wonder if the fish I was eating was the lucky one to get plucked outta the tank.   I was surprised that they had made a personalized menu for my table. Apparently they ask if anyone is celebrating a special occasion when you call to make reservations. I thought this was pretty cool. Plus they let me keep the personalized menus. A very nice gesture.  Ok on to the food, the sea bass with saffron risotto was tasty. I think I enjoyed that better than my dish. I had the stuffed flounder, which was good but the flounder had no flavor and a little dry until you mixed it with the crab. The sea bass though, mmm. I also heard that the jumbo stuffed shrimp, surf & turf, and fish & chips were very enjoyable.   Overall the experience was awesome especially since it was in downtown. Our waiter Eddie was funny, very helpful and willing to split our checks. Towards the end of our dining experience, they brought out their Hot Chocolate Lava Cake and Eddie initiated the Happy Birthday song. Kudos to this guy! I heart Downtown Vegas and find it appealing when you find these hidden gems in that area."}
{"text":"Me and my lady are in Vegas for her 31st birthday, and stumbled across this unbelievable restaurant. Our waitress Beth was amazing. She has Midwest roots, and it all came out when we met. I'm here til Monday morning, I'll see you guys soon. Thanks."}
{"text":"The Entree that we (group of 4) had was very good, but the Hot Chocolate Lava Cake was not what it was hyped up to be and what I thought was included with my meal was an extra charge. If you want a dessert latte go to McDonalds."}
{"text":"As Chart House locations go, this one is hit & miss.  I've definitely had much better luck at the West coast spots such as Malibu, Redondo Beach and Lake Tahoe (on the Nevada side).  Anyway, the Prime Rib is usually outstanding at any Chart house, along with the bread, salads & desserts -- I'm going with two stars for the Scottsdale restaurant because of the service not being what it should compared to the others.  You usually can't go wrong for nice night out if you pick Chart House but in my experience, it seems the Scottsdale one can be 'hot or cold'."}
{"text":"This was so bad!  Here's what's wrong quickly since there seems to be no shortage of bad reviews for this place. 1. Service was exceptionally slow. 2. Poorly trained servers.  3. Waited 5 minutes for water, 25 minutes for appetizer. 4. another 30 minutes for entrees. 5. Half the food was luke warm the other half had been microwaved or heat lamped or something since it was dried out. 6. Lobster portion was skimpy. 7. This place has premium prices, even though a chain, has been in business for many years and they are being run by a bunch of accountants. Other chains like Ruth Chris, etc do a pretty good job; this place is awful and has no clue.  I complained to mgr., since waitress was hopeless....comped meal and don't even care! I would have refused to pay for entrees. And I have never done that in 40 years of dining out. Never. Oh...last nice touch...1st 2 items we ordered they were out of...Mother's day, sea bass and scallops, out?   How hard is it to plan since you know you have a full house but accountants are in charge of ordering so they just say \"let them order somethng else.\" They'll stay in business though...nice location, preying on unsuspecting tourists....sad. If you go you derve what you get!"}
{"text":"I gave this place two stars for the view and our server was really nice.  I really wanted to like this place despite the bad yelp reviews because the atmosphere and views are so pretty and I've been to the Chart House in California and it was really good. All of our food came out tasting burnt and they had gotten my food wrong and forgotten things.  I wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"Terrible service, mediocre food!  Our waiter was a jerk!  The place was not busy.  Waiter left us without drinks for 15 minutes or more.  Entrees took over an hour to get to our table which would have been OK had the waiter kept us updated and bothered to show his face at our table (but he couldn't be bothered).  He walked by many times to serve everyone around us, but ignored our table.  Someone from our table had to go hunt the waiter down 3 times to get service.  I guess the waiters at this place are allowed to discriminate!    When the food arrived it was not worth the wait.  I didn't even finish it.  The harried-looking manager offered us a free dessert, but we were so mad at the bad service we got our check and left. WILL NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, would give it a 5 if the fish didn't taste bland and my girl friends steak had way to much fat on the prime rib."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. Let me start by saying the staff and the service was fantastic! No problems there. On the night we went it was around 7:30pm and the place was mostly empty. They had everyone who was there seated at tables right next to each other all in the same room.   I guess they wanted everyone to have a scenic window seat but it made for a very crammed and loud dinner experience. It was our fault that we didn't ask to be moved.  The food was just okay. I feel that we could have had just as good a meal at an average chain restaurant and paid half the price. The desert was very good though. Again, the staff and service were great! Absolutely no complaints there. The food however was just mediocre for what you're paying."}
{"text":"So delicious!!  Went during Happy Hour on Monday the 20th.  Fantastic prime rib sliders.  They just melted in my mouth.  My mother in law had the prime rib dinner.  It looked great and she said it tasted awesome.  She got it for $30. Not bad considering what you pay at a steak house.  My husband had the fish tacos and he said they were pretty dang good.  The cocktails were excellent!  Those girls at the bar know how to make a drink!  We all walked away full and with enough alcohol in us to enjoy the \"show\" out on Fremont Street."}
{"text":"I have dined at many Chart House restaurants across the country and they were all consistently good in regards to location, ambiance, food, and service. Unfortunately, this was not the birthday experience I had hoped for with my family. The hostess made us wait over 25 minutes for a reservation (Landrys VIP) even though the restaurant was empty. She was very unprofessional and didn't have a care in the world for me or the other groups waiting. The main server attempted to do a better job but I could easily overhear hear and other waiters and staff complaining about the customers near the salad area. Again, extremely unprofessional. I have always had great experiences at Chart House but this was a major let down especially on a day of celebration"}
{"text":"I really love this place, I called ahead made a reservation for one. I was seated by the aquarium which is so serene I immediately fell in love. My server was so helpful and nice. The food was so good and the drink menu was fantastic.  I seriously recommend this place to anyone going downtown, I absolutely fell in love."}
{"text":"Went to the Chartreuse for their $19.61 Prime Rib deal.  It was Spectacular.  Great cut of meat, done to perfection and our party of 4 was served by a young man named Joshua.  The whole evening was outstanding.  Joined the Landry's select club and that helped with the bill as well.  Had not been to the Chart House for a while, but we will be back more frequently after this wonderful evening of food, beverages and service."}
{"text":"Spent a few evenings here at the bar... the fish are large, the drinks are stiff, the bartenders are friendly, and the appetizers are tasty. I recommend the sizzling mushrooms, which were an ample portion and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Had lunch here.  The lobster & shrimp spring rolls were simply good, nothing outstanding there. I had a cup of the lobster bisque and my Boyfriend had a cup of the clam chowder.  If we had known that those soups were that good we would have ordered bowls of the stuff and skipped the salads.  The bisque had a great lobster flavor and nice chunks of lobster meat. The clam to potato ratio in the chowder was spot on and also had that creamy chunky texture that makes a chowder special.  I had the roasted beet salad which was slightly disappointing in that the beet pieces were small and overwhelmed by the onions and mandarin orange slices. I would have liked to have seen more feta and less dressing. My Boyfriend had the Asian Chicken salad, it looked ok, but nothing special about it either.  Food was good but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I had high expectations based on reviews, but was very disappointed in the prime rib I ordered, it was impossible to cut this meat with a steak knife and very tough and chewy, what a let down for the price. Will not visit this restaurant again for prime rib."}
{"text":"Downtown Golden Nugget. Great dining. The aquarium views are phenomenal. I am still in love with the  Crab, Avocado & Mango Stack!"}
{"text":"On a Tuesday at 7pm, three of us walked in to be seated. The hostess asked if we had reservations, we didn't. The restaurant was 75% empty. She asked us to take a seat in the waiting area so we did. About a minute after we sat down some other people came in too. Said they didn't have reservations either. The hostess gathered up  menus for them and immediately had them follow her to a table. As they walked by us one of the ladies apologized to us because they were being seated before us. We waited a bit more and the hostess came back to her station and then walked away again without speaking to us. We were confused as to what she was doing and left the restaurant."}
{"text":"What I found ridiculous are as follows: Cost: $70/person including tip and tax. We didn't order dessert. We had a salad, drinks for 3 and no alcohol. Only ordered one entree per person.   Service: really pushy. They force you to have everything and make it rather embarrassing to reject it.   Food: it's mediocre. My mother ordered shrimp entree. It was hard and not juicy. I don't know why/how they overcook shrimp so much. On the other hand, rice was undercooked. Caesar salad was really terrible. It was ultra salty. Lobster was ok, but rather mediocre for $72 entree.   What I found kinda interesting was just fish tank. But you can see fish tank in the swimming pool too, so why bother?  If you want to waste your money because you won in casino, go ahead and eat here.  Otherwise, I recommend to check out Paradise buffet in downtown. It is only $16 per person w drink. There are tons of better deals in buffet in las vegas hotels. Bellagio is good and even Caesars palace buffet costs less than this.   I believe if I pay extra money like more than $50 per person, I expect a better return and quality food, and unfortunately, this restaurant failed my expectation miserably. Never returning here. Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot an happy hour is nice but dinner is even better...went for five days just to get away !!! Stay at golden Nugget downtown Vegas this spot is in side it's worth the trip downtown"}
{"text":"We went during Happy Hour.  Calamari was done perfectly, and presented in a slightly different and delightful manner.  Spinach and Artichoke dip was a little too bland, and certainly could have had more crostini for the volume of dip.  I didn't taste the prime rib sliders, but those that did were OK with it, but not overly impressed.  Our server was not nearly the best we've ever experienced, and maybe should train a little longer."}
{"text":"In my opinion this restaurant is over rated!  I did some research on some places before surprising my wife with a restaurant that neither one of us had tried, and I chosed this one. What a big dissapointment!! It is nothing special, from the moment we checked in with a not so friendly hostess to the unattentive server that we had. The seating was probably the worst part, we were seated in a boot really close to three other couples! We could literally hear the other couples conversations. Now the food, to be frankly honest the only thing we liked and enjoyed of the whole meal was the calamari appetizer! My wife and I both had the Prime Rib and it was really chewy and flavorless. If you are planning on a special/nice dinner do not try this place! There are a lot much better choices in nicer Casinos."}
{"text":"Best meal downtown.  The staff was great and the food was delicious.  We sat next to the fish tank and it was beautiful to watch the fish with our cocktails and dinner.  Fried macaroni is delicious!  Our lava cake was overdone, but still pretty tasty."}
{"text":"First of all Service was Awful-   from the cranky old lady who sat us and read thru a script of stuff  while were trying to enjoy the view and start our evening. We said thank you and gave signs it was time for her to leave.           Then our waiter pushed the cocktails when we ordered a beer and martini  and then he tried again  later heard the waiters talking near our sections about some contest for drink orders.   But this place charges too much for the Applebee's style service.    Anyways the Prime Rib was good  but how do you mess that up when you have Lawry's in your name...     the fish was ewwwww and the rest was forgetable.     Save you Money and go Somewhere else.     The only thing worth a star is the View.    Staff was Awful and worthless.     Hopefully they close this place and put in a another concept, in that great location."}
{"text":"Don't order the trio of soups.  Came to the table lukewarm.  I kept tasting something funny in two of the soups, one was the lobster bisque.  I then I realized it was wine and way too much wine.  I told the waitress about the taste and she said it was sherry.  Who puts sherry in a soup?  The gazpacho was watered down salsa.  Also costs way too much money for what you get.  My partner had the fish and chips - also not good.  This was our 4th stay at the Golden Nugget, and the worst meal we had while in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We were recent guests at this restaurant. Diplomatically, I don't remember being more offended by the quality of our food. Mercifully, I can only recall that I had scallops which were flabby and tasteless, presented on a bed of mashed potatoes with a side of asparagus that was smothered in a horrible cream sauce. How do you make asparagus uneatable? An appetizer of lobster bisque was heavy and lacked any resemblance to a quality composition. It made me think of Campbell's creamed tomato soup. The ubiquitous and much encouraged lava cake was an uninteresting throwback to the 50s, as was the tired decor of the room. I couldn't even drown my sorrow in a decent glass of wine. Congratulations, Chart House, on presenting one of the most thoughtless wine lists I've encountered, which is saying something, since most wine lists are poorly constructed. The featured Rodney Strong Sauvignon blanc was an over oaked mess. Whatever my wife ordered, and took away in a doggie bag, went straight into the garbage can when we got home. And the prices! Holy Mother of God, this place ain't cheap. At least I wasn't paying, but I felt sorry for the poor sap who was. Service was polite and pedestrian, if not a bit pushy on their apparent signature dishes. Well, I'm signing off on this joint."}
{"text":"Terrible service:( Came here on a Sat evening at around 7 Not very busy, but yet waited forever for our drinks. And then one drink order was wrong.  Ordered salads, finally after 30 minutes we asked what the problem was. Our server apologized but said it wasn't his fault. We know it wasn't his fault, but where was his manager?  Waited another half hour for food, again no explanation. Had the baked shrimp, pretty dry. At the end of our meal, our server again apologized, we said his manager should have come over. He shrugged. Said he hoped we'd be back Don't think so."}
{"text":"We were rushed from appetizers to meal. When we told the manager there was sand in the scallops he looked at us like we were crazy.   Would not eat here again"}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner and evening with my husband! It's been 10 years since we were last in Scottsdale, and we chose to have dinner at the Chart House for \"old times sake\". We were not disappointed. Hummus trio appetizer, coconut shrimp entree with three dipping sauces, and chopped spinach salad... And of course, wine. It was all delicious and served very capably by our nice server, Ana. If you want a nice meal in a relaxing water view setting, complete with white tablecloths, Chart House is a great choice. We highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here today. Specially when my server arrived to my table his name is  RANDY I must say he made me feel welcome I really enjoyed dining here and RANDY kept it fun with lots of laughtwt. Can't wait to visit RANDY again ."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, beautiful setting with quality food and reasonable pricing. The soup trio app is fantastic, as are the lobster shrimp rolls! This place deserves more praise and recognition than it gets!!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat and drink, was very impressed with the food and service.  Must visit if in Vegas, the Golden Nugget was the best place to visit."}
{"text":"Chart House is a chain in the Landry's family of restaurants, but don't let the fact it's a chain dissuade you from checking it out. In a town of celebrity chefs, and literally thousands of dining options, the Chart House at the Golden Nugget holds its own.  This is not the first visit to the Chart House. I live in close proximity to the one in Marina Del Rey, and my wife and I dine at the Las Vegas location whenever we stay at the Nugget. I can honestly say I do not remember a bad experience at the Las Vegas location, and this weekend was no exception. Both the service and the food were top notch. This particular evening we were in the mood for steak, and did not want to pay Vic and Anthony's inflated prices.  We started with the crab, shrimp, and vegetable fritters, a diversion from our usual lobster bisque. These were great, and the kimchee sauce is a nice twist. Our entrees were the prime rib for myself (Callahan cut, of course) and the filet medallions for my wife. Both were cooked perfectly to our preference, and satisfied our carnivorous cravings. Service was great, and our waitress was friendly and very accommodating.  My only gripe is the beer selection. VERY limited. These days everyone is into these craft brews and etc, to only offer the usual junk seems like a misstep. I wanted some kind of amber, and best I could get was a Sam Adams. While annoying, I didn't deduct any stars for this.   TIP: Sign up for the Landry's Select Club. You'll get a $25 reward once you spend $250 in a year. I believe you also get $25 just for signing up, but I can't remember if it has to be used on a future visit.  Thanks Chart House, for another great and reasonably priced meal. Will repeat!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here off and on for over 20 years.  This will be a short and sweet review.  We ordered the oysters Rockefeller, which had to be sent back as the oysters smelled and tasted like rotten fish.  Our main order was put in wrong, and served our fish with peanut sauces when we specified plain olive oil.  Manager came over and said she was sorry and oysters would be removed but she eally didn't care.  She said there must have been a mis-understanding as to why the waitress delivered the wrong dish.  Nothing was done or anything offered to compensate. Taking ownership and just apologizing would have been a great place to start. The Chart House is a dump. They should be ashamed to have management like this. Food was horrible. Never coming back.  I love the owners reality show but he should make this restaurant an episode."}
{"text":"Ordered roasted beat salad $11, delicious flavor combination. The portions are more than sufficient. The hummus trio is unanticipatedly wonderful. The fried mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Great place in a beautiful setting! BEST MARGARITA I have had since I've been here!!! (ULTIMATE MARGARITA). NICK was a great waiter, very attentive and had some great suggestions for our meal. Everything from start to finish (another must have, chocolate lava cake with homemade ice cream!!!!)  Ended our night on a really positive note that there are still honest people in the world bc my hubby left his wallet at the table. We realized and went right back to the restaurant where the bus boy Juan had found it. Definitely a place to check out if you have not done so already. I recommend sitting on the outside patio with the fireplace, so perfect!"}
{"text":"We were staying in the Golden Nugget and one of the first things you see is this amazing restaurant with its huge floor-to-ceiling fish tank. We started with the oysters on the half shell- Fanny Bay oysters just bursting with briny juice and went on to the seafood tower for two. Those oysters are to date the best my husband and I have ever eaten and they were huge. The seafood tower tasted fresh-caught and included more oysters, shrimp, a split lobster tail and split king crab legs. For our entree, we got the grilled swordfish topped with crab, asparagus and bearnaise. He loved it, I was less crazy about it because it came on top of some kind of spicy sauce that was not on the menu. We could not stop dreaming of those oysters, so we actually went back the next evening for dinner and sadly, they were out of them. We ordered the seafood tower and the waitress told us they only had saved enough for the towers! Score! I probably could have eaten a bucket of those, they were so delicious .My husband got an order of kimchi calamari and I could not stop eating it. We also had the coconut shrimp which come butterflied in an edible rice paper \"clamshell\" and they were delicious too. The sauces were especially good. The hot chocolate lava cake comes with vanilla heathbar toffee ice cream and is too big for one person- split it!  It is a lovely room with the aquarium-quality fish tank dominating the decor. The service was excellent. I am in a wheelchair and every accommodation was made for me. They did not try to give me a less desirable table or shunt me off into a corner like other restaurants have done. This is the first place we are eating at when we go back to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Loved our dining experience at Chart House last Tuesday, Aug. 20. It was our 30th Wedding Anniversary and we wanted to go somewhere that combined decent food with a view, but would not bust our budget in the process. So used Open Table to make our reservations and mentioned it was our anniversary in the Comments Section. We had tried to get in for Mother's Day this year but it was booked-had driven past it from Scottsdale Road before but never actually seen the place. We were pleasantly surprised at the beautiful stone entrance surrounded by water with a sizable number of ducks.   Once inside we were handed menus that said Happy 30th Anniversary at the top. After we ordered, the Server presented them to us wrapped in a bow as a memento. How unique and thoughtful a gesture that was-we were blown away. I ordered the Crusted Tilapia meal-real tasty. Actually it was a package for 2 that included appetizer, soup or salad, main course, and dessert. Everything was tasty and our view of the lake and ducks was magnificent. Quite a memorable way to celebrate our milestone anniversary.  We definitely plan to go back there and will recommend to others. Very impressed with the ambiance, the service, and the meal. The entire dining experience was one we will never forget."}
{"text":"Great dinner for our big group. Best part was the great service We celebrated a family member's 75th birthday with a big group. The great service made the dinner! We had a snob in our group of 10 that was perfectly neutralized by our server Ott. He indulged her every complaint and criticism with a smile which saved the night. I was personally embarrassed for our snob's behavior but Ott rolled with the punches. He brought out several glasses of wine for her to taste. He also exchanged a perfectly good salad. The food was good, as expected. The setting is very cool because of a gigantic saltwater fish tank with more than 100 fish.  Thanks Ott!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and service. Maggie the bartender is AMAZING! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were a party of 11 that had reservations for Christmas Eve at 8:30pm. We did not get seated till 9:15pm. What's the point of reservations if we still have to wait over 15 mins. They ran out of prime rib, our seafood dishes were cold and bland. Overall not a good experience at all. Will not come back here. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"call me old school but the Chart House is not what it used to be. I grew up in SoCal and used to go to the ones in Redondo and Malibu. they would have a basic steaks, seafood menu. the menus were actually wood planks. They now offer all this new cuisine which basically adds up to smaller portions for more money. They used to serve humungous Australian Lobster tail...now it's iny \"cold water lobster\". The Chart House would be a place for hungry sailors and surfers. Now it's more of a corporate chain trying to compete with the McCormicks and Shmidts of the world."}
{"text":"Gorgeous setting and ambiance.  The service was amazing and we loved the fish tank and food.  I had the steak and it was not my first choice but I have another opportunity to try the sea bass with a special person in the future so I'm definitely going to go there again.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Disaster from the moment we came in.  The music was so loud we asked the waiter to turn it down 3 times. Thought we were going to have a relaxing evening and ended like a disco night.  Waiter gave us no specials and said nothing.  Bread was delivered with a long hair in the basket and old salad leaf stuck to the side. Water was delivered with something floating it the bottom of glass.  One of our salad dishes stuck to the table cloth when they picked it up , thus the bottom of the dish was dirty.  Our dessert which we ordered was the wrong one delivered. Very disappointing .  We have given this place several tries, but this was the last straw. Never again."}
{"text":"I have had a great experience both times that I have eaten here. The food is very good and so is the service. My favorite is the macademian nut crusted Mahi Mahi and the chocolate Lava cake. My husband had the sea bass and was very happy. The server was a little robotic but everything came in a timely manner and she checked on us often. Overall, it was a very nice experience."}
{"text":"Went to dinner on Sun evening. Beautiful decor in a beautiful setting on a pond. Ordered shrimp cocktail (it's a seafood place right?).    Waitress brought me five shrimps that apparently died from malnutrition. Nice presentation with dry ice. Shrimp was room temp (barf).  Check please.. Off to Ruth's Chris.   This Chart House is not the same as the one in Waikiki (started by same owner though).  Run.."}
{"text":"I arrived on time for my reservation but the hostess twirled her hair for 5 minutes before acknowledging me. Then she told me to sit at the bar. My table was ready but she wasn't. Really?   My friends and I were looking forward to the once infamous salad bar, but we discovered 5 empty ingredient bowls and a manager too busy to restock right then. Attitudes are awful. So was the food. Time for the restaurant to rethink who and what they are."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar here. Great fish tank. Best cocktail waitresses downtown. Biggest shrimp I've ever seen in shrimp cocktail."}
{"text":"Would not recommend.  Ahi was tasteless and the Mahi was the worst fish my husbands ever tasted.  Service was also bad.  Water and wine glasses empty for long period of time.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Quite a disappointing experience in general.  The restaurant was almost empty on a Monday night, but the hostess acted as if it would be a significant effort to seat us. The waiter made soup or salad appear to be a feature of our very pricey, but subpar meals.  Unhappy to find those additional charges when the bill arrived.  Won't be visiting this place again!"}
{"text":"We have been to numerous Charthouse restaurants in the past and this one in particular many years ago. View is spectacular but unfortunately that is the best part of the dinner. I had New York steak and a Pasta dish. The slices of steak were tough and had no flavor. The pasta noodles were over cooked, and stuck in a large ball. Had what I thought was a $10 meal for $35. Salad bar was good but not outstanding."}
{"text":"It'd been a long time since I have been to a Chart House and I have forgotten how good they can be.  We arrived on a Sunday night so things were slow with the store maybe 20% full.  Service was a bit slow to start, most likely due to the table next to us that had pair that had apparently been drinking for several hours and were doing a good job of causing the server a case of heartburn.  Once they left, service leaped forward and was fine for the rest of the evening.  The salad bar was good as was the fish."}
{"text":"Disappointing.    Our family went for Easter Brunch (under the impression it was going to be a buffet brunch but that's a different issue) and let's say it is an Easter we won't forget.  It was an off-the-menu brunch instead, so we ordered accordingly.  My father-in-law found a live ladybug in his salad from the salad bar, I had a shell in my lobster bisque and twice had to return my crab cake due to it being uncooked in the center (isn't this a seafood restaurant?).  While we waited for coffee to be brewed and our dessert to be delivered, we expected to have our table cleared in preparation.  This was not the case.  There were still dished on our table when they finally had fresh coffee for us.    Our server really tried her best to remain calm and courteous in the face of these problems.  I'm disappointed we had very little interaction with the manager since we had a table that seemed plagued with problems.    This restaurant is supposed to be professional and highly regarded.  I fail to see the professionalism that one would associate with such an establishment."}
{"text":"This place was pretty disappointing.   Tried several different items. The salmon, Mahi, and the short ribs. Both the salmon and the Mahi were pretty bland and not worth what they charged for them. The short ribs were very tender but the sauce it was in just wasn't palatable. I noticed that everyone else that got the short ribs had not taken more than a couple of bites.   The lobster bisque and the calamari & friends to start were the best dishes we had, but it may have just seemed that way because after soup and appetizers the dinner went downhill.  2 stars go to the entrees but since the appetizers were good, this place gets 3 stars."}
{"text":"Coconut Shrimp appetizer, and Ahi tuna entree were both amazing.    The chicken BLT was interesting, and apparently the manager's favorite, but it isn't much more than a fried chicken sandwich.  Stick to seafood choices at a Chart House.  Representative of the brand of Chart House even without the ocean view.  (If you can ever get to the one in Dana Point in Orange County, CA, you won't be disappointed.)"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Made a reservation for 8. Got there at 740, checked in. Hostess said it would be closer to 8, understandable. We waited for 20 min. Watching other people walk up and get seated. By 815 I asked how much longer. She said they were still waiting for tables. Said everyone before us had a reservation and checked in before us... if you don't have tables available then don't make reservations. By 820 we left, don't waste your time. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Walked in 1120pm, they close at 1130. Harris, Michael and late night staff were amazing. We were treated very very well even though we were the last guest of the night. They did not rush us like most places do when it's closing time. Appetizers were fantastic the \"crab cake\" to die for; try it, you'll love it! Very accommodating to my tired daughter who reminded me that she only had one meal all day. LOL  Great food, AMAZING staff, definitely eating here again."}
{"text":"We had 6 adults   and 2 children in our party to celebrate an anniversary, we arrived at 5.30 on a Monday Night, we were seated in 10 minutes at a table across the restaurant away from other diners.   I thought something might be a little wrong when I had to make two trips  from the bar to bring our own drinks to the table.    We were seated and were given menus.  That is when the real waiting started.  We asked if there were any specials and we were told it is on the menu, my father informed the waiter that he is legally blind and asked for assistance, so the waiter proceeded to read the fish specials over the shoulder of his wife.   While the group was deciding, my father ordered a bottle of champagne to be delivered for this special occasion.   Glasses were brought to the table but I think they had to go to France to get the selection.    The table presentation was very nice but we were given an additional black napkin to everyone but the patriarch.    Finally the last napkin was delivered and the champagne was poured.   Our orders were taken and then the real waiting began.   At 6.45pm (remember we were seated at 5.30) we inquired where our appetizers were and asked for another drink order.   We were told they were coming.   The shrimp and oysters were delivered but the three bowls of lobster bisque soup did not arrive.   When they finally arrived they were  luke warm.   They were sent back and when they were returned, you could tell that they had been microwaved in the same bowl.   Needless to say, there were returned again.      We again waited for the entrees and had to call the waiter over to service the table, to remove the dirty glasses and again refresh the drink orders.    Finally at 7.20pm our entrees arrived.   The presentation was very good but some of the orders were missing items.   (the filet did not arrive with the additional crab that was ordered and when it was delivered  it was in a  ramekin.   The mashed potatoes were cold.   We were not going to send them back to the microwave.  When we finished the waiter came to ask if we wanted dessert but we were never offered coffee.   We asked for the bill.   The bill was delivered but the dirty dinner dishes were never removed.     Suffice it to say the whole evening was a disaster.   My father wanted this dinner to be a special for my husbands and my 29th wedding anniversary.   We left after my husband his \"third chat with the Manager\" leaving a 1.00 tip on a 450.00 tab.   My husband told the manager he owed the tip to the waiter for not providing the proper support  to get the job done.   We also mentioned that  they should clean up the goose poop from the front enterance before the dinner service is started.    We realize that part of the resturant's charm is the water setting with the wildlife but to walk trough it entering and leaving is not very desirable.       This was not our first experience with this property but will be our last until management is skilled on proper service for a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was such a pleasant surprise.  In all my trips to Vegas, I haven't spent much time downtown.  We were meeting a photographer at the Golden Nugget this time, though, so we decided to explore a little.  The Chart House lured us in with their gorgeous decor and particularly their giant aquarium in the middle.  What was going to just be a drink and apps turned into dinner.   We started out with a yummy Hummus trio- I especially liked the Edamame flavor, which was refreshingly different.  For dinner, I had the seafood mixed grill: mahi, mediterrenean shrimp, and a crab cake.  It was all fantastic, especially the shrimp.  I could eat that shrimp every day for the rest of my life.  The fiance had a NY Strip- beautifully cooked and tender.  We also got a side of fried mac n' cheese and it was heavenly.  Service was top-notch.  The mango mojito was fantastic, too.  This is just a great place for a really nice, but not pretentious, meal on Fremont Street."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in there for dinner tonight and was pleasantly surprised. Our waitress was fantastic her name is Sabrina. She was very professional and had a great personality. The whole ticket. Our last time was very disappointing. Sabrina changed our minds."}
{"text":"A friend of mine who was staying at the Golden Nugget, so decided to meet up for lunch. Since she was staying there already, we decided on the Chart House.            We were seated in front of the large fish tank. It was beautiful. The atmosphere was bright, lively, and clean. Our two servers were very polite and attentive to our needs.                                               I had ordered chopped salad. It was very good. The lobster bisque soup was average in flavor. All they did was add lobster bits on top of the soup as garnish. That was kind of disappointing and a lazy way of preparing soup. At least put larger chunks of lobster pieces. We both ordered the grilled salmon fish, it was very good. Although the cut portion of the fish was on the small side. Overall our check totaled to $37.00 prior to tipping out. That's with one glass of wine, 2 salads, cup of lobster bisque soup, and 2 grilled salmon entrees. Humm...not bad. Next time I'll try eating at the bar area in front of the fish tank."}
{"text":"What to say about chart house that they don't already know! They are truest Devine, Amazing, stupendous, exquisite and delicious. I love taking my son here and sitting by the ginormous fish tank they have,  all I can hear from my almost three your old is NEMO AND DORY! They have a amazing atmosphere and great food, I recommend the shrimp scampi during lunch and the chocolate molten cake for Desert! Never leave with out Desert!"}
{"text":"The beautiful setting and lake view can't make up for bad service. Our waitress clearly didn't know the menu, took our orders, then came back to take them again. Told me I couldn't order the truffle fries in the dining room - only at the bar. After a few rounds, she said her manager ok'd it. They arrived at the END of our meal - and without the truffle aspect of the dish - they were just plain fries. The lobster bisque was great. The stuffed shrimp was overcooked. The lava cake was unparalleled - absolutely wonderful, but the rest of the experience was just awful. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"If your in the mood for fresh fish or slow cooked prime rib then the Chart House in Scottsdale is the place. Its a little hidden gem on camelback lake. The views just after sunset are out of this world. Nothing beats sitting on the deck over looking the lake and enjoying a great glass of wine and their famous handmade lava cake. I recommend it with the chef made peanut butter ice cream. They also have a killer happy hour Monday through Friday from 4:30-7:00. If your looking for a great night out I highly recommend the Chart House in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in on Monday April 27th for National Prime Rib Day that the restaurant was promoting.  I made reservation and we got there 15 mins early.  The place looked moderately busy, but not packed.  Not sure why it still took the hostess so long to seat us.  We got seated, and yes, the view is beautiful, but the service was very very slow.  We tried to order the oysters as appetizers, but they were out, so we went with the Ahi Tuna Tacos.  It took our server 15 mins to come back to tell us that they are out of those as well?  Why would it take them that long when the restaurant was not that busy to begin with?  Needless to say, we are disappointed in that.  Then comes the prime ribs.  I'd say the prime rib is just average because it looks and taste like the prime ribs you get at a buffet. Then our server just disappeared.  It was the longest dinner service which I don't understand how that is even possible when it's slow and on a Monday night.  I've been to the one out on Redondo Beach, CA. and LOVE the service and food there.  I just don't think the one here in Arizona is as good as the one in California.  I would say I would not come back here to dine because it's really just the \"view\" and since I love food, I expect better food for the prices on the menu."}
{"text":"Chart House is a beautiful restaurant with an extensive--and expensive--seafood menu. We wanted to save a few bucks, so we stopped in for happy hour instead of dinner. Great prices on food and drinks, but while the drinks were a steal, the food was a bit disappointing.  My husband had a $3 Miller Lite, and I had two $4 Beefeaters and soda. Healthy pours on that gin! For snacks, we chose the $6 lettuce wraps and $7 firecracker shrimp. Surprisingly, for a place known for its seafood, I much preferred the lettuce wraps, which had a nice combination of chicken and vegetables with a sweet soy glaze. The shrimp were touted as being \"tossed in a spicy kim chee sauce,\" which sounded great, but the sauce was more like the \"spicy\" (not spicy) mayo served on sushi rolls, and the shrimp themselves were flaccid and flavorless.  The fish tank is worth a visit itself, and you really can't beat those HH prices in the downtown tourist corridor. But next time I'll stick with the drinks and maybe an order of lettuce wraps if I'm hungry."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much an easy three stars across the board. I came here on a business trip where the menu is pre-fixed and you just pick a main course and drinks, etc.   The view of the pond, yes pond not lake, was nice but the highlight was the little bunnies that wandered about outside as you ate. (I am glad rabbit wasn't an option on the menu. It would have been weird). The waiters were all nice, but service was not very prompt.   The meat was cooked just right but the side dishes were failures. The meat was definitely the main event, but with no backup dancers."}
{"text":"After waiting overnight to recover from our dining experience I've decided that the performance by the Chart House was so poor that I had to comment.   Upon arriving to a restaurant that was less than 1/2 full we were asked to wait about 10 minutes to be seated so they could make sure the servers weren't too busy.  This should have been our first warning.   After being seated it became clear that they were terribly understaffed as it took another 10 minutes for a server to come over to tell us she'd be with us soon (another 5-10 minutes).  Recognizing a full dinner would likely be a three hour affair,  we ordered 1 bowl of soup and two small salads.  The soup came out pretty quickly,  but the salads took nearly 1/2 hour to arrive,  and then only after I flagged down our server who we hadn't seen since she took our order.   The chopped salad was more like an onion salad,  but we knew asking for something else would only make things worse. We didn't see our server again until we had already been finished for 10 minutes.   We asked for the check,  immediately gave our credit card,  only for our server to disappear once again.  Finally,  I had to give chase simply to pay.   When I spoke with the manager about our experience there seemed to be a mixed expression of recognition,  apology and helplessness.   Was quite odd that there seemed to be plenty of time for all the servers to repeatedly push Landry dining club memberships,  but not enough to serve the guests in a timely manner.   As a return guest I was surprised by how poor the experience was.  Seems to have been a trend over the last few visits. While we probably will return in the future,  Chart House is unfortunately out of our regular dining rotation."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to chart house and we love it. We started with lobster bisque for the wife and clam chowder for me and they were excellent.  For the main course, the Mrs. had swordfish and she said it was done perfectly and he was asked for a recipe. I'm a steak man and I had a 14 ounce New York strip cooked medium. It was absolutely the best steak I've ever had. Added to that was garlic mashed potatoes and they were excellent as well. The drawback for the main meal was the salad.   We finished with a soufflé and it melted in your mouth. This place deserves five stars. Our waiter, Paris, was as good as the meal."}
{"text":"I should note at the beginning that my review may have been better if not for the inordinately glowing recommendations of our server, Harris. He started out immediately telling us that nearly everything on the menu would be the best we ever had. He likes to use the phrase \"flavor profile\" and it was his suggestion that the Filet would be the best I'd tasted that caused me to order it.  It wasn't. Not even close. Not only was the stake just ok, it was undercooked (I ordered medium rare, not bloody). In addition, I'd asked for a glass of the Pinot Noir that he suggested to be delivered just prior to my meal so I could enjoy the two together. After another waiter brought our entrees and I was 1/2 way through my mediocre steak, Harris showed up to ask how things were. \"Just ok. And where is my wine?\" That led to his over explaining about the pain of splitting a check at another table... blah blah blah.   I was within 1-2 bites of finishing my steak when Harris appeared again with my wine. \"No thanks, Harris. It's just too late.\"  My SO's chicken was dry and tasteless. If it weren't for the lovely, large aquarium nearby the meal would have been a total bust. Harris would be better served to promise less greatness. I wouldn't have been so disappointed if he hadn't been so certain in his glowing recommendations.   Given this experience and the many other options in Vegas, I'll likely not return."}
{"text":"An earlier post suggested skipping the drinks. I concur. The mango mojito lacks rum, but tasty all the same. Great ambience. The view was fantastic. The food was ok but over priced. Don't order alcohol."}
{"text":"Chart House is pretty much what you would expect from a west coast restaurant chain that has been around for twenty years.  Corporate cookie cutter menu, salad bar, decour and staff.  It does overlook a man made lake in McCormick Ranch and the water view is a nice change of pace for us desert rats.  The food and service has been hit and miss over the past few years ranging from pretty good to disasterous.  I can honestly say this was the site of one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had in Arizona.  I've been back since and things were improved... they couldn't have gotten any worse.  The fact that it's near my house and I may go there twice a year says it all.  It really has the potential to become a neighborhood favorite if management ever got a clue."}
{"text":"While the service here is great, the food lacks flavor. I went with a party of 6 and nobody was too thrilled with what they got. I ordered the shrimp and scallops which were highly recommended by the waiter and I was extremely disappointed. My friend got the curried shrimp and said it was \"okay\". Another friend got a piece of fish simply grilled, and luckily that's hard to mess up. We didn't stay for dessert, so can't comment on those. But can definitely say entrees are overpriced and lacking flavor and creativity."}
{"text":"I had never been inside The Golden Nugget and I wasn't expecting much, but boy was I surprised! We decided to eat at Chart House after reading their awesome reviews. We were seated immediately by the aquarium. It was beautiful and and amazing! I ordered a seafood platter and boyfriend ordered Macadamia crusted Mahi. Both dishes were wonderful. His dish was huge and cooked perfectly. My platter had fried calimari, fried fish, fries, coconut shrimp, tempura fried lobster tail with tempura battered veggies. It was all wonderful and not greasy at all. A wonderful dining experience! I would definitely recommend this place. It is a little pricey, but definitely worth what you get for the price!"}
{"text":"When walking by this place, you are drawn in by the aquarium. We were seated next to the aquarium wall, with the many assortments of fish, as acquaintances, passerby. My mother in law, would jokingly point and say, \"i would like this one, and that one!\" Although I am not sure if she meant on her plate, or to take home? We particularly had good service. Altogether the ambiance was fun, but I would not suggest for small children as it is a quieter restaurant in a rather big casino environment.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their appetizers on the table. My MIL had the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, which came stunningly on a vapor-like dry-ice display. Very cool. I turned to the Menage soups, which were size proportionate. In this moment I realized I am not fond of tomato based gazpacho, in general, as this a second attempt - but you may like it. However, the lobster bisque was extremely creamy,  and the clam chowder was the same with many small pieces of clam.  My main dish was the mixed seafood grill, which again was proportionate. I was definately rooting for the grilled citrus salmon on the plate- delicious!. The asperagus was perfect as a refesher when moving between the crab cakes, shrimp & Salmon. My husband had the  Spiced Yellowfin Ahi to Chef recommendation (Slightly seared & rare), which was also delish. In fact I would have been greedy and jealous had I not had a good plate myself.  The apple crisp was good, with a slight sweetness. Not what you would want for a sweettooth (i would go for the creme brulee if so), it was perfect to my taste- but once again, not super sweet.  Overall, a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Last night we had the WORST dining experience ever!  Normally we love the Chart House. We are even Landry club card members.  It took 15 minutes to get even a glass of water, another 20 to get a glass of wine, 40 minutes to receive our COLD entree.  The waitress  was running.  Where was the manager..arguing with other patrons!!!  Why didn't he help out if they were short staffed? Maybe he needs to take a lesson in being on the team!  Don't know if we will ever come back.  Sad, as we have been loyal customers for over 25 years.  People, find somewhere else to dine."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience and some exceptional seafood here, if you're staying at the golden nugget, you need to dine at the chart house. You won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"Staff were so friendly and the food was to die for! We had a party of 14 for a 40th birthday and they accommodated us perfectly. We had a reservation and they asked the occasion so each Menu had \"Happy 40th Birthday\" on them, and hey rolled the menus into scrolls and send them home with us. Every single person in our group loved their meal. Perfect and memorable night!"}
{"text":"My husband and I  stopped in here this past weekend.  The Bloody Mary's are to die for, and eating off the Happy Hour menu made our dinner really affordable.  Awesome service and the fish tank is amazing."}
{"text":"I had my little Vegas reception at the chart house and they really did pull out all the stops to make it a special evening. Service was excellent.  Great fresh seafood selections, perfect steaks and fun desserts. I'll be back if I have a big win next time and will dream of that ahi tuna."}
{"text":"Kinda just ran into this place, thought I'd have a drink and realized it was a restaurant. I ended up ordering a chopped salad for $8, to my surprise, it was huge and tasted great!  Also ordered the chilled lobster and shrimp spring rolls.  They were good, just not amazing.  The fish tank is gorgeous!  I love the green eel in there.  Overall the service was great, quick and very friendly.  Check out happy hour to save quite a few bucks and still enjoy some great food!"}
{"text":"I hate to write this, but this Chart House location is fair at best.  I frequent a Chart House near my home and love it so I had high expectations for the Las Vegas location. Let's start off with the positive -- I heard that they recently renovated the restaurant and it shows.  There is a large fish tank that is the center of the restaurant -- so pretty.  The restaurant is rather small so you feel cramped in depending on where your table is located.  Janea was our server for the night -- we had some questions on the menu and she had to leave and ask someone else each time.  Doesn't really give you a vibe that she knows what she's doing.  She also didn't come around enough to check if we needed anything like drink refills etc.  One of the appetizers that Chart House is known for is their crab avocado mango stack.  It's an appetizer that I get every time I go to the location near my home because it's so good.  This appetizer in the Las Vegas Charthouse?  Not that great.  One of my friends had the prime rib and it was loaded with fat -- should you expect that for an entree that cost $32.00?  I don't think so.  I had the stuffed shrimp which was nothing to write home about and someone else had the shrimp pasta entree -- they didn't like theirs either.  How could this location be so different?  I don't know but it is.  I do know one thing -- we won't be back to the Las Vegas location."}
{"text":"Horribly run restaurant. We left 30 minutes after our reservation when we met another group in the bar who had been waiting for over one hour and 30 minutes past their reservation time. The worst part is the host wouldn't give us a straight answer about when we might get seated. You could tell he knew it would be a lllloooonngg time but his bosses must have told him he wasn't allowed to say that because irate customers were freaking out on him and instead of just being honest about the wait time he would give vague and deceptive answers. It was really bad and looking at the other reviews it seems to be a normal problem with them..."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday and it was really nice that they give you a menu printed with your name, and Happy Birthday across the top. They tie it with a ribbon and present it to you, before you leave. They also give you a yummy piece of mud pie.  The huge fish tank is awesome, but it apparently dictated the set up of the entry, which is confusing. The entry isn't marked, and you have to guess that you are supposed to wait on the right side, if the hostess has stepped away.   The food was not as good as I expected, for the price. I believe my crab stuffed flounder or sole filet was around $25-30. It was a bit bland. The most disappointing part was that I bit into three large bones, on my very first bite. I've filleted fish, and the chef or whoever stuffed the fish, should have felt those bones.  My boyfriend was happy with his coconut shrimp. I tasted it and thought it was good, but not wonderful.  All in all, it was a relaxing meal in a nice atmosphere, with good service. Unfortunately, the food just wasn't quite enough to make me return. In a city where there are so many fantastic restaurants, there are places I like better."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for happy hour. Otherwise a little pricey for downtown. Service was great. The drinks and the apps we had were great. The dinner menu looked fantastic plus the fish tank is a great feature."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, but first let's get ther boo's out of the way. I made reservations about two weeks in advance because I wanted to be sure I got the time slot I wanted. I made reservations for 7:30, we arrived there at 7:15. The hostess said we would be seated closer to 7:30 and that was fine. So we sat in the bar... and sat... and sat some more. It was almost 8 till we were finally seated. I saw people walk in get seated shortly after but not us and it was just a party of four. Finally get seated then ordered more drinks.. that took awhile... ordered an appetizer and that took awhile.... then the soup comes out AND that takes awhile... finally our entrees didn't come out till 9:14.. (I was checking my watch then) so we didn't leave the restaurant till 10... I thinking they were really lacking waiters. If the hostess seated us at the time I made reservations then it wouldn't have been so bad. But eating so late leaves awfuly bloated. Ok ok, now the good part. This is one of the best seafood restaurants I've been to in Arizona. It's fresh and delicious. I didn't have the salad bar, but it looked really really good. They have a good wine list and the apps are good too. We were way too stuffed to try the lava cake, but there's always next time. Just make reservations an hour earlier, ha!"}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed having lunch at this phenomenal establishment!!  The food and service was awesome!!  Great food, great wine list, GREAT desserts!!  The huge fish tank was mesmerizing!!  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I expected much more based on the reviews. Food looks good but it's not tasty. It's basically the same fish you get at you average run of the mill chain restaurant. Too much batter on the fried fish, lack of flavor and everything just covered by butter and sauces. Yuk. Doubt we will be back to this and any other Landrys restos. It just Doesn't do it for us. We get much better quality fish and seafood elsewhere at much lower prices."}
{"text":"If you want \"waterfront\" in the desert, the the Chart House is the place to dine.  Situated in McCormick Ranch on a man made lake, this restaurant is nothing too special.  I started with the Chart House Salad which had a little too much dressing on it"}
{"text":"The Chart House is a high-end chain, with excellent food. The fish tank belongs in an aquarium, as it is a moving piece of art and a real distraction and conversation piece during your meal. We had a party of five adults, the service was flawless, the drinks flowed, our glasses were always full, and the food was very timely, without feeling rushed. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Have been to the Chart House many times over the years most recently last night. The food was good not over the top however the seafood was fresh Clam Chowder good again not great however the biggest disappointment was the salad bar which lists for $15.99 unless you purchase an entree then they try to make you feel as if its a bargain by adding it for $7.99. I would have no problem with the exuberant price but please give me something impressive this was a real let down. I would highly recommend reservations and try to specify a window seat as the views will impress and motivate your palate. Price of dinner with no wine just ice water was $107.00 with 20% tip so anticipate a much larger bill with cocktails. Wine list is impressive and this is a wonderful place to take a date if you love flaming torches and views over the lake again just make sure you get the window seat."}
{"text":"We always drop by the Chart House for happy hour. $5 drinks and half price applies $4/5/6 each. The atmosphere is that of a fine dinning restaurant, which it is. They have a huge fish tank , comfortable seats and food that is always unique and delicious. WAY better and cheaper that all of the other places to eat in the neighbouring hotel. chart House is in the Golden Nugget Hotel which everything is 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great seat on the patio overlooking the lake, with the sunset, tiki torches and fire pit, it was a perfect setting for a romantic dinner, although I am glad we were outside, being inside, the intereior was a bit dated, and the atmosphere, sparse.  Dinner was delicious (gazpacho, miso salmon, and tuna tartare), as well as the strawberry basil cocktail, the martini, and the tripple berry cobbler.  The waiter was attentive and helpful, although the hostess took FOREVER to get us seated even though there was no one else waiting.   great for a romantic evening, if you sit out on the patio."}
{"text":"I had Jillian as a server and WOW. She was amazing! She made sure we had everything we needed and kept us updated on our food and informed us of her favorite appetizers and it really helped us choose what we wanted! The food is pretty good but was way too expensive. The hostess were beyond amazing as well. The restaurant and bathrooms were very clean! Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Totally amazing Sea Bass!!! The preparation was very well done with a wonderful risotto!  When you eat, eat well!  Bravo to the chefs!!  That to Tedrick for such great service."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour apps and drinks. The tank was spectacular with the different varieties of fish.....I just wish we had better service. The young blonde girl who served us in the beginning was moody and irritable - told us wrong info regarding happy hour- generally made us feel unwelcome. Thanks goodness  another server came in and straightened her out and helped us. Minus 2 stars for the first server....otherwise cool setting and good apps at happy hour prices"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in their Easter Brunch.  I say Brunch lightly as we had 11:45 AM reservations and there wasn't anything on the menu that was anywhere close to Brunch.  My daughter was very disappointed that there wasn't anything other than meat and seafood dishes.  Two of us went to the Salad Bar-$18.00 for a below average salad bar.  Very disappointing experience.  The view is lovely, but that's the only positive thing to say."}
{"text":"The food isn't good. The fish tank was cool.   Had the Kim chee calamari which wasn't that flavorful but the highlight of the meal.   I had the halibut. For the size $34 is waaaaay too damn much. They know they unfroze it. Argh.   The only veggies that didn't have butter or some sort of dairy product on them were the green beans. And that meant that they served them plain. How come they couldn't get a little creative?   The fiancé had chicken and it wasn't seasoned well. Salt pepper cooked in olive oil is not seasoning. Dark meat or not.   Waste of $80 and they don't have a bathroom inside you have to go through the cigarette stank filled casino to use the rest room."}
{"text":"Even though they don't have many vegetarian choices, I managed to find delicious stuff I could eat.  Their gazpacho is AMAZING! and their Roasted beet salad is pretty good too. I also tried their hummus trio and it was pretty tasty. The service was just so, so.   I wish they had more substantial vegetarian choices, eating salad without a good protein only goes so far. I would like to see a pasta or a sandwich on the menu, but for what it is the food was great.  My coworkers ordered different dishes and everyone liked what they had.  I will probably go again because that is the go to place if you are in the area, but not because I am super impressed with the menu."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Chart House in years.  I thought we would try it and see how it goes.  PRIME RIB- Fabulouse.  Service- FABULOUS (ask for Kelly) Chopped Salad- AWESOME.  Try it with their homemade bleu cheese dressing.  YUMMY."}
{"text":"I have eaten here lots of times but just last Friday I went out for dinner and had Lobster. It was the sweetest Lobster that I have ever eaten outside of Maine, The view is great and the food is always first class."}
{"text":"The Golden Nugget has certainly improved since my last trip to Vegas. The Chart House space is beautiful and modern. There's a huge fish tank in the center of the space. If you're seated at the bar, it'd be quite a view.   The menu was similar to other Chart House restaurants I've been to. We had the Hummus appetizer, which was perfect to share while we had our cocktails. We shared 3 salads: the chopped, heirloom tomato, and roasted beet. We liked them all. For dinner: 2 pasta/seafood combinations, sea bass, lamb chops, and a twist on surf & turf (seared scallop and short ribs). The only disappointment was the short ribs (tender but flavorless). The portions were so generous, no room for dessert.   All in all an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"I made a reservation late on a Saturday for me and a friend after a long day of moving (seafood sounded good) and we ended up with the best seat in the house for a 'romantic dinner' LOL!  My girlfriend Kristen and I found it quite enjoyable too hahah!  Look at the photos; it was the only table in the corner facing the 'waterfront' with two walls of windows.    I highly recommend the bacon/spinach chopped salad!!! Yumyum!  I don't recommend the small salad bar for $16.99!!!! I do want to try their Cesar salad, it looks quite delicious.  I don't recommend the soup sampler...save your self the hassle and just order a full bowl of the lobster bisque or the clam chowder.    The Calamari is called Calamari & Friends...get it without the friends!  It comes with fried vegetables mixed-in (carrots, peppers etc).  I personally like my veggies fresh, not fried and my calamari lonely with lemon :) They did accommodate my preference when I asked for plain, lightly breaded and fried calamari.  And they did not over fry it to death like many places do in the valley.    I have eaten at Chart House a few times with my friend Kristen and she has gotten the crab cake every time, so I think it is safe to assume it is delicious!  I have had many of their fish dishes (halibut, mahi mahi, and salmon) and all have been good.  Nothing particularly stood out, but it was all great to eat which is why I come back.  Good seafood can be a rough find in the desert.    Service here is a bit dicey, you never know what you are going to get, some are better than others.  I also always feel like they are trying to hard sell me on more food, which annoys me.  Many times when I opt for seafood I am trying to eat 'lighter' and I don't need somebody hounding me to eat a four course meal.    I have had the lava cake here once and I give it two thumbs up!  It is quite large for a lava cake too so you can definitely share....if you want :)    As for location, obviously other Chart Houses are on the beach and have amazing locations, but for Scottsdale I guess it is as close to 'waterfront' as you can get!"}
{"text":"Love the aquarium, love the food but pay attention to your bill. Just came across a receipt from last months visit. They charged to sub a baked potato for the mash potatoes that came with the entree. I mean it was only $6, not going to break me but where's the logic?!  The mash potatoes as a side are $1 more so the restaurant saves a buck and charges you 6 more. Wow, smh!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had two seafood dishes - both 40 dollar range - Abd both disappointing!! They are basically average dishes that are significantly over-priced. The much toured kava chocolate dessert equally as disappointing - it wasn't even warm and it was store bought quality.  The service even worse - the girl did not even inquire as to whether we liked the dishes. The atmosphere is perhaps the only saving grace."}
{"text":"Wow, good seafood in Arizona and a table with a water view.  Does it get any better than that?  For my wife's birthday she wanted seafood. I made a reservation and told them it was my wife's birthday. When we arrived the hostess wished my wife a happy birthday and she gave us specially printed happy birthday menus.  Nice touch.  She also asked us if we wanted to be seated or if we'd like to wait about 5 minutes and get a table overlooking the water.  That was a no-brainer.  For appetizers I had the calamari (delicious!) and my wife had their New England clam chouder (also delicious!).  Main courses were Mediterranean Shrimp for me and Shrimp/Linguini for my wife.  We tasted each other's meal - both were very good but I liked the Mediterranean Shrimp better.  For dessert we shared their chocolate lava cake.  This concoction has about 2,000 calories per spoonful but it's worth the extra 10 hours you'll spend in the gym. Overall this was a wonderful meal.  I took a star off for the so-so waiter service."}
{"text":"Driven by too many times to count, and we finally made it in.  Seriously, the BEST PRIME RIB I've ever had, ever.  Scallops terrific, barramundi on bed of gorgonzola risotto good but not great.  Nice appetizers.  Kind of goofy, old-school salad bar but it was fresh and provided an instant salad.  Nice wine list.  I'll be back, but it will be hard to order something other then the spectacular prime rib. I don't know that I'd call this place a \"happenin' place,\" but, seriously, if you're in the mood for outstanding red meat, I came away very impressed. Service was competent.  Weird that it took 15 minutes to seat us when restaurant wasn't that busy and table was open and ready."}
{"text":"My husband, his mother & I recently dined at Chart House for the first time. It was a special occasion, an opportunity to try a restaurant that we have wanted to try for years. The setting is beautiful although we were seated far from the seats with a view. Our server started out strong with a wine suggestion that we all enjoyed. My shrimp entree was delicious. My mother-in-law found that her crab cakes were overwhelmed by the accompanying vegetables. But, my husband 's experience was terrible. He ordered the flounder which was the special. It arrived undercooked and cold. When our server finally returned to check on us, my husband asked that she take his dish to the kitchen and microwave it to warm it up. She took it away and didn't return for at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile his mother and I finished our meals. By the time his entree returned, his appetite was gone and he had them just box it up to take home. When we got the check we found that the special was $10 more than the already outrageous prices of other fish entrees. Our check was about $60 per person. We will never be back. There are just too many great, reasonably priced restaurants in the valley to put up with overpriced, mediocre food."}
{"text":"Great Thanksgiving meal. I had a similar meal at Busters on the Lake for cheaper last year but that doesn't take away from the good spinach and sweet potatoes. Good service, good bread, good view..."}
{"text":"just had a fairly good dinner here.  this is my first time in vegas, and i had my heart set on eating dinner at jose andres meat bazaar.  however- after spending all afternoon hoofing it on the strip, i really wasn't in the mood to head out again from where i was staying (i was tired, and cab fare is NOT cheap...).  with six restaurants on site at the golden nugget, i thought i could certainly find a suitably \"vegas\" meal right here.  i did, with just a few items to note:  location: i'm staying in the carson tower, and the restaurant is located in the rush tower.  it was a bit of a walk, but i did it just fine in heels, so it's not that far.  i was dining alone and, usually would do that at a bar.  however, after the day of crowds, noise, and bustle, i actually wanted a table to myself.  i was seated at a small table directly adjacent to the back side of the floor-to-ceiling aquarium.  i could not have asked for a better spot, truly.  the water, the activity of the fish- it was all beautifully calming.  the menu here is pretty traditional seafood/steakhouse fare.  i was in the mood for a steak, but knew that there were other possibilities for that later in my stay, so i chose to focus on seafood.  per my usual, i went with a few small plates, instead of a traditional entree.  i ordered the lobster bisque first.  while the flavor was excellent, this is by far the thinnest in texture \"bisque\" i've ever had before.  i'm unsure if that's intentional, or if this  was just a young bisque that didn't have enough time to reduce.  i would order it again, but it's just not what one might expect when you hear the word \"bisque.\"  for my entree, i ordered three items: the crab cake appetizer, and sides of gorgonzola risotto and creamed spinach.  the crab cake was fairly small, for its $16 price tag, but the crab flavor was in the forefront, and the corn & avocado salsa was a nice compliment.  the creamed spinach was truly out of this world.  it was mostly spinach, with just a touch of creaminess.  i didn't even feel badly about eating it, that's how spinach-y it tasted.  the gorgonzola risotto, however, was a major disappointment.  if i was the type of diner who asked for items to be removed from my bill, this would be the meal where i would have pulled that card.  while the risotto was well-cooked, the only discernable flavor was garlic.  there was nothing gorgonzola or bleu cheese about it.  the food was largely good, service was excellent, and the atmosphere was a lovely departure from the usual.  i would definitely eat here again, but it might not be my first choice, with so many other options at my finger tips."}
{"text":"went here on 5/17/11 at 5:00 for happy hour...great drinks, great prices($5) bar menu was equally great $4-6 and a good selection shrimp was tasty and the hummus trio was ok. small fish portions but well cooked and seasoned wasabi mashed ...meh. wife had chicken romano and liked that as well. very good meal and great service but a bit pricey...welll it is scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Some people come to enjoy their huge aquarium. We came to escape the Downtown madness...oh, and the food!  I frequented the Chart House on Oahu many times. I had fond memories of their happy hour, great view, and amazing food. I did learn that many of them are now Landry's, including the one here in Vegas. However, upon viewing the menu, I was happy to see it was similar to the Chart House menu I remember.   I was very happy to have included a meal here during my Downtown staycation for Valentine's weekend this year. Here's what our table had to eat, devoured is more like it!  Kim Chee Calamari Spanish Blues Mussels Filet Mignon Lobster Tail Tour de Shrimp Chocolate Lava Cake. Ordered. Got full. Vowed to attempt next visit!  The food was great. Kim Chee Calamari was recommended to us, it's very different than your typical calamari appetizer, but delicious! I would probably pass on the mussels, it was prepared well but nothing spectacular. My boyfriend enjoyed his perfectly cooked filet, but noted that the 4oz lobster tail add-on wasn't worth the price. My favorite shrimp preparation for my Tour de Shrimp entree was with the cedar plank chimichurri. As you can imagine, this was a classic case of \"Your eyes are bigger than your stomachs.\" We had pre-ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake (takes about 30mins), however, we didn't come close to having room for it. Leaving with our doggy-bags, we promised to return for dessert another night!  I'd have to say that Chart House is more casual than I anticipated. I wouldn't choose it for a romantic night, I'm not sure if it's kid-friendly, but definitely a great choice for dinner with friends and family.   Last but not least, we had the pleasure of having one of the best servers ever, Valerie. She was amazing! She made great menu recommendations, timely and efficient, great personality, and at the same time, let us have our evening without hovering the table. We didn't think our entrees took a long time to arrive, but she said it had been delayed in the kitchen. The manager came by to apologize for the wait, and Valerie still checked up on us. As we apologized for cancelling our dessert, she was quick to say it was no problem and effortlessly sold it to her other table. We will definitely request Valerie for our next dinner there!  Chart House, you fed us well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful aquarium setting...  This place has an incredible fish tank filled with so many colorful & interesting characters! I love that you can watch them and even sit up close to all the action!  The food had some serious misses and this place is pricey. The shrimp cocktail was ok but the high price reflected much larger shrimp. The short ribs weren't as tender as they should be and were accompanied by dry & tasteless mashed potatoes. The lobster grilled cheese sandwich was ok but the lobster bisque it came with was too salty. Overall it was a disappointing meal and the $75 lunch tag didn't make it any better. We also ordered 2 cocktails that were good but I wasn't impressed with the mediocre food. I have no desire to come back and gamble on better tasting dishes however I would come back for the bar and simply order drinks and watch the fish swim by."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the golden nugget and centered around a large 52,000 gallon fish tank which is great to look at while you're enjoying your food. We had the coconut shrimp and hummus for an appetizer. The hummus comes with three kinds and both pita bread and plantains for dipping. I recommend the ahi or fish of the day. The fish tacos were huge and good, but not great. The rustic pear tart for dessert was amazing."}
{"text":"AVOID!  AVOID!  AVOID!  Where do I start?  Yes, I read the Yelp reviews.  Yes, they were bad.  So bad that a sane person would have avoided this poor excuse for a seafood restaurant (but I went anyway...MISTAKE). Most of the poor reviews were due to sub-standard service.  My experience?  The service was HORRIFICALLY bad.  Waited unreasonably long for drink order to be taken.  Waited unreasonably long for drinks to arrive.  Was able to sneak in an appetizer order for calamari when drinks finally arrived.  Waited unreasonably long for calamari to arrive.  Surprised?  Calamari was fair at best.  When the appetizer arrive I finally placed the dinner order.  I ordered the prime rib...rare.  My dinner guest ordered some type of fish.  Guess what took unreasonably long?  Yes, the dinner orders.  As a matter of fact, after waiting unreasonably long for dinner to arrive, someone came to the table to let me know they ran out of rare cuts of prime rib, but they could do medium rare.  So I said that would be fine.  What they brought literally looked like over-cooked pot roast.  It was beyond well-done...it was dry.  The fish that my guest ordered was tough and fishy (smelling and tasting). This place has become a joke.  Do yourself a favor and AVOID the disappointment.  If you're up for seafood stick to the Mastro's restaurants.  They've got a recipe for success and always please."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner our last night in Vegas. Our server, Lori, took time to tell us about the awesome aquarium & fish while dining. My husband and I both had the filet and it was done perfectly. We enjoyed our night!"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here because I haven't been there in several years. It was very good all the way around the last time I ate here. We got right in to the table of choice, waiter was great, staff was great. Sat down ordered drinks and coconut shrimp apps. The shrimp was amazing..... then the filets came out ordered medium rare, but where we'll done, dry, flavorless. My girlfriends baked potatoe was cold, my mashed potatoes warm and very ordinary. Once we received our meal we didn't see the waiter for 30 mins...... we over heard the two tables around us complain about their meal. Restaraunt, view and staff where good, the food was far less than expected for the price. We could have went somewhere else and eaten a far better meal for 1/3 the price. Will not go back and will not recommend the Chart house to anyone."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I recently went to this restaurant to celebrate our engagement with my parents. The setting was perfect for the occasion with the restaurant overlooking the water, and the ambiance overall classic and upscale. Our server was fantastic and did not rush us through dinner at all which we greatly appreciated due to the nature of our reason for dining there.   As far as food goes, I had some of THE best prime rib I have ever tasted. Meat was cooked to perfection (I prefer medium), and flavor was outstanding. We had the coconut shrimp as well as the hummus appetizers. Both delicious!   I could not give this restaurant 5stars due to my salad, and the dessert. I should have done the salad bar which looked amazing. My dad loaded his plate up, and said all items were fresh and tasted great. My chopped salad had good flavors but seemed a little wilted. I didn't finish it.. Additionally, the lava cake for dessert was a little dry.   Overall a great experience, and I will go back!   Thank you for helping us celebrate our special news!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was fantastic! We went with a group of 9 and everyone loved their meals. From fish, to steak, to lamb, everything was very good. Our waiter, Harris, was excellent. He was friendly and his recommendations were on point."}
{"text":"We had dinner at the Chart House before going to the Smith Center to see Book of Mormon. I was really hungry so I ordered a shrimp cocktail as an appetizer the ahi tuna as my main course. My wife what is the same thing she shared it with one of my friends had basically half of what I ate. Shrimp cocktail came. It consisted of the five biggest shrimp I've ever seen in a shrimp cocktail. It was a beautiful presentation. This probably would have been enough my entire dinner. Needless to say I ate it all giving only one of the shrimp to one of my friends. The shrimp cocktail was a big hit for everyone who ate it. The ahi tuna came next. It was a huge portion of the ahi tuna. It was cooked to perfection just as I ordered, seared on the outside and nearly raw on the inside. It was absolutely scrumptious. It cut it with a fork and melted in the mouth. The two pieces of ahi came over a bed of wasabi mashed potatoes. These look great and a perfect complement to the meal. My wife ordered green beans instead of mashed potatoes. These were also especially yummy. Unfortunately no one had any room for dessert. I will be going back to the Chart House the next time I have tickets for the Smith Center."}
{"text":"Dinner at Chart House tonight Poor service. Drink bad had to send back Vegetables not cooked sent back $9.50 per person for salad bar with meal!!!! Manager not particularly concerned Will not return"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Located in the Golden Nugget, the ambience is beautiful. We got the clam chowder, tour de shrimp and fish and it was all immaculate. (Especially that shrimp, all 3 types were delicious!). Chocolate lava dessert was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. Can't wait to come back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"The seafood was decent.  I honestly expected more since this is Vegas.  I've had better scallops at restaurants like Pappadeaux and Anthony's Homeport.  I was really impressed with the wasabi mashed potatoes though.  Awesome side dish.  Wasabi pretty much goes with everything.  Very cool ambience here.  Would be a good place to take your girl.  The moray eel looked awesome."}
{"text":"Feb 12, 2018, 6:00 p.m. The Quality of the food was not worth the Price.  The food was good, but at these prices it should be exceptional. The service however was exemplary.  We stuck to the fish dishes as that was their specialty. Overall pretty well done, but their Ahi Tuna plate could use some work. The fish was too warm, it should be seared on the outside and cold on the inside. The sauces served with it were very bland, even the Wasabi sauce had no zing. One of our party had the Prime Rib, it was stringy, under done. He could only eat about half of it, the rest was trim. Another had the deep fried seafood combo plate. Greasy and over cooked. Other two mains were okay, but not spectacular. The Creme Brule for dessert was their best dish by far.  At an average of $40 per entree, not cheap and I am convinced the quality of the food does not warrant the prices they charge.  The service was exemplary. Someone spent a lot of time training the staff to provide top notch European type service."}
{"text":"Some friends and I were in town for CosmoProf, the largest convention in the beauty industry. Let me start off by saying our service was wonderful. Our waiter was a nice man (I am completely blanking on his name right now but will update this review if any of my friends remember) who was very catering to myself, my husband, our little one and another couple (5 dinners in total).  We loved the ambiance. The aquarium is quite impressive and left my 5 month old son something very interactive to stare at. The restaurant itself isn't too large but very open while still portraying a modern feel. We started with a calamari appetizer, 3 mojitos and a glass of Malbec. The Calamari was cooked to perfection and had a nice crunch to it.  The mojitos were delish and the Malbec hit the spot. We wanted to really enjoy our evening so next we ordered some soups and salads and another round of drinks. The Clam Chowder was nice, it wasn't too salty and had a smooth texture. The Brie and Berry Salad was divine. It had just the right balance of acidity along with very tasty candied pistachios. The Roasted Beet Salad was also delish! The vinaigrette wasn't too overpowering letting all the ingredients in the salad still stand out. We then ordered Swordfish, Shrimp Pasta, Filet Mignon and Prime Rib. Now here comes the 2 star part, and it's not because the entrees were horrible but the whole ordeal in what it took to even getting our entrees.  HERE GOES: About 20 minutes after we placed our entree orders our server came up to us and told us they were \"out of mashed potatoes\" We of coarse were shocked, like what do you mean you're out of mashed potatoes, half our party ordered them to go with their steaks. He then continued to offer us a rice instead....that's a no, I mean C'mon it's steak. Then he comes back and tells us \"wait!.... I can have the mashed potatoes ready in 45 minutes\".  What is this??? POTATOEGATE?? First the potatoes are there, then they are out, then they can be ready in 45 minutes??? We agree to wait (over an hour at this point) and simply ask that we receive a free lava cake in compensation for our time. We are a reasonable bunch and understand that miscommunication happens. Well almost an hour goes by and finally our long awaited entrees arrive, they were all tasty except for one little thing. OUR MASHED POTATOES WERE COLD. Which was extremely surprising since we waited almost an hour for them. Clearly they were frozen and just thawed to the plate. We then asked to speak to a manager, we told her the ordeal and let her know that our server was not at fault and that he had been extremely kind. She however was very RUDE. It was clear she has not had much experience in the industry and offered us no explanation as to why our food was cold and didn't even offer an apology. I have never seen such disregard for the customer. When our lava cake arrived our server let us know that the manager did not approve for it to be comped. Which was an even more telling sign that she simply has no regard for customer experience. Our bill was almost $400 and she couldn't comp a $12 cake. Definitely not the level of service you expect when going to fine dining restaurant.  Overall Vegas has a plethora of fine dining restaurants so there is no need for us to bring our business back here."}
{"text":"Nice classy happy hour from 4-6pm. Good drinks and appetizers!! nice selection, good prices. There were 5 of us.. Amanda handled us very pleasantly and timely. Highly recommend. And ask for Amanda!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely had an amazing experience here... went here to celebrate a birthday and was extremely satisfied with the quality of food and service. Our waitress was a leader in customer service, her name was Lyneet (might be spelled with an extra e or t). She also explained the rewards program and all the benefits it provides people like us who tend to dine out often. The location also provides an amazing happy hour with a variety of options that include wine, beer and specialty drinks (mango mojito is a must try). Cant wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome dinner!  The prime rib was cooked to perfection, the fish tank was awesome, the waiter was fantastic.  Will do again."}
{"text":"The food...delicious. The atmosphere...relaxing. The service...pretty spot-on. The pricing...ehhh, not my thing here. The only way I was able to eat here was because a family friend treated my family out. But if you're looking to spoil yourself or anyone you know, with food, this is the place to do it.   I ordered the Chicken Romano (pan-seared with a blend of romano cheese & panko breadcrumbs, with lemon shallot butter, tomatoes, asparagus & yukon gold mashed potatoes). The chicken pan-seared with bread crumbs was great to eat, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.The asparagus... I've had better, but the yukon gold mashed potatoes were silky, buttery and made perfectly. They went well with the chicken romano.  My dad ordered the NY Strip, and they were kind of enough to cut it up for him since he was handicapped. They checked up on us frequently. THE ONLY THING I WOULD COMPLAIN ABOUT WAS THEY ACTUALLY CAME UP AND ASKED IF I WAS DONE (ALREADY GRABBING AT MY PLATE) WHEN THE FORK WAS STILL IN MY MOUTH BECAUSE APPARENTLY I WAS STILL EATING. Since that ruined my entire experience thus far, I just told them to take it.  In addition, the entire table got an order of the unlimited salad bar. The salad bar was great, but nothing like the choices offered at Souplantation. Also, because I ate the salad beforehand, I wasn't able to finish off the main entree I ordered.   Will I be back? Probably not."}
{"text":"My husband had the lamb shank and he was blown away by how good it was. I had the seafood trio and it was delicious except the crab cake was a little disappointing. It wasn't gross, I've just had much better crab cakes before.  The salmon and shrimp scampi was delicious. The scampi was by far my favorite part of the trio. The hot chocolate lava cake was amazing and service was excellent. I'm giving 4/5 because of my crab cake and I got a little motion sick sitting against the fish tank."}
{"text":"Contacted their corporate office via their web page.  Someone sent a messsage to me on this site asking I do that, which I replied I already have done that.  No response from that person.  Received a phone call from a manager in New Jersey, who apologized for the confusion.  Said someone would call me.  It has been a month and they have not.  Recontacted the corporate office a week ago, and still no answer.  For a $125 dinner I really expect more.  They errored and refuse to even acknowledge it.  I want my money back now.  So frustrating.  They are able to send me emails about every week telling me their most recent specials though."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and scenery. Thanks to my brother in law for inviting us for dinner."}
{"text":"Absouley loved this place, great food, great drinks and great atmosphere.  My steak was cooked to perfection. I will eat here again and will recommend this place to all friends and family. What great scenery not to mention the location of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Wonderful service and atmosphere. My food was outstanding. I can't recall a better meal.  Lobster Bisque, prime Rib, creamed spinach, bacon spatzel.   Perfection!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Autumn salad good Roasted beet salad very good Prime rib decent Scallops good Crab cakes good Cool aquarium in the restaurant  Good service. Remember to get validated for parking"}
{"text":"Had the real deal Chilean Sea Bass served perfectly for a late lunch. Really a fine dining experience hidden in checkin area of Golden Nugget. Pricing was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Pricey restaurant with fancy food options.  Coming here, despite being located in downtown Las Vegas, you end up paying prices seen on The Strip. That being said, they definitely price and shape their dishes and sides to encourage \"3 dollar sign\" or over food bills. I've had expensive filet minion elsewhere and was given good veggie and carb choices included in the meals whereas here you'll have to get your own veggies. My young hen dish, although on the cheaper side, came with meager veggie sides (burn and shriveled) and two sad little potatoes. Then hen was also basically four small, if at least flavorful, roasted leg pieces.  Ok ignoring the overpriced food, they do have a large menu selection and also seem to specialize in cooked seafood dishes. And I must say their service is exceptional as the staff works tirelessly to make sure you are taken care of.  Despite being disappointed with my food quantities, the flavors of the main dish was there and the potato mash and crab cake sides were good. That and the huge soufflé option made the meal interesting and deserving of 3 stars. Honestly I would go elsewhere and spend money to get the most out of it.  To be fair, I'll mention that their seafood platter is huge and you definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Food = AMAZING  Service = Meh.  We went here last week to celebrate a dual special occasion. We ordered pricey champagne, and it arrived 35 minutes later - no ice bucket - and was served with margarita goblets. We were told with no apology they \"ran out.\" Well, that sucks.   Honestly, the food was incredible, I was annoyed by the service, but it probably was a fluke, so I'd go back. Maybe."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in the food and the service.  I have been to other locations and they were really good.  I had a shrimp trio and the shrimp were very small and lacked flavor.  The asparagus had huge trunks and were very hard.  The service was mediocre, we were a party of 6 and all felt the same about the food and drink.  Scratching this place off our list."}
{"text":"My heart sank when I walked in and saw the gorgeous view because, with a few rare exceptions, restaurants with great views often have \"meh\" food because they can count on ambiance for business.   It sank further when I saw the Ponderosa-style salad bar.  Call me a foodie snob but a salad bar is a bad sign much like book-thick menus with pictures.    We sat at the bar with the intent of having a drink before our reservation but the bartender never got to us.    Once seated, my husband ordered a brown derby.  He received a drink that was tasty but it was not, in any way, a brown derby.    My spicy cucumber drink was bland, boring and lacked complexity.  I ordered the tuna and while the tuna was actually decent quality, the preparation was a snooze (shallot butter should have had more flavor).  My mixed vegetables were unevenly cooked - some were mushy, others were raw.    Skip it.  Go to McCormick-Stillman Park for the view and pay Old Town prices at a restaurant with good food."}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible food and horribly overpriced!  Truly the worst king crab legs, salmon and side items I have ever experienced.  Do not try to change anything, they will act like you are evil and treat you awful.  It was my birthday dinner and they did not even offer a dessert item!  The manager was terrible also along with the server Red Lobster is far superior in both service and food quality for 1/2 to 1/3 the cost.  It is sad because the Golden Nugget is awesome and Vic and Anthony's is amazingly great food and service!  Wayne Gorsek"}
{"text":"Went to Chart House on a Friday evening at 7:30.  They were not busy at all.  You'd think that we would get quick service as they were not busy - no way..... the waiter was pleasant, the salad bar pretty good, the view was nice, the food - just ok.  The food coming out of the kitchen was s l o w. Really not worth going back to when there are so many other worthy restaurants."}
{"text":"Chart House was excellent! My fiance and I went there to celebrate our proposal and had a great time. I had the prime rib and my fiance had the filet and both were excellent. It is a bit expensive, but the atmosphere and the view was worth it. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice dinner at the Chart House in the Golden Nugget.  The view of the Aquarium is awesome.  The service was superb.  I had the Sea Bass and it was very tasty.  They had menus made specific for my birthday that they later rolled up for me to take home.  Great place to dine!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely not the type of person who likes to give merely 1 star... but after my experience here, it's hard to give it anything more.  The only thing going for it really was the view... too bad though that it was too dark to see the water.  We went here for my birthday dinner a few nights ago.  Walked in, nice decor, but were greeted by the smirk of a man who was looking down his nose at us - especially since we didn't have a reservation.  The place wasn't busy... maybe half full, if that.  We waited patiently for about 20 minutes to be seated.  The waitress was... somewhat polite; I mean, she did try to cater her suggestions to her audience.  I'm Japanese, but you know... just because I am doesn't mean that you need to suggest all the Asian dishes as specialties.  She did the same racial profiling to the table next to us of Italians.  While I understand her meaning behind it and I'm sure she didn't mean to be offensive, I just found it odd.  Unfortunately, she also didn't know anything at all about the wines, but I made a selection we enjoyed anyhow.   We ordered the calamari as the app and it came out cold.  I personally have never enjoyed cold fried items, but hey that's me.  I'm not all that sure how long it had been sitting in the window, but since it took about 30 minutes to arrive at the table I assume a while.  The whole night it felt as though our waitress was avoiding us since the calamari sat nearly untouched for at least 15 minutes until she came by with my friend's clam chowder soup.  The soup he said was good, but I found it slightly inexcusable that she kept walking past our table and looking at the untouched appetizer whilst she continued to service the table next to us to her fullest extent. For our entrees, he ordered shrimp 3 ways and I ordered a simple shrimp and crab pasta.  His was overcooked to the point of rubber and mine made me feel ill immediately after consumption.  We both decided to skip out on desserts due to the awful service and poor food quality.    One thing that upsets me is when a restaurant ruins its ingredients and this one did.  Go for the soup and nothing else.  If you expect even a smidgen of decent service, don't even bother. It's over priced and pretentious for food that is improperly prepared.  Before exiting the establishment I had to excuse myself in order to \"go bulimic\" and my friend felt incredibly sick the next day.  Stomachs beware!"}
{"text":"Being a person who works downtown, this is one of my most favorite places to eat lunch. The entire experience is great from the huge aquarium, to the fresh baked rolls and the food and service are fantastic. I highly recommend Hayley as a server and Mark the GM is awesome. Favorite dishes are the Kim Chi Calamari and the Lobster Bisque is insane."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for our 2 year anniversary.  We got married at the Mellineum across the lake so we enjoy looking over and remembering what a perfect day our wedding was.  We called to make a reservation for the patio which is where we sat last year for our 1st anniversary, but we're told unless you're a party of 15 or more or have a $1500 f&b minimum that they don't sweat out there currently.   So we ask for a window seat.  Being our anniversary they customize the menu with your name...spelled wrong!  1st.strike.  We both ordered a filet; mine with a lobster tail and his with shrimp. Now any other place I've ever ordered a FILET, it's no less than 2\" thick.  Not tonight. This filet looked more like a cut of tbone steak than a filet.  Furthermore the food was not even warm.  But we don't ever send food back...Not a good choice.  The flavor was great as well as presentation.  Just not crazy about cold lobster tail.  The molten lava cake was amazing and Britani ou server was amazing too.  I almost forgot to mention that their idea of a romantic table for an anniversary was was a longer skinnier table with us sitting next to each other.  I love my husband therefore would rather sit in front of him so I can look at him throughout the evening. For a $200 bill, we will go to Dominicks next time.  Chart  House needs to up their game a bit."}
{"text":"not great for the money.  So, we were comp'd (the waitress did not know this) so we ordered freely.   The service was quite pleasant but the quality of the food was very average.  Specialty cocktails: bloody may (no flavor?) and a their version of a moscow mule (they ran out of proper glassware with apologies - this version was a fruity sweet drink.   The oysters were good.  The orange / avacado salad was killed with red onion (a seasonal special?) and no other flavor in the dressing. The ceasar salad very good.  brick chicken was a dry flat piece of jerky with no seasoning. Her marinated tomahawk lamb chops (again no salt or pepper) overcooked and flavorless.  Finally, decaf coffee absolutely the worst coffee in LV - they didn't offer to take it off the bill (again they had no idea of our comp)  They are now owned by \"the Billion Buyer\" who is a restaurant magnet. So, the wait staff did push the $25 Landry's Club card. We bought figuring the waitress got points for selling it - she was very pleasant.  When in LV I am sure a trip to the bar at happy hour with fried appetizers would have been better.   Based on the previous reviews I suppose your experience will be hit or miss - we were a miss."}
{"text":"It was our anniversary and I wanted to take my wife to Chart House as that was where our first date was in Vail Co. I have eaten at several Chart Houses throughout the country and it was one of my favorite restaurants. Upon entering at our reservation time of 5:00 pm, it was apparent they were not prepared to start serving anyone. We were seated at a 5 top and when we asked if we could get a table by the window, the waiter seemed perplexed. He thought we had 5 in our party and we explained that there was only 2 and the reservation was at 5 pm. Upon seating we were served with our menus that had our names printed on them. Nice touch but it helps to spell the name correctly ! My wife had Salmon which was ok and I had prime rib which was overcooked. We both had the salad bar which is one of the main reasons we love Chart House. We were very disappointed!! No caviar, no Ceaser salad made up and nothing really special about it.  Service was mediocre and we had to flag the waiter down to get our drinks filled. They boxed up the leftovers and we went home feeling very disappointed. When we got home, we realized what they really think about their customers. My prime rib was thrown in a small container with the potatoes thrown on top. There was no Ajus or horseradish sauce so I got to have a dry pie of leftover meat the next evening. My wife's salmon was packaged the same.  Probably the reason the restaurant was fairly empty."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE management team and treatment of repeat customers. My boyfriend and I went in on Christmas Day to eat in the bar area, but after realizing they offered an extremely limited menu, we asked for a table instead. We were told reservations only - understandable on Christmas. Out of curiosity, I checked OpenTable.com and saw that they had a reservation available for 2 in 15 minutes so I booked it. We closed out at the bar, and approached the snarky hostess with our confirmation in hand to be seated. She said that we weren't in her system and refused to seat us so we asked to speak with her manager. The manager, Lori Schleicher (could be misspelling - staff would not spell it for me) came to speak with us and immediately had a horrible attitude, treated us with disdain, and said that we had \"gotten a table in a roundabout way\" so we would not be served that evening. (WHAT?! Booking a table online is wrong??) She was incredibly curt and unapologetic, so we asked to speak with her manager. The gentleman who introduced himself as the Managing Director, Johnny Barnett, was not much better. He said that he understood there was a problem since we'd gotten a reservation while we were in the building and therefore would not honor our reservation. I stated that there was no provision on the website for a person's location or any requirements for the timing of when a reservation was made. We'd been allowed to reserve a table and should not be penalized for that if it wasn't supposed to be able to happen. He said that clearly someone had cancelled their reservation, which is why we were allowed to book, and when I pointed out that this indicates they have the capacity to serve us, he said that they overbook their reservations and count on people to cancel to get by. Unacceptable. NOT ONCE did they apologize or treat us with respect. We're repeat customers and have sent several friends and family their way. NEVER AGAIN. TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, THEY MARKED US AS NO SHOWS ON OPENTABLE AFTER REPEATEDLY INSISTING THAT OUR RESERVATION WAS NOT IN THEIR SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. This prompted for me to get an email from OpenTable chastising me for not showing up when they were the ones that would not allow us to be seated. Ugh! Given the level that this establishment pretends to operate at, which is evident in their pricing, I would expect much, much better treatment and service. SAVE YOUR EVENING AND GO SPEND YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE!"}
{"text":"Just like the other Chart House restaurants, the food is fresh and made to order plus  atmosphere really can't be beat.  If you want to see the most amazing fish tank you've ever seen, this is the place.  Even though it is an open restaurant in the Golden Nugget, the noise level isn't noticeable."}
{"text":"This place understands customer service! Holy cow this place is amazing! I cannot say enough good things about this place!  We came here one night on my golden birthday celebration weekend in Las Vegas. This place is amazing. My wife and I love seafood, so this was a no brainer when we were looking for places to eat in downtown Las Vegas. Although it was pricey, it had won some cool awards and the atmosphere drew us in (who can resist a HUGE fish tank in the middle of the place??).  We got lucky and scored a table right next to the fish tank. Our waiter was super, super friendly and cordial. The restaurant had printed out custom menus for the two of us for my birthday (we had made reservations beforehand). I ordered the Tour De Shrimp and my wife ordered the Coconut Shrimp. We also ordered a crab cake for an appetizer and a few drinks. The crab cake was amazing, full of fresh shelled crab no doubt. Our food was simply amazing tasting and looking. Every detail was of the highest quality. Not only did the food taste delicious, it looked delicious too.   At the end of the meal, our waiter brought out a complimentary dessert and card signed by the chefs for my birthday. I don't think I have ever been treated so well at any other restaurant. Nice finishing touch to a wonderful meal.  Yes, the food is pricey. But this is one of those rare times that I can literally say it was worth every single dollar spent.   *Also make sure to make reservations here. Since this place is so good, it is very popular and fills up very fast during dinner time."}
{"text":"Way over priced for what you get.  Fish was small portion and dry.  Had Halibut and Salmon dishes.  Service was good, but took forever to get your food.  Not very crowded either.  The location of this restaurant is behind the check in desk making it feel like you aren't really in a choice position to drop 100 bucks on dinner for two without wine!  I would NEVER eat here again. Dry bread and crackers w/ whipped butter.  And,  40 dollars for a small piece of halibut 1/2 thick...w 15 string beans...come on....!!! Salmon was good, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Normally I love this place. It WAS my favorite restaurant downtown, but the only thing that is worse than bad service in a restaurant, is bad service management.   The meal almost started good. We had to wait a while to order, but maybe there was an issue.   After we were able to order, the server kept talking over me, but we were able to order our appetizer: oysters.   Then the entrees: here's where service and managerial failures collide. I ordered the wok fried fish- I got baked fish (which was caught by another server who was great- seriously we may have had the one bad server in the room). We were going to a show, so we didn't have time for another entree, plus they ruined the last fish anyway.   Then the manager came over and gave the obligatory apology. It would've been ok at Applebee's, but come on, it's a fine dining restaurant.   Ordered dessert which was supposed to be \"lemon cucumber ice cream\". Unfortunately, the server forgot to mention the heavy amount of basil, so it was inedible.   I tried to stay positive, but everything just added up.   I went to talk to the manager, because $170 is a lot  to spend on some oysters and a crab cake.   She didn't care. She gave another fake apology and said, \" I wasn't aware of the other issues.\" I didn't realize there was a number of issues that had to happen before a manager did anything. I just figured that if I went out to dinner, I'd actually get to eat dinner.   Now I can't go back, because of this.   But it's vegas, and I can have great seafood anywhere.   And at other fine dining places, the managers understand service."}
{"text":"The chocolate lava cake alone gets this place 4 stars. You place your order for it at the beginning of you meal because it takes quite some time to bake.   There is a cute little lake/pond that you can get a window seat next to and watch the ducks.   They print out their menu daily (maybe twice a day, I can't remember). My boyfriend loves the fillet here and I've had the sea bass and it was delicious. They also have a very nice salad bar where you can add your own ingredients to the salad and try some of their cold pastas. Our waiter was very attentive and made some great wine suggestions.   This place has an upscale atmosphere to it even though most people dress in resort casual wear. It would be a nice place to go for a romantic dinner.   *Sign up for their dining program. You get one point for every dollar you spend (not including taxes and tip) and my boyfriend said they accumulate toward free gift certificates."}
{"text":"I have dined at just about every restaurant in Las Vegas and i can say wit confidence that this is one of the best. The combination of food quality, atmosphere and especially service is unbelievable. My girlfriend stated to our server (James ) that she has some food allergies and he immediately started taking notes of everything she said, He then leaned in and said \"we take food allergies very seriously here, i will bring out the chef to ensure that there are no issues\" It felt really nice for someone to finally understand. Food was incredible and we were seated right next to the tank per my request. At the end of my meal, James brought over a card that he personally wrote to wish us a happy anniversary.  I look forward to my return,"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. I went here with hubby for date night and had a fabulous dinner. He had the grilled Chilean sea bass and I had the autumn salad with fig and blue cheese. Fresh and savory ingredients. They also have nice wine selection and cocktail menu. As locals, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the m9st hostess, best server, great food, in front of the most unbelievable fish tank. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The food was great. The service was impeccable. The aquarium in the center of the restaurant is amazing."}
{"text":"Do not go here.  I've been going to the Chart House ever since I was a kid in New Port beach CA.  So I decided to take my girlfriend to the Las Vegas location for our 3 year anniversary.  $150 later the Mahi Mahi was dry, the filet mignon was bland, our appetizer was cold and they don't even have their signature salad bar.  To make matters worst we ordered their famous lava cake 30 min prior as recommended and when it was time for dessert the waitress came and told us the chef forgot to put the lava in the cake.  No joke!!!  What's makes things more frustrating is the fact the I mentioned all this to the waitress and nothing was done to make our visit any better.  Not even a free drink.  Very disappointed in the Chart House in downtown Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. Has a Huge fish tank in the restaurant. We ordered the chopped salad for our appetizer which was delicious. we also Ordered the Cheese plate which was ok. The complementary bread is delicious.   Our entrees included: shrimp scampi, filet with blue cheese, normal filets, halibut blackened, prime rib, side of asparagus, and green beans. Everything was really good. The prime rib was a little salty however still tasted really good. Also some of the green beans were a bit too hard.   For dessert we had the mud pie and the chocolate molten cake! Both were phenomenal. You have to order the molten cake when you Order your entree, since it takes them a while to make it. It was really really good!   The waiter was very nice. the manager Also came Over to check if everything was going well. Great place."}
{"text":"Just had a quicky dinner here and everything we ordered was delish! The stone crab claws, the ménage soup, the surf n turf, the shrimp scampi and lastly the chocolate lava cake.  The service was efficient  and fast ( not complaining at all)!!   We had just arrived from Kauai and pretty much just needed to eat and run! Since we are staying at the GN we will definitely be back!!!! And probably have a more leisurely meal!!"}
{"text":"We loved the East meets West appetizer and the swordfish! Great service too!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night and the food was excellent.   It's not cheap, but my Filet was so tender that I could cut it with my fork.  We none felt cheated and highly recommend that if you come to Vegas give the restaurant a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We celebrated our birthday dinner and had an amazing time.  It was our first time here n definitely won't be the last.  The attention from the staff and the service were genuine and outstanding!!  They personalized the menu with a birthday message for me.  The staff also signed a birthday card!  Super sweet ! Great job on making an old girl feel special.   We ordered the whole red snapper and the signature Mac n cheese block.  Excellent food!! If you haven't tried them please do so."}
{"text":"This place is a great place for an awesome seafood dinner for a special occasion.  Our server was attentive, our appetizers came out in great time and we're delicious.  I wish we would have got seated near the window since the place wasn't full at all, but oh well.  Also, the sauce in the shrimp linguine dish tasted like it had half a bottle of wine poured into it.  I certainly didn't mind but someone whom doesn't like a heavy wine sauce wouldn't be too happy.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A quaint seafood restaurant located in the Golden Nugget. Upon approach the entry is bit confusing and uninviting. The hostess stand is more just the end peice of the bar, which would make sense because to your left is the lounge seating area and to the right is seating for the actual bar.  As for ambiance and decor, there is a large aquarium in the center of the restaurant which is filled with beautiful fish. Creates an illustrious allure.  At first we were a bit taken back we were brought to a table that was in the middle of the bar/lounge area. We asked to be reseated in the main dinning room. We were really sure why we would be seated in the noisy bar that was filled with groups of people just drinking vs the actual dining room since we were there for dinner. Nonetheless, that was a bit of a upsetting start.  After being sat at our table, someone offered us water but spilled it on the table and never wiped it up. We ended up wiping it up ourselves. We were greeted and welcomed by our server and offered cocktails. We tried the infused dill drink. Presentation was unique and new. The drink itself was good, not too strong and a great pre-dinner drink.   We started with the oysters. First thought, they were huge. Unfortunately, not the tastiest. They weren't amongst the freshest and required extra lemons to be squeezed over them. Next we had the lobster bisque and chopped salad. The bisque was good only thing is it wasn't very warm upon being served, more like room temp so that was a bit disappointing. Chopped salad on the other hand was crazy good!  Side note: they had this brown bread (forgot the name) that was Delicious!!   As we moved onto our entree we ordered a bottle of Paraduxx wine. One of my absolute favorite wines. I ordered the lamb chops with fingerling vegetables and a side of creamed spinach. The lamb chops were prepared medium rare. Probably one of the best lamb chops I have had. The sauce served over it was a little strong however it didn't take away from the meal itself.   I love creamed spinach and always get it when I see it on the menu so I had to have it. They serve it with crushed bread crumbs over it, different.   Food overall was acceptable. It is a pretty average menu restaurant with no real special items or distinct flavors. For the price I feel there are other seafood restaurants  that are much more worth it.   So why 4 stars, simple...our server Julie was amazing! Seriously if it wasn't for her I probably would have given 2 or 3 stars. Julie was all smiles from start to finish. She had quality suggestions, was extremely pleasant and best of all she connected with us throughout our dining experience. We had a couple small 30 second chats here and there which left us forgetting about our unsatisfactory moments.   I love trying new places, living in Las Vegas there are tons of spots to try and I'm always up for new experiences. If we ever come back I'm definitely going to ask for Julie."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding dining experience!  The gorgeous decor and ambiance are matched only by the top notch service!  The location: located inside The Golden Nugget hotel right off of Fremont Street this elegant location is a welcome surprise tucked in the corner away from cigarettes and noise. Beautiful floral arrangements offset the AMAZING fish tank that has a serious *wow* factor. Candle light, nice flatware.  Drinks: I had the tastiest mango mojito in Las Vegas,  sweet and minty, light ice, refreshing. My husband said the IPA was *nutty* and bold.  I ordered the seafood platter. Outstanding,tempura tilapia, shrimp, lobster, grilled scallops with skinny fries and plantain chips, served three sauces, a sweet chili, cocktail and tartar.  My husband had the steak, perfectly prepared medium rare,  fully loaded potatoes w/bacon, cheese, butter, sour cream, scallions and a side of veggies.  The girls both had the shrimp tempura with fries they gobbled up happily before we could get a sample! Shirley Temples, extra cherries.   The dessert was a DESSERT!!! It states on the menu that each chocolate molten lava cake is prepared individually and that you must allow 30 minutes for your order. Great decision to order before dinner, large cake served with hand churned peanut butter chocolate iced cream drizzled with fudge.  Oh yeah,  we will be back! Five star service, no holes to speak of.  Thanks Chart House, faith in restaurant excellence,  restored."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot for lunch, which is a good deal.  I've never been to this location for dinner until last night.  It definitely gets more crowded for lunch than dinner.  The food is excellent.  We had the pan seared scallops ($29) and the seared chilean sea bass ($38) which were both very tasty.  Also the sizzling mushrooms as a side ($8), which were also very good.  I love mushrooms.  The best part was the shrimp cocktail ($15) which comes with dry ice!  Really cool effect.   The service was very attentive but I got the constant \"upsell\" vibe from our server.  She kept pushing certain products and wanted us to join the frequent diner club.  I know this place is a chain but they need to let their server lay off and be themselves.  The fish tank is really cool and makes for good conversation.  If it seems to pricey for dinner, check it out for lunch where the prices are less and the portion sizes are about the same."}
{"text":"I went there with friends from work and the food was great.   The service was top notch,  Jarrod waited I  our table.   He was pleasant, entertaining and knowledgeable.   If price is not an option then this is a great choice. The quality of the food is very good and as the photos show the presentation was excellent.   There were 8 of us and we all had plenty to eat.  Some left with leftovers.   I will say we did order a lot.   We had 8 appetizers,  The main course and 4 desserts that we shared.   Since work paid the bill,  I would have to guess that the average bill for a couple would cost around $150 with drinks.   I will say the service made it very pleasant,  I know I spoke of that already, but good service makes a world of difference.    Only one thing that I feel should be changed,  in a place of this level having tv's playing the spring events was or off place and detracted from the ambience."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere!  We started our weekend Las Vegas trip with a fabulous dinner at Chart House, inside the Golden Nugget Casino in Downtown Las Vegas. We made reservations, so there was no wait and we were seated quickly.   We were seated at a very comfortable table near a television, which was important as the LA Clippers were playing. The restaurant is simply gorgeous, with a massive aquarium in the center of the restaurant, and everyone gets a great view of the marine life.   Our party of 5 ordered several different appetizers to share: Crispy Coconut Shrimp, Cold Shrimp and Lobster Egg Rolls, and Fish Tacos, all of which were excellent. The group went through quite a bit of wine and liquor, and although I don't typically drink, I certainly enjoyed the Fleur de Lis on the cocktail menu!  I had the Chilean Sea Bass, a first for me, and it was delectable. Tender, flaky and the port wine sauce was stellar. Everyone in the group was very pleased with the quality and taste of the food.   If there was ONE negative thing to say about the Chart House, it was the Souffle. Very, very boring and unimpressive. Tasted like egg whites, and that's it. But aside from that, we had nothing else to complain about!  We had never been to the Chart House before, but I can assure you it will NOT be our last visit. Well worth every penny!"}
{"text":"We Enjoyed the Charthouse the first time i came to this location a while back on my trip to Vegas. I love the big giant fish tank and the spacy flooers to enter and exit inside and out into the casinos in all of frreemont. Food is always great, and the crowd gets big, but i still love my favorite Location of the Charthouse in Redondo Beach California overlooking the ocean and boats. Always a pleasure to try a different atmosphere."}
{"text":"Judging by the negative reviews, it appears Chart house is NOT what it used to be. We seem to have all the same complaints and Chart House has not responded to anybody NOR fixed its on going problems. My review will not matter or count because clearly Chart House does not care about reviews, hence their crappy customer service. Nevertheless, here it is. It has been about 6 years since I last visited The Chart House. I decided that this is where I'd like to return for Valentines Day 2018.  Plus, my husband has never been there. Since V-day falls during the week, we decided to celebrate on a weekend instead. I called and booked 2 WEEKS in advance, making sure we get in! It was a good thing we waited to celebrate because I ended up having the flu on Valentines Day.  Nevertheless, when I called to make reservations, the guy who answered didn't sound professional nor confident in what he was doing. I had peeked at the open table website to make sure the available times he gave me matched the website. 7:00 was the earliest they had available. We took it! 2 weeks later my husband and I got all dressed up and ready for our lovely dinner.  We were also hoping to request a window seat upon arrival. We get to the hostess station where a younger girl with long dark hair proceeds to tell me we have no reservation! Then, with a little help from her colleague she then tells us we were counted as a NO show because our reservations were at 5:45. I told her there was a mistake on their end and 5:45 was not even an option at the time I called. All she kept saying was sorry and there's nothing they can do. She suggested for us to sit at the bar, elbow to elbow with others, or we can wait until 9pm for the next available seat! I told her that is not an option and why should we have to pay for someone else's screw up? I was saving my appetite and had not eaten since 12:00 that day....there was NO way I was waiting until 9:00pm. She pretty much gave us the stank eye and sent us on our way. We ended up waiting for a small bar table in the bar area to open up.  I felt like a vulture stalking these poor people for their table lol. We literally stood there waiting for people to leave. This is something that the restaurant could have done for us at the least, instead of letting us flounder around.  Within 10 minutes a bar table opened up and we snagged it. At this point, I was already mad and didn't even want to be there. Unfortunately, all other restaurants near by were booked until 9pm as well.  To add insult to injury, the table was under my chin! I could have used a booster seat, since they only cater to tall people. As for the food....I got the shrimp and scallops, and it was about as ordinary as it comes. Nothing to shake a stick at! They had 1 bar tender for entire place, and yes it took awhile to get a drink. Our waiter was nice and tried to polish this tu** of a place the best he could. The place needs different management ASAP. They have NO structure, lack customer service skills, and have a bunch of lazy amateurs at the front desk who don't know how to push a button to make a reservation. Mark my words....this place doesn't have long before they close! It has all the signs."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great seating right by the fish tank. Great service food is excellent it's a must stop if you stay here."}
{"text":"Such a great dinner here! We sat next to the huuuge aquarium, and ate our selves silly. Awesome fried mac and cheese, and our fish were cooked perfectly! Great decor and ambiance, and it's a nice swanky spot near the Fremont Street Experience."}
{"text":"Great experience  dining here. From the moment my date and I walked in, I was greeted and treated like royalty. They catered to every need and attempted to find a great window seat indoors. As they checked we sat at the elegant bar they have there and had a drink while we waited a short 3 minutes or so. When the hostess came back we were presented with two options!!  A seat near a window with a lake view or a table outside above the lake (which we chose) which was very nice, romantic and private as we ended up being the only guests outside on their outdoor seating.   The food was great! We ordered a mixed scallops dish, lobster tail, lobster bisque, oysters and  asparagus - we finished every bit of it.   Chart house has a great selection of red wine specifically and the wine bottle we didn't finished - they allowed us to cork it and take it home with us as we had other alcoholic beverages we had ordered and felt tipsy enough with.  The waiter was very attentive , but did tend to talk an extended time when he would do so.... I think he liked the eye candy I had with me ;)  All in All, this is a great, classy and clean restaurant to come to. The cost was a bit up there, but was expected. If I remember correctly, the bill was a little over $200.00  If your looking for a good seafood menu, this is a place to come .  Sit outside by the lake (around 9pm or later of course as it is hot during summer) as you will also have views of Camelback Mt. as well.  P.S. - their dessert is phenomenal too! :)"}
{"text":"The lobster bisque was very nice and the bread cooked on request was great. Burger was over done, but the fish tacos were good."}
{"text":"Very impressed. Service was outstanding. As soon as you finished a dish, someone was there to take the dish away. A manager took my finished beet salad plate away. I counted 7 waiters, 5 waitresses, 4 busboys, 4 managers, 3 cocktail waitresses, 3 hostesses.  Wait zipped around doing their thing, but service was not rushed. Scallops a little gritty but food quality excellent.  Beet salad excellent as well.  And I paid!  This was not a comp meal, so it's a sincere review."}
{"text":"I may not add anything new, but this was my experience.  The Chart House, located inside the Golden Nugget is first class all the way.  The modern decor and attentive, professional staff lends itself to a rewarding meal.  We were there for a business dinner with clients from out of town.  The wait was minimal and the reservation time was met spot-on.    No alchohol involved, but the ice water and tea were served with smiles and efficiency.  Appetizers of calemari (and friends/thin sliced sweet potato fries and other tasty things) and bruschetta sliders got the talk started on the tasty tidbits.  For my entre',   I selected the 8oz filet that came with a side of mashed potatos that I wish I could make at home.  The beet was perfectly seasoned, perfectly grilled to a nicely pink medium and was as tender as it needed to be.  My co-horts selected prime-ribs and a variety of the seafood plates, including the mixed seafood grill (which is on my \"next time\" list).    To cap off a great main course, we wrapped things up with a totally awesome slice of mud-pie that was meant to feed at least the seven of us.  Portioned nicely by our server, everyone was able to leave the table totally satisfied with a slightly mocha aftertaste.  Highly recommended for locals and visitors alike, this was quite the enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place, was a serious let down.  The best part was sitting next to the fish tank.  The food was barely warm when it arrived and I asked for no onions in my salad.  Did they accommodate this request--no.  The service was great, just the food we had wasn't up to par.  Would I come back--no.  There are 100's of other restaurants in this town to try, why go back for tepid expensive food."}
{"text":"If you really LIKE cold seafood, tepid prime rib, then THIS is the restaurant for you!  Table of eight, seated quickly, waiter was a little flustered and brought the wrong item completely for one of our friends.  It happens. Our plates were well presented, and the meal looked fabulous, but it was cold.  Shrimp was cold, salmon was cold, fries were cold.  Three diners sent their plates back.  The prime rib was tepid, and the potatoes were warm.  Not hot.  So the diners who didn't have food simply entertained the ones who were eating.  That's the one star.  The waiter apologized, the manager apologized.  She didn't offer to comp ANYTHING, she didn't offer dessert or a glass of wine.  Oh, and the tip was already on the bill, 18%....which was probably a good thing for our inept waiter.  Don't bother, there are plenty of great places in Scottsdale to dine."}
{"text":"Excellent. We enjoyed this restaurant very much. Our waitress Carla was very friendly and attentive. The pan seared swordfish was great. The chocolate lava cake was heaven on earth.  We also tried the calamari appetizer which was excellent. The avocado, mango, crabcake appetizer was also very good. We were stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"Beautiful location in Scottsdale. The restaurant is beautiful with a nice patio outside over looking the lake. I went here for a private party so this review is strictly for my experience with that. I'm not sure what it is like to dine in regular here. Our party was awesome it went super smooth and the waitresses were wonderful. The food menu even had GF options for people with celiacs which is amazing! The food was good, the balsamic salad dressing was delicious."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night here for the 1st time.  The food was very good, but Charles, our server, was why we would go back.  He was attentive in just the right way, and entertaining as well!  Great experience, will come back when visiting Scottsdale to see Charles."}
{"text":"Went here for a family birthday and went in with a certain plan of what we were all going to order. We had seen a special coupon from the CH web site. We all had experienced the food at many CH restaurants across California.  The several person tall fish tank was the most amazing thing to see right away. We were seated several rows away from it but observed it the entire night. The server was very nice and came back many times more than other waitresses usually do.  The coupon ended up being a bit of a hassle, as no one knew how to deal with something they had never seen. The manager had to get involved, but he visited the corporate website to confirm the details.  After this, everything was fine and we ordered dessert. I remember the dessert was prepared well and everyone enjoyed what they ordered.  I have not once had a bad experience at a Chart House since visiting many over the past 10 years, this one included."}
{"text":"They say, you can never go home, or go back. Well, I've never bought into that.   Over the years, we've been in almost a dozen or so Chart Houses. Sadly, many have closed due to whatever corporate reorg was going on at the time. I miss the ones in Steamboat and Newport, RI the most. Great locations and views.   So it was with some excitement that we made reservations here for Easter Sunday dinner. Surprisingly, we have never been to this location.  We arrived a few minutes before six and found our hostess in a middle of a hiccups fit. I offered to frighten her but she decline. I guess I was scary enough. LOL  There was also some confusion over our reservations, but it didn't last long. We were escorted to our table, over by the window with a magnificent view of the lake. You got to give Chart House credit for choosing some great locations!  We started with a glass of Merlot and Pinot each. Both were very good for house wines. We also opted for the salads, the warm bacon dressing was delicious, as was the Caesar.  Things started slowly declining from here. I asked about getting their Callahan Prime Rib End Cut ($33.99). Seems the kitchen couldn't make up their minds if they had one.   First it was no, then yes and finally surprise, they delivered a regular cut. It was tasteless with no flavor at all. When we were paying I mentioned it to our server, all they could say was, \"oh yeah.\"  Grrr. LOL. The other entree was their Beef Tenderloin Medallions ($31.99) which was very good.    For dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake to share with some coffee. It came damaged and somewhat of a mess. LOL. See our photo, versus the Chart House one. Our waiter apologized saying they should have been picked it up sooner. (Okay, why didn't you bring us another one?).   The current owners of Chart House is Landry, a very classy and sharp organization.  I would suggest they work on this location before they need to close this one too.   Our bill, including two glasses of wine ran us $80.00 a person, including taxes and gratuities.   Now why didn't we go to Capital Grill I wonder?  Well, maybe next time.  For a positive review of a Chart House, I call your attention to my friend Norm's recent experience in Las Vegas. http://www.yelp.com/biz/forte-european-tapas-bar-and-bistro-las-vegas?hrid=Gpo-2lh59Bru8sKqgRm5Hw"}
{"text":"My parents and I visited on a homecoming for my boyfriend's birthday on Mach 20th.  My boyfriend is an executive chef for José Garces in Philadelphia. I was excited to see oysters on the menu, but when they came out it was a different story.  The majority of the oysters were so dry and sticky, that they resembled chewed gum.  Only one shell had the liquid expected of a freshly shucked oyster; however, one smell and you knew they were inedible.  They offered to replace our oysters but we declined.  Because of my boyfriend's birthday we had a table that was specifically labeled VIP, but we were never touched by a manager, even after the oyster fiasco. We eagerly awaited our entrees, unfortunately my boyfriends birthday dinner of salmon and potatoes was drier than our Saguaro desert.  I'm not sure if our server was in the weeds or if they were lacking support staff, but the quality of food and service was worth half what we paid."}
{"text":"A cruise ship feel atmosphere with great views of the mountains.   The food was nicely done, but I expected some WoW flavors and over the top choices. From the moment we walked in the door the service was excellent!   The wait staff attended to our wants and kept the wine flowing."}
{"text":"What a great spot this is. The Downtown area has some real gems and this is certainly one of them. I had a hummus trio to start, which was really filling and only $7. For mains I had fish and chips, which was a perfect portion size and really well cooked. It is easy to bugger up fish and chips, so I was impressed. I then had an intimidatingly big chocolate lava cake for dessert, which was also delicious. Our server, Valerie was also brilliant, she was attentive, knowledgeable and also human, which always adds to the experience. I have been there a few times now and every time it has been brilliant. This is now going on my list of Vegas recommendations."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed...I'm a bit of a foodie so I've eaten at my fair share of great multi star restaurants.   We ordered the seafood tower for 2 at 44 dollars...2 oysters...4 prawns obviously soaked in a salt water brine...1 small lobster tail cut in half and over cooked (tough and difficult to remove from the shell) and crab legs cut in half ( they were the only redeeming offering) WAY over priced for the amount and poor quality over all!  The lobster bisque had so much sherry in it my stomach started rebelling and there was very little lobster taste...I've had much better elsewhere.  The lava cake was more like luke warm chocolate pudding cake...not even close to the quality I expect when charged 11 dollars!!!  Go to Olives...better food better atmosphere and a fair price for high quality fare.  Sure...Chart house has a cool aquarium. ..but Olives has the Bellagio fountain :-). Yeah...the manager passed by and asked if I wanted some soup and I responded \"No.\"...he walked away and I didnt see him again...right...just the kind of service I expected...NOT.  Won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"I went for lunch... the Salad was GREAT.... however I had Fish and Chips.... Kinda Skimpy and the shoe string chips were a pain to eat.... also I love Ice Tea but when my Glass is empty I would hope someone notice it and fill me up.....  The Fish Tank is lovely...   Would I go again.. Yes to get a Salad.. it was great...."}
{"text":"Had a reservation there with a party of four Christmas Day. They were 30 minutes late seating us and it went down hill from there. It took forever to get our food and anything else we needed. Two people had prime rib which was good, but not great. The mashed potatoes were stiff and cold. The person who ordered a filet med-well got a bloody, rare steak and had to send it back. My Mahi Mahi was undercooked and completely bland. Even the salad was terrible, chopped too fine and loaded with strong onions. The waitress was sweet and friendly but completely unable to keep up. No one checked to see if our food was satisfactory and it was hard to flag anyone down when we needed service. We wanted to order coffee and dessert but couldn't get anyone's attention. When we finally decided to leave without it, the waitress told us the managers were telling her to hurry and turn the tables (rush the diners!)  Never going back!"}
{"text":"I went here with a large group for an early new year's eve dinner. Great location and ambience. Considering how busy they were, we had great service. The food was mostly good- just nothing memorable (I had the ahi tuna). The best thing we had was the key lime pie and the worst was the chopped salad, it was tasteless.  The wine list is average and beer list seriously needs some work."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere but pricey!  My daughter and I each had the sea bass which was very good, however, my husband's was sent back twice.  First time the fish looked grey and the second time it was under cooked.  Service was average at best.  Our waiter seemed nervous and stressed, never asked if we wanted a second drink and seemed to be servicing more tables than he could manage.  He also pushed deserts on us knowing full well that he was already bringing a birthday desert.  Definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"We had dinner after my good friends got married. We had amazing food and a great atmosphere. Everyone in the group was impressed with the food and service. If you make reservations for a special occasion they will put your name across the top of the menu. Truly makes people feel special."}
{"text":"Visiting the Charthouse, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with the Tropical Fruit Salsa; which is a personal favorite fish of mine. I was greatly disappointed. The fish was slightly overcooked and not as moist as it needed to be. But that wasn't the worst of it. It was completely tasteless. There was no flavoring on the fish at all except for the salsa and so you had to be sure you got a little bit of salsa in every bite and there wasn't that much. I had the rice on the side and it was good. For dessert we shared a Hot Chocolate Lava Cake. Again, it was okay. Since I make this at home and have had it other places it wasn't one of those \"you can't stop eating\" desserts. The cake is chocolatey enough but then they pour more over top which I thought was just too much. I also didn't like that they put nuts on it. The service was outstanding so I gave an extra star for that. Overall not a great meal and I wouldn't go back even with that most excellent view."}
{"text":"When my bf and I are craving a decent steak without all the frills and fanciness we head over to Chart House in downtown Vegas, we love spending time out here,  beats the Strip by a long run.  The restaurant is located inside the Golden Nugget,  and has a beautiful, large aquarium display. Everytime we have been there we have gotten in without reservations, but they highly recommend them. The food is pretty awesome! For appetizer we usually get the crab, avocado, mango stack. I mean, how can you go wrong with that combo. It's light and refreshing and gets ur tastebuds ready for the next course. They give a complimentary bread basket, they are all delicious! Sometimes, depending on the waiter they will ask you if you'd like more. For salad ive gotten both the chopped and roasted beet salad. The roasted beet salad is the way to go. The dressing and candied walnuts are a-ma-zing! Don't think there is anything healthy about it, haha. My go to entree is the 9 pz filet mignon, what can I say your girl is a carnivore, always get it medium rare and it comes out cooked to perfection. I also add the mushroom truffle butter, because why not? The yukon mashed potatoes are sooo freaking good. My bf gets the wok-fried fish and he says its pretty good. For dessert we've had their famous lava cake, but it's not something to write home to your mother about :)."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Las Vegas!  FRESH seafood and it is fantastic"}
{"text":"Came here in a busy Memorial weekend for my birthday. Party of 8. We called around 3pm and made reservations same evening.  We thought the prices were reasonable. The food was insane. Maybe the best I've ever had. And I tried a ton of different dishes cause my family likes to share food.  I had prime rib, New York strip, Alaskan crab legs, whole fish with the best mango sticky rice, shrimp pasta, oysters, tempura lobster, calamari, lobster bisque, fried macaroni, tuna tacos, the spring rolls, and fancy mojitos. The table setting was amazing in front of the clean bright aquarium. The server was one of the best I've ever had and I am a major restaurant goer! We went to Prime the night before at the Bellagio and this place blew them out of the water!! We are all impressed! They had my birthday printed on the menu, they brought me the best ice cream and lava cake with an elegant candle. We could barely walk outta there we were so full! They even filled my own shot glass I brought for my b day. Classy I know.. lol. 8 people drank top notch drinks and ate top quality food and the bill was $850. Which we ended up getting comped since my brother is a big spender. Thanks bro! I'll be back over and over again!"}
{"text":"Went to Chart House for gazpacho and had yummy wine, prime rib, shrimp, and a delicious apple crisp dessert. The view of the lake is peaceful and pretty. I chose a wine flight and it was perfect with my dinner. Our waiter, Michael, was attentive and did not rush us. I would go back any time for a glass of wine and a dessert or appetizer. I would have loved to see the sunset there, but we were too early. Definitely will go back for cooler evenings, because it looks like they have a nice patio."}
{"text":"BEWARE!  This place was SUCH a disappointment! It was our last night in Vegas and I wanted to spoil myself with something I don't normally order: Lobster. This was THE most dry and chewy lobster I have EVER had! I was so disappointed. My boyfriend had ordered the crab, and while it was ok, it was cold when we got it.   The service wasn't the best but its wasn't the worst. (I have to say though for a meal that ended up costing us $200 plus dollars I feel we should've had a little better service.) I was pretty upset cause it ended our night on a bad note and I felt terrible for wasting money on a meal like this! Even the vegetables that came on the side were overcooked and mushy with no flavor. So bad that even my boyfriend said that the hot dogs at the (Viva Las Vegas) show were WAY better than his crab legs!   The only nice thing I have to say about this place is that the aquarium was pretty cool.   They also don't have their own restroom. Its a little ways down in the casino so just a heads up on that as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. The location is great. The view is phenomenal. The food is fantastic and the atmosphere is subdued and relaxed."}
{"text":"Chart House happy hour is fantastic!!  Prices are great and ambiance is fantastic. Shrimp tacos and prime rib sliders are a great meal. We had 6 plates and 2 wines for $46. Beautiful spot looking at the wonderful salt water aquarium. In the Rush tower at the Golden Nugget. Ask for Skylor."}
{"text":"On one hand, it was ambitious to be open on Christmas Day for dinner. On the other hand, they were simply understaffed and overwhelmed. Lots of customers (no one really wants to cook on Christmas), just a gorgeous looking restaurant. Good bar service, fast and attentive. But our poor waiter.....taking an order from a large table with difficult people (my relatives.....I'm sorry, God)....and having some manager type talking in his ear every 45 seconds. Oh dear. All of the food came out cold, overly sweet, just not very good."}
{"text":"Beautiful place for happy hour! The menu for HH is perfect and there's something for everyone. For $5-8 you can get a shareable calamari dish, hummus sampler, and much more. Drinks are reasonable too, and they have specialty drinks that are tasty, too. Don't forget your cool and fresh gazpacho!"}
{"text":"Overlooked and underated. Great food, friendly staff and fantastic menu. Can't go wrong by choosing here to eat."}
{"text":"Wow, i went in with high expectations and learned i set the bar too low. These folks knocked our docks off. We are now fans.   Oil be back with a group in March on business travel. Looking for other locations to visit."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants, and I seek them out any time I travel, hoping upon hope that this city has one.  It was just as good as I remembered.  We had lobster lollipops and cocktails for a starter.  My Chopin-Vodka Dirty Martini was perfect.  As usual, the Macademia Encrusted Mahi Mahi with a side of rice and the Chocolate Lava Cake (that you have to order at the beginning of the meal) were the stars of the menu...to me anyway.  They're just so damn good, I can rarely bring myself to order anything else...although I have before, and it's all good!  Beautiful view and friendly service.  1 Appetizer, 4 meals, 1 Dessert, and 2 rounds of drinks cost around $250 so prepare for about ~$60/pp or maybe $40pp w/o drinks, appetizer, and dessert.  I would also recommend the Award Winning Clam Chowder and the Mixed Grill."}
{"text":"Ever since my first visit to a Chart House in Santa Barbara, I have been in love with this restaurant and seek it out every time I travel.  The Mixed Grill is always good, and my favorite entree is the Macadamia Encrusted Mahi-Mahi.  It was still awesome.  I usually try the award-winning clam chowder for an appetizer, but this time I went with the soup trio to still get the chowder as well as the bisque and the gazpacho.  While all Chart House locations are usually built around some water-related view, I had read that this Las Vegas location was built with a view of the shark tank.  It wasn't.  It's true there was a view of a large salt water aquarium but not a view of the shark tank that makes up the middle of the Golden Nugget swimming pool, which was very disappointing.  It's a much smaller version of the other Chart Houses I've been to, and the server didn't ask us if we wanted to order the Chocolate Lava Cake when we placed our original order (which you have to do since it takes so long to make), so I forgot to order it and was a little bummed, but the food was still awesome nevertheless.  Park in the Golden Nugget parking garage and make sure to hit the left end of the Cashier Cage to push your parking ticket under the validator before you leave, so you don't have to pay for parking."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing meal from start to finish.  When we sat down we were given Happy Birthday menus, but in fact we were having a Company Christmas Party which I mentioned when making the reservation on Open Table.  I asked our server about the quality of the steaks served and she said \"Select\", I then asked her if she was sure about what she was saying and she said let me go and find out.  I ordered a Cesar salad which was served with wilted lettuce and the bread for the table was as hard as a rock.  When I mentioned it another basket was brought over with the same problem all hard bread. The Lobster bisque was luke warm and had to be sent back, the charcuterie tray was not good.  The Sea Bass was not that spectacular, unless I am invited by a business contact I will not be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Chart House is located inside the Golden Nugget in North Las Vegas.  The hotel and this restaurant are really nice!  We sat in front of the giant salt water aquarium with a really classy ambiance.  I ordered the prime rib dinner cooked medium rare.  The prime rib was juicy as can be with creamed horseradish and au jus on the side.  Very tender, perfectly cooked, not bloody at all, and without a lot of fat.  This was perfection.  The mashed potatoes were good but obviously not the show-stopper here.  Would definitely come back here again for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We made reservations for Christmas in late October for our annual dinner tradition. We were a party of 7, and when we arrived the host sat us at an unacceptable table. It was simply 3 cocktail tables pushed together and still set for 4 at each. The silver wear was left on even though those settings were in places where no one could sit. Our son had to sit on the crack in between 2 of the small tables and had nowhere to put his food. When I asked the host if they had a table more suitable for a party of 7, I was tole that people who had come earlier for those large tables. If we made reservations two months in advance, I would think a table would be set aside for us. It was very disappointing and took away from our dinner since it was difficult to make eye contact around the cocktail tables. I was even more disappointed to discover this is a Landry restaurant. We eat at Mastros often and have never had this issue. Needless to say, we would not recommend this restaurant to our friends of family."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to the Chart House in ten years and I won't be going back.  The view is always good but that's about it.  I can't believe people will spend that much money for terrible seafood when they can go to the Salt Cellar for the same price or even Ocean Club.  We spent $92.00 for two of us, no alcohol, coinciding with the salad bar.  That's an extra $9.00.  My Caesar salad was the best part of the meal.  I had shrimp stuffed with crab and my wife had scallions and shrimp.  The shrimp reminded me of the kind you buy frozen at the supermarket; they were small and rubbery.  I doubt they were even fresh.  I'd rate them with the same quality as the Red Lobster or even worse.  The crab stuffing was okay but it didn't match up with the Salt Cellar.  I can't comment on the Scallions because I never eat them but my wife left one over.  I thought she was getting sick. The service was fine but nothing special.  Stay away, make a reservation a week early for the Ocean Club or Cellar; you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"My boss assigned me the task to lead our Western Regional Meeting so I took full advantage of this, and instead of booking some generic conference room for the five of us to meet. I walked into the bar at the Chart House and with the help of the super nice bartender, put two two tables together and WA LA! Instant meeting space!   During our three hour \"meeting\" our bartender made frequent trips to our table and made sure to keep us \"hydrated'. There were plenty of dirty Ketel One martini's, Hendricks gimlets and refreshing Caipirinhas being served that helped accomplish this. We were so impressed that we booked a 9:00 table for dinner.   We arrived a little before 9PM and our table was ready. We were seated in full view of one of the most impressive aquariums I have ever seen, full of sharks, moray eels and a bunch of other dangerous looking critters. Our waiter took the time to explain some of his favorite dishes and how they were prepared. But of course we needed to have a few drinks poured first, just to make sure that they were still as good as they were earlier that afternoon.   The menu is seafood heavy as one would expect, but me who only eats normal food was not left out in the cold. There are plenty of land animals included on the menu as well as a nice selection vegetarian options. When it came time to order I went with the prime rib which came with a side of Yukon gold mashed potatoes and a side of creamed spinach. Our waiter asked how I would like it prepared which I responded \"rare\". Since we were dining later in the evening, he was not sure if this would be possible and would check with the kitchen. When my dish arrived I can tell you, it was without question rare and bloody just like I wanted. It was also served with a a side of jus and horseradish. The cut of meat was very tasty and tender and about as good as I have had anywhere. The creamed spinach was a healthy portion and more than enough to share with the six people at our table.   Another pleasant surprise was the wine list that actually included many selections that were moderately priced and several even under $40. Typically at nicer restaurants in LV I struggle to find decent wine for under $60.   It's hard for me to say which I liked more, the restaurant or the bar. The bar here is staffed by some of the most efficient and friendly bartenders in LV who never dare to water down a drink or the restaurant where you are treated to some great food in a comfortable setting."}
{"text":"I don't quite know how to rate Chart House. We came here for restaurant week with the promise of a pretty twilight lake view and delicious dinner.  We made reservations. But for some reason it took 15 minutes and 4 hostesses to seat us. We waited for our server Bucky to arrive and then felt a bit rushed to get our orders in. He talked at us like a pirate. All you could see out the window was the bright reflection of the glaring bar lights. So much for a window seat upon the lake.  Then the food came. It was delicious! I never realized that a caesar salad could be dressed up to taste this good. And the macadamia nut crusted shrimp was THE best ever. Sooo good! Yum! My date enjoyed his prime rib although it was extra fatty. He also reports that the clam chowder was only average.   Dessert became a problem. We were informed that they were all out of creme brûlée. This was a major disappointment since this drew us to their restaurant week menu. The server was also unwilling to substitute a different desert item from the regular menu. Bad call. In the end, our server surprised us with the last creme brûlée and it was soggy, mushy, and cold.  Sad face.  We overheard another table complaining to the manager about the slip up with their reservations too. Service makes a difference, folks. We walked away loving the meal but unimpressed with the disjointed experience altogether. For the price, I just won't be trying this spot again."}
{"text":"Dinner sitting next to a 75,000 gallon fish tank what else could you ask for?   Made reservations but they were not needed. The food was simply outstanding.   I ordered the Crab Cake appetizer with mustard dressing which was outstanding (5-STARS). The crab was so fresh and tasted amazing. I ordered the Jumbo Shrimp stuffed with Crab meat which came with saffron risotto & asparagus again 5-STARS.  Ordered a side of Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes' yum yum yummy.  The staff brought various different types of bread & crackers with a cream butter while we waited and it was very good.  The staff was so friendly and fast with service.   The ambience was incredible. A huge 75,000 gallon tank stocked with various fish, it was amazing watching them swim by as you enjoyed an amazing meal.   This Chart House is a hidden secret in Las Vegas without question."}
{"text":"This little jackpot is hidden away in The Golden Nugget. I would say, anyone who eats here is a winner! The jumbo shrimp cocktail should be called gigantic shrimp cocktail. It was my meal, and it came out smoking, on purpose. The crab, mango avocado salad was as pretty as it was good.  I've been to Vegas many times, and I'm mad that I just happened up this place."}
{"text":"Where do I start...went in there for Christmas eve dinner.  What a mess...first of all we got there early for our 8:45 reservations...finally got seated at 9:15...then we waited...server finally came around and dropped off some tasty bread.  I asked for a Blue Moon and he said he didn't think they had any left...my Dad ordered a dos eques...again they didnt have that...so i went with water and they did have Heineken.  I ordered two of the shrimp cocktail and calamari appetizer...which was excellent.  That took forever to show up as well.  Then comes the issues with the main course....My order came out wrong, my dads original order of Prime Rib, they ran out of but weren't told about it until well past 10:15, so he ordered the larger filet, which came out  smaller than my daughters small filet...my dads filet was luke warm at best and potatoes were actually cold, my daughters filet and potatoes were in the same temp range...really unfortunate, since the cuts of meat were great and done perfectly.  Our server was completely overwhelmed and was attempting to do his best, but in the end, everything put together made for a horrible experience...we informed the waiter of our dissatisfaction with everything...Our bill was over $300...when we left, i purposefully walked past the manager, and he wouldn't even acknowledge me...he had walked past out table a couple tomes previously, and I guess i expected at least some sort of acknowledgement from a manager of what this type of restaurant is attempting to be...what they could be, what they are pretending to be, has nothing to do with what we experienced on Christmas Eve..."}
{"text":"Delicious place   My friend picked this place for our weekly Sunday dinner we were very happy   Our server was very friendly and nice was very helpful with recommendations when we couldn't decide what we wanted to eat  everything just sounded so yummy?  I started with the oysters since there my favorite  very delicious! My friend got the crap stack I believe it was called I had a few bites it was extremely yummy and tasteful the mango really gave it some flavor   We shared the crap legs  we loved that they came open for you so u didn't have to fight to get to the meat perfect   I got the scallops  perfectly cooked great seasoning and very yummy yummy sauce.....  For dessert we have the chocolate lava cake  very warm and delicious( I'm not suppose to have sweets lol training life)   I would totally come back again?? I don't think it las very well promoted since I had never herd of it but it's worth every dollar"}
{"text":"We should have had happy hour in the bar. Instead we had their fixed price dinner in the restaurant. The first course selections weren't that great. I had the artichoke and my companion had the hummus. They were ok. Dinner course was very disappointing. We had the macadamia but crusted chicken. The chicken was over cooked and very dry. And it came with a mound of rice and no vegetables. Apparently the restaurant wants you to pay $6 more for the salad buffet. Dessert was the best. I had the line habanero ice cream and my companion had the mud pie. When all was said and done it wasn't worth the $135 we spent (drinks, taxes and tip included). The service, however, was superb. Our server was great the bar manager was rude. We ordered drinks from the bar during happy hour before we were seated. We were going to transfer the drink cost to our final bill but the bar manager wouldn't let us. I wonder if they thought we were trying to get free drinks??? I handed the bill to the hostess and asked her to have it transferred and the bartender chased us down and demanded payment. It was embarrassing and rude. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Prices are a little high but they make up for it with atmosphere -- a massive, beautiful aquarium that's visible from every table! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Upscale Restaurant in Golden Nugget with great Prime Rib which is what I had and it was served perfectly. Waiter was a class act also. Used to work at McCormick & Schmicks and brought his class skills with him  Waiter suggested oysters which were superb and also stated the Calamari was worth a try. It was very good as it was prepared very different than I had had it before.  A friend had a butterflied Filet with blue cheese and I was wishing I had ordered that along with the Prime Rib LOL  Very good experience and I would happily dine here again especially since my wife and I got out for under $90"}
{"text":"Ok this is my second review of a restaurant in the Golden Nugget that is all not that good.  We went to the Chart House envisioning a nice dinner of prime rib and seafood.  It started out good with drinks and we ordered appetizers of fried calamari.  We ordered dinner and the waiter took the order for half the table and then said, \"oh sorry we are all out of prime rib\". REALLY?!  this is what the restaurant says it is know for and yet you don't have any!  I think that they should have let us know that when we sat down.  Of the 13 people in the party, 9 people had ordered prime rib.  Then in a weird way, the waiter came out and said they found 3 pieces of prime rib.  Where was the prime rib?!  Hidden?!  I spoke to the manager on duty and he didn't seem to be concerned. He told me, \"sorry.\"  I mentioned that it should have been shared with us prior to sitting down and he said, \"once I heard your table was ordering prime rib I went to the kitchen and found 3 pieces.  The waiter said that it wasn't a big deal, they had other cuts of meat.  It doesn't sit well when we came in for prime rib. We were provided 3 pieces of ice cream pie for our inconvenience.  Hum and bill of over $800 and we are suppose to feel special because we got 3 pieces of ice cream pie.  It was a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"It's been a little over a year since the last time I ate here....  This time we left the kid with a sitter and came with a couple of grown ups (technically).  We had just come from some LVMMA fights at the Hilton and were kind of tipsy... I mean, hungry.  The general consensus: We should have just ordered apps.... not entrees.  Once again we went with the calamari and fried mac and cheese as well as lobster spring rolls that were on their special 40th or 50th anniversary menu (like I said... we were too .... hungry.... to remember the details).  The spring rolls were more like massive egg rolls, but tasty nonetheless. I ordered the amazing beet salad again and was stuffed before entrees came out.  As for the entrees, we ordered 2 Chart House platters, free range chicken and the shrimp scampi. The platters were huge and greasy (lobster tail, coconut shrimp, more calamari, french fries.... all deep fried and chewy).  The chicken was small but I guess it was good enough for my lover (who's watching his weight haha) and the scampi \"tasted like Pasta Roni\".  Our server was a nice enough guy but  I probably won't be coming back here for dinner for at least another year... we'll stick to the 99cent foot longs and fried oreos from Mermaids across the street.  Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Huge aquarium, great drinks, excellent service and fantastic food - does it get any better?  We arrived at the Golden Nugget late Saturday night and were looking for a decent place to eat. We had no idea what the Chart House was all about when we sat down, but we quickly noticed how everything was top-notch. As I was unfolding my white napkin to place on my lap, the hostess stopped me and handed me a black napkin - so the napkin wouldn't leave white lint on my black dress. How attentive and thoughtful!  Drinks: ultimate margarita and strawberry daiquiri - Both were excellent.  Appetizer: hummus sampler - Regular, red pepper and edamame hummus served with bread pieces and plantain chips. I really loved the green taste of the edamame. This was probably enough for three people.  Entree: filet mignon - This comes with mashed potatoes, though they're not mentioned on the menu. I also ordered a loaded baked potato. Everything was excellent, especially the filet which was exactly medium well as requested.  Dessert: chocolate lava cake - This is out of this world. It takes 30 minutes to create after ordering, so order before you're done with your meal. The cake comes with ice cream, hot fudge and Heath bar pieces. Ah-mazing!  This would be a great place for a romantic dinner, but it was also perfect for the large wedding party sitting behind us."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to going to this restaurant.  It has a nice view of a man-made pond, but the food is barely average.  If the ambience wasn't so nice, it would get only 2 stars."}
{"text":"Chart House is a favorite of mine from way back in the day. What a pleasant surprise this dining experience was.  It was as good as I remembered.  Salad bar is just sooooo good.  Joshua was our waiter and he was super nice and professional.  The ambience was amazing on the lake.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Horrible!  I came here to have dinner with my family (party of 8) after I got married and it was terrible. The service was horrible from the server AND the manager! A steak came out well done, rather than medium rare, so it was sent back. Around thirty minutes later, after everyone else was done eating, the steak finally came back out. Mind you, we had to ask the server and the manager twice for it.  When the server handed my mom the bill I checked to see if the steak was on there. It was! I asked the server for this to be removed since he sat there and watched us eat while his medium rare steak took 30 minutes to come back out. She went to ask the manager and he agreed, finally!  Since the tip was automatically factored in for a party of 8, we didn't leave her anything extra. She was rude, slow and unattentive.   For the price of this expensive restaurant and the quality of service you receive, I definitely would NOT recommend it."}
{"text":"Have you ever heard the expression \"Presentation is Everything!\", well this is one of the times that doesn't apply.   The presentation of the food is great and the ambiance and scenery is great as well, however the taste of the food is just so-so.   Me and my wife went to The Chart House to take advantage of their Restaurant Week 3-Course Special.   We both started with the Caesar Salad, which was small and had a string Anchovy taste. The parmesan cheese and croutons were good and the salad was crisp but the dressing ruined the salad. For great Caesar Salad go to The Melting Pot or Mad Greens  We shared the Macadamia Nut Encrusted Chicken and the Maple & Ginger Glazed Salmon, both came with Coconut Ginger Rice.  The Chicken was served in a peanut sauce which didn't really add to the Chicken, the Chicken was good but would have been better if the macadamia nuts were crushed rather than larger chopped pieces. The Salmon tasted like plain salmon, apparently the Maple ginger glaze was either forgotten or it just ran off the salmon to the bottom of the dish because that was the only place there was any sauce.  The Coconut Ginger Rice didn't have any noticeable Coconut flavor or Coconut flakes, and the ginger flavor wasn't very pleasing.   We finished with the Vanilla Creme Brûlée, which was done perfect and was very good.   If I were to go again i would probably try the Crispy Coconut Shrimp because that's hard to get wrong or just have the Creme Brûlée and a drink after the sun goes down.   WARNING: The chairs in the back room by the deck are very uncomfortable. The chair legs extend all the way up into the chair pad, not under it, and jam you in the bottom of your legs.   Last critique about this restaurant, the floor plan is very cramped with pillars in wall way areas and the waiting area/host counter is in the path to get to the restrooms or out of the restaurant and feels like an obstacle course. Really needs a new floor plan."}
{"text":"Took perverse glee in watching the critters in the strikingly beautiful aquarium while eating their kin.  Ask for seating in the area \"behind\" the bar, meaning on the opposite side of the aquarium. You get a full-field-of-vision view of the aquarium and it's a little more private so that you're not part of the show.  Be sure also to talk with your server about what's fresh and to me, if you're at a seafood place, get seafood. Skip the land-based options (ribs, steak)."}
{"text":"Lovely meal! The filet mignon was cooked perfectly, and the stuffed tilapia was perfect! We had the chocolate lava cake for desert...AWESOME! Dinner for two without alcohol was over $100.."}
{"text":"Located in the Golden Nugget Casino on Fremont Street.  What a cool restaurant!  It has a huge fish tank in the middle of it!    Obviously, they specialize in seafood but also serve up some good land lovers food.  An assortment of breads were served immediately after we were seated (no reservations needed on the Thursday night we dined there).  Shortly, afterwards we were presented our bottle of wine.  Everything is al a carte at Chart House, so be careful not to over-order like us!  We start off our hunger excursion with two salads.  My fiance ordered a caesar* which was average tasting, and I devoured a spinach salad* (YUMMO)!  The salads were both quite large, so you may want to split some of your dishes up.    And because my fiance's eyes are larger than his stomach, he ordered a bowl of clam chowder*.  This too was quite large.  He said it was one of the best clam chowders he's ever had!  (*Pictures of items)  As most of you Yelpers know, I am a steak lover!  More to the point, a filet mignon lover.  Chart House served a decent filet for a seafood place, though defintely NOT the best I've ever had.  It was large, plump, and cooked near perfectly.  For sides, we ordered the asparagus and fried mac and cheese.  I didn't try the asparagus but did try the fried mac.  It was good but way too big and heavy.  It could've been a meal in itself.  I guess we were hungrier than we thought that night because we had to take a doggy bag home...    Chart House is a beautiful restaurant that is well-kept.  Service was on par and prices were average for a restaurant of this caliber."}
{"text":"Chart house is an amazing dining experience.  In short, the staff communicates and works well together from the front of the house to the back of the house, increasing the odds of an excellent customer experience with well set expectations.  As you enter the business, the Chart House's huge aquarium greets its guests.  If you're lucky enough, you'll sit next to the aquarium and ponder when feeding time is for the fish, if the fish are upset about me eating seafood, and where their eel is hiding.  Harris, our server, was nothing short of exceptional.  He was conversational, an expert in the menu, and catered perfectly to our dietary needs. Beyond the food menu, they boast an fantastic cocktail menu and wine selection - and Harris was great at making drink recommendations based on our specific tastes.  When my wife and I eat seafood, the volume typically gets out of hand.  This visit is no exception.  We had the large tower: not so \"shrimpy\" shrimp, British Columbia oysters, lobster tail, king crab, and tuna.  It's all fresh and enough to feed 4, helping my wife and I exceed the menu's expectations only needing 2 people.  The tuna had a soy sauce accompaniment that the kitchen was kind enough to keep separate due to my gluten free dietary restriction.  For our entrees, my wife had the lobster tail and I had the surf and turf, also with a lobster tail.  They brought my steak and her lobster tail out first both cooked perfectly.  To prove how well they communicate, almost every member of their staff was sure to let me know that my lobster tail was on the way.  It's even nicer to know that the kitchen stopped the delivery of the first tail based on quality - a nice touch to know they're looking out for their customers.  For dessert, we had another cocktail.  There wasn't a chance that these two individuals bursting at the seems and lacking a sweet tooth of any kind would plow down dessert, but there's always room for more alcohol.  Beginning to end an amazing experience that I'd be sure to go out of my way to repeat any time in Las Vegas. It's possibly the best dining experience available off Fremont Street."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch last year with my family, and we all thought it was great. Fabulous setting & ambience with that fish tank, delicious seafood, great drinks.   This year, we went there for Happy Hour and had a great time. The small plates were all so delicious. We had a large group, so we basically ordered one of all the small plates from their HH menu. Highly recommend the firecracker shrimp and the sliders. Their HH drink menu also has some tasty & tipsy numbers. I can't remember the name of the pineapple drink, but omg, it was amazing. The rest of our party was downing the mojitos, which were also good.  Had no idea this was such a great place for a HH, will be hitting it up again."}
{"text":"There is no doubt this is a beautiful restaurant.  Nice plush location just inside the lobby of the new Rush Tower at the Golden Nugget.  Very casual/contemporary and comfortable.  It sits beautifully surrounding a large aquarium.  Service was as good as can be expected for this type of establishment.  Service staff were friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and quite good.  Started with a Mojito for me and a Mango Mojito for my lovely spouse.  We were both very pleased, these were 5 star drinks.  Also had the crab stack and it was another home run.  Then onto the main meal...the CH Specialty and the Mixed Plate.  Let's just say, we are both seafood snobs having lived a long time in Vancouver, BC and Seattle.  Sadly, the main courses were just average.  Really not too much better than a Red Lobster or similar chain place.  That's kind of sad.  But with the great location, super drinks, friendly and helpful staff we came away pleased.  Just would like to report that the main course was superb, but it just wasn't , so only 3 stars for me."}
{"text":"Using the term \"fine dining\" here is a bit of stretch. The service here was lackluster to say the least, but the food was good enough to keep me in high spirits.   I brought my family here for a little Valentine's Day late afternoon lunch. When we showed up, the place was empty. Literally, we were the only people sitting in the restaurant which was a little awkward. We were sat promptly and we immediately were in awe of the enormous fish tank. This floor to ceiling is an aquarium lovers wet dream is amazing, ha! It's placed right in the middle of the restaurant and gives diners a great place to rest their eyes and thoughts during lulls in dinner conversation.  We ordered apps and drinks and so far so good. A bottle of wine for the table and I opted for Moscow Mule. It was ok, a little heavy on the ginger beer and light on the vodka. I prefer it the other way around. The apps were amazing; the Kim Chee Calamari was like crack, I would smoke it if allowed. The Kim Chee added that vinegar flavor that went great with lightly fried calamari. There fried veggies and a amazing sauce that accompanied this dish. I highly recommend ordering this dish, but be ready to share because this plate of food is huge! We also ordered the Coconut Crunchy Shrimp and these were great. A little outshined after the Kim Chee dish, but still very good. The shrimp was still juicy and not over cooked and the coconut breading was light and just a tad sweet. Yummers.   At this point in the meal we were all talking, plates were licked clean, and starting to stack up. Just as the restaurant was just starting to get busy our soup and salads were arriving, so you'd think the server would remove the plates that were stacked up, but nope, they stayed on the table. After salads and soups were finished (BTW - Lobster Bisque was quite delicious) this new set of plates and bowls were now added to already decent pile of tableware. There were five of us, so lets do that math... 5 plates for apps + 2 bowls of soup + 2 large salad plates + 2 bread baskets + 5 bread plates +1 bottle of wine + 3 wine glasses + 2 cocktail glasses, and a partridge in a pear tree. That's about 23 items on a table, half of which were dirty and no longer being used. Now, in a normal fine dining restaurant, these items would be cleared immediately and the table would be re-dressed with silverware and napkins. This did not happen.   The main course showed up and the food runners realized there was absolutely no space for anything on the table. They placed our food off to the side and cleared the table, this took about three minutes. This just shows the amount of stuff that had piled up. Finally, the table is cleared and the food is delivered.   I'll mainly focus on my meal, but I did try a little bit of everyone's and it all was very good. I ordered the Stuffed Flounder: Crab-stuffed with lemon shallot butter and Yukon Gold mashed potatoes. This was delicious, the flounder was perfectly cooked. The tender fish was juicy and just flaked apart when cut into with my fork. The crab was a like an amazing edible surprise, that I had forgot about it until it poured out on to the plate. This plate was not only gorgeous, but a giant seafood flavor bomb. The carb lovers side dish was the beautiful golden mashed potatoes. Buttery, creamy goodness!   To close out the meal we tried their dessert specials... Hot Chocolate Lava Cake and Chart House Souffle. These were both meh, but I'm not a sweet person. So don't take my word for it.   Wow. I feel like I just had a brain baby with this review. Even though the service was weak, The Chart House's food is stellar and definitely worth the price.    FOODIE NOTE: The food prices here almost triple once the lunch menu is done being served. So, if you're a baller on budget you might want to lunch it up."}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome! The ambience alone was amazing! The food was good too, but not sure if it it worth the price.we must've been paying for the experience? Huge, gorgeous fish tank to watch while you dine. Would definitely eat here again next time we stay here!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever, we waited for 45 min to get our steaks,once we received our food it was over cooked (we ordered medium rare) and the service was terrible! I will not be returning to this establishment anytime soon."}
{"text":"New Year's Eve were in Las Vegas first time at the chart house the most amazing dinner I've ever had steak juicy mouthwatering mac & cheese you need to come and try it the most incredible I've ever had!!! Highly recommend this place anytime you're in Vegas!! No other steakhouse has anything on this one!! Joanna was the best server ever courteous nice really on point I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Expensive but VERY GOOD! Great service too! Reservations a must, Then go outside and enjoy the craziness of Fremont St."}
{"text":"Based on the incredible seared Chilean Sea Bass, this place gets 5 stars!!!!!  It was simply outstanding.   Cooked to perfection and very well balanced flavor.  Before I ate here, I had my doubts about a seafood chain restaurant being on this level, but they have won me over!  Not the quietest dining experience, but the service was also very attentive."}
{"text":"When pulling up to this restaurant I had a great feeling. Such a pretty setting.... And that was the best thing I experienced here. The staff was rude and the food was not worth the price. It started with the host telling us that the patio was closed, even though we called at 3:30 earlier to verify we could have patio seating at 7:30. Did I mention that it is march in Phoenix and 75 degrees. Reluctantly, we were sat on the patio but the server made sure we paid for his inconvenience. He had to open an extra door. Every question or request was met with a snappy comment. We end up asking for a new server and the manager was mildly sympathetic. We would have left right away if we were not with other dinner guests and very hungry. They brought one of our guests the wrong meal and the food was good but not great. Over priced in my opinion. That being said the discounted our $300.00 bill by $75. I don't plan to go back anytime soon. If you choose to go here, good luck."}
{"text":"So we were here to run the annual Komen Race for the Cure 5k race and the only 4 star or higher hotel in downtown Las Vegas is the Golden Nugget, so we stayed here overnight to avoid the parking nightmare on race day. I made a reservation the night before the race at this restaurant b/c it was convienent and figured our 6 yr old would like the huge aquarium. Glad, we made a reservation b/c it was busy! They sat us right next to the aquarium, which was thoughtful for the little one. She loved it! Surprisingly, the food we ordered was actually pretty good! The East meets West Tuna appetizer was both unique and tasted great (high quality tuna). The little one was all over the calamari, which had a mix of peppers & tempura style veggies added. Our entrees were on par, had the halibut & hubby had a surf & turf dish, both cooked & presented well. Pleasantly surprised by this place! The cocktail menu was great too, has something for everyone. Prices aren't that bad either for what you get. Hopefully it's consistent when we come back."}
{"text":"Not along the beach?  Sure, but this location does just fine.  Some of the better seafood in the desert in one of the deserts better location.  Go at dusk so you can watch the sun set behind Camelback mountain from the deck. The food is top notch and reasonably priced relative to its class.  The prime rib is very flavorful and exceptionally tender,.and you get a very healthy portion.  And seafood...yes seafood.  Personal favorites include the macadamia nut encrusted mahi mahi and the shrimp fresca.  I don't usually say this but make room for dessert.  The Creme Brulee is top notch."}
{"text":"The Chart House use to be a real gem - sadly, things have changed. I took two of my brothers there for what I promised would be a fantastic steak-and-lobster dinner. First, although hardly anybody else was in the restaurant they stuck us at the warmest table (facing the sun) they had. Our lobster was not fully cooked; and, our asparagus was thick and tough. This place is way over priced and past its prime..."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! First of all, it's strategically placed right next to a large pond, which make the views beautiful... especially at sunset time!   We started off with a Mango Mojito, which was absolutely delicious! Not overpowering on the mint or the mango! Very nicely done!  Then, I opted for the Mixed Seafood Grill (grilled citrus salmon, shrimp scampi & a jumbo lump crab cake, served with Yukon Gold mashed potatoes & asparagus). Holy moly! There was so much food but it all tasted so delicious and was so flavorful! My favorite though would definitely have to be the shrimp scampi!  We couldn't end the night without trying their dessert, that they sneakily talk you into when taking your order. The Hot Chocolate Lava Cake takes 30 minutes to make, so you have to order it when you order your food... and let me tell you, it was definitely worth every calorie! Such a yummy, chocolately goodness!  I will say that this place is pretty pricey, so I wouldn't go often. But definitely worth it for a nice evening out! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"how could you screw up a fried fish platter? very easily at the CH in vegas! every thing was over salted and the breadding was was soggy like it came off the bottom... it was gross ! Sorry CH just had to pay for cadada. it's lucky that 18% included on the bill. the best thing is the lava cake."}
{"text":"This place was OK. the prime rib was good but not the beat I ever had.  The waitress was cool which almost made this a 4.  Asparagus was not the best. Clam Chowder is very good.   Lava cake was to die for. We were stuffed and still ate it all."}
{"text":"Have been dining here for years.  Wonderful setting, upgraded carpet and chairs are a very nice touch.  Salad Bar was the best it has been in 20 years!  Delicious.  Entree's were cooked perfectly.  Chocolate lava cake for dessert was yummy.  Great experience. Probably the best meal we have ever had here.  They are on the top of their game!"}
{"text":"One of those chain places that has some expensive landscaping.    It does overlook a man made lake.  A LAKE IN THE DESERT.  If you want lakes, move.  The desert is not for you.  The food here is nothing special and priced as a five star.  It's seafood for people with too much money and not enough taste."}
{"text":"Excellent! The food was great, the service was great, the atmosphere was great...notice a trend? Our server (Brandon) was spot on with his service and made excellent suggestions. If you have time definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was beautiful. We were seated next to the aquarium for our 2 year anniversary celebration. Some of the food items, however, were a hit or miss. The drinks were great. I would recommend the mango mojito. The server brought out warm bread with butter and that was delicious. For appetizers, we ordered the chilled lobster and shrimp spring rolls. It was quite disappointing for the price because I've had much better spring rolls at Asian restaurants. This one was cold and somewhat bland. The lobster bisque was creamy and delicious. Finish it while its hot or it won't be as enjoyable. For the main course, I got the Mac Nut Mahi because it was a high recommendation. I wasn't very impressed by the dish because the flavor combination was not my preference. The purple yams had a strange taste and were too sweet and steered away from its natural flavors. The fish didn't seem to go well with the peanut sauce. However, my boyfriend enjoyed it so it's personal preference. He ordered the filet mignon and it was perfectly cook. You pay for the quality of meat, not the quantity. Overall it was a great experience, but a few misses on the dishes we ordered. The ambiance is a hit."}
{"text":"Loved loved the tuna tare tare with wasabi cream, fried Mac + Cheese, and Yellowfin Tuna w/ saffron risotto. I couldn't get enough!  The Bleu cheese stuffed filet mignon was dull in comparison.   I was a bit disappointed with the desert selection. I would have liked to see a bit more adventure as I desperately wanted to close the night with a sweet treat, but nothing sounded good enough to waste more calories. Boo."}
{"text":"Review for the happy hour only:  2 1/2 stars... one for the service, one for the lettuce wraps and Mediterranean Chicken Pita, and a half star for the aquarium (which is amazing!). The rest is whatever.  My parents and wife really like this place but I am just not that convinced. The seats in their lounge area are super small, and the tables they have (not at the booth) are even smaller. We ordered 3 happy hour dishes and couldn't fit them on the table. I had to put my drink on the ground and eat from a small dish over my lap. The booths that we sit in sometimes are very comfortable and can hold enough appetizers for the four of us. But the \"table\" by the bar are meant more to set a few drinks down on and look at the aquarium.   As mentioned above I only really like those apps. I have had the firecracker shrimp and don't think it is spicy enough to warrant \"firecracker\" in the title, and doesn't give off enough kim chee flavor. The prime rib sliders are good, but I am not a fan of the horseradish sauce. Way too much horseradish for my liking. The Humus platter is tasty, but... who goes anywhere just for the humus.   Maybe I should come in and try the regular menu, but the happy hour is worth the price of drinks and a view of the aquarium. I will say that the $7 cocktails are all well made, and the servers are excellent! See you soon Golden Nugget... and maybe Chart House."}
{"text":"Applejack Cherry Chilean Seabass was highlight.  Their Grand Marnier Souffle was not that special, not impressed.  Service was ok."}
{"text":"I don't know Scottsdale too well but I'm pretty sure there aren't many waterfront views in the city. The joke with Uber drivers when we pass a canal is that there's the waterfront living. Chart House is located close to a golf course and there's a big lake that this restaurant sits on. With this you get a beautiful view of both the golf course and this lake. There isn't much light pollution so if you have the opportunity to sit outside (heat permitting), do so, and enjoy the evening skies.  Immediately upon entering their private dining room, I was excited for the views and what was in store with dinner.  What didn't I love about Chart House?  - Salad bar. Legit.  - Fire roasted shrimp - I took two when people weren't paying attention. - The captain cut prime rib - OMG, so delicious. This cut is 14 oz and now represents two weeks of red meat in my life per doctor orders. I'm glad I used my lifeline with these folks. This was juicy and tender and packed with amazing flavors. - Asparagus served with my rib was great. It's worth adding mushrooms as an additional side, too. - Cheesecake - ya know, service was so stellar that I didn't order the cheesecake. The server heard me say how much I love cheesecake and brought it out for me. I was on another company's tab so I assumed there was a big budget for the night so any conversation on food was assumed that it was an order. In normal circumstances, I assume they would normally ask and confirm before bringing a dessert to you. In this case, I was ecstatic.  It's definitely a fancy restaurant but knowing how hot it gets in AZ you can go casual and not feel out of place. Our party was almost 20 folks and service was impeccable.   I hope to return to Chart House in the future."}
{"text":"We decided on Chart House for our anniversary dinner, as we had been there before a couple of years prior and enjoyed that experience. The atmosphere is nice, the restaurant is quiet, and the ambience was appealing. Our experience this time was less than wonderful. The staff was great and service was very good but honestly the food quality was so-so given the expense. That is to say it was much what you would expect from a restaurant chain where food is drenched with butter and salt to give it flavor and you go home feeling bloated and disgusting from the meal. The appetizer (we had something with crab and shrimp, avocado and mango) was rather bland, really, given the appealing combination of ingredients. I would recommend something like fresh lemon or something to give it a tad more flavor, but it was at least fresh. My wife had a dish with scallops, shrimp and gnocchi and while it was flavorful, it was too rich and the flavor wasn't the sort of nuanced combination of delicious ingredients one would normally expect from a higher-end restaurant. The same was true for the herb-encrusted snapper I chose. The bed of sauce it lay in tasted like cream and butter and the side of spinach we had was the same way. I'm sure all told we had in excess of 10,000 calories between us and frankly, the food probably didn't taste all that different from something you'd get at Red Lobster, which we avoid like the plague. One with a refined palate would not count this choice among one's short list of places to go for food quality and next time we'll look elsewhere as for us the experience needs to be both culinary AND atmospheric if we're going to spend $175 for a meal, which is what our bill came to. It's hard enough to spend $45 for a typical $14 bottle of merlot without the food being at best, well, average chain restaurant fare."}
{"text":"I would probably give this restaurant two starts but the manager was really wonderful. Came here on my last visit to Vegas while I was staying at the Golden Nugget. My friend wanted to try the Stone Crabs. I'm not a crab person so I can't really comment- we got 5 claws for $50. Presentation was nice, sauces for dipping were good- what went wrong? My salad. I ordered the beet and arugula salad- but I am allergic to peanuts and shrimp. So I made sure to tell the server about my allergy. (Chart House does not keep any peanuts in the restaurant). That is when the manager came over and informed me what i could order that was free from shrimp and what could be a potential reaction. I told him I was ordering the beet salad- he said that was safe.  The beet salad includes prosciutto crisps, blue cheese, mandarin oranges, red onions, caramelized pecans and the dressing. All I asked was for the cheese the onions on the side. I do not know why we were served a salad with only beets on top of spinach! No arugula. No prosciutto, no pecans, no mandarin oranges- idk what happens from my order being \"I would like the roasted beet salad but can the onions and cheese be on the side?\" When she brought the salad out I wanted to ask \"so where is the rest of it?\" I ended up just eating it- which I regret I should have sent it back. Not worth regular prices for beets on spinach.   I will probably not return to this restaurant with so many choices in Las Vegas, there is no room for a repeat."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful lunch meeting here last week with a great view of the famous aquarium. While we were eating the aquarium was being cleaned by professional divers and the experience was surreal. I had the watermelon/feta salad and the blackened flounder with asparagus, and walked out in that sweet zone between hungry and stuffed, also known as 'just right'. Service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Found this for a business meeting and we were all very impressed by everything we ate from the Mac Nut-crusted Mahi to the roasted Salmon. Even the sides of green beans and the delicious mushrooms were amazing. But the capper was the Chocolate Lava cake! Definitely order the Peanut Butter ice cream to go with it. So worth it! Wonderful service as we had a lot to discuss and weren't rushed through the meal. Loved the Pinot Grigio our waiter recommended to go with the fish. Speaking of which, the fish in the tank were very entertaining to watch. Will definitely be back the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our experience here for restaurant week. Over 20 min wait to get sat for our 730 reservation, 15 min to get greeted by server, 30 min for pathetic starter salads. Food overall was mediocre, told manager when he came by the table about the slow service and he said they \"like to pace things slower\" ... ok maybe for your 75 year old guests, but I work in fine dining and this meal shouldn't have taken over 2 hours, especially for what we got. Thank god it was Restaurant Week so pricing wasn't absurd, because no way would I pay the pricing they have for what we got."}
{"text":"It was a great dinner with great service. The food was delicious. Nice location if your ever looking for place for dinner ask for a window seat."}
{"text":"IN ADDITION:  we ordered a Thanksgiving dinner to go, they included NO turkey. Just potatoes and a slice of pie. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"This restaurant is INCREDIBLE! The restaurant is small and intimate with the giant aquarium in the middle. It provides amazing ambiance and it is entertaining to watch during dinner service.   We started off with the charcuterie board to nosh on. I loved all of it except one of the salamis and one of the cheeses were very dry and difficult to chew. Everything else was delicious and I especially loved the smoked ghouda.   I ordered the 7 oz filet topped with crab, lobster, and lemon shallot butter. The meat was perfectly tender and the lobster and crab meat on top was so tasty! I didn't get any sense of the lemon shallot butter though.   We decided to order the Grand Marnier Souffle for dessert. It was so light, fluffy, and just the right amount of sweetness. The sauce on the side was a nice touch of extra sweetness for the eggy flavor of the souffle that was here and there throughout parts of the souffle.   All in all, will definitely be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Nice location, good ambience, willing server but uncooked sea bass.  Enough said.  We won't be back.  The chef let them down and neither our server nor the manager was surprised.  Guess this happens frequently."}
{"text":"We always enjoy the Chart House at the Nugget and request Harris as our waiter if he is working. Impeccable service and chats it up with us when he has time.  I ordered blackened Halibut with the fruit/mango topping. It was absolutely amazing and the kick of the blackened seasoning with the mango was fabulous. Various vegetables and appetizers were pretty basic, but tasty. Yummy shrooms! A little fresh creativity would be wonderful in the appetizers and \"sides\" departments, but that's just my preference, not the quality overall.  The only negative was the hostesses. They moved us from a small table right by the fish tank, to a booth, when we requested it..... Instead of the two open booths with a perfect view of the tank, our new table was tucked in the corner by the makeshift \"water station\" for the waitstaff with a huge pillar blocking our view of the tank. As a bonus, someone was coming or going constantly, and it killed any privacy or relaxation we got in between.   It appears that it was not the designed intent of that little area....Management needs to step it up and relocate the water pitcher area elsewhere and  amend the dress code so it prohibits the hostesses from wearing outfits off clearance rack at Hot Topic. Chart House may be inside the Golden Nugget in old Vegas, but it doesn't have look like the hostesses are the offspring of their cocktail waitresses.   When I asked for a wine glass to take with my bottle back to our suite upstairs, I was graciously offered a juice glass by one of girls...really? This is what comes of hiring girls that aspire to be...nothing."}
{"text":"Food ok but bad operation. I'm not going to call it bad service, because our waiter was clearly following orders. He pushed the specialty drinks even though we knew what we wanted to drink, he pushed the appetizers even though we didn't want any, and - the biggest issue of all - when presenting the (hefty) bill, he gave us the pitch for the 'Landry's club' - sign up for free and get points, discounts, blah blah ... pay $25 (even though 'free' ... it's credited to your first meal ...)... SURELY they should understand that if you go to a high-end restaurant you don't expect to be thinking about getting coupons and discounts at 10pm on a Friday night after a relaxing meal!"}
{"text":"Don't believe them when they wrotw that they wanted to make it right. Thatwad just for yelp readers. They aent an email, I answered questions, and dis nothing. I will apend mu disposable income elsewhere.   We've been seated for 22 minutes and still no greeting and no drink order. We may walk out. Poor service.  Update: We left. The people next to us has been there before us an just got appetizers. A chef finally came out and apologized but by that point good service would have comped something like drinks. Poor service. Never returning. Going to melting pot."}
{"text":"Slow service and sub par food. Clam chowder was barely warm and bland. Prime rib was overcooked and mostly fatty, mashed potatoes were cold and hard as a rock. Waiter was extremely slow and never came to check on us during our meal. After dinner we ordered coffee and it was full of grounds. Overall not worth the price for what you get, would not return."}
{"text":"i will not write a long story about my visit, just in 1 sentence my daughter asked for glass of ice-water and got a whole pencap embedded in the ice, unfortunately she drank 1/4 of it  i will post the picture"}
{"text":"Since I have been to other Chart Houses, I expected more. This was the worse of all I have visited. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Lets mention the good first. The fish tank was beautiful and position of the restaurant in the Casino is excellent , close to a side entrance.  The service was good but average for this grade of restaurant.  Now the bad,  the entire restaurant is tiny and looks like an add on to what was a nice aquarium bar. Because of that, the seating is terrible, everyone is right on top of one another.  Some of the seating is right at the check out in the way of the entrance and exit of customer creeping by. The entrance is hard to find, really looks like you are going to the bar. Now the food, is C-, it would be an A if you were at McDonalds, but not for the prices they charge. The lamb chops were small and underccooked and not well seasoned.  My Chilian Sea Bass was good but small and not seasoned well. Sides were separate.  Worse yet I have often bragged of the excellent Caesar salad, hand made with anchovies at the Chart House. Well not at this one!. No anchovies, no hand made, no signature dish. There are so many excellent restaurants in Las Vegas, there is no need to drop several hundred dollars at this after thought."}
{"text":"We visit LV twice a year and always stay at the Golden Nugget.  Since it opened, the Rush Tower is our favorite place to stay.  In the lobby of the Rush Tower is the gorgeous Chart House restaurant.  We have eaten here every time we've stayed and it has always been excellent!  This trip was our wedding/honeymoon trip and we couldn't let it go by without a visit to this fine establishment.  The ambience is casual but elegant.  The service is impeccable.  We began our meal with the lobster bisque.  This was strongly recommended to us by a staff member of another GN restaurant and I am SO glad we tried it!  It is heaven!  We followed with the spinach salad.  This salad was so beautiful upon presentation that it was almost a shame to have our server toss it and for us to eat it.  However, we did and were not disappointed!  For my entrée I enjoyed the mixed seafood grill; grilled citrus salmon, shrimp scampi and a lump crab cake.  Delicious!  My husband thoroughly enjoyed the seared Mahi topped with lobster and jumbo lump crab. I tried a taste of the Mahi and it was great!  We ended the meal with one of their signature desserts, Hot Lava Chocolate Cake (another highly recommended item) and it was spectacular!  The chocolate \"lava\" inside is extremely rich and decadent and is complimented by the vanilla ice cream.    Thank you, Chart House, for yet another lovely dining experience!"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, excellent service (the manager even dropped by), and very good seafood - especially for Las Vegas and more especially for downtown where we've struggled in the past to find a good restaurant (in our opinion).  Lobster bisque was delicious (though the temperature could have been warmer).  The bread basket had some very nice selections - the brown bread was our favorite.  Husbands fish and chips were cooked to perfection with lots of extra \"crumblies\" along with the fried haddock and french fries that included some fried slivers of sweet potato and plantains to make the dish truly interesting.  My Halibut La Griglia with champagne grape sauce was topped with a generous portion of lump crabmeat and came with a side of saffron risotto, grilled asparagus and roasted tomato.  The halibut was cooked to perfection - moist and flaky and the sauce was not overpowering.  The saffron risotto had a beautiful flowery taste and the grilled vegetables were a perfect accompaniment.   Good wine and cocktail selection and service.  Definitely the place to eat downtown."}
{"text":"Would never go here again. Hosted a grp of 8 Professionals and wanted to try something different. Sadly disappointed - and food poisoned.  Summary of menu items tried: Coconut Shrimp: prepared from frozen and shrimp was not deveined (gross)!  Salad bar: Fresh, but far from interesting for the price.  Filet: totally unseasoned, tasted like boiled! Tough and chewy. Could not finish. Teriyaki Fillet Medallions: Sauce from a bottle from \"Safeway\". Very bad and chewy/tough.  Sea Bass: Wasn't sea bass. Was prepared from frozen, overcooked and totally unseasoned. Orzo reheated from yesterday with a \"skin\" on top!  Service: knew that 18% tip mandatory. Was TERRIBLE, inattentive and SLOW.  Only reason I paid the \"mandatory tip\" is because I didn't want to make a scene with all of my guests.    I am NOT HAPPY with the ripoff that the Chart House gave us tonight.  That waiter made over $80 in \"mandatory tips\"  from my bill.  I am blessed to have been successful in business, and I am normally pleased to pay my bills - but I worked very hard for my money and I hate being ripped off.  And the Chart House ripped me off.  Called Management later to complain about the low quality food and service. Will see what happens to be fair and will update this.  Manager on the phone said that he would \"inform corporate\" about our complaint.  Should note that two guests (the ones that had the Caesar salads) ended up getting very ill later that night.  The likely culprit is food poisoning from the Caesar Salads.  All in agreement (several of us are Physicians and Nurses)."}
{"text":"Not impressed :-/ we went to many top restaurants on our Las Vegas trip and to be honest this was our least favorite . It was just odd the location is weird and to be honest we were looking for more or a five star dining experience . The food was decent service was ok but atmosphere just not what we were looking for ."}
{"text":"We always visit the Chart House because we've never had to wait for a table and we always prefer to sit at the bar because of the bar menu.  I am a vegetarian so had a hard time finding something but I ordered a tomato salad and a baked potato... It was the best baked potato I've ever had!!  Coworkers had sliders, shrimp scampi... They loved it all!! Good service and good drinks. 5 of us spent about $300 including tip so it was pricey to just grab \"a quick bite to eat\""}
{"text":"Nursing home meets cruise ship ambiance, mediocre service, very good food.  Not a good value, despite the pleasant surprise in the food."}
{"text":"Not so great. I know what the Chart House is capable of having been to the San Diego location before. My guest had the braised short ribs which tasted like high school hot lunch pot roast with a sauce drizzled on top. Even the server said a lot of guests complain about it. The Oysters and the Menage soup were definitely the highlights and had I not dropped almost $200 on the meal, I would have scored it higher. I don't mind paying for a good meal, but I should have been blown away by my experience and it was lackluster at best. Service was mediocre as it took almost 10 minutes just to get greeted. 2 different managers walked by our table multiple times and never stopped once to make sure we had been helped (out water glasses were empty and the extra place setting had not been taken away so it was obvous nobody had greeted us yet). It felt like a typical Vegas restaurant that can afford to be crappy b/c they have a great location with a ton of tourist traffic. Too bad for them this local won't be back nor will I ever recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"My friends and I lucked up !!  It was our last day in Vegas and before we hit the road we stopped at Fremont DTLV, we wondered around a bit, and walked in a casino to use the restroom, at the same time  we were deciding on what to eat. We walked around the casino and the first thing I saw was this beautiful aquarium, one glance at the menu and we were sold, although the aquarium alone made you want to eat there .. The host was very nice, and our waiter was even nicer, I wish I could remember his name! Anyway I ordered the coconut shrimp and it came with 3 dipping sauces and every last one of the sauces were exceptional!! My friends were very pleased with their food choices as well. Now it's a absolute must to eat here whenever we are in Vegas .. Not to mention everything was reasonably priced!!! #Win !"}
{"text":"Came here with my three girlfriends for a drunk at the bar. Our waitress was Alexis and she was great. She was so fast at serving and everything tasted amazing! She also helped me out by letting me charge my phone behind the bar! I was on 1%!!!!  The bar is super cool - a huge aquarium is the back slash (no pun intended) to the bar, and was beautiful. I had 3 mojitos (I recommend the mango mojito!) and the \"calamari and friends\" plate. The seafood was delish. Such a large portion I could share! I will totally come back to this casino and bar next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had our wedding reception dinner here. We actually got married in the Golden Nugget and preceded the ceremony with our wedding party at the restaurant. It was very important in our minds to have a nice dinner after with all our friends and family. To start we had a party of 35, so their event planner said we had to choose a set menu. They sent us a few sample menus and were helpful in allowing us to customize the meat and poultry options.   They do not have a banquet room but were able to comfortably seat us.  Right off the bat I knew we had chosen the right restaurant. When we arrived 10 minutes before our reservation it was as if they were waiting for us, and other than our reserved seat the restaurant was filled. The event planner quickly sat us and a team of waiters and waitresses immediately started taking drink orders and bringing bread. Hors d'oeuvres came next: Bruschietta sliders, fried asparagus, and jumbo shrimp cocktail. I highly recommend all three. Soup and salad was next: the finely chopped salad was a pleaser for all but the pickiest, but i was pleased, and it seemed that the clam chowder worked well for the kids. Entrees we next: I enjoyed the 12oz. prime rib and it was absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly. My wife ordered the fillet mignon and it was also very delicious. Our other choices were sea bass and range chicken and everyone that ordered them were pleased.   For dessert we had the hotel make a wedding cake and The Chart House graciously facilitated us, we were able to cut and feed our cake to eachother right in the restaurant.  The service was top-notch and professional. The food was absolutely amazing and timely. They kept drinks flowing and quickly cleared the tables after each course. I was so impressed that my wife and I took my parents back the next night to thank them for picking up the 35 person tab.haha.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone and I already went back as a testament to that."}
{"text":"Although it's not my favorite atmosphere for a typical chart house this restaraunt continues to be my favorite for fish in the entire world! It's where I always want to go on my birthday when I am in Florida. My BF never orders fish and I talked him into it here and he was not disappointed whatsoever we can't wait to go back soon! Wish the one in Malibu was still opened"}
{"text":"I wanted some crab legs so we went to Chart around 12:00p. We sat by the fish tank which was more exciting than the food. I orded the Alaskan King Crab Legs about a pound and a half for 55.00 they came split but they were dry. My friend had the short ribs they were tender and off the bone. I had fried rice it was dry. We had the hummus which was my first time eating it and I will never eat it again. The service was good but the food not so much."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the view!    Ate here a couple of months ago and was very pleased with the whole experience"}
{"text":"We walked along this old part of Las Vegas and decided on a light lunch at the remodeled Golden Nugget. After exploring a bit we made our way to Chart House. What a lovely place for lunch. The huge fish tank is breathtaking. Like dining in an aquarium. Sarah was our server and she was prompt and very nice. I had a huge bowl of exquisite lobster bisque. It came with a basket of assorted warm rolls. My $9.00 lunch was one of the best meals I enjoyed on my holiday. Highly recommend making your way over."}
{"text":"Christmas day and my wife and I didn't want to make dinner. Our requirements for eating out: 1) no buffets and 2) it had to have a kid menu. After calling around and finding out that many \"good\" restaurants weren't kid-friendly we ended up making reservations at the Chart House, located in the Golden Nugget.  Walking into the lobby of the  hotel it was easy to spot the restaurant. Just look for the large aquarium behind the registration desk. The entrance to the Chart House is a small set of steps to the right of registration. There really isn't a hostess stand so if there's no one to greet you chances are you'll wander around the lounge trying to figure out where to check in. My first impression of the restaurant was that I thought it was going to be bigger. Sure, the aquarium looks cool, but I pictured something bigger with a much larger dining room surrounding it. The reality is that the room feels cramped and poorly laid out.  As far as the food, many of the seafood dishes were the weakest ones we tried. Isn't seafood supposed to be their specialty?   //Appetizers// - East meets west tuna: a duo of tuna tartare with a wasabi sauce and plantain chips and seared tuna with sliced avocado and cole slaw. It wasn't bad, but the slightly mushy texture made me think it wasn't the freshest fish around. - Menage Soup: three small cups of gazpacho, lobster bisque and clam chowder. All were good with the lobster bisque being the best of the three.  //Entrees// - New wave surf and turf: short ribs with a cabernet demi-glaze and seared scallops in a ginger soy sauce. The short ribs were fork tender and delicious but the three tiny scallops were gritty. - Alaskan king crabs: 1.5 lbs of steamed crab legs. My wife didn't like the taste at all. I didn't think they were that bad, but the quality definitely seemed to be comparable to crab legs at a buffet. - grilled chicken breast and fries. This was my kid's order. He was hoping for chicken tenders but had to settle for this, which turned out to be over cooked and dry. But he enjoyed the fries.  Our server was good. He was a slightly older guy who was friendly, very attentive, and even made all of us feel welcome even though we were the only ones with a kid in the restaurant.  I thought the place was a-ok. My wife, on the other hand, was extremely disappointed and couldn't wait to get out. Although her opinion may have been influenced by the fact that she used to work at a Chart House back east. I always liked the chain. They're not the fanciest places and don't have Michelin quality food, but for a chain you could do a lot worse."}
{"text":"We stayed at the GN for NYE and tried the Chart House Happy Hour before heading out to the street.  I had the fish tacos and my husband had the Ahi tuna nachos with an order of the plantain chips for us both.  Everything was delicious, including our drinks from the happy hour menu.    Even though the bar was full, they allowed us to sit at one of the booths on the side of the dining room and order from the happy hour menu.  Our waitress was attentive and pleasant even though we were only only ordering the appetizers on special and couple of drinks each.  I really enjoyed both the atmosphere and food and will most certainly return for a full dinner in the near future."}
{"text":"Strawberry Margaritas!  Whoot Whoot!  If you can find it, this place has the best Strawberry Margaritas in the world!  Well my world, that's all that matters.  There pricey I want to say about $12.00 for about a 10 oz   But talking about heaven!"}
{"text":"Went for my second visit on my last visit. It was restaurant week and we were looking forward to it! With great company in tow and hungry bellies we were off! We enjoyed our dinner very much. Those that had the Ahi Tuna app loved it! I had the New England clam chowder. It was a bit thinner that I would have liked but my other table diners loved it. The crab cakes were GREAT! Super chunky real crab pieces. The creme brulee for dessert was also really really tasty.   They seated us near the lake view so that was nice. We had fun and are avid seafood lovers. For a place meant for older peeps, this was a pretty good experience!"}
{"text":"Food is just outstanding at Chart House and its a great reason to go downtown to the Golden Nugget which looks fabulous after its major makeover a few years back. Service is also stellar, unlike most Strip and Downtown spots that are too tourist unfriendly. Always treated right here at the Chart House.  The big downer is the noise level. It's too clubby to begin with, but the large groups they get tend to really ruin the atmosphere. Be prepared if you are seeking an intimate setting.  The seafood is where it's at on their menu, but everything is just outstanding. The seafood tower and King Crab claws are excellent. Their beet salad is also expertly prepared. If seafood isn't your thing, their meat menu is par for the course compared to other steakhouse. Finally, preorder the chocolate lava cake, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Having lunch here midweek made me forget I had to go back to the office after.  Our party of four was seated by the aquarium and who doesn't love the view of an aquarium.  I had the clam chowder to start and for my meal I had the Diner Burger.  It was your basic restaurant burger and I enjoyed it.  Our table shared the Hot Lava Cake.  The Lobster Grilled Cheese looked good and came highly recommended so next time I will try that.  Service was excellent and timely.  Bonus, Oscar Goodman waiving as he walked by!"}
{"text":"Great food! Ordered the coconut shrimp and fish and chips, both were very delicious. Loved that there was a beautiful aquarium to looks at - not to mention this aquarium is huge! Many beautiful fish to look at and enjoy while eating your dinner.  The mango mojito was delicious :)"}
{"text":"Our server Nick gave great recommendations. The food was well prepared with some innovative twists such as between infused salmon crudo. They have a unique selection of craft cocktails, one even table side. The best ever habanero lime ice cream. The only negative was on the soups. The calm chowder was very thin and there was no actual lobster in the lobster bisque; the flavor was there but no lobster pieces."}
{"text":"Our favorite part was the gigantic fish tank! We spent most of the dinner checking out all the cool fish, and there was even a giant yellow eel. Downside was the food wasn't very exciting. I had the scallops and they didn't have much flavor, and they were absolutely drowned in pesto sauce. I like pesto, but I should be able to taste the seafood first and foremost. The server didn't really leave us alone. I would suggest just going for a cocktail and checking out the sea-life."}
{"text":"It was my friends 1st trip Vegas so I wanted to introduce him to the Fremont Experience. So before I showed him that I brought him here for dinner. We were seated in front of the aquarium, which was great. Our waitress Julie service was outstanding from begginning to end. I told her my he is from NY and a Vegas virgin, so she helped me surprise him with a NY cheesecake surprise after dinner. Loved the intimate ambiance, and adult setting. The food was good, great presentation. He's still talking about this place lol. Pretty sure he's going back."}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience here last night. We had a 7:45 reservation for 4 of us. (Me, my husband, 2 year old and 1 year old) we got sat at 8:20. They were visibly behind, and the hostess was running around like crazy, but 1/2 the restaurant was empty tables. So not sure if they were short staffed or not. We finally get to the table. We are all hungry, and a little flustered for waiting so long, especially with little ones. Waitress came to take our drink order and we stated that we had already looked at menu and were ready to place our order. She returned with my drink, and my daughters drink, and 2 glasses of my husbands drink. We instantly thought that was probably a sign that she would not be returning. She brought us no bread, which would have been nice to distract my children with. After about 10 minutes she did return with bread, by this time I had drank my iced tea, my water, and my husbands water. She brought no refills. Our food finally came. My steak was ordered medium, it came medium rare, at max. I told her I wanted medium. She took it away, and told me I shouldn't have cut it up because they're going to throw a hat on it and quick cook it, I responded that I don't want it burnt. The manager returned with my steak, and then pointed out that my husband had 2 full glasses of his lemonade and I have nothing to drink, my steak was undercooked, and now it's charred and still rare. She asked me what I wanted, with quite an attitude. I said I came here to eat, and the entire experience has been terrible. She asked if I wanted my steak, I said no. Everyone at my table was done eating by now, she said she could get me coconut shrimp out fast, so I agreed to that. She returned a few minutes later with that, she then asked someone to get me a refill. Overall the shrimp was good, but I'd never return. Cooks can't cook and management can't manage. Steak pictured is after it was sent back, and cooked more, and charred."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here often.  This is the only place we go to for steaks, they make it the best.  We enjoy the atmosphere, the views and the staff is always good to us.  Always a good time here."}
{"text":"Wow. What happened? We had good experiences here before but this last time was awful! We came before our reservation so we could have drinks in the bar first. 4 of us... waited 15 minutes to be given a menu. Slow service. Drinks and apps were good, though.   Asked front desk if our table was ready (we had told them we were there) 5 minutes after the reservation. Still not ready. Said it would be 15 minutes! Got us in to a nice table in 5 minutes, however. Waited forever for menus AGAIN. Very slow service.   The chopped spinach salad was delicious, the macadamia topped fish was overcooked, steaks were average. Everything took so long, even to get a water glass refilled or another beer. The explanation was that servers were new and that there was a \"17 top.\"  Sorry, you need to be prepared if you have a large group coming in. Won't return unless just for happy hour."}
{"text":"Only in town for one night and stopped by the Chart House.  They were packed, but, as a Landry's member we were given priority seating and the wait was only four or five minutes.  The dinner was prepared perfectly and the service was great.  There were two large groups of more than 15 people that were being served when we sat down and we were concerned that the groups would consume the servers time.  The staff had time for both groups and all of the individual tables."}
{"text":"Today was our 16th Anniversary and I wanted to do something special for my fantastic wife so i live in Chicago and we planned on coming to Vegas so I booked reservations on line and explained it was our 16th Anniversary. Long story short. They treated us like celebrities, gave us fantastic seats with a special menu printed for us wishing us a happy anniversary. Our waiter Tony was like our best friend who we knew forever. We will go back. If you go ask for Tony's section.  Food is a bit pricey but was so worth it. I had the 14 ounce Lobster Tail and my wife had Filet Mignon.  Our appetizer was their cold seafood tower .  DELISH. I highly recommend.  Oh, and they wrapped up our menus in a bow and gave them to us.   Very special night."}
{"text":"There were 4 in our party and we ordered the Prime Rib, a NY Steak, Filet and the Sea Bass. There wasn't one thing that was worth the price attached to it and I'm not even sure the Sea Bass was really Sea Bass. The asparagus were decent but for a $300 meal I except more than just a decent side. I will not return and I don't suggest you ever go. Save your money and literally go anywhere else."}
{"text":"The food is always incredible here but what made this visit amazing and pushed me to do a review was our waiter Harris. He provided outstanding service that exceeds the average dining experience. He was attentive, polite, helpful, and very nice. I highly recommend this restaurant for a night out in Vegas and if you can I would definitely recommend requesting to be seated in Harris' section."}
{"text":"A must try for special occasions. Try the espresso martini and the calamari. Best in town! Nice view, older crowd...probably because of the prices. Yummy food though. The Macademia Mahi seems to be a crowd pleaser and the crab stuffed tilapia is quite delicious!"}
{"text":"A typical seafood restaurant. Everything was good, just not great. I had the Caesar salad and it was pretty good, well dressed and I enjoyed it. Then I had the scallops with saffron risotto and the flavors were there but the portion was really small for almost $40 I expected a bit more. Service was attentive and the fish tank is nice but nothing really special."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and the comfortable lounge chairs. We came for Happy Hour. The food was delicious. Definitely try the calamari! For only $6 you get a huge portion. Great deal on drinks as well. We loved it so much we're going back tomorrow night. Our waitress, Skylar, was super sweet and attentive. I've see  other reviews about a tall blonde providing poor service, but Skylar (who is tall and blonde) was fantastic. Definitely come here for happy hour from 4-6. The dress code is slightly above casual FYI."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. I had the shrimp trio and it was delicious.  The lava cake is to die for!!! Our service was fantastic. The manger hit every table making sure everything was perfect.  It was a perfect special occasion dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood dishes, would recommend the Maize shrimp and scallops. Beautiful views. Sit toward the back by the water. Travis was an excellent server! Thank you for a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"The waiter I had at this restaurant was absolutely awful. I had a party of 10 on a slow night. For our soups and salads, he forgot my soup, but brought everyone else's. whenever there was food left on someone's plate, or if they weren't finishing a drink fast enough for him, he would very awkwardly ask if we did not like whatever it was. This would be an okay question to ask maybe once to someone at our entire table if it truly looked like something was wrong, but he asked this question to every person at least once. He was overall just very awkward and provided bad service.  When the food came, I was surprised to see that the plate was very dirty. The fish did not taste fresh and made me feel sick."}
{"text":"Chart House reminded me of every restaurant out in AZ that Ive been to for work purposes.  A huge restaurant cranking out the same meal 90 times a day over and over and over.  Needless to say I still enjoyed coming here.  There was a great view with tons of wildlife all around the lake.  I saw a bunny, pegged some bread at some geese in the lake, and fed the coi fish there too.   The menu again was preset so I didnt really get the full experience of dining here.  But I loved the first date mood lighting enjoyed by me and my training instructors, quite romantic.  The servers were wearing industrial construction gloves to handle the food which was really quite disturbing..."}
{"text":"Went here for a New Year's Eve dinner with a meet up group.  I don't know where the seating went wrong but we could not all sit together.  Granted we were a group of 30.   But we should have been advised of this beforehand as the whole idea is to meet up and visit with the entire group.  I ordered coconut shrimp at a price of $29.00.  It came with three sauces which were nice and the  sticky mango rice was tasty.  There were 5 or 6 shrimp that were also good, but not over the top or lots of food.  One person in our group had a well done filet which the server suggested she have fileted because of the doneness.  She took that suggestion however one side of the steak was burnt.  We asked for water, that never arrived.  We requested steak sauce and it was brought in the bottle, not in a sauce dish.  As this was toted to be upscale there were disappointments.  Another person ordered a filet medium and it was definitely medium rare.  It was sent back and cooked some more and it still wasn't right and there was not any mention of a reduction in the bill for this error.  I would not go back.  This is acceptable for Denny's, not upscale."}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant - it was a place we chose late at night for dinner because we were far from our hotel, needed something to eat, I wanted something healthy and the menu looked like it had something for everyone in our group.   I'm glad I did - it's easily one of my new favorites in Las Vegas.  My friend ordered the chopped spinach salad  for $10 w/  bacon, egg, radishes, mushrooms, warm bacon dressing.  It looked delicious and she really enjoyed it.  I ordered the Chopped Salad for $8 w/ cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, radishes, hearts of palm, pepperoncinis in balsamic vinaigrette and the Wicked Tuna for $17 which came as ahi tacos, tartare & pepper seared.  It was a huge serving and was displayed well.  I was happy with it.   Service was fairly decent but we did wait a long time to place ordered, get drinks, and get the final check.  We sat late in the evening and it was about 1.5 hours and none of us ordered anything of any particular length of cooking time - like steak - so it was a lengthy meal.   But for the cost, the ambiance with the fish in the glass aquariums all around, freemont street, and healthy menu options - it's a big win for me.  I can see us coming back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Randy was our waiter. He really seems to love his job and that translated into a great experience for us.  Kudos to him, Thanks for the great time!"}
{"text":"Omg!! Yummy!!! Love the short rib!!! The DESSERTS!!! Lava cake was was delicious! The Creme brûlée is a must!"}
{"text":"I thought the views were fantastic, however I was very disappointed with the service. I had to ask twice to have my water filled and gave me my steak without a steak knife and walked away. Again I had to hunt the staff down and interrupted my experience. The steak ended up being tough and not juicy. For the prices that I was paying for the food I just expected top notch service and never got it. Views were awesome, but I recommend skipping this restaurant and go to Outback and save your money!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place for Restaurant Week last night and ended up walking out!   The hostess was rude, sat others before us even though we had a reservation, and did not give us Restaurant Week menus.  Then the waiter seemed \"put out\" when we asked for them.  My friend had a bug in her water and asked the waiter for a new glass...he took it from her without an appology and when he brought her a new glass, said \"here ya go\".   Maybe it was an off night for the staff, but we will never go back to find out."}
{"text":"I was expecting more here, than what was available. We were pretty much all alone with a party of 12 on a Monday evening at 8PM. The server Nick was great, had that Vin Diesel look going. His attention to detail was impecable.  When we first arrived of course we went to the bar, and we all sat comfortably as we waited for the rest of our party. Our bartender was a dead ringer for Dennis Farina. The drinks were perfect, not too much alcohol and not watered down. We then were sat, and then ordered our meals. I had the lobster bisque which was very tasty until I got some dirt in my soup. It happens, but it did put a damper on the overall feeling. I then ordered the Filet and Lobster tail. I should have gone with the Prime Rib instead. The steak was a bit overdone for me, maybe having sat just a bit too long, and was really quite small for me. I think it was only a zix ounce portion. The lobster was done correctly. I also had the sizzling mushrooms, and to be honest button mushrooms on a sizzling fajita plate just didn't do it for me.  The service for me is what made this a three star, not the food or the ambiance."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner at the Chart House. I had their Lobster Bisque, one of the best in Las Vegas, and Blackened Swordfish again absolutely delicious. My date had the Grilled Swordfish and she felt it was the best she had had in along time.  The services was perfect. The waiter was properly attentive, not overbearing and did not disappear as some do.    We will be back and look forward to trying their other dishes."}
{"text":"Great birthday dinner! For sure a 5 star! Atmosphere was great. Food even better! Lynnette was awesome waitress! Don't miss the Halibut, & go for the chocolate dessert!"}
{"text":"The service is great. The cocktails are superb. However, I went for the food, and for the cost, I found it disappointing.  The crab cakes were awful and tasted like they used canned crab. The server was great about it and immediately offered to replace it with something else or take it off our bill. The manager on the other hand seemed a bit offended by my dislike of the crab even though I highly complimented the halibut.  I'd go back for the bar, not the food."}
{"text":"The last time I'd been to the Chart House was when I was 8 years old, but at the original location in Aspen, Colorado. It's everything I remember it to be.   It's a restaurant you plan on going to--a \"special occasion\" worthy place. This location is no exception.  Expect upscale dining in a gorgeous setting. Be sure to make a reservation and ask to be seated by the windows.    The waitstaff go out of their way to ensure that you are having an enjoyable meal.  The maitre'd even comes by as you near dessert to introduce himself.    The fare is mostly fish and beef. I enjoyed the seafood grill: Asian glazed salmon, shrimp scampi, and a jumbo-lump crab cake with Yukon gold mashed potatoes and asparagus. I devoured every last bit of fish on my plate.   One highlight of dining here is the salad bar. Yes, the salad bar. But it's different--it's the Chart House salad bar!!!  Order an entree and for $8.50 you can enjoy unlimited caviar, fresh fruit, cold salads (i.e. pasta salad, potato salad, artichoke heart salad...) and traditional salad bar items. Or, for $16 you can make this your entree. Savor this. Go back for seconds. And thirds. Maybe even fourths.   I wasn't expecting our entrees to come out so fast. 14 minutes to be exact, the waiter informed us...a little too fast for such a high-end restaurant. I prefer to savor my salad bar items. Linger a bit before the big show, if you know what I mean.   Toward the end of the meal an inebriated party of four was seated next to us. What a scene. When you're paying top dollar and expecting a pleasant dining experience, the last thing you want is drunkards offering to buy your table shots. Completely uncalled for. I know it's not the restaurant's fault, but they shouldn't have seated them in the first place. It's not a sports bar--it's the Chart House!"}
{"text":"Went here for my wife's 40th Birthday. The prime rib was delicious which is what I had. Wife ordered the filet mignon. It was OK. I've definitely had better. Place is nice. Had the oysters on the shell for starters, wife said they were delicious and very fresh.  Service was really good except the Upsell was kind of heavy with the recommendations/desert/join their \"steak\" club. ...heavier than normal. Didn't really care for that."}
{"text":"I have nothing but praise for the Chart House. For one, our waiter (I think Jeff) was totally on point. He was on his game all night. Secondly, when I made the reservation, they asked if we were celebrating anything... I thought it was just a common question, but no! They put \"Happy Birthday, Mercedes!\" on the menu! All 4 of our menu's had that message on the top. What a nice, personal touch. Now the food... oooooooooooh the food. I wished I had 4 stomachs so I could eat it all. The lobster bisque was sooo tasty, so was the gazpacho! For my entree, I had the filet mignon with sizzling mushrooms. Everything was delicious. My mom got the stuffed shrimp and let me try - that was also incredible. And the pomegranate mojito tasted like candy!! I would definitely come back to the Chart House again!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Steakhouse and Seafood restaurant in Fremont, Las Vegas (Downtown). The Chart House located inside the Golden Nuggets Hotel. Rated top 9 Winners Restaurant Restaurant in Las Vegas.   Beautiful interiors designed from Flooring: Jade Tiles, new trendy leathers interior to Modern Light Fixture. The most Restaurant attractions is \"The Hugh Live Fish Aquarium\" next to the cashier. It is absolutely marvellous Looking at the large Aquarium. It is truly admired Aquatic experiences and feelings.  We ordered the Seafoods platters, Steaks, with a side of mushrooms, Red Wine. The foods was delicious. It only cost about $120. We had left-over take out. We had a great dining experience and atmosphere too. The restaurant was really comfortable and cool with the casual seating/booth, Life sized Aquariums. The Staffs/Hostess/Servers was helpful, friendly and cheerful."}
{"text":"Chart House was never on my radar.  I used Yelp to find a place to have dinner before the book club meeting and up popped Chart House.  It turns out that I've walked by it a number of times and never knew it was a restaurant.  I only thought it was a bar/lounge.  But, behind that large fish tank is another side and that's where the restaurant is.  I was seated promptly right along the glass of the fish tank.  It's a great place to sit because you are almost constantly watching the fish swim when you're not eating--eating seafood even.  I wonder if anyone would like an enclosed, sealed calf range in a steak house.    My server was Haley and she was good.  She took my order after answering a few questions.  I was brought my iced tea (blackberry, bottled Republic of Tea) and a runner brought some bread and butter.  The bread was OK.  The rye roll was good.  It was brought warm.  The flat bread, soda wafers were quite dry and not as good.  For a started, I ordered the ménage soup.  It's a trio of small cups of their three soups--lobster bisque, gazpacho, and clam chowder.  The gazpacho was hands down the best.  The clam chowder was good.  The lobster bisque was average.  For the main course, I got their spicy yellowfin ahi served with a ginger soy sauce and wasabi cream and accompanied by wasabi mashed potatoes.  The ahi was cooked very rare--just seared and off the grill.  It was excellent and the wasabi sauce was very good.  The wasabi mashed potatoes were also very good.  For dessert, I had ordered the hot chocolate lava cake.  The menu states to leave 30 minutes prep time for specialty desserts and when I was ordering dinner in the beginning, Haley asked me about this.  I ordered the cake then so there'd be plenty of time to make it at the correct time during my meal.  The cake was excellent.  Chocolate goodness topped with Heath bar crunch and vanilla ice cream.  The meal and service were very good and the fish tank is lots of fun.  It was a hoot watching the people watch the fish.  The tank is 75,000 gallons and has dozens of fish.  Haley told me that a diver is in the tank daily for cleaning and feeding.  The only drawback was that I was at the first table in from the lounge and some of the happy hour people were quite loud when they got some alcohol in them."}
{"text":"Spent Memorial Day weekend in Vegas with a few friends and we wanted to grab lunch before heading home. Stumbled across this little gem while exploring Fremont street. The beautiful aquarium is what reeled us in. The server and yummy food sealed the deal! I got the lobster grilled cheese and red sangria. All of us were 100 percent satisfied with our meals and plan on returning next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went to the Chart House with the wifey a bit back to celebrate our 3rd year Anniversary!  Anyone who can be married to me for that long deserves a nice hunk of beef (her 2nd...if I'm considered her 1st...heh heh heh)!  Located in the Golden Nugget near the hotel registration.  Looks pretty unassuming on the outside because the restaurant is rather open-spaced and housed with a LARGE salt water fish tank, no real sign, only way to tell for sure is the menu stand posted near the steps!  Walk up the steps to find the host/hostess, you will notice that the front of the restaurant is all bar and lounge type seating.  The real restaurant is around the fish tank to the back.  Chart House, there you are!  For our Anniversary we were given a more intimate table for two in the corner directly facing the fish tank.  What a view!  Our reservation also came with personalized menus for the two of us, celebrating our Anniversary on top!  Nice touch.    Our server was excellent, super friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable on the Chart House menu!  She even knew we were celebrating our Anniversary!  After ordering some drinks and perusing the menu, our server led us to some great recommendations for dinner.  For a light appetizer we ordered the Hummus Trio - classic combination of traditional, roasted red pepper, and edamame (yes, edamame!) hummus all served with grilled pita and plantain chips.  Delightful!  Thankfully the hummus seemed to be fresh made (hopefully in-house) and was ripe with Mediterranean flavor.  Good quality olive oil, fresh beans.  The surprise was the edamame hummus, it was delicious.  Fresh, refreshing, light, it went great with the plantain chips.  I could eat a huge bowl of the stuff by myself.  I highly recommend.  For dinner the wifey and I went with what else?  Meat!  Chart House Prime Rib 10 oz. cut to be exact.  I asked our server if I should go with a bigger cut because you know, I'm a bigger dude, but she suggested that with the smaller cut the meat would be slightly more tender.  She was correct!  The 10 oz. cut of prime rib was no slouch, it was really a good size portion.  But the flavor was WOW!  Succulent, tender, salty, peppery, overall yummy piece of meat.  The extra au jus on the side was a nice addition as well.  I always (yes always) ask to my better judgment if there is a house steak sauce.  Yes, in a good steakhouse, this is sacrilege!  Our server, being gracious said they don't have a house steak sauce, but A1 if it's necessary.  But she did say to please trust them when they say the prime rib doesn't need any sauce.  Thankfully she was right.  Prime rib was juicy, oozing with fatty flavor!   Cooked perfectly for my liking.  A touch of horseradish, a smatter of au jus, and I was set.  Yummville, population - ME!  Our prime rib also came with a serving of Yukon Gold mashed potatoes.  Buttery goodness!  Creamy!  Did I mention the extensive use of butter?  For an additional side we got the Asian Green Beans.  They were tasty, but nothing I couldn't have created at home.  Fresh green beans, stir fried with soy sauce, sugar, possibly some rice wine or mirin, topped with sesame seeds.   Can't go to a fancy place like the Chart House and not try a dessert!  OK, if you're a diabetic I guess you can.  Wifey and I topped off the evening with their signature Hot Chocolate Lava Cake - chocolate cake with a molten center consisting of Godiva liquer.  Then it's topped with chocolate sauce, Heath bar, and vanilla ice cream.  Whoa!  Talk about punch to your gut!  Luckily I saved some room by getting the smaller prime rib cut.  This dessert was rich, rich, rich!  Chocolate everywhere.  Cake was warm, and the molten center was divine.  Heath bar added some great texture, and the the vanilla ice cream helped to cut through everything.  Piggy us, we finished it up!  Lovely evening celebrating our Anniversary, after dinner we lounged in our booth and took in the fish tank sights.  Just relaxed and relished the rest of our night.  We must have been there an extra 30 minutes, and our server was more than polite and told us not to rush at all.  Rather enjoyed that.  Chart House, overall no complaints.  Wait...bring in a house steak sauce!  Nah, just kidding.  Keep up the food and service, and I'll be back.  Save me some prime rib."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times. Sometimes just the hubby and I and other times with friends. Although it can be quite busy, we've never had a problem being seated in a timely manner. If you get the chance, sit by the huge aquarium. It's incredible! The food is excellent and so is the service. The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star review are the prices. They are a little steep."}
{"text":"We decided this would be a great place to get our families together for some good food, and good wine to help us celebrate our engagement and we were not dissapointed.  Not one of us had one bad thing to say about the food we ordered. It was one of those nights where we all just had a great time enjoying each other's company and eating off each other's plates and tasting some delicious wines!  We had great service while we were there! Our waiter even took the time to get us all together to take a picture to commemorate our engagement dinner!  We will definitely be taking any company who comes to visit us here for dinner! Definitely a great experience!"}
{"text":"We made reservations for a family get together.  It was everyone's first visit at this location. We picked the CH because we figured that out of all the restaurants in Vegas to choose from, it was a guaranteed safe bet that everyone in our family would be satisfied.  The setup this location is very nice.  It has a beautiful aquarium that can be seen throughout and the tables along the wall were more than accommodating for our large group.  We had two of the best waiters (Paul and Edward) you could ask for.  They were very knowlegeble of the menu and knew the details of how the food choices would be prepared.  Also, can't forget their fun factor.  They joked with us and fit in like they were family all while providing excellent service.  Everyone enjoyed their food and experience at this location.  I definitely recommend and will be returing the next time I'm on this side of Vegas."}
{"text":"Always pains me to give this good of a review to a chain but Chart House  held up thier end of the bargin. I showed up with my 3 year old daughter early for our 6:30 reservation. They offered to seat us at our table or a nice lounge booth. We chose the booth quickly served us a Corona and Shirley Temple with Extra cherrys. My daughter thought the Corona was perfectly chilled:) We were seated in a timely manner when the rest of the party arrived. They had no issue with a partial order so we got app's in. Ordered the 2007 Willamette Valley Vinyards Pinot Noir. Waiter came back with 08 he didn't notice the difference. Once I brought it to his attention he offered a Cali Pinot that was slightly more expensive. I stuck with the 08 it was still  good pretty light but the second half of the bottle opened up and had a little better finish. Apps were great Spring Rolls, Avacado crab mango stack, and Prosciutto-Fontina- rocket -balsamic- sliders. They were all great but those Sliders were the Belle of the Ball.....Damn tasty!  Entrees were two Blue cheese filets, one Fish-n-Chips(I just had a craving), and one kids menu Co Co Shrimp. Steaks were cooked right with plenty of bleu and carmelized onions. Fish-n-Chips were a little disappointing not entirely crisp and the chips was a melange of fries, plantains, and other random stuff. The CoCo Shrimps were a big hit with The Bean. All in all a solid dinner in beautiful setting(Love the huge aquarium)"}
{"text":"House takes tips from waiters then charges you again. Be sure to check your receipts. When we arrived we had  a menu with prices on our table. One of the managers promptly took that menu off the table and gave us a new menu with the same items at twice the price.  We had attended a time share meeting at Diamond Resorts and they had given us a 100.00 gift certificate for attending. They said they would make the reservations for us which they did.  This is why the Chart House switched menus as they  figured we had an extra 100.00 to spend. We will never go back to this place. The waiter was great but very embarrassed for the menu switch.  He didn't want to get into trouble about this issue so we paid cash, shorted the restaurant and gave the waiter a cash tip in his pocket. I wonder how many people attend those time share meetings and never know the prices have been jacked up."}
{"text":"I visited on a Tuesday evening for a 6:45 PM reservation with a party of 10 = 1 toddler + 9 adults of which 5 of them act like toddlers sometimes. =)  I was excited to visit because of other friend's previous visits and the Yelp reviews.  Service: 4.5/5 Our waitress was fantastic from beginning to end.  She kept checking on us as the food kept coming for our party and handle our party of 10 easily.  She explained how we can surf and turf our dinner even though it wasn't listed on the menu as an option.  We were celebrating a birthday that evening and they personalized our menus with a Birthday greeting for the celebrant.  Great personal touch we loved  Food: 2/5 The brown bread in the bread basket is excellent, very tasty with butter.  The Iced Seafood Tower was very good.  All the items were fresh and I loved the Tuna Poke. That was my first time seeing poke in a seafood tower, good stuff.  The lobster bisque was disappointing.  Very thin and not very tasty but the pieces of lobster in the bisque was plentiful but couldn't save the bisque overall. My friends were clowning me for ordering a filet at restaurant known for their seafood but I had seafood the other day and figured it'd be fine. I ordered the 9 oz Filet Mignon (medium rare) topped with the Mushroom Truffle Butter and I was unfortunately disappointed.  The filet was bland and the truffle topping was too buttery.   I split the Fried Mac & Cheese and while visually pleasing, the cheese utilized tasted something similar you could buy at a grocery store off the shelf.  My friend who shared this side with me agreed. The key lime pie was a very big slice and was very good.  Highly recommended.  I ended the night with a Baileys Coffee drink that wasn't tasty due to the quality of the coffee.  On a positive note, my friends who ordered the fish dishes were pleased.  I had another friend who ordered the prime rib medium rare and he mentioned it was tasty and cooked perfectly.    Value: 2/5  Overall for me, it seemed like the ingredients used for the dishes were not of the quality I would expect from the prices charged for the dishes.  However, the presentation of the plates was visually pleasing in design and presentation.  Ambiance: 4.5/5 There's an amazing aquarium at the entrance with so many different types of cool fish to see.  The tables, seats and silverware were high quality and the table and booths were spaced perfectly.    Summary: As a Vegas local, there are so many great food options in the city and from my first experience here they seem to be behind the curve in terms of what is offered for price and the quality of food received.  If I happen to visit again I'll most likely check out one of their seafood entrees or the awesome prime rib my friend had.  The staff was fantastic and definitely enhanced the dining experience."}
{"text":"I admit it's been awhile since I've eaten at the Chart House. A couple years, I think, and my significant other took me here on a packed Valentine's Day afternoon.  What I recall is the steak, which he ordered, not I.  There was this dipping sauce, melt-in-your-mouth butter concoction that gave the already flavorful, soft steak an even greater kick. The ahi tuna was also tasty.  Being from Maryland, I appreciate a good riparian view. Atmosphere supersedes food for me at times. Chart House was right up my alley (not that their food isn't equally on par with the views).  A thumbs up in my book."}
{"text":"The staff at The Chart House in the Golden Nugget is excellent the Sea Bass and Halibut was excellent but I would never order the lobster Bisque again, I love Lobster Bisque but this maybe rated a 2 out of 10, if your looking for rich flavor of good Bisque don't order this. When I leave a half bowl you Know it's bad, Campbell's soup would be better."}
{"text":"Setting in a beautiful location, beautiful view but the food and service were OK.  We came for dinner In a large group of 14 people and I had kale & roasted butternut squash salad and coconut crunchy shrimp, it was OK.   The coconut shrimp came in a giant wheat/rice flour chip bowl with lots of deep fried wheat/rice noodles and it was a bit oily for my taste. The salad was way to over dressing and I ended up couldn't eat it. Was a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"The Chart house use to be the standard in outstanding cuisine entertainment. That was back in the 80's. This location is a gold mine, but unfortunately the menu and attitude is still stuck in the 80\" s. Proven, the average age for happy hour is 70;+ when it should be 35+. Management should consider a promo like Aloha Friday's outside overlooking the like with a Hawaiian combo and BBQ, u would pack them in. Leverage the outside patio, not the dark inside bar."}
{"text":"I was treated to dinner here a couple days ago while attending a convention in Vegas and this restaurant was a very pleasant suprise. I didn't look at the prices on the menu so keep that in mind.   The atmosphere was cool and the joint was busy. Our server was outstanding. The calamari with friends was awesome with fried bell peppers and jalapenos mixid up with the perfectly battered squid. The caesar salad was rfg and my rare-medium rare filet was spot on."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Golden Nugget, which has been completely re done. The pool area is sick, but let's talk food.  We went here for dinner and to start off we got the Calamari, which was different they any other Calamari, it was more like tempura, which veggies and other deep fried items along with calamari  Next my wife and I split the Clam Chowder, i wish we didn't i wanted it all to myself. But i know we couldn't take anything home so i didn't want to be stuff for dinner, but the Clam Chowder was great. I would almost say award winning  For dinner i got the Seared Chilean Sea bass one of the best Chilean Sea bass ever, the risotto was cooked to perfection and the lobster and jumbo lump crab was just the icing on the cake. The Sea Bass didn't have a fishy taste and just fell apart with the fork. I'm getting hungry just writing this.  My wife got the Miso Glazed Salmon she loved it, i tried a bit, but i felt that my dish was so superior that her dish just tasted ok. But my wife had the same passion for her dish as i did for mine.  Even if you are on the strip this place is worth the drive just to eat here."}
{"text":"I stay at Golden Nugget almost every time I go to Vegas and I haven't had the opportunity to dine here until this past  August.  In fact, I didn't even notice that it was a restaurant.  There's a huge fish tank and I saw people sitting around but I always assumed it was a lounge.    I had the raw oysters to start and they were delicious.  The presentation was very pretty and I was a bit skeptical because when dishes look pretty, they don't typically taste too good.  But that wasn't the case here.  I then moved on to my trio of soups which was also very good.  My main course were the scallops and I substituted the starch for fried rice, which came in the shape of a pyramid.    Overall the service was great, the atmosphere was great and the food was delicious.  Now that I know this place exists, I'll be back more often!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and a 70,000 gallon fish tank that is mesmerizing. went twice on our 4 day stay it was so good! Had the blackened Prime Rib, lobster bisque, fried mac & cheese and chop salad. Wonderful! A must try."}
{"text":"Yes the tank is cool. We enjoyed very much sitting right up against it while we dined. I had some kind of Mojito and my wife had some sort of cucumber martini. Both were delicious. We started with the mushroom appetizer. It was amazing. We usually don't eat much bread before a large meal but we ate all the bread mostly dipping it in the sauce from the appetizer hence by the time we were done dessert was not going to be an option. My wife had the fried seafood plate and I had the crab legs. We always share. The crab was well presented as were the sides. The lightly fried seafood was so fresh and delicious as was the dipping sauces. Yum. Our waiter was awesome. It was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"First time at Chart House. Went specifically for the Chilean sea bass, also first time having this. OUTSTANDING in every sense of the word. Our server Hoda was the best. Attentive but not over bearing. Loved the whole experience. Will defiantly go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Excellent service! Excellent atmosphere! If you have a special occasion or you wanna drop a buck on dinner, your time and money will be well spent here. It's 5 star dining all the way. Go ahead and splurge, you're in Vegas! Let them know ahead of time if you have a special celebration and they will print up special menus for you. I cannot say enough good things about this place. Everything is so good!"}
{"text":"So this place has a bit of odd history for me.  When I was back in high school, this guy would always promise that he would take me to the Chart House is Redondo/Hermosa Beach if I ever gave him the chance.  Well, I never did, but then I started dating a guy and he took us here for our...wait for it...one month anniversary.  I know, totally lame, but when you're in high school one month seems like a ridiculously long time!  So we go there all dressed up and looking cute, and we don't even make it to the bread because my date is puking in the bathroom.  The waiter thought my date abandoned me because my date was with me for all of two seconds.  So needless to say I didn't get the full Chart House experience. Fast forward to 11 months later, and he takes to the one in Scottsdale for our one year anniversary.  The food was delicious and the setting was as cute as it can be for living in the dessert.  We even got to see the geese kick the ass out of the ducks for food that was laying out there.  This place is a standard, upscale, romantic restaurant.  I like more off the beaten path places, but this place is always a safe bet."}
{"text":"We actually dined here two consecutive evenings, with different views of the fish tank and different dishes on each night. We had the same server, who was good, and enjoyed ourselves each time."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I don't think this was our servers fault entirely, but everything that could have possibly been wrong with a dining experience happened at this place.  I have never been to another Chart House location but I have been to other Landry's restaurants with mixed results.  This place however was one of the worst experiences I've had in a long time.   My girlfriend and I came here because it was down the road from the hotel we're staying at and they offer 1000 point reservations on Open Table.  We had reservations at 8:45 at night so I guess maybe they were wrapping up for the night but for the prices they charge I would expect the same level of service anytime they are open. We were seated and our server Joe took our orders promptly.  We both ordered dirty gin martinis and bread was brought out promptly afterwards.  We also ordered oysters when we place our drink orders.  After a good 10 minutes we got our oysters which is reasonable for an appetizer order, but still no drinks.  After eating all of our bread and starting to eat our oysters we were still left without our drink orders.  Finally after I would say was 15 to 20 minutes we received our drinks.  I ordered my martini with blue cheese stuffed olives which weren't available at the time so he brought out regular olives until they could be made which was fine.  However he made my martini completely different from the other martini (it was made \"perfect\" which i guess is equals part gin and vermouth).  He did ask if I wanted it remade and I said I would give it a try since I didn't know how long it would be until I received another drink.  During this time it looked like he was the only server left on with 4 tables left to serve so I am not sure if this was the servers fault or the bartenders in regards to how long it took get my drink but that long of wait and to have it come out wrong is inexcusable.   And that was just the drinks.    We place our orders for dinner and I ordered the large cut of the prime rib and the salad bar while my girlfriend ordered a side caeser salad and an appetizer.  I went and had the salad bar which was actually pretty descent.  I would even go as far as saying the salad bar was the highlight of the meal but I can get that at golden corral.  I proceeded to eat my salad since at this point we probably there for 30 minutes and at that point only had just received our drinks and had bread and oysters.  I finished my salad bar plate and my girlfriend had to wait another 10 minutes before receiving her salad.  The entire timing of how they brought our food was pretty poor overall.   After finishing our salads, they brought out our entrees.  I ordered the 18oz prime rib medium rare and my girlfriend ordered an appetizer that had raw ahi tuna and tuna tartare.  Her food actually looked somewhat appetizing and was somewhat tasty.  My prime rib however was nowhere remotely close to be cooked medium rare.  I understand I ordered a large cut of prime rib but it was brought out almost 90% well done through out.   I'm not sure if at the time of plating it was cooked like that or it had sat there for a while and thats why it was so well done but it no way is it ever acceptable to bring out a cut of meat so far from what you ordered.  It would be one thing if maybe it was medium or medium well but this was definitely well done.   At this point I almost was going to tell the server to not even bother to bring me another one because again I had no idea how long it would take to receive my food again.  I brought it to the attention of my server and he assured me it shouldn't take very long since it was medium rare.  It was brought out shortly after and the prime rib was close to medium rare.  It was OKAY.  Nothing to write home about.   In the end we received our bill which was $128, which would be just fine for a descent meal somewhere but for our experience was not even remotely worth the money.   Our server was nice enough but i think he just didn't have support from managers, bartenders, or the kitchen.  Overall I would say this was one of the poorest restaurant experiences I've had in a while.  I would say avoid this place like the plague.  Too bad because it is convenient location with a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best view for Sea Food! Drinks were made exactly right and the lobster bisc was delicious.  Went for my four year anniversary and the mood was great here."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place for lunch since I've heard their other locations have such great seafood. When we saw \"lobster grilled cheese\" on the menu we expected great things. But it was just okay. There was minimal lobster and very little cheese. The best thing about the dish was the lobster bisque it came with to dip in. Just an average meal"}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant.... until last Sunday, $235 dinner and the prime rib was a plate full of blubber ... asked for medium rare and it came out as a LEATHER BELT .. sent it back and next one was medium rare yet ZERO FLAVOR... the manager didn't care one bit nor did laundrys company's complaint even get me a phone call or email with concern...  anniversaries for our entire family and special occasions have been here for 17 years now ... yet they just tossed me away as a patron... UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY THERES OTHER PLACES IN THE VALLEY WHO DO A BETTER JOB FOR LESS MONEY NO DOUBT .... a month later and no contact from the ch regarding my complaint ... NICE JOB"}
{"text":"We stopped here on a whim to kill some time on Freemont street.  The huge aquarium caught our eye, and we liked the bright ambiance with all the glass stairs and bar tops. The servers were attractive and friendly, and mixed a good drink. We ordered a hummus tasting platter to go with our drinks.  3 kinds of hummus and pita and plantain chips.  Pretty good stuff.  A pleasant way to kill an hour and $40 :-)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. . 10 stars.. I ordered the 14 oz cold water lobster. It was delicious..i would have added a little more seasoning. . My spouse ordered The mixed seafood dinner and it was the yummiest.  The crab cake was 150 stars..  My sister ordered The stuffed flounder and it was very good.  I was so impressed with every dish.. I will return to this restaurant.   Service was outstanding. ."}
{"text":"Diamond in the ruff!   I've been to a lot of Chart House restaurants before, so when I saw this one at the Golden Nugget, I thought, heck, why not...And oooo let's sit at the bar cuz the fish tank is so freaking cool!  We ordered: Calamari, app: fantastic. Crisp, delicious and this sweet chili dipping sauce was absolutely amazing. Little fried pieces of jalapeño and bell peppers complimented it perfectly.  Fried asparagus, app: delicious. It had this hollandaise with it that was awesome with it....whole fried but still tender spears of asparagus. Yummy!  Ménage soups: sampler of three soups. OMB (b for Buddha...I'm buddhist!)! definitely the highlight of the meal! Trio of lobster bisque, clam chowder and gazpacho. Bisque was rich and savory yet light....like a soufflé almost. The clam chowder had huge fresh chunks of clam and potatoes. And the gazpacho....wow. Fresh fresh fresh, delicious! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!  Spinach salad: beautiful presentation. But bland. Nothing special.  Seared scallops: overcooked, bland and unimpressive.  Filet mignon with blue cheese: delicious tender meat, topped with melted blue cheese and an oniony demiglaze ....absolutely delicious. But we ordered medium and got medium well.   Bartender, Caroline, was very attentive even though she was super busy.   She even made a drink we wanted and was on it step by step! Some bartenders won't even make this drink...super chavelas!  The wait staff that aided her were lax, lazy, slow and had an air of rudeness to the bartender. I didn't appreciate that at all. Spoke to the manager, Michael, to that regard and he was an even bigger douche than the servers!  Great apps, soups and steaks....awesome bartender, breathtaking view of a huge fish tank...everything else was mediocre at best.  Would I come here again? Yes....too bad the wait staff and manager suck."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for Valentine's Day.  I was a little concerned because it is inside the old Nugget Casino and I thought it might be a little ratty.  Boy was I wrong.  I guess they have completely redone the place because it looks incredible inside.  The restaurant itself was amazing as well.  Our salads were great, the crab-mango-pineapple appetizer was to die for, and our entrees were quite fresh and delicious.  Really pleasantly surprised at how good the seafood was.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here for Christmas and was seated next to a pole when there was so much open space they could have rearrange the tables completely differently. The food was mediocre at best and my table had to return two of their for being under cooked.  We waited what seemed like forever for our waitress to simply get our drink orders to which she way over hyped what the bloody Mary's were and said that there was basically a salad on top. When we receive them it was an olive and a pickle. A small olive and a pickle. Forgot to take my boyfriends order... seriously has just gone so downhill!  I remember years ago this being a great place, but with all the new amazing restaurants all over the valley do not waste your money on going to this restaurant. The service lacks and forgets about it's tables, the food is not very good, and there was no ambience and no Christmas music and no thought put in for the patrons. Also having the salad bar right next to the open kitchen where I saw some rather disturbing activities."}
{"text":"Birthday celebration, our waiter Mike made it very special.  He was so attentive and helpful, almost as if we were his only table buy we were not, he was just THAT good!!! The view was amazing, the food was awesome we had 2 appetizers, 3 cocktails, 2 main courses of fish and 1 dessert...so yummy..all of it..but truly, the best part of our dining experience was Mike, HE WAS OUTSTANDING!!  Thank you Mike for making my birthday!!"}
{"text":"Had not been to the Chart House in years, food and service was 5 stars ! Went with a group of friends form our local leads group , in Chatsworth Ca, we started with apps. Shrimp kabobs, Mac & Cheese, salad yummy ! Main course for me was Seared Ahi on mashed! Everything was done to the 10ens ....  I would go back, and I would tell a friend !"}
{"text":"Despite the spider on my table and me flying accorss the room.... So embarrassing. And the waiter pretending like he didn't see it when he first came to the table he moved things around at the salt and pepper but didn't think anything of it until the spider crawled into my appetizer plate.   The food was excellent. Got off late last night and wanted something really good to eat they close the kitchen at 11 pm but they kept it open  a little bit late for us."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Try to get a table near the glass and watch the divers."}
{"text":"Aside from the gorgeous panoramic views, really I don't have anything great to say about this place. You definitely pay for style over substance here. Waitstaff eh, food coldish, felt rushed. Honestly didn't know what the fuss was about except the views. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great food!!!!  We had reservations with our vendor here and the food was so good! They offer a salad bar, but I had to pass it on it. A few of the others had to check out the caviar on the salad bar. I was eyeing the lobster bisque and maize shrimp and scallops. The food was good! I did wish the dish had spice, but that's because I like spicy dishes.  The other guests with our party really enjoyed their dishes. The desserts looked good, but I was too stuffed from dinner. Our servers provided awesome service to us. Nobody went without anything. The view here is beautiful. Who doesn't like to see mountains in the background with cactus and palm trees?! Thank you for the awesome service and good food."}
{"text":"Everything you want for a superb dining experience you will find here.  From being greeted pleasantly, to being seated promptly, to attentive and quality table service, to the most delicious prepared fresh food in a meticulously clean and mesmerizing environment.  We sat at a small table right next to the beautiful tropical fish tank that was full of some of the most beautiful fish I have ever seen.  The waitress was extremely pleasant and knew everything she needed to answer our questions about the food and drinks on the menu. I have never had Chilean Bass before but it was just out of this world.  Chilean Bass blackened with the Baja topping was simply amazing. Oh and the trio Mojito's for two has now become my favorite drink, the Mango was our favorite, you must try.   It's not often you go out to dine and everything is perfect.  This was perfect.   Thanks for such a wonderful dining experience I will be back."}
{"text":"I could say much about this restaurant but I'll keep it to a few things.    First off I want to say the staff is accommodating, knowledgeable, and professional.  Their know of both wine and food was on par with an establishment that is world class.    Secondly I would like all to know is the food, especially the sea food, is what it is supposed to be.  Simple, the items spoke for themselves and were not masked with too much spices or marinades.   The aquarium is impressive.  It is clean,  healthy looking fish and very active.  One thing that isa bit confusing is that there is a tv playing sports constantly hung on one of its walls.    Lastly I will say the wine list was phenomenal and the staff knew the protocol on how to pitch, serve, and refill.  Staff was well educated and trained,  a rarity in this time and age.    This is being critical but one must know a few things that don't make this a Five Star experience.  I will say the noise level is a bit too high for my liking.  Also,  there are no rest rooms located in the restaurant so one has to circumnavigate the casino floor for refreshing and relief."}
{"text":"Well the center peace of the restaurant was definitely the fish tank. Seafood tower was a great start, enjoyed the crab, & the spicy tuna, the meal was good, had the Chilean sea bass was light and cooked perfectly, my wife enjoyed the Encrusted Mahi-Mahi, a Freind had the whole fish which was picture worthy, we split the chocolate lava cake wasn't as amazing as it looked unfortunately. Good meal neat atmosphere"}
{"text":"The Chart House - Las Vegas  The 5 of us hadn't been together since the Costa Rica trip in 13.  Moonshine had a hankering for golf, cigars, gambling and hookers and he wanted his friends with him. With Moonshine, myself, Montana (he's Cuban...you'll figure it out eventually), Jericho and Sissy (named as such because of the larger then normal sissy bars he puts on all his motorcycles) in tow we all loaded up in Nova's van and headed west. Now I know what your thinking, Preach, why not fly?  Flights to Vegas are dirt cheap.  I hear ya but every since the NDE Montana experienced in the prop plane when flying into Key West he refuses to fly, thus the road trip.  Pussy.   Moonshine set us up at the Golden Nugget because according to him the \"payouts\" in downtown Vegas hotels were far more generous then those on the strip, as are the ladies. Personally I'd prefer the El Cortez but this was Moonshines trip.   We arrived after 10pm, already behind schedule and pissed off because of the frequent stops as a result of way to alcohol consumed and Sissy's abnormally small bladder. Now before you launch into the evils of drinking and driving, all of the driving was done by Jericho and myself as we both drew the short straws. No laws of any consequence were broken during this road trip. At least while the vehicle was in motion. Fine, I lied. I may have had a Stroh's or two.   After a stop at the Commonwealth and thanks to Jericho, time in the \"secret\" bar it was back to the Nugget and a visit to the Chart House.    I never knew this place existed, probably because my normal diet when in Vegas consists mainly of  wings and Bloody Mary's from the Parlour, plus prices to eat at a place like the Chart House leaves me with a lot less for roulette and professional women. Chill, Nova's fine with sharing. As a professional woman herself she gets it.   Dinner consist of coconut shrimp (this ain't Margaritaville for piss sake), lobster & shrimp spring rolls, stone crab claws and calamari for appetizers. The calamari was useless, tasteless and basically nothing more then breading and paled in comparison to the other appetizers. The stone crab was meaty and damn delicious. My dinner consisted of Lobster Bisque which could best be described as creamy liquid sin and Bronzed Swordfish. My fish was perfectly cooked and it came with a side of fried rice which I'm sure came from the closest Chinese buffet...yeah it was that exciting.  The actual highlight of my meal, and loved by all of us was the side of creamed spinach I ordered. God damn delicious. Throw in drinks and I lost count of the number of bottles of wine we killed and our bill exceeded 1K. Shine didn't bat an eye when presented with the bill...rich bastard.   The Chart House is not my kind of place. Although the food was good and in some cases very good, in my mind it's the kind of place you take someone when you are trying to impress someone which I could give a shit about.  However, just because it's not for me doesn't mean shit and I've got to give it high marks  based upon the servers who were outstanding and very attentive, the food which was superb based upon the oohs and aahs of those with me, the atmosphere which is cool as fuck and the fact that it personally cost me nothing. Thanks Shine.   4 stars"}
{"text":"We went to Chart House on February 8, 2108. Our server Lawrence was extremely attentive, polite and friendly. He made a great recommendations. We started with Caesar salad and calamari. Woow it was delicious. I had the red snapper. OMG It was AMAZING!!!  Highly recommend this place. We will be back!!!!  Thank you Lawrence for making our visit enjoyable!!!"}
{"text":"Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Heavenly! Absolutely dug in like a champ here! Could not resist the enormous fish tank. It's beautiful and I was able to snag a seat right beside it. Floor to ceiling! The server, Randy, was so cute, friendly, and helpful explaining the menu. I started with some insane app. A tower of thinly sliced and wrapped avocado was the base, then a layer of roasted corn and mango salsa, topped with lump back fin blue crab. This thing was easily 5 inches tall! Then a dozen oysters, all so fresh!! And I tried their Maui coated in crushed macadamia nuts and roasted on top of a bed of mango and corn salsa and beautifully prepared root veg. I wish I'd gone here sooner I would have eaten here every day!"}
{"text":"My dad and I were staying downtown for the first time and wanted to try out a place in the area for dinner. Chart House did not disappoint! The food was all good, not incredible. My grandpa always said that if the food is okay and the service is great, you will still come back. That is how I feel about the Chart House. I cannot remember our waiters name, but we were amazed. We go out to eat at least once a day and have been to tons and tons of restaurants around the world, and my dad even said the waiter was probably the best he's ever had. The guy should definitely be working somewhere on the strip, maybe even at Twist in Mandarin Oriental or something. To the Chart House waiter with the great beard and awesome customer service, you were incredible! He gave great recommendations and we enjoyed our meal. Will be back just for the service! Great experience overall."}
{"text":"We came in for an impromptu dinner, completely sloppy from house hunting all day long.  Their hostesses and waitresses were nothing but accommodating and polite, and they didn't make us feel bad for our appearance.    We ordered salads (garden salad was just okay, caprese salad very good) and filet/lobster with a side of mushrooms.  I thought the veggies were just okay but the mashed potatoes were great!  Also, the mushrooms were very good.  The steak was just okay but the lobster was delicious, some of the best  I've had recently.  So if you go, I wouldn't recommend surf and turf, just go for the seafood straight up.  We got one of their special heated chocolate desserts--it was just okay, we probably should have passed, seeing as how we were so full and it was mediocre, but we were celebrating!  We got a table right next to the tank and it's really cool, to sit next to and for pictures.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I have to give chart house a 4 star review because consistently it makes an unbelievable macadamia nut crusted mahi and the King Crab legs are fantastic.  There is no need to use butter for these legs for they are of fantastic quality.  I always add the salad bar becuase it's a good start.   And the Chocolate cake is worth the wait.  The lobster spring rolls are a really good appetizer.       Now, I haven't ordered anything besides the above items so I can't comment on steaks, cx, or other fish.  The location is nice with great views of camelback....it is a desert but let's be honest, it's a neighborhood in a major metropolitan city."}
{"text":"A wonderful evening.  Dinner was perfect, but I always expect that from the Chart House.  Our table overlooked the lake and it was just beautiful.  The staff could not have been more attentive. My meal was perfect as was the beautiful red wine I was drinking.  Hope to go back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Walked into the Chart House in the Golden Nugget and got a table right beside the Aquarium, which was magnificent. Ordered the Oyster appetizer, very fresh and good. For entrees my husband had the sword fish, grilled, delicious and beautiful presentation. I ordered the King crab legs, they came sliced open and a pound and a half, really great, worth the money. Our waiter was also fantastic."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best Ahi Tuna I have ever had. My partner's Mahi was unbelievable. We started with Duck Pot Stickers- WOW! We finished with a chocolate Godiva filled cake. We cannot remember what it was called but it was GOOD. /atmosphere was great and the service was tops as expected. We will return."}
{"text":"The Chart House restaurant is one of those rare finds in the high stakes restaurant business in Scottsdale. Instead of the kitschy, music pounding, over the top environment, you are welcomed into a classy restaurant where the goal is allow you to relax and enjoy the dinner experience rather than being overwhelmed by it. The hostess immediately welcomed us and immediately sat us with a view of both the outside fireplace and the lake. Our server Kelly immediately made us feel welcome and ensured that our drink order were placed and that she was available to answer any questions. Her super customer service continued throughout the evening.   We started with the Chart House chopped salad and the special tempura shrimp rolls. The salad was extremely fresh and crisp with wonderful made-in-house dressings. The tempura shrimp rolls tasted good but had a rather thick tempura crust and had to much rice compared to the amount of shrimp. Two of the party had crab cakes for dinner which filled with lump crab and were very tasty. The other member of the party had the prime rib which was a generous portion, perfectly cooked and great taste especially with some fresh horseradish. Unfortunately we didn't have room for desert since we would have liked to have tried their signature lava cake.   Bottom line a great experience both in terms of customer service and food but they could have done a bit better on the food (e.g. lighter and more shrimp for the shrimp roles, etc). However all around very much worthy of another visit."}
{"text":"Awesome Happy Hour drinks and appetizers. Chart House has one of the BEST lobster bisque in Vegas. Must try their Lobster Francaise - it's AWESOME!! Featured wine DeLoach Pinot Noir 2013 was outstanding - great price...ordered a couple bottles. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The WORST seafood in Las Vegas. Sorry, but mushy head on shrimp are NOT fresh and the chopped salad was as if it had been made the previous day and let to sit in its own juices.  Back to basics guys!"}
{"text":"Decent little place to grab happy hour if you are Downtown. This review is only of the happy hour sitting in the lounge area.  The HH menu is pretty good for a group of people to order off of, although not everything is really shareable. My group just asked the server which would be best to share and she obliged.  Hummus was great - three different styles (traditional, red pepper, and edamame), but I wish there had been more grilled pita. The addition of plantain chips for dipping was very nice!  Spinach & Artichoke Dip - Meh. Not very good, and a small portion (the dish is very shallow!). Plus there were just a lot of fillers on top of the dish, making it hard to get to what you actually want - the spinach and artichoke dip, of course!   Lettuce Wraps - Comes with seared chicken, cucumbers, carrots and a soy sauce glaze. These were OK - but the lettuce was a bit wilted when it came out making these a bit less appetizing than they should have been.   Chart House Sampler - This one is a weird one, and you'd think it would come with more than just a few items considering it is called a \"sampler\", but the portions were kind of meager and the lobster/shrimp spring roll (1) is not good for sharing.   My group also imbibed on numerous drinks (I did not), but they looked delicious and were decently priced.  Bonus - make sure to sit in view of the fish tank and watch the colorful fish swim in the glass tube of emotion. (Ron Burgundy...)"}
{"text":"Great location. Fine, not excellent, food. The oysters were phenomenal, but the special entree was disappointing...expensive and disappointing. Excellent drinks."}
{"text":"The Chart House has been a restaurant that has been around for ages (nationally), and unfortunately, it's starting to show.  This seems to be a place that has \"grown\" with its clientele -- those people who come here are the same families that have been coming for years, but are now bringing their children and grandchildren.  There is nothing wrong with that (my family has its faves), but I might just be too late attempt to add another.  As such, the Chart House, while perfectly picturesque and with decent service, just isn't a culinary star in Scottsdale.  More specifically, my wife and I ordered the coconut shrimp and the blue-cheese/panko crusted asparagus for appetizers.  Admittedly, the coconut shrimp was a \"throw-away\" dish -- it's our go-to at Outback, and we had a craving.  The asparagus was a bit different, but enjoyable -- it wasn't pretty, but it certainly had us talking about it as the high-point afterwards.  The macadamia crusted mahi was simply so-so.  While not bad, the fish wasn't flaky and the sauce (peanut something-or-other) was so heavy it masked the mahi flavor.  My wife's ceasar salad had 3 croutons in total on it -- not a deal breaker, but it seemed pre-prepared.  But the one thing that customers need to know, the prepared cocktails (at ~$10 a pop) and really light on the pours and even lighter on the flavor (e.g. pineapple caipirhana) -- we couldn't justify getting a second drink with the entree.  We had high hopes for this place (we had been to the one in San Diego years ago), and unfortunately, it would not be a place we would actively choose to go again.  That being said, we wouldn't say \"no\" if someone really wanted to go.  In our estimation, it was simply an overpriced so-so restaurant.  If it weren't for the lovely view, I think our night would have underwhelmed completely."}
{"text":"\"The food was good not great and a lil over priced!! The best part about our dinner was the aquarium!!\""}
{"text":"Our dinner at the Chart House tonight was excellent. Paul was our server, and he knew the menu inside and out. I have never had seafood prepared as perfectly as these guys did it. Scott's blackened fish was his perfection, and my swordfish was as moist and juicy as I have ever had it. Crab cakes were incredible, and the chocolate lava dessert left us craving more. Great job, guys..."}
{"text":"Lived in Vegas for almost 6 years now and finally had the meal that beats all the rest. Went in on Friday before the Jamey Johnson concert and had a spectacular meal. Started with the seafood tower for 2 and what my wife called the best clam chowder she ever had--we're from New England so that's saying something/I had sea bass/she had shrimp trio/side of mushroom risotto. PERFECT, everything was PERFECT.   Had an issue with my second pour of Herradura reposado (think they tried to pull a fast one so returned it and got a Sculpin IPA in a bottle).   Harris was the best--very energetic. Our server was so/so, seemed disinterested.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Love scottsdale location with the  view of the lake, service is wonderful, very elegant,  the food was not great,  disappointing, and very pricy for what they offer."}
{"text":"OK seriously, our reservation was at 6:45 this evening and we're still sitting here and they tell us it's going to be another half an hour before we get seated. they are understaffed here at the bar and nobody's paying attention to us I will never come here again"}
{"text":"The aquarium is amazing 5 stars. Food was meh and quite expensive, the local Outback is actually better and cheaper. It was very loud and we were tucked away in a tight corner booth next to the server station and a round 6 top that waiters kept sqeezing by and bumping into to get pitchers of water. Our waitress was sweet but couldn't remember a thing to save her life. Definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped in after Bingo with some friends for happy hour and some munchies.  I ordered their signature drink, which of course I can't remember the exact name now, but I attached a pic. It was ok. I wouldn't really order it again.  Then I got the chips and dip, which were homemade potato chips and green onion dip. This was delicious and I would absolutely order this again. Lastly, we got the pan seared scallops which did not disappoint.  The bartender was super friendly and the atmosphere was cool.  If I'm ever in this casino again, which is not very likely, due to location, I would stop in this place again for their happy hour!"}
{"text":"We visited the Chart House for my 30th birthday. As Vegas locals we were wary of a restaurant downtown, but once inside we completely forgot we were in a casino. The aquarium was amazing and kept my 9 year old entertained the entire time. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and one staff member even took my daughter to go see the moray eel in the tank.   The food was very good, not the best I've ever had, but very appropriate for the prices. The calamari and ssanjang shrimp appetizers were delicious, the baked stuffed shrimp was amazing, the prime rib was adequate, the ahi was great, and the fish and chips was perfect. The soufflé wasn't my favorite, mainly due to the texture, but the chocolate lava cake with the house special peanut butter swirl ice cream was to die for.   The staff really made this place amazing and made our experience one of a kind. Our server was so friendly and attentive. They also gave us specially printed menus wishing me a happy birthday along with a card signed with all of the staff who helped us. The atmosphere is pretty loud but that was perfect for our boisterous party of 8.   In all, I would definitely recommend this place, especially for a celebration or for a romantic date out. Just be sure to make a reservation and request a seat next to the tank."}
{"text":"Maybe they were short staffed, but ate here for the first time last weekend and wasn't impressed.  Hostess and wait staff weren't attentive and very slow...for the price of dinner for two, I expected more.  Food wasn't that great either.  We had crab claws, sword fish and scallops.  Didn't taste very fresh...Have had much better at this chain else where.  Atmosphere was 5 stars...fish tank is amazing.  Will give them another chance in future in hopes that food and service will match atmosphere next time!"}
{"text":"Shrimps and scallops were very good!  Nice waiter and very good food! We loved the choice of wines our waiter recommended. (Cabernet)   Cheese plate was big enough for party of 6!  Kim Chee caramari was great."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been wanting to try the Chart House for a long time. We finally made it there on Oct 6 for lunch. In the lobby of the Golden Nugget but secluded with a great entrance design. We were seated next to the two story aquarium which was great. Our server was profressional and pleasant. My wife had the shrimp linquine and I decided on fish and chips after the server said they were the best in town. Both dishes were superb. The fish and chips could be the best I've ever had anywhere. We were sincerely thanked at our table for coming in by the manager and he also handled a small problem with our Landry's Club card (caused by no internet connection, not anything to do with Chart House) by simply handling it the old fashioned way, pen and paper. A great experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to check this place out for restaurant week, so we went last night. First off, they have a table right next to a stairs with high traffic, so I asked if we could be moved, no problem at all.  So, our wait person introduced himself as \"Bucky\". We looked at menu and then asked for the restaurant week menu, as we had never eaten there before.  Appetizers were okay, main dish was very nice and the deserts were nothing to write home about. Here's my biggest issue.  \"Bucky\" is as useless as tits on a bull, unless your at a table with 4 or more people, I guess he thinks bigger tip. Not one time during start to finish did he ask if  everything was okay. Terrible terrible service, he's in the wrong profession. Because of our experience, we won't eat their again or recommend to anyone. I had a better experience at a Jimmy John's"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a nice Valentine's dinner at Chart House before heading across the tracks to The Smith Center. I chose this place because of its proximity to our show and because the girlfriend used to eat at the Portland location all the time. I guess it's tough to top a view of the Willamette, but the gargantuan aquarium that anchors the Vegas spot is a sweet feature. We were at the end of the tank and with the way the glass curved, watching the fish sometimes felt like a 3D movie.  We started our evening with a couple of cocktails. I had their version of a Bold Manhattan. The girlfriend had the Downtowner. The Manhattan was enjoyable but very sweet. I preferred the Downtowner (and indeed ordered my own).  As for food, we thought everything we ate was great. We shared the Roasted Beet Salad to begin our meal. The fact that they split it up onto two plates was a nice touch. Not quite as spectacular as we've had before, but excellent nonetheless. For the main course, I ordered the Bronzed Swordfish while the girlfriend chose the Tour de Shrimp. We accompanied that with their Asian Green Beans and Gorgonzola Risotto. Everything was well-cooked and well-seasoned. No complaints whatsoever. And the plentiful leftovers were just as delicious the next day.  Ever since I saw Superman II as a kid, I always wanted to eat a soufflé but just never got around to it I guess. So it was a must that we tried their Chart House Soufflé. It was much too sweet for me, though the server did warn us about that. Luckily, the Grand Marnier Crème Anglaise complemented it perfectly. You're supposed to choose a sauce, but the server allowed us to have all three on the side. The raspberry had a nice tartness to it that also helped break up the sweetness of the soufflé.  A note on parking: It seems like you now need to stay at the hotel or dine at one of their restaurants in order to get validated."}
{"text":"This place sucks. It's so expensive but quality of food and service is not worth it. They have a good drink and appetizer menu so maybe only go for those things."}
{"text":"Amazing seafood restaurant. Great selection of food and the staff was great. They have an insane tank in the middle of the restaurant with beautiful fish and one creepy moray eel.   I would love to come back here!"}
{"text":"One of our go to places when in Vegas. Food was great, service excellent as always"}
{"text":"As I was told by most people... DT has it going on for a lot better and cheaper than the Strip.  I was taken  here for the seafood and the amazing fish tank.  The fishes were lovely.. ranged from Nemo, unicorn looking, zebra looking, and cute looking fish.  My companion was lovely company.  Service was impeccable and waitress was lovely.  She even gave us a free dessert.  This is what we tried: - Cold platter:  Amazing.. we asked if we could get it for one person and we were able to get one lobster tail, one crab leg, two oysters, and two jumbo shrimp.  Fresh and delicious. - Lobster bisque:  probably the best I have had in a while.. very good and lobster meat inside! - Swordfish.. delicious and flaky - Fried platter.. probably not as good but my fault.  Best part was the lobster tail.  Fish wasn't that great..  - Calamari wasn't that great with the kimchi sauce.. wish they had marinara. - Drinks.. I liked the pomegranate martini but I wasn't that wowed by it.  Went back to the Manhattan.  Would definitely visit again.. very romantic and great date place."}
{"text":"This restaurant has just slipped by me all these years. We had late evening reservations for a party of 7. We arrived while it was still light out so we were able to see the view of the water. Shortly after it got dark but a monsoon storm rolled in giving us a spectacular light show. Our server Joshua was super efficient, friendly, good with the children in our party, and pretty funny too. Each entree was more than enough for each of us, and every one of us enjoyed the taste and presentation. Not a single complaint and wouldnt change a thing. I know Chart House has been open for years and I hope they stay open for many more!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the food. The prices were top of the line and the food was mediocre. The $19 salad bar had brown and wilted lettuce, yellow broccoli, and 4 dressing choices.  The ambiance was very casual for a $40 per entree meal which did not include sides. I will be spending my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This restaurant is unbelievably over-priced for the quality of the food. In fact, we assumed that it was the 1st week of the semester for the culinary school at Scottsdale Community College and that new students were being tested on their cooking skills in the kitchen to assess what they'd need to learn in the coming year. We concluded they'd need to learn a lot if that was indeed the case! The setting overlooking a lake is nice if you are seated such that you can see out. The place has a men's clubby gestalt to it. It was so moody (e.g., dark) that every single patron we saw with a menu had their smartphones out with the flashlights turned on to read the small font, lightly printed offerings.  The only tasty dish we tried was the chopped spinach salad. The baked, stuffed shrimp was over-cooked and slightly charred. The grilled tilapia was much too over-salted. And what they were calling a shrimp \"scampi\" (a very specific set of ingredients and flavors qualifies as a scampi) absolutely was not; rather, it was a gluey, tasteless interpretation of an Alfredo sauce on a large pile of linguine with a not excessive number of small-medium-ish sized shrimps. Because the scampi was misrepresented, the one of us who ordered the stuffed shrimp was long finished with their meal before the replacement for the 'scampi' dish, a tilapia came out. That meal then had to be eaten alone also.  We were charged the full, exorbitant prices for the dishes we ate. No comp for the inconvenience of having to eat separately after looking forward to a special dinner. No comp of a dessert. No apology. In fact, the waitress and whoever came out to respond to the situation (he didn't identify himself...) both acted as though it was our fault that their food was ill-prepared and inaccurately named.  Chart House needs to hire decent chefs at this place if they're going to charge the prices they're charging. All I could keep thinking while trying to eat these dishes was, \"What would Gordon Ramsay say?\" Believe me, it wouldn't be printable here...."}
{"text":"This place is great! We sat right along side of the large fish tank that's in the center of the restaurant. It was so cool watching the fish swim right next to you. The food was excellent! We had duck confit spring rolls for an appetizer. The lobster bisque soup was delicious. The Lobster Francese is a must have- the pasta that came with it was tangy, a perfect compliment. The lobster is also great prepared this way- a nice change from just dipping it in butter. The stuffed flounder is also amazing. This is a great place for a romantic date!"}
{"text":"My husband and me decided to drive from San Diego to Scottsdale for our 8 year wedding anniversary! We usually stick to Ruth Chris for special and intimate dinner dates, however, we decided to try the Chart House. First, let me say something nice, beautiful scenery! Now let me be honest, the food was horrible!!! For the price (which would not have been bad if the quality was there) we expected at least Ruth Chris middle range quality, however, we were disappointed with the luke warm clam chowder, soggy overcooked asparagus, wilted vegetable salad bar, bland fish entree, and bland and small shrimp with scallops entree. I guess the initial red flag should have been soon after we arrived, and received our initial cocktails, about 15 minutes later, we asked the waitress if it is common to offer a bread basket, her response, \"um, sometimes we do, it just depends if someone wants bread, would you like some bread?\" By then we had been sitting for more than 20 minutes and were hungry and ready to order our food, plus, who goes to a restaurant and \"has\" to ask for bread, they usually force it on you! Next, when our entrees were delivered we asked for tabasco because the food was so bland, she actually brought us a teeny tiny bottle of tabasco, you know, the size that they give you at a hotel when you order room service! Finally, she asked me if I wanted fresh pepper with my clam chowder, it was extremely bland, so I said yes, well, she disappeared and did not return until I was halfway through the bowl! The waitress knew that the service was horrible, so before she brought the bill, she sent out a complimentary dessert. Not all was bad, the next day we went to Twin Peaks Bar Grill, and we had the best experience, customer service was awesome, drinks were good, and the bar food was better than our Chart House meal!!"}
{"text":"BUYER BEWARE. Please pay cash when eating here. The service was extremely slow - I left a 10% tip which was probably too high - then Maggie, the server added another 20% to to check that I have disputed with Amex."}
{"text":"I think this place is going down hill as now they are only offering two seafood dishes which are wild caught the rest are farm raised which is very unhealthy and bad for people.  Also they are still serving clam chowder which is can based.  They did not have any specials last Friday night and said they are not offering nightly specials any longer.  The free range chicken was bland and boring and the chopped salads we ordered was nothing special.  The beef is still not organic or grass fed.  Wanted to order the Key Lime pie but this pie is not made in house but rather store bought.  Not a very good way to go for one of Landry's restaurants.  Very over priced for the quantity and quality of food.  We did enjoy feeding the bread to the ducks afterwards....We will not be back thought we would try again after a few years but they are going down hill.   Nice views..."}
{"text":"First, the location is beautiful overlooking a lake.  The service and ambiance are first class.  I had prime rib that was succulent.  I was pleasantly surprised that they have a salad bar, including cesar salad prepared by the chef.  The bread and crackers they bring with the salads are noteworthy, too.  The dark brown rolls tasted homemade and may have been pumpernickel.  Three of my compatriots had fish entrees that they enjoyed.  BTW, have a margarita.  They use fresh squeezed lime juice and make their own simple syrup.  In addition, they use a premium tequila.  Without a doubt, THE BEST margarita I have ever had!"}
{"text":"The Chart House made our 5th Wedding  Anniversary so special.  My husband and I visited the Chart House last year for our anniversary and had a delicious meal.  We were talking about it all year.  We naturally made a reservation for this year.  My husband made a note in the reservation that it was our anniversary.  We were treated by the hostess and promptly seated at a table for two right next to the fish tank.  Amazing view.  Edward was our waiter and incredible helpful and personable.  We had the poke as an appetizer and it was so beautifully played, I had to take a picture.  This was my first experience with poke and I will certainly have it again!  It filled all the flavor and textures I could want.  For dinner my hubby ordered the Tour de Shrimp and it consisted of coconut shrimp, stuffed shrimp, and shrimp with a chimichurri sauce.  He ate every bite!  I had the sea bass.  It was so perfectly cooked!  Fresh and flavorful.  During our meal the executive chef came by to see if everything was to our liking and it certainly was!  Then the manager came by with an anniversary card signed by our entire waitstaff!!!!  I couldn't believe it!  THEN, Edward presented us with menus that were made just for us and it said Happy 5th anniversary!!!!  I was blown away.  The topper to the whole night was when Edward came back and gave us a complimentary dessert of a peanut butter pie with a cookie crust.  My husband and I left there feeling like celebrities.  I have never had this level of service and I can't thank Edward and the staff at the Chart House enough for making our 5th anniversary as memorable as our wedding day."}
{"text":"While this Chart House does not have the amazing view their Dana Point or Lake Tahoe location has, the HUGE fish tank does make an impressive back drop for a wonderful seafood meal. After sharing appies, our group endulged in everything from Scallops to Steak and all agreed it was a great meal. My scallops each sat on a bed of their own wasabi mash potatoes. I can't stop thinking about those man mash pototoes!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful experience.  We came here on our last night.  It was storming and rainy out.  The setting by the water is lovely and the views are very tranquil.  Lots of ducks swimming and really pretty ambiance.  Our waitress, Lindsay, was wonderful!  Recommended items, shared her favorites and was able to clearly articulate why she loved them. Very personable and engaged with our table to the point she shared pics of her kiddos with us after we inquired before we left.  She was awesome!  We started with clam chowder and lobster bisque.  It was all hearty with meat and delicious.  We then shared coconut shrimp and crab stuffed shrimp.  The coconut shrimp is a favorite.  The Thai chili sauce with it is a fabulous combo of sweet and sour and spicy.  Delicious!  The crab stuffed shrimp is tasty and more savory without being too heavy.  It was also wonderful.  We ended with mud pie and key lime pie and s round of decaf coffees. The mud pie is enormous and more than enough for a table of 4.  We way over ordered.  Everything was wonderful!  Based on prior reviews this is a hit or miss spot.  We hit a solid five star experience and would recommend asking for Lindsey if you want fabulous and attentive Service.  Our experience here was fabulous and we enjoyed the entire evening.  Service, food and ambiance!"}
{"text":"I travel often therefore I eat out quite a bit  This place is grossly understaffed and thus the servers have poor attitudes.  It was 75% empty by the way.  I felt they made it clear they didn't want customers so I obliged them and simply left.    I'm very easy going...I can't remember the last time I did that.  If you want to enjoy a meal for your money, go elsewhere.  It seems the staff would appreciate it if you did."}
{"text":"Came for Happy Hour on Friday Sept 26.  We were seated promptly.  The waiter took our drink order, then returned ten minutes later.  We ordered a few happy hour appetizers.  We asked for some bread & butter while we were waiting. He advised us that b & b is usually not served during happy hour but he will make an exception & bring us some (really?). The appetizers came out but not b & b. Although, a few dollars less expensive during Hh, they were bland.  The waiter returned after we were done & asked  if we would like another round of drinks but we declined. Still waiting for the b & b. Needless to, say, we never received any, no apology & not even mentioned. We paid the check, and will never return.  Food was Meh and service was sub par. BTW, the place needs a makeover"}
{"text":"All I can say is this place has gone down hill. This used to be a gem in Scottsdale and now I think McDobalds is more impressive! Seriously, service was slow and our server didn't seem to know what he was doing. The highly recommended bass was like wood, prime rib was tough and so on!  We had a gift card that they upsold us on the last time we were here and they failed to tell us that you practically need a urine sample in order to be able to use it.   Anyways sad to see this had gone down hill as it truly was a great place not that long ago. Save yourself some trouble and don't waste your time. So many better restaurants in the Valley!"}
{"text":"This was the most awkward service I've ever had at a restaurant. The waiter was training a new girl. Fine. Why on a Saturday night though? He was awkward. She was awkward. Dinner was awkward. Aside from the weird vibe the food was truly not good. The seasonal salad contained figs that were not ripe and hardly a blue cheese chunk to be found. The salad was heavy on the prosciutto but so heavy it felt greasy. Sadly the salad was still the best part of the dinner. The oysters were pricey ($17 for 6) and definitely not my favorite. I did not finish them (thankfully but I will get to that later). I had my suspicions so I opted for something that seemed difficult to mess up for my entree. Wrong. I had the Mac nut crusted mahi. It was so over cooked it chewed like chicken. The vegetables were tough and the asparagus looked old. Let's just say after spending over $200 on dinner we weren't happy. Icing on the cake was two hours later I began vomiting from food poisoning. Still in bed as I write this review.!"}
{"text":"We had planned to see the Fremont Experience light show and reserved this restaurant after reading all the great reviews. Chart House did not dissapoint - good service, great food! Even my boyfriend, who's usually ambivalent regarding food, really enjoyed the place and still raves about it. He had the prime rib and I ordered the crab stuffed shrimp. Both were delicious, and portion sizes just right. TIP: Definitely try the crab cakes -YUMMM!"}
{"text":"Located over a lake in the scottsdale area serves fresh fish daily and high end cuts of meat."}
{"text":"When in Vegas, make sure you come to dine at chart house restaurant in Fremont.  This amazing fish tank restaurant is located in the golden nugget.  The ambiance is romantic, fun and exciting.  Compliments to the chef and kitchen staff.  Every dish was carefully craft and taste exceed my expectations, the pictures cant compare to real life experience.   Michael was my server, he was very knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive without being over bearing, its a fine balance.  Super processional team work.  I leave you all with some of my favorite pictures.   Trust me i had chef training in hawaii."}
{"text":"We popped in for Happy Hour...the drinks and wine were reasonable but let me tell you about the $5_8 appetizers...some unique ways to prepare some favs...The Kim chee calamari is off the hook good with a spicy sauce, nice pieces of squid over a bed of rice noodles  and the Ahi nachos were equally satisfying...the server needs a few lessons in how to warm up to people..God. I thought if it were to rain she had her nose so high in the air it would drown her...I really wanted to enjoy this more however the sever prevented that from happening.  She would be more suited to asking if I wanted fries with my burger. Therefore.....3 stars"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Great service, awesome food and memorable drinks.  What more could you ask for?  Ate here with the wife and some of our close friends. Everyone had a good time.  For the quality of food and the service, it is reasonably priced. I had the Tuna and it was absolutely sushi grade.  BTW. if you are hanging out downtown on a weekday,  Chart House has a great happy hour from 2-6 pm on weekdays in their bar. $5 appetizers and $5 drinks. We took advantage of it multiple times while we were in Vegas. Chocolate Martini and Humus Trio are excellent."}
{"text":"Such a great experience!! Our food was awesome! Had seafood and prime rib. We were celebrating our anniversary and our menu said happy anniversary with a card. Our waitress Kelly was so attentive. We enjoyed the whole experience. Will come back again!!"}
{"text":"Extremely poor management. This place used to be one of our favorites. We brought our family and friends here often, and always brought out-of-town visitors. The location is great. It's beautiful on the lake. The atmosphere is good as well. We have had good experiences with the wait staff, and our food has been good. However, we recently had friends we hadn't seen for many years visiting. We purposely made an early reservation so we could linger and enjoy their company. We didn't ask for a table with a lake view, but were delighted to get one.  We had drinks, salad, dinner, etc., totaling over $300. Our waiter came over, and apologetically said there were people wanting our table by the window!  We have asked many times on other visits for one of those prime tables, and have been told they were full or reserved, so we sat elsewhere. We got up to leave, and walked by at least eight empty tables. My husband stopped to talk to the manager, and made it clear we didn't appreciate being kicked out with our dear friends. I have NEVER been asked to leave an establishment - ever. This is unacceptable. The manager basically shrugged and said \"sorry.\" That was it. We chose this restaurant because we wanted a fine dining experience, and didn't want to be rushed through a meal. Diners have CHOICES. There are so many good restaurants in Scottsdale. Choose Maestros, Dominick's, Eddie V's, Ocean Prime, Ruth's Chris, or one of countless others if you want to be treated with respect."}
{"text":"Was very pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  I'm not typically a fan of downtown Vegas for dinner but was really glad we tried this spot.  The ahi appetizer was delicious.  The tuna was fresh and the accompanying sauces were a perfect match.  I had the sea bass and risotto as my entree.  Cooked perfectly.  The orange vinaigrette, cranberries and apples garnishing the sea bass provided the perfect combo of sweet and savory.  Something I was not expecting.  We also enjoyed a signature chocolate lava cake. It takes 30 minutes to prepare so order early. Decadent but the red wine recommended by our waiter helped to make it the perfect end to dinner."}
{"text":"The giant fish tank is likely the biggest allure. Had the sea bass and ahi dishes. Asian peas were also good. Service was solid. Wouldn't say it amazing. The chocolate signature dessert didnt seem worth the 30 min prep time. I'd come again but likely want to try other similar fair downtown."}
{"text":"Hmmm, go for happy hour and get the appetizers.  Watch the time, too, because if you dont get your drink order in....they won't honor it.    I was close at getting my last drink, but the rest of my party was denied.  Bartender said Verizon time and we all had Verizon phones, so we looked.  It was 12 min before the hour. I had asked for a drink TWICE already so I got mine, but the others were S.O.L.  We still had more and then closed out the tab and proceeded on to the dining area for $350.00.  Oysters were YUM, bread was good, main meal was just ok.  Atmosphere is amazing with the unicorn fish, especially.  Honestly, I would rather go back to Triple Sevens Brewery at Main Street Station though for more Pumpkin Ale and good sandwiches.  Anyhow....  It's vegas so you are paying high dollar for mediocre food.  It's just what it is.  Enjoy!!!  Didnt get to try a desert, but they looked fab!"}
{"text":"We went here on the 18th and it was amazing. Our server, Harris, was hands down probably the best server I've ever had the pleasure of being served by. So super friendly. I got the filet mignon and it was pretty expensive but really good. I recommend the Mac and Cheese but it's huge so share it! It's deep fried and as Harris put it \"kind of put together like a rubics cube\". It's a square! If you have room for dessert, spend the extra $1 and get the house-made strawberry ice cream with your lava cake. It's fantastic. My husband got the swordfish and I'm not a huge fan of seafood but I tried a bite and it was also pretty good! If you're worried...just know that there is not a dress code here. We went in shorts and tank tops. Ask for a seat by the fish tank! The fish are beautiful! For $300 you can pick one and they'll cook it for you! Just kidding....you can't do that. My husband told me you could and I believed him!"}
{"text":"Fresh seafood, delicious flavoring, magnificent salt water fish tank. Wonderful fine dine experience. Love it, love it, live it"}
{"text":"The experience we had was just fine.  Food, service and wine list were all good - salad bar was good too.  I am not sure if I'd go out of my way to go back though.  There are a lot of trendy and fun places to dine in the Scottsdale area and this one seems to be like the \"Grandfather of Scottsdale Dining\" - older and almost antiquated."}
{"text":"Love the bar here - prices are reasonable for a casino and the atmosphere is great.  Dinner was just OK.  The crab legs tasted like they were frozen, although they were sold at market price which implies they should be freeze.  Still, they were only OK.  The prime rib was excellent along with the mash potato's. Bread was nice a warm when delivered.  The service was fairly standard for a high priced place such as this.  It wasn't bad, but nothing out of the ordinary stuck out as exceptional service."}
{"text":"We went for Restaurant Week.   My boyfriend made a reservation for 5:30 and even though we arrived early, we were promptly seated right next to one of the windows. We were given not only the restaurant week menu, but the regular one and a Gluten-Free one to use as a cross-reference.   We opted to pay extra to take advantage of the salad bar and I am so glad we did. It was delicious. Fresh ingredients. All very cold - which is what I love.   I started with the spinach artichoke dip which was delicious. He had the hummus trio with fried plantains. He said the roasted pepper one was the best, closely followed by the edamame, and the original fell short with too much garlic.   He loved his prime rib and my black and blue salmon was phenomenal. I have never had such a well crafted piece of salmon. The bleu cheese butter and roasted onions brought out the flavor. The rice was meh, but who needs rice when you have salmon like that?   Dessert - he opted for the creme brulee and enjoyed it. I had the mini mud pie and thoroughly enjoyed it.   Service was fine. The manager stopped by our table to double check.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This used to be my all time favorite restaurant; I would want every birthday celebration and special occasion to be here, but sadly not anymore. The location of the Chart House is beautiful and elegant, it has the bones to be a 5 star luxurious dining experience. Unfortunately this place is far from what it once was. It used to have some of the best service, steaks, seafood, salad bar, and mud pie around...now the only thing it can boast is the view.   So let's start with the view since it is gorgeous and on the water, it makes for a romantic setting. Sadly the furniture and decor are dated, torn, and neglected which makes a fancy and expensive dining experience not quite as enjoyable or comfortable. The service used to be top notch, but it seems as though the staff knows the restaurant is going downhill and they are cranky and don't care about their jobs anymore.   The food used to be divine, but it is far from it now. The plates no longer look appetizing, and the salad bar is a a mere shadow of what it was in its former glory. The salad bar is what I used to look forward to the most, but you might has well just go to super salad.  I am so sad that the Chart House has let itself go. This was once a wonderful place that is now not worth the money or the time since there are so many other great places around to enjoy a good meal. If you just want some wine and dessert with a pretty view then by all means enjoy, but if you are looking for more go elsewhere."}
{"text":"From me, the Chart House gets 5 stars for location and ambience, both of which are very sadly lacking here in Scottsdale.  Unfortunately, what is also lacking in Scottsdale is quality, and the Chart House suffers a little from that as well.   That is not to say that the food isn't good.  It is.  But it isn't something you will rave about.  But get a waterfront table in the evening when the candles are burning, have a martini, and enjoy the salad bar if nothing else!  The nicest overall experience in the area.  Update:  I returned to the Chart House about a year after this review.   And while it still retains a wonderful atmosphere and good service, I do have to agree with many recent reviewers that the prices are now out-of-line with the quality of the food.   $30-$40 for a very basic seafood dish, and $16.00 for a nothing-special salad bar, are beyond the quality they are providing.  Further Update:  07/15/12:   Leave it to Landry's to destroy another fine dining establishment.   For 20 years I've looked forward to visiting The Chart House in many cities.   But it is now just another chain establishment, and with each visit, it slides downhill.   I must shed a tear and move on.  RIP Chart House."}
{"text":"For the prices they charge, you'd expect top-notch. The food they served I wouldn't even have paid $20/plate for. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because the service was good and the calamari appetizer was as well. We had to add salt to our king salmon, which was $37. My 3 yr old could've made it better. Presentation was bad too. Looked like hospital food. Never again!"}
{"text":"I have always liked the Chart House chain, even though I am not a seafood fan!  The Chart House in Las Vegas, at the Golden Nugget is one of my favorites!  The 75,000 gallon aquarium is the center piece of this restaurant and there is not a bad seat in the house for viewing it!  You can even ask the server for a fish identification chart if you are so inclined to learn what types of fish are swimming around in it.    It is absolutely amazing!  The food too is great.  The shrimp cocktail is firm and fresh, served with a great cocktail sauce.  The \"Calamari and Friends\" was delicious!  I highly recommend.  It was lightly fried and very fresh. The \"friends\" included lightly fried veggies -- carrots, peppers, and sweet potatoes.    The Chopped Spinach Salad with warm bacon dressing, chopped egg, bacon, radishes & mushrooms wash beautifully presented and then chopped by our server.  The dressing was just enough and not overwhelming like can often be with this type of salad.  Since I am not a seafood lover, I got the 12 oz. prime rib and it was melt in your mouth!  The baked potato that I ordered as a side was also perfectly done.  My partner had the Stuffed Flounder filled with jumbo lump crab drizzled with lemon butter and served with Yukon golden mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The stuffing was good but the fish lacked some flavor and was rather bland.    The prices are right in line with this type of high end restaurant with main dishes costing between $25 and $40.  Dress is business casual to casual (it is Vegas after all)."}
{"text":"I went here for my 31st birthday on Wed. I had made a reservation but we got to the place about 30 minutes early. They sat us. The restaraunt was very crowded and the tables are practically on top of each other. Our server was nice but a little too eager, always asking how we were doing. I guess some people like that but i felt rushed. They did print my name on the menu which was nice and I appreciated and they wrapped it up at the end and provided to me. I took a photo but don't really care to keep a copy of their menu. I had the yellowfin Tuna, lobster bisque and oysters. My husband just had the swordfish. My husband liked his food and everything tasted ok as we were eating. We finished pretty fast with a $175 check for 2 drinks, 1 app, a soup and 2 entrees. We were excited about walking around Freemont street after to hit up some of the bars. We walked around after and about an hour and a half after dinner I started sweating and ended up getting majorly sick. My husband did not get sick but he did not eat the same items. We ended up having to leave and I spent the rest of the night in bed so freaking sick. I emailed Chart House on their website to let them know that I had been sick and was 100% positive it was from the food as I had felt great before I ate and had nothing after I ate. No response from the site. Overall, I was highly disappointed that they would not even respond. Who knows if other people got sick as well as Im sure the restaraunt was not even notified by the website and I was too sick to call them. Overall, highly disappointed in this experience as there are so many other great places in Vegas to eat. I just happened to pick the place with the unfresh seafood. Eat with Caution!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Great atmosphere, the fish tank at the center of the restaurant is really cool...waitstaff and managers were extremely friendly...only waited 5 minutes for a table with no reservatfion on saturday night last week...drinks were delish! had their top shelf mojito YUM and my friend had their special bloody mary and loved it...menu was unique...we went with the soup trio -clam chowder (pretty good), lobster bisque (very good) and gazpacho (amazing)!!! I had the short ribs and scallops for dinner and was really good as well...the short ribs did have a burnt kind of taste but was still good...and the scallops were soooo good...i'd def go back again!"}
{"text":"I hate to give 5 stars to chain restaurants but I cant help it in this case.   Chart House is excellent across the board.    Sitting at the granite-bar top gives you a front row seat looking at their gorgeous aquarium while sipping down a well crafted cocktail.  My server was friendly, prompt, and helpful.      All elements of the meal were delicious...try the menage soup that gives you a small tasting of Clam Chowder, Lobster Bisque, and Gespacho.    My main entree was blackened swordfish served Oscar style with a delicious side of spicy fried rice.     And dessert was their famous Chocolate Lava cake.   Not a single imperfection with any of it.      And to top it off the price was sane.   You can easily pay double the price on the strip for an equal quality dinner.      Also, look for discounted gift cards at Costco (its part of the Landry's group)."}
{"text":"Not what I expected. My food was good but the rest of the people with me were not impressed. The service was okay, but we were not to happy when the two servers came out to serve our food and one chastised the other right in front of all of us for serving the plate on the wrong side. Not cool dude, to her what she did wrong once you get out of earshot from customers."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. I would never recommend this place to anyone. I made reservations with a new associate of mine and our reservation was backed up 25 minutes. The salad was mediocre and the service was even worse. We ordered 10oz prime rib, mine was medium rare and hers was well. They mixed up our plates and the prime rib was cold and after a few minutes we asked are waiter and he realized they were wrong. So he asked us to simply just switch our 7 oz of prime rib left because they were sold out and had no other option. So I switched my piece of meat with my associate of 3 days. At the end of the plate I had about 4oz of fat left which was triple the amount the other piece had. While I was looking to grab a manager to talk to my wine flight had been taken with over half a glass still being saved for our dessert. When I spoke with a manager about the many problems I had encountered over the horrible evening she simply said \"uh huh\" and walked away and we left with our bill $160 for the 2 of us and so much dissatisfaction."}
{"text":"Delicious food, we did get tricked into buying our water instead of just getting ice water.  Probably could have told them to take that off the ticket,because sink water is fine with me.  Hotel slots not very friendly!  lol"}
{"text":"2nd time at this location. The first time was about 2 years with a party of 8. It was a week day and the restaurant was completely empty. Maybe that is what threw me off but I remember having very negative memories of Chart House. Fast forward 2 years later and my husband and I decide to do Fremont Street for our Saturday night and we thought we would give CH another try. They seated us at a table for 2 that was directly against the beautiful aquarium. Everything from the moment we walked in was perfect!! Our server was truly a Pro and hit every note just right. I dont drink so I just ordered a Coke. My husband ordered a glass of wine and a beer. We started out with the Beet Salad. I am a sucker for a good Beet Salad and it was Spectacular!! I had the Chilean Sea Bass and my husband had the Prime Rib. I dont eat meat but his meal looked....well, Prime. My Sea Bass was perfectly cooked! Like Butter... The gorgonzola risotto was delish and the fish was garnished with a red wine reduction and cranberry relish. The red wine reduction complimented the fish so well that it was amazing! Everything was so perfect and our server was such an angel. We are definitely going to bring the entire family back here in summer..."}
{"text":"I was weary of a chart house near no large body of water but this was fun. Beautiful fish tank and amazing desert."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance here with the ability to dine lakeside on the patio.  Plus happy hour offers great selections including prime rib sliders & kim chee calamari.   The regular menu is wonderful but a bit pricey on spots.  Still,  a great place to dine."}
{"text":"So Landry's took over the Chart House at some point and I have noticed a significant improvement in their food and service. Had the lobster bisque and mac nut mahi; both were well prepared and flavorful. At this time of year their location on the lake is stunning, with beautiful holiday lights. The service is average but not bad. I plan to go back and see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Welcome to the Chart House Ocean . . . wait I mean fish tank.  OMG that thing is huge . . . Can I drop a line in that thing???  The last of the reviews for this week in Vegas . . . the Chart House . . . Seafood or Meat . . . No choice to be made here  . . . This is a MEAT week.  Ribeye for me, but more on that later.  I sat at the bar waiting for my business associate to arrive.  Contemplated having my choices in cocktails, which for me centers on bourbon or cachaça . . . Leblon or Bookers.  No choice . . . cachaça distilled by a Frenchman aged in American oak by a company that had no sales presence in Brasil prior to the Cabana cachaça beating . . . ask if you want the detail . . . or Bookers uncut Kentucky Straight Bourbon.  I am an American in the larger sense . . . I try to drink spirits from here . . . tonight is bourbon time.    Side note . . . Some one please import good aged cachaça to the USA.  Sagatiba has their velha but it is not in the same league as Armazem Veiera Onyx for example.    Two sips and off to the table.  I order my typical steakhouse meal - beefsteak tomato salad, ribeye steak (love the fat of the cut) and sauteed mushrooms.  The slices of the beefsteaks were too thin, but the chef gives the salad a twist . . . instead of raw onion he supplements it with an onion ring on each, sadly thin, beefsteak slice.  HE SHOTS, HE SCORES.  Nice twist.  The steak is really good, but not up to the same level as the other ribeye of the week.  Shared bottle of merlot with my associate . . . I prefer wines with more balls . . . a Malbec or a Zinfindel perhaps.  But I did not order the wine . . . so who am I to complain . . . wait I just did . . . What a jerk.  Finish the meal with a cup of coffee, yeah those of you that know me are not surprised.    On the walk back to my room, there is that fish tank by the pool . . . Those redfish look like groupers . . . forget the restaurant tank I want to fish this tank from above from the bar.   In the end, would I return?  HELL YES . . . Chart House is a chain but there is innovation and dependable meat and seafood . . . high quality and excellent relaxed service . . . if only they had some cachaça velha."}
{"text":"Excellent service and it was a delicious dinner. Loved our Double date night with friends."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for years. Last night I took my fiancé and her family here for her birthday, which I've done 3 years in row now. We have also been here a couple of other times. Each time it's been good. But last night was horrible.  1. I order an old fashion, the first one directly from the bar was perfect. The one I ordered from our waitress, was just bourbon on the rocks. When asked to adjust, it came back as watered down bourbon.  2. Upon ordering, we were told after the fact they were out of clam chowder. I heard walking to the salad bar that waitresses and waiters were running around cancelling orders. For a $40 a plate dinning experience the chef should have been more on top of this.  3. When I made it to the salad bar, they were out of many items, no one manning it and lettuce was brown. 4. Finally after getting our food, the food runner brought out one plate at a time. Now there were 8 of us so we had to wait 2 minutes between each plate.  5. After being served my Scallops and Shrimp, which at one time were much bigger, were cold/Luke warm. Which made them horrible. 6. Desert was \"okay\".  I've always enjoyed this place and happy to eat there but this time almost makes me not want to go back. I may give them one more chance. This was on a Sunday and the restaurant was not very busy.  I hope they get this fixed."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great scenery.... What more do you want?! Alexis our waitress was quick and helpful giving us the highlights of the popular dishes as well as her favorites. The fish tacos and the chicken BLT were perfect and all in front of the fantastic view of the massive fish tank. Good stop if you're on Fremont street or staying at the GN. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I give this place a one star, or perhaps maybe I should say two only because they do have a beautiful fish aquarium. Came here for my husband's birthday, we were so disappointed with the service an food. The lettuce on my salad was brown and small for $10, we ordered asparagus it was soggy and stringy we also ordered the prime rib which came cooked to death after we had order it to be cooked rare. The manager came over and tried to make things right by giving us a different prime rib. The problem with the prime rib is it has zero flavor and it was sizzler quality. . I told the waitress on a couple times that it was my husband's birthday, she made no effort to even say happy birthday. The martinis were weak and tiny.  I do not recommend this place unless you enjoy sizzler  quality  meat, old salad and tiny martinis that are watered down"}
{"text":"Another PERFECT dinner, along with perfect service.  I had the blackened sea bass Cabell. WOW! perfectly cooked and wonderful preparation. My wife had grilled salmon Oscar. Simply perfect. My favorite restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"Make a reservation! We were sat at a lovely table in the bar/lounge area. Service was slow to start but picked up and leveled off.  We were in a rush to see a show but it all worked out.  Great steaks, amazing mac and cheese, asian green beans, chopped salad all fantastic! Well worth it."}
{"text":"Great food!  Calamari app was amazing!! Ordered mahi Mahi which was good.  But still thinking about the calamari app."}
{"text":"So disappointed! I haven't been to this location in a few years but remember the great experience the last time so i planned a Christmas dinner with friends.  I ordered a Margarita for $13 that tasted like water with crushed ice in it. The snapper was dried out and  when the manager came around we told him and all he said was \"I'm sorry about that\". He never offered to replace the dish or make it right.  Needless to say, none of us  will be going back."}
{"text":"Good service and awesome fish tank. Food was ok. Big portions but some seemed premade or frozen"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, profesional service, I was very impressed. Dinning by the pond was nice, and this upscale restauraunt more than impressed me. It isnt the best in the valley, but it is consistently good food and service. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The view was absolutely amazing, I went here for my best friends birthday. The drinks were well prepared and not too expensive, we had a nice view over the lake and due to it being Veterans Day we got to see white and gold fireworks which were neat. The presentation of the food was spot on and not a single drop off. The service was not bad, our servers name was Eva and she was sweet and kudos for her serving 7 people. You get what you pay for in every situation. But you will not be disappointed when coming here, it's very upscale and romantic"}
{"text":"I need to set this up a little bit.  My wife and I have lived in Scottsdale for a year.  We've gone out to eat quite a bit.  I have to say I have not been impressed at all.  Don't get me wrong, we have our haunts that we like to go to quite a bit.  When it comes to new places I am a little scared.  We went to Chart House on Mothers Day, busiest day in the restaurant land.  My mother wanted to go.  My 70 year old father likes the \"salad bar\" at the Chart House.  I figured we were going to a \"senior\" joint and fortunately we were not going to spend a lot of money.  I was wrong on both ends.  The location is wonderful.  It's on a man made lake/pond thing which gives the customer a wonderful view.  For a moment I felt I was out of the dessert.  The decor was nice.  on to food.  THEY WERE OUT OF EVERYTHING.  I wanted prime rib, no prime rib.  I wanted ono, they were out of ono.  I got the Asian Seared Tuna with a wasabi cream sauce.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It was a wonderful cut of tuna, no fat on it.  The sauce was INCREDIBLE.  It had a kick, if you like don't spicy, this is not for you.  I can't remember what my wife and mom ordered.  I know my dad had a steak and it looked and tasted good but I would never order it here.  You can get a better steak somewhere else.  This is more of a seafood joint.  The salad bar was unique and very up class.  They make ceaser salads fresh for you.  Anchovies are available.  You can build your own salad which has many unique toppings to choose from.  The icing on the cake was the caviar.  Lots and lots of caviar.  My dad and I had maybe 3 plates of caviar.    Overall the value is good for a $$$$ dinner.  It was nice to take my parents there on a special day.  If I were to go back, I would just get the salad bar.  It's not cheap on it's own, but cheaper than the entrees.  The selection is top notch."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I ordered the filet mignon which was so tender it practically melted in my mouth. My sister's crab legs were cooked to perfection. The service was top notch, our server beyond attentive. If you are in Vegas do not miss the Chart House. Yes it's a bit pricey, but everyone deserves to splurge once in awhile!"}
{"text":"Great service. Good selection of Martinis and specialty drinks. Steaks were cooked perfectly and were tender and juicy. Loved their Bleu cheese topped filet. Side dishes can serve 2-4 people. Creamed spinach was excellent: sautéed mushrooms bland. Waiter was friendly."}
{"text":"Dinner for four at 6:30 on a weekday. Service was horrible. Salad bar good. New England clam chowder was lukewarm at best. Not overcrowded so no explanation for occasional visits by our server. Good thing we like our dining companions."}
{"text":"04/29/18 Late afternoon, some customers, not too busy so ... Expectation: Excitement, aquarium looks great, menu is interesting, let's try it .... Reality: Snobbish employees, sloooow service and poor customer relations!  Party of five, drinks were ordered and came in a reasonable time.  Ordered appetizers and waited and waited and waited, four clam chowders and one lobster bisque took over 30 minutes to serve.  During this time, no one checked on us or let us know what the delay could possibly be.  More waiting for charcuterie & cheese plate and spring rolls, finally the server comes back and says your plates will be out in just a few minutes. We tell her never mind and speak to the manager, she comps the four clam chowders but the damage is done. Not once during this marathon did the server or anyone check to see if we wanted more drinks or to let us know they realized we were still there. I expected and have received much more from other Landry's restaurants. Went over to California Noodle House, welcomed with open arms, excellent service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Sit in Randy's section! Came in for lunch today (and my fiancé is a GN employee) with my parents who were visiting. Cannot say enough about this place. Randy was friendly and engaging, menu knowledge on point. Food was amazing per usual. Kimchee calamari, shrimp cocktail, lobster grilled cheese, seafood trio, fish and chips, and fish tacos.   Oh and that dang soufflé OMG. We will be back.   Thank you Randy!"}
{"text":"Recently a buddy of mine and I flew into town on a home rebuilding project. I don't often travel but when I do, I try to find a good steak during my stay. I've had some good success in eating a premier plate.  Nice seating as a walk-in. Got a nice seat overlooking the lake. Clean and high end.  Saw a celebrity. Me.   This place would have made for a nice romantic experience however I was traveling with a buddy and I was not looking for a Bromance...  A little pricey, nice experience and good food. Watch for the roaming ducks and geese.  =RAY="}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere. Waite Staff was top notch, And don't miss the fish tank. Wife had Prime Rib that melted in her mouth.I had the grilled flounder topped with Cabell. I don't think I ever had a taster flounder. I would recommend the Chart House for any one whose is downtown or going to the Fremont Street Experience."}
{"text":"We were a little nervous about having dinner down Fremont St, however Chart House did not disappoint. The service was great and his recommendations were all on point. We had the crab cake as an appetizer which was not your typical crab cake full of breading. This was my favorite thing on the menu. Everything in it was so fresh and it had great flavor. My husband and I ended up splitting a shrimp plate that had 9 shrimp cooked 3 different ways. This was also very impressive! We left very full and happy. The extra plus is that the view of the fish tank is pretty cool anywhere you sit. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for good seafood in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Special Event, Terrible Service, unresponsive Manager  Reserved a table on the patio for a very special evening, including guests from out of the country. Was told we would have patio seating. Called to confirm our reservation one hour before, and was told they had booked a special party so we would not get a patio table. Will we get a window? No, your party is too large but we will put you at the next row from the window. Arrived on time for our 5:30 reservation, mentioned our disappointment to the front, and we were seated FIVE rows from the window. Made no fuss, but did call the manager today, reported the above and was told we never should have been promised any table...seating is first come first served.  Just realized there was an empty table our size in the second row, which was not filled until well after our arrival! Service was also lacking: for example--no serving utensils for shared appetizers, and other minor errors not expected at a restaurant of this expense. Reported all this to the manager, and was \"invited to come again\". When I asked what that meant, he said \"you will be served as you should be served\". I told him I expected to be served as I should be served without an invitation!  Thanked him for his time and told him we are unlikely to be back, even though we are moving close to the restaurant next month. This was our fifth visit to the Chart House, each time hoping for a bit better.  Likely it will be our last. BTW, beware of the constant attempts to upsell.  \"Would you like sauce with that?\"  \"Order your hot desert before you order dinner because it takes a long time to cook\" and on and on!"}
{"text":"Just a bit disappointed with orders coming out wrong, steaks were cold and very under cooked, and it wasn't terribly busy so it was odd and not up to par with other Chart House locations. Not terrible but underwhelming .."}
{"text":"We went for lunch. The reason I am giving this three stars and not four is because the lunch selection was very limited and underwhelming. Therefore, this place is likely better for dinner. There are very limited selections for entrées and they were all pretty boring, with the best one being the fish of the day. Therefore, my friend and I decided to order two appetizers: the lobster and shrimp spring rolls and we also ordered the hummus platter, which comes with three types of hummus: avocado, mildly spicy red pepper, and olive, along with plantain chips and some pita. Just ok... I then ordered the farmers market salad which was good. My friend ordered the new England clam chowder which was also good. We had water. Overall, the food was OK but nothing to write home about or want to try again. The service is very friendly and the prices are reasonable. The restaurant is cute with a large aquarium and a pretty clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Dear Chart House: I keep getting emails from you stating I have a reservation, yet I have never made a reservation at your restaurant.  This is not exactly the way to advertise to get my attention to come eat at your establishment.  Please stop the emails."}
{"text":"I think Chart House has one of the best happy hour deals in the golden nugget. The food and drink prices are unbeatable during this time. We tried four different appetizers with the spicy shrimp being our favorite (so much so that we ordered another one!) The tuna nachos and fish tacos were also delicious. It was really fun to sit in front of the giant fish tank and enjoy our happy hour. I recommend trying this at least once if staying in the area!"}
{"text":"Something smells fishy. Upon entering the restaurant a strong smell of fish was present.  This usually is a bad sign that the fish isn't fresh. We ordered salads and I had Steak.  The food was fair and service was fair at best. Definitely will not return"}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday in December. Amazing! They made that day special, not only with great service but with reserving my party even when they were busy and fitting us in. The view is wonderful, would come back during the day for it. Prices are worth it! Thank you chart house restaurant keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Not impressed to say the least. We had soggy cesar salad, a sweaty bitter artichoke and tasteless NY strip. For dessert we had the \"mud pie\" which was basically a 11$ chunk of coffee ice cream.  I tend to be a \"food snob\" but if I'm going to drop 100$ on a meal, at least it should be better than Outback Steakhouse. Save your money. It's a beautiful location (hence the 2 stars), the staff seemed passive aggressive with one another. Overall it was awkward to fake enjoy a sub-par meal."}
{"text":"Excellent Service with great food and drinks this is a great place in downtown Vegas. Can't say they have the best short ribs in Vegas which paired with the scallops was very good. I can say that the service was outstanding combined with a great menu this is a must stop."}
{"text":"I came here by myself ( in town on business) and had a later supper. I was greeted and seated promptly and had very friendly and attentive service all night.  I had the crab cake as an appetizer which was excellent!! I've always thought The Oceanaire had the best crab cake but this one was awesome! Very lumpy with crab and no filler.  I had the coconut shrimp as an entree and was very happy with them and he variety of dipping sauces. Really liked the sweet coconut and the chili sauces.  I was there to use my Landry Select club birthday reward but was surprised with a turtle ice cream dessert which was very good also.  Will return when visiting Scottsdale again"}
{"text":"I found The Chart House to be average. Ordered a bowl of Clam chowder which was tasty with lots of clams. The main course of Shrimp Scampi was not very good because the shrimp tasted like microwave Shrimp, they were large, but a bit dry and chewy. I would try eating there again,but not the Shrimp Scampi. My wife had short ribs and salmon. She was quite pleased with her meal. The salmon was succulent and the ribs were tasty.  So a split decision."}
{"text":"Lunch was $89 for 2 people.  Service great. Only reason I only give 3 stars....I've never paid $89 for a lunch for 2 people   We each got a cup of soup each, 1 beverage/person, a seafood salad and shrimp scampi. Clam chowder is award winning and it was tasty but it had A LOT of potatoes and celery. Clams too, but I prefer higher clam to potato & celery ratio.  The fish tank is AWESOME! We got to sit right next to it."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with friends. The service was AMAZING! Our server Randy was on point with all our needs. Our friends we're celebrating their anniversary. I mentioned it to Randy and they presented our friends with a card signed by their team who served us. The chef even came out and talked with us. And gave our friends a special dessert for their anniversary. The food was so good. Steaks cooked to perfection! The chopped salad is huge and every bite had a little bit of everything in it. The Chart House was the perfect choice for dinner. We will definitely be coming back again & again."}
{"text":"Immediately upon walking in, you'll be mesmerized by the beautiful decor and massive wrap-around aquarium. Every time I dine here, I get seated right next to the aquarium so that we can enjoy the beautiful scenery.   I've been here for lunch a couple times and also late night munchies, service is always quick and on point. The food and drinks are consistently good as well. We always leave here full and satisfied. And sometimes sorta kinda drunk. Thanks Vegas.   SHORTS RIBS ($19): http://bit.ly/2i0RwX7 This is by far the best braised short ribs I've had to date.  This massive piece of boneless short rib was so juicy and fork tender. The rich velverty cabernet demi-glace was also quite delicious. The garlicky yukon gold mashed potatoes was velvety and smooth that I finished the whole thing (and I'm not a mashed potato fan at all, so that says a lot). Tis dish is a must-order.   SEAFOOD SALAD TRIO ($20): This was my half-ass lazy attempt at trying to be healthy while pigging out in Vegas....it had the word \"salad\" in it, so it counts. Yep...that's a fried tortilla on the side, lol!  http://bit.ly/2hEyOUc - The \"shrimp napoleon\" was basically 2 cocktail-styled jumbo shrimps butterflied and laid criss-cross over each other. Perfectly cooked shrimp, nothing fancy.  - 2 slices of pepper seared tuna - A spoonful of jumbo lump crab meat The rest of the plate consisted of a couple pieces each of tomatoes, hearts of palm, prosciutto crisps and a scoop of avocado-kimchee slaw with ranch dressing.   The bf and I split this deconstructed salad as an appetizer.  It didn't look or sound like a lot of seafood, but it was definitely filling and something I wouldn't mind ordering again.   FISH TACOS (2 tacos for $12.50): Fish of the day was mahi mahi.  The bf fully enjoyed his plate of tacos. The cajun-spiced mahi was juicy and tender. The jack cheese, fresh cabbage, pico de gallo and ranch dressing was the perfect accompaniment to this filling plate of food.   Our server that day was a hella fun guy name Randy. He was so bubbly and friendly, love him! He was so engaging and even offered suggestions of which museums to check out because it was my bf's first time in Vegas.Hopefully we get to see him again the time we visit because we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"stopped in with a group of guys we crushed a few rounds of drinks at the bar and the bartender talked us into some apps they were amazing. the prime rib sliders are a home run and cheap for happy hour"}
{"text":"I spent my birthday at Chart House last night and had a wonderful experience. The food was great I got the stuffed shrimp and to drink the moscato sangria...yum! Anyways the food was great but to top my experience my server was even greater. Josh was our server and he went above and beyond his duties. My two year old daughter was with us and when she wanted cherries from my drink and couldn't have them he went and got her a plate of cherries then when she was eating all my croutons he went and grabbed her a bowl of croutons. It's the little things like that, that made my experience so great! Plus he was just all round a great service provider and fun to talk too. So thank you Josh I hope you get some to read this or someone acknowledges you because you were awesome!"}
{"text":"Went on New Year's Eve and couldn't be more pleased. Coconut shrimp was delicious as was the crab cakes. Salad bar was fresh and well stocked, and service staff were helpful and friendly. Pleasant experience on a busy night."}
{"text":"Hosted my mother's 50th birthday party at Chart House and they were very accommodating. Every aspect of customer service made the event run so smoothly... Manager to set up reservation, hostesses to assist with seating and decos, waitresses- 2 handled a party of 25 perfectly. My husband and I returned a couple nights later for a more intimate dinner and thoroughly enjoyed our food. The beautiful aquarium made for some wonderful birthday pictures."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. They have a great happy hour until 6pm during the week where they have $5 martinis and small plate appetizers for $5-$7. The ambience is amazing I LOVE the big fish tank in the center of the restaurant. So relaxing to sit and watch the fish before dinner with a drink.   Their food is delicious I get the scallops every time. My mom got the coconut shrimp she said they were delicious and the presentation wow'd us all. Grandpa got the steak, cooked to perfection with a side of their green beans (these green beans are a must order!) and grandma got the salmon which was delicious and a large portion.   All the staff is friendly the manager goes out of his way to thank you for coming and is a very nice guy. I would recommend making a reservation if your going for dinner as it gets busy!   This is a solid place to go for date night!"}
{"text":"Hubby & I went for dinner, we got the shrimp cocktail for appetizer and i got a sangria moscato was very delicious, hubby ordered the salmon which wasn't very good, I got the sea bass was better than his. Oh also got a lobster bisque soup that was probably the best part of whole meal. They took a long time with our entrees."}
{"text":"Was expecting a lot more for the price. Their focus is on seafood and I was expecting at least average is not better but it really missed the mark for me. Portions small and seafood not its freshest. Ambiance was nice but a little dated in the lighting and furniture."}
{"text":"The food I ordered was delicious. I highly recommend the salmon and the coconut shrimp appetizer. The ambiance is lovely (there is a beautiful view of the lake and geese). Perfect date night spot."}
{"text":"WHAT A FANTASTIC THANKSGIVING DINNER I HAD HERE AT CHART HOUSE TONIGHT! Yes, folks, my family and I don't cook for Turkey day. We don't like the mess or the cooking part. Lol. Anyways, my dad made reservations here a few weeks ago online. We were seated within a few minutes upon arrival and greeted quickly by our server. The ambiance was great. Super intimate with low lighting (probably not best for those with poor vision LOL) and beautiful views! The buildings across the lake were decorated with beautiful Christmas lights and if it were day time, I'm sure the lake view would have been amazing.  So, we started off with a bottle of white wine that my dad picked. Forgot which kind. We ordered the kimchee calamari, and oh my lanta, what a great choice that was! It was a little salty, however, so if you're watching your salt intake, beware. For thanksgiving, they offered a turkey dinner, so of course I ordered this as did the rest of my family. It came with turkey, choice of mashed potatoes or sweet potato, creamed spinach, cranberry jelly, and cornbread stuffing with your choice of pumpkin or pecan pie for dessert. Yes, it was exquisite. Perhaps my favorite part was the creamed spinach. When we ran out of wine, I ordered the fiery cucumber cocktail (cucumber martini basically with cayenne pepper rim... Caliente!). My boyfriend ordered the berry Moscow mule... The berries complimented the ginger beer SO well!  I guess I was overall very pleased with the atmosphere, food and the service. It is strange that this place got mediocre reviews overall... Perhaps it is necessary to look at demographics to see whether or not reviews will actually be accurate. ;)  Although we came here for Thanksgiving, I would definitely come back again another night. I would want to sit on the patio for sure during the day and enjoy Arizona's wonderful winter season. I recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Nice cozy resturant, we didn't have to wait to get seated. Our server was nice, food was good. I would definitely eat here again. Next time I would like to come here for dinner and try something different. I ordered the fish tacos, they were good but I didn't like that they came with fries, I was expecting rice and beans however the fries were good. My hubby ordered the short ribs with mashed potatoes, he enjoyed his meal. I also had the chopped spinach salad which was good as well."}
{"text":"A group of 8 of us ate her for my MIL's 60th Birthday, reservations were made for tables in front of the tank and it was beautiful.  4 of us arrived earlier than the other 1/2 and we were seated and napkins placed at our laps, chairs pulled out and just greeted with such professionalism and pride in their job.  We ordered and shared the fried calamari and stone crab claws.  Everyone that ate the crab were very pleased, and the fried calamari was cooked perfectly not chewy and the sauce that came with it was delish.  There were a variety of entrees ordered, and served as ordered and everyone was pleased.   Our service was impeccable from start to finish, they were there just enough not overly attentive but our drinks were kept full as well as our belly:) What a great place to celebrate or just enjoy a wonderful dinner."}
{"text":"Location was rather weird to me - dark inside overlooking beautiful bright lake - and being empty when we arrived, spirit was off upon entry. We had a quick stop as result and ordered 3 happy hour items and drinks for 4 people. Food was average, our server however was REALLY nice. Can't say I'd rush back there -"}
{"text":"A++ restaurant Awesome view. Service A++ our server Melissa D was awesome. Everything we ordered was very flavorful. We are very great full for the wait staff and others for serving us on Christmas Day."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is fantastic! I had the crab cake which although was a small portion had an incredible flavor. For my main entree i had the savory gold sea bass and all i can say is wow! Easily the best piece of fish I've ever had! It was so beautifully cooked! The impeccable sea bass came topped on a bed of delicious risotto. These Chefs know exactly what it takes to run a fine dining restaurant! Bravo!"}
{"text":"Fantastic steam and great service. There was surprisingly no wait for our table and we were severed promptly. The wine was superb. Our filet was grilled to a perfect pink medium and topped the night off. I would recommend."}
{"text":"I have been to many different locations of this wonderful restaurant. I have enjoyed this location four times. I absolutely love it here. That being said, we did have a few problems with our waitress. Her name was Kim. She was bitter, catty & completely unprofessional. However, the excellent manager, by the name of Mark, apologized on her behalf & made everything perfect for us.  We started off with some drinks. My pomegranate martini was delicious. We also ordered the port of Manhattan, it looked very pretty because of all the cherries. It was very strong because of the bourbon. We also ordered the shrimp cocktail. It is always fresh & it comes with that dry ice affect which looks very interesting. I have ordered other appetizers. The coconut shrimp is also very delicious & crispy. And, I really love their beet salad & lobster bisque.   I wasn't very hungry this time. But, I have never been disappointed with anything that I have ordered as an entrée, either for lunch or dinner.   We did have an appetite for their chocolate lava cake. Which looks beautiful, but it tastes even better than it looks! Also, the view of the giant beautiful aquarium is always a treat! Even though, we had a rocky start this time... Thanks to Mark & all the other wonderful people that work there, we ended up having an amazing time!"}
{"text":"Four of us went to Chart House for a birthday celebration. Have been there for four years before.  Salad bar is a disaster.  Limp old lettuce personally tossed.   Limited toppings like you get in diners..  At the end of the salad bar, you can heap your plate with stewed veggies of unknown origin (ugh), potato  salad, canned fruit salad, and some kind of rice concoction.  Really gone down hill in the last four years.  Not worth $18.00; One of our group ordered a chicken entrée for $22.  It was a small leg and a thigh. Wonder who gets the better parts of the chicken.  Veggies with entrée are all extra. Dessert is a store made coffee ice cream wedge Fake butter with the bread.  Great service.  If you want to be ripped off as you look over the small lake , this is for you.  But trust me folks, there are a lot better eateries in the area."}
{"text":"I am in love with this location, I have visited the one in Monterey CA a few times but this location is the stuff. I loved the portion sized and the fish aquarium in the middle of the bar area is to die for. My food was prepared exactly as I requested and they were really quick to deliver our appetizers, hot and delicious. Can't wait to go back on my next visit to Las Vegas"}
{"text":"We specifically came here so we could sit by the large aquarium.  We weren't too hungry, so we shared the kimchee calamari appetizer for $11.00.  Portion was big, and we even had leftovers.  The calamari included both rings and tentacles and some veggies, all fried up to a golden color.  Underneath the calamari was loads of white, puffy rice noodles.  That was a pleasant surprise!  Service was great and we even got to share a small slice of their mud pie for our anniversary.  We also got a congratulations card, signed by the staff.  Next time we are in Vegas, we hope to try some entrees and their clam chowder!"}
{"text":"Very noisy location so don't expect a quiet romantic dinner.  The food is first rate and the service is good.  Nice bar menu with great wine and cocktail selection.  The fish is the way to go.  The toppings can be busy so choose carefully.  I like the shark, flounder, scallops  and sea bass.  Good beet salad.  Felt congested on Valentine's Day with waiter rushing to take our order.  Come during slow periods."}
{"text":"They have a nice happy hour, the prices were great. The calamari was addictive, definitely try it for yourself. I was disappointed that the only gluten free option was hummus with carrots, but the hummus trio was still tastey."}
{"text":"Here for a work conference event. Had happy hour with  colleague tonight. The waitress (tall blonde with long hair) had a crappy attitude. She was not welcoming or friendly. i'm shocked at her snotty attitude. Very disappointing.  Thanks for nothing Chart House - I will be sure to mention my bad experience to the conference oganizers.   I will not be back."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant out for Restaurant Week.  It has been on my shortlist to try based on the offered selections.  The restaurant itself is quite beautiful and is on a lake in Scottsdale and made for a beautiful place to watch the sun set.  The dining room was pretty clean, but I did spy quite a few cobwebs in the ceiling lights.  We had to request a Restaurant Week menu as it was not provided when we were seated. (This is a first as the many other places we have visited over the years have always advertised their participation.  It almost made me feel ashamed to ask for it.)  The alcoholic drink selection was ok.  They serve hardly any beer, if you want beer with your dinner go somewhere else.  The mixed drinks were ok with the Moscato Sangria being the top beverage of the night.  We ordered our food.  We were provided a bread basket but there literally wasn't 1 piece of bread per person at the table, and one person was stuck eating crackers.  No additional bread was ever offered (probably because we ordered the Restaurant Week), the apps came out timely.  The beef carpaccio was overall the best app.  The others were mediocre.  When the main course came out we tried everyones' meals.  The macadamia crusted shrimp were good, but very tough.  The prime rib was way overdone for the medium that was ordered, and the herb crusted chicken was literally raw.  The chicken was immediately sent back to the kitchen.  10 minutes later the exact previously raw already cut into chicken breast was placed back on the exact same plate and served as it was.  The server claimed the item had been replated but it very clearly had not been.  No one was blown away by any of the meals.  The desserts came out, they were ok.  The Creme Brûlée was definitely the best.  At the end of the meal the Manager came by to check on our meal, we recounted the raw chicken fiasco and he told us \"thank you for your patience\" and \"I will let the cooks know\".  So I am pretty sure they already know since they had to recook the thing!!  Not one item was comped on the bill... not one...  Keeping in mind the price point of this restaurant, the service was poor and the food was way below par.  I have experienced much better meals at Red Lobster for much less money.  We will not be returning.  If I am spending in the $30-$60 a plate range there are far better options available that will keep me returning to that meal in my dreams."}
{"text":"This is my most repeated meal in Vegas and that's saying something because there are SO MANY GOOD places to eat! I've gotten the Prime Rib Sliders at least 6 different times. They're on the happy hour menu (I think $8) but we were after that so no discount (but we got fries so worth it). They are consistently delicious and the best $10 or less you can spend for food IMO. The bar is always fun to sit and watch the fish. The couch/chairs are a little awkward for eating with the coffee table being so low, but whatchagonnado if the bar is full right! :-)"}
{"text":"Sat in lounge both times...great view of the fish tank. Also the crab and avo stack was delicious. Service was poor. The cocktail server the last time was very unfriendly and seemed like she was having either a terrible day or was just plain miserable. Definitely ruined it."}
{"text":"This place in Vegas woos you off the strip.  At the Golden Nugget we saw the really cool HUGE fish tank.  This thing was sooooo cool, we were playing drinking games with it because we sat right by it ha.  Because the Golden Nugget is off the strip, you wouldn't expect this kind of service, this kind of food and this much fun.    We had the Surf & Turf plate and Lobster...the spread was the tits! The tender ribs were delicious the potatoes were on point and the lobster...well it hit it out of the park.  If you stay at the Golden Nugget, use your winnings on this place, it's fun enjoyable spot off the strip."}
{"text":"The only thing I was raving about after this meal was the dessert (The hot chocolate cake).  It was lick the plate yummy.  I'm sorry I didn't save more room for it.  The rest of the meal was good, but if I am going to pay that much, I want to be able to give the meal more than three stars.  I had the tuna and my boyfriend had the filet.  We both ordered coconut rice with our meals and what came looked more like rice pilaf and the waitress SWORE it was the coconut rice.  I'm not one to get into in debate over rice, but that was some funky coconut rice.    The landscaping and setting was beautiful.  The tiki torches on the lake were a nice touch and the lake had enough ducks to create their own colony."}
{"text":"The meal I had here is  one of the top ten meals I've had in my life. Everything I ordered and everything my friends ordered came out perfectly prepared.   When we made the reservations they asked if we were celebrating something special. We told them we were celebrating our friend's birthday. When the menu was given to us her name and special birthday greeting was printed at the top of the page.   I highly recommend the Bruschetta Sliders and the Hummus Trio as an appetizer. The Chilean Sea Bass was the best cooked fish I've ever had.   The service was great. Our waiter was very attentive, every time he cleared our plates he also cleared our table cloth of crumbs. When I asked him for a wine suggestion he recommended two and brought out two samples for me to try.   The atmosphere is like most nice restaurants, but there is a huge fish tank for you to enjoy."}
{"text":"In LV with the in-laws who requested a good seafood dinner. Naturally, we thought Chart House would be a good choice.  First, we arrived fairly early for dinner so it was nowhere near packed inside, but we were seated at the worst table in the house. A corner seat next to the kitchen with way too much in/out traffic to ensure a relaxing meal. We moved to a much nicer inside table closer to the fish tank.   Our server was a nice guy with a  sense of humor who seemed happy to be serving us but would've been happier if we'd ordered cocktails.  But then the food arrived...  Pop had Seared Scallops with green beans, delicious and perfect in every way.  Mom had a combo plate with Salmon and shrimp scampi served with a side of mashed potatoes and a crab cake (loaded with crab and hardly, if any, bread crumbs). The sides were cold to the touch and sent back.  Wife had the CH Special with calamari, tempura lobster and fish&chips. She didn't want fries so she ordered the green beans instead. The only items served hot were the lobster and the fish. Unfortunately, the fish were two tiny \"fish sticks\" like you'd get from a Gorton's box. If you choose this combo you'll see \"fries and more\" listed. The \"more\" is a delcious melange of fried jalapeno and bell peppers and carrots. We had the green beans and calamari served again but fresh out of the fryer the 2nd time.  I had the clam chowder, which was fan-freaking-tastic with tons of clams and very little potato. Would've liked it even more if it had been served piping hot. Also had the shrimp with garlic pasta, which should have been better than it was. I ate the shrimp and left the tasteless carb pile of pasta.  This dinner for four was $160.00 with no drinks or cocktails. At these prices we should NOT have had to return anything to the kitchen and nothing was comp'd."}
{"text":"I had just landed in Vegas and was starving - late lunch as it was. So I sat at the bar and the bartender was super friendly; got a nice cold beer and water to start and then ordered the tuna - rare. It was delicious! Great flavors all together and the side of jasmine rice was also very tasty with the 2 sauces that were on the plate. Good option - and I loved the aquarium right in front of me!"}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say here folks. I ordered the stuffed shrimp and they literally melted in my mouth. Deserts were yummy and service, despite being on of the busiest times of year with trade shows was fantastic."}
{"text":"Wow, what a beautiful display of tropical fish in the middle of a dining experience. Is it morbid to be eating seafood while watching it swim around in circles... whatever, I don't care lol  My sister, mom, and I decided to share a couple appetizers. We were going to sit and have dinner but realized we weren't  that hungry and didn't want to take up a table, so we just sat in the bar area.  We ordered calamari and lobster shrimp rolls. The calamari we all agreed was the best we have ever had but the rolls just didn't hit the mark, why I only have 4 stars. They needed some more flavor and meat in the wrap and we got mostly cabbage mix... oh well maybe they aren't always that bad, and we got an off order. The sweet citrus chili sauce that was served along the side was very good, and maybe we are suppose to look passed the roll and focus on the sauce? Not for $16. Will be back for calamari"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic happy hour, huge portions for happy hour plates. Bartenders were all very nice and welcoming, the huge tank behind the bar is full of mesmerizing fish that you can stare at all day. Hint, they have a fish book to let you know all the fish that's in the tank."}
{"text":"Amazing Restaurant Experience! My siblings and I celebrated our parents 50th anniversary this past Saturday. We chose to dine at the Chart House since we were staying at the Golden Nugget and I am so glad we did! We were a table of 14. Everything came off superbly! The waitstaff was impeccable. The entrees and wine suggestions were paired perfectly. I can truly say that it was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had and we visit Vegas a lot. Give this restaurant a try. You will rave as we did! Some of the appetizers/entrees that I have had elsewhere but the best at this restaurant were: Crab, Avocado, and Mango Stack, Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, Coconut Crunchy Shrimp, Prime Rib, Fish and Chips, Hot Lava Cake, Warm Bread. I am sure this is not all we loved!"}
{"text":"I really liked the ambiance of the Chart House.  From our comfortable, contemporary booth unusual looking fish swirled about before our eyes in a large and tall tube-type aquarium while we dined.  The place was sleek and modern, beginning with two 6-foot hostesses in black miniskirts, appearing much like human bookends, who confirmed our reservation and gave us a friendly greeting when we arrived.  The aqua floor upon entry looked like water, which added to the sea mystique.  Our first dish was dramatic, with a nice presentation of true meaty jumbo shrimp that were shooting off steam from dry ice.  A complimentary bread basket was small, but it was ample for 2 diners, and contained good brown and white bread, as well as tasty rolls.  New England Clam Chowder was good but unusually crunchy from celery, while Diane dealt with a Lobster Bisque that was rather heavy on the brandy.  Sauteed Mushrooms were juicy, and this side was very large and lasted all the way to dessert, but the sauce on the sizzling skillet was not that tasty.  However, a lovely chopped Spinach Salad with egg, mushrooms, and red onion was.  What I particularly liked about this dish is that the various parts were presented in side by side fields of color: a column of yellow egg placed next to a column of green lettuce, and so forth.  Then it was left up to the diner to toss all ingredients and the fine dressing together as desired, which I found to be fun rather than an annoyance.  I then enjoyed a good pan-fried pink Salmon enhanced by a blanket of crisp prosciutto, while Diane ultimately enjoyed  very tasty Stuffed Flounder.  I know, because I tried it too!  But, the Flounder that was originally brought to the table had to be sent back, because the first batch was too spicy for my spouse's delicate palate.  I appreciated that the request for a less spicy breaded Flounder was cheerfully accommodated, and although it took awhile for a new entree to be cooked, the manager personally brought out the replacement, and it was made just as requested.  We also shared a side of great Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes, and I had fine Green Beans presented on my plate.  Our dessert of a Chocolate Souffle that had properly risen was good but not what we expected to receive.  It was real airy--more like a tasty meringue than a sumptuous souffle.  Service was impeccable!  It was attentive, and there was not one service error by our very competent female server.  In fact, the worst thing that occurred happened days after the meal when all photos of the food but one were lost in a failed effort to store them in a backup drive.  Hence, the single photo that appears with this review.  But at least that photo was taken just after a slew of dishes had been placed on the table.  This was the first and only time my photos for a Yelp review were totally lost before they were loaded on the restaurant's site.  May it be the last!"}
{"text":"Ok everyone, this use to be my favorite place. Usually there is great service, food, and nice atmosphere. I normally go for the peaceful view and the sangria. My last visit during June 2017 was very disappointing. The Sangria was not sweet and the famous crab cakes were mussy. Slow service too. The view, however, was still peaceful.  I am not sure what happened here but they will need to redeem themselves with me (if there is a next time). For the price, I do expect much better."}
{"text":"Soooooo disappointed!!! Supposed to be a 5 * restaurant and the service sucked!!  We even went with a large group and they didn't appreciate the business, believe me!! The manager didn't even care how you felt.  He made up an excuse for not having a white tablecloth because it was a nice wood table. Bullshit! The table looked like a leftover from the Bingo hall!  We didn't even get to enjoy any bread, water or dessert!!  Poor poor service!! Not worth the time or place to eat!! Check out Vic n Anthony's - now that is 10 ***** well worth the time and money!  Some say Charthouse is discriminatory so beware...!!! Wouldn't send my worst enemy there!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. The hostess was rude and incompetent. After a wait(with a reservation) in a room that wasn't busy, I was shown to a table for 8 (for a party of 2).  My friend was never escorted to the table (per my request), and wandered until she located me. The Caesar was drenched in dressing and not tossed. My entree came exactly the opposite of what I ordered and took too long to be replated. The portion was much skimpier than past visits. The server checked back late upon original service and too late for drink refills. Despite my comments to the hostess and server, no manager was in sight all evening. Scottsdale has much better to offer than the Chart House!"}
{"text":"Lovingly atmosphere here 75000 gallon tank with over a thousand fish romantic atmosphere wonderful service tonight it's coconut shrimp clam chowder and a beet salad a little change up from my Italian Eats lately I've eaten it over 100 restaurants in Las Vegas and then to every Hotel I really do need to make some more reviews"}
{"text":"We went to the Chart House just last night for a work party/dinner. And I was blown away! After reading the reviews here on Yelp, my husband and I were a bit worried about coming. But we were so pleasantly surprised. When we arrived, for our work event, a mini version of the original menu had been selected for us to choose from. I was a bit panicky because I have Celiacs and have to be gluten free, and not many of the options on the pre-selected menu was gluten free. And none of the appetizers they had brought out for our cocktail hour were gluten free either. One of the servers, Ronni, made it his personal responsibility to find me things I could eat! So he brought out a special plate just for me during cocktail hour, and continuously brought me Shirley Temples before they would even run out. They would joke and call me their special guest and favorite attendee.  And Ronni told me I could order anything I wanted off of the gluten free menu! Which made me feel SO much better and gave me a much more varied selection. I even would have been happy with the salad they had pre-selected so long as there were no croutons. But they brought me a whole different salad with strawberries and mandarins! It was delicious! I ordered the lobster tail, and had a baked potatoe. And crem brule for the dessert. And everything was perfect and delicious!  The rest of the staff was absolutely wonderful as well, everyone was genuinely kind and hospitable.  I'd like to thank Ronni especially SO much for being so personal and taking great care of me. I've never been to a restaurant that seemed to so deeply care about making sure I was able to enjoy a meal with everyone else. I'm so used to places casting my needs aside because they are not able, or care to make an effort, to meet my need. Not only did I feel taken care of, it helped me enjoy the night stress free. THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Best waiter I've ever had! Ask for Harris!!!   We got there a little late, about half hour before they closed. We were very hungry and wanted a nice meal. The hostess said it was fine and sat us across from the beautiful fish tank.  Harris came up introduced himself and thanked us for coming in. He also made polite conversation with us as he gave us the specials. Excellent suggestions, we had a couple appetizers and two entrees. BTW try the mango mojito!!!   Long story short, Food was great! Service was excellent! Atmosphere was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Go figure....an outstanding restaurant at a hotel! I think hell just froze over.  Great food. Excellent service......great stop!"}
{"text":"The 75,000 gallon aquarium over the bar was the main draw for me to visit Chart House recently, and since it's a higher end Landry's property, I thought the food would be exceptional. Unfortunately, that was not the case on this visit  I started with the soup sampler and while the clam chowder was good, the gazpacho and lobster bisque were underwhelming. After waiting around 40 minutes for the pan seared scallops entree, I questioned the bartender and he admitted he forgot to tell the kitchen. It appeared 10 minutes later and seemed fresh, but the scallops were slightly undercooked and not browned enough for me.   Overall, a decent dish for the price paid, but not memorable. Possibly the fresh fish options are better than some dishes from the standard menu  I'll come back to try again soon, and also to enjoy the fantastic view of that fish tank"}
{"text":"Wow!  What an incredible turn around from a year and a half ago.  Never thought we'd go back but I'm loyal to Landrys so we gave it a shot.  Impeccable service from Jillian.  Great bartenders,managers, and excellent food from the chefs.  We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with Gwen on my visit to Vegas. This place is really nice!  Located inside the Golden Nugget but has a gorgeous fish tank right in the center...Food is nice!  I got the fish and chips and Gwen got the coconut shrimp...Really good with shoe string fries...You can also get a soup or side salad but I passed on that...I would definitely return to eat at this place next time I'm in town..."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in here on Christmas eve about 930 we were amazed by the awesome attentive service we got from Paul and his crew. This made our night just that much more special. All our food and cocktails and dessert came out in a timely manner and Paul was very personal with us. I would recommend the calamari which is tossed in a kimchee sauce it's why we decided to go out I had been craving it for months now. We also ordered the prime rib and my wife got her seafood dish. We ended the night with the chocolate lava cake which was good, we  also tried their house made peanut butter ice cream which by its self was good too rich for the lava cake though. We will defiantly be back and I would definitely recommend this place for all celebrating occasions."}
{"text":"Service was awesome.  They sat us in front of the Aquarium so we had a great view.  Drinks were good along with our appetizers which were oysters and a mango crab tower.  Had the seafood variety dishfor our entree, was just alright, but I still give this place a 5 star."}
{"text":"Eating fish, while watching fish swim by? Sure, why not!  We started with the crab, mango & avocado stack. It was ridic. Very good. Just watch out for those hidden jalapeños! I had the seared chilean sea bass that was stuffed with crab & lobster, because duh. The orzo that came with it was delicious, and the fish was so good. It definitely had 30 pounds of butter on it, but hey, I'm on vacation! My date/cousin had the macadamia crusted mahi, and damn it was good too.   There were so many things on the menu I wanted to eat, but neither my stomach nor my pocketbook are big enough to fit them all in.   The prices are definitely a little steep, but we were wanting to treat ourselves, so when in Rome (or, well, the Golden Nugget)!  Watch out for that giant green eel. He was eyeing my dish."}
{"text":"Talk about a phenomenal evening! Loved our window seats watching the gorgeous sunset while a Great Blue Heron, Geese and ducks swan in the huge lake. Josh excelled as he served our Caesar Salad, Macadamia Nut Mahi Mahi, Prime Rib and Lava Cake! The meals was melt in the mouth delicious!"}
{"text":"The price is high for what you get, but I still enjoy a good meal at the Chart House.  I've had several steaks here and have been pleased with all of them. We've thoroughly enjoyed the Chocolate Lava cake as well.  I certainly recommend that.  As others have said, the lake view is a nice touch.  The wait staff could use a little lightening up, and it wouldn't hurt to turn the lights up just a bit.  Who know though, maybe they're trying to target the 'My date's ugly but I want good food' crowd."}
{"text":"Was served by a very helpful and enthusiastic Harris.  He suggested some very good dishes, specifically the mahi-mahi and the shrimp and scallops.  Both were delicious.  And the chocolate lava cake was great."}
