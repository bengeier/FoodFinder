{"text":"Me: That was really good chicken.  Like really good. I should give them a favourable Yelp review.

Me to me: You will give them 2 stars. If they get too popular, there will be lineups."}
{"text":"Have only tried the one dish galbi-tine which was delicious. You have the option to have it on rice or fries. I had it on rice . It was really filling, portions could be shared. And the price only $10. I dined in and the joint was really neat and clean, left smelling like fried food though ."}
{"text":"Came here around 2:30pm on a Saturday and thankfully it wasn't too busy. I was super hyped to try their fried chicken, based on all of the positive reviews, but in the end, I was underwhelmed. We had the 5 piece chicken order ($15), that came with 3 drumsticks and 2 thighs, as well as an order of the kimchi cheese fries. Our order took about 10 minutes to arrive, and everything arrived fresh and hot. While the chicken was super crispy, not oily, and juicy on the inside, it tasted overwhelmingly of maple and was missing the spicy kick I was expecting. Maybe there just wasn't enough of the spicy sauce? 
The kimchi cheese fries were seasoned really well and the first few bites were great, until we got to the middle layer and realized there was no more gochujang mayo/kimchi/cheese for the rest of the fries. The remaining portion of fries was dry and we were sad that we had paid $7 for non-existent seasonings. 
Probably would not return."}
{"text":"WOW
Kaboom is awesome. We had delivery and even though not fresh from the kitchen the chicken was absolutely amazing.
Think crispy chicken, with a slightly spicy sweet sauce that has just the perfect amount of heat.
We had 5- piece, the waffle, and a side order of fries.

all were excellent, will order again for sure. This is a great spot."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  The chicken itself was good, with a thick crunchy batter that wasn't greasy at all.  However, I could have used a lot more of the delicious sweet and spicy sauce on it - maybe you could ask for that.  For $10 you get a thigh and drum, some french fries and a little thing of coleslaw.  The fries were so-so.  I was hoping for something a lot more like the kimchi fries they have Banh Mi Boys, but these were basically just not-so-great fries with a bit of some kind of powdered seasoning.  The coleslaw was vinegary and unexciting.  Why not serve kimchi instead of bad coleslaw?  And how about a squeeze bottle of gochujang so you can load up your meal with some spicy delicious Korean flavour?"}
{"text":"Best chicken in Toronto. My daughter loooooves the taro chips too. I have tried everything on the menu (it's an addiction) and I have no complaints. Just high, high praises. The food and service are really phenomenal. Thank you for bringing some badass bite to Toronto!"}
{"text":"First time at this place. Fried chicken has never tasted this good!! Waaay better than Popeyes. Service was good, food was ready very quick. Even though they forgot to give me 10% off when I called in due to the promotional error on their website, they apologized and took down my info so next time I visit they will rectify it.

Definitely will be going back and recommending!"}
{"text":"This is the best chicken sandwich i have ever had. If they end up delivering I'm doomed."}
{"text":"Maybe I visited on a off day, but my chicken was over cooked and dry, the Kimchi Rice Ball was very salty , and I had to throw it out after the first bite.

The place was very smokey and either needed better ventilation or they burned something (my chicken order?)

Indifferent staff at the cash was unhelpful and bored."}
{"text":"Food: If you like your chicken extra crispy, moist and  drenched with spicy Korean sauce, you'll love the food here. They offer some unique fusion dishes and fast food options. 
The egg waffles are tasty and a bit denser than the ones you get at pacific mall. I wish we asked for sauce on the side for this dish so our waffle wouldn't have gotten soft. Hand cut fries are well cooked and seasoned for extra kick. The popcorn chicken ($3) and pork lettuce wraps (2 for $5) were also very tasty and crunchy. 

Price: entree combos are reasonably priced. Some of the appetizers are a great deal. 

Service: very friendly at the counter

Atmosphere: Casual self-serve with picnic tables and benches. More of a take-out restaurant that is ok for kids. 

For the owners: the coleslaw was a bit plain and very small. Can you use more ingredients to add more dynamic flavours?"}
{"text":"Awesome food and very reasonably priced!  Lunch here yesterday and The fried chicken sandwich is out of this world. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a huge fan of fried chicken, but I have to make an exception for Kaboom: their Korean style fried chicken is delicious: just a hint of heat and a lot of crunch, served piping hot from the fryer. The seasoned fries are also good, especially with the chili mayo."}
{"text":"This was third visit and I really enjoy their pork belly sandwich and I love their fries."}
{"text":"Just came in for a Chicken Sandwich To Go 
I inhaled it. lol I Might have to come back for another one. 
Will definitely be coming back. 
Great Sandwich Chicken crispy great tangy sauce crunchy slaw what's not to like."}
{"text":"Chicken was super crispier and moist in the inside. Fries were good ... Perhaps a little on the seasoned/salt side."}
{"text":"Love it, who don't love fried chicken with spicy source? Also try their ramen burger is good!"}
{"text":"I came here on impulse, having just gotten off the King streetcar on Queen and Broadview. It has a welcoming atmosphere and a youthful vibe.  For a first timer like me, the lady at the counter suggested the fried drumstick and thigh on fries.  The bill was a reasonable amount and when my order came, I was blown away by how delicious it was (e.g., Kaboom!).  The outside of each piece was very, very crisp with a coating of hot and sweet sauce while the inside was tender and juicy.  After this, I asked myself, how could I go back to Popeye's or KFC?  The only complaint I have is that it's hard to eat the chicken without using both hands. So you can't eat while scrolling on your phone."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday shortly after the restaurant opened.  The seating was cafeteria-style and we had no trouble finding seats for our group of around 10.  I ordered the 2 pieces meal and added ~$2 to turn the fries into \"kim-cheese\" fries.  The portion size is quite substantial and I was not able to finish all the fries despite coming from dragonboat practice.  The chicken was not really your typical \"KFC\"-style - all in all it was okay - chicken was crispy and wasn't dry, but the sauce just didn't quite hit the spot.  The \"kim-cheese\" fries were also just okay - it didn't have quite enough kimchi or cheese."}
{"text":"I have seen so many pics for this place on Instagram and finally had the chance to come here. 

The seating are limited with a few bench like seatings and 1 washroom. We ordered the popular items such as the thigh and drum Korean fried chicken and the sandwich version for about $11 each. I have to say that I have never had anything like it, it's definately not like KFC. The chicken skin is seasoned very well with diff types of spices and it is super crispy like a chip.

I like how you can grab your own utensils, take out boxes, and water that is flavoured with real lemons."}
{"text":"I give Kaboom chicken 4/5 stars solely based on their fried chicken. It was juicy, hot, perfect balance of spicy and sweet, and had the  CRISPIEST fried chicken skin I've had in Toronto.

The galbi-tine: Kaboom chicken's take on the Korean classic Galbi-jiim (braised beef) was dissapointing. The meat was pulled off the bone and served over mushy rice (too much water). The pickled carrots had too much acidity and it over-powered the dish. But hey, you're at a fried chicken joint, so I don't mind this.

The fries were fresh cut, and well-seasoned, however I would prefer them crispier! The kimchi mayo and other gochujang sauce they had were perfect for dipping the fries in.

5 pieces of fried chicken $15
Galbi-tine rice bowl $10
Fries $3.50

Overall 4/5 stars"}
{"text":"Had the egg bubble with two fried chicken pieces on top. The bubble egg waffle was better than expected, I really like how they added chives. The fried chicken however was okay, the only flavour really was the sweet chilli sauce on the outside on the skin. However would recommend to try atleast once."}
{"text":"Kaboom! The fried chicken is crispy and delicious. I love the mix of Korean flavours in the side dishes. The corn on the cob and tacos are awesome. It's affordable. It's delicious. The staff are great. I love the easy going vibe."}
{"text":"Very relaxed place. Chicken was incredible, but the star of the show was the kimcheesy fries! Definitely a great intro to Korean fried chicken if you've not tried it."}
{"text":"We went today around 2:30 (Saturday) and there was 1 person. Menu looked good so we decided to try the pork sandwich with taro chips instead of fries. It was Ok taste wise but was very fatty. Chips were good. 
We also had the fried chicken which seemed dry and not greasy from the outside but unfortunately was also very dry and not moist on the inside despite not being the breast. Fries were not good. 
Popcorn chicken was ok but greasy. 
The food was so greasy/heavy that we spent the rest of the day feeling bad. 
Will not return."}
{"text":"KABOOM came highly recommended for the real deal as far as deep fried chicken, Korean style, goes and it delivered! 
Situated on the north side of Queen St. just east of Broadview, KABOOM is part of an explosion of new businesses in a tired run-down strip. Forget about the area appearing sketchy after dark, now a slow buzz of bars, entertainment and restaurants fills the vacuum left by dives and strips bars. 
KABOOM has the typical new resto layout with a long shared table smack in the middle of the front room with smaller spots slammed against the wall which has menus plastered above.
Everything looks clean and swanky with the bright and welcoming order counter at the back with the roomy and clean washrooms opening up to the side. Since they specialize in deep frying expect the typical fast-food ooze of grease in the air and coating everything including the floor -- a sure sign of the fryers keeping up to the demand of the delectable fried chicken pieces, drumsticks and thighs. And if it's a cold day, be cautioned that there is no double door so you could get hit by a wall of cold weather if someone pops it open. For us, the fresh air was welcome!
I had a taste of the rice balls and French fries, as well as the pork belly sammy which were fine, but the chicken, O my! It is so good, and when going back I'm going to focus on it with my appetite. Sure there are other things on the menu but they KNOW how to cook KFC. One bite will tell you that, and every bite after will affirm your satisfaction. The crust is crispy, almost like a shell with a slightly sweet, maple-syrup like flavour which I didn't find overly spicy. Then, you're met with a hot n' steamy, tender inside. Best yet, they know how to deep fry so the meat is cooked through to the bone, yet there is no dryness or blandness that comes with overcooking. Geniuses, all of them!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for just pieces of chicken. It was some crispy goodness. I liked the sauce outside but the chicken itself was not as flavourful/salty enough."}
{"text":"I've had takeout from Kaboom a couple of times now. Every time, the chicken has been the winner. It's delicious. They put a lot of sauce on it so I like to get the sauce on the side. The fries are a little on the soft/soggy side, especially as takeout. Cheesy-kimchee fries suffer from this soggyness but the concept is good. They would probably be ok in the restaurant. Rice balls and pork belly lettuce wraps are nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Can I say no to fried chicken? No, I simply can't. Off we go on another Korean fried chicken adventure, this time to Kaboom on Queen East. It's a small venue with high ceilings and big windows. Not a great location for big groups, but we did anyway....we may have taken over a little. (Apologies. :D) 

We ordered almost everything on the menu. Let start with the obvious, fried chicken! The chicken was hot and fresh. The cook was trying their best to keep up with our group plus their regular customers that were streaming in. Batter was crisp, but the real flavour came from the sauce. At least the sauce explains where the name of the restaurant came from! A burst of the sweet chilli sauce sent me into a coughing fit. Oops! Didn't expect that kind of kick! A little embarrassing, but I pulled through. I'm not a spicy gal, so this is not unusual. :P 

Our table ordered a bunch of side orders. The french fries that came with the chicken were not great. They didn't seem to be cooked enough, took thick. Taro chips were circulating our table; even those had a sprinkle of heat on them. Pretty good! The rice balls were good and cheesy, hard to share though, but that's not their fault! They come 2 per order.  I was also lucky enough to steal a piece of a bubble waffle and it was damn good. Everyone that ordered sandwiches said they were great too.  

Service was good, but a bit slow since it was so busy! That's not a bad thing! The chicken speaks for itself."}
{"text":"This was the BEST fried chicken I've ever tasted!!! My husband and I each got a fried chicken & waffle. The chicken is so crispy and flavourful, and the waffle is soft with some slight sweetness - a perfect balance of flavour and texture. The atmosphere is nice and chill, and I love the art they have on display. I just wish it was located closer to where I live. ;) Next expansion at the West End?"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious and probably the best fried chicken in town! Do yourself a favour and try everything on their menu."}
{"text":"Crispy chicken that's not oily. Must try. Went on a Friday night in feb. Steady traffic flow but no line up to order and didn't wait more 7 mins for the fresh chicken to come out. Ordered the 2 piece wings and fries for $12. These are jumbo entire wings and eight the fries make a good meal. That said I think I'll order the 5 piece for $15 next time. Seating is limited but turn over is fast."}
{"text":"KABOOM! No, I wasn't just hit by Adam West's Batman, but by this completely new take on Korean Fried Chicken (KFC). The more I have KFC, the less I can define what it actually is, since I've had radically different approaches to it at the few places I've visited.

First off, KABOOM's may be the crispiest fried chicken I've had. I swear their vat of oil must be nearly bubbling over as the skin is so crispy (but not burned) that it keeps high temperature locked into the chicken several minutes after being served. Someone told me that their leftovers were still warm when they returned home an hour after visiting this place - and I'd believe it. Needless to say, the crunch of the skin is very satisfying too, especially if texture matters to you like it does for me.

The chilli sauce is very unique too. It has a bit of kick, but not as hot as it may appear. Lots of taste too it and surprisingly (but not overly) sweet - very likely from maple syrup. The maple syrup highlights the fact that this place is undoubtably fusion. The kimchi fries are essentially a Korean take at poutine. They have Kimchi rice balls, and I'm willing to bet that those aren't traditional, and likely a take on the Italian ones. The rice balls, btw, were fantastic. I tried a few other things with the group, including the fried chicken sandwich was was an easy hit. The galbi beef on rice was perhaps the most 'traditional' item I tried, and it was very good, and they didn't slack on it, since it was undoubtedly marinated for hours in advance.

About the only 'meh' part of it was the fries. They weren't bad and were fresh-cut, but they still didn't do it for me. When I return, I'd probably make a point of getting rice for my side, which still pairs perfectly with fried chicken.

Still, lots of high points here and they've done a great job of executing what they were after. Nice open spot too with nice service."}
{"text":"I came here for the chicken and the first bite was heavenly, but then I realized that the \"sauce\" does not cover the chicken at all, and is really applied in a single stroke with a brush. Without the sauce, it really is just plain fried chicken, and I've had better versions of that at Stockyards. Coleslaw was white and hard, covered with vinegar and not much else. I made a trip just to try it, unfortunately, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love fried chicken.  I love Korean fried chicken.  Kaboom makes it great.

Personally I've been trying to find good KFC here in Toronto.  It's been a personal mission of mine ever since June of 2015 because I was introduced to KFC for the first time in NYC and I've been trying to chase the KFC equivalent dream here in TO. 

While I've been to a handful of places downtown, uptown, Koreatown, Koreatown north and west side, I haven't been completely blown away by any offering of KFC in the GTA until now.

Yes, Kaboom just blew my mind.  It's that good, plain and simple.  While I've had my trials and mild successes and some epic failures of trying to find good KFC in TO this place is HANDS DOWN the best that I've had right here at home.  While it may not be on the same pedestal as where I place Turntable Chicken Jazz (my fav in NYC) I can safely say that this is without a doubt the best all around KFC representation for what is available in Toronto and the surrounding area that I've been to.  While you have your more traditional style runner ups like Cheers at Yonge and Finch or K-Pop in Etobicoke, this Queen and Broadview up and comer is essentially my current go to place for what is the best KFC in my books.  Kaboom has been open for less than 2 months at this point.

What makes it so great?  That's a good question... here I am just going on and on for how good the product is but what makes it good?  What is so good about it?  In order to explain what makes it good I have to compare it to what others offer so you can know what the difference is in this version of KFC.  Typically I've found in TO KFC places, generally the batter is thinner and not as thick.  In a recipe that my wife found and makes, the batter is light and thinner than what Kaboom produces.  This has been referred to in the past as \"eggshell batter\" in reference to being as thin as an eggshell.  

Kaboom makes their batter slightly on the heavier side, so it's thicker, but not necessarily pure crunchy type like \"extra crispy\" type of crunch.  It has a good bite that is the chicken skin gets a good cooking and fry but the chicken in not overcooked, dry or overdone.  The meat is juicy but cooked fully and the pieces are essentially drumsticks and thighs on the dark meat side and unsplit wings on the \"white\" meat side.  Unsplit wings are important to mention because the only other place I've seen wings in the KFC variety served like this was at Crisp in Chicago.  There is to me a bit of similarity to how Crisp serves and how Kaboom has their chicken besides the fact that unsplit wings cook a certain way not to mention the batter to surface ratio is changed when they are not split (drumlet and flat as one piece as opposed to two).

Between ordering both 5 and 7 piece orders, the 7 piece includes 2 unsplit wings, 2 thighs, 2 drumsticks and another piece.  The 5 had one unsplit wing and 2 of each thigh and drumstick.

The batter and the integrity of the batter Kaboom presents retains its crisp/crunch factor.  This is VERY important in fact it's one of the things I prioritize as a KFC seeker and lover.  I cannot say how much I am disappointed when fried chicken is drenched in sauce to the point that it loses its crispy/crunch texture because of the outer coating absorbing copious amounts of superfluous sauce which ultimately makes the meal a soggy and dripping wet mess.  That is a complete turn off for me and thankfully Kaboom does not do this.  

Kaboom while adding their wonderfully robust and flavorful sauce do NOT overdo it.  The amount of sauce is essentially \"just right\" to use the Goldilocks analogy.  The fried chicken while having sauce does not drown, does not become soggy nor does it take away from the chicken itself.  The sauce as referred to by Katie K as \"Gochujang\" is a spicy somewhat sweet compliment that adds to the explosive and unpredictability of great flavor and texture that Kaboom's fried chicken presents.  

I like this chicken, I like it a lot.  So far I've been to this establishment 2 Fridays in a row and I can say that I'm rather infatuated but I think I want to marry this one.  

While there are other offerings such as pork belly sandwiches and some burger on ramen or something like that it's rather obvious that the hallmark of this place is their fried chicken.

I hadn't asked but I'm guessing if you'd prefer to not have the sauce you'd have to ask.  So far there is only one sauce that is presently being served.  There are currently no beer or alcohol presently being served whether there are plans or not to have that I do not know.

I brought my brother and his friend for their first KFC experience just this past Friday and both were very impressed.  I can say that even after I've had my fair share of Korean fried chicken in the past year and change that I too am very much impressed with the fried chicken served at Kaboom. 

Between Kaboom and Descendant Pizza, I now have yet another reason to cross the Don Valley."}
{"text":"So my opinion is that if youre already a fan of Korean flavors you'll like this place. As a huge fried chicken fan and someone that hates kimchi I can only say that the quality of ingredients were good but that I wasn't a fan of the overall taste. Chicken was tender and moist and the fries (plain) were great. The 4th star is for the sole fact that the cashier saw that I was eyeing my car concerned about getting a parking ticket and offered to bring it out to me. That's service that deserves some applause."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I wanted to try this place. Mind you I have  little knowledge  on how Korean Fried Chicken  (KFC )  is supposed  to taste like but I know what I like in fried chicken

The batter is key in getting that cruch you want with  each  bite and Kaboom did that.  I when  with 5 piece  and for about 15 buck  isn't want bad, it was filling.  You got an assortment too  two unsplit  wings  two drumstick and a thigh piece.


On top  that  cruch and the tender meat below the sauce was good. It was sweet with a bit of kick of hear but it wasn't spicy. It had a good balance of sweet and hot which I liked. Definitely  got to check out other KFC spots"}
{"text":"The chicken and kimchi fries are delicious. 

Sometimes I wish the chicken came with more sauce but then you risk ruining the crispness of the chicken. It's a fine balance. 

I've tried the taco, spicy rice balls and the taro chips. They were all a disappointment, especially the rice balls and taro chips. 

Just stick to the chicken and fries. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My KABOOM review...

Ordered take out...

Chicken was great but if you are concerned about the spice/kaboom had it on the side.

Fries were soggy and spicy as well but we had take out. I'd probably skip it next time.

The kimchi rice balls were just okay...not my food choices.  .I think I'd rather try the pork belly wrap next time."}
{"text":"Service at the counter was friendly and helpful. Clean washroom and eating area. I ordered the chicken and waffles. 

The food came out in timely fashion. The chicken was a bit burnt and dry unfortunately. The HK waffles were a little sweeter than usual (P-Mall or from Chinatown) but the sauce poured over top is fantastic. My other gripe was NOT ENOUGH SAUCE on the chicken, I would have liked an extra side of sauce. 

My coworker ordered the ramen burger, he enjoyed it, a little too hard to eat with hands. The taro chips served on the side were very tasty too. 

Water is available if you don't want a pop.

It's more of a 3.5 rating."}
{"text":"Let's Get Real
_____________

I will give an unbiased review of this restaurant.  Too many people writing in are shills or worse, they have no taste.  

First of all, I doubt very much that many people here writing positive reviews would even know what top notch fried chicken is all about ... Korean or otherwise.  The average persons basis for comparison is KFC.  As a Canadian who has travelled extensively through the U.S., rest assured, when you have tasted the real McCoy, it is a moment of pure and unadulterated bliss!  Time stops and you are one with the universe.  Foodies understand that even when it comes to ordinary fried chicken.

Kaboom did nothing special to enhance my taste buds when I had their chicken leg and thigh combo.  What they did achieve was taking my money and giving very little value in return. Regretfully, that spells doom for most restaurant entrepreneurs."}
{"text":"Kaboom Chicken is a restaurant located in Riverdale that is a fusion between Korean culture and Western culture with a focus on fried chicken. It's an interesting addition to the Riverdale area, it's a hipsterish place that you would see in Kensington Market.

I have been to the place a few times to ensure that the food was consistent before I wrote this review. I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken (5 pieces for $15 plus tax) and Kimchee Cheesy Fries ($7 plus tax) each time. The Korean Fried Chicken is really good, nicely seasoned, nice crisp skin without being too oily and juicy tender meat on the inside and a slathering of a sweet chili sauce on the top which is quite good. The Kimchee Cheesy Fries were pretty good, nice fresh cut fries, nicely seasoned and covered with cheese, kimchee, green onions and gochojang drizzle. 

The place isn't too big and there is a large picnic table in the middle of the restaurant and some seats on the side for seating. It's a self serve restaurant where you make an order and when your order is ready, you pick up your food upfront.

When you come to Kaboom Chicken, the star of the show is the Korean Fried Chicken, it's really well done and reasonably priced and keep in mind that Korean Fried Chicken is different than say North American Fried Chicken, so don't expect that same type of taste or seasoning but it's really good nonetheless. It's a really great addition to the Riverdale area."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the chicken here since they've opened.  I normally go there a couple of times a week.  But no more.
If a business has to raise prices, that's something that happens.  Normally you just say costs have risen and leave it at that.
But to give excuses that include a political rant is just not done.
So I shall not be coming here.  I might have to go a little further afield to find my chicken.  But when I do I can concentrate on eating and not politics.
Lastly; my parents always taught me never to talk about politics, religion or money in polite company."}
{"text":"BOOM! Kaboom Chicken is dynamite. I feel almost guilty for saying this but their chicken is even better than authentic Korean fried chicken joints in the city. I was so pleasantly surprised by this place I have to give it five stars. This is fusion fried chicken done perfectly.

I first came here with a good friend on a Friday evening and there wasn't anyone here which was odd at the time but even more odd now that I know how good their chicken is. Come down and you won't regret it. 

We shared a simple two piece chicken meal which came with fries, a bit of coleslaw, gochujang mayo, and gochujang sauce. It was a complete meal, and I just loved having those sauces. The mayo was just perfect with their fries and the gochujang you could also dip with their fries or slobber more onto your chicken which was lightly dressed (just the way I like it, as it still retains most of the crispiness). 

The chicken was served piping hot. When you cut it and see all that steam, you just know that chicken was going to be moist and it was. Some of the juiciest and freshest chicken I have ever had! The skin was perfectly crispy still and I loved the texture and breading they use here at kaboom. It's relatively light and powdery, yet still delivering a satisfying crunch. 

Their fries was also incredible. Skin-on, hand-cut, long fries (none of those small bits) and there's some light spices on top (Cajun like?) - just the way it should be. 

Water, utensils, and everything is self-serve which was awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing and tasty chicken fried! Taro fries is so good! The Nodles Chicken Fried Burger! Is so delicious! I will come back to try pork belly sandwich and rice balls! Good prices Burguer and Juice 18$! Really good size! Very clean place! Casual and informal! Close to the TTC! Nice service!"}
{"text":"Tried their tacos this time. Be prepared to get messy. I had to drain out a good amount of juice from pickled veggies before taking the first bite. I could tell they make their own tortillas (soft) here based on the shape. With that being said, they are extremely fragile. It was not easy to eat these tacos with juice dripping and tortillas falling apart. BUT I did enjoy them. They were quite generous with meat and garnishes. Meat was packed with flavor and tender. Two was enough for me, but I would have gone for the third one only if I didn't have dinner planned four hours later. My bf had the same thing (two pieces and an egg waffle). He said it was as good as last time. 

I would recommend fried chickens, but tacos are still good alternatives if you are not up for a heavy meal."}
{"text":"Came here around 2pm sih for some good wholesome chicken. Its very good. Its not greasy at all and the sauce that comes with the chicken is wonderful.

The kimchi fries are very delicious. The kimchi there is also one of the better kimchis I've had. Overall its a solid place for great fried chicken. As pricey as (I feel at least) it is, its very good and I'd spend the money for it (koreean fried chicken tends to be more expensive )."}
{"text":"Finallly got to try this new Chicken restaurant. I've been waiting with great anticipation for this new restaurant on Broadview and Queen. I was So satisfied by the taste of this chicken. I had the 2 piece combo with fries and coleslaw. The gochujang mayo was nice treat for dipping both fries and Chicken. With the sweet chili sauce smothering the crispy Chicken , absolutely enhances the flavour of Chicken. I looking for to try the Ramen FC burger next. A great new addition to the Toronto restaurant scene. Best of luck to you!!"}
{"text":"Got the 7 pieces of fried chicken and fries. Chicken was delicious and gone in no time. The fries weren't my favourite (too thick and spicy), but others might love them."}
{"text":"With the opening of Kaboom in Riverside, central Toronto has a reliable source of great takeout Korean fried chicken. It is a very great change of taste/nice addition in the evolving food scene in the east end Queen East strip. A couple bites on their crispy, juicy, spicy bangin' chicken, and KABOOM! The fries are packing with flavours too. They make everything to order so everything is hotter than that crummy big brand chain with the same acronym will ever be.

The most insane thing they got is their chicken ramen burger. Which might sound tame and ridiculous at the same time, but hear me out: two pieces of dried freshly made fried ramen noodle pucks (nope, not the instant stuff) serving as the bun for what turned out to be a massively sized monstrous thing once you see how big the chicken in between is. I thought it looked a lot like the tsukemen noodle monster (Portlandia season 6).

Try not to self-destruct over their great food and service.

[TTC: peck your way on a 501-2-3 or King streetcar to Queen/Broadview]"}
{"text":"I came here with my friends for lunch and honestly I wasn't completely satisfied. I ordered the kimcheesy fries which is basically their version of kimchi fries. It was a pretty decent portion but that was probably the only good part about it. 

The fries were kinda hard?? and I was literally struggling to pick them up with my fork. Also the cheddar cheese they melted on top of the fries solidified very quickly and became a thick, salty, overwhelming wall on top of my food. In general I didn't really like my food, it kinda had a weird after taste as well. 

I don't understand why this place didn't offer chopsticks to eat the food with, especially since it's a \"korean\" inspired restaurant. It would've been much easier (and more authentic?) to eat my food with chopsticks -- this is especially true since they also offer rice bowls.

Keep in mind that this place is more of a korean fusion restaurant and not an authentic korean fried chicken restaurant. There wasn't a single word actually written in korean on the menu, but I guess that just shows what kind of place this is. 

If you're looking for some kimchi fries that are actually good (10/10 imo) check out banh mi boys!!"}
{"text":"Boom pop wow...Kaboom!  Korean Fried Chicken is calling your name...and you better answer!

Came here on a Friday night with a group of friends to see what the fuss was about!  Glad I did cuz it was a delicious night.

Our table ordered a few things - the chicken, kimchi rice balls, fried chicken and (bubble) waffles, the chicken sandwich, fries...actually I think we ended up trying most things on their menu!

The chicken is piece of hot...errr....well it's hot and juicy and flavourful with a hint of sweetness and crispness.  I thoroughly enjoyed eating it.  The pieces are quite big so one order of the 5 piece is good for 2.   

The kimchi rice balls were heaven.  It's similar to the Italian arracinhi balls but oh so much better.  I'm dreaming of these balls in my mouth right about now (hehe).

I had bites of the sandwich and there was a rice dish as well - both were flavourful without being heavy or overwhelming.

I also ordered the fried chicken (bone in) and the bubble waffles.  I'd get this again - it was so good!  The slight saltiness of the chicken paired nicely with the slight sweetness of the waffles (much prefer the bubble waffle over regular waffles)

This is a small space with not a lot of seating.  There was a line up for take out and deliveries via Foodora.  So be prepared to potentially wait...but it's sooooooo worth it."}
{"text":"Maybe I'd like this more if I were 9..
Take out had way to much sauce, container greasy and stunk up the car.
Fries too much salt. Obviously not a healthy meal.  I don't like the chicken either. Disappointing overall."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is pretty interesting.

We came here for the novelty of the Ramen Burger, but we're definitely going to come back to try the other things they offer.

With the ramen burger, if you upgrade your taro chips that come with the burger to kimchi cheesy fries, it only costs $2 more, and it's totally worth it. They are really good.

The Ramen FC Burger: the chicken was juicy and perfectly seasoned. I'm trying that on its own next time. Honestly wasn't too big of a fan of the ramen 'buns', towards the end of the burger, but overall the burger was pretty good! I am a fan of the sauces they give you. The bibimbap toppings give it great texture and balances out the oiliness of the chicken and the heaviness of the ramen buns

We also got the popcorn chicken, and it was pretty good, but it was VERY small. When the dude at the cash told us it was a really tiny portion he really meant it! Anyway, the sauce was very tasty but it made the tiny chicken pieces soggy very quickly. But I'm not sure if it was because the chicken had been sitting around for a tiny bit because it wasn't super hot when it was given us. It also came with real popcorn at the end, which was a tasty treat even though it was meant to be a filler so they don't have to give you as much chicken.

We heard that the pork belly sandwich and the chicken on it's own are really good, so we'll be trying that next time!

The guy at the cash was sooo nice! He also seemed super dorky. Thanks for being friendly and making our visit a good experience! :)"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely amazing.... always my go-to! Staff are super friendly! Definitely recommend if you're in the Leslieville area."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness if you want juicy and crispy chicken and a decent price! You need to visit Kaboom chicken. My mind was blown with how juicy and flavourful the chicken was! The fries were also delicious, I think they had some seasoning on it! I would 100% go back, I've been recommending it to everyone! I got the two piece fried chicken with fries and coleslaw and the sandwich as well. They give you a side of mayo that isn't just mayo, it is something more and so good!!! I coated my fries in it!"}
{"text":"Upon entering was greeted by a lovely lady at the register.  She asked me if it was my first time there and had suggested to me some of there top sellers. 

I ordered the chicken sandwich, which was one of the best I've had! The chicken was thigh meat and not breast which was lovely, usually I find breast dry so this thigh was perfectly moist. The sandwich was served with house slaw (normally, I don't put too much faith in slaw.. this there slaw was perfect!), and sandwiched between a crusty baguette.  

Accompanied with spiced fries (which were crispy) and gochujang mayo.  

The music was at a good sound level and staff were welcoming, I'd go back again!"}
{"text":"Good but not great.  First time there so i ordered a variety of things.  The hot sauce on the rice balls are spicy but not flavourful.  Just hot.  All similar sauce pretty much on everything.   The fried chicken was pretty good.  Probably will go back and just stick to the 2 piece chicken combo."}
{"text":"Mmmmm korean fried chicken. I am a huge fan of this place. It is super cute inside, although small, with a nice ambience. The wait time for us was over 30 minutes but I believe that was probably just because we had a pretty large order (18 pieces of chicken + some sides). The wait was definitely worth it though! The fried chicken was so crispy, yet light, and perfectly juicy. It was not overwhelming unlike most fried chicken. I had 2 thighs though and that was definitely not filling enough as the pieces are quite small. 

The sides were not that great. The corn was not very flavourful and didn't taste that fresh. The french fries were also ok - although they were nice and hot they weren't crispy and could have used a few more minutes in the fryer. Our taro chips were not good at all - they were burnt. If we had actually ate in the restaurant rather than getting it to go, we definitely would have complained about that. And finally - the bubble waffle was a disappointment. Our bubble waffle was ripped into the circles which I found weird and the batter was not light tasting. Besides the ok sides the korean fried chicken is well worth a visit to Kaboom!"}
{"text":"KFC ... Korean fried chicken ... amazing concept, and certainly better than KFC.  The chicken is delicious, albeit a touch on the sweet side for me.  Great fries, but guys, what's with every resto in the city mailing it in with their sides?  

The bibimbap corn on the cob sounds ... interesting?  But it's literally a vinegary side salad - vinegary zucchini, tofu, etc - on a grilled piece of corn on the cob.  Hard to eat, and a waste of both items ... I just pretended the toppings were a small salad and enjoyed them that way.  A thimble-full of coleslaw is also sort of pointless ... although given how little effort was put into the coleslaw, I get it.  

Minus one star for the sides."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was really delicious. Spice level was perfect. Also had the \"kimcheesy\" fries and popcorn chicken, which were also sooooo good. 

Chill atmosphere, friendly service. Prices are reasonable.

Queen and Broadview is a little out of the way for us but I'm glad we came. There's a green P parking lot just north of Queen, on the east side of Broadview, if you're driving. 

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Damn. I think I'm in fried chicken heaven...CRISPY Korean fried chicken that is! Thank you for recommending...Lambert P! :)

Came here on a Friday night with my fiancé and we were super excited to try, what some might it call the best kfc in Toronto or the whole GTA....hmmm

The place is hip-ishly decorated with a large communal table, big booth chairs and high stools, Very toronto-esque.

 We approached the cashier and ordered the Chicken and Waffles aka bubble cakes (I prefer over waffles), taro chips, pork belly sandwhich (to share) and chicken with fries.
The cashier told us it would take 20 mins as they were busy and their kfc are made to order. 

Our taro chips came out first and I wasn't a big fan of it. The garlic spice was overwhelmingly bitter almost burnt garlic taste. I would get an odd chip that's not heavily spiced and it tasted great. Our chicken dinners and pork belly sandwhich finally came out.... HUGE PORTION SIZE is all I can say! But we never waste, so we got to work.

The moment I sank my teeth in their kfc,  I immediately felt and heard the crunch...I instantly fell in love! The marinade was great, the chicken is juicy and fresh...and did I mention super crispy?! Omg. I like how they don't over sauce the chicken like most kfc joints do. That's a big problem for me...it's a big turn off when a crispy chicken skin is soggy due to drowning it in sauce. I'm not sure what type of sauce the chefs from kaboom added on their kfc but it's spicy but not alarming and it has a great dimension of flavours that showcase sweetness and the savoury side.
The fries were okay to me but my fiancé LOVED IT!
Now the pork belly, it was tasty and juicy. I love me some pork belly but I would share this sandwhich it's huge and rich.

Overall my experience was a great one! Believe the Hype"}
{"text":"Fried chicken is excellent here. Great flavour, right texture, and juicy. Would definitely come back for the chicken. 
Other sides were okay but not worth coming back for, popcorn chicken was a good snack and if I were closer might venture in to get once in awhile. Fried rice balls were nice flavour, crispy on the outside and all rice on the inside and not much else. Kimchi fries were a bit of a let down based on fry texture - the sauce and kimchi on top were excellent, the cheese was not really noticeable, but the fries were definitely overcooked for my liking. 
They do what they are known for well - fried chicken. Next time I would try different sides."}
{"text":"Excellent fried chicken, but their egg waffles are to die for! Very nice service too which is important. I would highly recommend this place as it's a very chill spot to fulfill your korean fried chicken cravings."}
{"text":"\"What,\" I asked myself, \"is Korean fried chicken?\" I noticed this place for the first time a few weeks ago while waiting outside for the streetcar. As I was reading the menu on the door, a girl came out, saw me standing there and said, \"Mmmm...yummy yummy Korean fried chicken.\" Well, that's an endorsement if I ever heard one. So a few days later I went in and picked some up. And well...hello, my new favourite food. Why didn't anyone tell me???"}
{"text":"I've been back a couple of times since my last review and it's not as shiny as it used to be. I find the fried chicken to be greasier and smaller than before. I used to leave with a feeling of warmth and satisfaction but now I leave feeling kinda gross, like I shouldn't have eaten this."}
{"text":"Had chicken and bubble waffles both times. First time -had a food orgasm in my mouth. Couldn't wait to go back. Second time the chicken was much smaller, there were no sauce on top as the first time. Got a bit dissapointed. Will give it one more try at least."}
{"text":"hands down best fried chicken in the whole world. ignore what people are saying about the portion size cause once you finish here you'll just understand."}
{"text":"The chicken was delicious but the value was atrocious - a piece of chicken thigh is typically the size of the palm of your hand, but here it was the size of a McNugget. The drumstick was the size of a chicken wing drum, not a drumstick. Makes me wonder: what kind of bird is this coming from?  See my picture. 

The kimcheese fries were worth the $2 supplement, but with a $2 can of pop, there wasn't much change from a $20 bill.  The \"kimchi fries\" at banh mi boys are still the champ in the Asian fusion fries department."}
{"text":"The chicken is juicy and tasty but the sauce makes the chicken soggy, fast. I didn't think the fries were anything special.

My favorite was the fried chicken sandwich. Very full-flavor and delicious! Again slightly soggy, which was a little off-putting. 

Overall a good tasting bite, but make sure you get the chicken hot and fresh, and eat it quickly before anything gets soggy!"}
{"text":"Super yummy food! Egg waffle is super flavourful. Their spicy mayo sauce is so addicting. Try their taro chips!!! Just the right amount of salt. Cute self serving area including water, napkins, utensils. Nice decor!"}
{"text":"After much anticipation, I was really disappointed with my visit to Kaboom. 

We were greeted and had our order taken by a friendly employee, but the food was barely edible...

Wings/Thighs - they are on to something with the recipe for their sauce - some kind of variation on honey garlic. I am not a fan of honey garlic, and the chicken skin was kind of mushy and chicken don't feel the highest quality. 

Fries - seemed like they could have been good, but not sure ours were cooked properly and found some raw ones. 

Pork Belly Taco - normally a huge fan of pork belly, his was bland and tasteless. Completely tasteless. We each tried a bite then didn't eat any more. The taco didn't stay together either. 

Price - it wasn't cheap either. 

Sprite was good. 

Not sure what to say. We were very surprised by how disappointing everything was."}
{"text":"Crispiest chicken in Toronto.
This place isn't the cheapest but the chicken has that crunch that I can't find in many places on the planet. As such, I have cravings for it from time to time. It's always worth the trip but the parking is tough."}
{"text":"Excellent fried chicken that stays crispy when not served right away. 
The fries are fresh cut and tasty. Kimchi fries are even better. 
The KFC chicken sandwich was really good as well, but should clearly have a different name."}
{"text":"Perfection.  Amazing Korean flavours pack a punch.  I had the ramen fried chicken burger - incredible flavour and texture.  Lots of thought put I to the dishes all the way down to the red bean ketchup dip for fries.  Will be back 100."}
{"text":"Got the 5 piece and the kimchi fries.  Wow this place is awesome the chicken is so crispy it's unlike any other KFC place I've been to and I've tried a couple in north York too.  The sauce is what sets this place apart. It is a very thick and fragrant coating that doesn't over power the rest of the chicken and really makes this place a hit.  Service is quick and prompt too.  Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Perfect Valentine's dinner for chill couple. Staff was super nice. Chicken was voluptuous and juicy with crunchy yummy skin and cinnamon/maple BBQ sauce. Waffle fries were also great. 10/10 would munch again. Slightly overpriced in comparison to other more traditional krn fried chicken places but worth trying. :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to their soft opening on their first day. We ordered:

Korean fried chicken with fries - amazingly juicy fried chicken with a crisp light batter, and delicious sauce (sweet with a bit of a kick). The fries could use a bit more salt.

Rice balls with taro chips - the rice balls with kimchi was nice and crispy with fluffy rice inside. It's pretty much like an Italian arancini balls. The taro chips were a bit over fried.

Pork belly roti taco - the pork belly was nicely charred, and the cabbage added a nice crunch.

Half corn - the charred cheese with the carrots and zucchini on the top was good, but I wished the corn was charred throughout as well. The corn felt like it was boiled then charred on a top before serving. Again, it could use a bit more salt :)

Otherwise we will definitely be back to try their Galbi, and more Korean fried chicken!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful! If you like Korean food and fried chicken this is a must! The flavours and textures are on point! I will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Came here by myself to try out their infamous kimchi fries. While I was waiting for them to make it (which took around 10-15 minutes), I saw the person in the kitchen at the back using a blow torch to fire the cheese on the top so that it would melt. I thought that was pretty cool. I am used to eating kimchi fries at other places but the one here was a whole another experience. Here, they use I believe cheddar, I had mozzarella at other places so this was a surprise. These fries were packed with flavor and you can taste ever ingredient they added into it. Kimchi was fresh, fries were crispy, cheese was cheesy. The portion was enough to fill me up (I approve!). It came with extra housemade spicy mayo on the side as well which was a bonus."}
{"text":"KABOOM Chicken is an Asian fusion style restaurant that offers taste explosions in a number of dine-in and takeout options that really hit the spot when you're hungry. With a menu that is neither boring nor pricy, you'll definitely be coming back once you've had a sample of the fried chicken snacks and other goodies sold here.

Must-try items:

2 piece Korean Fried Chicken w/ upgrade to Kimcheesy Fries
Chicken Sandwich
Ramen Burger
Kimcheesy Fries
Bubble Waffles
Popcorn Chicken

The atmosphere is very relaxed and welcoming here. It's a hiphop oriented diner with comfortable seating for at least a couple of groups at any given time. Staff are extremely polite and helpful and will walk you through ordering something to your liking. As for the food, it's absolutely delicious and worth every penny. 

Broadview & Queen needed a chicken joint like this to contrast the limited selection of spots to get grub in the neighbourhood, and KABOOM does not disappoint. I've been back many times since my first visit. Judging by the consistent flow of patrons and curious onlookers that can be seen here on a daily basis, they aren't going anywhere for the foreseeable future. Try everything on the menu including the rice balls, you really can't lose."}
{"text":"3.5 Star

I have been wanting to try KABOOM Chicken for the longest time. I do like the option of ordering by the piece at $3.25 each, as fried chicken is one of my guilty pleasure.

I love how the chicken was made when ordered. Nothing beat chicken right off the fryer! Crispy skin and juicy meat! Some reviewers were complaining about too much sauce, but I kind of wish for more. The sauce itself was more on the sweet side vs spicy but it would have taste perfect for most.

I can tell management really care about the customers as there are napkins/wetnaps, water station and all the things that you need to eat your chicken!

I do wish the chicken piece is a little bigger, especially at $3.25 each. I guess it is a good thing I am wishing for more."}
{"text":"Okay second time around. This time I had the fried chicken and bubble waffle. 2 chicken legs on the side with waffles in ball shapes and they're so tasty it's like they have the syrup inside about a waffle with the same tasty sauce that was on the wings I had last time. Thumbs up for consistency"}
{"text":"That fried chicken is actually a 4.5-5 star. (the rest of the food that came with it was 3/5)  Pretty yum! And perfectly fried. Was apprehensive as it looked dry and had that fiery red sauce on top - was afraid it would be too spicy. But it was pretty good, had abit of sweet to the spice and did leave that haaahh feeling in your mouth after you finished a bite. Super crispy and crunchy and flavorful skin (one part was so crunchy it was like the chicharoon chips) and yet tender and, juicy inside. 

2.5-3/5: The slaw was pretty simple - cabbage with a wasabi vinegar like on it - kinda got used to it. Not a big fan of that - I rather the pickled turnip and carrot kinda deal to go along with the simple slaw. And the fries had some spice but honestly I did not know what to do with them after eating only 1/4 of them - that feeling you get when you feel you have to finish it because you bought it but it is just way too darn dry and if you are going to fill up on unhealthy fries they should at least taste amazing, but these didnt, so I didnt finish them. I wonder how the kimchi fries taste here though. Good to compare to others like Completo's way down east off of Queen (that was good). 

I do like the decor, minimal wood and pipes yet very bright and airy lots of room and the chalk board signs."}
{"text":"Was skeptical of this place, but the chicken tasted great!
They also put some great spices on their fries.
Pass on the coleslaw.
Would go back!"}
{"text":"**this is based off a foodora delivery** 

I got the thigh and drum on bubble egg waffle and it was very tasty. The breading on the chicken was crispy and not greasy at all. The egg waffle was not too sweet and very filling. The chilli sauce could have used a bit more spice but the hot sauce/mayo type thing on the side more than made up for it."}
