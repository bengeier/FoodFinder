{"text":"I ordered the special. It was a crispy fried half-chicken with a cassoulet of beans and kale. So fabulous and so yummy! Service good. Mohamed is the best, v attentive. Love this place!  Back two nights later and food and wine is just as great as the first time. Seated in Mohamed's area again. It is a pleasure to be here! Service is the best! Mohamed is v personable."}
{"text":"Love the nice atmosphere and decor at this restaurant, just inside the Westin hotel. My husband and I had a wonderful dinner here last night. The tuna nachos were truly awesome. I got the blue crab flatbread and my husband ordered the short rib pot pie, both entrees were very tasty. The service was above and beyond excellent. Our server was a delightful young lady named Korin. I can't say enough about how knowledgeable she was about the menu, and very personable. The restaurant manager Oatis Smith stopped by our table introduced himself, and ask if everything was to our satisfaction. I love when a  restaurant cares about their customers. Sometimes this is all to rare! All in all, a wonderful dining  and experience!"}
{"text":"JP restaurant is inside the Westin on the first floor. Great chefs, Brianna and Jordan. Salmon tonight, deviled eggs at happy hour today, scallops last night. All excellent. Scallops and eggs best I've had anywhere, salmon one of the best. Great and very attentive wait staff. Wait staff and chefs very accomodating of my food allergies. This restaurant is a real asset to the Westin. I even enjoyed their upbeat music in the restaurant. Decor well done as well. Portions slightly small but price is a good value. If I'm back in Charlotte, this place is a come back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Food was not good and the tropical sangria was terrible and overpriced. Would not eat here again"}
{"text":"I don't write bad reviews but I have to say the last few times I have been to JP Charlotte, I have had a few issues. For starters the food is delicious but the past couple times the food has taken a very long time to be made. I understand quality takes time but it was 45 minutes for the bucatini pasta. Secondly my last visit I sat at the bar and had the worst service. The bartender (I think her name was Caleigh) seemed frustrated to answer questions and was very short and rude when she actually did answer questions. I had asked how long it would be until my pasta was out and she said didn't know. When I paid my bill she did not say thank you or anything, just set down my change and walked away. I usually have great service when sitting at an actual tables so I was shocked to receive such poor service."}
{"text":"It was convenient so it was the obvious choice. It was above average food and service for a hotel breakfast. The hostess went above and beyond and waited on us at certain times.  I got a biscuit Benedict and it was good. It was a departure from the conventional but still good. Outside of the biscuit itself everything else was expected for an eggs Benedict.  If you're in the Westin it's a freeroll."}
{"text":"If I wrote this review last year after my Ladies gift exchange meet up and after my family started a Christmas Brunch tradition I would've gave this place 5 stars. However after our 3 visit (this year Christmas Brunch) I had to take away 2 stars for my perspective. I'm Vegan and the Christmas Brunch is extremely large with a lot of options and stations. I don't expect much in the South as far as Vegan options on menus or let alone a buffet. However my family really wanted to do this Brunch since we agreed that the years we stay in town it will be our tradition. Well I called beforehand and inquired about Vegan options and was told there were about 3-4. Keep in mind the regular food options are 30-40. I asked about not paying the $60 Adult rate for myself as I wouldn't be able to eat like those who eat meat and animal products. I stated that I'm willing to pay the child price of $29 to munch on 3-4 items out of 30-40. I was told the manager on site Christmas would be able to do that for me.  So we arrive for our reservation and the manager came over to show me the \"Vegan\" options which were actually Vegetarian only 1-2 were Vegan so I couldn't eat but 1-2 items instead of 3-4 and guess what?? I was charged $60 since I'm an adult not keeping in mind there wasn't food for me to eat.  I paid as its Christmas but I won't be returning with my family we will find another Brunch and make that tradition as this was ridiculous for me 2017."}
{"text":"We had a party of 9 and were seated promptly.  The décor is upscale and the food is good but not special.  The problem was the service, I was not impressed.  I had difficulty understanding the waiter and he was mostly inattentive.  After reading the Yelp reviews, I was expecting more. Charlotte has many great restaurants in the uptown area so I would not return to the Westin."}
{"text":"Excellent service! The shrimp and grits were awesome!!! The best I ever had!!! The buffet breakfast was delicious. There was a wonderful selection, a omelet station that made it anyway you wanted, seasonal fresh fruit, and much more."}
{"text":"So, the food is really good.  A well-edited and inventive take on local specialties.  The problem is, the place seems to be under the control of an evil computer system.  I am Not Kidding.  Due to some glitch we could not be seated even tho the place was about half empty.  And the orders are slow to arrive and appear in a random way.  So, westin, please hear this, your system is hurting your sales and I bet this isn't the first time you've been told that.  Please bring it up to the quality of the food!"}
{"text":"I've grown to really enjoy this restaurant after traveling to the hotel for over a year.  It's a nice spot to have a quiet meal with colleagues or alone while staying at the hotel with rotating specials and the ability to get a scoop of ice cream as a regular indulgence. Natasha is very friendly and professional whether she's the hostess or a waitress (or occasionally at the coffee station in the morning)."}
{"text":"My family and I had the Mother's Day brunch today. I will just go through the most important aspects one by one.   We arrived early about thirty minutes early and we were seated right away. Which was awesome we choose to sit in the patio outside.  Initially our waiter told us about each different buffet station. The food was amazing. There's was a kids buffet with typical food me kids like pizza, fries, fruit, chicken tenders. There was a carving station with beef, pork, and fish on it. A seafood buffet with shrimp, salmon, crab claws and a variety of other items. Traditional breakfast bar with Bacon, sausage, eggs, waffles, (the chicken and waffles was my favorite). There was also an omelet station where a chef was to prepare your omelet like you wanted, and a crepe station (another favorite) there was a choice between a seafood crepe and a fruit crepe. I had the fruit crepes the fruit was fresh the crepe was cooked just enough it was moist and very tastey. Better than a place that specializes in crepes across town.   On to the price. The price for an adult was $54 and children were $24. Children under 5 were free. This sounds expensive but for all the options it was well worth it I promise I'm cheap.  So the only reason I gave a three stars instead of five the absolute only reason was the server.  We saw him one to give us drinks. The entire rest of the time he would walk by our table and not say anything at all. Didn't offer drink refills our cups were empty. I finally flagged down a manager to ask for more drinks. He finally walked to our table and explained he was busy and Laughed. FYI if I'm spending $100 plus on brunch I don't want to hear how busy you are. I want good Service. I didn't complain to a manager because people think people who complain are trying to get feee food. The bill wasn't the issue the service was.   Overall I would go back because the food is some of the best I've had in the city. BUT and this is a big BUT if I saw that server working I would make sure he was not my server."}
{"text":"Made reservations for their NYE dinner. I called that afternoon on our way to the hotel. The gentleman on the other line was friendly and informed us that they only had two reservations available for that evening: 7pm and 9pm. I decided on the 7pm.   We arrived promptly at 7pm for dinner. The hostess greeted us and seated us immediately. The place was not busy at this time. The restaurant is open, modern, and sophisticated. They offer outside seating by the fire pit as well. I wanted to take a peek, but was too cold for me to go outside. Most tables and counters inside have beautiful marble tops. They offered an optional prix fixe NYE menu, but we decided against it.  My SO noticed the Falcons vs. Panthers game playing on the big screen by the bar and asked me if I would be okay with moving to the bar. I didn't see an issue with it. We informed the hostess of our change.  There was only one bartender working throughout our dinner. More and more people approached and sat by the bar as the night progressed. He was friendly, pleasant, and tried his best to keep up with all the customers. There was a bit of a wait time for our drinks and food, but we weren't in a rush so it did not bother us.   We started with drinks: Dewars and water for the SO and rum cobbler for me. The rum cobbler was strong yet sweet. For dinner, we tried the following: Tuna Poke Nachos - $16 Blackened Sea Scallops with NC grits - $24 Atlantic Salmon with Brussel Sprouts - $22 Key Lime Creme Brûlée - $7  Cinnamon Apple Fritters with Vanilla Ice Cream - $7  Everything was delicious!!! From the Tuna Poke Nachos to the Apple Fritters - the chefs know what they are doing. The flavors were on point and presentation was appealing. I enjoyed the Tuna Poke Nachos, Sea Scallops, and Apple Fritters the most. We gobbled up the tuna nachos within minutes. It came with multiple sauces that all worked perfectly together. I wanted more. My entree came with four big sea scallops. The grits were creamy, cheesy and a bit salty, but not overwhelming. My SO's salmon was juicy and the vinaigrette it came with added the right amount of tart. The fritters were like warm donut holes. Can't go wrong with pairing it with ice cream! The key lime creme brûlée was exactly that. The crumbled graham cracker and toasted strawberry marshmallow on top added a nice touch and flavor.  Prices are pretty reasonable for portions. We were both full after our entrees and were not able to finish both desserts. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Come here often for good breakfast with no wait time on the weekends. They offer a full buffet with an omelette station with juice/coffee included for $23. It's good deal considering the pancakes alone are $15, however I stay away from the buffet due to the temptation to overeat.  The coffee is great and service is short and sweet but effective.   Cons: potatoes tend to be undercooked and not crispy!!! They don't validate parking."}
{"text":"We tried JP's for Valentine's Day. They did not disappoint at all!! Our service was EXCELLENT and our food was AMAZING! They weren't kidding when they said it was an experience. Our server, Mark E, did an exceptional job describing the menu items and suggesting the perfect cocktail pairings for us. He also was very attentive but not hovering over us. Excellent job! Thank you. I honestly feel when you have excellent service it only adds to your dining experience. He truly enhanced the DELICIOUS food we received. Oh and we also received complimentary champagne to toast our romantic dinner which was a plus!  The food....I honestly cannot even find the words to describe how impeccable the food was. It truly was an outstanding experience that I highly recommend and I cannot wait to return to this beautiful restaurant. Hopefully you can see what I'm talking about from my pics and the menu descriptions. The ambience was also perfect!  Thank you JP Charlotte for an amazing valentines dinner that I won't soon forget!"}
{"text":"The Bartender Saniyyah was amazingly pleasant, warm, and downright awesome.   The crafted cocktails are superb!!' My fave is the Ruby Basil-"}
{"text":"JP Charlotte located in the Westin hotel provides a nice dining experience very without the trouble of leaving the hotel. Food is good, service is average, and prices are mid to high. Expect to pay 25 for breakfast, 30 for lunch, and 35-40 for dinner."}
{"text":"The buffet breakfast was very good except for the scrambled eggs that had been setting out too long. They corrected it by the second trip to the line. Service was great and the ambiance was relaxed. However, as with most hotel restaurants, it was quite expensive. This was offset in our case by eating late so we could skip lunch. Along with the convenience of being right downstairs from the rooms, it was a good value."}
{"text":"My sister, her son, and I stayed at the Westin Charlotte during Mother's Day weekend.   The Luggage Attendant, Socrates was so kind and careful in managing our luggage as we prepared to go to our rooms - what a respectful and courteous gentleman.  We dined at the JP Charlotte Restaurant for a fantastic experience with Hak.    I was impressed by all of the Staff within the hotel, even when we booked our reservations late the staff was willing to arrange for us to have adjoining rooms. The Maids made sure our rooms were immaculate on a daily basis and the Receptionist was friendly and extremely help.    The overall high standard and the exceptional service from the Staff was outstanding! We have decided to return every Mother's Day and for anytime we want to relax and get away from our busy lives. At our next visit, we will invite other family members and friends to join us.  A special than you to LAZ Parking as well!  Again, thank you Martha, Danielle, Renita, Suella, Tramayne K., and Brittiney W.  Sincerely,  Maxi B"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant in the Westin hotel. It has a sophisticated sheek look. It was very clean and the staff were pleasant as well as attentive. It wasn't too crowded. The setting was comfortable. I came for the tapas week. On a Friday afternoon they typically have a band, but they had a whiskey sampling instead. The whiskey  was a pleasant surprise. We were educated on the style brand and process and allowed three different shots. The Beloach ( I may have spelled this wrong)  California wine was lovely. It was recommended by our server. Great recommendation. As the evening progressed they came over and lit a fire on our table. Muhammad really tried to make sure the fire was nice. He did a great job. We ordered the pork belly tacos and scallop appetizers. I am a big foodie and loved both dishes. The tacos were flavorful and delicious. The scallop was well presented and melted in your mouth like butter. It was a nice element for our evening. The staff went above and beyond my expectation. It was my friends birthday and they presented her with a delectable chocolate cake that was huge. I will definitely return and highly recommend."}
{"text":"After a late afternoon flight into Charlotte we wanted a quick place to eat some good food.  Decided to try out JP in our hotel.  Service was extremely poor.  The waiter kept going to other tables.  After finally getting some water and placing our order we proceeded to wait over an hour for salmon and a cheeseburger.  Tables around us were being served before us yet arrived after us.  The manager apologized to us and an excuse was made that our food took so long because the restaurant also takes care of room service.  When our food finally arrived the cheeseburger meal was incorrect and the salmon meal had raw Brussel sprouts.  We were glad to get out of there and did not revisit the restaurant while in Charlotte.  There are so many other choices in this great city!"}
{"text":"This is the restaurant inside the Westin in downtown charlotte.  I came here for lunch on a Saturday while staying at the hotel for my wedding weekend.  Woooo, we are married!  So down to the details.  We were seated quickly as it was early afternoon.  The waiter was very attentive and easy to get along with.  We ordered and I got a turkey club and fries.  The sandwich was huge!  Super thick slices of tender turkey piled high.  Fresh avocado, bacon and fresh tomatoes rounded out the sandwich, add a nice toasty wheat bread and you have a club that I want to join.  Man, that was a bad joke!  Haha So anyway, they could earn five stars by turning their prices down a little, but that is what you get in downtown I suppose, one of my groomsmen paid anyway!   I would go back here just to get that awesome club again, check the pic!"}
{"text":"If it's raining out or you got back to the hotel after dinner time, JP's is open by the lobby till 10PM.  Every dish fell short but wasn't terrible.  *Tuna Poke Nachos $16 - 6 chips with hoisin marinated tuna topped with cabbage and avocado crema. SO WEIRD. *Calamari - peanuts, honey glaze, and clumpy. The pieces of calamari had melted all into one big ball. *Heirloom tomato, avocado, mozzerella, bread, under gazpacho - awful dish that came with 3 hunks of tomato, 6 halves of mini mozzerella balls, and 6 small chunks of avocado served with a stale piece of bread *Roasted duck ($24) - served with cherry jus and vegetable spatzle left me craving Thanksgiving instead *Key lime creme brulee - roasted strawberry marshmallow, graham cracker crumbs, burnt sugar over key lime creme brulee.  They didn't have panna cotta so I settled for the creme brulee and honestly, this was the most noteworthy dish for the interesting flavors. Friendly service. Glad the 1st game of the NBA finals was on to take away from the quality of the food. Service was great, water refills, and being told our food would be out shortly several times. The arm chairs smelled like baby powder though."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant inside the Westin. We had a large work group dining here this evening, and they'd prepared a fixed menu for us.   We sat outdoors and the conversation was sparkling, aided no doubt by the excellent wine and cocktails being served.  The food courses included quinoa with octopus, fresh ahi in tomato purée, beef over gnocchi, and a couple of other dishes that did not make it to my side of the table. It was all delicious!   Dessert came in two rounds - a bowl of assorted macarons, which I enjoyed more than my fair share of - and then a humongous dessert platter that I declined to sample out of guilt. They also had cake pops and a cheesecake platter on the OTHER table (there were over 20 of us).   Would recommend for a large group as they served us without any noticeable hiccups, and everyone had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"I strayed away from my hotel for dinner before a meeting to be held here at the Westin in Charlotte.  I must say I hope the food is good because the service is deplorable -- among the worst I've ever experienced anywhere. This rating is based on awful service and not food quality."}
{"text":"Due to an odd string of events, the fella and I ended up here for brunch before the Panthers game this Saturday. Especially compared to other hotel restaurants, I thought JP Charlotte was a little lackluster.  I ordered an omelet and potatoes, and they were pretty basic but two times what basic eggs, potatoes, and cheese should cost. The mimosa I had was pretty much just orange juice (fresh squeezed orange juice nonetheless, but I want to taste the bubbly). The fella also had an okay experience with their breakfast sandwich. The advertised \"Texas toast\" was just your average sandwich bread toast.  Overall, nothing bad but nothing worth coming for here! The bar next door was popping prior to the game, though. I'd go there on another Sunday."}
{"text":"Fun Menu! Our food was great, our service wasn't. I'm not sure we would have ever been waited on if what looked to be the manager had not came and took our order. It wasn't that busy and they appeared to have plenty of help. No one ever refreshed our drinks. And then when we left they gave us a parking validation code that didn't work. It's really too bad because the food was really good."}
{"text":"My family and I went here Mother's day brunch, and we had am amazing experience. Everything from the food to the service was excellent. My server was so caring & treated my family as if it were her own, management made it very obvious that the customer's experience was a top priority. Prime rib was the best that I've had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"The service here is very spotty. Everyone seems to be trying, but things move far too slowly for a venue that caters to business travelers and conferences. It would seem to me that the trouble is in the back of the house."}
