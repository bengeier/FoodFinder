{"text":"This little cafe has a nice outdoor seating area, and is far enough from the stages on the all-pedestrian section of Fremont to be fairly quiet (noise wise). Inside, they play nice music (Euro-pop?), not too loud. The food is excellent! It's almost all fresh-made from fresh (not frozen) food bought daily, according to the assistant manager, Josh. I would call this place fast-casual. You order at the counter, but they bring your food out to you on disposable dishes. The kabobs I ordered were delicious and the hummus was also! The pitas were the best I've ever tasted in a reasonably priced restaurant. Decor was decent, and the service was very good for a cafe of this type. I will definitely be back, and will recommend Cous Cous to anyone I know who likes Greek food and will be in downtown LV."}
{"text":"Almost inexpressibly dreadful. The lentil soup looked like dishwater with some lentils dumped in it. The falafel pita pocket was around 95 percent damp, frigid, flavorless salad with a couple of ancient falafels hiding at the bottom. The fat young woman who took our order and later delivered our meals couldn't have been more charmless on a bet. Avoid!"}
{"text":"The men's bathroom code 1717.   The women's bathroom code is 6086.   Don't get the spanakopita.   It smells good.   Don't be fooled."}
{"text":"The only thing worse than the cold, stale gyro I ordered, was the even colder uninterested service recieved. The taziki was congealed. The meat was crusted and cold.  I get that sometimes food prep is less than desirable in a tourist spot like this, but to get horrible food AND have the staff not look you in the eye and show any form of common courtesy, is unacceptable.  I wish we had walked just a little bit further down Freemont St., to one of the many \"off the Freemont Experience\" places for good food and friendly service.   A mistake that will not be repeated.  And don't even get me started on how much my wife despises this place. Her experience was even worse."}
{"text":"We came all the way over here just for this place which states online and on the door itself that they are open till midnight but were totally closed at 11pm. We even knocked on the glass door to get the cashiers attention but he wouldn't even acknowledge us. How rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"Terrible service.... woman taking orders at the counter totally bypassed me and my husband and told customers that had just waked in that she would be right with hem and walked away.  When she got back to register I said excuse me we were here prior to the people that were there and she began to tell me that she only serviced people by the register. Even though I told her I was there before and that I only sat because I had a broken toe.  I told her she was being rude because she started taking someone else's order.  She even went as far as telling me she was the owner when I told her I would report her.  She was rude, unprofessional and disrespectful."}
{"text":"The worst experience I ever had a restaurant in my life. I went in stood look at the menu for about 5 mins figured out what I wanted then went to the counter to order my food but I had to use the restroom. I ask the lady at the counter may I have the code so I could use the restroom, she was so rude to me. She literally said no it's for customers only, which I understand that part but It's the way she said it to me and she also didn't even ask me whether I planned on dining with them or not. I politely let her know I've been standing in your establishment for 5 mins looking at the menu &d it wasn't for my health. Finally get the code use the restroom and order the chicken Greek salad, which was the worst Greek salad I ever had in my life. First thing is they give u 4 small pieces of chicken for 3.50 extra and they were dry, there was barely any cheese, barely any tomatoes but a ton of olives and onions on the salad. U could tell the person that was making it didn't really care about the food. Tried to sit down in the restaurant but all the tables were dirty &d I didnt really want to bother the lady at the counter again so I just left and eat the salad somewhere else."}
{"text":"Service is not that great , nor was the cleanliness of this facilities . But its a busy section in town , lots of traffic , in the Fremont District . We came in here 2 weeks ago , 4 of us ordered appetizers and Kabobs with rice. Food was ok but too much salad  in our Sandwiches , its a sign that they are cheep . I don't think they use the right Mediterranean spicing in the food  , its a place that will do well if the improve on the above items I just noted ."}
{"text":"I have very high standards with my gyros and I am a tzatziki lover and this place definetly met them, also freshest pita EVER! Cozy quaint cafe feel, there WILL be a next time."}
{"text":"Run from this place!!! They have a poster advertising poutine in the window. Definitely not poutine! Not sure what kind of cheese but it was not cheese curd. The  brown gravy was not correct for poutine. Probably from a can. The chicken shawarma was chopped chicken,. If you're not going to serve what you advertise don't serve at all."}
