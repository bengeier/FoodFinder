{"text":"Ate here tonight.  I had the pork shashlik sandwich and it was very good.  In comparison to Monfort I thought the Agabi one was better.  They brought out two bottles for the sauces.  One thing to pay attention for, the \"Salad\" option is like an app option, it isn't a side.  When I was asked if I wanted a salad I was thinking it was a side salad but it ended up being a large bowl of salad and cost like $7.95 which was almost the price of the sandwich.  I would skip the salad next time but the sandwich was great."}
{"text":"We had the most amazing grilled octopus! If you haven't tried it yet you need to go to Agabi NOW!  The combination of the smokey char exterior and the melt in your mouth tender meat is just heavenly"}
{"text":"Delicious every time I go, and worth a drive from Etobicoke. Their hummus is very tasty, and I would also recommend the shashlik and the mixed grill. Huge portions, so go hungry.   Last time I was there the entrees took a while to come out and they brought out free dessert for us for the inconvenience. Great service."}
{"text":"Food 5 star, best shawarma in Oakville hands down (sorry Monforts).  However you do feel like you are still in high school when you order a diet coke and you get served it in a can....and a straw.  This place has been around from what I can remember for 10 years or more between its first location on Lakeshore and now on Kerr street,  they should really have a fountain machine to serve carbonated drinks and serve in a nice glass with ice and a lime, then top up with refills?  Suffice to say great food for lunch or a quick dinner before a night out.....still can't get past the canned soda part...what are they thinking?"}
{"text":"I began eating at Agabi while it was still located at Lakeshore near Kerr St. Let me tell you..... It is one of the best places I have ever been to. Chicken shawarma pita with salad and soup. Outstanding lunch.... Pineapple chicken for dinner..... Can't be topped. Every single person who I have brought to Agabi left full and happy. And passing on the positive word of mouth to friends and family.   One of the best."}
{"text":"Agabis has the best shawarma I have ever tried. I often drive a very long distance to just have one shawarma."}
{"text":"When I'm around, Agabi is a great place to grab a bite! I've only had the Chicken Shawarma, but you get a lot and it's very delicious! Fast and friendly service makes a great break for a meal at Agabi!"}
{"text":"This place is on the ball.  I've had a few dishes on the menu and have never been disappointed (lamb and octopus)..... but the real star is the 135lbs of marinated chicken thighs on the rotisserie for the Shwarma..... best lunch in town.   Reasonably priced,  impeccably seasoned and cooked.    Don't cheap out. .... be sure to treat yourself to a home made order of baklava!"}
{"text":"We had a delicious lunch at Agabi. The fattoush is fantastic, the chicken was perfect. Really tasty. Beer menu leaves a lot to be desired, decor is a bit dated. Great for lunch or not so fancy dinner night out. I feel like if I lived closer this would be the perfect take out for movie night at home. Really tasty, favourite in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Been going there for well over 15 years. Assam is an amazing chef and puts in long hours to make sure his food it good.   We always get the mixed grill, wild mushroom soup and the crème brule. We have almost never had a disappointing meal there. (Only once when his wife had gone into labour and his newer sous chef was cooking.)  Sometimes the new, part time, student staff can be a little rough around the edges. However, the full timers are very good in terms of service.   The price is great for the quality of food. We have grown up on his food, you know a restaurant is good when a family is willing to travel from Toronto just to eat there."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night as a group of 8. Arrived around 530 to beat the rush and that really paid off because it filled up around 6. They have good business in the dining room and a healthy take out line as well. We ordered the escargot, lamb shashlik, home fries, moussaka, chicken shawarma, deep fried calamari, falafel, soup, saganaki and some pitas. Almost everything came with a Greek salad. Food was great as always but service was a bit slow. They did have a lot of people working but they could have used maybe 1 more. Bathroom was clean. Free ample parking in the adjacent parking lot. The waitress was experienced but tried to upsell constantly. Very enjoyable, will be back."}
{"text":"Always great food with the best selection of middle-eastern spices. I would strongly suggest this place to anyone.   The only issue is just tag time for preparing the food but patience is well paid off by the quality and taste :-)"}
{"text":"The food was ok..but we waited 10 mins for the waitress to get our appetizer order which came about 20 mins later. As soon as we got the appetizer we placed the dinner order and that came 30 mins later..when we walked in it wasn't busy, it did get busy when we left. Maybe they had an off day, but definitely wasn't a good dinner for me."}
{"text":"Good Greek style food, friendly and reasonably fast service. We went there on boxing day when we intended to go to a different restaurant, but it was closed between Xmas and NewYear for reservations. Agabi nearby and open and we were hungry, having been there once we will go again on purpose"}
{"text":"Homemade fresh everyday. It's all about personal preference but this is one both me and my wife love!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding. Take out or sitting in, the menu items are fantastic and so tasty. So glad to have discovered this place. I'm a regular when I'm in town. The chicken shawarma is dynamite!"}
{"text":"Friends and I frequent Agabi for lunch. I absolutely love their chicken shawarma pita. I love it so much that it's actually the only thing I have ever gotten there. It's a healthy serving, sure to not leave you hungry. I always get it with a side Greek salad. I love the salad dressing!   I love that they put the bottles of sauce and hot sauce on the table for those of us that like to dip our chicken pita in it.   The wait staff are attentive and the prices are good. The quality of food is outstanding."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Agabi for over 15 years now and they have been consistent all this time. Their grilled calamari and shawarma is the best ...hands down. The chicken shawarma is simple with just meat, lettuce, garlic sauce and hot sauce but don't let that fool you. It is absolutely flavourful and the garlic sauce is again the best. The other great thing about Agabi is the menu has lots of Mediteranean and middle Eastern options. How can I forget to mention the grilled eggplant!!"}
{"text":"Ordered hummus to start, grilled octopus and Greek salad as well as chicken souvlaki main.   Service is friendly and prompt but the place needs air conditioning.  It is cooler outside than in here on a late summer Saturday night!!  Hummus was tasty with a drizzle of olive oil and some olives and a nice thin chewy pita bread.  Chicken souvlaki was a generous portion of rice and salad and a long skewer of moist grilled chicken.  Grilled octopus was a generous portion of grilled octopus with a tomato caper salsa.  Greek salad was a nice portion of crispy lettuce, onions, tomato and feta.  Definitely a place worth making a regular stop!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Agabi . I send many of my customers when they ask for a good restaurant. Its not a chain which is nice , free parking , nice staff, very clean. The price was excellent for Oakville.  If you want to try something new give them a try. Robert"}
{"text":"I loved their chicken shawarma first time I ate, but eventually I found that it was inconsistent. Too pricy. Their baba ganoush was delicious."}
{"text":"Omg i love their falafel!! I used to go here when they were on lakeshore road and their food hasn't changed at all. Amazing price for great food!!"}
{"text":"The shawarma in a pita is the best in town, it's big, tastey and reasonably priced. The sauces are amazing and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"I went to Agabi on June 17, 2017 for dinner with a few friends.  I thought well of the restaurant.   My friends like what they ordered, which was Chicken shawarma.  The waitress was attentive and friendly.   The Taramisu was great.  What ruined the dinner was the grilled Octopus appetizer.   It was mushy instead of fresh and juicy tasting.  I am used to buying Octopus and cooking it.  The Octopus I got tasted like it was frozen for long time, and boiled in water too long.  Whatever they did to cook this Octopus made it the worst Octopus I ever had.   It was mushy and not fresh tasting.    Other than that I have a positive view of the restaurant and I plan to revisit and give it another chance.  But the Octopus, please be forewarned.   If you have different opinion on the Octopus appetizer, pleas share.  At $18 with tax, it was the most disappointing food I ate in 2017 so far.  BB j L"}
{"text":"We have been regulars at Agabi for almost 5 years and the food has never disappointed us. This is some of the freshest, most authentic Mediterranean cuisine I have had. You can see Mr Agabi and his son cook in the open kitchen, all fresh ingredients and nothing made ahead (well except for the chicken for the shawarma of course which I highly recommend). The appetizers are excellent, and the seafood always outstanding. Service has been up and down over the years but lately seems to be on top of things. If you are in Oakville, this is one of the places to eat at, absolutely! We also eat at Montfort and although they can easily earn 4*, the food is not as elegant and sophisticated as what Mr Agabi prepares."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this place! It is a spacious restaurant with lovely smells and great food! I am a fan of mediterranean and middle eastern food, and this place hits the spot. I have eaten their falafel bowl, grilled squid dish, and baklava. And my parents and siblings have tried other dishes with approval. It is quick service and fresh food, making it the best around town, in my opinion. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I get takeout from here, it's always ready when I pick it up, great chicken shawarma, sauces are pretty good you should get some extras to take home because you might crave them later."}
{"text":"I visited Agabi for lunch recently. Firstly, while the outside of the building isn't the most sightly, the interior decorations are actually quite nice and add to the atmosphere of the restaurant. The service in the restaurant was timely and friendly, and the servers were attentive to all needs including a birthday dessert for a friend.  Value-wise Agabi may seem expensive for their platters however you get a lot of food on the platter.  Concerning the food itself, I ordered a chicken shawarma platter. This came with salad, a side dish, and the chicken itself.  The salad was good, I choose the garden over the greek and all the ingredients seemed fresh and the dressing was good.  For my side I went with the fries. I would say they were average - above average, nothing to set them apart from the competition.  The chicken itself though was delicious.  It came with sauce on top and more was available on the table.  Additionally, you can ask for as much pita bread as you like allowing you to make your own mini pitas.  Overall, I would recommend Agabi, and would go back if given the opportunity."}
{"text":"Literally the best chicken shawarma in all of oakville, hands down. I've spent the last few weeks trying lots of different \"shawarma on the rocks\" dishes and Agabi is by far the best!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite Mediterranean spots.  Bonus points because it's non-halal, and offers pork and seafood options.  Wonderfully spiced chicken, a mix of white and dark meat both.    Pitas are freshly toasted under the salamander before stuffing, and are always warm and toasty.  AMAZING calamari, one of my favorites of any restaurant.  They offer both grilled and fried varieties, and both are absolutely homemade and delicious.  It is an absolute MUST order any time we are there.  And I absolutely love their greek salad.  I wish I knew what that dressing they used is, because I could drink it.  My only gripe is that the salad is always a small portion, it's so good I wish it was twice the size.  Highly recommended by both me and the wife, we love it here, and it's inevitably our choice every single time we venture to Oakville.  Pricey, though"}
{"text":"I don't know what the heck happened to this place, We have ordered from here  5 times in the last few months. The quality of food has really gone down! All 5 times the chicken was quite fatty and not tasty at all. Last night was the final time eating here, it was again fatty and bland also my wife and son got very upset stomachs after the meal. What a shame as we have been coming here for years and enjoying great food."}
{"text":"Reliable and tasty, the liver was great! It is not the best, but very good and so far the best in Oakville for kebabs and such."}
{"text":"We always love the food here ...the mixed platter is great for my wife and I to share. Service is good ... Always accommodating . Great for families ."}
{"text":"Suprsingly nice interior! I stopped in for lunch, a very friendly cheif peered out of his kitchen and warmly asked what he could make for me. I ordered a chickeb shwarma. The chicken were large well seasoned chunks of extremely tender meat. It came in a cyrious pocket sized pita rather then a typical cylinder shape and looked rather small at first. After digging in i relized the entire pitta is filled with chicken rather then fillers like lettuce. The menu looks fantastic and i plan on takking the girl back here for dinner to try some seafood."}
{"text":"Great for late night food, they are open until 11pm even on weekdays. They were so kind to accept us for dinner for four on a Friday night at 10:50, right before their closing time. We tried the chicken shawarma with rice, it was not bad. The server was super nice and the place seemed cozy. They have lots of room for large groups. They accept credit cards. They offer take out."}
{"text":"I honestly can't think of anything else that would've made my dinner any better!  Sure, interior is somewhat dated, but who cares when service + food are AMAZING.  We had the Wild Octopus (grilled - can be entrée), BBQ Eggplant Drip (came with pitas), Mixed Grill (leftovers even with 2ppl eating it!), waiter sold us on the creme brulée, & I brought home a piece of tiramisu for a bday party the next day.  With the exception of the Eggplant Dip, everything else was a standout!  Eggplant Dip was ok.  Wild Octopus was so tender, never really had octopus that tasted like that - not even in Portugal!  Everything on the Mixed Grill, even the onions & mushrooms, were seasoned so well and not overcooked, very tender.  Perfect amount of cheese/dressing on the Greek Salad, which came with the Mixed Grill.  Dressing tasted homemade, with a distinctive taste of oregano.  Creme Brulée - Even though we were full, the waiter convinced us to get the creme brulée.  (Tbh, not much convincing was needed.)  He gave us a rare treat by flambée the dessert, table-side and did an absolutely gorgeous job!  Tiramisu - Although it didn't look good, as it was put into a largish styro container, was absolutely amazing, even the next day.  Quite authentic!  Can't say enough about this place.  Everything is made in-house with the exception of the hot sauce, which is delish!  Garlic sauce was also very good.  Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"This place just recently moved locations.  I went to the old location down the street, so this review is based on that.  Agabi is similar to Montfort's, but not as good.  I enjoy mediterranean food, and I was not disspointed here.  Their food was delicious, but a bit expensive.  Food quality is amazing as always.  Service is friendly and prompt.  The location is also not bad, moving from lakeshore was a step in the right direction.  But Montort's has a leg up on Agabi for its interior feel.  Agabi has a more casual feel, while Montforts is more high-end.    I would recommend this place.  I would also recommend Montfort's, which is better in my opinion.  Derek"}
{"text":"This pleased my stomach. I like the atmosphere in this place and their lamb shawarma gave me a positive note about this place. I need to go back there!"}
