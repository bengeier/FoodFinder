{"text":"This is the perfect Mexican lunch spot.  Right in downtown, super fast service, excellent food, and very reasonable.  I had a chicken burrito, large size, with guacamole, sour cream, everything loaded!  The side of chips were offered for free, and I had a fountain drink.  Total was under $9, and this sucker was a monster!  The guacamole was so fresh, and they put just the right amount of everything so you can taste every ingredient in there - no one taste was overpowering.  I used to go to Chipotle's, but I doubt I will ever go there again seeing as Madonna's is just a block or so away, much better, and cheaper."}
{"text":"This little Mexican place is tucked away on 4th between Smithfield and Wood.    Pros:   Great food.  It all tasted very fresh and well made.   Huge portions:  I got a burrito that was incredible large and weighed a ton.    Con(?):   Price:  Between my friend and I our meal wound up being around $10/person.  This was a bit more than I planned on spending for lunch, but we were downtown and the quality was commensurate with the price in my opinion.  Plus you could easily get an early dinner there, in which case the price would actually be considered cheap.  Also, I paid extra for the large burrito, which will probably be too much food for most people, so the cost of a normal meal would also be cheaper.    Cash only:  No credit cards folks so make sure to visit the ATM before you go.  $10 per person should get you a burrito/salad/whatever and a drink though.  Verdict: Frankly I was rather floored by this place and just thinking about it makes me want to go back.  I highly recommended it."}
{"text":"This is a tiny place tucked into some snazzy downtown complex. Its cheap for downtown, and the portions are generous, so I suggest getting only the smaller sizes.  I had a rice and beans burrito, and they let you take one of their hot sauces to the table. I asked for something really hot, and I actually got it. This is surprising for Pittsburgh, because I've noticed overall the town is weak on spice (even the Thai restaurants).   Anyway, the beans in the burrito were fresh and cooked perfectly, and the rice was also plump and lightly spiced. The place is tiny and clean, and I got in and out for under five dollars for lunch.     This place is really a gem--its cash only though, so bring that with you.  Good find. A lot better than some of the other places higher up on the list."}
{"text":"The new Madonna's is disappointing.  A co-worker who always gives Madonna's rave reviews picked the new location for a lunch date.  He had talked about the spices, the flavor, the service.  Well, it was one for three.  The service was friendly, even during the lunch rush.  I had the chico chicken quesadilla.  For $4.81 (with tax), it was a pretty big quesadilla.  However, it was just Monterrey jack, chicken, and a soft shell.  No spices, no onions, no peppers.  It was still decent for the price.  But I'm 99.9996% sure that the chicken was from a can.  How would I know?  Because I've cheated and used that same canned chicken in quiches when I was in a rush.  It's good canned chicken, but c'mon!  My lunchmates also complained that their burritos were bland.  I'm giving three stars because I believe Madonna's can (and will) do better.  P.S. CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite burrito in the greater Pittsburgh region. The owner always remembers my order when I show up: beans and cheese with rice, size 'chico' (though there's nothing chico about it). It's flavorful, fresh, and filling. I also recommend the taco salad, and the tacos themselves. The only item I've had that was less than thrilling was the vegetarian quesadilla... a little heavy on the cheese. But the rest is so good that an average dish has no bearing on my overall rating. Eating here is a must."}
{"text":"I was walking back and forth through downtown over a series of days and saw Madonna's. I made it a point to tell myself that I should stop in and get myself something to eat. I love Tex-Mex food and am always looking for new places to patronize.   I stopped in during lunch and ordered a steak burrito with guacamole to go. When I received my order I immediately opened it to take a bite. I was immediately underwhelmed. I saw that they had some Tapatio and added it to the full course of my burrito and took my leave of the little corner store.  The best part of the burrito was the Tapatio that I added after the fact. The issues with it were myriad. My biggest issue was the utter lack of any taste. That's right, my burrito had no flavor. How do you make a steak burrito with guacamole and pinto beans without any flavor what-so-ever in any of the components? Not far behind that question was the fact that my steak burrito had almost no steak. It was all beans and guacamole. Don't get me wrong, I like beans and guacamole when they are properly made, but I ordered a STEAK burrito and not a bean burrito seasoned with a few pieces of meat.  I might try this place again to give it another chance, but I would stay away from the steak burrito and would most likely eat vegan that day just to see if the lack of flavor was situational."}
{"text":"Not bad. Had the grande chicken burrito (6.41 with tax). Flavor wise I would probably still prefer Chipotle, but this is a nice change of pace that is a little more 'authentic.' I would say that the burrito here is much better than Mexico City's (the nearby restaurant). The guy who was working the counter (Madonna's Husband?) was very friendly and brought our food out to us from the counter. This is a pay at the front and go sit down kind of place. The interior looked better than what I was expecting and at the window there is a bar that you can sit at if you are eating alone. Not really relevant for the review but, his wife is kinda hot.  Cash only. Ack.  Food Quality/Taste = 3 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 4 Stars Price = 3 Stars Service = N/A Experience with Staff = 4 Stars Decor = 4 Stars"}
{"text":"My favorite mexican restaurant. The ingredients are so fresh everything is made to order, their home made salsa is the best.  Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Foods not grease like you get at a lot of Mexican places  Portions are very generous, you will not leave hungry. Only open for lunch and only takes cash. And it can get busy for lunch but where downtown doesn't.  All in all great food, excellent staff and a great Price. My go to Mexican pick"}
