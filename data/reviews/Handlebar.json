{"text":"Wicked place at the foot of Lower Augusta near Dundas St. Great beer selection with reasonable prices. Pretty solid events-driven line up (Music, Dj's, Arts/community events, etc.) and excellent, friendly staff. Just what a Kensington Market bar should be: a little whacky, a little sweaty on the weekend and a ton of fun."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great atmosphere, delicious cocktails, friendly staff, and always something fun happening. Also a solid pre/after dinner drink date spot"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and they've only been open less than two weeks, that's how awesome it is. Their food is constantly rotating - oysters one night, tacos another, so you never know what you're going to get, but it's all at such a ridiculously low price  I don't even know how they do it. The staff are super friendly, the beer list is great, and they have an awesome jukebox at the front."}
{"text":"Awesome staff, very chill vibe, great music. Went to dance on a Saturday night and had a great time. The patio is cozy, just like the inside."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot in  Kensington. Dim lighting, comfortable booths, cool staff. I hear they have food now which I havent yet tried. They usually have some local beers on tap , and offer king cans which I enjoy. The music and theme are varied, but you can often find soul, motown, funk DJs and some indie bands too. Staff are friendly but as the night goes on you'll probably have to fight for a spot at the bar to order. and be careful on the stairs leading down to the men's room if you've had more than a few drinks. 

I went early in the night with a lady friend and we sat in a booth. the volume was right and the lighting was good for us to catch up and have a real conversation, which was a huge plus for me. We left at around 10 when the place started filling up. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I happened to come across Handlebar for NXNE this past weekend. I never would have known this bar existed! It's a great space, with friendly servers and Kensington Market brew on tap. They also serve lettuce tacos for $4 (at least, they did the night I was there!), which is pretty great. It's a small but cozy space, perfect for an intimate NXNE show. I look forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"Overall a good place to hang out with friends. Features decent beer, nice bike-inspired interior, and pretty good live music at times.

Fun fact: They sell bike lights."}
{"text":"Went there for a friends Birthday party. Called ahead of time, to make sure they were cool with us coming and were staffed for that night. We brought in 50 people to have a good night. Could not have been more of a let down.  

Bartenders were either racists (we were mainly Asian and Indian) or too snoobish (not their traditional hipster crowd) to serve us. They would purposely pass over us, to serve their regulars. We were ready to drop some serious cash that night but instead got shitty mixed drinks in tiny glasses because they \"ran out\" of bigger glasses. And was made to feel that I should gone somewhere else. These bartenders were more interested in washing dishes and cutting lemons up rather than serve a massive crowd of people. 

If you are a hipster they will love to have you. Else you are not welcomed."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. If you go, order the ginger beer and you will not be disappointed. I love going on Wednesdays when the guys from Sonic Boom play vinyl (they also do a night of 60s music once a month). The staff has always been extremely kind and I love the ambience."}
{"text":"I love this bar for its bike-themed decor. I tried the Amsterdam Big Wheel Deluxe Amber Ale (new favourite!). Service was quick but I stopped in during a nonpeak time. The lighting in there is dimmer than most places...I feel like curling up and taking a nap in there. There is a mannequin that stands near the men's washroom and guys wave to it on their way out. Is that a thing?"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite KM bar. The atmosphere and music is always spot on, and the live music curation is even better."}
{"text":"Came here with some of the Yelpers below and left pretty drunk and what needs to be said has been said already. 

I would have stayed longer but honestly when a place is that dimly lit and I am under the influence my eyes just have trouble focusing. Its totally why I did not consider a career as batman. 

Bonus points go to the service which was friendly, pretty cool they are using an ipad as a POS. 

The back of the bar also looks cool with some classic cycles adding some awesome detail.

The toilet's can be difficult to figure out unless your Brian from Paris then you just go wherever the hell you please. 

Front patio is more of a random spare space with not one matching chair or table. 

Sit here and watch the guys opposite train in muay thai then reminisce about what a nob Van Damn looked being drunk and dancing in the movie Kickboxer."}
{"text":"J'ai atterri dans ce bar dans le cadre d'un CMYE et je dois dire qu'on a été royalement accueillis ! Dans une ambiance intimiste et retro le handlebar offre une salle tout en longueur avec petites tables en bois et vélos accrochés aux murs. L'ambiance est parfaite pour discuter tranquillement et la musique n'est pas trop forte. Le staff est adorable et leurs tournées de shot de whiskey et bourbon sont terribles! Vous pouvez aussi  commander des mini sandwichs qui sont délicieux!

I landed in that bar for a CMYE and I have to say we were welcomed like princes and princesses (not kings and queens yet). In an intimist and retro atmosphere the handlebar offers a huge space with cute tiny wooden tables and ho yeah bikes on the walls.
The atmosphere is perfect to chat with your drinkig buddies and music is not loud. Staff is perfect and their rounds of whiskey and bourbon are awesome. You can also order little sandwiches that are delicious."}
{"text":"You gotta love Handlebar! They got things right back in 2012 when they opened with a bang using Yelpers hosting an elite event that help launch them into instant classic Toronto bar status and adding a nice dose of class to a disheveled strip of Kensington Market.
There is good synergy between Round across the street and sometimes even the Boat, to provide some danceable nightlife to an otherwise tumbleweed infested strip where you might get mugged rather than have a good time.
I dropped by Handlebar recently to see a EDM live show where a friend of mine was producing, and it was good to see not much has changed from 2012.
Cozy tables along the wall facing the bar, a chill spot at the very front near the end of the long bar, and spontaneously good service from the bar keeps. This along with a perfectly sized dance floor add up to the right chemistry for longevity. Don't change a thing!
(And, if you want, run across the street and see what's happening at the neighbours :)"}
{"text":"Handlebar has become our new favourite bar in Kensington.
The drink list is awesome with lots of fun local beers, cider, and mixed drinks (try the fantastic dark-and-stormy!). It's a cool dive bar with super friendly staff and an awesome dark decor complete with couches and a pinball machine.

They have the best food menu we've seen at a bar: my fiancée loves the poutinette- a perfect cross-hatched stack of thickly cut potatoes, smoked gouda, and red-wine demi glas that'd be at home on a high end table, but served at a bar! Their dishes are an impressive selection of the better vendors in the market (Hooked, Sanagan's, Thomas Lavers).

If you want a low-key relaxed atmosphere with good drink and snacks you can't beat hitting up Handlebar early in the evening. Later it becomes one of the better venues in town (the NXNE show we caught last year was incredible). While I miss the Avro, I've maybe grown to love Handlebar more."}
{"text":"I would call this place a bit hidden, especially in a winter night, but most importantly they have one of the fanciest menus I have seen around, the rest is simple dark and cozy :)"}
{"text":"For all of my hipster hatred, I found myself at Handlebar last night and I had a wicked time! The atmosphere was dark and cavernous, adorned with old bicycles and the overall atmosphere was a super chill vibe. They had a dance floor and some wicked peeps spinning tunes. Being the Dancing Queen that I am, I was on that dance floor all night.

Bartenders were super friendly and made excellent cocktails. I'm not sure if all the people sitting down were eating???But I'm assuming they have food here, too?? When I'm dancing, I can't imagine why anyone would want to sit so I deduce that there must be some other equally exciting activity to keep them in their seats.

Handlebar also has what is arguably the most space age bank machine I've ever encountered.

I would definitely come back here for drinks any time."}
{"text":"cool atmosphere here! my boyfriend and i stumbled upon this bar on a saturday night. they're was a live band which was awesome because we like live music. there was a $5 cover which is no biggie and i assuming it was because of the band. drinks we tasty and decently priced. this bar is located in kensington market which offers lots of other bar options if you are looking to hop around."}
{"text":"Lively atmosphere with a pinball machine by the front. Quick bartender service and the drinks were well priced. Came for a quick drink to meet up with friends before moving on and it was a good time. Just a typical good neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"***NEW FAVOURITE BAR***

Owned by the same people who ran The Avro before it was rent-jacked out of existence, this is a place where I heartily recommend spending all of your dollars.

They have movie nights, dance nights and pleny of just totally chill nights where they play music at the perfect volume for you and whoever to easily hear each other expressing distaste with the mayor's latest performance art. Beers are well priced and the staff pay you just the right amount of attention.

There are pleny of booth and bar seats but easily the best place in the house is right by the front entrance where you can enjoy one of these small half-couches. Each one has a detachable, small oval table that's perfect for your drink. 

When you really push your butt into the couch facing the front window you're rewarded with a great view of the sky as framed by potted plants and illuminated by the lightbulb in the bicycle they have as part of the front display. For maximum value, have a beer in one hand (easy) and your other arm around a partner (hopefully easy, for your sake).

Wait, I want that seat all to myself. Why am I telling you about it?! Shit, why do I keep sabotaging my LIFE?

The one complaint I have is that the bar staff wouldn't compliment my big ol' dick, no matter how many times I asked them to do so. I will, of course, be taking this up with the appropriate government regulatory body.

Oh, I'm just kidding, the only thing lengthy about my dick would be the tragic poems it inspires on account of being so dang terrible."}
{"text":"This is my first time returning after the Elite event and I am pleased to say that the staff is still awesome and the atmosphere is still incredibly comfortable.

We came here for drinks on New Year's Eve, while waiting for the Boat across the street to start letting people in again. (they were at capacity)

There is a great variety of drinks to be had and the service is friendly. The Hubster and I found an intimate little table and hung out there most of the night, but moved to the bar later on. I'm a big fan of any bar that has a hook for purses. Why don't they all do this? 

If this place were stumbling distance to my house, I'd be in trouble."}
{"text":"Very relaxing and a good place to come with partner(s), friends or even just alone. Very hipster bar with events and live music on certain days.

Drinks are not mad expensive, and the staff are very friendly. There are many seats, including a nice outdoor patio. Also couches outside near the front of the bar. 

Definitely check out this place when you're around the Kensington area!"}
{"text":"Drink Here.  

...actually.. I had a tad too much to drink (thanks to Red) but I do remember the food being good too (some sandwich.. and again thanks to Red).  So... 

Eat Here Too."}
{"text":"You come here to drink if you like casual atmospheres, long bars, and friendly tenders. I've brought many friends here to share drinks, they all appreciated it's none BS approach to what a bar should really be. The drinks are made well and the bar keep holds a tab until you're ready to pay, simple as that.

Although this place is easy to look past or walk by, but it's certainly somewhere I go often. It's deceiving spacious with enough room to host a party and the bathrooms are always clean! Come to Handlebar to sit awhile and drink. There really isn't a place better to do that than here."}
{"text":"We came here for a friend's birthday - I was planning it, and looking for some place chill, where we can just invite as many people that would come, and just have some drinks, maybe some snacks.  A lot of places I called, asked for a minimum or bottle service, even though they were just a bar - but here, I emailed them and within minutes we were confirmed and ready to go. 

The place is really chill, I would come back again to have drinks with friends and catch up. It's small and narrow, with a back room which was private-ish and perfect for our group. A small stage at the back. It was dark back here though, but your eyes will adjust. 

They have lots of beer choices, and some wine. They also have Keiths Cider on tap. 

When we got here at 8ish, the place a completely empty, and we were able to decorate a little. With one bartender manning the bar, he didn't seem to know how the food menu worked which was a little disconcerting.  We asked what type of food we can get. Realized it wasn't much. Just some grilled sandwiches and nuts/chips/pickles on the menu. The sandwiches were custom, and we could choose from a bunch of ingredients, but then found out we were limited to only what they had in the fridge. 

So we ended up with $6 Grilled Cheese and Chicken sandwiches on plain white bread. $2 Bowls of PC Regular Chips and bowls of Pickles. A little over priced for not really quality. It would be nice if they had a little more to munch on. 

But the drinks were great. The service was friendly and super chill. They let us have the run of the place in the back which was nice. The music could have been more upbeat, but I'm sure we could have requested too. 

Overall, it a great place for the party, and I'd come back for drinks and to catch up on life one day. Just wish they had more choice of food/snacks."}
{"text":"Visited from out of town with my boyfriend. We arrived early enough to avoid paying a cover and got 2 really good seats near the front. The music was top notch, but still quiet enough to have a full on conversation. 

I've never had a dark and stormy (rum, ginger beer, lime) before, but it was so good I had to get 2. Will definitely go back if I get the chance."}
{"text":"Stopped in this weekend for the first time in a while. I don't spend as much time in Kensington Market as I used to but I've always liked this place as the general vibe is chill but approachable. After getting past the bar you'll find a decent sized dancefloor and then the one wall lined with booths which are pretty comfy.
Most nights I've been here the music seemed secondary to peoples reasoning for being there, which might match the fact that the sound system doesn't seem to be the highest quality. The Denon mixer being used by the dj probably doesn't help that either. But there are a lot of speakers hung from various parts of the walls so I imagine when the place fills up they can keep it pretty rocking in there.

Drinks are reasonably priced and they've got some good craft beer options on tap. 

Their website has a full monthly calendar of events which ranges from dj nights to live music to storytelling events and a wide variety of other random events. So my advice is check it out and plan your stop in to one of Kensingtons best bars."}
{"text":"This is a cool spot. I love the refurbished wood tables (I'm assuming refurbished, they reminded me of old school desks) and dark lighting. I came here as part of the Yelp Kensington Pub Crawl. I enjoyed a shot of whiskey, and felt like an old man. 

Handlebar is new, and not so easy to find on a side street to the main Kensington walkways. But its worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Tasty drinks and they do a fine sambo as well. 

Nice neat little patio, also the biking/moustache reference makes me laugh."}
{"text":"This place has it all. 
 
Kensington relaxed yet happening vibe, but the venue is larger than your typical Kensington nook in the wall which is nice. 

Multiple friendly bartenders behind very large bar, caters to crowds on the weekend.

Great patio out front; doorman had to enforce capacity out there in the most official sense, because he has to. Has a really nice attitude and has on a number of occasions let me join my friends on the full patio for a smoke if I left my drink inside. More than reasonable.

The kind of small dance floor that's just big enough to be there, in case some brave soul decides to bust a move so contagious that others follow, but small enough that no one is obligated--this is not club. 

DJ playing funky groove-to-it motown dance tunes last couple of times I was there. Music is not so loud that you can't hear a conversation. 

Booths line the left wall, and your grandmother's living room set is up front. Get drinkin, get chattin."}
{"text":"I can't go a day without handlebars (flobots reference) literally the best mustard sauce ever and that's not even the best part. There's at least twenty great things on the menu and the staff is awesome. Five stars for Steve!"}
{"text":"Not the fanciest place but the atmosphere is really fun and the service was amazing. Saw the wolf band play here. Great show great night"}
{"text":"My first night out in Toronto. And gotta say I had an absolute blast. Great bar. Good folks and amazing music. Must visit for all out on the west side"}
{"text":"Handlebar is a great place for meeting friends for a few beers in Kensington Market. The selection of beers on draught is quite good.

The vibe here is laid back and relaxed. It feels like the kind of place where anyone can have a good time. There is plenty of space inside, but also a nice west facing patio where you can relax after work.

The place opens at 6 p.m. on most weeknights."}
{"text":"My second time in Toronto, my gf wanted to check out this spot. Very romantic, smooth and cool spot. Must check it out."}
{"text":"Great space. Former Avro owners (Rachel and Bruce) are very pleasant people and engaged in the community too. A small patio out front coupled with a space in the back for live performances makes this one of my favourite bars in the city. Exceptional selection of beers from micros to giants. The mural is pretty weird though."}
{"text":"A great venue for casual drinks with friends.  Prices are really reasonable and the panini sandwiches are pretty delicious, served with pickles and olives.  Retro furniture may remind you of your grandparents' basement but in the best possible way.  I love the Muskoka chairs outside, what is it about sitting back in one of those bad boys and looking up to the 3 stars you can see in Toronto's sky?  

The one (very fixable) drawback that is noteworthy is that the subterranean washrooms are freezing and smell like a port-o-potty."}
{"text":"Stopped into Handlebar for my 2nd visit yesterday; sat at the bar and had a beer - Great Lakes' Brewery's Karma Citra - which was superb.  The service was quite efficient and friendly and I really admire the décor and ambiance of your venue.  Even got to see and hear the band setting up to perform and doing their sound check.  A quite pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Cool little place. Intimate, laid back, and apparently date night always.

Really, it's a nice little spot where you can get some good brews (but they need to get at least one ale on tap), decent selection of malts (though the scotch selection could be just a tad better). 
The bartenders are phenomenal, the space is cool - not trying to be, overall, an excellent little gem in the city."}
{"text":"VIBE 
I like this bar! It's a bit dark and it feels a little bit like a secret even though there's a huge patio out front. No signage. Staff are nice. 

I DRANK
A gimlet! Then I had a gin and tonic. Good and boozy. It was hard to see the menu to be honest so I don't know if there are other cocktails on offer. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Why do they call it Handlebar? Handlebar moustache or for the bikes?"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place to watch OkStupid (an event where people get together and read out the worst conversations they've had on online dating sites) and absolutely fell in love with it.

It's the kind of dive(ish) bar that actually has charm, love and a lack of stickiness. There's a good range of local beers and the tastiest ginger beer (non-alcoholic) I have ever tasted. Try the Dark & Stormy, very satisfying!  And the prices are very reasonable. 

Another great aspect about this place is the food. Once in awhile they'll have specials where you can grab a delicious meal, very reasonably and very flavourful. Their regular food is alright but not always hitting the mark (stacking up fries like Lincoln logs for a poutine dish seems unnecessarily fancy and looks bizarre). 

While the service is never rude, there's certainly a bit more priority to their friends. Be prepared to wait awhile for drink service as there's typically no rush on their end to serve. 

I highly recommend this place if you want a low key relaxing night."}
{"text":"Visited a second time and I gotta say this place is growing on me.  I think it's a perfect addition to the Augusta strip!!!"}
{"text":"We went on Tuesday night and it was a blast!  Highly recommend it for a fun night of karaoke and dancing!"}
{"text":"Great place to drink with friends, a mate or alone. Seems like a spot that you can always make new friends or get to know the regulars.

I came here from NYC to sit in and watch I am Robot and proud, a kool band you must check out if you don't already know them.  Awesome group and music, and this bar was a perfect fit. Cozy, chill and somehow felt special... I don't maybe that's the beer taking =)

We'll comeback on my next trip."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a pint and check out some live music.   Highly recommended and in the heart of Kensington."}
{"text":"I came here on a random Monday night. Yes it's open on Monday late. 
- Intimate, casual, dim candle-lit ambiance
- Booth seating
- Hip but not overly-hip, adorned with bicycles along the wall
- Cheap cocktails -love their dark and stormy (~$7)
- Chill with just a bit of people not overly crowded just the way I like it
- If you're looking for a place to dance, not Monday night

All I want in a bar at the moment. I can't comment on the busier nights though."}
{"text":"Fun spot. Good crowd. Good music. Cheap drinks. Nice little patio in the heart of Kensington market. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"We went for their New Year's party. Music was decent and it was cool that the DJ was a woman. Besides that, the bartender we interacted with had a horrible attitude and we soon left after the countdown. If visiting, I'd skip this place"}
{"text":"A delightful evening with good (fairly priced) drinks and solid music in a relaxing atmosphere. Dark and stormy and the old fashioned were enjoyable. I'd revisit"}
{"text":"Dropped by here last night with some rowdy Yelpers on a Kensington Pub Krawl. (Holla!) There were meant to be 2 stops after this joint, but the guys at Handlebar were treating us right. So a unanimous drunken decision was made to remain at Handlebar and continue to get drunk on whiskey, bourbon and great craft beer. 

This was a dive-bar crawl, but once inside Handlebar I realized it's anything but divey. They have taken great care in decorating the inside with one-of-kind narrow wooden tables and bicycles.

They had a sandwich special which some people enjoyed, but I was on a strictly liquid diet. Bullet whiskey is delicious. You know what's not? Keith's cider. Keith's cider tastes like the two litre ciders they sell at the Wine Rack. It's really sweet and undwerwhelming. Avoid it.*

PEPPER POINTS: For their large front patio. Great for people watching.

PEPPER'S PISSED: About the AC. Turn it down, boys. I know you're big guys but I was faaareeeezzzing. Going pee was akin to peeing in an outhouse. While winter camping. 

*I'm from Nova Scotia and it pains me to diss a Keith's product."}
{"text":"Came here with 3 ppl on a Saturday night. It reminds me of the hipster bars in Brooklyn. The ambiance was great, cocktails were average and music was a bit loud but I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Like stepping through a time warp...good pricing on drinks...all things considered
Music is my only complaint..."}
{"text":"Pretty good little dive bar in the Kensington Market area. They charge a \"pay what you can\" cover which is cool. The drinks here are about average price. Service was good here as well. My friend and I sat at the bar and it wasn't long before the bartender came over to serve us. I had a paper plane cocktail and it was made perfectly."}
