{"text":"Atmosphere, service and food was good. We had a table next to the window so view of the water was great. We both had the filet mignon which was very tender and mashed potatoes had wonderful flavor. Husband had the lobster bisque soup which he loved and said there were several large chunks of lobster. Salad bar was also very fresh."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner, great view and great waiter, Tony!  What a terrific Valentine's Eve dinner."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting. Highly recommend crab stuffed prawns and Filet Mignon. Salad bar is the best I've ever had ~ with a Caesar chef and caviar. Friendly clientele includes a lot of loyal locals. Note: It lost a star for the distracted greeting upon arrival and terse server."}
{"text":"This restaurant on a beautiful lake is a really relaxing experience. The happy hour is worth checking out, the food is really tasty! I especially like the prime rib sliders with creamy horseradish. The spinach dip with toasted baguette slices for dipping is yummy. They have a happy hour menu with something for everyone. They also have an unbelievable salad bar. There's a bit of an 80's country club vibe but I dig it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has just slipped by me all these years. We had late evening reservations for a party of 7. We arrived while it was still light out so we were able to see the view of the water. Shortly after it got dark but a monsoon storm rolled in giving us a spectacular light show. Our server Joshua was super efficient, friendly, good with the children in our party, and pretty funny too. Each entree was more than enough for each of us, and every one of us enjoyed the taste and presentation. Not a single complaint and wouldnt change a thing. I know Chart House has been open for years and I hope they stay open for many more!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is real nice especially sitting on the patio.  We use to go here all the time, they have a nice salad bar even through the price keeps increasing.  I do not eat caviar so maybe a different price for folks who do not eat caviar would be better but paying $17.00 for a salad bar is kind of too expensive.. We do not go here much anymore as we recently found out there calm chowder comes from a can rather than homemade and all their meats and fish dishes are farm raised nothing is grass fed or organic.  They do not  buy the cream of the crop meats and prefer farm raised.  Imagine paying close to $20. for farm raised Atlantic salmon.  Not a good value for food especially since such poor quality.  Nice atmosphere and great wait staff but nothing else."}
{"text":"We've been to many chart houses for the last 34 years.  I'm not so sure about this location. My lobster was very chewy.  We asked for hot butter and it was barely warm.  It's disappointing compared to other locations.  Our favorite is Redondo Beach where we had out first days in 1981. The table next to us received great service in comparison. Marcos is our server.  Our lobster was served while we watched the fireworks on the patio.  We were gone for no more than 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Originally I wanted to come here because of my previous experience at a different ChartHouse (Portland, OR) & I remember everything being top notch there.   Despite reviews, my husband & I decided to come here for our first wedding anniversary. Upon arrival, we noticed that it was pretty empty inside, but just played it off for being a Monday evening.  Our waitress was great, lots of personality & recommendations, & of course she was super friendly.. But theres a couple things where my experience just fell super short. For one, service was SO SLOW-- especially for it being a Monday evening & only 5 other people there that I could count. We ordered drinks right away & asked if we wanted any bread.. Well, our drinks came after our appetizers for one (about 20 mins after being seated), & the bread never even showed. I guess it was forgotten?  For appetizers we had the kimchee calamari & my husband ordered a crab cake-- both were delicious! For entrees we got the salmon with artichoke & he got the prime rib, then of course you cant forget dessert-- chocolate lava cake w/ peanut butter ice cream (housemade). All the food was great, but I can't overlook the extremely slow service, especially on a dead evening. I hope something is done to improve service soon because I would love to give this CH a second chance!"}
{"text":"Easter Sunday with friends.. Perfect table outside on the patio. We started with a few drinks and appetizers. The shrimp and crab Stack appetizer  was recommended by our server Michael. It was an excellent recommendation.  He was a terrific server!  We also had the hummus trio which was also delightful. We all voted for the Chilean Seabass special at $35 ea... two were spicy two were not...they  had shrimp and crabmeat on top!! Delicious !!  The gentleman ordered mud pie for dessert as well as a bowl of berries with pineapple. Everyone left full and happy!!   It was a wonderful afternoon with great friends,  food and service. Looking to back again soon !"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and the server, Lindsey, was the best BUT the shrimp in my stuffed shrimp was over cooked and they forgot to bring our creamed spinach with the meal, which I have had better. For the price I would expect a better quality of food. For what we paid and what we got, we could have gone to not so fancy place for half the bucks."}
