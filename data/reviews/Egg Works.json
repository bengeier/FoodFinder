{"text":"Food was great service was excellent love coming hereand definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Especially our waitress! Ask for LuAnna every time! She always makes sure everything is perfect! Even special requests for our kids! Great food, great family atmosphere, and great service!"}
{"text":"This place serves some of the best breakfast in Las Vegas and our server Candace was amazing as usual--fast, helpful and good attitude."}
{"text":"This place is back up to snuff for me.  The trick if you're a pancake lover and picky is to ask for them to make them very thin. Improves the blueberry to batter ratio significantly and improves the taste.  The staff is much better than they were for a while. Back to loving it."}
{"text":"Wow, I feel bad for everyone who wrote glowing reviews.  They obviously have been subjected to really awful food all of their life.  I got the chicken fried steak with over medium eggs and one of the muffins everyone raved about.  Everything came with enough salt to preserve my digestive organs for the afterlife.  The potatoes are cheap, frozen cubes soaked in season salt...inedible.  the gravy was also way overseasoned, might of had some potential if not for that.  The banana nut muffin was nothing to write home about and had a weird texture.  The husband got the avocado bacon omelette.  Though he is a hearty eater, two thirds of his food was left behind.  The omelette had a ton of cheese melted over top, usually a good thing, not in this case.  The cheese looked plastic like and he said it tasted microwaved.  He too had a large portion of blood pressure killing potatoes.  The kid had chocolate chip pancakes.  Nothing to write home about but apparently way better than what we got.  $41 for this lousy meal.  When we paid, the lady asked how everything was and my husband replied very salty and terribly overseasoned.  She responded by giggling like a school girl and telling him the total.  Way to handle a complaint there.  A $2 egg mcmuffin beats this junk any day."}
{"text":"This has been our regular breakfast spot for nearly 9 years! We love the traditional benny and the carnitas skillet! We've had delicious lunches here as well but always crave breakfast! It is a bit pricey, but the service is speedy, friendly, and efficient! Michelle was great this morning!"}
{"text":"Nice place.. Get a reservation before coming... Veggie skillet was good. Must try banana muffin..."}
{"text":"Great traditional American food. Excellent service provided by Tanya and the entire staff."}
{"text":"Still very good food and an excellent value relative to the strip. Today the eggs, gravy and biscuits were amazing. The potatoes came fresh but were over-salted and almost inedible. The side of sausage came when I was halfway through the meal. Usually when I come here the service is really good, today, it was just ok. The restaurant was pretty busy (noon on a Friday) and the service was a bit frantic and at times hard to get. The waiter didn't even bother giving his name or asking for a Yelp review, perhaps he already knew things had been a bit subpar (the receipt listed CJ as the waiter). Still, on average, a very good restaurant and I recommend it."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, seriously the strawberry cream cheese French Toast made me pre-cum.  And my server Donna was exceptional."}
{"text":"We stopped here after early morning Walmart shopping for New years Eve. We had the Huevo Rancheros and I had the banana bread french toast. The BNFT was unbelievable. I would get it again in a heartbeat.   Our server was Sarah and she was very attentive and wonderful."}
{"text":"Visited Egg Works this morning with my boyfriend and had great service from Amanda! Awesomeness. .. Breakfast was excellent. We definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Heather is awesome! Disneyland here she comes! Egg Works has one of the best breakfast in Las Vegas. California Crepe is delicious. A huge plate of goodness!"}
{"text":"After a couple more visits here I drop the rating to 3 stars, the service is consistently bad. The food was good as usual though it was slightly undercooked."}
{"text":"Tely was wonderful and the food was great! O recommend eating here for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome variety, which means it's a good place to take picky eaters!   I decided on corn hash plate- way too salty for my taste. A lot of the other guests recommended it. I would of went with eggs Benedict, but was willing to try it!   General consensus from everyone in my party is that we would try again, since there are other options. Dishes we all ordered were just okay.   We went on a Sunday around 12, and the wait was about 30 minutes.   Banana nut muffin was great! Make sure you check in and get a free one :)"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place. Wide variety of food, perfect portion sizes for the hungry. Server was Veronica, attentive and upbeat despite the deathly hour of 6am. Definitely plan on coming back again."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Vegas visiting my Sister and her Husband. They suggested that we try the Egg Works for Breakfast was a very good suggestion.   I had a 3 meat skillet and my Wife has the blackened rib-eye and spinach Benedict. Both meals were great and the wait staff were a pleasure.   We enjoyed The Egg Works so much, we went back the next day!"}
{"text":"Egg Works should be called - EGG WORST:  This place was absolutely Horrible.  The food was bland and their Specialty Potatoes were Salty as Hell.    Service  was extremely slow.  We had 3 different waitresses tell us they would be serving us in the first 4 minutes we were seated.  And it took forever for the food to come out.  But amazingly our Bill came out before we took the first bite of our food.  I guess they didn't wanna give us a chance to complain about or ask for a refund for any of our  food that they knew was nasty before it hit the table.  Not 1 of the 4 of us at our table enjoyed any of our meals.  All left with more than half the food on our plates. I drank the water to fill me up.  That was the best part of the entire meal.  THE WATER.  I dont recommend this place to anyone who likes any flavor to their food at all.  And if you have any hint of High Blood Pressure,  dont eat their Salt Of Death Potatoes,  because you will have to take your High Blood Pressure Pills and call for an Ambulance before you leave there.   This Place Absolutely Sucks."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, me and my neighbor consider this our place to catch up and discuss our week.  Great place, great service. Using the Groupon was super easy, though prices are super reasonable even without coupons."}
{"text":"Well run breakfast/lunch spot! Food was great. And service spot on! Thank you, Brandy!"}
{"text":"Danielle helped us today and she was awesome! Very eggcellent service! Always asking us 8f we needed anything and making us feel important! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The service was great. I ordered the Works Scramble and while it was tasty it was a bit heavy on the salty feta. The portions are big."}
{"text":"Great food and not expensive. Muffins are the best!!! There went my diet !! Very friendly people too"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast before heading home to LA. Service was great and staff was super friendly. Was told the wait time would be 25 mins, but got seated in 15.  The food: Banana Nut Muffins -  must try!! Very moist and YUMMY!  Corned Beef Hash - better than expected. Wasn't as salty as other places! Carnitas Crepe -  Crepe was Meh,  but the carnitas were moist and full of flavor! The salsa verde it came with had great taste, with very little heat (not spicy for me at all)  Mashed Potato Omelette -  garlic mashed potatoes inside a omelette with chopped bacon makes unique combo. A lil too heavy,  but delicious nonetheless.   Country Fried Steak Skillet - the fried steak was cut up on a bed of their seasoned potatoes and smothered with gravy, topped with eggs (we asked for scrambled)  Bowl of Cincy Chili -  (had to try) an acquired taste. Not something we were used to. Couldn't help it. A sucker for chili, just had to give it a try."}
{"text":"It would get less than 1 star if possible.    When this branch on Eastern in Henderson first opened they appeared to make an effort to please the local customer base.  We have tried it three or four times.  We have not been here for a couple of months.    Oh my, how fast it has become a has been.  No more tries at this particular site.    One order was wrong and the waitress was admittedly 'sorry', enough to offer to 'take care of it' without us asking.  Her idea of taking care of the matter  was to write a note on the ticket \"Wrong omelet, but ate anyways\"... it was half eaten because we were looking for the ham, when we realized it was a mistake we notified the waitress, who did little but write a very rude note and attach it to our check.    The other order was served incorrectly also, but- with much delay- corrected.  We left without finishing half of either meal.  We left a small tip anyways for a small effort.  The cheery serving staff that was here at the opening has left behind a rather bland, unpleasant staff that is only half interested in making this site as homey as other ones.    With so many offerings in the Las Vegas area for breakfast, it would be a better experience to give your business to a nearby alternative, in fact, any nearby alternative."}
{"text":"So we all know about the food at the Egg Works nothing additional to add, always top notch and this visit was no different. Exactly what we've come to expect, except for one thing. The service was extraordinary! If I could leave 10stars I would.  Manuela far exceeded any expectations that we had. Her bright smile and bubbly personality only added to an exceptional experience.   Manuela thank you for all you do."}
{"text":"Plates were dirty. Coffee cups smells like they were cooking eggs . It makes u feel u dont want to eat eggs anymore."}
{"text":"Do you love eggs for breakfast? Well Egg Works is a great place to start up your day, you get the protein that you need and why not have it a way that you can enjoy. If your not an egg eating person no worries, they have french toast, waffles, pancakes, crepes, burgers and sandwiches.  The location is great, good amount of parking, and the staff is very friendly. Sounds to me that this place would be a great place to eat and bring your family or friends. Not an early bird? It's okay they are open until 3PM, perfect for brunch.   Tried so far:  Chili Omelette (yummy in my tummy)  The Classic (plain ol' me)  Greek Scramble (gotta love the feta)  Cabo Breakfast Burrito (say OLE)  Banana Nut Muffin (to die for)  Banana Nut French Toast (a little sweet but good)"}
{"text":"The food was just out of this world and the server Daria was the best grade A+ all around thank you for a great breakfast I'm full okay later"}
{"text":"Always love coming to Egg Works! Lisa C. Is a top rate server. Her attentiveness and anticipation makes the experience great."}
{"text":"This is a follow up from my 1st review.  We had a bad experience the 1st time we visited.  HOWEVER, the General Manager reached out to me after I posted a review on Yelp.com.  He had apologized and insisted we return.  We visited again, and had terrific service from one of the servers.  We were there on a busy Sunday morning; and expected to wait but, instead the host asked if we would like to sit at the the bar area.  The server was very friendly; we got food fairly quick considering it was busy.  They had plenty of servers available.    The seasoned potatoes were really good.  I would order those again.  We will definitely come back to try other other items on the menu.  They have a variety of breakfast items."}
{"text":"When my parents come to visit from California, we always go here for breakfast.  The service was impeccable, and the food was delicious.  Donna, our server, was friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful with suggestions.  The wait to get a table was about ten minutes, but on a Saturday morning, that's not too bad.  The food came quickly, and everyone loved their meals."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's our favorite breakfast spot. Staff is always nice and welcoming. A great place to bring my 3-year-old. I love the spinach Benedict and my hubby always get his biscuit and gravy. The banana muffin is addicting too!"}
{"text":"Stick to eggs pancakes and waffles, I tried their huevos rancheros since a big corner of the menu featured this item, what a dissapointment, 30 minutes later to discover it was nothing more than a can of dennisons chili beans mixed with eggs"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast! Huge portions so me and my dude were glad we shared. Had what our server Caitlin suggested; the Santa Cruz Skillet with avocado on the side. Didn't even need sour cream bc of the enchilada sauce! And a free, ridiculously yummy banana nut muffin since we checked in! Bonus"}
{"text":"Good Place for breakfast! Fun decoration / wall art. Banana Nut muffin was awesome and a nice alternative to toast, I was HAPPIEST to have it. Miranda was a spectacular server as well, not bothersome and well timed being at the right PLACE at the right time. ON my next trip to town I will definitely stop by and maybe try a skillet. You can't go wrong with this very down to EARTH breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Eggs works is the best breakfast place in Las Vegas!!! Emily our server was very attentive and always was there when we needed something and brought our things really quick!!! She was the best that we will return for sure! Thanks Emily!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Great customer service!! Will recommend to everyone!! Love the breakfast burrito!!"}
{"text":"Finally I can get my local breakfast fix! Awesome food and PK served us and he was awesome. Get the island favorites it's amazing."}
{"text":"Great service from Donna on Sunset and Eastern!!  Thanks, Donna!"}
{"text":"Donna was attentive, friendly and upbeat. We always enjoy coming here. We had a little mishap with one of our dishes but Kady took care of us. Hands down the best service every time we come! Thanks Donna!"}
{"text":"Our server Donna was amazing. It was our first time there and she gave us a free muffin and the food was great. Thank you Donna!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Egg Works - we actually were seated with a server we have had at this location before, Daria, and she did a great job of making sure our meal was pleasant and we had everything we needed.  The food was simple but fresh and the skillet potatoes are always a highlight.  Also nice to support a more local restaurant chain in Las Vegas!    They are good for vegetarians but not necessarily vegans or those with nut allergies so be aware that the menu is fairly egg and cheese centric."}
{"text":"We went here two mornings in a row during our week stay out here. I loved it! So did my husband. The crepes are amazing and the pancakes are DELISH!! The service was amazing and our server was so awesome. Their portions are HUGE so our server helped me out when I started ordering more than he though I could eat (he was right). He offered a half crepe and wow was it still a lot lol. It's one of our go to's now whenever we are in town! My parents also enjoyed it a lot too! Thank you Egg Works!"}
{"text":"Food was great, our waitress Brandy was attentive, kind and knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"This is where hangovers and brunch collide brilliantly. Breakfast served till 3pm with quality and über service by the entire staff if needed. Need something, not happy, just flip your \"Egg\" from happy to sad and the world is your oyster. Amy was our server with a smile, who took hospitality to the next level.  No sad \"egg\" faces on this trip and will undoubtedly be back."}
{"text":"Great food. The service was great from the moment we walked in the door. Had a Bloody Mary with my breakfast and it was on of the best I have had. Had the country Benny and it was wonderful. Lots of food. The banana muffin was great. If your in the area it is a must stop."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Try the Cincinnati chili. Best west of Indiana. Friends had steak and eggs, all cooked exactly as ordered. I had Cincinnati Chili skillet. Bran muffin is made fresh. The management was sampling pizza for customers and they were very tasty. I've had their lunch/burger and it is also first-rate. They have three locations and all have the same consistently high quality and friendly professional service."}
{"text":"Egg Works is a great breakfast and lunch diner. But, it is also home to the best Cincinnati chili west of Western Hills. They are expanding all over town. Go for a 3, 4 or 5-Way and life is good. Very friendly staff and solid service."}
{"text":"This place is soo good! Jessica our waitress was really friendly and got everything right. She also came to check on us very frequently even though we were in a back room because our party was so big."}
{"text":"Your typical breakfast place, but since it's close to my house and they've always taken care of me. Plus, they have TVs running sportscenter usually."}
{"text":"Deanna is a very good server. Everything turned out perfect and in a timely matter. We love going ti Egg Works. We always get good service. People are very friendly at thi restaurant."}
{"text":"Breakfast on 4/15/14 was wonderful. Our server Veronica was amazing. We will definitely return for more meals with the rest of our family and friends."}
{"text":"On Aug. 10, 2015 we enjoyed breakfast at our favorite Eggworks in Las Vegas.  Victoria, our server, was just the most enjoyable besides the food.  She cleaned tables, all with such good attitude.  She is probably one of the best servers we've had in the three locations we frequent.  She definitely could go a long way in restuarant management, food service industry.  Her outgoing, happy personality is a winner!!"}
{"text":"My husband ordered New York Steak and Egg and I ordered Prime Rib Bene. I heard about the Prime Rib Bene and wanna try it and that's the only item I wanted that night off the menu.  So the food came...... my husband found a hair on the steak when cutting it. He got grossed out and I got grossed out. I wanna throw up after seeing that hair though the hair wasn't on my plate. So I went out to grab the manager and told her about it. The manager felt bad and took away the steak and asked the kitchen to remake it for him.   Then I am not sure if I was simply grossed out by that hair or my dish was really having problem. There were couple bites that felt very sandy on my mouth. At one point I couldn't tolerate the sandy feeling anymore so I told the manager about it. But I guess she was questioning in her head whether I was making it up after seeing her comping my husband's dish. She didn't look very nice when I was telling her about my concern of the sandy feeling. (I told her it was so grainy and asked if this dish was supposed to be like that, maybe I didn't state the problem clear enough making her wondering) But I really didn't make it up. Just too bad that the feeling was in my mouth, I couldn't really pick out anything that seemed sandy for her to see visually. But she did offer to remake it and at the end comped my dish too. (I hope they didn't spit on my food when they remake mine)  It was a mix feeling. I felt bad for her needing to comp our meals, but I really couldn't tolerate that sandy feeling in my mouth when chewing my food, and my husband definitely couldn't tolerate eating a steak that had someone's hair on it. So we felt bad for the trouble they had to go through but at the same time it's really not our fault. The situation was a bit uncomfortable so we probably just won't go back, because we would just be worried if we would find anything again in the food if we go back there, and worry about if it will end up in an uncomfortable situation again....so might as well not to go back then."}
{"text":"The hubby and I eat here almost every weekend for breakfast.  Always good!   he's a bit picky... and the waitresses never get irritated. Banana nut muffins rock, and I love sitting on the patio for the views.. not a fan of people bringing their dogs to sit out there.. but other than that.. its one of my FAV places."}
{"text":"Great service this morning.  The food is always good but this morning our server, McKenzie, was exceptional.  Service was fast, efficient and polite.  She was friendly without being chatty, very professional."}
{"text":"I am always a fan of EggWorks - love love love their banana nut muffin too by the way.  Not such a good experience with the pancakes though this past weekend.....They were extremely chewy and undercooked =T  They were so chewy that they were sticking to my teeth as I ate them.  Their omelets, crepes, skillet breakfasts are all fantastic though, so this is definitely the way to go when eating here.  Their pancakes did not scare me away and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I rarely yelp, I'm not into the fad however when I feel a place deserves recognition, I will... Anyways, Emily our server was wonderful took care of us wonderfully even tho she was busy. The banana muffins are absolutely superb. My skillet was so good. Great portions I couldn't even finish it. Great first time experience... I totally recommend this place"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful breakfast and our server Donna, was extremely attentive to our needs!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here after arriving in Las Vegas. From the very time we entered the restaurant, the customer service was outstanding. Tely was our waitress and was so nice and helped us choose what to order because the menu is very extensive! It was 10am on a Friday and the place was packed, but we never felt rushed. My husband's omelet came missing something and Tely and the manager went above and beyond to correct it, gave us a coupon, and muffins to go. The food was awesome (I got the county Benny and hubs got the chicken omelet and the banana nut muffins - amazing!), but the customer service is what really stood out. We will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Every once in a while my wife has been dragging me here and I have chiefly disliked the enormous quantity of food you get with a single entry. Today, when we were ordering omlettes the waitress asked us if we would like them with 2 or 4 eggs. We said 2 eggs and therefore got a reasonable size meal. (They also came with potatoes or fruit and a muffin or toast.) The smaller option wasn't on the menu--it was a couple of bucks cheaper--and, possibly, the waitress only offered it to us because she sized us up as seniors. However, getting a reasonably sized omlette makes this a much more attractive place for me. I found the veggie omlette quite good and with two eggs right sized. The selection of fresh fruits was also good."}
{"text":"Manny was awesome!! Food was amazing!! Service Was amazing!!! Awesome breakfast place to go!! Chicken fried steak and eggs was delicious, prime rib Benny was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Service was great but the food was so salty especially the potatoes that came with everyones breakfast. I felt sick all day."}
{"text":"Egg works was just as I suspected and up to my expectations of providing great country hearty style breakfast. To top it off Ashley was my waitress and she is awesome and was a delight to conservate with and beautiful to look at. See you next time Ashley, thanks!"}
{"text":"Breakfast at Egg Works Anthem has become a  weekly event with my family.  We love the atmosphere and the service is always excellent. P.K. is super friendly and makes us feel at home. He makes our trips to the restaurant feel personal instead of being just another table to turn quickly."}
{"text":"Pet friendly? If you can get a patio table along side of the fence you can leave the pets OUTSIDE the fenced patio area. The pets have to sit on a sidewalk where people are regularly walking by. I don't consider this pet friendly."}
{"text":"Donna provided excellent service and was attentive to our needs. She was pleasant and provided quality service. Table 36. Sunset and Pecos on Saturday May 9 2015."}
{"text":"Yes, potatoes! That is one reason why I love this place. And their banana muffins are another reason. I love the happy and cheery customer service. Classic breakfasts to their own spins on classic favorites are all delicious no matter what you are in the mood for. This place is my go-to for a great breakfast. Shout out to Candace, our server -  for taking awesome care of us!"}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly. Our waitress, Amanda, super friendly, very nice and she jingled. (its Christmas time) soooo cute. Always loved their hot chocolate, potatoes and they always make my eggs perfect. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service by Charmagne. The bf and I are going to go track her down to her new location. She was great and sweet with us on just making sure you feel right at home and makes sure what you asked/ordered is to perfection. Great service overall on this location. All the server's are great. I love the attention and detail they put in their customers. Mgt is doing a great job."}
{"text":"Thank you Lisa C for being our server. You are one of the outstanding waitress to us. Thank you."}
{"text":"Yelp it  First time there, Great Service, had breakfast was very good. I would go back.   Home cook meals  Excellent Banana Muffin"}
{"text":"Chelsea was awsom and food was outstanding. Only issue was she routes for the wrong soccer team"}
{"text":"Really wish I could give it the full 5 as it has amazing breakfast choices and delicious food, but I wasn't as pleased the last time I went. Every time I eat here I get amazing service from very pleasant employees which isn't a problem at all. Just the last time I was here I was drinking my soda and a piece of old food came up my straw. Didn't say anything, then a hair was in my drink, STILL didn't say anything then once I finished my breakfast I looked at the bottom of the plate and noticed another hair :("}
{"text":"Ray was super friendly and made our first visit here very delightful!!!! He was super helpful and gave fantastic customer service. We will def be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!   Diane is an awesome waitress, we were in a hurry and she hooked us up all the way through the meal. And got us out fast!  Will definitely be back and would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Adanely thank you so much for a great breakfast experience. The fruit was the best part of my meal."}
{"text":"We were told about egg works from a friend that lived in Vegas.It is not disappointing.. Great service today from Eden .Great food as well"}
{"text":"The waitress Donna was amazing it was my bday she and her co workers sang to me she was very energetic and always came back to check up on us best service ive had in a long time"}
{"text":"Come here before I go to work and love the place. Great food, service and the staff is very friendly. This time I had the bacon and avocado omelet and it was great. They serve to many potatoes and they are great.. ha ha Love the potatoes but I need to watch how much I eat and it's tough not to eat them all. I sit at the counter and Raul was right on top of thing."}
{"text":"Banana nut muffin was delicious and warm!! The place was great, casual, comfy and the avocado and bacon omelette was perfect:)"}
{"text":"Mario is an exceptional server!    He's friendly, funny, and exhibits a refreshingly great attitude!   Thank you for starting our day off right!!!!!!"}
{"text":"In such a cute neighborhood, in a beautiful complex, sits this breakfast chain. First, the decor is that of a preschool with a train-theme and florescent lightening. We choose to sit outside. The view of the mountains was nice.   After ordering eggs and turkey bacon, and a skillet, we got the banana nut muffin. It was warm and was a nice touch. The rest of the food was were it starts to get bad. The potatoes were heavily seasoned for a breakfast dish but that could just be a preference. The turkey sausage looked like flat lumps of mushed meat- tasted as described.   But here's were it gets the worst for me, the price was 25 dollars and some change. In my opinion, go down the street a ways to Tivoli Village, Leone Cafe and eat a beautiful meal, in a gorgeous atmosphere, for the same price. The quality of food at Egg Works was not worth it. Luckily we had a coupon. Still, would have chosen the other breakfast spot over Egg Works.   Hoped this place was going to become our new neighborhood breakfast spot but instead we were completely disappointed in everything about this establishment."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and our server Perry was very friendly, a must if you want a good breakfast."}
{"text":"I love that they have a choice of Irish cream for their coffee. Most places I've gone to out in Vegas only have regular creamer, half and half, hazelnut, and/or vanilla. Their banana nut muffin is great. I alway get their country fried steak which is also wonderful, especially as leftovers. The hot sauces are worth trying and their service is usually pretty good. They get quite busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"I have been here one time before, when they first opened. It was pretty decent tho  rather expensive for breakfast. This particular time my food was very very salty and my biscuits and gravy were lukewarm at best. A bit of a bummer."}
{"text":"Love going here!  Bacon and avocado omlet was delicious. I will continue to make this place my number one breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Most enjoyable. We ordered waffles, blueberry pancakes, classic Benedict, breakfast burrito, and everything was delicious. Wait staff was extremely friendly and very accommodating in our rush to finish our breakfast to get to a wedding in a chapel.   Definitely will eat here again on our next visit and recommend anyone else in the area to eat here."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast / lunch / brunch in Summerlin. They have a massive menu all of it looks good. Not often do I find Cincinnati Chili outside of Ohio. I have Moco w/ Cincinnati Chili, and it was heavenly,  the portions are enormous, prices are fair, service excellent. The place is Hella popular, so be prepared to wait, but it's worth it.   My only regret was waiting 7 months to try it!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious omelet and the beat service from a waiter named Marc!!! What an awesome and helpful guy!!"}
{"text":"Went to breakfast here with my fiance and we received fast service. Food was great and servred veryquickly. Our Servier Nicole was on top of serving us and making sure we were not needing or wanting anything else.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Good basic all-American breakfast place. Nice selection, good food, good prices. Solid, working-class, hearty food--nothing fancy or gourmet. This ain't the Strip."}
{"text":"Christian our waiter was awesome and entertaining, had the spinach benny and bacon an egg avocado omelette ( it is exactly as advertised.) wait was a bit long but the food and overall experience was totally worth it"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! Friendly staff! Huge portions! I devoured the bacon avocado omelette and loved the addition of sour cream on top. Will definitely be back if ever in the area again!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Maria was great!  This may become my go to breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Egg-cellent food and service! Our waitress, Dee, was so friendly and efficient. Chicken fried steak and the huevos ranchero omelet were yummy!"}
{"text":"Good food,excellent and extremely fast service. Great if you're looking for a tasty meal that is quick but not fast food. My omelette was yum.. Hard to mess up an omelette tho. Also reasonably priced. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Food is always good.. My husband really liked the Philly Cheesesteak. Our server today was Nicole and she was very friendly and attentive.. Thanks Nicole"}
{"text":"Recently had a group lunch here...while the food was good...the service was unbelievable.  We were a large group and Victoria who waited on us alone...was the epitome of great service. Not only did she take orders from 17+, she got the orders correct, and prepared separate checks and didn't skip a beat with making sure drinks were refilled in a timely manner and got us in and out within our allotted time constraint...kudos...she was amazing...we'll  me back!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing' I had the stuffed French toast today! But, somehow my server Nicole was even better than the food. Always my first stop for breakfast after a long flight home!"}
{"text":"We came in for breakfast on a busy Sunday morning. The wait was only a few minutes and we had drinks within a minute of sitting down. Our server Chance took our order and verified it since my spouse has special dietary requirements. When the food came out it was just as we had ordered. Chance came back several times to verify everything was OK, and she managed to be social and entertaining while continuing to take care of all her tables. Next time we go back, we're asking for Chance!"}
{"text":"Veggie Benny not so veggie?? Thought it was supposed to be a tomato but turned out to be ham?? So confused... I do love this place and usually choose them over mimis (that got me sick on valentines day) and eww  dennys and ihop yuck! I'm disappointed but will return."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service better. The plate far exceeded my expectations both in quantity and quality with the added bonus of the wonderful server Roslin who took care of all my needs as well as provided well advised selections."}
{"text":"Loved it everything is delicious starting from eggs to pancakes . Service is amazing .. Candice was super we loved her"}
{"text":"Large portions of decent food (large enough to share) and good friendly service."}
{"text":"First time here and DONNA made me feel so welcome and provided excellent service!  Delicious food as well!"}

{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots.. Our server donna was friendly and courteous always a pleasure"}
{"text":"Nelly was soooo helpful. First time here. Highly impressed!!! Will come back! Impressive! Recommend corned beef!Thank you Nelly!"}
{"text":"Egg works restaurant good food good service especially Donna our server! Will be back."}
{"text":"The service was really good. Shantel was excellent and has a great sense of humor. The whole staff was really great in general. I watched them a little and noticed how well they were working together. That alone makes it worth returning.   The food was good. I got a waffle which wasn't awesome but it was good. I think next time I should try some of the stuff that they are known for."}
{"text":"Veronica, our server was great. We always come here for breakfast and the service has always been great. They have a friendly staff that is always ready to help. I recommended the chili relleno omelet and splitting it with a friend."}
{"text":"We eat here occasionally, just had lunch the other day. Food was SOLID as always. Unfortunately our server, Christian, I believe his name was was almost unbearable. I have never had poor service here but he definitely made our lunch awkward and his behavior was blatantly even annoying his coworkers.   My dad will probably never come here again if only to avoid this waiters \"Joe Pesci\" shtick"}
{"text":"Went I with my family on Saturday morning, place wasn't too busy when we arrived, walked right in. Very surprised since it was around. 9:30. Anyways, menus are pretty nifty like newspapers. Egg decor all around, gives you the farm style feeling, liked it. Food was delicious, just a little too much cheese on omelettes. Chili relleno, crazy chicken, and strawberry cream cheese French toast all a must try. Debra ( Deborah?) our server was DELIGHTFUL & on point, never had to ask for refills, or extra napkins she was always right there when we needed her. She was very helpful in answering all of our questions.  Overall great visit, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Veronica serve us today and she is so nice and she is a good employee on this company"}
{"text":"Love this place! Egg Works at Anthem has become our family tradition of having breakfast together here each weekend. The service is always friendly and welcoming. P. K. is wonderful! He always remembers us and stops to talk to us. Where else can you get that kind of service?"}
{"text":"This may be a great place for breakfast, but I'd stay away from the Mexican food section of the menu.  The \"beef\" burrito  left me asking, literally, \"where's the beef?\" Not even the waiter could find any; it was stuffed with rice.  My friend saw Corn Chowder on the sign board in the lobby and ordered it.  They brought her Cream of Mushroom without so much as a word of explanation!  The worst part?  We still paid for both items!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times for breakfast and it's always delicious! Portions are large and the service is always outstanding. I had Kelli as my server today and she was delightful, will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Had the prime rib Benny, and the chile relleno. Both were amazing. Kathleen was a great server!"}
{"text":"Because there are so many items on the menu for breakfast and lunch its difficult to pick just one.  Portions are large at a reasonable price I can never finish my meal. Service here is consistently  awesome my favorite server is PK! He has the spirit of aloha and is genuinely friendly which shows through his excellent customer service. He is the best!"}
{"text":"Amazing! excellent service and great healthy clean food Donna did an amazing job helping us choosing our delicious meals I will come back!"}
{"text":"Love it here! We sat down and our server Donna came right away. Service was great and food came within 15 minutes. Service definitely makes breakfast dates, especially so early in the morning. Our server was very attentive and sweet. Country Benny was delicious as always. My boyfriend had the cheese enchilada ranchero and pretty much licked the plate clean!"}
{"text":"Passed by it on my way to buy some stuff off of Craigslist. I asked the seller if he liked the Egg Works down the street. Dude said he and his wife go there all the time, and they love it. Sold.  Went there, felt like I was back east at a breakfast joint. Will be bringing my parents there when they visit.  I got a breakfast burger, and was very pleased with it. I was alone so I sat at the counter in the back, got my own coffee carafe and was happy about it.  Just wish there was an Egg Works in the Centennial Hills area."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast. Our server PK is the best. Always fast and friendly, good food and great mimosas."}
{"text":"Great food    omelettes are huge so we split one...they do this at no extra charge...Donna was our server and was great!"}
{"text":"This is a must stop for breakfast.  Telly is great as a server.  She knew I was a new customer and help me make a solid choice.  Being from the south I know what good breakfast is.  This was a great breakfast.  I had the works omelette, it was perfect.  Sourdough toast and potatoes.  Wow.  The banana nut muffins was incredible.  5 stars. I know why they were voted 1 in Vegas.  Sit at the counter to watch a real show."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and Olivia was the best server! Very polite and attentive! She made my first experience great and I will definitely come back again when I visit Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the one on flamingo but noticed this one since I live near by. I waited a few months for it to open and finally opened this monday. Went to go visit tuesday and ordered my usual corned beef hash and spinach egg and it tasted just as good as the other one. The staff was very friendly, and the place was very clean. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quick service, and yummy food! Can't go wrong!  My sister ordered the portuguese sausage and eggs and was served the ENTIRE Portuguese sausage! It was huge!  I ordered an omelette with potatoes and was amazed that the potatoes were actually little pillows of goodness. They were so yummy! I would go back just for the potatoes!"}
{"text":"Ahhh... I would like to thank my Yelp Mobile app for helping me find this breakfast joint. Wandering around the outskirts of the Strip, I found Egg Works 2 just a few miles away from where I was. A minute after we sat down, our drink order was taken and then shortly after we were greeted by our especially chipper waitress, Dolly, I think her name was. I asked her for a recommendation on the menu, and I'm glad I took it. She even mentioned that they did half orders on most items on the menu.  They have a system set up to grab the staff's attention when you need something. You just flip an egg icon to reveal a yellow unhappy face. We never had to deal with that since everything was perfect. Our food came out FAST. The half order of the Chile Rellenos omelet was more than enough! It came with potatoes and a banana nut muffin. Everything was delicious. We even came back a second time during our visit to Las Vegas with my mother and brother in law! They thanked us for the recommendation."}
{"text":"Used to go here regularly to dine in or take out. Really enjoyed the option to substitute tofu for eggs. HOWEVER, the last two times I've called (over a six-month period), they've been out of tofu. Come on! Really? On weekends?! Very disappointing. Would have given a much higher rating (considered giving two stars, but initial experiences were good enough to make it three, but 2 1/2 would be appropriate at this point). The food's been great in the past -- when they've actually had what we want. Getting less and less likely we'll keep trying...."}
{"text":"\"Skyline Style\" Cincinnati chili was kind of close. Not too bad. Not dead on but close enough."}
{"text":"Tanya is awesome! We sat on the patio today because we had our Beagle. She brought out a milk bone and an actual dog dish with some water super awesome! Anyway the banana pancakes were delicious! I added strawberries on top... It was perfection!   Always great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is one of my favorite meals, and it seems like most of the diner-style breakfast establishments I try enjoy bringing misery to one of my favorite foods. Fresh ingredients and homemade goods are the key. Frozen spinach, brought-in pastries, eggs from a jug -- these are where nightmares are formed. Thankfully, I didn't encounter any of the above at Egg Works.  The omelets here are absolutely delicious. I got one with mashed potatoes inside -- what's not to love? I also tried the veggie omelet -- very good, too. Oh and I'm a fan of the home fries. Fresh food, enormous portions, and friendly service.  The only downsides were the speed of service -- the kitchen was swamped that day, so things were SLOWWW. Also, the orange juice is not fresh squeezed (but I appreciate that the waitress was honest when I asked if it is fresh squeezed)."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here  the stuff French  toast  was to die for the Works potatoes was awesome , my sever  Tracy never let my drink go below half , alway came back and ask if we were OK. Will definitely  come back."}
{"text":"Wonderfully crafted breakfast is the one thing you can expect here. The portions are huge and the flavor is great but they sometimes go a little heavy on the butter which doesn't complement the omelettes but overall I was very satisfied with both times I came to Egg Works.  I always sat at the counter and the waiting staff were super nice. They give the establishment a really homey feel.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Candace was energetic, friendly & was there if i needed something. Made sure i was satisfied, good job  no wi-fi, but its ok, we need to talk to eachother as humans"}
{"text":"Mariia, our amazing waitress, served my crazy family of 8 this morning! She was absolutely patient with us and got all orders right despite 8 people asking questions all at once and talking over each other! The food was amazing as well, I got the chicken enchilada omelette and a waffle with whip and strawberry on the side- super yummy- and gave me two teas without me having to ask since I couldn't make up my mind. But anyway, she accommodated us from the beginning to the very end. Always a delicious trip at Egg Works! :)"}
{"text":"Just happened to be passing through and found this place on Google. It had high reviews so figured we would try it. Wow!! Food was amazing. The portions are huge! The salsa had a good flavor as well as the potatoes. I had the breakfast burrito!! Definitely would have it again. Josh our server was great!! This place is a must try."}
{"text":"So glad we found this great little local breakfast joint.  The place was not very packed when we got there (early on a Friday), so service was fast.  The food was surprisingly good with insanely huge portions.  Our table ordered the kid's meal cheeseburger, denver omelette, Mexican omelette, the classic and corned beef hash.  The meals came with either toast or a yummy homemade banana nut muffin, and they give you a carafe of coffee on your table for refills.  The Works breakfast potatoes are salty as hell but everything else was excellent."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing breakfast at Egg Works. The food was delicious and the service was outstanding. Our table kept John moving with the requests and he delivered and them some. Thanks so much John we really appreciate the great service!"}
{"text":"Food took forever and when it finally came out it was the wrong order. So they take it and bring the right order, got raw, runny omelette.  We left after wasting an hour of our time. The manager offered to \"comp\" the meal we didn't eat."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in this location! We frequent the Flamingo location and have always been satisfied. We went on Tues afternoon and were seated immediately in the middle of the restaurant, this is significant because no one took our order for over 20 min, tho many people walked by us. With our egg flipped a bus boy finally came to see what we needed and then sent a server over. The server informed us that we were not in his station but he would help us. Our food came promptly after that. As we were finishing our meal the hostess went around to all the children giving them balloons, but of course skipped our 3 yo. He started pointing and saying balloon, the hostess heard him, looked at him and ignored him. So I got up with him to get a balloon, as she was about to get him one someone walked up to pay and she made us wait to take care of the man paying, then FINALLY got my son a balloon. Just unexcepatable service. We will never go back to this location!   As a side note: I ordered the tostada salad without the meat or sour cream, so it is essentially $10.25 for iceberg, cheese and olives. I asked for ranch on the side and was charged .75. Just another irritation, as I would think they could consider ranch a substitute for the chicken it comes with."}
{"text":"Good breakfast highlighted by the banana walnut muffin. Works potatoes are great (if a little salty). Sausage gravy was good and biscuits flakey. Large portions."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm at the dentist office.  What is the deal with the florescent lights.  Food seemed like left overs."}
{"text":"Was looking for a breakfast/lunch restaurant near the airport before my departure. Egg Works was perfect! Off the strip, excellent food, and large portions for a great value. The side of potatoes were the best! I even purchased the jar of the seasoning to take home. Our Server, JAMIE, was very friendly and helpful on assisting me making a choice with the many decisions on the menu. She knew I was short on time and was attentive with the service. Thank you Jamie! Will make sure to stop there whenever I go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Delish is all I can say!  I had the mashed potato omelet and it was simply mouth-watering.  An omelet stuffed with garlic mashed potatoes, bacon, and cheese.  It came with a side of breakfast potatoes and toast.  A ton of food for only $10.  We had to wait a little bit to be seated (but to me that just says how great it is that so many people want to eat there), we had excellent service and overall just a wonderful experience.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the waiter Mario was excellent!! I'll be back! Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good and reasonably priced. Our server donna was attentive and nice. We will eat here again"}
{"text":"I'm not an egg person mainly stick with pancakes and waffles. I was genuinely excited to see that they had other items like burgers and pizza. I ordered the margarita pizza and it was delicious. I didn't even pick off the tomatoes.  Kudos to the staff. From the host to the servers, they were exceptionally friendly.  I would recommend Egg Works to all of my friends."}
{"text":"Heard hash house a go go is a great spot... we went and will have to try it someday soon... however... it was crowded at the door so when we learned of the 1 hour wait someone suggested Eggworks off of W. Flamingo.   5 minutes away and 15 minutes later we were sat with a party of 8 adults.   There was just as big a crowd in a much smaller restaurant.   We pass our food around to sample soo heres my story...   Main reason though this gets a 5 is...  Cottage Cheese is the BEST EVER period. Whatever was on top of it melted in my mouth.  Food portions HUGE cost LOW (109.00 total with 8 big appetites) really impressive presentation for what is normally basic stuff.. hard to be creative with breakfast but they pull it off.   Banana Bread French Toast... bit more of a dessert however it was SOOO GOOD!   Potato Omelet original to me at least and we all secretly love starch on starch on starch on starch.......   and the hostess had some Barbarella like hair do and was fun and took pics with us all... just great time this AM....."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is sooooo much better than The Cracked Egg down the street. Usually this chain restaurant has a long wait, but being that this particular restaurant is so spacious, there hardly ever is a wait. Don't judge the crowdedness from the parking lot like I once did. I decided to go to The Cracked Egg and regretted it.   Their banana nut muffin is amazing!"}
{"text":"Eggs works is pretty cute with the newsprint menus and cute mugs.  We tried it out not wanting to have motel breakfast or some fast food joint and it was ok.  The portions were huge (seems to be a theme at most American restaurants) so if you want a huge breakfast, definitely go here.  Service is great."}
{"text":"First breakfast place in Vegas that I've seen that has rice on their breakfast menu. Great food. We ordered the loco moco and the stuffed French toast."}
{"text":"Egg Works is eggcellent!! Nicole our server was awesome and funny! You can't go wrong with any plate on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service.  Lela was our server and she was on top of it.  Used a Groupon and saved a few bucks!  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Our Favorite Place for Breakfast and they have the best banana muffin.  PK is the best WAiter, super friendly, outstanding service. PK you awesome!"}
{"text":"Very Busy too much nose & commotion  Food Just Ok Service Just OK a little rushed and snippy Won't Return    Larry H"}
{"text":"Just had a great breakfast with my family. The food was outstanding but the service was exceptional. Our waitress Roslin is the best server we have had when having breakfast at egg works. Thanks Roslin. Will ask for you next you are worth the wait."}
{"text":"Always fast fresh hot food. Eat here like once a week. Never any issues or concerns. Great staff and service very quick and effective. Would recommend to anyone looking for a grwat breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent French toast, server Veronica was quick and attentive. Works potatoes are great as well."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, large portions and friendly service. Ask for the senior discount."}
{"text":"Amy provided my girlfriend and I great service this morning before we drove back home from Vegas. We had the Vegetarian Skillet which was so amazing and the Banana Bread French Toast which was pretty good. She made sure we had everything we needed and brought us extra salsa and hot sauces with our food. Our check arrived quickly and she even got us water to go. Thanks for the great breakfast. I hope you win the trip to Disneyland. :)"}
{"text":"This review is for the Egg Works (EW) restaurant that opened about a year ago at 10839 S. Eastern, Henderson, NV. Their hours are goofy but that is their shtick. They are conveniently located and usually not too crowded at the times I chose to dine there. My review is based on at least 6 visits over the past few months. Why so few visits? Read on...  The restaurant was converted from the old Bonefish Grill that opened and closed without much fanfare a few years ago. EW converted the interior to their open, bright and somewhat boring style that is reminiscent of a diner with green seats, small tables, painted murals and a motif that suggests the inside (or outside?) of a barn. That motif is apropos given the signature food served by this restaurant is the egg. The facility is generally clean though I have found crumbs on the chairs and benches as well as occasional sticky spots on the tables. The wait staff is friendly, professional and efficient.  My gripe is with food preparation. For the sake of this review, my order consisted of eggs, bacon, either a waffle or pancakes, and a drink. In six visits, the eggs have arrived correctly prepared from the kitchen only once; the bacon, three times; and the waffle or pancakes, twice. Believe it or not, I've had to request a new drink twice! For a restaurant that primarily serves breakfast, this is ... well ... amazingly disappointing. They usually delivered the eggs with runny whites (YUCK!) despite my request for \"over medium\" or \"over well\". The bacon was rarely cooked crisp. The flavorful waffles have been so crunchy as to be nearly burnt and the pancakes were so gummy as to be inedible (the fake maple syrup was only passable). The portion size, for the albeit pricey menu item, was average -- $12 for two eggs, three thin strips of bacon, 1 waffle (or 2 pancakes) and a drink. There was no garnish. Admittedly, other dishes have larger portion sizes along with somewhat higher prices. Other menu items offer breakfast potatoes (I avoid these because they are severely over-spiced) or a banana muffin (I think it is a little too sweet).  They do have one redeeming quality though: they stand behind their product. While I don't like to complain about the food I'm served -- and I rarely return anything -- if they notice I've left my meal over, they will offer to make a new one or adjust my check. Kudos to them for that but I really wish they would train their cooks to do a better job and have someone double check that the meal is prepared correctly before it leaves the kitchen (as the server isn't always the one who brings the food out).  I wish I could write that I liked EW more.  2 stars for the food plus 1 star for their pride."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. We went there based on yelp reviews, and we were so happy with our first visit that we visited again the next day.  The food is great, especially the potatoes made in hot sauce...all servers are very helpful.  Robert was our server - very friendly, very attentive...made both our visits very pleasant."}
{"text":"Service is great, food portions are good, very busy place.  The potatoes are good but sometimes it is over seasoned and quite salty on my last visit.  I like the staff.  This is one of my go to place for breakfast.  PK is great and provided very attentive service.  I am working down the menu trying to order different things."}
{"text":"Everything was so fast and yummy!! Jacqueline did a great job with a wonderful warm touch"}
{"text":"Two amazing discoveries: Best Banana Nut Muffin ever AND our waitress DONNA!!!  Great family \"Diner\""}
{"text":"Pk is the best server! Attentive and brings the aloha spirit to the ninth island. The food was egg-cellent. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Egg works is the spot for my wife and I to enjoy a traditional breakfast. We always get great service, but today was outstanding thanks our awesome server Marc. We look forward to coming back next and see Marc once again with his happy face. Cheers! He's a great asset to the egg work team. Keep smiling (the wife Jo)"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a breakfast place in awhile, and I'm glad I came here!  Came in hungry and thirsty, ordered a Bloody Mary and Egg White Veggie omelette. Perfect for a pre pool day fuel. Awesome drink and food.  Heather thank you for being attentive and giving me your recommendations! You were awesome on the H20 refills, and asking if I needed anything. Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Prime rib eggs benedict is delish! You'll need a while to review the menu there's so many good choices."}
{"text":"One of a kind, go to breakfast/ lunch spot! Food is always spot on with huge portions at a great price (you can ask for half orders) & free banana muffin with Check in! Customer service is superb, Taylor really took care of us! I don't understand other reviewers complaints, eat at home!"}
{"text":"Robert was our waiter. AWESOME! Great personality. We have been here many times for breakfast. Great Food! This is one of our favorite breakfast places."}
{"text":"The food was very good I ordered pancakes, scrambled eggs, and sausage links. The food was very big portions and the waitress was very nice. She made our breakfast more enjoyable and we will be coming again."}
{"text":"Whoa!  Great service and awesome food...always a little wait to get in, but they move people along very quickly...The Banana muffins are very special...and so is everything else.  The staff works very hard to take care of you.  If something is not quite right..just speak up and they will fix it immediately...."}
{"text":"Great food. Best service ever from Donna!    I don't normally like Banana Nut Muffins, but gave them a try since Donna brought us one. They were delish!"}
{"text":"Egg Works never disappoints. The food is always fresh and fast and delicious. I personally don't care for the seasoning they use on their potatoes, but that's easily remedied by asking them to omit the seasoning. Hellena was our waitress and she didn't miss a beat!  She was verry attentive and all smiles even though it was obvious she was swamped. If you've never been, it's a must."}
{"text":"Had lunch here...  basically, huge, shareable portions of comfort food done well (with the exception of their sticky rice, which is more like a pasty mush)."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots in Vegas. They have island food options. Their potatoes are one of the best!"}
{"text":"I love egg works!! :) This place is my favorite breakfast place in the world!! Today I am having a works beni with scrambled eggs &  breakfast potatoes. Being a vegetarian I love there fresh fruit plate with cottage cheese. The staff is always super friendly and very accommodating. I love taking my dates here also they have such a great menu! 5stars for egg works!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous find. I followed other reviewers and got the stuffed cream cheese strawberry French toast. It was a huge portion and so delicious! I also love they left the coffee pot on the table so I didn't have to wait for a refill."}
{"text":"Breakfast all day!  I love the Sundance Omelette, and Candice did a great job for us.  I travel here from Salt Lake and have to eat here when I am in town.  Menu has several different items, service is good, and food comes out quick.  Price is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Today at Flamingo was our first time to any of the Egg Works locations.  Blackened Prime Rib Benny and the chicken club sandwich and Works Chili all rocked.  So did our great server Amy.  We will be back. The muffin is a great starter or dessert!  No one left hungry!"}
{"text":"Egg works isn't my go to restaurant for breakfast but they do have great customer service everything I go there. I love love LOVEEEEEE their banana nut muffins. Every time I go, I always have to get it. I find a entree that comes with banana nut muffin so I can get some banana nut muffin. LOL! Their muffins are really moist which probably means A LOT of butter so if you're on a diet BEWARE. These little devils are delicious!!! I would say not to order the simple dishes. I was trying to eat a little healthier the other day.. so I went with a simple eggs, turkey sausage and asked for hash browns. I love hash browns so I was pretty disappointment in my meal this time. I got two hash browns with two eggs and two turkey sausage patties. First off, the hash browns looked like they were from McDonald's and I wasn't even sure if the turkey sausages were actually made out of turkey. I guess that's the risk you take when you go out to eat though. I expect more from Egg Works I guess you can say. Another sad thing is my friend thought the hash browns at McDonald's were better! Hahah which I thought was a little funny but in a way it made me hate my meal a little more. The work potatoes taste a little hollow too and you can tell they're from the freezer. Each mean is around $10-$15 I would say. If I actually got fresh food, I wouldn't mind paying 10 bucks for it (Just saying).   They have a bunch of other great options but not for if you're trying to eat healthy and out with your friends. At least I haven't found any I guess.   I love their stuffed french toast and their waffles with ham and eggs (drools). They have a bunch of other options as well on their cool newspaper menu.   I say the customer service is amazing because one time we waited for I would say a little over 20 minutes. The waiter for our table gave our party each a free muffin - there were four people at my table. We were pretty happy campers. I mean.. a little after he gave us those muffins, we got our food. I even remember the manger getting me water all the time. I must say that water is really what I use to determine if a place has good customer service because I drink A LOT of water.   The parking isn't too bad since you can usually go on the other side of 7-11 and park. It gets really packed over the weekend but during the week you can find a spot behind the restaurant.  Also if it is over the weekend expect to wait a good 20 minutes or so."}
{"text":"I was just looking for a nice spot to have a good breakfast while visiting LV. I noticed the good yelp reviews and decided to give it a try even tho it was in the opposite direction than the rest of my day. It was well worth going out of my way. Donna did a great job, was very friendly, pleasant and I was attend to with efficiency. Thank you Egg Works and Donna for an extremely pleasant breakfast experience!"}
{"text":"Egg Works food is really good.  I take my 2 year old grandson regularly to get blueberry mouse pancakes and he loves it.  Today we went and waited 10 minutes to get waited on.  The restaurant was not busy and with a 2 year old who is hungry and wants his milk and pancakes it isn't fun to wait.   It was very frustrating I had to stand up and wait until someone was walking around and ask for help to get our drinks and take our order.  Because my grandson is so young I always over tip usually 25% of the bill because of the mess that he can make.  Sad experience today."}
{"text":"The banana nut muffins are homemade and wonderful. Not much gets me to rate a place, but when I try how delicious these muffins are and they say they'll throw another in if I rate it, then I had to pull out my phone right then and there. Best muffins I've ever had! (And I'm not just saying that)"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation because we usually go to the typical buffet on the strip or cheap buffet since were not from here we usually don't know where to go so we ended up here for breakfast before we leave awesome menu crazy selections took us awhile to figure out what we wanted i had with me 3 girls, wife, and mother in law but we were able to order no matter what we ordered we were not disappointed will be coming back big portions for what we pay (ORDER THE BANANA NUT MUFFIN) and i don't usually eat banana nut muffin but somehow i don't know what's inside is moist not dry soft all the way through we even ordered 2 more loafs on our way out. what we ordered 2 skillets, kids had fruit and eggs, wife got avocado something mother in law shared with wife so whatever it was it was good."}
{"text":"The menu is insane, in a good way. Great coffee and three pig omelet. Be sure to arrive hungry because the portions are big. The service was great. What a great find!"}
{"text":"Yummy delicious banana nut muffin..warm and moist. I'm from the islands so can you imagine my excitement when I saw that they had island style dishes. Oh yes, I ordered the portuguese sausage, eggs and rice. Lol.  My boyfriend ordered a fruit parfait and scrambled egg whites. He was happy when the order came because the parfait was a fairly large size and the egg whites tasted delicious.  We came on a Saturday morning and it was busy..but our initial reaction was \"this is a good sign\"!"}
{"text":"We set out early on a Saturday morning. Our server was Kat. Right from the start she was On It with her customer service. Took our drink order, brought them fast and correct. Took the order. It came out correct. She checked on us asked if we needed anything (best part is she didn't ask when our mouths were full) so we could answer her. She took the time to look and see if our glasses were getting empty and automatically brought refills. I witnessed her pick up other servers tables that were slacking off. She was moving all time. Kat was one of few and far between servers in the service industry. Kat was excellent! Food was excellent. Better than eating at any strip joint. Keep up the good work Egg Works!!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. Excellent service, great and unique choices. Away from the strip and great place to start your day!"}
{"text":"Food and Service is always great... Kids enjoy the kids menu.  Variety of different games and news piping in on the tv's... A little bit of happiness for the entire family... Food is cooked to order.  Our go to local breakfast place..."}
{"text":"Heather is our server and she's best! gotta love 'em banana muffins! food was xcellent!"}
{"text":"Their prices are very reasonable in my opinion because they give you large portions. I've only been to this location twice (2nd time was today), and I have to say that while the food is good, their customer service is lacking. We were seated right away since it was only 2 people, and we got our drinks fast, but the waitress did not bother to take our meal orders until maybe 15-20 min later. and the waitress who actually took our order was not the one who gave us our drinks. She was shocked that no one had taken our order and apologized. I don't care how busy you are. I just think to wait 20 minutes just to order is a little ridiculous. On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate their food a 7. I'm surprised that a restaurant who serves eggs doesn't have healthier options listed on the menu. You can substitute the potatoes for fruit and the muffin/toast is optional. I think this should be listed on the menu. All the omelets have cheese on them. So you need to say no cheese if you don't want it. No big deal. I just think it's not the most health-conscious menu. I also didn't see anything about egg whites on there. You just have to ask for that. The inside is not nice at all. It looks like the inside of a McDonald's. It's a little loud in there too.   Overall, if you want to go to a cheap place and don't mind waiting a long time for your order to be taken, then you should go here. You'll get large portions and the prices are good.  However, if you're looking for quality, a nice atmosphere, and a staff that comes by your table to see how you're doing (general customer service), I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Good and service always on point. Banana nut muffins are D E licious . Maryann was our care taker today she took REAL good care of us. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Had a mashed potato omelette and my wife had a western omelette. Both were great and the waitress Donna was top notch and gave first class service!!"}
{"text":"Had Breakfast. Great meal and great service from Tanya.  The meal was prepared fresh and the overall atmosphere was very nice as well."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in Vegas, AND you have a slight hang-over AND you're in a rush to fill your stomach with SOMETHING don't come here. Keep your vegas strip lovin butt away from this local gem. If, however, you want the best eggs in Vegas served with the genuine diner service at the speed of light you've found your place."}
{"text":"What a great first experience! The wait was less than 10 mins, the food was great and the service was exceptional! Glad I gave them a try and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is good portion and the banana nut muffin is amazing."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The service is even better. Delicious bloody Marys and mimosas, too. An absolute must try. You will be hooked!!"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars hands down. It was our first time here. Welcomed with a smile. Our waiter was Eden and he was so nice and offered suggestions. He was very honest too. I asked what his favorite thing on the menu is and he said sundance special or bacon avocado omelet. I got the sundance and added avocado to it and boy let me tell you.... OFF THE CHAIN!!!! Eden was so friendly and patient. They're salsa is delicious too. They care that your food is perfect too. If it's not right they take it back and make it perfect. Eggs any way you can imagine. They hold true to they're slogan... EGGS-ACTLY WHAT YOU WANT!!!! I'll definitely be coming back my next time in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Having arrived late in the day, I was still seated, the staff was polite and friendly. I was served by Tracy, she got my order correct. I ordered a bacon and onion skillet, eggs over easy, sourdough toast, and a side order of strawberry yogurt. The eggs were cooked to what I ordered, the skillet was great, although slightly greasy, but I was hungry and I enjoyed it. The yogurt was alright, but it's yogurt not much you can do to it without going crazy, but as good as you can get at the store."}
{"text":"Food is great and the service is amazing! Our server Mariyah was so kind and attentive :) really recommend her and this place. Would come again ;)"}
{"text":"First timer and won't be the last!  I had the Veggie Benny, terrific.  And not to mention the service was eggcellent!  Tonya was or server and just a delight!  We will be back soon!           Thanks Egg Works indeed.  OH, almost forgot, the best \"free\" banana nut muffin ever!"}
{"text":"We love egg works! Donna was our server and she was awesome! She was on top of all of her tables and took care of us quickly."}
{"text":"Good food. Decent prices. EXCELLENT SERVICE. When you flip the egg so a sad face, anyone working who is available comes to see what you need. Brilliant idea. Lived our waitress Melissa!"}
{"text":"A very nice mom and pa eatery.  Generous portions, good quality.  Mosit banana nut muffin, and fresh ingredients in the egg white veggie omelette.  Our server Candice, was very friendly and attentive.  Fast service too.  Would definitely visit again.  Hope Candice wins the trip to Disneyland!"}
{"text":"Today I decided to grub at Egg Works before the start of my work shift. I really couldn't decide what I wanted on the menu partially because, everything on the menu was \"calling me\" and I had so much time to get to work. All of a sudden, I very kind waitress by the name of Tamara , assisted me with making a delicious choice. I landed on the steak and cheese melt and it was terrific !! My main point is, Tamara was very at tentative to me and a true professional. I'd recommend this service to anyone . Tee"}
{"text":"Great food, and excellent service (Thanks, Tamara!). Despite the name, the best thing we got was the banana nut French toast. I will say, though, that the portion sizes are huge."}
{"text":"Thanks for a great brunch, Donna. The veggie crepe and banana nut muffin were yum!  My husband had the works crepe and he said it was really good."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on Saturday. There was 3 of us and the wait was approx 15. Not too bad for a Saturday morning, kinda of expected.  Service was fairly quick, they were obv trying to turnover as many tables as possible, but we didn't feel rushed  The food was good. I order the sunrise mountain (open croissant with eggs, sausage and cheese on top), lady got the waffles and her friend got the French toast.   The girls liked tier meals although the waffles were a bit too doughy. every special requests tended to, sizeable portions.   The sunrise mountain was pretty good,  generous portion. It was served in a cast iron dish with the croissant covering the bottom and the eggs, sausage, and cheese melted over the top. It was pretty heavy and there was a lot of cheese on it and I will probably ask for less next time.  All in all, food was good and service was fair. Will have to go back and try some other dishes and not during a crazy busy time."}
{"text":"Amazing food, with amazing service, at an affordable price! We take our family here once a week for breakfast! Love this place"}
{"text":"Came here for veterans day and they didn't offer anything for veterans. ...second they were very busy our server Hellen took our order started out friendly she did not deliver our food a second server did and they didn't bring out my daughter's food she said she would be right back with it and never returned after a good 8 minutes our server returned and looked disgusted that my daughter was still waiting she returned shortly with the missing plate ....third our server never brang our muffins which I love so we  turned our egg to yellow as they say to do for assistance and waited 20 minutes for our server   Hellen to acknowledge us but never made eye contact with us once she dropped off our check 5 minutes after delivering our food So fourth a busses named Ramon marched to our table like he was on a mission and helped us and checked in us after also......so much for great service....and thank you Ramon"}
{"text":"Donna was awesome... The skillets never disappoint. Love Egg Works for some Sunday morning breakfast #yum"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly although they did tell me repeatedly that I wasn't going to get my change back if my total is less than the groupon we were using... lol thank you but I wasn't expecting any change. I'm posting this review because the whole wheat waffle was absolutely terrible and hopefully someone who was thinking about that option see this before hand :) think.. tasteless cardboard. . And turkey bacon wasn't all that grand either. Everything else tho!! Was great :)"}
{"text":"This place is excellent or should I  say egg-excellent. Our server Alex was great, friendly, personable, professional. We come here as often as we can!!! Hope Alex gets to go to Disney. I am a huge Disney fan... Wish I could go too!!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was very nice! And the food was great, especially after the gluttony that was the Vegas buffets! I got a mashed potato omelet, but I didn't want to smother it in cheddar and jack cheese, so I asked for feta instead. Great choice! But the thing that got me, that got the other Yelpers as well, was the banana nut muffin...Dear God, the muffin...I liked it better than the banana nut muffin at the California Grill in Whittier, CA. Go there and have delicious food! Definitely having it again when I'm in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here at Egg Works and I gotta say that I loved it! I got the Works skillet and it was so amazing. Thank you to our server Maryann for the wonderful service!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST breakfast, and great service. Ethan was our waiter and he was super nice and very speedy! The best part though, is the food. I ordered the corned beef hash. It was the best I've ever had. It came with breakfast potatoes, eggs and toast/muffin. The banana nut muffin was worth going back for, just on its own. My hubby ordered the loco moco. The burger was cooked perfectly, the gravy was great, and it came with all the same sides as the corned beef hash. He can't go on enough about it. We also ordered a stack of original pancakes, and they were amazing as well. It was more than enough food! We will definitely be returning! I suggest everyone try this place out at least once."}
{"text":"My review of yesterday's breakfast comes with bias because we eat here all the time for breakfast.  But this is my first review.  We usually stick to our favorite dishes and don't deviate too often.  When the dish is always good, no need to change.  I always get the bacon, avocado omelet in the small portion (a bit cheaper but you have to ask for it).  My husband always gets the fiesta skillet with chorizo, no eggs.  This comes in a half-size too for reduced calories and price.  The banana nut muffin is the best!  Forget toast, you want the muffin!  We use coupons a lot here which is a nice feature for locals.  The breakfast potatoes are seasoned with their special flavor.  I wish they had home style hash browns, but they don't.  All in all, we always return and we always leave happy.  Oh yeah, and they leave the coffee carafe on your table for unlimited never-need-a server access!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to have breakfast. (We haven't tried them at lunchtime yet...) The food is delicious and  they have a wide selection. It is hard to choose!  What's also a cute idea is that they have a dog-friendly patio where your doggie can sit with you. We don't have a dog, but we love to see dog owners enjoy breakfast time with their cute pets.   Their bottomless, delicious hot coffee is also just perfect for me in the morning! My kids love to come here too. Their favorites are the French toast & the Mouse-shaped pancake. Service is courteous and quick, although today they did forget my banana nut muffin and one of our side toasts (it's okay these things happen sometimes )... but we didn't realize it until after we left... because truthfully our tummies were stuffed silly lol!  I can definitely recommend the charming Summerlin location. If you go early, there's no wait-time to get seated. They are open from 6am to 3pm."}
{"text":"above avg breakfast, but the decor and atmosphere of a law office."}
{"text":"Great value for the price. Food came out quick and the server Jacqueline was super pleasant"}
{"text":"Great service and great food!  The servers are accommodating and friendly and attentive. 5 stars. Especially the girl with the dark glasses."}
{"text":"Plenty of choices for breakfast. Stuffed French toast and Las Vegas omelette were delicious with plenty to take home. Our server Perry was  helpful,courteous and very patient. We will be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic service from Lisa and definitely recommend the breakfast skillets! :-) :-) can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints with its great service and amazing food. Our server Victoria was amazing and so sweet.  I will definitely be coming back!:)"}
{"text":"Last time I ordered for pick up they forgot my muffin. Now I ordered waffles With strawberries then my mom picked up my order when she got home they forgot my strawberries. I guess I'll drive a little further for cracked egg from now on."}
{"text":"I am a regular at the egg works in Anthem.  Its always good food and great service.  PK was our server most recently.  He is personable, attentive and a really good server. Service was top notch."}
{"text":"The service is amazing, considering we had an 11 people party and the place was full they gave us a table in less then five minutes. The staff is polite and also gave us a little tip on the best dishes. The food is amazing (especially the potatoes). Would recommend!"}

{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in \"Vegas\". This one is close to home. The veggie skillet is enough to share with a friend. I never miss out on the banana nut muffin even though I try not to eat flour much. The staff is very friendly and always makes us feel like friends. Thanks for opening up nearby."}
{"text":"FYI, my husband and I had breakfast there this morning.  In case you're interested, we want you to know why we will NOT be returning.  We found the tables & chairs very uncomfortable.  The tables are so small that when the meal comes, you have to do a lot of juggling around to make room for the rest of the stuff that you already have on the tables.  A few more inches would have been a much better design plus the chairs are very uncomfortable.  The place has no soundproofing and is very, very loud.  It reminded us of a cafeteria much like a school.  We kept thinking we were in a factory--not a pleasant atmosphere at all.  We feel it is disgusting that whoever designed this place all they had in mind was how many people we can fit no matter how uncomfortable they may be.    Atmosphere and surroundings are just as important to us as the food when we dine at a restaurant.  Even though the food was good and the staff was very attentive, which did please us, I noticed on our receipt, it did not have a website to let you know where you could comment on your visit."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love Egg Works!  We most often go to Egg Works on Eastern Ave. and have always had a great experience.  The orders are received quickly and the portions are huge.  For the price, it's an awesome bargain.  Egg Works has always exceeded our expectations.  The servers are always very pleasant, and more often, you can find a server with a great sense of humor.    Ya know what? They are so good... We're going to visit them today!  KUDOS to our favorite breakfast/brunch/lunch joint!!!  :)"}
{"text":"I tend to go back and forth between the Sunset location and the Rainbow/215 location but I have to say that the Sunset location is probably my favorite! I typically go on Sundays and there always seems to be seats at the bar or a very low wait time for seating. The food is always amazing, hot, cooked to order, fresh! The last few times I've gone to the Sunset location and had a seat at the bar and are served by Shantel. This girl is awesome, she's always so friendly and not afraid to start up a quick conversation. Usually I request pineapple with my meal instead of the potatoes and now she ALWAYS has that delicious chili lime seasoning placed on the counter without a hesitation!  Service like hers will definitely keep me coming back and it doesn't hurt that the food is DELICIOUS!  Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Five of us went to lunch at the location on Eastern.  They weren't very busy, yet it took quite a while for the food to come out.  I liked their fries and onion rings.  I ordered a club ranch wrap without tomatoes.  It was a lot of food but I didn't care much for the cheese or the ranch dressing, too runny and sour.  Two members of my party ordered the BLTs and we're happy.  The BLTs had a ton of bacon on them.  Another member of our party had the pancakes and we both thought they tasted more like KFC biscuits than pancakes.  Lastly, someone had the cheeseburger and they thought it was awful.  They said it tasted like they put chopped onions and oatmeal or some other type of filler in it.  They may serve up a mean egg breakfast, but I don't think I'll be going back to find out."}

{"text":"Loved the food here! And I love the hot sauce here as well. My family and I usually come here every Sunday morning its a great family place with a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Friendly team, great food! Nice option to order half-size entrees if you're not hungry enough for a  four egg omelette or if you want to try more than one thing. We sat outside on the pet friendly patio."}
{"text":"Sadly today this location FAILED. To be clear they comp'd the meal, yet this major mess up must be called out because it is inconsistent with the normal good job Egg Works has done every other time.  After waiting 45 minutes for food and seeing others seated after us being served, one of two meals showed up. It was wrong, having cheese on it. With a tight timeline the person ate it.  On the second me the waitress apologized that it was not started. To be clear the waitress, Rea, was awesome. She placed my special order correctly, yet the kitchen just FAILED to do their job. I said to cancel the meal because we had no time to wait.  The manager Koko was great as well apologizing numerous times. The food showed up while she was there and it was wrong. The kitchen could not read the freaking slip!!!! The manager stated the main chef was just arriving at 10:00 am on a Sunday morning abd would handle it.  It is obvious from the running around in the kitchen that this crew needs retraining or continous supervision. Better yet how about the main chef get in at a reasonable time for such a busy Sunday am crowd.  I will give them another try in the future, but they must fix this crew."}
{"text":"Love coming to egg works. They're omelets are amazing, muffins are fresh and the potatoes you'll always be craving! Amy was an amazing server. Very attentive and made sure we were well taken care of. I recommend egg works to everyone!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Hawaii, this was our first stop right after getting off the airplane.    I ordered the Spinach Benny.  It came in a gratin dish and was loaded with hollandaise sauce unlike the ones I've had in Hawaii.  Eggs poached correctly.  I felt less guilty about eating all that hollandaise because the spinach made it a healthy meal.  The Works potatoes, great taste but I'm not sure what was in it, almost tastes like Old Bay.  Saw that they sell it at the cashier stand.  Should have bought one, oh well, next time.  The service was quick and going in on Monday morning, we were seated immediately.  In and out just how breakfast should be."}
{"text":"Well, we decided to give this place one more try to redeem themselves. Glad we did, the service was a bit slow, but the food was SOOO WORTH THE WAIT...excellent Spanish Cobb Salad and they made the chicken just the way i wanted it customized. Everything was awesome!! So glad we tried it again, with the COMP GC they gave us to make up for the last time/1st time we visited.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Breakfast eaters, look to other reviews because someone's Best Burgers of Las Vegas list pointed the way here, specifying the cheeseburger with Cincy chili, and that's the find. The burger itself is fine, indifferent, no worse than a thousand others of its ilk. But the chili. These folks get the Cincinnati approach. Tweaked with unsweetened chocolate and a bit of cinnamon (but replete with more standard fare like cumin, paprika, garlic and tomato sauce) it's a regional style that if you suspend any constitutionally held ideas of what chili ought to be, is really quite delightful. In Ohio (and across the river in Kentucky) you can have it 3-Way, 4-Way or 5-Way with spaghetti and the chili being the one and two base and finely grated Cheddar, onions and beans being three through five, depending on how you like it. Works the same here at Egg Works. This stuff is hard to come by out west, (a few years ago some guy tried to open a Skyline imitation buried in a shopfront hole in the wall on Van Nuys Blvd and folded in flash) and if you're curious to open your mind and palate to chili adventures, this is way easier than flying into CVG. That said, here's a caution for all cases: don't go anywhere expecting the absolutely uncontested best thing you've ever eaten. Take it for what it is, simple, enjoyable and somewhat different from what you're probably used to and your experience (and life) will be just a tiny bit more pleasant. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I heard about this place while researching the best places to go for breakfast in Vegas on Yelp, of course. =D Checked out the website and was impressed that it was on one of Rachel Ray's finds on the Food Network. Looking at the menu made me hungry so my husband and I decided to check it out the next day.  It was quite busy when we got there around 9:30 am. Plenty of tables and flat screen tvs...We were immediately seated. I was fascinated with the newspaper-printed menu. Quite unusual. Definitely stood out.  I ordered the Waffle Works with bananas, eggs and bacon. My husband ordered the Biscuits and Gravy. When our orders arrived the first thing we noticed was that the portions were HUGE! To us, one plate was plenty for two.  I was a  bit disappointed with my order. Nothing really impressed me besides the portion. My waffles were overcooked. The eggs didn't have enough seasoning and tasted rubbery. The bacon was okay.  My husband said that his biscuits were a bit hard to fork through. But, he enjoyed the Works potatoes. Overall our first experience at Egg Works was (sorry to say): Eh.  The Standouts: Hearty portions, attentive service, unique menu.  Would we come back? Yes. Willing to give it another visit. Next time we'll share a plate and try out the banana nut muffin."}
{"text":"Devine! What a find in this city of a million to one. I had the country Benny which was the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had. The potato side was so delectable I nearly teared up with happiness. My taste buds were given Such a treat my butt on the other hand will be running around the lake daily so I can indulge in this spectacular restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Highly recommended for anyone looking for and egg breakfast prepared the way you like it. Try the muffins for an extra treat."}
{"text":"Friendly place. Our server was awesome (Heidi). They have big portions! Had homemade corned beef hash which came with eggs, the works potatoes, fruit (pineapple + melon) and a banana nut muffin. Good breakfast spot."}
{"text":"My gf and I  come here all the time and ask for Nicole's section. She is the best! Great smile, fast service..food is always hot and my ice tea glass is never empty! Reason why we come to this Egg Works."}
{"text":"As usual the food was great,  the price was good and the service was excellent - thanks Veronica!  I will be back."}
{"text":"A great place to have breakfast. A gem of a place to share with friends and family from out of town, where a \"go to\" breakfast joint is hard to find. They all have been thoroughly impressed and surprised that Vegas has more than gaming and the Strip to offer. The country fries are extremely tasty. The muffins are on par with Bouchon at the Venetian. The country gravy is just perfect as country gravy can get.   Room for improvement would be: 1. Have the servers take the bill and payment for processing instead of leaving it to the patron to go all the way to the front of the entrance there there is usually a line of people trying to pay. For those of us who are busy, having a morning breakfast may be the only time we spend with the family until dinner. Therefore, it takes away from the quality family time at the table for one of us to  have to do what most servers at other restaurants already do. For those who are busy schedules and are trying to squeeze every minute we can with the family, it feels like if we were asked to go pick up our order from the kitchen when our number is called. It is annoying, especially when the food is as good as it is."}
{"text":"Food was always good every time I come down to visit. Our server amanda was very nice and made sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"I love eating at Egg and I, but the portion sizes are getting smaller, there is no freash fruit served on the plates anymore...  seems like they are downsizing because of the economy a bit too.  i want to keep eating there, but need to find coupons to keep doing it, very expensive breakfast to eat there every weekend.... I have seen a few buy one and get one (up to $8) free, but I am one person, so  don't need two entrees and this coupon doesn't help me.   Anyone know where I can get Egg Works or Egg and I coupons for I entree?"}
{"text":"Is it me, or has the portion sizes shrank???  The past 6 times I have eaten here I have noticed the Brad's Special portion size getting smaller.  It now looks like a 1/2 order....   Very disappointing.  I didn't mind paying the higher prices for the better quality and the larger portion sizes, but now I have to think about eating there......   Very sad.  Wish someone would look at this and fix the problem......  Sad Customer"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here today. The food was great. Jennifer, our server, was very attentive. She kept us inform in the progress of our food.  She thought of what we needed before we asked. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Always great food and the best customer service. I'm so happy they opened up down the street from where I live. My husband and I go there almost once a week. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful, service was excellent,  ask for Donna her service is amazing and she's a great person!"}
{"text":"Awesome service. I was surprised to see one of the managers Chris on the floor helping out! He was really nice and I was really impressed with the his outstanding customer service.  I will be telling everyone about our first time visit and will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Rea, thank you for the great service, recommendations and conversation. I loved the banana muffin."}
{"text":"Pretty ok breakfast. Would eat again. No bran though, that kinda sucked. Super good muffins."}
{"text":"Food is great! The seasoning on their potatoes was delicious, service was very quick, it was nice that they also had wifi! Their banana nut muffins were amazing! I would definitely eat here again. Also, if you give a review, you get a banana nut muffin! Amazing! 10/10!"}
{"text":"A other great breakfast!! And our server Danielle was the best. Thanks guys. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Three of us had breakfast on Tuesday. Donna gave us excellent service. She seemed to be one step ahead of our needs. The food was delicious. We can always count on consistent and delicious food at Egg Works."}
{"text":"I have gone here twice in the last week already, and although they are always busy, they try their beat to seat you right away. Both times that I have went, the wait was no longer than ten minutes. Their banana but muffin is hands down the best muffin ever. So is their country fried chicken skillet, waffles, pancakes, & island plates. My husband and I are trying to make this our Monday morning regular place to go to till the day we grow old together. Love this place and their delicious breakfast/brunch foods."}
{"text":"First visit from Kentucky. Loved the food and service! Whatta menu. Our waiter Judd was wonderful. Very informed and helpful. Will be back asap!"}
{"text":"This morning me and my family had breakfast. Kathleen was my waitress and she was awesome!!! She has made my day. I just wanted to say thanks"}
{"text":"My family and I always enjoy going to egg works. Our server today was Donna and she was AMAZING! So attentive and friendly. Food is always delicious, definitely recommend the stuffed french toast!!"}
{"text":"By far - hands down, the best breakfast place yet.... I work graveyard so finding a place to spend time for dining with family is key for me and let me just say that this place is perfect....ambiance is really good, food is great, serving is huge, there is some wait time though (that's how it always is when the food is great) but it is a reasonable wait time - not even 30 minutes or hours.  I discovered this place after i was given a gift cert by a friend and I have been going here ever since.... crepes are great - that's what i always order!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent bananna nut muffin with chili omlette and works potatoes and our server named Kaitlin was delightful."}
{"text":"We had a nice and tasty Breakfast. Donna was an excellent waitress. We ?l come back. I really recommend the Breakdfast burrito. We are sure donna will win the Trip to Disneyland - have fun!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple time and always amazing food and service. Our server Donna  was the sweetest ever. Thank you again!"}
{"text":"We come here all the time and I love it. Donna gave us some great service  today. The food is amazing and the staff here are always very courteous. Anytime I have family come into town, I always bring them here. The weekends are very busy. Usually a 15 to 20 minute wait for a table, depending on the size of your party. But they are definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"I am only \"giving\" 2 stars because of the very good service! BUT, the cinamon french toast had no flavor.. The bananna french toast was cold. The sausage was cold and was sitting in a \"puddle\" of grease! I will  not be returning to this \"BEST OF LAS VEGAS\" establishment!"}
{"text":"Always in search for good eats, I like to give credit where credit is due. Egg Works is one of those places. Their banana nut muffin to start your experience is awesome! Takes me back to a place when momma use to make banana bread. Oh right, the restaurant....could this be true? We were sited within 3 minutes of walking in on an early Saturday morning! What!!! When you walk in, you are taken back to maybe when you were a kid and your parents sent you to summer camps. It almost has a dining hall atmosphere with the exception of an arcade and tvs!   Vettles - the potatoes are similar to the ones you find at Cracked Egg. Actually it's almost exactly like the Cracked Egg. Glad I live close to both of them! Their Greek Scramble was incredible, I don't mind that my tongue goes numb eating the spinach but the artichoke, chicken, feta make it that much better.  As a breakfast fan, I highly recommend this place. We had to test the service by flipping the egg to the yellow side and the staff attended to us pretty quickly."}
{"text":"I love the mashed potato stuffed omelet. But can you really go wrong with mashed potatoes in anything??  Portions are good size, I usually only order a half omelet or get a full and share with a friend.   My one complaint is the homestyle fries are way over seasoned. All you can taste is salt salt salt. I usually order mine unseasoned for this reason.   Price is definitely good for the portion size."}
{"text":"Our server Michelle was great! So nice and helpful and breakfast was delicious. We had the creeps and the veggie bene. Both delicious. We will definitely be back next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"My sister and I had our breakfast here and the food is so great and so is our server for the day, her name is Bridgette(is my spelling is right) and she was so nice and really gave us good service. Keep it up and we'll come back soon. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The pancakes taste like they come out of a Bisquik box: very dry and bland. They brought out all of our plates except one, which we had to ask them for and then wait another 5 minutes for them to actually bring it to our table"}
{"text":"I always struggle with a large omelette so I made a comment to our server Michelle and she informed me that I could order a half order!  The food was good and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Maria did a terrific job serving us! Here's hoping she gets to California! Loved the food too. This was my first time eating there. Amazing."}
{"text":"Tracy was our server today... She was awesome!! Got everything out as soon as we asked for it!! Couldn't be happier with the service we received today. The food is always great and we always have what we need! Thanks to everybody at the egg works :)"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service, came for the first time the other day, Waitress treated my group awesome. she was always checking up on us if we needed anything. 5/5 Would recommend eating here again!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast. Great food and quick service. Candice was awesome and made our first visit very enjoyable. We will be back next time we're in town. Thank you Candice and Egg Works."}
{"text":"I have been going here since this location opened and unfortunately they have declined with the customer service end, The food is still good but the front counter folks and the newer servers don't seem to listen and you have to ask twice or more, 1 cash register really??? I have always said this was wrong, there is almost always 2 employees at the counter and only 1 register, My last two visits   have not been friendly at all, I went 2 weeks back and today and both the same,  i asked my server 3 times for lemon for my drink and never got it but that's Ok my glass was empty most of the visit anyways I guess.    I have to rethink if I shall return,"}
{"text":"Very pleasant and helpful staff.  Donna our waitress made this a very special breakfast experience for visiting guests.    Food is good and the staff is awesome."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great portions. The service was the best part. Ashley our server was very kind, friendly, and so patient with us. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very busy but very efficient service. Banana Nut Muffins as good as everybody says. Great omelet. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We always come here after church on sundays!! Love their banana muffin... the manager is always checking on you if everything's ok and the service is fast.. this is our regular routine on a sunday.. my husbands gets the \"WORKS OMELET\" and I always get my \"Mushroom cheese sour cream omelet\""}
{"text":"I ordered Food to go because I didn't have time for to fix Breakfast this morning. So I visited Egg Works. I found that Its a bit overpriced. Eggs, Pancakes, sausage, & waffles were average tasting.  If you can spend time making them yourself at home, I encourage you to do so. Customer service was friendly."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the food at all.  It was below average.  I feel IHOP is the same or better.  Server didn't seem to interested in helping us or answering any questions we had.  I will not recommended this place or come back here again.  I'm surprised that the reviews are this high.  Maybe today was one of their off days."}
{"text":"Not only is the food great but so is the service! The banana nut bread, potatoes and Veronica are awesome! Eggs are good too, but that goes without saying! Despite the hustle and bustle of the New Year Day crowd, she was still upbeat and very attentive. Made our dining experience superb! The next time you go to Egg Works make sure you are seated in her section. She is awesome!"}
{"text":"We were there on Easter Sunday @10:30 very minimal wait. Our server was ASHLEY she wss super attentive we are party of 4 (2kids in highchairs) the foods was hot and cooked to our specifications. WE LOVE THIS PLACE we are long time locals.  Bloody marys are superb"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a great corn beef and hash?? Freshly made and delicious every time.. Saturday morning breakfast at the bar was delightful with Ash H. as our server.. She was bubbly, attentive and fun!!"}
{"text":"Our server Nicole was incredible! Went out of her way multiple times to ensure we had a wonderful experience! Thank you Nicole!!!"}
{"text":"The stars say it all. On most breakfast items, you can get half orders to try more stuff! Our server Veronica was super awesome!"}
{"text":"A great experience for going there for the first time. I had their loco moco and it was cooked perfect. My server, Eden was very friendly and attentive to our needs. He even asked how my day was which is a good sign of excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. Had the eggs Benedict pizza off servers recommendation and was not disappointed. Thanks for the great service Caitlin."}
{"text":"We ate here while in Vegas a couple of weeks ago. What a great place! Breakfast was delicious with huge servings. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Friday morning for breakfast and it was packed. We thought this was a good sign, until we got our food. I had a waffle with bananas and scrambled eggs and bacon. I the waffle was like cardboard. I couldn't eat more than one bite. I ate most of my eggs, but I felt nauseous afterwards. I also ordered hot chocolate which was pretty good, but thats about it. My husband didn't like his food either - an omelet with sausage links.  The plate with the sausage was swimming in grease. He couldn't even look at it, never mind taste it. We won't be back b/c of the quality of the food."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast after a long weekend in Las Vegas. What an excellent breakfast! Worth the drive."}
{"text":"The waitress took too long to serve us & the food was mediocre at best. I had a crepe but it tasted just like a regular omelette."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in Vegas!!! If your able to get off the strip, this is a must!   Fast and friendly service. Fresh hot food. So many choices it was very hard to choose!   Our server Kathleen was super friendly and helped us with our choices! She was awesome!  This is a hidden gem for sure!"}
{"text":"We wanted some breakfast close by.  We should have just drove to Omelet House!!!  Our server seemed pushy. Like she had a million things to do and we were holding her up.  We told her that we haven't been here before and instead of selling us their top dishes or specialties of the house, she just said \"ok I will be back.\" Really!!!  Food is ok. Way better food and less expensive at other breakfast places. Hubby's chicken fried steak tasted processed. You can't make that fresh?  Server gave us our bill right after she dropped off our food. Even though you say \"take your time\", you might as well have told me to hurry and eat. I need that table!!!   Don't like the concept of the yellow and black egg when you need something. It makes the servers lazy and not work for their tip.  You still need to check on your customers even though they might not need something from the kitchen.   Food was ok. Worst customer service experience.  Sorry. She seemed new.  And if she wasn't, please help her!!!"}
{"text":"So glad to have this place in the neighborhood! We love going here for a yummy weekend breakfast. The potatoes are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Just went there today at Donna is the best!! Super personable and fun! She is extremely knowledgeable of the menu and even gave me a free muffin for my first visit!! She is so sweet and I will be back just  for her!!"}
{"text":"WOW! I can honestly say these people care about their service and quality. We went here on a packed Saturday morning after our kids baseball game. Their was a little wait, but that must mean it is good, right? So, we sat and ordered our food. Mine and my kids food came out, but turns out the waitress messed up when inputting the orders and missed 2. The manager came over right away and apologized and assured the food was coming out and they would take care of it for us. The waitress came over and also apologized and let us know she was new and gave us a huge loaf of their amazing Banana nut bread. The manager then came back over and gave a coupon for our next visit. We were soo shocked as normally business dont seem to care that much! For example, we were at IHOP last weekend and there was a hair in my food. They didn't apologize or anything and had no shame yelling to the line we got a hair. It just goes to show that some businesses really do care."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food! very busy on a Sunday morning and my boyfriend and I were sat at the tiniest table. Our server PK moved us to a bigger table with out even asking, so thoughtful! He really made us feel special."}
{"text":"Love their Mexican omelette and cajun potatoes that come with the egg order. Always good service and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I come here every now and then with a large group of people who come every week.  They have never messed up an order or forgotten anything.  Candice is my favorite server! She's absolutely amazing! She's always happy, helpful, and on top of everything no matter how crazy it gets! Thanks egg works for everything!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place and friendly helpful staff! The food is fresh, the omelets and breakfast burritos will start your day off great!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for brunch a few weeks ago. We sat outside at the patio tables. When our server found out it was our first visit she brought us each out a complimentary muffin,  which they're known for and are delicious. Our meals were both very good and a decent value for the price.  The servings are fairly large so you could split a meal. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Thank you to Egg Works and Assistant Manager Rochelle for remarkable service. I take my elderly father-in-law here once a week because no matter how busy they are, they ALWAYS make room for his wheelchair or walker. They offer a 30% discount for vets, which is what all businesses should do!   Excellent service, amazing food, and discounts for veterans! This is the ONLY place I go for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this morning. Everything was amazing! I got the corn beef hash and my husband got the bacon avocado omelette. Both entrees are very good. And oh my god their banana bread is to die for seriously! The food came out hot and fresh and the servers were sooo nice and friendly! I'm giving this a five star cause they deserve it! I will be coming back probably every week now lol."}
{"text":"Love escaping the office for an early lunch when I am craving breakfast.  Always good and the perfect size for me when I order a half omelette.  Candice is a great server and it really has a family feel.  If you sit at the bar it is almost like dinner and a show watching the staff interact."}
{"text":"The Denver Omelette was awesome and the service was excellent! Thanks Nicole for the great service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!  Free muffins to die for, great service. Huge portions.  I had French toast with fresh strawberries.  My daughter had the chocolate chip mouse pancakes.  Adorable shaped mouse cakes!"}
{"text":"Hard to find a GOOD breakfast place anywhere. This place does not disappoint. Go here! Donna was a fantastic server also!!  Full and happy, from Colorado!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots. Good portion sizes and the banana bread muffin is sooooo good. The service is spotty. Sometimes good, sometimes you have to wait a little longer than usual or they only check on you once and then hand you the bill."}
{"text":"Great hearty breakfast service is a little slow but that could have been because no one explains that they have an egg u flip for service very much like Bubba Gumps lic plate gimmick but food was perfect for the hungry man try the skillets!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service, very clean and good food.  Slight edge over the Cracked E99. We had pancakes, a scramble, an omelette and eggs with porkchops. The pancakes were OK but ranked last overall....it must be the LV water since we've not found a great pancake yet. There was definitely not a shortage of their signature potatoes...maybe a little too much at the table....the next time we might substitute one serving for something else. Pork chops were the breakfast cut size and was slightly too salty but that may be my preference...nevertheless they were a good change over typical sausages.  The banana muffin that was an option over the toast was very good.  Coffee was good and they left a carafe for refills.   Extremely friendly and efficient waitress and cashier topped everything off."}
{"text":"Sat at the counter and was waited on by Shantel.  She was very friendly. Great service and deserves to go to Disneyland. She made breakfast fun.  Food was great!  Have the chili relleno omelet."}
{"text":"Chris was amazing best food and service every time. I strongly recommend this restaurant to everyone!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where the  bad reviews for service are coming from - I've never had anything other than exemplary service at this location (or any of their other locations, for that matter).  As for the food, there's a reason why this is my favorite breakfast place. Whether I'm in the mood for decadent comfort food (the homemade Corn Beef Hash is freaky good) or trying to be good (Greek Scramble with egg whites only is awesome too), I love the food here. Any of the egg dishes can be made with egg whites if preferred, and they have two different fruit medleys available if you don't want the potatoes.  Predictably, it's a bit of a zoo on weekends, and you'll have a bit of a wait on those days, but it's well worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Egg works is probably the best breakfast restaurant chain in town. We usually go to the new one on eastern near seven hills. This one is pretty much the same in quality service and excellent food.   Donna was our server and always close by to check on what we needed. We never had to wait long for refills or anything else. We might have to start coming to sunset over eastern because Donna was so great.   We had different omelettes today and both were delicious. The potatoes are always amazing even though I'm usually a hash brown guy. Won't stop coming to egg works."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. I can't believe we waited so long to eat here. This part of henderson was missing a place like this and it is finally here. Everything in the menu is delicious and you will find yourself looking at other peoples food to figure out what you will order next time.   Our server Jaclyn was so helpful and always around."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast,enjoyed the Western omelette,  Manuela the server  was fantastic, coffee cup stayed full. Dependable meal, consistently good!"}
{"text":"I'm from St. Louis, MO. If a place has biscuits and gravy I have to order it. I have no choice, I am driven! Egg Works has it and I ordered it with two fried eggs on top (there is no other way!) First off, those fried potatoes they serve are the bomb! Crispy and evenly browned, not even remotely greasy. The husband and I gobbled them like fiends. The gravy definitely passed muster with my mid-western heart...rich and loaded with meaty flavor, and no pastiness. My eggs were perfectly cooked, as were my husband's. The biscuits were weird, tough and chewy. No fluffiness here...and they are an odd artificial golden yellow color, throughout. We actually scanned the menu to see what we could get that delish gravy on next time, because I never want to bite one of those creepy biscuits again. We'll be back to try their other offerings, because the plates that sailed by us on their way to other diners looked quite tempting. Coffee was just meh.. not yucky, just meh. We'll order tea next time and find something to smother with that gravy!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in town! Love the atmosphere and the food is great. The banana muffin is so yummy. Their coffee is very good too. Customer service is exceptional, everyone is friendly and service is quick. The business is well staffed and the hours of operation is very convinient."}
{"text":"We went to Egg Works after church with a big party. We got seated right away. Our server was named Jaqueline. She was a great server; very attentive and friendly. Everyone was happy with their food. It was a good experience."}
{"text":"The food was So good. Marianne was super nice and even though it was busy our food came really fast"}
{"text":"Food: GREAT! Service: GREAT! Method of paying: FAIL!! I'd give a 4 or 5 but you don't take AMEX! And by the way, how the hell doI go to an ATM WITHOUT my card? I don't carry my card around, just the one I need. THANKS FOR MESSING UP YOUR 4-5 STAR RAITING! will I come back? Maybe!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome!  And our waitress Donna was the best server I'd had in a long time. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome! Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out and Egg Works did not disappoint. As good as it was (including plenty of TV's so I didn't miss my team), it was Maria's professional, accommodating and kind service that made the visit worth a definite repeat."}
{"text":"Amy L. Was the best server of the best breakfast in Las Vegas!! She's super attentive and took great care of us."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. They mess up our to-go every time we go there. 3/3. Seems like a great place with a lot of regulars."}
{"text":"We had a large group and the service by Victoria was exemplary and very pleasant.  The food was great and timely. Go and enjoy a great breakfast and if you are lucky, Victoria will be your server as well."}
{"text":"I'm really impressed with the overall quality and consistency of this \"chain\" in general; (chain is such a harsh term, I wish I could come up with better verbiage). Their newest location is no exception.  Took a date their for brunch last Sunday, she ordered the Veggie Benny while I had the Country Benny. The country benny was one of the better renditions of biscuits and gravy that I've ever had, with the gravy having a really nice, balanced flavor. It seems like a lot of breakfast gravies that are served with biscuits are just thick and gloppy; more meant to stick to your bones then deliver flavor. Their gravy really shines.  My date loved her veggie benny, especially the grilled tomato and fresh avocado. Service was friendly and customer oriented. I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Being from Kentucky, I have a deep dark desire for biscuits and gravy.  So when I ordered it here in Vegas, I was expecting a pale, underseasoned paste that someone called gravy.  I could not have been more wrong!  These people know what they are doing.  The roux was browned perfectly and the mix of seasonings made this the best gravy I have had IN MY LIFE!!  Gigantic portions that I could not finish made this a place I'd come back to town for!  When you go (and you know you want to), ask for Natasha.  Great service with a warm smile."}
{"text":"We love this place. Tasty food & friendly folks. We got eggcellent service this morning from James. You should send that guy to disneyland!!! Lol!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best breakfast in town. I've been here more times than I can count and the food is always good, the servers are always nice, and the coffee is amazing. I highly suggest this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Okay, so I've been eating breakfast here for, like, five years. I figure it's time I write a review.  I don't have anything particularly unique to add to the other reviews here. The food is pretty consistent, though I commonly order between 4 or 5 dishes. The cooks overdo it with the cheese and Works seasoning sometimes, but I've come to expect that so I plan for it. \"Easy on the cheese\" or \"no seasoning on the potatoes\". They seem cool with that.  The service? It can be hit or miss, though more hit than miss. In fairness, I almost always sit at the counter, and if Rochelle is working, I'm taken care of. I've never had awful service, but the dining room can get really busy and the service suffers for it.  When I first started coming here, I couldn't stand the \"decor\". Sadly, it's grown on me. I'm *this* close to buying a tie-dyed EggWorks t-shirt.   My favorite part? It's a local small business. I feel good supporting them, and that's what's most important... They make me feel good about myself. haha"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful breakfast at Egg Works and perfect service from Candice. My husband had the Santa Cruz skillet which was an explosion of flavors. I had the bacon, eggs, pancakes and biscuits. The biscuits were so light and fluffy they melted in your mouth. Although the food was awesome the best part of Egg Works was Candice. She was upbeat, helpful, attentive and made us creek very welcomed at Egg Works."}
{"text":"So this is one of my top two places to go for breakfast in LV.  Their breakfasts are huge and I have never finished one.  Their fruit plate is really good, and so much fruit!  I also really like their carnitas skillet or whatever it's called.  The service is good and attentive, and the price is right.  I also really like the fresh banana nut muffins that you can get with every meal instead of toast."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. Every trip to Vegas means a pit stop at egg works. Normally the service is amazing but this time is was definitely sub-par.  Maria G. was our server. Her name tag says that she has been here for 2 years but is seems more like her first day. She was very un-attentive. She asked to take our order, but promptly excused herself to go to other tables. After our food came she didn't once come and check on us to see if we needed anything. I understand they have the happy egg and sad egg things on the table and of you need something just flip it to sad, but come on  do I need to flip a sign for you to check of I need a refill on my beverage? Won't be back to this location. Maybe the other locations can do better."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Eggs at their finest!  Dolly, you're the best!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Huge selection for breakfast and lunch. Staff is amazing! Banana nut muffin is DELISH!"}
{"text":"Visiting for the weekend and decided to stop here for breakfast before heading home.  My fiancé had the 3 Pigs Omelette and he said it was delicious, \"like a party in my mouth\". I had the short stack with a side of scrambled eggs and the works potatoes. That too was delicious. At first it may seem like it's a bit pricey but when you see the portions, you'll understand.  Our waitress, Sarah, was great. Friendly, attentive and helpful, as was the rest of the staff. We are definitely coming back on our next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Our server Donna was awesome. We came from the airport and explained we were in a rush and she took care of all 6 of us extremely fast with exceptional service."}
{"text":"Sorry, but if you don't like Egg Works you are probably the type who would boo Santa Claus and throw eggs at the Easter Bunny. What is not to like about this place? The food is exceptional (and huge servings) the staff is a delight (thank you LuAnn) and it's easy to get to for dumb tourist like us who get lost in the shower. Enough said. Just go there with an empty stomach or you may be sorry."}
{"text":"Normally I only post positive reviews but I just couldn't pass on this. Our server Eathan deliberately over charged us on my son's meal. The amount he over charged was exactly his tip. He tried to take off the over charges and I said no. Then he wanted to take care of my whole bill and I still said no. I paid for meal and so did he. Horrible costumer service. I have many friend and family members that won't be to happy to hear about this. Good luck getting to Disneyland kid."}
{"text":"Tamara is a wonderful server!! She really helped me what to decide what to get! Since it is my coming here"}
{"text":"I've been here many times, it's close to home, and the food is great. I love the veggie omelet. Our server Melissa is very courteous and brought our food quickly. I'll be here more often when I retire in 2 years."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! Donna was our waitress yesterday and she is fabulous. She regularly checked in to make sure we were okay, and our glasses were never empty. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My favorite consistent all american make it the way I like breakfast joint.  I don't eat meat or eggs so I order the veggie skillet and add broccoli in place of egg over their seasoned potatoes with a flour tortilla.  They make it incredible every time and the service is always fast, good and I never wait more than a couple minutes for sitting.  I do love their packaged items such as their loaf of banana bread, salsa and the seasoning salt."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast.  Have never ordered lunch here, so I can't comment.  But the breakfast is really good.  Eggs cooked to perfection, great bacon, great banana nut muffin, decent potatoes, and excellent coffee.  The omelets are big, and good.  And the chicken fried steak is pretty good too.  Good service even when it's busy... which it usually is at breakfast.  Decent prices for what you get."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the quality of food and remarkably friendly service especially from a lady named \"Jill\" who was one of the most friendly and efficient wait staff I've ever encountered... never rushed even though it was at closing time, checked back for refills and quickly brought additional napkis etc.  Most of all was her genuine smile and helpful demeanor.  This is a truly homey-feeling place which is close to home and will become a frequent eatery for this patron."}
{"text":"I wish the Server had written down her name or told us her name so I can mention her for this review to help her  win the trip to Disney.  Anyway, our food total was $28.17 table 17/1 receipt time 10:12 am dated 3/26/16. She was nice and courteous and didn't rush us. She wasn't attentive but I was okay with that at this type of restaurant.  My reason for a 2 star rating is that my Omelet was burnt at the bottom and the meats inside were hard and the taste was bland. The cottage cheese tasted way better. I was very disappointed at the food but the service was nice enough. I'm sure I will never return."}
{"text":"The chicken, mushroom and spinach skillet over scrambled egg whites were phenomenal. Got a free banana nut muffin, too. Kids love their chocolate chip pancakes. Merissa our server was fantastic."}
{"text":"This is a great family restaurant with an extensive menu, generous portions and good service. I've eaten the California Egg Crepe, The Cabo (breakfast burrito) and most recently 3 Way Chili (spaghetti, chili and cheese). Do yourself a favor and enjoy a cup of coffee with a banana nut muffin. It's a nice treat. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The food was good, but I was most impressed by the service. Although we showed up around 9 a.m. when the restaurant was very busy, we only waited for 20 minutes. The staff worked together well to provide attentive service. Waitress was friendly. This place deserves its rating."}
{"text":"I had omelet and avocado . I think this meal will be my breakfast lunch and dinner . A Lot of calories but good food  . I wish they had low calories options 2 eggs instead of 4 with no cheese. Marc was our server and he was a nice server"}
{"text":"The food tasted fine but looks processed & not healthy. Service was great but giving 2 stars instead of 3 stars because of poor quality food & the receipt you receive says to submit a review on Yelp and you can win a trip to Disneyland. That's why there's so many positive reviews here."}
{"text":"Vegetarian Crepe @TheEggWorks mmm so good! When you're there, ask for Donna! Your breakfast comes with a hug! #vegas #lasvegas #eggworks"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went to eat breakfast. This is my first time here. Awesome food but what made it  good experience was my server. She was sweet attentive and all around welcoming. Even listened to my boyfriends long story about how the Cowboys shouldve went to thw superbowl which was cool. When I come back again Im going in her section for sure! Thanks Ashley!! Go Cowboys!! Lolol. Just kidding. Im a Chargers fan."}
{"text":"Yum, yum ,yum!!! Walking out with a full belly, leftovers, and a smile. I have always enjoyed the food here, but this time (egg-specially) the service was aaaamazing! Our waitress, Victoria the key manager, was fantastic. Made sure our orders were all correct, brought us extra coffee without being asked, and suggested checking in for a free muffin...the banana nut muffins here are absolutely delicious!   Great breakfast, brunch, and lunch place."}
{"text":"Food is good, but HORRIBLE SERVICE. Had Bad Service once , gave them the benefit of the doubt, went back, Had Really Bad ( No) Service. Spoke to a Manager ( that was no help) \"We'll get someone over as soon as we can\" so, we left, having already been there the better part of 20 minutes with NO Service & waitstaff walking right by us.  I might add, that these were weekdays & not very busy at all.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Marc was fabulous even though our food took a lot longer than usual. Second time to this location to this location and not impressed. But would come back and see marc again"}
{"text":"Just got done eating the most delicious Veggie Benny at Egg Works. I can never eat breakfast anywhere but here. There food is always so scrumptious and there staff is super friendly. Speaking of staff, Donna is quite the wonderful waitress. She was fun and attentive to our needs. We didn't even have to wait for a refill. I can't wait to come back next weekend."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and delicious food! Dennis was attentive, courteous, and I truly appreciated that he remembered me and my order. As busy as it was, he didn't forget to check on me and make sure everything was just right. I highly recommend the ham and mushroom skillet. Piping hot seasoned potatoes, diced ham, and FRESHLY sliced mushrooms topped with eggs. Perfection.  I look forward to coming back to this location because they never disappoint. :)"}
{"text":"Rossy the server was great!  Very friendly and had a nice smile. Breakfast was fast and delicious! Will definitive back"}
{"text":"This place is all around AMAZINGGG. If possible, I make sure to visit this place for breakfast, brunch, or even lunch every time I was in vegas. Now that I'll be living in Henderson, I'll be going here even more often! Service is always on point. They are quick, enthusiastic, and very friendly. KATHLEEN is especially awesome and beautiful if I might add. Really just one of the best breakfast establishments you'll ever go to.   My top 3  1. Corn Beef Hash 2. Country Fried Steak 3. The Works Skillet"}
{"text":"Great place to hang and eat hearty food!! Service is fast!!! Food is huge and tasty! Also great for kids."}
{"text":"Great food as always,our waitress \"Rachelle\" was super cool and very attentive....We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Our family LOVES Egg Works.  This is the only place to get the best eggs benedict breakfast.  Their portion sizes are HUGE and the food tastes amazing.  We just went on Christmas Day (Observed) and Raul was our server.  He was tentative, friendly, and made my girls laugh (which is super tough to do in the mornings :) ).  Thanks Raul and Egg Works."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome table service BUT their \"Senior\" hostess (Linda?) was terrible.  We walked in, no greeting, she just rolled her eyes and sat us.  I also work in the service industry and that is a very bad first impression.  I've eaten at egg works a thousand times and their servers are always on their A game, she should take pointers from them on customer service.  She only has ONE job.  The food is excellent but too bad their hostess gave me a bad taste today, PLEASE FIX IT EggWorks!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this great local restaurant chain for about 5 years, the first 3 at the West Flamingo location, and the last 2 years at this South Rainbow location.  The food is great (my favorite is the homemade corned beef hash and eggs), and the service is superb.    The only thing that has been bothering me lately is that every time I go (for the last 2 years), the only music that is played is country.  I like some country music a lot, but much of it I find boring, repetitive and depressing, the same sounds, rhythms and melodies coming out of barely different mouths.  When I asked a manager if they could mix up the music I was told that upper management wants only country music playing at all their restaurants.  I find this pretty ridiculous. . . Even if I lived in Texas, I wouldn't want to hear only country music every time I went out to eat.  Life and eating out shouldn't be that monotonous.  If this doesn't change soon, I will be forced to drive further to go to another breakfast/lunch restaurant just to give my ears a break."}
{"text":"Great spot! The chicken enchilada omelet was delicious with well seasoned potatoes. Our server Candice was great!"}
{"text":"Jayna was our server for a big group of 9 people . She was very helpful and attentive .The food speaks for itself, but her service was impeccable . I will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent food all the time!! Great service with Veronica today!! Coffee is great as well and they actually have flavor creamer"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch my brother and I, and we had the cheeseburger, I wanted mine medium and my brother's well done. Unfortunately both burgers were well done but the waitress (Candice) noticed that and asked me if I would like my burger to be replaced. I didn't want to wait anymore so I just when ahead and started eating it. Suddenly, Candice came back with our check with a 20% off. She was great about it and apologized about the burgers being messed up."}
{"text":"Service is awesome, and just when I thought I couldn't be happier the food arrived... our new breakfast joint."}
{"text":"The food and service are always great!! A shout out to my server Maria! She is excellent. I hope you win!"}
{"text":"Customer service was good.  The portions were large but not so tasty. I wanted hot tea to drink and I was given a Linton tea bag with hot water which was tasteless."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!  Mine was more traditional- eggs, waffle, sausage - my friends was more exotic.  Both were expertly prepared.  Or server, Merissa was great and made good recommendations..I am now a fan."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! This is the best breakfast place in Las Vegas without a doubt. It is a MUST!   A detailed review would just waste your time....Time you can use to go to Egg Works and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had breakfast here for the first time this morning...her spinach omelette and me the chili omelette...both were excellent. The service was also excellent...will definitely make this our Sunday stop."}
{"text":"The loco moco is really good. I took my family and friends and they loved the food and the service. This is a must go for breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, quick service. Just opened so they are experiencing a little bit of growing pains but it is great anyway!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here today for breakfast before I got back on the road and I was so impressed!  I'd found the place on yelp and liked the good reviews, so I had moderate to high expectations going in.  Every single one of them was met!  The food was excellent (original breakfast burrito with a side of country potatoes), the service was equally as good (August was our server, and she was super friendly and attentive.  I never had to ask for more soda or my check).  I will definitely be stopping in here again!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place. Lives up to their good reputation. Tables for two there was no wait for us even as late as 9am. Service was prompt! Food came fast and was DELICIOUS! Excellent experience.   We love that they have these cute little easier to help staff know whether we need service. We flipped ours for fun after quickly choosing from the menu, and our server Ashley jumped even quicker to take our order. Best prompt and cheerful service we've received in a while!  You rock, Ashley!"}
{"text":"This place is a must for breakfast! I have been going here been eating here for several years and the food and service have been consistently good. Prices are very reasonable and portions are humongous. I've tried a bit of everything on the menu and have not been disappointed.   The warm banana muffins are the best and you can pre-order a banana loaf to go (which I have yet to do for fear of the havoc it will wreak on my waistline). Love the hash browns. They also have Hawaiian breakfast specialties."}
{"text":"Manuela was terrific as always... We love this placeGr8 food & service!  Food has varied menu for breakfast or lunch, always fresh and prepared to suit. I do recommend that you try it"}
{"text":"We walked into Egg Works with no expectation other than wanting to enjoy a good breakfast. We luckily sat down at Carla's station and she was simply amazing; so personable and sweet. We will be back next time we are in town. Thanks for making our first time so memorable!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, I have been going to it for years. Overall the best service, sometimes the wait is long since they are always busy but definitely worth it. The potatoes are delicious and the banana nut muffin to die for. They also serve lunch and the sandwiches do not disappoint."}
{"text":"The key manager Catlin is the best server and key manager she always take very good care of us"}
{"text":"First time coming here and was not disappointed. My waitress was MacKenzie and she was one of the best servers I have ever had. She constantly made sure to check up on us. She was very knowledgeable of the foods and the store. I ordered a breakfast burrito . The burrito was very filling. There was a large portion of potatoes that came with it. It was enough food that I was not able to finish it all, especially for a big guy like me. I was not disappointed and would be happy to come back again."}
{"text":"Our server Donna was great! So kind and helpful. Even brought us an extra muffin!!! We'll be back.   Country Benny was awesome."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and while the food is nothing to write home about, it's a decent source of consistent, generously-portioned breakfast food. The potatoes can be a real salt bomb but that isn't exactly surprising.  I usually get the classic (eggs, potatoes, meat, side of bread/muffin), which I did once again on my most recent visit. I asked to substitute the bread/muffin for a pancake and was told that there would be a \"small upcharge.\" Cool, I figured, imagining an extra $2-3 on my bill since hey, it's a couple pancakes, I'm getting them in lieu of the toast/muffin I'd already be paying for, and the upcharge would be \"small.\"  I was charged the full amount for a short stack pancake meal ($6.10 approximately). The manager would not budge on this, and I never received toast or a muffin to take home. This ticked me off because I'd effectively paid the full price for The Classic, didn't receive 1/4th of the components of the meal, and paid additionally for what was regarded as a full second meal on my bill.   I won't be coming back. The full cost of another meal item is not a \"small upcharge\" and I absolutely should have been warned by my server after she'd spoken to the manager and found out about the immutable billing for as bizarre a request as a substituted pancake. I would have opted for something different or simply asked for the toast or muffin that should have already been included with my meal had I been sufficiently warned.  TLDR; Visit Egg Works if you want mediocre-to-passable quality food, but don't you dare ask for a modification to your meal. What's that customer service thing again?"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Our server, Amanda, was awesome. She gave great suggestions and was attentive. She is also super sweet. Definitely come here for good food and service!"}
{"text":"first time at this location & it was great. although it was busy we were seated fast. our server, veronica was on point, friendly & provided excellent service. and once again, although it was a busy sunday afternoon, our food arrived super fast. i would recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast before heading to the airport because it has very good Yelp reviews. It was busy but the service was great. Got seated right away and served in a reasonable time. I ordered the Santa Cruz skillet which had potatoes, chicken, chorizo, and a special \"Santa Cruz sauce.\" Took one bite all I could taste was salt and a packet of taco seasoning. I would have never ordered something with those flavors but their lack of description duped me. The chorizo was ground too finely and the chicken was lunch meat cut into squares. Also, the potatoes were strange squares that were not at all fresh. The Yelp reviews are extremely inflated due to what was written at the bottom of the receipt about servers winning a trip to Disneyland if they get the most positive reviews. The servers were great and the manager was even on the floor, but they need new cooks. Avoid if you want a good breakfast."}
{"text":"This place never disappoint. Come here at already once a week, and always leave happy. NANCY, best server here. Highly recommend you request here if she is available. Always attentive an very personable."}
{"text":"awseome food great service and nice looking ladys what more can  you ask for. the works potatos are great, huge portions. and a $8 off coupon, AWESOME"}
{"text":"We all know that Ms. Shantil is an AWESOME server.  Her friendliness and great customer service skills is what keeps us going back, along with the YUMMY food. Everything we have ever eaten there has been of great quality and taste.  We look forward until our next visit. *:) The next time you visit Egg Works on the weekend and your able to sit at the counter,  you can watch and get to experience the way that girl works!! Go Shantil!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service by Ashley. It seemed like she was passing out banana muffins like they grew on trees lol. Food was also good! Had the spinach, mushroom, and chicken skillet with egg whites. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I don't know about you guys but our server Kathleen is so not people friendly not the type of person you want to meet early on the morning for breakfast, Hot chocolate and vanilla cappuccino taste the same, I accidentally switched it my kids, they can't tell the difference too, lol! By the way I ordered pancake not a big cookie, lol! Pancake so dry!!!"}
{"text":"Went in for a quick bite alone so I sat at the bar. Server was Melinda and she was very friendly and on top of it, even though she seemed quite busy! I had the bacon maple French Toast which was out of this world- she suggested the 1/2 portion, which I didn't know was available- and it was plenty! I'll be back... sooner than later!!!"}
{"text":"Good was amazingg and the service was too! Came to have breakfast with the family. Jessica (server) was a sweetheart"}
{"text":"I have two kinds of breakfasts I like when I eat out: the first is usually with visitors who want a unique experience and are usually still drunk when they wake up so we will hit one of the delicious options on The Strip. The other breakfast option is my more frequent trip down the street to a comfortable friendly place like Egg Works. I don't look for anything fancy and it is the ambience and service that brings me back regularly. This is most definitely the case with Egg Works. The greeting is always welcoming but the severs take everything to another level and make you feel more like you are visiting friends than dining out. I'm an early bird so I can usually anticipate a seat outside on the patio where I am often doted on by the friendliest staff you could hope for. I am not an adventurous breakfast eater and usually stick to the basics, which are consistently fresh and well prepared. If there is anything to truly rave about though it is the captivating personalities of the staff. Las Vegas is a town where you should expect good service and this vibe certainly infuses Egg Works. Not only is the wait staff friendly, efficient and hospitable, the extra bit of personality offered up just brings the whole experience to another level and starts my day off with a great positive vibe. If you ever want to practice overtipping, this is the place to do it since the servers make you feel so welcome and appreciated.I have even developed my own \"server crush\" and always ask if the lovely Nicole can, you know, \"butter my bread.\""}
{"text":"Egg Works is a good place to go for breakfast since Vegas doesn't have the best options for locals. The service is pretty good and the menu has a wide selection. However, I dislike their coffee and it is a little expensive."}
{"text":"Disgusting.. brought my 9 yr old here for breakfast and we both took a few bits, paid the bill, and will never return. I have had better meals at Mcdonalds. Kind of pricey for the shitty quality. I have been to one of the other vegas egg works and it was delicious.. not sure what went wrong here...2 stars for customer service."}
{"text":"Really good! Great atmosphere and good service. The home fries and banana nut muffin were especially good."}
{"text":"Came in for a Sunday breakfast and though they were busy they were able to seat us within 15 minutes. I had the chicken fried steak which was a little salty but excellent. My wife had an avocado and mushroom omelette which she enjoyed. Our waitress was Marianne who, because we had a problem with my wife's initial order being too salty, went above and beyond in solving our problems and making recommendations. Dolly the manager even went so far as giving us a free loaf of their muffin bread to compensate for the inconvenience with my wife's first order.     I highly recommend Egg Works as a breakfast spot and if you can get Marianne as your waitress, all the better."}
{"text":"Our server Ashley was amazing! The food was delicious & the server was courteous enough to make me a special omelette that wasnt on the menu! GREAT  service!!!!"}
{"text":"Marlene was a wonderful server. Friendly and knowledgable!  Egg Works was very good and they had a decent vegetarian menu"}
{"text":"My wife and I just had breakfast this morning.  She had the Fresh Veggie Omelette and I had 2 Banana Cakes with a side of scrambled egg.  Although the food was delicious, what made this an exceptional experience for both of us was the impeccable service we received from Andrea.  Her attention to details, flawless service, and her extremely pleasant disposition made our dining experience extremely pleasant and one normally associated with a fining dining establishment.  I would highly recommend Egg Works try to have Andrea cloned, I sense she is what the Gold Standard would be."}
{"text":"Always love coming here, the staff is always quick and polite and the food is always so delicious. My favorite is the chili rellano and the stuffed french toast sandwich. Sooo good and they're potatoes have delicious seasoning. The fruit is super fresh. Diana was our server and she was such a sweetheart and took good care of us, will definitely keep coming back here. One of the best breakfast places in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Great foods (love the Habla Diablo potatoes), environment feel great with a down the earth look, and great people (workers).  Especially our server TRACY, she's very attentive, hard working and she exhaust a easy-going vibe. With server like her, I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Showed up on a weekend morning and didn't have to wait at all to be seated. My party ordered the special, a pork burrito and some of their different pancakes.  All around everyone was happy and no one was disappointed.   The servers were prompt with bringing extra salsa and clearing the table of dirty dishes.   There are television's mounted on the wall so the wait for food went by fast. Also, the bathrooms aren't too large so you might have to wait but they are clean.   The only thing I would point out is that you are better off probably not ordering the fruit juice since it is not freshly squeezed but otherwise their menu is aces."}
{"text":"The food was perfect and my server Kelli was more than helpful and polite. I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time eating here and not impressed at all!!!!  Banana nut muffin was horrible all I could taste is nutmeg.. it took almost 20 minutes to get a refill, potatoes had way too much seasoning and the biscuits and gravy had a bland funky taste.  The food was salty and I do not recommend this restaurant for breakfast let alone to waste $25 on two plates!!!"}
{"text":"Egg-cellent service! Our server Amanda was amazing; she was fast, attentive, and burned her arm for us. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Many options for breakfast. Our server Heather was right on. Always there when we needed something and offering suggestion which were spot on!"}
{"text":"Love this place so much! The skillets are great and the banana muffins are so yummy! Service is always good and it's a great happy place to have breakfast. They even have loco moco- one of my husband's new favorites. Tastes just like Hawaii. The portions are HUGE and the prices are very good, especially for the quality and the amount of food that you get. This place and the Hash House A Go Go are our favorites."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for breakfast.  An assortment of items on the menu that male it tough to decide what to order.   Candice is over the top with her service."}
{"text":"The potatoes are awesome. End of story. That's all you need to know.   I went with a family friend the other day, and she encouraged me try something new. I had wanted to order a hamburger because I'd been watching a ton of Gilmore Girls and they eat a burger in almost every single episode. So, I ordered the chicken cordon bleu skillet. It comes with potatoes on the bottom; chicken, ham, and cheese on top, with 2 eggs on the very top. I really wanted to break my egg yolk, but I was scared to what would happen to the taste of the food. I did get sourdough bread as my side which was not that sour. I prefer sourdough to be tangy.  We did order a banana nut muffin which is famous. It was pretty tasty, and I don't normally like bananas. It was delicious and warm! The potaotes tasted super yummy! They were flavorful and nice and crispy. I would definitely go back for the potatoes alone!"}
{"text":"So good!! I love this place. I go once a week and have never been disappointed. Even when they are slammed they still get my food out quickly. I swear if it wasn't so good I would say its all pre made. The muffins you get with your meal are like thew best part. i have order a loaf to take home. Bad idea lol. You just end up eating the whole thing in a day."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I've been here several times and have never had a bad experience! Our server today was Jennifer, and she was on her game!!! I'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"While I found the crepes to be a little rubbery, (yes, I know they're egg-heavy, but that should not mean rubbery, it should mean spongy...) everything else was delicious. However, it was not what I ordered. I realize they are busy, and we arrived at 8am on Friday. I didn't bother to complain however, as it looked too good to turn down. Be aware that it's not real Hollandaise, or at least, not the best I've ever had, but whatever it is, it's tasty. Portions too large to finish."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. I had the recommended corn beef hash with eggs and others had spinach egg bani. It was all around good. Service was on point as well as overall experience. If I lived here in Vegas I would visit this place again."}
{"text":"Egg Works is one place in our rotation for normal breakfast places.  You can always count on them to provide a large portion of tasty breakfast foods.  I usually lean towards the skillets (though this time I went with one of their burritos) and my wife got the waffles.  Their food is great, but not mind-blowing. The muffins are awesome and your bang-for-your-buck is totally worth it.  We get two meals out of each plate.  Our waitress was Ashley, who was so cute and bubbly.  Typically we'll end up with a nice, though a bit jaded, waitress who struggles to keep up.  Ashley, on the other hand, was amazing.  Super attentive and engaging.   Definitely our favorite waitress out of the last several times we've been here."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service from Veronica today at Egg Works! I would definitely recommend this place to friends, ask for Veronica for the best service!"}
{"text":"Not gross, not fantastic. We've eaten breakfast here many times. It used to be really good, but the last few times that we've gone the food and service has been disappointing. I like that they'll put bananas inside the kid's pancakes if you ask.   I think we've pretty much crossed it off our list of go-to places, but I'm sure we'll end up eating here again in the future since it's close to home."}
{"text":"If you want breakfast or lunch this is THE place!! Food is awesome and the banana muffins.... oh my!!!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently awesome. The food is yummy (the potatoes!) and the service is killer. I always seem to have Tamara at my table and she is so sweet and accommodating. Great local joint."}
{"text":"I just left here feeling content and satisfied. Candace was our server and took care of us well. I asked our friend in Las Vegas to take us the best breakfast place she knew of and she took us here. I ordered the Chile Relleno omelet and Cinci  Coney dog and those were delicious.  I highly recommend this to others."}
{"text":"Had the chili relleno omelet, recommended by the waitress. Very over cooked and thin, a couple of canned chili's in the middle, way too much cheese. I believe the cheese was thicker than the omelet. It was topped off with some canned or or jarred taco sauce and a dollop of sour cream. Only potatoes they had were frozen tater tots or potato \"shredded\" hash browns, which looked exactly like a McDonald's hash browns. I ordered rye toast which was some type of rye/pumpernickel swirl that tasted like neither.   I had wanted pancakes instead of the toast and potatoes but this was not a option. It would have cost me an extra $6.25. No thanks. The only saving grace was the coffee tasted good but was $2.75 for a small mug, with the thermal pot left on the table; pour your own.  Total with tip was $16.06 with a 15% tip. To top it off, they have an improper ventilation/hood system in the kitchen for I walked around the rest of the day smelling like I worked there. Sorry, cannot recommend on any level, except maybe coffee to go."}
{"text":"We ate here last month.  Incredible service and food.  The country potatoes were the best.  Wish there was one close to us."}
{"text":"First Yelp review! We were impressed with the friendly greeting and great service as soon as we came in. With 3 young kids, some places aren't real friendly, but these ladies were great! We had one mistake on our order, but they fixed it right away and did it with big smiles. The only reason for loss of a star was the restroom...out of TP, oops! We will definitely be coming back for the great service and awesome food!"}
{"text":"The sundance special was amazing & good coffee. Solid breakfast place, Robert was a great server everything came out correct and fast."}
{"text":"If you have high blood pressure, this is not a place you should be eating. I guess if you cover everything in salt and cheese people will love it. Flavor is just not there. Service kind of sucks too. Two breakfasts with tip was $36...that included one small oj and water to drink. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Yo this place is fire! Ashely was our server and she took hecka good care of us. I wish I had 4 hands so I could give this place 4 thumbs up. We had mimosas and coffee, both were super bomb. Ashely made great suggestions; guiding my homeboy to the cabo burrito, upgrade from the regular. Not only did Ashely provide spectacular service, but she also pretty sexy. Much love. Try the steak and eggs."}
{"text":"I love love love this place !!  Great service and tasty food.  A big plus to the delish banana muffins. I always look forward to getting.  We just moved here from Cali and this is by far r fav breakfast place !  Good things to get is the works omlette and the stuffed French toast my hubby likes"}
{"text":"Spinach Benny! My first time here, but I only ordered for take-out. Speedy service and love the friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Staying in Vegas for a few days and wanted a local breakfast instead of over priced resort stuff. Found this place by accident and it was outstanding. Food selection, service, price are all spot on. My wife and I tried different things and both enjoyed. Hardest part was finding only one thing to order from the menu. Whatever you do, don't miss the Banana Nut Muffin. Our server Angela was terrific. We will be coming back again during our trip."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and it's my go-to American breakfast spot in Vegas.  I doubt you can go wrong with anything on the menu here.  I tend to always go with one of their versions of the \"Benny\"... Usually the veggie one.  It's a bit off the normal Vegas radar being located in Summerlin; however, if you feel like trying something new and are out of town, go ahead and make the trek up.  Wait times can be lengthy, but well worth it."}
{"text":"I love coming to eggwork. Me and my roommate come almost every week and have developed great relations with the friendly staff. We almost always get Candice and she is always helpful and cheery. She also always remembers what we orde. Her knowledge about us makes our visita quick, enjoyable and always fun. Thank you Candice for the hot tea and coffee with ALL the caramel creamer."}
{"text":"We came here for the second time last Sunday, Dec. 14 for weekend brunch. The place was busy but we were seated immediately and weren't given a hard time when we requested to be seated in the corner room. We were very happy to have Diana wait on our table because she was super nice during our first visit a couple of months ago. Food was great, service was again, impeccable and exceptional thanks to Diana! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Very clean. Great food!  We went this past Saturday. It was 3 of us and we waited for less than 10 minutes to be seated.  My father had the Waffle Works dish which was waffles and a slab of ham and I think country potatoes. He loved it. My mom had the blueberry pancakes. She loved them. I had the ham and cheese omelet. SOOOO good! One of the best I've had!  The banana nut muffins are really hot and good too! Everything was great! I would totally go back again!"}
{"text":"Food is great as always! Love that the tomatoes have been awesome lately... not mushy or over ripe. :)"}
{"text":"Good food,not as good as it used to be. My favorite is the egg stuffed French toast and the mashed potato omelette."}
{"text":"Food was great as always service was spectacular I would recommend Candace as your server . portions are really big so be prepared to take some home"}
{"text":"First time here, this place is off the hook.  Don't let the name fool you're at food huge portions  it should be the best food and service on the planet.  But that is too long so it's Eggworks.  Start by asking to sit in PK's section. Now it's like you have a butler for your every need.  Great food, huge portions and personal service...oh and prices anyone can afford."}
{"text":"We have never been disappointed with Egg Works. The banana nut muffins are the greatest. Lindsey, our waitress, went out of the way to accommodate us. She is the greatest."}
{"text":"Ok... this was my second visit. I liked this place before, I love it now! Both times I was here the place was busy. Especially if you consider it was during the week, before the time for a 'lunch rush'. Being busy is a good sign that the place is good! . Our server, Marc, was fantastic. He was patient, courteous, and friendly. He answered our questions and was generally helpful.  The food was top notch. I got the corned beef and eggs breakfast. The quantity of food made it more than worth the $11+ cost. My partner has the 'island favorite' which was two thick slices of grilled spam, eggs, and sticky rice. He thought it was really good.  In summary, Egg Works. Even though it's slightly higher cost than some, is on my list of great places to eat and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have now gone to Egg Works on Flamingo about 6 or 7 times and it's the best. Great coffee, Fantastic food and the best waitresses. Maria V. has waited on me several times and she is Great. She has a wonderful personality and really cares about the customers. If I owned a restaurant, I would be trying to hire her away from Egg Works. Sincerely, Mike R."}
{"text":"Always room for growth, I remind our readers as I give raving reviews.  My only beef, which is on the fruity side, is this...no FRESH-SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location and I thought the food overall was pretty good, I ordered scrambled eggs and seasoned potatoes. I thought that the tables were really small and too close together so it was awkward trying to have a personal conversation."}
{"text":"This place offers a great selection of delightfully different breakfast dishes (and sandwiches) along with the standard fare. My wife and I enjoyed the very good service with no surprises. I thought the potatoes they offer are good, but my wife prefers a different style than what was offered. The coffee was merely OK. They must be doing something right because it was obvious from the crowded parking lot they are popular and busy. Enjoyable change!"}
{"text":"Amazing eggs and hash browns! Eggs are so fresh they taste like they have just been plucked from hens out back. Only kidding but that's how great egg works is. The only thing better than their food is the beauty of a server NICOLE, that smile and fast delivery will keep me coming back :)"}
{"text":"The service & food was excellent. I was waiting to be called at the dmv and we all know how long that takes. Our waitress Roslin was amazing! Consistently checked on us and how our food was. The food also came out quickly and was delicious. I will definitely be back soon! Thanks Roslin for the great customer service:)"}
{"text":"Food was great and our server Lexie was very nice.  This place is one of our favorites."}
{"text":"Our server ROB G. Was amazing ! Very attentive and kind ..  food was great ! first time having waffles and he recommended the waffle works -- so good !"}
{"text":"Our company comes here every week for breakfast and we always appreciate the freshness of the food and the excellent service.  Our waiter today, Brandt, was new and still in training, but I wanted to say that he did an excellent job. Service was quick, responsive and friendly. All of the servers are great at this location and Brandt is a welcome addition. Thanks Egg Works!"}
{"text":"The best place for breakfast hands down. oh yeah there is that other great breakfast Joint egg and I. if you don't know there the same  restaurant different name. my girl friend and i love this place. I'm surprise they don't know my order by know. their bacon and onion skillet is the best."}
{"text":"Great warm American style restaurant far away from the busy feel of Vegas.  The breakfasts are large and well prepared. Service is friendly and efficient.  This location also has outdoor seating for mild weather dinning."}
{"text":"Candice at the Sunset Rd location is so pleasant and made sure we were very well taken care of. Food is amazing and filling!  Highly recommend!  Ask for Candice."}
{"text":"Had an amzing breakfast laura served us and gave amazing advice on what to order  it was right on the money delicious  santa cruz breakfast burrito the sauce on top was amazing! Potatoes were so good!"}
{"text":"Four stars for the food, 3.25 stars for the service:  Food:   The potatoes have me dreaming for them at night.  That seasoning is delicious and it has just the right texture.  The first time I went here I had a crepe with avocado and pico.....I can't remember the name of it but it was delicious.  Service: Hmm it was okay.  It could have been better considering that they have eggs on the table to show your server whether you need service or not.  I thought it was genius at first but then began to think of how impersonal it is.  I enjoy servers coming up to me randomly asking how everything is and my water magically re-appearing.  That's when you know your service is good.  The fact that they rely on the clients to passively flip a sign is kind of a turn-off.  Come and talk to me... I won't bite."}
{"text":"I'm from Michigan and every time I'm in Vegas I have breakfast here. The food is always great and plentiful and our server Rossy is great and friendly!"}
{"text":"Bambi and suzzy are amazing servers. We came from L. A. To vegas every year. Egg works is our spot to go to. Food is great. Reasonable prices. Hope one day they expand to Los Angeles."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Great food, very good service very affordable don't hesitate I highly recommended this spot"}
{"text":"I love coming here with my family or my boyfriend. It's a nice place to eat and relax with friends and family. The banana nut muffin is always delicious! I normally get waffle works or the original benny. The portions are perfect. Jacqueline was super sweet and patient so recommend her at your next visit! :)"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast today, The California Creoe was sooo good. Our server was Sarah and she did a great job taking care of us."}
{"text":"I go to breakfast here around 2 days a week. Great & friendly staff. If you're going before work sit at the bar and the food comes out very quick. There's free wifi so bring your idevices.   Food is good. I don't venture out beyond eggs and bacon much but the couple times I've ordered waffles or pancakes they've been good."}
{"text":"We always come here because we love the choices. But today was the first time we got our order correct down to a T. Jacqueline, our waitress, was so sweet enough to make sure they don't give me more then what I requested to make sure I stay on my diet. Thank you! I really appreciate it! Will be back next weekend"}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast, you won't regret it and you will come back like we did."}
{"text":"Donna killed it! Great Service she helped out a lot. Great food. Good time. Big plates."}
{"text":"Awesome food as always. Service is also terrific! Because it was most of our group's first time there, they treated us to a round of banana nut muffins. They are wonderful. I highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Ethan was an amazing server! Served our food quickly and he was very helpful with what good food to get from the menu. Great service over all! Def gonna come back again!"}
{"text":"I love this place... Food is always awesome! Our server Chance was great too. Definitely coming back again"}
{"text":"This has some decent breakfast food but it is always so packed.  The few times I have been here I have always been in a group (about 6+ people).  For about 20 minute wait for seating, I wanted to be wowed by the food.  I have never been wowed, but I never left with an empty stomach."}
{"text":"It's nothing extravagant for breakfast. Certainly not Tableau. But the Eggs Benedict are great along with the banana  muffins. It's not a small meal so come hungry or you will be leaving behind a great meal. The chicken fried steak was good as well. Service with their lil egg you flip when you need something makes it convenient to get a servers attention. I will be back....oh they service alcohol as well. Always nice for a hangover"}
{"text":"Egg works is amazing. The menu is extensive. I had the huge Italian skillet and it was delicious. Taking half home to enjoy tomorrow for breakfast. Server Dolly was attentive but not overbearing.  This will be our stop heading out of Vegas to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food. Ashley was our server. Prompt and friendly. We usually go to the one on Flamingo but will be back here!"}
{"text":"Service wasnt all that great. Was served by a lady in her 40s and she was kind of unprofessional. Also, heard her making jokes about other employees with a male she dint realize how close she was to the table we were seated in. Food was ok. I recommend one of the other locations only because customers shouldnt be listening to whatever drama the employees have."}
{"text":"It was ok. Server left for long time and no refill on drinks. The food was just ok. I was not super impressed. I think they were too busy and not enough help."}
{"text":"This place is just exceptional!  Its near the airport and a bit of a drive from the strip but worth it. You get a free delicious muffin if its your first time. The portions are huge (really too much for one person) but the food is very satisfying, especially the french fries. They even have a happy/sad face egg meter type thing on the table for when you need service or unhappy about something...and they take it seriously! Our waiter was very sweet and everyone seems to communicate very well, one server will cover for another if anything is missing. Unlike some breakfast places, Egg Works also takes reservations."}
{"text":"Excellent service and superb food. Portions were huge and bloody Mary's to boot."}
{"text":"I went in for a visit while in town last week and had a GREAT \"eggsperience!\"  The hostess (Jenny) was incredibly sweet and helped us right away.  She also took care of our drinks (server was a bit busy) and brought us those killer banana muffins  I had a Loco Moko (Hawaiian  breakfast) which was terrific!  My brother had the Bennie - loved it!  The server (can't remember his name but he was awesome too)  was all over it and really worked his tail off!  Awesome experience - better than the other Egg Works in Vegas that I've visited - largely because of the hostess (Jenny) and our server.  I'll definitely be back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why I have not reviewed Egg Works before as everytime I'm in town I eat here and I'm never disappointed.  This food is yummy and the service is always great. This time we tried the French toast which was to die for and will be going back for the Banana Nut French toast soon."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast with outstanding service from Emily. Had the works omelette with fruit that was incredibly delicious. I also had the homemade banana nut muffin which was awesome. I will definitely stop there again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cincy Coney as I am originally from the Cincinnati area and cannot get good cheese coneys here in Vegas. Was hoping finally found something. I was wrong. They are ok I suppose if they are actually hot when served. Service was way too slow. If I return it won't be for lunch and I won't bother with their coneys"}
{"text":"So this was our first time. Every time we are here in Vegas, we always pass by this place. Read all the reviews on Yelp and decided to try it. Just have to say that it was YUMMIE! The portions are big. The kids meal are big enough for two kids to share unless you have a big eater.   I ordered pork and eggs, potatoes, and toast. Since I cannot eat eggs, the waitress let me substitute fruit for the eggs. The potatoes were delicious. It was seasoned and like the potatoes that you get with hash.  My husband ordered stuffed french toast. He thought they were stuffed with fruit and cream cheese (his mistake), but when it came out it was like a french toast sandwich. An egg scramble with meat between two pieces of french toast. The waitress was willing to exchange it for the strawberry and cream cheese french toast (which is the one that he was looking at), but my husband's mistake so he kept his plate. He did enjoy his breakfast. The other people at our table ordered the banana nut french toast and the loco moco. They both were happy with what they ordered. Our waitress was very nice. She kept our drinks filled as best as she could since the restaurant was completely packed. We didn't mention that it was our first time to the restaurant, but she must have figured it out with some of our questions. She brought some warm banana nut muffin to the table, and they were delicious.  We will definitely be coming here more often on our future trips to Vegas."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were craving breakfast so we came here to fill our tummies. I had the breakfast burrito and my gf had the egg works skillet which were both above average. The muffin they bring you is  surprisingly really tasty."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch place!  Great for kids too...  portions are large so make sure you come hungry"}
{"text":"My friend had heard about this place from watching the Food Network/Travel Channel, so we tried it out when we were in Vegas a few weeks ago.  We went for breakfast and the food was great!  I had the Sundance special omelette (which has a lot of different veggies and cheese, no meat, and came with the banana nut bran muffin,  super yum!).  My friends tried the french toast, the prime rib skillet and the eggs with grits.  The portions are pretty generous and all the food we ordered was good.    One thing that we liked was that you can flip the egg sign (which is placed on the table), instead of trying to flag down a waiter.  They'll come once they see the unhappy egg sign.  Pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast/brunch.  The Works Omelet was very good and the warm banana nut muffin with butter was awesome.  Natasha gave great recommendations and was a terrific waitress.  Send her to Disney!"}
{"text":"Wow!  One the best service we've had and best breakfast menu I've come across in awhile. What a gem!  I'd go back anytime. Wish they had restaurants in LA!  They are the best!  Hands down.   Loco moco was way better than expected!  Better than most Hawaiian restaurants, Seriously. There potatoes were the bomb. Basted eggs were cooked to perfection.   Can't wait to go back to Vegas so we can eat there again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location to have breakfast with the LOML  the food is just so amazing ! Caitlin was amazing and so sweet & attentive!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome friendly place with great food and service. Highly recommended. I had hash and eggs for breakfast. The banana nut (option to toast) was warm and delicious.   Enjoy"}
{"text":"1st time and it was awesome!! Brought half my meal home because the portions are huge. Jody was my server. She was awesome and very welcoming. Loved the banana nut muffin. Ask for Jody when you come to the Town Center location."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast and I had the strawberry and cream cheese french toast. It was alright but nothing to run home and tell mama about lol. The two things I really did enjoy were the potatoes and the syrup they have me with my meal. Our waiter was awesome and I had a pretty good time here."}
{"text":"My family and I had a great time at Egg Works today. I ordered the moco loco and it was delicious. My family ordered 2 bacon and onion skillets and 1 stuffed French toast platter, all of which were delicious. Our waitress Ashley was attentive and sweet. The service was fast and accurate, which was impressive since the place was packed to the gills with people. I look forward to visiting again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We always ask for Donna's section! I always order the stuffed French toast with sausage links! It's AMAZING you have to eat it! Always ask for Donna she'll always brighten your day with her spunky personality!"}
{"text":"Love love love the grandma's biscuits and gravy.. sever is a hit or miss but food is always great!!!"}
{"text":"Caitlin was great ...best loco moco outside of the islands !!! Food is always outstanding...came all the way from Texas to eat here !!! I would highly recommend to all to eat here !!!"}
{"text":"Blade is a amazing and entertaining server! You can tell she loves customer service and I appreciated her enthusiasm especially since we had a large party!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on monday..awesome omelets we shared 1 and it was still to much. The food is always good and the wait staff is even better, Twila waited on us this time and she got everything just right for us..great value too. Stop by and see them soon"}
{"text":"Definitely a nice breakfast brunch spot i'll be returning to when I return to Vegas.  They have a fairly large menu and an interesting way of telling your server you're in need of something.  (There's a little egg that you flip on the table if your need anything) We never had to flip our egg because our server Victoria was very on it, but it's a neat features nonetheless."}
{"text":"Brandy was great! We have a huge family, and some of us can be super high maintenance. But Brandy handled it very well and was patient with us. Food was awesome like always too!"}
{"text":"I woke up in my hotel room and decided I wanted to try something off the strip, and ventured the 5ish miles here.  I am so glad I did.  The menu was huge, the portions were huge (even the kid's meal), the food was great, and you're served a warm banana nut muffin in lieu of toast (if you want).  Our server, Donna, was friendly and right on top of it, even though it was busy.  I never had to ask for anything because she always beat me to it.    I had the pork carnitas crepe and it was delicious."}
{"text":"The Mexican omelette was super yummy and would get it again. The works scrambled was good but contained way too much feta cheese. The waffle works were good but the waffles were not crunchy and the eggs were greasy but everything was still yummy."}
{"text":"Char was amazing! Our eggs Benedict was perfect as always! This is by far our favorite place to eat on Sunday's and for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Char was crazy awesome! She made 5-star service look effortless. Char even rallied the team for combo support continually.   Hospitality!!!! That's what it's all about. Clone this woman."}
{"text":"Great food, no wait, and solid service. Our server Ashley is super sweet and fast! My husband is vegan and was able to swap options to make it his own. Can't beat Sunday morning breakfast at Egg Works."}
{"text":"Donna was our server today and she was AMAZING!!! Orth the wait for sure.   She remembered everything we ordered without writing it down. Impressive.  Xoxo"}
{"text":"Our server, Luanna, did a great job! She seemed to like her job as well. Just the right amount of talking and check-backs. We are all fat and happy!"}
{"text":"I go here every week because I love the food and thorough service. This place has a diverse menu and generous portions. Candace is wonderful and has been taking care of me for years. During my most recent visit, I met Ashley who was very sweet, proactive and attentive.  I love this place, and will continue to come for years. Thanks, egg works!"}
{"text":"First time to eat there. Really good experience with good food and service. When we walk in, a nice lady greeted with a smile on her face. When I asked for recommendation, she did introduce patiently.  For the food, all my friends and I loved our own orders. We had some omelets, scrambles and fried steak. My friend said his orange juice was freshly squeezed, and thats why its worth more than 3 bucks. My chicken Omelet had some cheese on the top, and tasted really yummy.  The orders were very big that was enough for me. Should go again."}
{"text":"Great food...we all had breakfast and very delicious and our server Jennifer was OUTSTANDING she's a must when you visit so ask to be seated in her section...."}
{"text":"The omelet was ok but the coffee was weak and terrible. The potatoes were a frozen square product that were pathetic. Any breakfast place that really cares would peel real potatoes like a good diner but not this place.THis place doesnt know quality."}
{"text":"This was my first restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas. I got off the plan from Nyc and wanted breakfast bad. My friend said I have to try Egg Works it's the best. She wasn't lying the food was great! Portions were big and our server Jacqueline was awesome. She was so polite and friendly. The whole experience was great. I never had the urge to make a yelp review this is my first one! I definitely recommend Egg Works! Thanks Jacqueline for being so cool and friendly I will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Our server Jennifer is the best.  She is always upbeat and friendly.  The food and service here is outstanding."}
{"text":"I love Egg Works they always make me feel welcome and the food is  always great! Katy seated us today, Veronica was our server and Storm was out cashier! Just wanted to give them a shout out for there excellent  service! Thanks guys see you soon!"}
{"text":"Food is always good.  Pk is the best waiter!   We go there often and have never had a bad meal no matter what we order."}
{"text":"Great food! Joey was great. Gave me directions to where I needed to go. Offered great service!! Great coffee!!"}
{"text":"Our Server Nicole was the best!  She was so sweet and service was great!  Food was AMAZING!  BaNana Nut Muffin is my all time favorite!!! Will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great price and atmosphere.  Love to take my daughter there. Great staff too!"}
{"text":"Finally...I tried lunch at Egg Work's . Hard to pull away from the awesome skillets. But wowa how satisfied we were. Veronica helped us decide giving great service and recommendations.  I had a veggie on ciabatta sandwich that was fresh and nice, with a great potato salad.  My husband enjoyed his rueben and went crazy over the fries... We look forward to our next trip in."}
{"text":"great breakfast,  i had chocolate chip/butterscotch chip pancakes. my companions had western omelets,  Our server was donna and she was terrific!  We will be eating there again soon."}
{"text":"The food was great. Lots of real cheese, not cheese sauce, on my 3 pigs omelette. Our server Ethan was amazing. We particularly appreciate that he mentioned you can get a half order of things, which is great, because we have normal appetites and don't need a whole box of leftovers. When we received the bill, we were also pleasantly surprised that the price was reasonably less than the whole sized prices listed on the menu."}
{"text":"I normally don't take the time to leave reviews, but the service was too exceptional to stay silent. Candice is the greatest. Friendly, quick, and makes you feel right at home. I mean, how great must the service have been to make a lazy guy like me to write a review? The friend I was with write his first review because of Candice's service. That must say something about our dining experience.  Oh, and the food was great too, only eclipsed by Candice's friendly service."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Had the Corn Beef Hash,  homemade, awesome flavor. First visit, Adanely, our server was great. Definitely a favorite."}
{"text":"Our friends turned us on to this spot, the food the service the everything was amazing!!! Everybody tried something different, portions were huge and everyone was more than satisfied, we now need a forklift to take us back to our vehicles! Definitely will be back next time we visit no doubt!"}
{"text":"This place is really good!! The food is too much though for my stomach..which is a personal problem that has nothing to do with this place, but yes its good LOL"}
{"text":"By far the best place to not only eat breakfast but to grab a burger at lunch. I love the omelettes here. Every so often I'll indulge in one topped with their amazing chili. This place is family friendly and the service is outstanding. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Here's to helping Candice get a free trip to Disneyland. This is our first visit to Eggworks and she did a great job at making it a pleasurable experience.   The food was great. My wife had a Chili Relleno Omelette and I had a standard Chili Omelette. The portions are generous, so much so that my wife had to use a take home box. The breakfast's here are well worth getting off the Strip to come enjoy."}
{"text":"I've been to their location off Eastern, but I am so glad to have this location closer to where I live. Every single time I go in, the place is packed but the wait is never more than 20 minutes. For a lady with my appetite, waiting is a tough game.   What is great is that even while packed, they do a fantastic job of turning tables while not making you feel rushed. As always, the food is on point and their specials are always DE-LISH! Always GET THE BANANA MUFFIN! Don't ask. Just do it.  This location is also great because of it's close proximity to the 215 AND all that fab shopping across the street. Egg Works really does have their stuff together. Love this place!"}
{"text":"They have the best Banana Nut Bread and have a variety of different breakfast foods and lunches. This place holds wonderful memories and yummy food!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, but -- TOO MUCH! Really -- do you need a four egg omelette? My friend asked for and got a smaller omelette, but still left part. I got a traditional breakfast -- eggs with sausage and potatoes. All was good, BUT my plate was swimming in grease. Really. There was no reason for this. Yes, they were very busy, but can't the cook take another moment to lift the sausage (three large sausages) out of the pan and drain them -- put them on a paper towel  or something -- for a moment before plating them? It was really off-putting.  If you are a construction worker and need a huge pile of food to start the day, this is the place for you. Ridiculously gargantuan portions."}
{"text":"Candice was awesome! She was very attentive to the tables allergies and had a great sense of humor. Candice was also helpful in picking a meal when I asked about waffle batters. The food was good as always! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Eggs were very plain and tasted like they came out of a carton. The potatoes were too salty and tasted like they came out of a freezer bag. The portions were huge though. The orange juice was cheap tasting and not freshly squeezed. The food reminded me of cafeteria food. The staff were very friendly and the room was nicely decorated. It was very busy so many do like it but not a place I will visit again."}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint in Vegas. Had the traditional Eggs Benedict. Delicious as always. Ethan, our waiter, did an excellent job!! Will definitely ask for him again, the next time I come!"}
{"text":"Delicious meals and great service. I always get the Benedict, but finally tried the Island Favorites and it did not disappoint! Banana Nut Muffin really is as good as everyone says it is. Only downside is I've never been here and it NOT been busy, but it doesn't ever take long to get seated. Really good breakfast spot."}
{"text":"The food was great and our server Perry was amazing! He will even help you with trivia"}
{"text":"I don't know why people eat here and think it's good?we had a 2 for one coupon and ate here.we sat down and after 5 minutes had to flag girl down to get something to drink.terrible service.we ordered their benny's.we knew from last time not to order their diablo potatoes they taste like eating cardboard so got hashbrowns.our breakfast comes the hashbrowns are frozen cakes like ya get from mcdonalds or arbys!!!! this is suppossed to be a restaurant not fast food. the \"eggs benedict\" canadian bacon was thick and from a can!!!! worst eggs benedict I have ever eaten!!!! we knew not to order any mexican eggs cause we both remember how bad they were.even with the 2 for one coupon wasn't worth it.we will never go back.there is nothing on the menu that we think is any good.ingredients they use is same as fast food and that's better and cheaper. lousy restaurant"}
{"text":"I really like this place it has a great variety of breakfast options even if u are feeling like some lunch they have a great loco moco with a homemade sausage gravy just yummy  The only thing I would say it's a bit slow on service but who can blame them they are always really busy so be prepared to wait but it's worth it"}
{"text":"I have being there with my supervisor and the food is great and I took my family and my kids love the quesadillas I hardly recommend amything but this is good"}
{"text":"I always get the Piggy Skillet. Bacon, Ham, Sausage, potatoes, cheese & over easy eggs.. So amazing & just under $10.  This is our casual breakfast spot, at least once a week."}
{"text":"Always busy but worth the wait! We are weekenders, and they're always fast and friendly! We enjoy the ambiance because having a toddler, it's not too easy to go out and about for breakfast, however, they're always super accommodating and never mind if he makes a mess! Lots of other families with kiddos too!"}
{"text":"Would be 5 stars but they had offensive/racist country music playing. The coffee was a bit weak as well. Also, the booth tables are tiny... They give you two large waters and a carafe of coffee to go with the immense condiment carrier all on a 24\"x36\" table plus your food. The food was great though, and service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Please send Dolly to Disney.... She was very friendly & inviting... We enjoyed quick service & great food.. She made Egg Works feel like the happiest breakfast place on Earth..."}
{"text":"Food is exceptional! Best breakfast in Las Vegas complete with mimosas! The skillet breakfasts are huge but set a great base for a Las Vegas vacation!  Donna is the best server! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place had truly delicious food.  Had a benny, a California crepe and eggs to order.  Was really impressed with the rate of service, friendliness and the quality of food.  Danielle the waitress was awesome.  The place has character and good music, and you also get a free muffin for checking in on Yelp."}
{"text":"Great service provided by Candice. Food was great and well priced. Will definitely be back when in town."}
{"text":"Yay!  Tely is working the counter today! She is a fantastic server. She makes breakfast a truly wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Excellent service from Jenilee, Mel and the rest of the crew! Fantastic food - Egg-zactly how I ordered it! Glad we came here and we will be back!"}
{"text":"For breakfast food it's just alright. Nothing too unique or out of the ordinary but good solid traditional menu items. The food wasn't bad but I have to say I couldn't get over the interior. It was uncomfortable to be in there. It feels more like a truck stop restaurant in the Midwest than a breakfast spot in a suburb."}
{"text":"Had a great late breakfast today. Delicious banana but muffins, omlettes came out perfect and Rob was excellent with customer service. We'll be back thanks!"}
{"text":"Donna is awesome! Very attentive and friendly. I will always ask for her when I go to Eggworks."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years. As a local, I can say that this is one of the better places to catch an early breakfast, or brunch. Seating is quick, food is out at a timely manner. The staff is friendly, and attentive.always a pleasure. Thank you Ashley H! Great service skills! Someone give that girl a trip to Disneyland!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast that I have found in Vegas.  The blueberry pancakes are to die for!  Even their coffee is good.  We have never had bad food and have been pleased with everything we've ordered.  Servings are substantial and the service is usually very good.  This place is always busy, so you do have to be patient."}
{"text":"My daughter so funny... I was complaining I needed a refill and she goes here mom and changes the happy face on the table to a sad lol this place normally has good service, but when it gets busy it goes south... The banana nut muffins are to die for though!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, good price, excellent service!  This place feels like a locals secret.  My wife and I had breakfast here today.  The portions are huge and reasonably priced.  If you're lucky, you might get seated in Nicole's section.  She was super helpful!"}
{"text":"Super good breakfast. We had the Works Skillet.  Maria provided us with excellent service and personality. We will comeback again while visiting this week."}
{"text":"Shout out to Dona for providing excellent and uplifting service to us when we visited Egg Works! The food was extremely good in taste,smell, appearance, texture, and quantity. We will recommend Dona and Egg Works to our Waze and other social media associates!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to meet up with friends, catch up, and have amazing food.   My fav is the Loco Moco, and the avacado bacon omelette, and the waffle, and of course the banana nut muffin!  OMGoodness! The muffin!!"}
{"text":"Family friendly, price is right for good food, and everyone makes you feel welcome!  Ask for Candice - she's the best!!!!"}
{"text":"This place use to be the go to for breakfast.. the last time wasn't very good but still gave it another shot this morning and the food was disgusting.. salt with extra salt... pancakes were still raw in the center and when I talked to the manager she explained how things were my fault.. and wanted a cookie for the fact that she \"comped\" the pancakes we didnt even eat.. thank you so much for not making me pay for food you guys messed up and we didn't eat"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone! The banana but muffin was delicious! My meal was to die for. I got the cinnamon raisin French toast. It came with turkey sausage and scrambled eggs. Everything was so good. I thoroughly enjoyed the food. The waitress was really nice and courteous too. Kuddos to her as well. I'll be back for mor fore sure!"}
{"text":"EGGS!!!  Excuse me for the exclamation, but I do love eggs with a passion.  For that reason alone, having the word \"Egg\" as part of an establishment's name is usually enough to lure me in.  I can't really comment on wait times for a table, as I usually come by my poor lonesome self and sit at the counter with a magazine or the paper, but there is usually no wait for the counter.  The staff is fast and attentive, almost immediately getting my drinks as I sit down.  They have a couple of televisions above the counter, one on sports and the other on news.  Each table and counter seat has a flip egg for when you need service.  The egg with the smiley face on it (it's actually a pretty creepy smiley face, the kind of face that says \"hey baby wanna leave with me tonight?\") means everything is well.  The egg with the frowny, constipated looking face means you need attention, and the one time I had to use this they were extremely quick to respond.    Most of them items on the menu have eggs (dur), and the portions are very large.  Omelets are made with four eggs instead of three.  I usually order the Three Pigs, which is an omelet with cheese (usually order without it though to decrease the fattiness), sausage, ham and bacon, served with either fried potatoes and toast or banana nut muffin.  The Omelet itself is amazingly delicious and the potatoes tasty with this seasoning they drizzle over it.  I usually order toast, as I really don't care for the banana nut muffin.  Random quirk: The door to the bathroom is built to look like an outhouse!  Cute looking, but still retaining the functionality of modern plumbing!  The food is a bit pricey, but you generally get what you pay for.  If you live in the southwest part of the valley, you owe it to yourself to check this gem out.  PROS: Eggs, eggs, and more eggs!  Big portions for you egg lovers Fast and attentive and friendly wait staff. Flip egg so you can call for service without looking awkward  CONS: A bit pricey.  THE VERDICT:  A great place to go on a semi-regular basis."}
{"text":"I drive to this location for the amazing banana nut muffin. The food is goo too, but that moist, warm muffin is beyond delicious! I usually order the sundance special, but I figured I'd eat a little out of the \"healthy\" venue and had biscuits and gravy.  It was a lot of food! I was unable to finish it, maybe because I stuffed a muffin... I mean \"tasted\" a full muffin before the main course ;) Ricky our server was awesome!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! This place has a great variety of amazing dishes. Really hit the spot and very affordable. Outstanding service from Jay. Delightfully pleasant and energetic attitude! Definitely on top of his game. Thanks for a great experience Jay! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"No better breakfast than the chili and cheese omelet,  especially when served by DONNA!!!!  Did I mention DONNA?    Best breakfast place in town.   And DONNA!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and so was the service.  We had the banana nut bread French toast with a side of sausage patties and the special with eggs turkey ham steak and potatoes with banana nut muffin.  We took home leftovers was so much food.  You have to try the hot sauce on your potatoes it's so good! This will be our go to from now on don't sleep on this place.  We went to the Sunset/Eastern location."}
{"text":"Excellent service from John this morning. Found a delicious secret menu item and enjoyed a beautiful morning on the dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat for breakfast, the omelettes are outstanding and even if it is packed with people you hardly ever wait to be seated. Service is usually good but when I was there for breakfast today I ordered not my usual but wanted to try some blueberry pancakes... I are maybe a quarter of them until I couldn't take it anymore.. no taste what so ever and we're a \"heavy\" pancake, no amount of coffee or milk could help me choke these down... from now on I will stick with the omelette"}
{"text":"I love this place and so do my kids. I always feel welcome in this place and they always treat my kids and me like we are special to them. It's the kind of great service that you just don't find many places anymore. Their food is so great too. I have not tried anything on the menu that I didn't love. You have to go here at least once for the banana nut muffins. When they ask, if you want toast or the muffin. Trust me. Take the muffin."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in town. Everything I've tried here is delicious. You really can't go wrong. My favorite is the Bandito scramble: a mix of chorizo, jalapeno, and eggs, topped with sour cream and salsa.  Here's what separates Egg Works from the rest of the pack:  1. the potatoes. I prefer potatoes over hash browns 9/10 times. I don't know what kind of seasoning they put on these things, but like Terry P. said, they're like crack. 2. coffee creamer. I don't know if this is available at other places, but here they offer flavored creamer to go with your cup o' joe. I really appreciate this because I like my coffee \"girlie\". 3. the banana nut muffin. Warm. Delicious. And that muffin top... Just go have one. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"HoOoray for a closer egg works location!  If you love the other locations, you'll certainly love this one.  The food is the same, except for a few new items, like pizza.  One waitress informed us of a woodfire oven they had installed in the kitchen and gave us some samples to try of the Margherita pizza.  I was kind of skeptical.  But the pizza, I must admit, was pretty darn good.  The crust was thin and crisp and I especially loved the moderate chunks of sweet garlic throughout the slice.  She said they were still experimenting, so I wonder if they changed it.  I sure hope not though!  So come here to get your usual breakfast fav or to try out their new pizzas."}
{"text":"We used to go to the \"other egg\" place :) but since moving farther away from that side of town we started giving Egg Works a try and have been loyal ever since!   Coffee is good and I like how the table gets their own carafe so we don't hafta wait around for topping off our cups (much appreciated in the morning). I don't think I've ever had a bad meal there and I try to get something new every time, this last time I had their special with potato skins filled with egg, cheese, bacon pieces and topped with sour cream! Sooo good & soooo guilty :-) but hey, breakfast is the most important meal of they day right?!? Banana nut muffins are very tasty but I DO miss the coffee cake sometimes from.. Ah hem Jk   Staff is always friendly and fast. We love it!"}
{"text":"Got the Cabo Breakfast Burritto and it was fantastic.  Even during the brunch rush the food came out quickly and deliciously.  The seasoned potatoes were crispy and hot and they have a fantastic selection of hot sauces.  The house salsa is a great dark one with a zesty kick.  Price isn't super cheap, but it's very reasonable.  Plus the waitstaff is kind, attentive, and quite pleasant."}
{"text":"Donna was great! Super nice and attentive. Loved the firecracker special. Will be back."}
{"text":"Banana nut muffin, mimosa, and stuffed French toast, who could ask for more?   We had a party of 6 and our waitress Candice was phenomenal such a great place you should come if your in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Our server, Alex, was great. I have been to this location several times and have always had wonderful service. Today was the first time for lunch. It was excellent, as usual. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great service and omelets. Very happy to find this place. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. My girlfriend's meal was prepared incorrectly, but they remade it promptly. I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"This place is hopping with happy employees. Our server is VERY nice and cheerful and did an excellent job of explaining the menu."}
{"text":"Love the banana nut muffins!!! Service is always good and so is the food. Veronica was our server today and made us feel very comfortable;  she is a very happy and cheerful person. What an amazing breakfast experience this morning."}
{"text":"Awesome food! One plate enough for two. Will definitely be back. Decent prices and great service! Our waitress was wonderful! My server was Dolly :)"}
{"text":"Nothing really spectacular but nothing bad about this place either.  Just your usual breakfast place.  Will be back if I ever get up early enough for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and family friendly. Thank you for the great experience Roslin."}
{"text":"First timer at Egg Works.  Great food, great service. Deanna did a great job, very friendly, very attentive! I recommend the Country Fried Skillet, a bit salty, but delicious!"}
{"text":"Just had a delicious works skillet and some fruit at egg works. The banana nut bread muffin was very tasty. The works skillet had all the best am ingredients and the scrambled egg was light and fluffy. With a great selection of fresh fruit added to it for a little bit of healthy added in. The server Alohalani did a great job of keeping up with us. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. The food is yummy the service is fast. My son loves the works potatoes and just the overall environment is pretty chill. Really good for families with kids. Very kid friendly.  Have been here over 50 times and i still cant find anything to complain about."}
{"text":"We just LOVE it here. Professional rmployees and great good, always clean and comfortable. So happy we met our server Christian for the first time and he was super and kind and so efficient. The food is always amazing....thanks so much for being in our neighborhood"}
{"text":"My sister, wife and I all enjoyed an amazing breakfast. Chile relleno omelette was great, awesome banana bread muffins awesome fresh baked, and Roslin our server was great!  We always eat here when we visit family in Vegas."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.. food was ehhhhh. Potatoes were way too salty ,stuffed French toast were really soaked in whipped cream and stuffing..made it all soggy Had better"}
{"text":"I went to egg works for the first time and it was amazing. The food tasted so good. Banana muffins were homemade and fresh. Victoria was my waiter she's awesome."}
{"text":"Stopped in here last week for breakfast and was disappointed. It is not the outstanding breakfast place that I was let to believe. The banana nut  muffin was not even close to those served by Mimi's.  Their omelet was not fluffy at all and fell short of those served by The Farm Aliante or the Cracked Egg"}
{"text":"CHRISTIAN was our server. Very nice, respectful, funny, and knowledgable.   I ordered the corned beef dish and it was by far the most delicious dish I have had for breakfast (it was a special skillet not the omelet)   I will dine here for life!"}
{"text":"We come here every time we are in town....CAITLIN is the best!!! She definitely deserves to win the Disney trip."}
{"text":"We were a party of 6 this morning.  Mario was our waiter!!!!  Mario was so kind and patient.   We have always had excellent service at Egg Works, but Mario went above and beyond what we expected.  Our glasses were always full, the coffee flowed freely and his chair side manner and humor is fantastic!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but they messed up one of our orders 2x! Eventually they got it right but had to take it back twice, and even though my friend asked if she could at least hold on to her fruit, the server took the whole plate in a huff. She seemed more concerned about how the kitchen messed up than with how inconvenient it was for us to keep waiting for the right order. It's in a strip mall with a bunch of dental / medical offices and we were on the way to Red Rock, so not bad considering."}
{"text":"Finally, a breakfast joint that just gets it.  They have a sense of urgency to get you seated and fed.  We love coming here and it has become our go to for breakfast and now even lunch.  We usually sit at the counter for breakfast and for some lame reason I can't remember the girls name that takes care of the counter but always does a great job and is always smiling and pleasant.  We have been coming here for about 3 years now and just recently ordered lunch one day and LOVED it.  Now we hit it up for lunch and avoid the large crowds but someday soon, lunches will probably catch on and there will be crowds.   Consistant food always quick and hot.  LOVE IT!! Thanks Egg Works team!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast food!!! Im originally from california and im used to going to IHOP and Dennys for breakfast so this was amazing compared to cali places. They have amazing potato and fries. I love their seasoning...salty but sooo good. I ordered a waffle with strawberries and cream, bacon, 2 eggs for less than $10! I think thats a great deal. The only downfall is waiting for a table. Overall awesome breakfast place...u must go!"}
{"text":"Banana bread french toast.  Absolutely phenomenal.  Our waitress Ali was incredibly attentive and great at helping pick out some of their best dishes.  I would recommend to any visiting vegas for breakfast."}
{"text":"Service and food were great!!!  Make sure you request Donna as your server she is awesome !!!!"}
{"text":"Every good breakfast joint in town will at some point have a wait, but the breakfast is worth it.  Large menu and efficient staff.  Try the French toast sandwhich!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place for locals in LV! I recommend the Cincy chili omelette. Especially if you already know & love the glory that is Cincy chili. Their potatoes & fries are amazing. Do yourself a favor & try this place if you're looking for a new spot for breakfast/lunch. I'm in love!"}
{"text":"Came to this location for my first time and as seated a gentleman named ROB came rite over took care of us hands down amazing service thanks egg works and Rob we need more people like this in the food industry I'll be back in a heart beat"}
{"text":"I had the Loco Moco. Better than when I was in Hawaii. Our server Perry was great too! We love to come here anytime we are in town"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on a Sunday like every other person in Henderson. We waited about 25min for a table for two outside. This place is ALWAYS crowded which you know that means it will be worth the wait. They have plenty of shade and misters outside if the weather is bearable. The patio here is pet friendly which you don't find often in Henderson.   My husband was craving biscuits and gravy and a bloody mary and he was satisfied that Egg Works had both. I on the other hand was craving a few things on their menu so I opt'd to order a few side dishes; cincinnati chili cup, turkey sausage, and a side of eggs ( 'not really a breakfast but it was all delicious) . They have their own hot sauce here a green and red that you can buy at the front which I was a huge fan of."}
{"text":"Our server Shantel was the best! She was on top of everything and one of the best servers  I have ever had at a restaurant thank you Shantel!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We have been coming here for years on the weekends. Food is always spot on. Service is great. It is busy on the weekends but worth the wait. We have moved to a different part of town but still come back to the one on Sunset because we love the staff there. Candice rocks.  Banana nut muffins are to die for. Warm with melted butter."}
{"text":"Consistently above avg. we go here all the time and we know what we're getting. The potatoes are great, nicely seasoned but packed with MSG. Biscuits and gravy are solid never clumpy and eggs are always cooked right, and I am a self proclaimed egg snob. I hate that the menu is on a thin piece of newspaper but understand its part of their farm like theme"}
{"text":"Egg works is truly the best breakfast place in Las Vegas without question. Always 5 star food and 5 star service. Especially when you have Tamara as your server at the West Flamingo location! She is amazing at what she does. If you come here you have a %100 chance of getting a meal you like because there is nothing bad on the menu. I have eaten here easily 100 times and will be back 1000 more!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday, and literally every walk of life was there. From church goers, to hungover twenty somethings. It looked a little grim at first with there being about 20 people waiting, but we had a table in 5 minutes. I think it's because we came a little but later at almost 11, but once we were sat the place was still pretty busy.   I have to hand it to them though, it was slammed and the customer service was still great and we really didn't have to wait very long to get our food. I ordered the chicken fried steak which was pretty awesome, but the main attraction here is the potatoes. I dunno what they use to season them, but it was nothing I'd had at breakfast time before. I'll go back, for sure."}
{"text":"awesome staff! they really care about the customers and their orders to make sure that they are to their liking as ordered! i'd recommend to everyone! our waitress ashley...awesome!"}
{"text":"I have always liked this place. The service is great and the food is always awesome. However, my last visit I had the The Works Skillet Breakfast and I was a bit disappointed. I felt cheated because there was hardly any meat. It was basically potatoes, cheese and veggies. I would have just ordered the regular breakfast with sausage or bacon. It was still very tasty just missing more meat."}
{"text":"This place is always crowded. There is always a line when I come here , especially on the weekends. One of the best skillet breakfasts I have ever had. I had the \"Works\" skillet breakfast. The potatoes were very crisp and everything works well together. The flavor was awesome. I also had the spinach Benny! Very flavorful hollandaise sauce.  Service was great.  I will be back.  They have great bloody Mary drinks."}
{"text":"After seeing such high ratings for a breakfast place in my area I finally decided to give Egg Works a try. The service is great, everyone is very friendly! The food is underwhelming. I had a standard veggie omelette which comes with habla diabla potatoes. These are basically season salt covered diced potatoes which are a bit over powering. I must say that the banana muffin is delicious though. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here the high star ratings are over inflated for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place! Highly recommend strawberry cream cheese stuffed French toast. Great service from PK- dude is infectiously happy! And love the new toy train making the rounds"}
{"text":"Friendly service, always! Thanks Karen! She has helped us a couple of times even though we've only been there a few times since we're from Southern California. Great banana bread and Loco Moco! Different styles, but Hawaiian is the better one! Fresh coffee at your table! Check the front for their specials!  Be early during the weekends because it gets packed even though it's a good-sized restaurant."}
{"text":"They serve the best banana muffin in town! It's super moist and served warm. Make sure you check in thru Yelp to a get a free muffin. Their Summerlin (Town Center) location is big, lots of tables inside and outside so the wait time is not too bad.  Dogs are allowed if you sit outside which is super cool."}
{"text":"As someone who can live with coffee for breakfast and nothing else, for me to crave breakfast food can only mean one thing...this place is bomb.   The portions are massive and for some of them they allow half orders, a life saver for someone like me, with eyes always bigger than my stomach. The skillets are great mainly because they include the breakfast potatoes, that are unlike any other I've had. So great! I have a love affair with eggs benedict and it does not disappoint here. The banana nut muffins are a work of art for your mouth and usually warm from the oven. YUM.   Maybe the best part about this joint is the cute little egg on the table. You turn it to a sad face if you need anything at all, and the servers practically break their necks running over to you when a sad egg is spotted. The place gets busy but it's pretty big so the wait goes fast. There are plenty of TV's too, usually on news or sports. So get out of bed and get over there!"}
{"text":"Friendly local place where everyone working there is having fun. I had a breakfast burrito which was very good. If you want to try something else other than expensive Strip food give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Excellent place! The prime rib benny and the stuffed french toast stand out as my favorites! If you're a health freak, don't cry because it's \"unhealthy\", stay at home and make a shake or something then. We don't want you. This place serves LARGE portions, so you'll never leave hungry! Health nuts bother me."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. They make their eggs taste insanely good. I've never had eggs anywhere else taste even remotely as good. The banana nut muffins are a must have. They are so buttery and they just melt in your mouth.  They have an awesome sausage patty that is like old school mcdonalds on crack. They also make a delicious BLT"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast if your real hungry (the food is rather heavy).  I had the mushroom & cheese omelet this morning, was pretty good.  The seasoned potatoes were so so, kinda dry but edible.  The banana muffin was moist and delish.  Despite it being rather crowded, service was great, staff was frendly and we didn't have to wait long for a table, love that!  It can get rather loud so if your looking for a quiet place for breakfast, probably not the best choice.  We didn't mind the noise a bit, probably cause we were one of the tables being loud ourselves, hehe."}
{"text":"The place is jammed with locals, not tourists, and that is always a good sign. You will probably have to wait, but the food and service are worth it."}
{"text":"Having a smile early in the morning with a great breakfast...nothing like it! amazing place: attentive server , friendly folks everywhere and great food! Thanks Diana!"}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict was drowned in too much  hollandaise and it was bland.   Vanilla cappuccino tasted like it was from a 7-11 machine and not freshly made. Also, it was served in a run of the mill diner coffee mug.   The potatoes are seasoned with nothing more special than Lawry's seasoning. I can make better seasoned potatoes at home.   Service was quick. The wait wasn't long. Parking was easy.   It was packed so I'm sure there are better things on the menu but I'm not sure I'll be back to find out."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for new breakfast places and have never been to Egg Works so don't know if they are all the same but really enjoyed our breakfast here. The restaurant was very roomy with plenty of flatscreens with different sports channels or the news on. The menu was pretty extensive and styled after a newspaper( very cute!) The problem with me and new places is I love to read menus and if you give me a large one..could be a while before you get my order( plus i start to panic somewhat with the overwhelming amount of choices) so i buckled under the pressure and just got a basic 2 eggs over with bacon and potatoes with the banana muffin. Love love love the muffin! Came out warm with slightly toasty edges with great banana flavor! So yum. Hubby got a breakfast skillet with ham, mushrooms and cheese with 2 eggs over easy. Eggs were done perfectly and he seemed to enjoy it and said he would order it again. My eggs were also cooked perfectly and bacon was yummy (when is bacon not yummy?) the big surprise was the potatoes..diced very small and crispy with some seasoning i couldn't place right away. Then my husband said it tasted like bbq potato chips! Bingo thats what they tasted like! So so good. The service was also awesome ..very attentive. They have a cute little egg sign u flip over if you need anything and someone is over at your table in like 5 seconds! Love that! A neat feature to this place is they have a small arcade in the back with 3 pinball machines and a few video games. They had Addams Family pinball which happened to be one of my husbands favorites! Of course the challenge was on! its 50 cents for 1 game and only 75 cents for 2 players (bargain) . What do you guys think happened? Of course I let him win! ( men and their fragile egos you know! haha :)"}
{"text":"The Eggs Benedict featured a fantastic Hollandaise sauce, and our server was efficient.  Good breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Zzzzz. I had dined here and at Flamingo several times in the past, but my most recent visit was noticeably different.   Their breakfasts are dull and bland. The menu is extensive, but their kitchen lacks the talent to create any interesting or satisfying meals. Why no hash browns at breakfast? Why the need to season and garnish everything with paprika? The house potatoes tasted processed and are diced like a chiclet.   The service is usually pleasant and efficient, but that becomes as unmemorable when the food is flavorless.   Save your money and keep looking."}
{"text":"Always a great breakfast!! Beautiful tattooed women serving killer food how can that be bad?"}
{"text":"EggWorks Sunset is our favorite place.for lunch or Brunch.  And Candace  is a fantastic server !.  She has always been so upbeat and friendly,  even when she thought she might lose her beloved little son . Fortunately he's now recovered and  doing great, but she showed such professionalism, during that difficult time,  I was in awe."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good price...We both had the Sundance omelet made with egg beaters.  It was awesome and huge.  The servers only come over when you flip the egg stand over, so there were there when you needed attention and left you to your conversations when you didn't. It was a good experience. I'd totally eat there again and take others with me."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast joint off the beaten Vegas path. Not a banana fan at all, but loved their muffin.  Huevos rancheros were top notch and beyond filling!  Left half the plate there was so much food. I wish I lived in the area because I would brunch there weekly just to try one of everything on their huge menu.  Bookmarking this place so I make it back on every Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Food and service are outstanding EVERY time we come here. Manuela, our server, was friendly and fast. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast @ egg works. Food was awesome as usual! Brady was very attentive and funny. Never had to worry about anything.   Hubby got the mashed potato omlete.. 4 eggs, garlic mashed potatoes, bacon, chives, cheddar jack cheese served with a mound of \"works potatoes\" and muffin or toast. Hubby got the banana-nut muffin. The works potatoes are seasoned diced potatoes.    I got the veggie skillet.... layer of \"works potatoes\" fresh spinach, tomatoes, 2 eggs over easy. I left off the onions and had the cheddar jack cheese on the side. Comes with fruit slices and choice of toat or muffin. I opted for dry wheat toast and added whipped butter later so I could gauge how much was on the the toast."}
{"text":"This spot is Absolutely one of the best places in Las Vegas! The service was impeccable! I had one of the best servers I've ever had! I believe her name was Tamara, She was great with the menu and I told her It was my first time and that I wanted a good salad. She suggested the Southwest Chicken Salad! It was Amazing! Definitely going back the next time I'm in town!!!! Egg Works You Rock!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend love this place for breakfast! It's always delicious and never fails to satisfy his hunger for breakfast food. Even mine, even when I don't crave breakfast like he does.  The service and staff is always super friendly and my coffee cup is always filled and always asked before filling if I would like more.  I have only gone a few times but I know it's always a good choice.  I love their seasoning on the potatoes probably my favorite part. And the skillets are amazing since that's what I usually order."}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast spots. Good food and decent prices. We always have great service. Our sever, Victoria, was awesome. She was super patient when we were being indecisive and made some good recommendations. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome. I highly recomend Loco moco if you like hawaiian style. I also enjoyed breakfast menu which my other parties ordered and shared together. Two tips: you have to expect of waiting for15-20 minutes(worth it), potatoes as a side on the plate is seasoned and salty(tell them light seasoning or without)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend, puppy and I had a wonderful late breakfast today at Egg Works. Yes, that's right. I said my PUPPY! They have a dog friendly patio, which is absolutely awesome! They even have little water bowls sat out for the pups. Bambi was our server and she was a delight.. very prompt, friendly and attentive! The manager Monica was also super amazing! The food is always incredible and being able to bring your dog to breakfast is just icing on the cake. The excellent food and excellent service make this my favorite breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"The breakfast experience I received today was top notch! Our server was on point with everything! He had great anticipation for our needs even without us asking. He even offered to make us ginger ale since they didn't serve it. Brady, went out of his way to make sure we had a great morning, I would come back to this location just for the great service alone. Thank you Brady!"}
{"text":"Great staff. Quick and Great food. Very low waiting time. Simply VERY good food and VERY nice staff."}
{"text":"My friend and I had breakfast on 10/17/14. The food was great and Brandt was even better.  I will definitively go back!  Michelle"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is AWESOME!!! Bruce was my server, he was very cheerful, and always glad to get anything I needed.  You could tell that he really loves his job. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service as usual! Heather was our fantastic server, her smile puts you in a great mood!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best breakfast casual dining spots I have visited cause service was so great by Jennifer. She fullfilled our experience to the max. Food was awesome as well. We will be back very soon for seconds thirds fourths fifths and more. Very much pleased with everything."}
{"text":"Had great breakfast for my sister's bridal shower brunch with even better service from Donna or waitress!! Thanks for a very memorable day!!"}
{"text":"Our server Thaynara was wonderful and handled the bitch at the table next to us with patience and professionalism!"}
{"text":"Another visit to Vegas, another trip to Egg Works! This time I got the Loco Moco. I like that they give options on how to have the eggs- I got mine scrambled. Back at Cafe 100 in Hilo the eggs were usually sunny-side up, but I prefer my eggs more solid. Anyway, da bugga steh onoliscious lidat! My niece loved her mouse pancakes as usual. Thank you Cat for your great service!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday on our way out of town. The wait was supposed to be 20-30 minutes but wound up only being about 15. The service was great but the food was just OK for me (I had a waffle combo). My husband liked his BLT. I probably wouldn't go back but they were very friendly which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Melinda was our waiter and she was attentive to all our needs! Very good experience!"}
{"text":"Eating here at Egg Works in Summerlin. Sitting outside on the patio. The weather is beautiful. The food is always very good and the service is excellent. Our waiter today is John. He provides outstanding service."}
{"text":"I love Egg Works. Food is great and and the staff is awesome. Especially our server, Ray! His is so pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"Food very good and large menu.  If you want good, engaging service, ask for Christian (not from Ireland)."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this place by chance and had a great breakfast.  Service was great,  had a great meal. Comfortable, great value, good food,  generous portions.  Although we didn't have our dog with us, we had our meal outside where they have a pet friendly patio, a nice bonus for pet lovers."}
{"text":"Visited this location this morning, being from out of town I heard this local spot was extremely good. Everyone was right the food is awesome, and can I just say Nicole E. was a wonderful server. I will definitely be back whenever I'm in Vegas and will spread the word of how great it is."}
{"text":"This place was nothing short of fantastic. A cute country style restaraunt with newspaper menus!  When my son and me walked in to see a full waiting room we were surprised at how quickly we were brought to our table because the hostess was so fast. Very serious too for someone with pink hair!   Kat was our waitress and she was amazing. She was both friendly and to the point, never failing to make us smile or to fill up our almost empty cups even though she had so many other people she was helping! Never even had to flip to a sad egg, but it was so cute and silly I woulda loved to.   We were brought the banana nut muffins when we where waiting for our food and they we so good! Soft and moist. I had the omlette and it was to much to eat and the extra avacado was pricy but the best omlette I've ever eaten. Very impressed! My whole family loved there food too but no one finished there monster sized plates!  When we were leaving the blond cashier was very nice and I couldn't believe how fast and organised she was! She even had time to say good morning and goodbye to everyone when they came in or left and still ask everyone if they enjoyed there meal and smile!  Over all I would recommend this restaraunt to my friends if they want good food and don't care about all the people!"}
{"text":"I was in yesterday with my family had the best experience with our server PK plus great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on Sunday for breakfast and the food and service was outstanding!  I had the sunrise mountain and hubby had the philly benny. Both were delicious and arrived quickly to the table.  From the hostess to the server, to the employee helping us check out everyone was welcoming and friendly.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"SANTANA is amazing! Great server, this was my first time her and she blew us away! Gave us free banana muffins and recommended the chicken enchilada omelet which was to die for! Quick with our refills and very attentive."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast place with many options on the menu. Our server Robert made recommendations for the veggie egg white omelette  and banana bread toast. Both of these turned out really good. Great food, fast and courteous service.  I would definitely wanna stop by again."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast in Vegas. I was just in town for four days and we ate here twice. Service is amazing and food is fantastic!  We had our toddler with us and they were more than accommodating on getting food out for her quickly. We will be back on our next visit!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! Fast service, cheerful staff, great food, lots of options for all types of eaters.   This is one of the many times I've been here, but today our server needed a shoutout. Reina was attentive, pleasant, and made sure we were happy each minute of our meal. She's fantastic!!   Thanks guys! We'll definitely be here again."}
{"text":"Second time I've gone there for bfast, sat at the counter, and had absolutely no one serve me, nor even acknowledge my existence. Even though there were some 8-10 servers standing around shooting the breeze. Used to be my favorite bfast spot; now I won't be going back. Maybe new management, or just don't care. Sad to see."}
{"text":"Ashley is by far the best server. I only come for her ! She's kind and sweet makes us laugh. If you want a good time while enjoying amazing food go to her you won't be sorry. I'll always be back just for her service."}
{"text":"I love this place , I had friends in town last weekend and we were undecided where to go for breakfast and saw this place on our way to the strip , such a great idea, our server Maria was amazing , she explained to us the big menu you have and helped me out to choose the right dish.   I am so picky , she took the time to listen to my requests and make it perfect. And we  came back the next day !!  my friends are coming to town in few weeks and  we are definitely having breakfast again ."}
{"text":"Absolutely DELISH!! We are so happy we found Egg Works on Yelp!! Worth the drive from the Strip...extremely great value!! Our server, Patrick, was wonderful and our food came out fast and hot. HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Cabo Burrito, the Ensenada Burrito, the Spinach Benny and the Chili Rellano Omelet. We will definitely come back...thank you!!"}
{"text":"Sunday Breakfast here we come, and here we wait.... wait ... wait.... for what?  A overpriced average breakfast joint.  Yes big portions, but I do not like the breakfast potates AT ALL!  Its breakfast and to walk out paying $29 for 2 is a bit much i think for eggs and pancakes.. coffee, juice.  Ok so all you coupon folks, I get it... but I didnt have a coupon so my value for what I got was pretty big portions of breakfast food that made me wait almost to the turn of what I should have ordered lunch.    Not a place to stand in line for!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing! My favorite breakfast place on planet earth!! Came here 2 days in a row, yesterday with a party of 14 and today with 4 people!   Tamara was our waitress both days and she was lovely, efficient, patient and sweet!"}
{"text":"Donna's service was off the charts.  She greeted us with a small, very easy to talk too.  Gave good recommendation on the food and had great hair."}
{"text":"\"Let me get these plates to their table.  A second later- the check and move on to the next diners.\" (server's thoughts, maybe)   Shout out to the waiters and the waitresses- be more attentive to your customers.    As for the food, SKIP IT.  Go to Blueberry Hill.  Come off of it with the over-seasoned potatoes.  Great location if you enjoy listening to the next plane take off.  Tsk tsk."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time.  The restaurant has a nice casual atmosphere.  The menu is extensive.  They offer omelettes. French toast and homemade cornbeef hash. The portions are generous and the prices are modest.  They also offer banana nut muffins so good your lick your fingers. Great place for family and friends."}
{"text":"We love this place and come almost every week for a nice weekend breakfast. Most recently or server Donna made or visit a delight with her great service and bright attitude. We always recommend a trip here for breakfast and laughs. Get the veggie Benedict or chicken fried steak. Yoy won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Hands down...one of THE BESTBRRAKFASTS I've ever eaten!!! Wow!!! And the service was top notch, friendly, and fast!!! My new vegas must eat stop!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent everything! Great food, great prices and great service! New go to place for breakfast or lunch. Rich and Rochelle were absolutely awesome. Be back soon."}
{"text":"Heather was wonderful. Excellent fast and hot food with the best service and smiles for is this morning. We will always be back  for breakfast here."}
{"text":"Love this place! We've eaten here several times for breakfast and lunch and have had great experiences every time. Their potatoes are fabulous and their skillet breakfasts are to die for. I had the bacon and onion skillet breakfast which has breakfast potatoes layered on the bottom then bacon and onions smothered in cheese with the top layer being 2 eggs. Super yummy!!!  I definitely recommend their southwest chicken wrap for lunch, it's delicious and quite large. Comes with a side of your choice.   The service has always been excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Place is nutz! 4 of us reading the menu and the waitress, unfortunately I can't remember her name but she was excellent, asked if we'd been there before. Nope. So two minutes later she shows up with a huge banana nut muffin for us to share. It almost killed our appetites, but not quite. I can't remember what we had but it all came out as ordered and was quite good. The waitress, I think her name started with a D, gave this place an extra star."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is amazing. My personal fav are the potatoes, they are just perfect. Will be returning to egg works next time I'm in vegas"}
{"text":"Donna was amazing! Always there to help. Quick to come to service and a great attitude!"}
{"text":"The Banana nut bread muffin is amazing!!! I bought two loafs of banana nut bread to take home to share with the family. They have a wide variety to choose from on the menu. I  ordered the waffle works, as I am a waffle lover and definitely enjoyed it. My friend ordered the country benny and although it was good the eggs were over cooked and the yolk didn't ooze on to her food the way she likes it, but still tasted great. If you're in Vegas, it's worth stopping by! Great customer service as well!"}
{"text":"Great in all ways - from efficient check in/texting when table is ready, great greeters and wait staff and the FOOD.  Yummy. Highly recommend this casual, family restaurant for a low key, great breakfast joint"}
{"text":"Awesome place! One of the best omlets in America. And the bannana muffins - oh my! You have to try one. And Christopher was super nice! This place is a must."}
{"text":"Its like the other Egg Works, on Steroids.  Everything I love about the other Egg Works (nice staff, addicting potatoes, good prices) is here, and MORE!    They have arcade games for the kiddos, so you can eat your breakfast without being harassed by your child (more than you need to be).  The restaurant is clean, nice, and has comfy booths; something the other Egg Works lacks.    This place gets packed on the weekends, so make sure you bring quarters while you wait; that pinball machine isn't going to beat itself."}
{"text":"Down-home breakfast spot, very un-Vegas!  Egg Works reminds me so much of those cozy midwest diners I miss so much being in Nevada.  The prices are very reasonable, the staff is personable, and pleasant on the eye, and the decor screams of the house you grew up in.  The potatoes which accompany most of the menu items are seasoned with Egg Work's special blend of dry spices.  Some may find them a bit on the salty side, but most leave salivating for more.  Everything can be customized to your preference, and even ordered in half-portions for those without monstrous appetites.    Bottom LIne:  Great Coffee, family friendly breakfast spot always a great way to start the day."}
{"text":"Great food!  Large portions!  My eggs Benedict were cooked perfectly! And the muffins were to die for!  Thanks for the excellent service (Jessie)!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service by Donna! It was our first time here so we got a free muffins!"}
{"text":"Excellent service always have the Porkchop and eggs there always great good coffee and good times"}
{"text":"Today I'm having egg white omelette with veggies and bananas and blueberries and like always great service love it"}
{"text":"I must have ordered the wrong thing. Got the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon. Everything tastes like it was cooked on top of an abandoned salt mine. Super salty gravy, super salty potatoes, and flat gown coffee. Hit the Cracked Egg on north side of 215, much better food."}
{"text":"This is theee spot for Breakfast!!! Been coming here for years and it's always been tradition to come here for Vegas!!! I wish they had a spot like this back in Los Angeles, I would come every Sunday lol. They have literally everything you would want to eat for breakfast. I've tried most on the menu and have always been satisfied. Awesome food for a great price! You can't go wrong coming here!!"}
{"text":"We visited for the first time the other day and would return. The food was very good, potatoes were fantastically seasoned and the service was attentive, but not annoying. We loved the egg faces to be used when we needed something! One of us ordered eggs \"over medium\" but the white was really raw and runny. The server took care of it with a smile without any hesitation! :) Would HIGHLY recommend.  Visited October 2016"}
{"text":"This Egg Works has been a breakfast go-to for the gf and I for sometime.  We usually go at least once a month.  This latest visit has us thinking they will no longer be part of the rotation.  The gf went with one of her usual favs - the chicken enchilada omelet ( about $9.)  Instead of toast she opted for the banana muffin ( the star of the show - moist, dense, warm, nice flavor .)  The omelet was ....boring ( i think it's simply played out )  And the one issue we always have with the savory breakfasts - the seasoned potatoes - presumably diced potatoes thrown in the fryer then throw on some seasoned salt - no thanks !  A first for me - i bought into the menu BS that the burgers were the best in town- i went with the patty melt - simply put, it sucked.  Small over-cooked burger, the smallest piece of cheese i've ever seen on a burger and no FLAVOR.  note to self, if i ever eat at egg works again - pass on the burgers !  We do like the flavored creamers for the coffee .... that and the banana nut muffin are insufficient for a return visit.  The SW breakfast choice are limited !  pics added"}
{"text":"Candice, our server was very nice & accommodating. We didn't wait that long for our order & we were constantly updated. The Santa Fe was good. We checked in on yelp & got our free banana muffin."}
{"text":"This place really IS egg-cellent!  Everyone who works here is pleasant and genuinely seems to like their job.  Our server Andrew was attentive and helpful and really friendly.    Our food came super fast and all of us enjoyed our food, even my very picky daughter.  The atmosphere is nice and clean.  Even outdoor seating looked great, but the kids wanted to watch the model train going around the track inside.  We will definitely be coming back.  Kids menu is abundant and the banana nut muffins are amazing!"}
{"text":"This food tasted like IHOP. It was just bland. They have a huge menu. The banana nut muffins were not that good."}
{"text":"Got the works scramble. Tasted okay, but misleading description. \"Diced bacon\" should be at MINIMUM, a single slice of  bacon don't you agree? Being that a slice if bacon is the standard unit for the word \"bacon.\" Here, it means a teaspoon of bacon bits. For a $12 plate I expected better value, especially since I declined the potatoes and toast that comes built into the price. I guess you pay for the convince of not scrambling eggs, with chicken. Also, diners like this historically, offer low cost coffee. Total came to $15.64 for the food and coffee. I just wasn't feeling this experience at all."}
{"text":"Blade was our server and she was so sweet and kind , just a lovely person , she made us feel like we were her only table . I would say to ask for her when you come in . I love her .."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here.  The wait time was minimal for a busy Sunday and our server Ethan was amazing!! He was very attentive on refills of soda and coffee.  The food was perfect and I recommend the chicken fried steak and eggs.  We will definitely be back.  If you visit ask for Ethan.  He is very good."}
{"text":"Beyond over rated. Service was terrible with forgotten items and mixed up orders with food that was very disappointing. Had a cold raw skillet , thought skillets were meant to be cooked???   Will not go back again"}
{"text":"Want great food? EGGWORKS on S.Eastern, Henderson, NV is the best! Went there for breakfast...P.K. served us. He was the best! Awesome service. Island favorites is delish. Portuguese sausage & eggs. You just can't go wrong @ Eggworks."}
{"text":"The best breakfast restaurant in Vegas. My wife and I come here all the time. Consistently great food and service at a fair price. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Typical breakfast place. Huge portions and decent tasting food. Had the bacon avocado omelet, which was mainly just avocado and very little bacon.. but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Great food! you will definitely not be hungry after this breakfast. We even got up early to drive out from the strip before our meeting for a convention just to get a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Was so good the first time, we came back again. First time I had the loco moco. Not in the islands, but it was ono eats! Second time I had the veggie omelet, which was also great. Highly recommend! Thanks Heather for the great service."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast, good comfort food.  Cleaned my plate.  Have been here several times over the last month for breakfast only.    Really great about adjusting your foods..  I changed the waffle meal to pancakes, yummy!!    2 pancakes are huge and shareable.   Ask for 1/2 portion if you don't have a large appetite, it doesn't cut the cost in half, but I am not wasting food then.    And they have 1/2 and 1/2 available for coffee if you don't like those little creamers.  Also tried a skillet, was really great mix of flavors.  Love the potatoes.   Our first waitress was a little rude, but have had 2 great ones this week alone, so maybe she was having a bad day.   Great about cleaning off your table if you are done, which I find many restaurants don't do any more.   They serve Coca Cola products."}
{"text":"Every time we come to Vegas we make we stop by.  The banana muffins are the best.  Chelsea our server was great. The service is always excellent."}
{"text":"Good local spot. I wish they had places like this in LA.   I always get the original breakfast burrito. Pretty solid. Salsa is good. Comes with their potatoes (uhhmazing) and their banana nut muffin (also uhhmaazing).   I've also tried the loco moco. Pretty good if you're in the mood for something hearty.  I've also tried their skillets. Lots of potatoes and cheese. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Been to other locations and no problem with the service.  Visited this location and the service was terrible.  We were seated promptly but the wait for our server was extremely long.  It was rather busy so we can give a pass on that.  However once we placed our order, things did not improve.  My wife ordered pancakes, eggs over medium, well done bacon and decaf coffee.  I ordered the waffle with eggs and ham.  The coffee served was cold and we had to ask for replacement.  Another long wait.  When our meals arrived, her pancakes and my waffle were cold- the butter didn't even melt.  The eggs were lukewarm and best, and the bacon burnt.  Needless to say we will not be going back to this location"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. It's generally busy but you don't have to wait too long to be seated. The portions are huge and you can easily share most items. Reasonable priced and usually on Groupon.  I tried the Key Largo Crepe. It's an omelette folded in to a crepe instead of eggs. I could barely eat half. The sourdough toast is soft and banana muffins are delicious. They also sell small loaves of freshly baked banana bread.   I will definitely return to try something new."}
{"text":"food is great here, I personally never get a chance you eat inside the place and wouldn't want to. each time I come and get a to go order the employees are rude and impatencant they treat you like a to go order is an issue instead of another purchase  to Thier store. they make u sit on these two chairs that have wheel chairs and walkers piled up and no one stops for a second to see if your help.... the one dark haired lady last time pushed thru me like I wasn't standing there and didn't even say excuse me or sorry when she realized what she did... I said something to two other people and they ignored me like I wasn't talking.... I will never go in this location again sadly because the food is good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! It's right by our house and across from his gym. They make their own hot sauce and it's amazing."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating. The service was really good! If it's your first time here you get this bomb ass banana muffin. SO GOOD. Must try!  For a breakfast place, I thought the food was ok."}
{"text":"Donna welcomed us and made us believe we were her favorite regular customers. The food was delicious. Portions were big and so many choices!  That was the best breakfast I have had in Las Vegas. I recommend that you get off the Strip and enjoy. Donna will make you welcome."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast restaurant. Always busy and staff handles it great. Coffee is real good as well."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying it really pisses me off when people (Judy) misuse Yelp to make false accusations about a restaurant.  Being an owner myself, I am very conscious of my Yelp reviews and know how they can effect my business. That said people like Judy, who by the way has no following and never Yelped before suspiciously, should be acknowledged only after several shots of Tequila!! Enough said!!  First visit here with my wife, having a wonderful time. They brought us both complimentary banana muffins for our first visit, nice touch!! Service is great, staff is awesome, and the breakfast is amazing!! My wife ordered the corn beef hash which I tasted and is the best I have had. I did the tradish ham and eggs which was great!  Recommend highly!!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. Have had many great meals here. Only complaint? Cleanliness of the restaurant's tables and chairs have fluctuated throughout my many different visits."}
{"text":"Food was great as always, but we sat on the patio since it was a beautiful morning.  There were several families out there and we all were already eating.  Another couple walked in and started smoking - they were the only ones smoking and we were not the only ones it was bothering.  We asked about it being allowed and the server said she wasn't sure the situation when it was bothering other patrons so she got a manager.  Manager said she would move us inside.  So we were sitting there finishing our meal, they had just walked in and WE were the ones inconvenienced and given the \"opportunity\" to move?  Thanks, just the check please.  No apology, nothing.  I don't enjoy my morning coffee with someone else's secondhand smoke."}
{"text":"This place is SO GOOD! Loved the food, service, and Maria was fantastic. Love finding new places to dine at, and we will for sure be coming back! Plenty of options, we all got different things and didn't even scratch the surface of the menu. Thanks for everything!"}
{"text":"Generally a good consistent dining experience...morning rush hours are busy..our server today was Cece. She never let my glass get empty and was on top of her service.  Thank you for a good breakfast experience"}
{"text":"After a great Halloween, breakfast was in order. After searching we decided to eat here, and I'm glad we did! Banana nut bread was AMAZING. My friend and I bought a loaf of bread to take for the trip back home. I was expecting a cup of coffee, but they give you the entire pitcher! Service was fast. Got the pumpkin pancake, and it was a stake of 3, and each one was as big as my head!! Huge portions! My pancakes were a little dry. Great service too."}
{"text":"I went to have breakfast on a busy Sunday morning and my waiting time pleasantly short. Once in I asked them for another table do to my party size and 1 of the girls up front and another brought me one quickly and were HAPPY to do so. I then got one of the greatest servers ever her name was Tracy she was very nice, courteous, patient and explained the meals with great detail. When she didn't know didn't know a answer she took the time to go find out. Tracy was awesome and also found out she was new. Lol will be back for this kind of service. I'm part of a local mega church and will make sure they all know ehat great service I got not to mention the great tasting food. Thanks and hope this helps ! God bless everyone"}
{"text":"Egg Works in Summerlin is a wonderful find.  The staff is always friendly, we never have to wait long, and the food is great.  My family loves the Works potatoes, and I love that I can substitute fruit when I am being \"good.\"  And the fruit is fabulous - a large slice of each: three kinds of melon, plus pineapple, orange, and grapefruit.  I love breakfast here!"}
{"text":"The staff are so friendly, it makes your entire dining experience better. They even have a cute system for you to get your waiters attention. You put up the sad face egg sign instead of the smiling egg, and it really works. But now for the important part. The food! To start, we got complimentary zucchini muffins with chocolate, if I'm remembering the zucchini part correctly. Then, I had the veggie eggs Benedict. It came completely drenched in hollandaise. So much so I could not stand to eat it and sent it back. They happily brought me another with hollandaise on the side this time. It was ok. Not bad but not great still. Tim had eggs and waffle combo. He enjoyed his more than I enjoyed mine. However, their menu is large. Food portions are large. Give it a shot. You should be able to find something you like"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. We ordered from the Hawaiian specialties. Just what we were looking for. All with great service and reasonable prices. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning with family visiting from California. As always, had good food and great service by PK!!! He was friendly, professional, and cheerful. His positive and happy disposition is what this world needs more of especially with the state of our country today. Keep on smiling and spreading your positive energy, PK!  Thanks for a memorable breakfast....we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, superb service, very clean environment, friendly atmosphere, super clean Decor & restrooms. Nohemi was a great attentive server, major props to this place, it's nice to travel and have a good breakfast place with no or minimal wait. A must try."}
{"text":"My friend Christy and I had an exercise class on the other side of town, so we thought we'd stop for breakfast afterward. Although I've been to the Egg & I on Sahara countless times, I had never been to Egg Works on Sunset. Same good food, same crowded environment. And, thankfully, same awesome seasoned potatoes!  Although it was not quite 11, we both opted for lunch rather than breakfast. Christy had the reuben, and I had the Carlsbad club, which was sort of like a regular club but with the addition of avocado and the subtraction of the middle piece of bread. Christy loved her sandwich (and it did look pretty good), and my sandwich was good (not great). But we each ordered a side of the aforementioned potatoes, and that IS a great thing. I'm sure the \"secret ingredient\" to these little potato chunks is just Lawry's seasoned salt (or something comparable), but that seasoning makes all the difference.  The restaurant was crowded, but we were seated quickly and our food came out fast. They have a little egg-shaped flip card on the table so if you need service, you can turn it from black to yellow and someone will come to your table ASAP. We used the flip card to ask for takeout boxes, and they were Johnny-on-the-Spot about responding. And to top it all off, I had a BYGO Entertainment book coupon, so both our meals (with two iced teas) were under $20!  Depending on which side of town you're on, you can probably find an Egg Works family restaurant somewhere near you. And I suggest you do, if not for their myriad egg dishes, for -- what else? -- their tasty taters."}
{"text":"We come to Las Vegas with friend a couple times a year. Last time we were it this area was maybe a year or two. We came back because I remember it was good. I would say very good. Our part had a big mix this time. One traditional type with eggs toast and all the trimmings. It looked good. My friend made it disappear faster than David Copperfield. My girlfriend had the green hash it was very good. I had the Cincinnati chili very close hardcore Skyline fan may of needed a different hot sauce but all and all it was good. Not perfect but for the price and service, good value."}
{"text":"I would love to tell you about the delicious waffles. However I never goto them. I called in my order 20 minutes ahead for pick it up. When I arrived at the restaurant I was greeted friendly staff asked to go to the back counter to pick up food . After a short wait at the counter I was acknowledged.  The server who answered my phone call was more than helpful at attempting to locate my order. It was uncovered after a few minutes of asking other servers and the kitchen staff that someone else had taken it. 3rd attempt at trying to get food or service from an egg works at two other locations it's unfortunate that the same thing has happened twice now.  Three strikes and your out."}
{"text":"Our server Amy was spectacular. We had a party of 8. She kept an eye out on water level and out food came out really fast. She was very polite, friendly and I will request here when I come back to this location. Thank you AMY!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday around noon with a party of 8. Didn't have to wait long and we were seated in the room away from the main floor. It was nice because we were the last party to sit in that room so we had it all to ourselves. Our server Travis was very nice and attentive to our orders. Very accommodating and checked on us regularly. We ordered a variety things on the menu and let me just tell you, the dishes are HUGE. I ordered the corn beef hash and I barely made a dent on my plate. It came with eggs and toast and I ordered a side of white rice. The dish was very good. My kids ordered the Mickey chocolate chip pancakes which i thought was pretty cute. Even the kids portions were very generous. I will remember next time tho to just order 1 meal to split with my kids because the food was too much for us. So I would recommend have a very big appetite if you plan to come hear. Parking looks crowded but there's parking on all sides of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast spot! Love coming here for the huge servings, quality ingredients, and the Work's potatoes. Oh the potatoes!"}
{"text":"As a regular from this location, if you're looking to get full and a great experience, come here! Servers and everyone here are super friendly. If you're coming here with a family, friends, or SO's, it's all a great time! We had Cassandra help us out today and she was great!"}
{"text":"Great service, huge portions, great value, clean restaurant, heaps of parking. Donna was our server.  She was great.  Friendly, efficient and quick service.  Loved it!  We had a party of 12 so we were impressed with how quickly our food came out.  Everything tasted great."}
{"text":"Really not sure why this isn't a straight 5 star on yelp. My favorite breakfast place in the world. Amazing menu with lots of selections for both breakfast and lunch. Recommend the breakfast burrito, the country benny, sunrise mountain. Banana nut muffin is delicious.   Great service as well. Always busy, especially on the weekend at peak hours."}
{"text":"We Love Eggworks, the breakfast is always yummy, Love the Fresh Fruit!!!...The staff is always friendly & helpful it's always nice to see Linda the Hostess' smiling Face....Suzy & Maria are excellent servers to ask for if you can sit in their section....for the last 10 years it's been great experiences, it's our go to breakfast place!!!"}
{"text":"The service is excellent and the wait time wasn't too bad. Only about 10-15 minutes to get a table, which is reasonable for a weekend spot. The restaurant is clean and definitely a popular spot for breakfast since every table was filled. The food unfortunately didn't \"wow\" me. I ordered the Three Pigs omelette, which was covered with a massive amount of jack cheese. So much that the grease from the cheese puddled into one corner of the omelette.  I had to scrape most of the cheese off. I could barely taste the meat flavors and was hoping for a crunchy bacon filling with the sausage and ham. The side potatoes were a bit overcooked and over seasoned and the English muffin was drenched in butter. Maybe my stomach wasn't in the mood for lots of oily fats, because I just wasn't impressed by the meal or flavors.  I would definitely return again and try another dish. It's difficult to find a great breakfast spot, so I won't rule this place out. I unfortunately can't give it a four or five star rating like most of the reviews on here because it just wasn't that spectacular."}
{"text":"Good food...nice place to eat... Perry our server was very good attentive and did a great job..."}
{"text":"Tina was super nice and helpful with the extensive yummy menu! Food was the best we had during our vacation!"}
{"text":"Sara was our waitress and she was amazing! She was on top of her game and took care of us really well.   As for the food, it was wonderful. The banana nut muffin was nice and warm and fluffy. It was perfectly made. I got the stuffed French toast and a side of potatoes and it was delicious! The French toast was thick and seasoned just light enough that it didn't overpower the eggs it went with. And the potatoes were delicious! Everyone should try this place if they are visiting in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food is good & the service is always great! Never had a bad breakfast here, only thing I don't like is there were people smoking on the patio. There is nothing worse than trying to enjoy breakfast but having to do it while inhaling someone else's disgusting habit."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Its a cozy little cafe, with great service, and a real at-home feel.  Yummy selection and inexpensive."}
{"text":"First impression was a more \"homey\" feeling. Until the smell hit you. Not quite sure what it was just that it was very unpleasant.  After being seated the first thing noticed was every cup on the table was dirty- spots - crusted something- lipstick- the menus also crispy from what looked like spilt coffee. After scanning the menu I found the kids menu to be quite small. In that I couldn't even order and egg with a pancake! By the time the menu was being looked at the smell from the whole restaurant was so nauseating we decided the it was time to head out! I can not comment of the taste of the food we did that get that far, but the over all atmosphere and cleanliness of this restaurant was lacking heavily in both areas. I will not ever be trying this place again nor will I be recommending it to anyone. In actuality I will advise people to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Good breakfast selection ( tasty ) larger portions also few mixed drinks. ( AM Alcohol ) KUHL Employees! They even have counter for a single yelper!!!  Check out the real train rolling around the ceiling... All aboard..... JKKUHL Approved... SMILE!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and the food was awesome!! Experienced excellent service from Donna! Prices are good and portions are big, will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"I had a great time at this place and the exceptional service provided by Veronica was second to none! We were shown our seats right away and for such a busy Sunday I was extremely surprised to get such quick service from Veronica. She was courteous and very helpful when I had questions about their dishes. She brought out our banana but muffin within seconds. I was very impressed :-) and my cup of water never went empty. She seems to be very efficient with her time.   The atmosphere was inviting and you can feel all the action in the kitchen Lol I enjoyed my time in this locale and would recommend it to anyone. I also recommend everyone to ask for Veronica cause her customer service was amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Came here around lunch time for breakfast, yes I am not a morning person.  Amy served us and was both attentive and friendly.  I ordered tea but didn't like the plastic pots they are served in (depending on what you read, it can be toxic).  No problem, she brought me a metal pot instead with a smile and was very understanding.  On to the best part:  I ordered the Mexican Omelette and it might just be the best omelette I've ever had.  Chilies and jalapeños smothered with ranchero sauce and cheese, yum!  I had fruit with it, and was happy to see big slices of fresh pineapple, honeydew, cantaloupe, and watermelon.  None of that cubed fruit that's been sitting in plastic cups all morning.    Will definitely be back whenever I'm in Las Vegas, this is my new favorite spot for breakfast.  The restaurant decor also made me smile, but I'm not going to give everything away here, just go see it for yourself!"}
{"text":"The hostess Nicole is so sweet! She always had a smile on her face & really added to our dining experience (:"}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about this place. I have experienced them in both a dine in and take out situation.   When I went in for take out, they sat me down and gave me a drink while I waited. Everyone was very friendly. The food came out in no time at all. I brought the food back to work and proceeded to devour my meal.   The second experience I had was even better. After we sat down, our waitress greeted us promptly and took our drink order. She was also very friendly. After this, two other people stopped by to be sure that we had placed our drink order. Then we ordered our food and I requested the last portion be a to-go order. The waitress remembered and at the end of the meal when she gave us the check she put the order in and it was ready right before we were ready to go.   Now for the specifics.... their eggs are really as fantastic as they say. My favorite so far is the Cincinnati Chili. If you have EVER had Cinci Chili before and loved it, this is a MUST try. I'm not sure how many places have this in Vegas...  I tried the Cinci burrito. The egg in it was extremely filling and the entire thing got eaten (in twi sittings).  If you're looking for a decent priced breakfast/lunch joint - try this place out. I think you will be very happy you did."}
{"text":"Loved it! My cousins who are local brought us here and we were very happy. The banana not muffin is excellent.  The veggie skillet is excellent. The veggie crepe is excellent. The coffee was smooth and yummy. The service was on point. Definitely a place to visit."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast with a very extensive menu---seriously they have every breakfast option one can dream of, with tons of Vegetarian goodies!  Not gourmet quality but always good.  The service is great and the staff works as a team always."}
{"text":"Our random 'pajama party' Sunday breakfast was better than expected, begining at the door; our awesome server, Amanda,  recognized that we too were awesome when we came in PJ's, slippers and all.  She scooped us up, sat us in her section, tolerated my excessive pickiness and delivered us delicious breakfast perfection.   We thoroughly enjoyed her humor, bright personality, and clever ways. Such a delight to have such sparkling service early in the a.m."}
{"text":"I love this place! I live in California and every time I visit Las Vegas this place is a must at some point during my trip! Took my friends here and everyone loved it! This place is always amazing and the staff is always friendly. I plan on coming back next time I'm in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Great food! Haole Loco Moco was just fantastic as was the Santa Cruz Breakfast burrito! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Small place, clean, food is just okay, the omelet was absolutely terrible however. Undercooked egg dripping grease with 2 craft singles on top. Service is good, very attentive waiters and waitresses."}
{"text":"Haole loco and island favorite.  One of the best breakfast places in Las Vegas.  Service is quick.  Recommend going before 9:30 on weekends before it gets busy and have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"GREAT food. It's the ultimate breakfast spot. It is a great place to bring out-of-town visitors. Very good WiFi."}
{"text":"This really should be a five star review , but on a hot and busy Sunday it was still warm in the place like the a/c didn't work. But the food was great tasting !! I Had the strawberry texas French toast which was Amazing. My son had a bbq hamburger which he said was just ok, but the onion rings where on point with flavor."}
{"text":"Ive eaten at Egg Works many times and was hoping for a good experience today. Didn't happen. Seated quickly, even though it was busy was a plus, Hostess was courteous. The server, seemed ok, but I could tell that some of her surrounding tables, were agitated. (Shoulda known). Server took our order & most of the food came in a timely manner - most...The server dropped the food she had & took off - not asking if we needed anything else. I noticed my silverware had dried food debris - so I had to wait to have a staff member bring my a clean set. Also the fruit garnish - which I admit I dont usually eat - the pineapple slice was rotten (I took a pic to show I wasn't exaggerating). But the most irritating thing was that the server FORGOT to put in the order for one of my daughters so she sat for almost ten min with nothing - the server - while apologetic, didn't seem sincere. Maybe because I overheard her apologize to four other tables for similar mistakes - Heres an observation - if she would have done her job correctly in the first place - she wouldnt have to apologize. So she brings the meal - then wants to chit chat while we're eating - she just butt into a conversation that had nothing to do with her...Really??? I'm not the type looking for free things but when I make a mistake - I would comp the guest the item that was in question - instead she brings a loaf of banana bread - which we didnt order or ask for in lieu of a discount I dont get to go out to breakfast with my family often as I used to  - so it is a special event for me. So when I pick someplace for breakfast I expect something close to perfection....SADLY DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is super fast, even on weekends.  A must try location."}
{"text":"Couldn't ask for a better brunch experience on our first day in LV! Our waitress Tina was an absolute gem, so accomadating and thoughtful! The biscuits and gravy were also a great way to start the day after a very long travel day~"}

{"text":"Trying to help Ashley win a trip to Disneyland. New transplants from LA to Henderson. Hubby gives the Haole loco moco a nine because of the fresh patty and good rice and gravy. I give my corned beef hash a 6, only because I don't like peppers in mine, and they were pretty salty. I'll try the eggs Benedict next time. Good ambiance, but a bit pricy for breakfast."}
{"text":"Food was really good! Bit portions too. I got \"The works\" skillet and barely ate half especially since I had my free banana nut muffin with a check in. Heather was our waitress and she was the best! I would definitely come back here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great service and clean establishment!"}
{"text":"the Stromboli is awesome! went there today and It was so big I barely could eat half of it. took the rest home"}
{"text":"We went here Saturday morning.  Very busy We had Alexa as our server she was great and gave us great service. Like always the food was delicious !!!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service, friendly people. It tends to get crowded here but if your not with a large group just ask to sit up at the breakfast bar.. It's actually faster up there. If you like spicy stuff try anything with the Habla Diablo sauce. Great spit for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"AMAZING! It's off the strip, on the other side of the airport, but worth the 15minute detour from heading home.  Just a few points about this establishment:  1.  The entrance to the restrooms is decorated like an outhouse-disturbing, but cute!  2.  If it is your first time, they give you a delicious muffin  3.  Unlike everywhere else in Vegas, they leave the carafe of coffee on the table, and outfit you with all the sweeteners and flavored/unflavored dairy/non-dairy creamers your heart could ever desire  4.  The eggs benedict is probably the best in Vegas (not the best ever, by any means, but definitely fantastic)  5.  It's one of those \"pay at the register when you are done\" kind of places; just don't forget to leave the tip  .  That's all I got folks, so get out there and enjoy some Egg Works!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast & brunch restaurant ever been to , love the food and the atmosphere staff very friendly. I came the restaurant was full l, but got seated quickly. Second time here now, wish they have another location in Dallas."}
{"text":"A very nice spot for breakfast. Our server, Tina, is superb! She made sure we're having a great experience in this restaurant. Food is good and well seasoned. Service is excellent. Will definitely go back here whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"The service is fast and good but the food is just mediocre. Nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"When we got here there was a lot of people waiting and we checked in and sat down within 15 minutes. Not bad for a full restaraunt. Once we were seated are very attentive waitress Mary came and it was like 'BANG BANG BANG' Seriously. She was good! She got our drinks, took our orders, got a banana nut muffins and about 10 minutes or less later, our food was out at our table. How awesome was that? They are really organized or the cooks are secretly Superman or have some sort of secret powers.     The food was awesome as always! I had the California Crepe and it came with their special potatoes. I call it special because its the bomb.   My husband had the corn beef. I think it's called hashed something. That was actually really good. It was perfectly seasoned. It came with your choice of scrambled or sunny side up eggs. Oh and special potatoes.  My son had the sliced bacon and avocado omelette (well that's what my son thought he ordered. he couldn't remember the name) and I know it was good because he demolished it within 5 minutes. Not to mention those servings are HUGE!!!  My daughter had the Mickey Mouse pancakes which came with a child size drink. Their buttermilk pancakes are also as good as everything else on the menu.   Overall the good is A+ and to too it off the customer service is on point. They make it point to take care if their customers. Their was a nice lady that came by our table and asked us how everything was going. Told her that our server Mary was awesome. I like that they do that. It shows that they do care.  Kuddos guys! Keep up the great work. We will be coming by again!   BTW I thought about taking pictures but the food look so good and was so hungry that skipped it LOL"}
{"text":"Great service !!!   Too many items to choose from on the menu.   Good place for breakfast, especially since the portions are huge !!  Who needs a Las Vegas buffet, when you can fill up your belly with Egg Works cuisine.  Coffee is pretty good here, too.  Only $2.75 for unlimited coffee.     Clean restaurants, ample parking, and right off of the freeway.   Far from the strip, but if you have a car, use it and drive over.  TV's in the restuarant, too !!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Our server, Tina, was so sweet & nice. Will definitely come back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!   Our server was great.  Our food was hot and exactly as we ordered it.  You get so much food.  there is no way you can be hungry.  And the banana muffin is to die for."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing the cats pajamas I'm talking the bees knees the creme of the crop! My food was soo good I literally shed a single tear,it melted in my mouth, the service was incredible oh and I got my food within 5 minutes of ordering..Emily was my server, talk about the whole package this girl was smart funny and super attentive, everybody who works here were extremely fun and personable! All in all I'd come back for the service staff alone! Definitely deserving of all 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently awesome!  But the best part is Chelsea!  Best server ever!  I think she deserves to win a trip to Disney!  Hands down the friendliest most efficient server I've met in a long time!"}
{"text":"Caitlin was awesome!  Pleasant and quick!  Loved her!  Send her to Disney!!!!!  Oh and the food was awesome as usual!"}
{"text":"Local breakfast place in Henderson is packing customers. Love going there. Staff and servers are friendly and always have a smile on their faces. My kids enjoy the choo choo train that goes around the restaurant and food is delicious. Their signature banana nut muffin is very yummy! Menu has a lot of different variety to choose from. Definitely would bring my family and friends here, especially the ones that are visiting from out of town. Great place!"}
{"text":"I ate breakfast at the Egg Works on Sunset in Las Vegas, NV on 11/22/2014.  It was my 1st time there.  There were three of us and we were all pleased with our food.  I had their western omelette and coffee.  Plus, I took photos."}
{"text":"If you leave w/o the fried potatoes, you're missing out. Everything is so good here. Try the bandito scramble."}
{"text":"Tried Egg Works.  Banana muffin \"appetizer \" was a great way to start the day! Then we followed it up with a skillet that was made huge to share!  Ready to go take on the day! Our server Kelli was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot, and dine in a wide variety of places from fancy to dives. This place was spot on. Food was good, came quickly and the variety for breakfast was amazing. From Crepes, Benedicts,  Omelettes, Srambles, and standard fare, everything was delicious. Our server was phenomenal and absolutely on top of it. We didn't have to ask for anything from extra napkins to water to the check."}
{"text":"Stopped by Egg Works prior to leaving Vegas and it was amazing...esp the banana muffin.  Our server was Mariia, and along with excellent service, she made great recommendations.  When she found out we were also from out of town, and loved the banana muffin, she was sweet enough to pack one for the road which we thoroughly enjoyed as soon as we arrived home.  Will definitely make a trip out every time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Egg Works today for some breakfast. I have to say this was by far the best breakfast I have had in a really really long time. Eggs were amazing and fluffy. Our waitress Nicole was the best waitress, she was super nice and really prompt when it came to everything. If you go to this place make sure to get the eggs and ask for Nicole.  On a side note Genna W. that reviewed this place too is wicked hot, let me know the next time you go to Egg Works I'll join you."}
{"text":"Love the seasoned potatoes with Cholula on top, I even bought the seasoning right there at the restaurant.  I wish every restaurant offered half portions like they do.  Even the half portions are large!  The skillets are my favorite and the Chicken Cordon Bleu is the best.  I have eaten there many times and the staff is ALWAYS friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar counter today, watching how helpful & friendly the staff was to each other, feeding hungry breakfast & coffee first people, they just pull together.  Through all of these meals being prepared to different tables & types of people, I didn't see one person lose their cool, instead buttered the toast for another person's order, helped run the food out and seemed to care about getting everything right for each person.  I totally respect that.  I highly recommend sitting up there & watch how hard they work to do what they do.  Awesome Eggs Works team!    I had a friendly & very personable server named Heather who was wonderful!  I never had to look for her, she had perfect timing.  Honestly, when I'm not w/ my folks who like to sit at the table, I'm always going to sit at the bar.    Today I had the Mexican crepe, next time I'll say no onion, cheese or chiles.  I forgot cause last time it was perfect w/o all of that.  Also the guy next to me had the Works scramble.  He said that's the only thing he gets so I'll try that next time.  Hope you all are having a great morning cause Egg Works made my day."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! The food and staff are absolutely amazing! Our server Melissa was the sweetest and impressively fast despite how busy is was! We live in the anthem area and have an egg works way closer, but still find ourselves coming to the rainbow location because of how great the staff is. Have tried multiple items for breakfast and lunch and everything is good! Would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Yuuuum!  A friend brought me here for breakfast and I loved it.  I love breakfast foods and it's nice to go to different places other than IHOP and places like that.  I had the chorizo scramble or something like that and it was delish!  My bf had the corned beef hash and it's REAL corned beef!  Not the canned kind!  Haha.  Oh and they have really really yummy banana nut bread that comes w/ the meals."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday. Service was fantastic. Maggie was wonderful and quick. The waffle breakfast I order was great. I will be back. Maggie deserves to go to Disney."}
{"text":"First, the staff are friendly and helpful. I felt that they genuinely like the place, the food and the people around them. Second, the food was great! The hostess recommended the cordon bleu scramble and it was fantastic. Third the environment was clean and inviting with plenty of room to sit. I'm definitely going to make sure to come back."}
{"text":"Great selection, great food, but most of all five star service from Veronica, the sweetest Michigan native you'll ever meet! Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch doesn't matter. Just go!"}
{"text":"Got here early at 730, and it was already hopping with folks.  Our server Shantel was so gracious and made sure we had everything.  Great service and the food hit the spot after a five hour flight to Vegas."}
{"text":"My parents came for the first time here and our waitress Ashley treated us excellent and took the time to explain the menu. Great food, great service... We are coming again for sure. Thanks Ashley!"}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly service. What more can you ask for?? We are from out of town and found this on Groupon. What a great place. Highly recommend the banana nut muffin.  I got the classic breakfast. Eggs were perfect. The diablo potatoes had a nice little kick to them.  Check this place out if you're in the area!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast at Egg Works was absolutely delicious! I appreciated the generous portions and look forward to another meal there. Today was my first time eating at the family friendly restaurant and would like to thank all of the staff but especially Donna my server and the cooks for a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Normal greasy food.  Service was especially nice.  Clean. Had Sunday football on multiple TVs.  Toast was stale.  Bacon was limp.  Coffee mugs are tiny.but server left us the pot."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location & WOW! Super impressed with the wait staff!! Gotta say my initial greeting at the door wasn't the best. I had walked up to the podium & there was a large party that got called in that came up from behind me who was seated. Then there was a couple behind me & the host went right to them & looked right by me. I had to speak up to him & tell him I was there to be seated. He then took me to be seated. Not sure what he thought I was doing while standing in front of the podium & hadn't walked in with the big party????? I was greeted maybe 10 minutes later by my waitress???? It seemed like forever but I was soooo hungry so who really knows....lol When our waitress came over she was very friendly & smiley. MANUELA was her name.  I placed my drink order & my breakfast while I waited for my friend to join me.  Soon after my friend showed up & Manuela came right back & got her order. Another waitress ended up bringing our food out. (Yes, both meals at the same time when I placed my before my friend did...not sure how that happened?) I was a little shocked with my entree because I thought it was a sandwich which it was but not your normal sandwich. I can't remember the name of it but it had a croissant on the bottom cooked in a pan with the ingredients on top & open with no top croissant. This waitress saw the look on my face & wasn't surprised since this has happened to other customers before. She knew what I wanted & went back & placed my order. Great team work!!! It was delicious but what was my favorite was your banana nut muffins!! OMG so soft, moist & served warm. I'm not a big fan of nuts in my breads or cookies but they were cut so small & it didn't ruin the muffin. I ended up with 3 & a loaf to go home with. It's better then the banana bread I make, I hate to admit this....lol If you want to try their banana nut muffin for free & it's your first visit there tell your waitress this! First visits & making it known gets you a free muffin & its sooooo worth it!!!  Restaurant was clean & a busy place which is always a good sign. Their bathrooms were nice too. Clean & kept well. They also have outside seating which I noticed when I left is doggie friendly. Place closes early @ 3pm but is open @ 6am. They also have other items on their newspaper like menu that don't' consist of just breakfast items. Definitely a place worth checking out, esp. this location. I've been to the one on Sunset & wasn't too impressed but I'd def. go back to this one & ask for MANUELA. Thanks for such friendly & fun service!!!"}
{"text":"I love the small town vibe of Egg Works. The breakfast food is delicious for a reasonable price. I recommend the banana nut muffin! It is so delicious; the first time I ate here I ordered one to go. There is a train that travels around the ceiling of the cafe, which is a cute touch. This is a great place to take the family! I would highly recommend if you are looking for a go-to breakfast place."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been to 3 locations (one of them being Egg & I) and they are all amazing! My favorite breakfast restuarants in all of Las Vegas. Easily a locals favorite! I get something different almost every time and all of it is good!"}
{"text":"I had one of their skillet breakfast and it was great! Loaded with lots of fixing and enough to bring home leftovers. Our server Donna was also very friendly and we didn't even have to ask for refills, she was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Nice and friendly place... our server vanessa is very quick and friendly... good place for brunch for every one."}
{"text":"This place has huge portions and great service. We had a large group and the wait staff was quick and attentive. I had the Loco Moco I think it was called from the Hawaiian style breakfasts. It was a nice change from a typical breakfast. The banana nut muffin was delicious. Another person had the bacon French toast and really liked it even though the sauce was very rich. Our daughter had the mouse pancake and it was so cute. There were many delicious options for the vegetarians in the group."}
{"text":"Decided to grab breakfast before a flight. There was open seating at the counter which gave me enough time to enjoy a leisurely breakfast. I sat and ordered a chicken fried steak and was soon joined by a couple to my right who placed their order a few minutes later. They received their food right away as another couple were seated to my left. They soon ordered and received their food. I asked our mutual server what the status of my meal was, and after checking, he came back laughing saying he forgot to put the order in to the kitchen. Naturally I didn't share his amusement and asked for the check for my coffee and muffin. Given the wait, I had lost my time to enjoy my breakfast, and didn't want to risk any further delays waiting for food that I would now have to wolf down. He was gracious enough to tell me there was no charge for the coffee and muffin."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and I got here as often as we can. it's seriously the best breakfast place we've been too. the service, the food, everything. would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Let's put it this way,I am sick of getting banana nut muffins for free!!!!,always something wrong with my food 3 out of 5 times very sad situacion, patetic."}
{"text":"Love that they moved to this location which is much closer to me.  I usually sit at the bar and they are always quick.  The breakfast is always hot and simply delicious.  I have a lot of favorites and as I've said before the seasoned potatoes and fries are to die for yum!  I bought the seasoning salt also.  The staff is always friendly and hard workers.  My only complaint is that the hard boiled eggs come w/ the shell.  I never order that so its not a big deal, but when I do I hate taking the shell off myself.  Overall, I still give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"This location is always quick, friendly, and the food is amazing. I absolutely LOVE their little egg flag that you put up when you need something and they always react SO quickly. It's awesome!"}
{"text":"Late post. Breakfast with our LV family and we're happy and satisfying the craves for sure! Check each photo of our feast and you'll know why, huge portion and not Manini (small kine) They got local faves and interesting ones too. Definitely we will be back again on our next trip LOL"}
{"text":"Five stars for Nicole! My son and I come here every Saturday before our weekly grocery shopping and always ask.for Nicole! She is attentive, friendly and always takes good care of us.   The food is really good - the banana nut muffins are yum and if you get the pancakes try the harvest batter its like dessert!  I would give five stars if they would offer regular shredded hashbrowns and wasnt quite so expensive. Maybe even offer early morning specials/discounts."}
{"text":"This restaurant is horrible on wait times. We came in with a party of 6 and people came in after us and were seated before we were. I find that highly unacceptable and that's not ok period. We waited for at least 30 mins with no regards to the hostess saying when we would be called or anything"}
{"text":"Just a great place. 1st time there so the hooked us up with hot banana muffins for everyone at table. Awesome. Crepes were great. Also good omelets."}
{"text":"The only thing I want to get at this place over and over again is the wonderfully baked carrot muffin top. It comes complimentary with your meal. WOW. It's delicious. The main dish is just ok on the other hand. Nothing to grossly out of place, but just not spectacular. I got the chorizo burrito-one of the specials of the morning. Too much chorizo..it made the whole burrito taste too salty. I would've mixed in a little less meat and more fresh ingredients than it would have been banging. The side potatoes were not bad. Would give it another try.."}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite breakfast place. Veronica always makes sure you get the best of service. She makes you feel welcomed and makes sure you leave with a smile."}
{"text":"Yum!! Egg Works offers huge portions with great prices.  Plus they are so accommodating.  One of my favorites is the country fried steak skillet.  It's a skillet with a layer of potatoes, chopped country fried steak, country gravy, and eggs.  Also comes with toast.  Or if you have a sweet tooth like I do, the strawberry cream cheese french toast is a must try.  Really love that they offer a few alcoholic beverages.  Their Bloody Marys and Mimosas are delicious!   Service is always quick and friendly.  The food comes out so fast.  And if you don't see your server but need something, all you have to do is flip the egg on your table to yellow.  They really make it easy here!"}
{"text":"PK is the absolute best at this spot. Ask for him every time you go there you won't regret it. He's friendly, funny, and he's from Hawaii!!! So all you other local Las Vegas Hawaii transplants/visitors... Hit up PK at this Egg Works location. Amazing person and amazing server! Mahalos brada PK!"}
{"text":"Line moves fast. They text you when it's your time to be seated . They also  have a website link to show how long you've been waiting and how many people ahead of you. Very friendly staff and tons of space."}
{"text":"Zero stars They were busy but just horrible service.  Brought the wrong Oder.  Never brought Salsa, even though ordered and asked for twice.  Brought English muffin after asking.  No refills on soda or coffee.  Took plate with uneaten eggs and never asked why meal not eaten (register person never asked how meal or service was).  Over all avoid this place.  lost customer forever."}
{"text":"I went there two days in a row because I had purchased a Groupon and after having one dish taken off it wasn't used. I had the stuffed French toast and tried an omelet as well the first day. The stuffed drenched toasted was not stuffed it was simply a ton of cream cheese and strawberry jelly smothering both breads in the middle and on top. The omelette was greasy and their \"diablo \" spice is  a weird mix of spice and sugar. Today we tried banana and chocolate pancake and the Cabo burrito. The waitress forgot to put in pancake order (it happens )  they quickly brought it out and it was under cooked to the point where you could see the pancake mix. The burrito was also very greasy. However the potatoes without the spice were good.  After leaving both days my stomach started hurt and needless to say the food didn't sit well In my stomach. I read reviews on this place, but after going twice and trying 4 different meals mediocre food and service is an understatement. My teenager can cook a better meal. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"We took some new friends to Egg Works and had a great breakfast with a coffee pot that was never empty.  The food was delicious and the service outstanding. My favorite is always the bacon and onion skillet."}
{"text":"This place is great. Try the skillet breakfast and don't forget to check in and get the free muffin."}
{"text":"Good service but everything was too salty!!! Maybe the house potatoes need to be less seasoned. I think I reached my sodium intake for the year here"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time because of groupon. Good food even better service! Our server, Sara, was great. It is sometimes hard to strike a balance between interruptions/checkins and keeping distance, but Sara has it down. I never had to ask for refills and our order was served promptly and correctly. That is really saying something as I often make substitutions and changes to menu items when ordering. Any additional requests throughout the meal were fulfilled quickly too. She was attentive without hovering too much which made for an awesome experience!  We will definitely return because for her."}
{"text":"thank you to dolly and her very wonderful staff u ladies rock , Kudos !!! only breakfast spot for me in the valley"}
{"text":"Went to Eggs Works this morning. Breakfast was very good. I got the Sunrise Mountain it was very good, my son enjoyed his Mickey Pancake & my husband had Moci Loco & liked it very muck. Our server Shantel was amazing!  We will be returning."}
{"text":"Great solid place like the rest of them.  Tough to make this a 5 star.  I think you have to do something pretty special, but this place is very close.  You really can't go wrong here, and there is something for everyone.  The prices are decent, and the food is always done well.  Skillets, omelets, and hash are the way to go in my opinion, but the sweet stuff is good here too.  Hablo Diablo potatoes are a really solid side, and if you check in on Yelp, you get a free muffin.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Really solid breakfast place.  Friendly service, good food, and reasonable prices.  Nothing crazy great, but I haven't found anything to complain about here."}
{"text":"Food was great and marianne was a wonderful, attentive server. Everytime i eat here the portions are big and the food is tasty from the pizza to the breakfast.  Come early if you are getting breakfast as it it gets fully very fast"}
{"text":"It was the First thing my bf and I ate after a 5 hour flight from Tampa 5am in the morning and arrived 11am Fl time. I think it only tasted decent bc we were hungry. Not worth the money for the place. I shouldn't order the Bloody Mary. Bumped my bill up to $45 bucks for two people. He ordered breakfast country fry chicken. Wasn't too bad. I had waffles which wasn't worth it with the sausage and eggs. I only like my blueberry muffin. It was delicious but luckily I got it for free bc I \"checked in\" on yelp. Take my mix drink out. Is it worth to spend $35 for breakfast that tasted normal? No."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I love food. We eat out alot at many different places.  This was absolutely, hands down, the BEST breakfast I've ever had. My husband and friends all thought the same. Coffee, amazing. My avocado and bacon omelette was stuffed full of delicious, ripe avocado. The potatoes were fantastic. Fruit plate had a variety of fresh fruits. My husband's breakfast burrito was gigantic and delicious. Loved the sauce! Our server was nice and attentive. I'd eat here everyday if I had one in my area!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great services. Suzzy was wonderful and attentive. We ordered a chile relleno omelette and cinnamon raisin French toast I'd say it was a 3/5 French toast was completely brown on one side omelette had too much sauce. It was decent food but awesome service by Suzzy.   3/30/2016 Caroline was awesome! Food was better than last time! We got French toast again, needs improvement but it's good. This time we brought our children and they loved it too! I'm stuffed! Caroline was super attentive and dos her job very well!"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast spot. I don't know why but their menus (newspaper style) annoy the crap out of me. It's like reading a newspaper that's been sitting in the rain. Gross.   Standard breakfast flair. I had a salad but my friend had a parfait and it looked soo tasty. Presentation is a little awkward if you want to eat the granola with the yogurt (in a long skinny glass) so I'd recommend requests a different playing.   All in all, it was a solid experience."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast. Our server, Eden was terrific. Our 2 year old devoured the banana nut muffin and the chili telleno omelet and veggie Benedict were really good."}
{"text":"This place is great for everyone and especially a family place. Food is incredible and I love the seasoning they use on the potatoes. Love the French toast and love the skillets. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I got blueberry pancakes and they delivered big time. Great food.. the real blueberry and huge cakes made for a feast. Looking forward to hitting this place again."}
{"text":"This place is great! They have a huge menu with a wide variety of unique food dishes. Everything we ordered was delicious. The hostess was wonderful, and so was our fabulous waitress Tanya. The place has a loud, fun atmosphere. They're only open for breakfast and lunch. We're definitely going back here!"}
{"text":"This Egg Works is the the best restaurant ever for breakfast, my husband and I come here every weekend. Veronica is AMAZING, and the rest of the Team as well! So friendly and you all always make us feel at home! Thank you all for your EXTRAORDINARY, EXCELLENT service!"}
{"text":"Our first time at Egg Works, serves fast and our server, Robert, was very friendly, and attentive. Will definitely return.  I give it five stars"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and wow! Lots of choices and a great place. We got there and got a table really quick, heard it's usually really busy so we were lucky.  It also has local Hawaiian loco Moco and Portuguese Sausage & SPAM :).  So better then eggs n things back home lol :)"}
{"text":"Place was crazy busy so we found 2 open spots at the counter. Fun!  The blackened prime rib Benny was wonderful.  Coffee kept coming and the classic vibe of a breafast venue makes this a must."}
{"text":"So I heard this place was similar to The Cracked Egg, which is my boyfriend and my go to breakfast spot, so of course we had to try it. But I have to say I like Egg Works a lot more. The food is better and the staff is a lot kinder. I have also found that the seat you faster, and check in with you more frequently. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We had a great server name kat and here for the first time we both had omelette we really enjoyed there potatoes we will return again"}
{"text":"The food and coffee was delicious . The banana muffin was also good. I ordered the pork carn ranch it was sooo good."}
{"text":"My family and I love Egg Works. I go there at least once a week with my family or friends.  They are always urgent to get you seated and the service is always great. I usually go to the one on Eastern but I have gone to the one on Sunset and it's no different the food and service is consistently good!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken fried steak and it was so good I would recommend it! Plus my waitress Lindsey was very nice!"}
{"text":"We came in closer to noon and were seated promptly even though it was still pretty busy. The food was delicious! We ordered the harvest candied walnut pancakes which were fluffy and great! We also ordered The Works omelet and California crepe and both were very tasty and super filling. The coffee was delicious, too! Definitely coming back here! Service was very attentive and friendly. Thank you, Lisa!"}
{"text":"Ethan was an excellent server; polite and prompt. Love this place for breakfast. Try the huge michelada, its tasty!"}
{"text":"We came here on a busy Saturday for brunch but the hostess told us there was no wait at the bar so we decided to sit ourselves. I thought being in the dining area was hectic but I thought wrong. Sitting right in front of where the servers get their food from the cooks was so stressful to watch. We sat down to absolute chaos.  There were no utensils and only one menu on the counter where we were sitting. As we shared and read the menu together, many servers kept returning the food because things were wrong on them. We couldn't help but watch them stress over the food they erroneously brought to their customers and now they have to return to the cooks to re-do them or fix them.  After 10 or so minutes of watching this, we were finally greeted by one of them. She get our orders and told us, \"It might take a while, as you can see behind me.\" Yeah, no kidding. Food kept getting returned one after another. It wasn't too encouraging and I hoped our food would be delicious & not messed up.  The wait for the food wasn't too long even with how busy it was. We had to ask for utensils and for a few minutes, the server couldn't find any to give to us. How odd.   That banana muffin was to die for! I ordered Chicken Fried Steak & it was delicious! The seasoned potatoes were so good, not salty. My eggs were cooked well. Unfortunately, my boyfriend got the short end of the stick. He ordered Loco Moco because his Hawaiian bum was craving it but it was a miss. The server asked how he'd like the burger steak and he said medium, which is his usual. The gravy was delicious but cutting into the meat was a disaster. The outside was cooked but the inside was simply uncooked, cold, mushy and pink goo. We've always ordered medium & this was definitely not medium.  We left disappointed & my boyfriend hungry. Eating cold, raw meat is not the biz. Maybe next time.. maybe."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious! Waffles are great. Their toast is buttered for you. The banana nut bread is a must have. And the potatoes are diced nice and bite sized with great seasoning. Great breakfast option, especially since it's better than IHOP and the lines are shorter"}
{"text":"Two things I uphold above all in my reviews:  Customer service & food (quality, taste, veg options)  When I first walk in to order food to-go door girl or Naomi from what I spotted greets me with a scowl on her face and asks if I want a table. No, ordering out. can I have a menu please? she says \"Order at the counter\" ... Can-I-have-a-menu-PLEASE? \"Oh, u want a menu.... here. \" she hands me a stack. I put the overflow back. She's still scowling.   Finally, I decide what I want and approach the counter/cooking area. Sunny takes my order with a cheerful smile on her face and was extremely helpful in putting together a combo option for what I was ordering and directing me that when I was ready I could pay and pick up my food at the front where I originally was. I thanked her and went back to pissy pants.   Door girl doesn't even smile, says \"You ready to pay?\"... then as I take a seat in the waiting area, I wasn't sure if Sunny knew where I was sitting but I noticed her maybe 10 minutes later with an order looking around.   I ask door girl if my order is ready and she literally rolls her eyes and says \"She'll bring it over when it's ready lady\"  ..... (these dots represent the angered pause in my head)  Finally, a different waitress approaches me and asks what I ordered and subsequently brought me the order as Sunny was held up with another guest.   As I leave, Sunny had run outside to find me still in my car and politely said \"You forgot your strawberries!\" I thanked her and the 3rd waitress for their polite and prompt customer service.   Sunny should be appreciated or promoted to show her level of excellent customer interaction. it was very pleasant!  Naomi \"door girl\" should be fired. In a customer facing role as the first person that guests see and that first impression that is crucial for return business, she is seriously offering a lack of enthusiasm and disservice.   I am a return guest because I do love the quality of food here, and this location is close to my home and the hours offered for late breakfast! but customer service is about 50/50 currently with her as the \"face\" of Egg Works."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times.. Different locations first time to this one.. Line was pretty fast Saturday AM.. Food was good.. nothing really amazing.. but it is good reasonably priced breakfast food.. I would go there anytime if you in the mood for some home style cooking."}
{"text":"Our first time here. Visiting from CA. My cousin who lives here recommend it to us. He also suggested we ask for Lisa T to be our waitress. Omgosh this is now going to be our go to place when we are in town. Lisa is such a sweet person. She went above and beyond to make our meal an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Good food.  Friendly staff, good value.  Very glad I we ate breakfast here before we left Las Vegas.  My only criticism is that the \"Works Potatoes\" were a tad over seasoned.  Not sure what their seasoning consists of entirely, but there was some chili powder and possibly some paprika.  My other half, put his potatoes in the leftovers of his sausage gravy to calm down the seasoning.  I just didn't finish mine.  They were hot and crispy, just a little too much seasoning."}
{"text":"Having just read the previous review from Zoe B, I feel compelled to comment.  My husband and I frequent this Egg Works several times a week for dinner.  Not only is the food always flawless, and we order a variety of different items from the menu, but the management down to the bussing staff always bend over backwards to make sure our food is prepared the way we like it and that we are well taken care of.  We have enjoyed everything from eggs, to pancakes (the pumpkin are a particular favorite) to salads to their delicious pizzas.  We are so happy that the restaurant is now serving in the evening hours and will continue to frequent this establishment."}
{"text":"I am still a huge fan of this place, and I have wandered around the menu since my last review.   This morning I had the Egg Taliana (which is eggs, with italian sausage, homemade marinara, and I want to say monterrey jack cheese). My husband had their Banana Nut french toast (comes with maple syrup and apple compote).   This place has not disappointed us. If you haven't gotten breakfast here... YOU ARE MISSING OUT!"}
{"text":"It's a noisy restaurant to have breakfast or lunch. The hostess will seat you. If there is a wait they will inform you of the wait time.  The food is good diner food. The selections are grouped by section (omelets, non egg, griddle, etc.). If you need service you flip over a sign on your table and any of the staff will come over to help you. There are several rooms to be seated in. There are tables with armless chairs and some 1/2 bench seating with armless chairs. When it's busy it would be difficult for a scooter to get around. You pay at the front counter. It is a very noisy place. There are several tv on but they are on mute with closed caption running. It seems all the tv are set to sports channels.  The parking lot can get full.  You can get food to go."}
{"text":"Huge amounts of fresh and tasty stuff for breakfast, delivered by quick and courteous wait staff. All four of our group thoroughly enjoyed our meals, and only one of us got more than half of the food eaten.  Doggy bags for breakfast??  Well worth a try; a hidden delight.  And if you are lucky enough to get Sandra for your waitress, say hi!"}
{"text":"Dammit! I really wanted to like this restaurant since it's rated highly. The waitress Victoria was so nice. Some of the dishes we ordered were cooked way too salty: The Traditional and the Corned Beef Hash were unbearable.  I hope the cook on Tues Mar 29, 2016 at 6:15am fixes the salt problem. Please do not over saturate your foods with salt! As for the waitress Victoria. She was cool."}
{"text":"Delicious skillet breakfast, phenomenal banana nut muffin, and the best service anyone can ask for from Ashley."}
{"text":"We went here last week with a groupon and based on the line outside, I knew we found a great breakfast spot. Despite the line, we got seated quickly and were greeted by our server immediately.  There was so much yummy options to choose from on the menu that I was overwhelmed! I decided on a veggie omelet with artichoke cheese. Unfortunately, I forget the name but . It was fabulous!! And the potatoes were amazing. We came back two days later and I got the same thing. I will definitely branch out after seeing everyone's amazing pictures on yelp.  Great place and a good deal considering we had a groupon. Excited that they are opening another location closer to us!"}
{"text":"I landed in Las Vegas at the ugly hour of 6:55 a.m. By 7:45 a.m., I was at Egg Works. Upon walking it, you wonder if you might suffer food poisoning later. The decor is pretty run down, the layout isn't very pretty. But oh my gosh, I had the best waitress ever. She was wonderful.  I ordered a mimosa, I was given an individual size bottle of champagne, along with a glass of orange juice, so I could make my own cocktail as strong as I wanted to, without anyone raising an eyeball at me beginning my day of drinking at such an early hour.  The service was outstanding. The food comes in pretty large portions, and wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was hot and good. I had french toast, eggs, hash browns, and bacon. And of course, my beautiful mimosa. My companion had chicken fried steak with potatoes and gravy.  Both dishes were yummy. The menu is varied, so even if you are a picky eater, you will find something that makes you happy.   When you go, ask for Melinda. She's awesome.   I'd add more descriptive words. But someone stole my thesaurus, which is bad. Very bad. Yes, bad.  P.S. - Melinda, if you are reading this, and I know you told me you check Yelp every now and again - I hope you won the $100 prize for your Halloween costume!"}
{"text":"We got to Egg works about an hour before closing on a Monday and we got in right away. We ordered the cream cheese French toast and country Benedict with hollandaise instead of sausage gravy. We checked in with Yelp and each received a free banana muffin. When the food came out the eggs were hot so we ate them first. When we tried the French toast it was good but cold. We didn't ask to have it heated because it had cream cheese and whipped cream on it. Unfortunately, this kind of detracted from our enjoyment of the dish. Our waitress was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Quality food and service. I loved to go here when I still ate eggs and meat. However, the food is definitely a little pricey. It's worth it when you want to get a nice diner breakfast.  I will always choose this over IHOP because i get so much better value, and the atmosphere is nice. The other only downside is they dont have as many vegetarian and non-dairy options as i would like"}
{"text":"Awesome every time we come to town! Seasoned potatoes are the best. Mexican omelette is always a winner and my boyfriend says the pork carnitas benny is one of the best things he has had. BIG portions- come starving!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick breakfast on the WEEKDAYS! Weekends are crazy busy and not enjoyable. Their food is perfect proportion and service is excellent. My one complaint is the cost of coffee....come on $5 for a cup of folgers????"}
{"text":"Great food,  selection,  overwhelming number of choices.  On my must visit list for Vegas.  Great friendly service.  Cant wait to try other things on menu. My daughter had a skillet dish,  I had buckwheat pancakes... so hard to find.  Loved this place"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here Sunday.  We arrived at exactly the wrong time and had to wait about 30 minutes for our party of three to be seated.  The restaurant seems to have a large number of tables for two, as nearly all parties of two were seated almost immediately.  I guess the timing didn't work out sooner for two tables to be pushed together.  Waiting until nearly noon before I had my first cup of coffee did not make me happy!  However, once we sat down the service was great.  We got our food quickly.  I loved the menu.  There were so many options that were right up my alley, with skillets, Mexican breakfast dishes, etc.  I ordered a skillet with chili.  It was fairly simple.  Potatoes, chili, cheese and two poached eggs.  It was really tasty.  My hubby ordered pork chops and eggs  and he enjoyed those.  He liked the way the pork chops were seasoned.  Our daughter ordered butterscotch pancakes and she wasn't thrilled with them, but she liked ours.  After we were seated, the crowd seemed to thin out.  I guess it was just bad timing on our part.  I hope we can come back again on our next trip!"}
{"text":"Aggressively mediocre. Lots of great Yelp reviews. There's nothing wrong with this place, but it is just average. Loud country music blares. Food is fine but nothing to get excited over."}
{"text":"Candice was very friendly! A happy person deserves a trip to the happiest place on earth! :)"}
{"text":"Good food and an extensive menu. I've had good and mediocre service here. It is busy on a sunday morning and you will have a wait. But overall worth it. With the amount of business that they do, table touches from managers would be helpful so that they know when food is taking too long to get to tables"}
{"text":"Always one of our fav breakfast spots!  Service spot on and never had a bad meal here!  Love the banana muffins!  Can get super busy on holidays and peak weekend times but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Best french toast ever!!! And best potatoe salad ever! Me and my boyfriend love coming here for breakfast. Were always happy when we leave. We've tried many entrees and have always enjoyed whatever we picked. Yummy hot chocolate! always on point. No complaints here! Service is great too. Delish! :)"}
{"text":"All the food was amazing, as was our fantastic server, Donna. She was very sweet and quickly got our food out. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Amy needs that trip to DISNEY! Her amazing service made my morning! Positive and vibrant personality is the key to give great experience, and she has it locked down! Try the Pork chops with eggs and potatoes incredible! So is the waffle with blueberry!!!!! Thank you AMY! You are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Breakfast Joint! We were greeted by a kind host whom immediately sat us. The food was amazing. We had a breakfast burrito,   Country Fried Steak, and a chocolate chip Mickey Mouse pancake. Our waitress Kayla, was not the best part of our visit...she was not at all attentive. I observed other waiters and waitresses smiling and checking with their customers. Our waitress came to take our order, deliver order and to bring our check. I had to ask other wait staff for flavored creamer, and extra napkins. Good thing we were given a carafe of coffee otherwise we would keep our egg sign on sad the entire time. Would've given it a 5 had it not been for our unhappy, attitude waitress. Try smiling more Kayla, it would help!"}
{"text":"I ordered there corn beef hash. I've had better. The service wasn't on par either."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and even better brunch. Can be really busy especially on Sunday. A tad pricey."}
{"text":"super family friendly, good service (incredibly nice workers) and yummy food! definitely recommend dropping by if you're in the area! didn't have to wait to be seated (arrived around 9:30 am) and food was served fairly quickly as well. i had the veggie skillet (eggs with cheese and veggies over potatoes) that came with the choice of toast or a muffin :) - pictured. get your moneys worth for sure! oh, and filling portions! although I'm not in the area any longer, im craving Egg Works & want to try the whole menu! haha"}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Lisa T. Our server was great. Will be back with the grandkids. Liked the country atmosphere. Neat Train that goes around the tracks up above by ceiling."}
{"text":"I probably will only dine here again if a friend invited me to join them.   I never stepped foot inside of the restaurant because I was meeting a small group of friends and they were already seated outside when I showed up. This has nothing to do with anything, but I really wish I hadn't worn jeans and worn my hair down without bringing something to tie my hair away from my neck...it was only 9am and I was sweating...but at least our kids could run and play without disturbing anyone because we were the only ones with the \"bright\" idea to sit outdoors. SO ANYWAY, I have no idea what the inside of the restaurant looks like...nope, didn't even use their restroom while I was there.   Although I had a good time being there because I was with my friends and it's always a pleasure to be in good company, I'm not a fan of this place because I wasn't impressed with the food. The prices were pretty standard and the portion size was fair but the presentation was sloppy. I ordered 'The Classic': two eggs cooked how you want them, breakfast potatoes, bacon or sausage, toast or a banana nut muffin, I chose scrambled hard, turkey sausage and the muffin. My eggs were definitely scrambled hard...overcooked for everyone else, but for me it was fine...my potatoes were over salted and a bit dry, I was given turkey bacon instead of the sausage I asked for but I didn't ask to fix the order because I like turkey bacon but it was overcooked and my muffin was kind of strange looking but that didn't bother me. None of my food came out hot...or even kind of warm for that matter. Not much to boast about this place."}
{"text":"AMAZING. Staff is on point, professional, diligent and knowledgeable of food items. Banana bread, YUM! I could go on and on about this place, but the stars don't lie. If you haven't already, go eat here and enjoy some good food."}
{"text":"First off the place was packed...as usual...but it didn't matter because we were sat within minutes by our server Tamara. She got our drinks and food order immediately and it was awesome. I've been a server/bartender for over half of my life and I recognize a great server when I see one.  As we waited for our food I watched our server Tamara workin it! She was on point. Cleaning her own tables and re seating them immediately. The food came super quick and she made sure we had everything we needed. The food was awesome...but the service made our day!! It's always nice to see a server killing it and also enjoying what they do. Thank you soooooo much to Tamara! We will be back soon. If you go to this location ask for her."}
{"text":"We love having breakfast here with or without the kids! We always want to be seated where our favorite server, LuAnna, is because she's the best part of breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast location in town. My husband & I have come here for the past 2 1/2 years. We have NEVER had a bad meal. We have NEVER had bad service. We have NEVER benn disrespected as guests. & have come to know the waiters&waitresses. THIS.........is a family. My husband&I request Sir PKs station EVERY.........SINGLE.......TIME! Sir PKs knowledge, professionalism, warmth, love for his job & his guests is above standards. We love ypu & look forward to next week!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast fare served fast. The complementary bran muffin for first time visitors was just right. Our server Donna is aMAYzing, too!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast and I was immediately seated.  Best American breakfast food here than anywhere in the country.  I always make a stop when traveling through Las Vegas.   Big thank you to Nicole for being my server and being a blast!  (Your going to Disney Land!)"}
{"text":"This place ha been packed each time we went. That being said the service was good. Our breakfast was timely and delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to come for breakfast  The train is super cool to watch too!  Fabulous homemade corned beef hash!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast! The biscuits and gravy are by far the best....and the banana nut loaf is A MusT! Always great service, Marlene has been our waitress the last two times and she is awesome, always so friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today. My server, Candice was extremely nice and helpful. She was perky but not in an annoying, fake perky way.   I ordered the carnitas crepe. It came with a banana nut muffin. The muffin tasted like it was day old and reheated. The crepe looked unappetizing sitting there with a lonely dollop of sour cream and unimaginative side of green salsa. I took a bite of the crepe and it was bleh. It was overcooked and the carnitas was unflattering and had no discernible flavor. But I loved the potatoes. I finished all of the potatoes.   When I came to the register to pay, the cashier was counting out a drawer and there were two other servers standing around. No greeting whatsoever, no \"hi, I'll be right with you\" just nothing. They all ignored me. After about 5 minutes, the cashier had finished and was able to help me.   I walked out of there disappointed."}
{"text":"I somehow end up here once every three months because of how consistently good it is!   I usually change up my order but two items that are a definite must have every time I go: banana muffin and the breakfast potatoes.   The banana muffin is free if you check into Yelp (& the servers are aware of it!) and it's great. The texture is great and you can taste the flavor evenly through.   The breakfast potatoes have a seasoning that just helps balance out the meal. I have never been disappointed with the potatoes!  I recently got the banana bread french toast, which was amazing. Just like the muffin, the texture is perfect for a french toast breakfast item and the flavor is consistent all the way through.  The weekends get super busy here, so I suggest coming early if you're not into waiting!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town! The staff has a low turn over rate so you know it's good! Always constant"}
{"text":"Decided to check Yelp for a great breakfast spot while in town, and we stummbled across Egg Works. Its a very cute and comfy place with ellecent service! We had the same server twice on different days and thats exactly how I perfered it because she was so personable and amazing at serving us! We utilized the Yelp check in and got the banana bread, all I can say is get it!  Great experience both times we went, and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"First time here server Roslin was fantastic very attentive and a super personality   food was excellent and plentiful.   Would definitely come back next we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I really like eating here. The food is delicious. The banana nut muffins are super tasty too. Eat here... it will make your tummy happy.   UPDATE 05.02.2015 came in on Saturday for brunch. Despite how busy the place was, we were seated within 10 min! Chelsea was our waitress and she was excellent and a had a delightful personality. I've been to Egg Works more than a dozen times and Chelsea is the first one to ever mention using the happy egg/sad egg signs on the table to signal you need assistance. So I thought that was neat that she mentioned it. I ordered the stuffed French toast. It was delicious. One thing I love about Egg Works is that they provide a ton of flavored creamer. Rarely do I see restaurants offering flavored creamer."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you want typical breakfast yums. I've been here more than a dozen times and one thing I can say is that they are very consistent.   If you're a meat eater, they've got delicious sausage links. The works potatoes are very unique and yummy as well. One thing they do here that I've never seen any other restaurant do, is serve flavored coffee creamer. They bring you a ton too, which I like since I use a lot of creamer in my coffee. Normally I have to ask for more creamer at other restaurants, but not at Egg Works!   The service here is also always very good."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place was packed when my friends and I walked in. We actually went to the bar because the wait looked to be long.  But now I know why,  The food was so fast and amaze balls. I got a banana nut muffin and had a waffle. Both so good, (GET THE MUFFIN!!) my friends and I ordered mimosas and bloody Mary's to drink, another must (the bloody Mary's are so yummy). Would I come back and recommend this place... HELL YES. Such good service and wonderful food."}
{"text":"Haven't found a great breakfast place until egg works.   It reminds me of the east coast, love it will always come back for more"}
{"text":"LOVED my experience here! The food, atmosphere and service was amazing!   As soon as I walked in I felt so welcomed and cozy, like I was having breakfast at a friends or something. Mugs are already on the table. And the mugs aren't like your dainty little coffee cups that you have to keep asking refills for, they're cute mugs that have their logo on it.    The menu offered so many options and it took us almost 10 minutes to figure out what to eat.  I eventually decided to get a skillet and my boyfriend got the breakfast burrito. Goodness. The portions are HUGE!! Definitely one of those, save half for lunch kind of places.  The skillet was sooo good. Melted cheese on potatoes, avocado, ham...my oh my.  If you check in here, you also get a free banana nut muffin which is definitely worth a try! I love banana nut muffins and the ones they make here are pretty top notch.   I would definitely come here again, if I wanted to get away from the strip and have a relaxing breakfast."}
{"text":"Great family friendly atmosphere, food is always consistently delicious with nice presentation, friendly,accommodating and attentive staff. Only wish it were open longer hours."}
{"text":"Update: After having a really bad past experience, I was contact by Kat Wilson and Mr. Wilson handled my issues so professionally. I am always visiting both locations, I swear their coffee is the best in town but that's besides the point. Mr. Wilson helped make everything right by hearing my issues out. Thank you so much!  Came here for lunch on a Thursday and one of my favorite spots. Today the service was lacking. Whoever the male hostess was, was not only rude but impersonal. Didn't greet us and walked us to the table and dropped off menus and walked away before we even sat. He did that with several tables around us. Didn't let us know who our server was... it took ten minutes for a server to get to us. I'm fine with that when it's busy but they weren't busy because it was later in the afternoon. Usually really love the service and food and today was not a good day for them."}
{"text":"Awesome food banana bread malted in my mouth. Awesome service from dani!!!!!! This will be are new Monday breakfast date."}
{"text":"Amber was our server, she was excellent!  Blackened prime rib benny was delicious, my boyfriend got the stuffed french toast which was amazing. We were greeted and seated promptly, coffee pot on the table for easy refills.  Wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Service was awesome but my food was not very good this time around... I was excited because I ate at another Vegas location and it was awesome but this time around was just ok.."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge breakfast food foodie, but Egg Works has the best chicken fried steak I have tasted to date.   Yesterday was my second visit to an Egg Works establishment and my first visit to this location on south Rainbow. This restaurant was very busy at 1pm on Sunday - for breakfast. It was nice to be able to sleep in on a Sunday and still go out to breakfast during lunchtime.   When I entered the restaurant, it was packed. The hostess, who looked and acted like she'd seen a full shift already, took our name and told us to wait five minutes. She managed to do/say all that without once looking at me. The thought occurred to me to turn and run, but Yelping has kind of made me stick things out for the sake of the review! Within five minutes, we were seated in the middle section of this open restaurant at the end of the row at a small table for two. Since I knew what I wanted, I didn't need to look through a menu. My son, however, took about five minutes to settle on which omelet he wanted. Our menus closed up to signal someone that we were ready to order. Nope, we waited for another five minutes as we watched servers race by us one by one. We even experienced some servers' toss their tray by their side and drench the floor and our feet with the water that had rested on their trays from beverages. I forewarned one server who was carrying several heavy plates as he passed over this puddle next to our table. This gentleman did clean the floor by my ankles after returning with empty hands. Still no server for us to take our order!   Suddenly, Bridgette approached our table. She asked if someone had taken our beverage order. I told her \"No!\" so she took our beverage order and then told us she would let our server, Lisa, know that our table belonged to her. Upon bringing back out beverage order, there was still no sign, apology, or eye contact from Lisa. I actually watched Lisa maneuver around our table numerous times. So, Bridgette took our food order. I ordered the chicken fried steak and my son ordered the chili rellenos omelet. After this order was taken, I saw Bridgette patiently waiting for Lisa to finish an order as she held a ticket in her hand. I had a funny feeling that she was planning to give our ticket to Lisa. So, I motioned Bridgette over to our table. Upon confirmation of her intention, I told her she took our order and would remain our server or we would leave. End of story!  Bridgette was wonderful and the food was excellent. The restaurant was a zoo, however. I understand busy, but patrons also deserve to enjoy their meals. I found myself protecting my belongings (e.g., purse, iPhone) from possible water damage. Honestly, I felt like I was watching an Indy 500 race and betting on who would fall on the newly forming puddle of water collecting in front of my table again! There was also something rather unprofessional looking about the Egg Work apparel in general - tight jeans even on hostesses and management.  I continued to watch as staff cleared tables clanking dishes into bus tubs that were placed on chairs and hostesses that dropped menus at tables without so much as a \"enjoy your meal\" before turning and walking away.   Somewhere towards the end of our meal, I noticed a sign explaining how to obtain service. Seriously, it was a sign that educated me on the yellow sad face or the black happy face. If I was unhappy and needed service I was to flip and reveal the egg shaped sad face attached as an ornament to my condiment tray. If I was happy or everything was fine, I was to have the black egg shaped happy face on top. Really? Can I take a minute to rant about service? Too bad, I am going to do it anyway! What is wrong with looking at people? Is it really that hard to see that your customer is aimlessly staring at you for assistance? Is it that hard to ask your customers how they are doing? Would it be too much for servers to prepare a table for the upcoming meal (e.g., ketchup, sugar, silverware, napkins)?  Is this why I couldn't get Lisa to notice my table? Good thing Bridgette used her brain and wasn't self reliant on a yellow/black symbol to denote my need for service.   Come-on guys, this has to be done better. You have a good produce for a fair price but poor customer relation skills. I may visit another location and see if this is an Egg Works philosophical way of doing business or a single establishment problem."}
{"text":"Went here with my sister and nephews . Love it! I got an omelette with bacon, sausage and other meats and potatoes. Potatoes were good they were dusted with seasoning. I had orange juice and my order came with a choice of toast or muffin. muffin was was warm it went well with meal. Kid friendly they give you crayons and paper."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here Sunday morning. The restaurant was very busy. We were lucky to get a booth and received excellent food and service from our waitress Veronica. She was fast and very friendly. Food was de-lish. : )"}
{"text":"This is the go to place for breakfast everything was amazing here. The service the food the atmosphere. If you like good food come here! They have a big selection and everything they have is most certainly delicious!"}
{"text":"Never a bad meal.  I always love their veggie benny or spinach benny.  Husband always orders the skillet with sausage and bacon.  Fast service and the servers are friendly.  Kids love their meal like the buckaroo or the mickey mouse pancakes."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast recently, I was really hoping for a delicious breakfast but I was very disappointed.  We ordered our food griddles and waffles and both came out within minutes which was surprisingly fast. The potatoes on the bottom of my skillet were soggy and the waffles were soggy. Everything even the muffin tasted microwaved. Lattes and cappuccinos are from a coffee machine and not made by hand. I'm disappointed and will never return"}
{"text":"Food was decent, but was not over all impressed with the food.  The mashed potato omelet did not meet expectations.  The  Sunrise Mountain was ok, the croissant was bland and the whole dish felt like it was missing something.   Grandma's Biscuits and Gravy had excellent gravy, but the biscuits didn't go well with it.  The potato's were excellent on both dishes. I'm not a huge fan of banana nut muffins, but that was probably the softest muffin I have ever had.  The service was spot on and made the visit worth it. Our food was out quickly, our waitress was overly attentive, and other waitresses got us water as they walked by.  I want to go back and try there the seven other things I want on the menu"}
{"text":"Great affordable breakfast and lunch. Staff is always so friendly too. Banana nut muffin is amazing."}
{"text":"Food is great and affordable and you get a lot. Banana nutt muffins are amazing. Staff is so fun and friendly."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately. Our server, Mariia was nice and provided fast service. We used the check-in to get the free banana nut muffin - so glad we did, it was delicious! My boyfriend ordered the Spinach Benny & I got the Veggie Benny. The flavors were nice, but the English muffins were soggy. Would go back, but will be trying something different next time."}
{"text":"The outside look great, the inside made me look twice to check if I was in the right place. I did like the fact they serve egg whites. The prices are a little to much for me when it came to serving size. I had the bacon and avocado egg white omelet, it was delicious."}
{"text":"The service is great here our waitress was wonderful! I ordered the NY Steak with eggs, fresh fruit, and a banana nut muffin (over toast of course). I had ordered my steak medium rare but when it came the steak was medium well. My waitress apologized and explained that the cooks over cook stuff a lot there. She gave me the option to have them remake it but I figured they'd just over cook it again so I declined. Overall I did enjoy my meal and again the service was great!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious,  great taste and good portions. Michelle, our server was phenomenal she was attentive to everything we needed, and made sure we always taken care of."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and service was super fast. Marianne was our waitress and she was very friendly and efficient! I recommend this place for lunch or breakfast!!! :)  very delicious bloody Mary's and mimosas as well!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, as per usual. She was very attentive and, helpful with our orders. I got the veggie skillet with a Banana Nut muffin (which was BOMB) and, it was absolutely phenomenal. I bring all of my out of town friends here and have yet to be disappointed. 10/10"}
{"text":"Great food, unexpeted amount. Actually split it for a lunch too. Its cool to offer a banana bread for free. What is not cool is to charge $2.40 for coffee. A pincher of coffee is cool but i had 1 cup. Give coffee for free with a purchase of something."}
{"text":"Very nice breakfast spot! We a the 4 egg omelet, very good. The service was perfect! The people were also very happy for being at work. That tells me the owners take care of workers.   Defiantly a place you should go!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dining experience! I'm a big original pancake house fanatic, and thanks to groupon now I can have some breakfast variety! I had corned beef hash and eggs ( they have both homemade or canned!) and the best banana nut muffin ever! My friend had NY strip and eggs. That steak was incredible, tender and really delish. Our server Cherie was a delight. Groupon or not.... Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Great food, good service, at a great price. Their coffee is really good also! They are very a busy place but food is always on time. BTW their chile relleno omelette is a must try."}
{"text":"Mario is one of best waiters in all of vegas. Ford is outstanding bere. We have been on the Strip for the nfr rodeo etc and this is one of vegas hidden gems. BE SURE AND TRY IT!"}
{"text":"Not my first time at egg works but my first time at this location. They have a cute patio area with misters but we decided to sit inside. It was pretty dead at 7 am on Sunday so we had immediate service. They have a lot of breakfast options and also serve lunch. I just got 2 eggs, turkey sausage and potatoes. Their potatoes are always so good. Also I wish I purchased their chipotle hot sauce , so good."}
{"text":"If I could eat the Habla Diablo potatoes for every meal, I would. Love this place so much! Gotta visit one of the locations at least once a week."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Highly recommend the prime rib Benny and ask for Michelle!"}
{"text":"Had the mashed potatoes omelet and it was delicious!! Also don't miss the opportunity to try their banana nut muffin!! Was one of the best breakfasts i've had on the road!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! no matter what you order it is the best! if you like a morning drink i recommend the Mimosa!!! they are a self-serve"}
{"text":"I go here for breakfast often! I love the food and the service! Our server Nicole at the ft apache/flamingo location was awesome!! She was super nice and made sure we were have a great time!! Also Veronica at the rainbow/215 location was amazing as well. I felt bad cuz the rest if my party was running behind and we were holding up one of her tables but she assured me it was ok. They were both amazing!! Definitely my go to breakfast spot!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not a fancy breakfast type of lady, but I LOVE IHOP. Okay I said it. Now, that being said, you may be able to better understand why I only gave them 3 stars.   I always get some type of omelet (maybe I should try something new) and seasoned potatoes. Everything is good. Not great. But good. Would I kick it out of bed? Probably not. Would I go out of my way to get it? Probably not.   The service is always great and if I went to restaurants just based on service I would be here all the time."}
{"text":"Great service awesome food and our hostess Amanda was amazing definitely our new breakfast spot"}
{"text":"This is a must stop for breakfast every time we're in Vegas. The huevos rancheros with green sauce is AMAZING. Service is always great, ask for Donna! She was the friendliest waitress we had all weekend! Great coffee too! The original coffee, not the fancy crap just plain ol good ol fashioned coffee!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed in the morning which is a great thing because I don't want it to ever go out of business!! The food selection is amazing, the only issue I have with this place is you have to pay for refills SOMETIMES. Highly recommend this place if you have never been."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and wanted to try something off the strip for once. This place has good reviews and a groupon deal so why not.  First, the service was amazing! Tenika was our server and I don't think anyone had as big a smile as she did! Second, the food was delicious! I had the works skillet and husband had the house made corned beef hash. One of the best breakfasts I've had in a while. Very satisfied with our experience and will be back on our next visit to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"OK, so that banana nut muffin? AMAZING. Our server, Candice, was super sweet and attentive. She knew we had already checked on yelp - not sure how, but she brought us our muffins even before we could order or mention it on our own.  My fiance ordered the prime rib benedict, which he didn't like very much...I had the breakfast burrito, which was REALLY good. The drinks were okay - we had fresh squeezed juice (orange) and a blood mary. I've had better, so I wasn't very impressed...  I would say it's a solid place for breakfast and not terribly expensive. They had SO many choices, it was overwhelming deciding what to order!!!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with this restaurant. The variety of items they offer and the quality of food and the service it's just amazing"}
{"text":"As always a great breakfast with Great service. Even with a last minute change of heart on what to order, Donna made sure we got what our tummies desired."}
{"text":"Went for Fathers Day brunch.   Despite a crowded restaurant, we had excellent service.  Joshua was our server and he was great!   Food was good and came out quickly."}
{"text":"I always like going here or their location on Sahara and Arville.  The menu's items have a good variety, and the food always comes out warm and tasty.  In the years that I've been frequenting the establishments, I haven't had bad service. This recent experience, going around noon, was no different. The funny thing about going in that time frame is that their busiest period had passed. Hahaha... According to the boyfriend, there was like 2 servers to 1 table, constantly checking on their patrons, and still able to have a good time with co-workers.  Anyway, I like their skillets, particularly their Chicken Fried Steak. The boyfriend likes their Patty Melts. I think their fries and red potatoes (breakfast plates) are seasoned the same way. It's just yummy. Hahaha... I like the way they leave the coffee pot with the table so I can just help myself unless that runs out. I think the only thing I didn't like about this experience was paying for the bill... The ladies didn't acknowledge me when I walked up to the desk. They just talked about fixing another table's bill, even though they all made eye contact with me at some point. Then when they were done, the cashier just held her hand out for my bill. Eh."}
{"text":"I like a variety when I eat breakfast so I ordered the Stuffed French Toast. It comes with what looks like a French toast sandwich...two pieces of french toast with eggs/bacon in the middle. I ate them separately instead of all together lol. You also get a big side of potatoes with your meal... Total $11. The service was great and food was yummy! I also got a free banana nut muffin from their foursquare check in offer :)"}
{"text":"This review is long over due... I have been here many times before with family and friends!     As soon as I  walk in we are greeted with a big smile and warm welcome. As soon as we are seated our server  came over to take our drink order. By the time she comes back we are ready to order!      They have a Black and yellow egg sign on the table if the egg is black you are good if you need something flip the egg over to show the yellow side and they come over to your table...    Being from Hawaii I am partial to the Hawaiian food part of the menu. Like the island favorite or the local moco and don't forget the Hawaiian sweet  bread French toast... I always get the banana muffin as my side. ( or you can get toast) Don't forget to check in on yelp they give you a free banana muffin.   The island favorite comes with sticky rice, eggs and a whole Portuguese's sausage and a slice of pineapple. The loco moco is pretty good not the best that I've had, the gravy could use some work. They always bring out the banana muffin first and they warm it up so grab some butter which is already on the table and go to work!!! Lol I really recommend getting this as your side choice!   They have a front counter area with a tv which is nice, it was on sports center while I was there sometimes it's in the local news channel.    This place is always clean and the servers are really friendly, fast service and good food... The menu is pretty extensive and long so check it out and see what excites your stomach....... Happy eating"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good, relaxed breakfast, this is where you go. It can get crowded, so try to go at an off-peak time. Waiting to eat breakfast is not fun. Went at 1PM on a Sunday and were seated promptly.  Stuffed French Toast was great, as was the Banana French Toast. I was really impressed with the Stuffed French Toast. A lot of places try this and fail. You touch the thing with your fork once and it falls apart - not at Egg Works. VERY WELL DONE HERE. Attentive waitress. Food came in a reasonable amount of time. Coffee was left on the table, which is great so you don't have to spend 1/3 of the meal trying to flag down the waitress.   An excellent spot for breakfast. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Came in for Father's Day breakfast, service was great. Our server Karen was great, very quick and efficient. Food was great as well!"}
{"text":"Big portions! Check in on Foursquare and get a free muffin (which came right out of the oven and was DELICIOUS!). You certainly get a generous plate for the price. Great breakfast kitsch. The menu is made to look like a newspaper. Super laid back feel.   Not a huge egg fan but there was still plenty to order. I got the strawberry cream cheese french toast, which was almost sickeningly sweet. Would definitely try something different next time. My friends really enjoyed their skillet and omelette though."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but the service at the Anthem location SUCKS! We had to wait for 10 minutes just to be greeted and then another 7 or 8 to get our drink order in. I could understand if it was busy, but it wasn't... I am a server as well so I understand better than most, but the service we got was just ridiculously terrible."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this place! My fiancé and I love coming here for breakfast. It is packed on weekends but that's too be expected! Service is great and so is the food!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first visit to the Summerlin location.  I have become a regular fan of the great food served at Egg Works, mostly at the Sunset restaurant.  I wanted to visit the new Summerlin location because my favorite waitress, Ashley H., recently transferred there.  I was happy to see her as well as meet Emily and Abby.   The food is exceptional, equally as good as over on Sunset.  This place is very roomy and watching all the staff move around in the performance of their duties is like watching a finely tuned machine - very smooth and efficient.  I spent approximately 7 hours traveling to Summerlin and back again to Henderson on the RTC bus system.  That's how much I treasure Ashley and the food at Egg Works."}
{"text":"Egg-cellent!  We were looking for something new and family friendly and this definitely fit the ticket.  So many options, great staff who was friendly, talkative and helpful.  All our food was wonderful and not a single complaint. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Cordon Bleu and it was really good. Our server was Candice and she was really nice and cheerful! She better win that DISNEYLAND TRIP!"}
{"text":"I always love this as a treat to myself.  It's a quick solid go to for a good hearty breakfast.  I almost always go here alone and just walk immediately to the breakfast bar.  Quick service and within seconds i always get my own carafe of coffee.     Food is always pretty solid here.  Aim more for the omelets though.  I've gotten waffles and pancakes here and they're fine.  But you'll probably forget what you ate after about an hour because they didn't leave an impression.  My go to favorite though is the Chili Rellano omelet.  My mouths watering now just thinking about it.  Slap some hot sauce on that bad boy and you got this cheesy, chili, egg, spicy piece of deliciousness in your mouth.   I always go to work and brag about what I ate after that sucker.  Give this place a go.  Solid service and decent food."}
{"text":"Our Waitress was great, she deserves 5 stars, but the food and the manager was just ok.   I ordered the breakfast pizza. it was soggy dough and runny eggs. I have had breakfast pizzas at other places and there is a way to prepare it where it wont be runny eggs on top of almost uncooked soggy dough. I ended up just helping my sister finish her strawberry waffles and leaving the pizza with a few bites out of it.   I wasn't planning on complaining about it, but when the waitress returned she asked why i wasn't eating my food and i told her why, she said \"oh there has got to be something we can do\". She went to the manager and this is where it got quite interesting. He came over to me with an attitude as if I was bothering him with a complaint. First off, I didn't even need him to come over, I was fine paying for the crappy food and just leaving. The waitress was just being nice enough to try to make sure her table was happy. Second, he then proceeded to explain that the food was prepared perfectly and that is how its supposed to be since it is eggs, I said \"runny?\" he said yes since there is a lot of moisture in eggs. Which we all know is quite untrue because a quiche is made of eggs and it is firm if cooked right. He said that there was nothing he could do and that I would have to pay for it since I ordered it and took a few bites from it.  The most hilarious part of it all, he asked if he could bring a box so i could take it home... WHAT THE? I didn't eat it here why would I eat it at home. No I don't want a box so i can take it home thank you. The waitress seemed shocked and embarrassed by his response, but at that point there was nothing she could do.  I really appreciate her service and her attentiveness. I probably wont ever go to Egg Works again just because that manager was so completely unaware of how eggs are supposed to be prepared. The place is called Egg Works dude! The waffles were good. =)"}
{"text":"Diana was amazing.  Very friendly and kept checking on us.  I got the wrong type of bacon and she fixed the issue very fast and with a smile."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved to the area a month ago and have been to this location twice.  Both times were during the week so we didnt have to wait at all, which was nice.  First time, I was very impressed with the variety of things on the menu, although it is a little pricey, I figured it would be worth it.  I was somewhat right.  Everything was delicious and the portions are HUGE.  I didnt like the seasoning on the homefries though, but it was alright. Second time around, we get this server who has one of those, overly fake, I secretly hate my job but act like im so happy personalities (Im a waitress as well, So I notice these things)  I loooove waffles so I figured theirs would be great, unfortunatly it was nasty.  Tasted like plastic, and I enjoyed the whipped cream more. The reason I am giving such a poor rating is because both times we went they brought out the wrong food.  Although both times it was corrected, It's just sad that it wasnt even busy and they just seem so unorganized.  For the price of the food, its really not worth it.  Dennys or Ihop would suffice."}
{"text":"Food was OK.  While we did have PK as our server, it was slightly disingenuous to be constantly reminded to provide 5 stars for mediocre service.  We had to ask a different server for a take home box.  What's is even more remarkable is that we were followed out the door and \"gently reminded\" to provide 5 stars.  If the service warranted 5 stars, believe me, I would gladly have provided it.  Good luck, PK.  I hope my rating did not hinder your chances to win the contest."}
{"text":"We went for an early morning breakfast today and it was fabulous!!  We had the country Benny and the breakfast veggie crepes. Both were wonderful!!  The banana nut muffins were amazing; warm and flavorful!!!  Our server was Ashley and she did an incredible job!!!!!  Thanks for a great breakfast!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"WOW.  forget \"on-the-strip dining\"! off strip meals are where you'll get your money's worth AND eat delicious food!  egg works 2 is close to the vegas airport and closest to the east end of the strip. egg & i and egg works 1 are closer to the west end of the strip.   so their menu is SUPER LARGE. crepes, pancakes, waffles, bennys, french toasts, skillets, burgers... you name it, it's probably on it.   their must order: BLACKENED PRIME RIB BENNY.       grilled croissant with prime rib, sautéed spinach and roasted red bell peppers       add in 2 poached eggs w/ hollandaise sauce. it does not stop there ... you get hash potatoes (w/ that lawry's like salt) ...for $12. the thing is HUGE. i mean... dude, they grill a croissant as the bread base!!! yes, it probably has more calories than your rec'd daily value... but uh... forget it for a day, yeah? :D  i ordered the CRAZY CHICKEN (using egg whites) omelet ... large pieces of delicious tender chicken with lots of avocados topped with muenster cheese and sour cream. it is HUGE... .and comes with a large side of fruit (or some other side if you wish) ...and...  HOMEMADE BANANA NUT MUFFIN!! SOOO DELICIOUS!!! =99999 yes, it comes free! =)  service was impeccable.. waitress was so nice to us and made sure we were satisfied. she's the one with the chinese lettering tattoos on her right and left wrists. if you see her, you know she'll treat you well!!   total was $24. that's much cheaper than eating not so great buffet food for one person! i've never had such a great breakfast/brunch experience in vegas until now...thanks egg works!!   OH! FREE UNLOCKED WI-FI. =)"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant. The food here is amazing and very flavorful. My waitress Cassandra was great and recommended that I try the hot chocolate with butterscotch liqueur. It was the best hot chocolate I've had! This restaurant is a must go to for breakfast and lunch."}

{"text":"As the dog jumps up on the bed, my brain screams out in agony. Opening my bleary eyes slams sunlight in from the window. I want to pull the pillow over my head to shield myself from the world, but the dog insists. As I roll over to try and fall to the floor gracefully, I realize that I'm still wearing my clothes from Saturday night. My shirt is drenched in sweat and twisted sideways and my right arm is asleep.  After shoving the dog out the door, my belly growls and my head pounds. I know there is but one hope to salvaging the day. After a full glass of water and a small handful of aspirin, I wander out to my car and find my way to Egg Works.  Parking is always a bit of a challenge on Sunday mornings, but fortunately not today. I park around the corner and stagger to the door. Just inside, I'm greeted by the glorious smell of breakfast goodness and a cheery hostess. She asks my name and surprises me with an estimated 5 minute wait. I take a seat on the bench by the window and try to look a bit less disheveled (unsuccessfully)  Moments later, the hostess calls my name and I groan a bit as I stand to follow her. My table is a two seater by the window, a little too bright for my sensitive eyes, but that's not their fault. The menu is a newspaper filled with lots of breakfast, and lunch options. I choose quickly from their list of Bennies (several variations on the classic Eggs Benedict) To help easy my pain, I also order coffee, which is left in the carafe on the table should I feel the need to chug four cups before my meal.  Now hang overs are just your body's way of slowing you down so it can catch up. The critical components are hydration, caffeination, and nutration (or nutrition if you like) Egg works can help with all of these. One special shout out to the potatoes, which should be illegal due to their addictive flavor.  One other note, y'all don't have to wait until your shakin off the effects of Jager bombs, or returning from Sunday services to come by - the service is fast enough that you can swing through here on your way to work, school, DMV, voting, airport, etc.  Oh, and if your wondering, I did survive that day, though it did make me pause for a few nights before I could look at anything served in a tiny glass or with a twist top. I've probably not learned my lesson, but then again, Egg Works is always ready to nurse me back to human."}
{"text":"I've gone to this location about 3 or 4 times already, and I tried to keep returning to see if it would live up to the hype. Maybe I'm just not ordering the right things but my boyfriend and I both get disappointed each time we come here. The banana nut muffin is always dried out and does not taste fresh. Service is always hit or miss. And the food in comparison to other places like the cracked egg, it just doesn't measure up. I got stuffed French toast which was decent but again, nothing compared to the one at the cracked egg. The chicken fried steak skillet was more gravy than anything else... I think I enjoyed Denny's more than the egg works version. And lastly I tried the pork benny. It wasn't bad but you definitely have to have a certain \"taste\" to order that. It was very unique and different from anything I've had.. but I had a hard time finishing it with the mountain of the smokey bbq sauce slathered every where. I love their potatoes because they are seasoned well and full of flavor. I usually can't order country potatoes but they're so good here it's the one thing I can compliment. After 4 visits here, I don't think I'll be returning. I guess it lives up to the hype for some people, but for someone who loves breakfast I'd rather get it in a place with better customer service and friendlier helpful staff."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointing.   Based on Yelp reviews I selected Eggs Works for Sunday brunch for my daughter and me. Oh boy!  It was busy but we were seated immediately. Our server wasn't quick but the initial wait wasn't too bad. However, the server seemed a little abrupt. We decided to give her the benefit of the doubt as we were hungry so maybe it was OUR perception. haha  But no. Each time she was distracted and less than present. She wasn't mean or nasty, just not fully engaged. We often had to flag down another server for drink refills or other needs. By the end of our meal she hadn't been seen in twenty minutes and we had to hail yet another staff member for to go boxes. (Incidentally, we were not the only ones. We saw other tables going to the hostess stand for help.)  The food was fine. I didn't get to try the muffins as the server neglected to bring mine, but the omelets we ordered were not bad. The potatoes were over salted, but I don't like salt so that could have just been me. Coffee was good and strong.   Overall, the restaurant was loud and dirty, we heard drops and breaks multiple times. I'm ok cutting some slack for Sunday brunch being busy but for a breakfast restaurant, they were struggling. I was pretty disappointed and given the number of other options available, likely won't be back."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!! Super nice staff and if it's your first time you get a free banana muffin !!!!! AMAZING FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice and clean. The service was awesome and the food was great I had the Mexican omelet which was fantastic. They made us feel very comfortable. I bought an offer on Groupon and had money left over and the manager gave me a gift. I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Really good eggs and potatoes. I'd recommend the pork carnitas it was great on my breakfast skillet."}
{"text":"Jennifer was a great waitress. Really caring and attentive to our table.she helped us out in everything we needed I ordered the Mexican omelette and it was delicious. Thank you so much because of here it's been our best experience here. Manager super friendly as well"}
{"text":"This place is seriously fantastic. Basically my go-to breakfast or lunch spot! I usually get the chile rellanos omelet and it's delicious every single time. I'm typically a creature of habit when it comes to food, but I have found it real easy to branch out and try something new with all the different menu options, both breakfast and lunch. The service is always fast and friendly and the food is always amazing. Whenever I have any family in town, I always take them here knowing it will be a great dining experience for them while on vacation. Even my 1 year old likes it here! I will order him a side of avocado and give him bite of the delicious fresh baked banana nut muffins. They even make sure to give him another straw after he's thrown his previous one on the floor for the hundredth time! And to top it off, it's only a short drive from my house.  Great food, friendly, prompt service, wonderful menu options, kid-friendly and convenient. No wonder this place is always busy! I can't wait to be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast. Great food and coffee. Our waitress Taylor was so sweet and attentive . Def a must for breakfast in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"This is a great locals' breakfast spot in Vegas. In a nutshell---  Pros- Great comfort food with large portions, casual atmosphere that is great for the kids, typically you get friendly service from the staff, you can call ahead and order to go if you don't want to deal with the crowds.  Cons- It's usually busy and there's a wait. Also, the parking absolutely sucks. It's hard to find a spot....  For this visit, I ordered an egg salad salad sandwich. The bread was toasted to perfection and the egg salad was delicious. My daughters French Toast was wonderful as well as our groups other two orders. I love the fries here! They're really skinny fries loaded with salty seasoning!! YUM!   My tip for this place is to just call ahead your order and get it to go. Then you don't have to deal with the crowds. :)"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town with the best sever ever. Raul is attentive, courteous, and funny.  Skipping out on egg works is the worst mistake since running a stop in front of cop.  Food is scrumptious and massive! If you don't get the Santa Cruz burrito you are nuts.  Ten out of ten!  Great job this morning! Whoop whoop!"}
{"text":"Hostess and employees are very friendly.  Great menu to choose from.  Horrible lighting, very cute painting on wall, the food is not bad, but for the price...it should be better.  I doubt I'll eat here again.   I just didn't get that warm fuzzy \"I want to eat breakfast\" cozy feeling."}
{"text":"Everything was great, even on a sunday brunch when it was packed inside the host made sure to come check on us every so often.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a delicious breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"So Good. My kids love this place. Our favorite is the Banana Bread, Prime rib benny and their kids meals. They have a groupon deal all the time so watch out for it. They also give military discount. Servers are really good and friendly."}
{"text":"Donna and the entire staff was great.  Three different waitresses asked if they could provide us drinks or take our order, food came out fast and Hot."}
{"text":"Bought Groupon for this place. Love breakfast  food and was excited to try it out. The menu looked awsome! Had to wait a bit but food was so worth it and Donna our waitress was awsome! The homemade banana  muffins  where a hit with my family. We will return on our next visit to Las vegas.Thank you again Donna for your exceptional  service!"}
{"text":"THE best place for breakfast food. Beats IHOP, Dennys, etc etc out of the water. Servers are very attentive and friendly...Just flip the egg! Environment is clean and they also have tvs around the restaurant tuned to news and sports.   Recomendations:   Opt for the banana muffin instead of toast! I typically hate muffins but this muffin is out of this universe. It has a strong aroma and taste of banana and you can also physically see the nuts in them.  The Works Omelette: Loaded with all different kinds of meat and vegetables. Comes with their works potato which is a must have.  Country Fried Steak: A GIGANTIC slab of chicken fried steak and drizzled with soo much gravy. The gravy is creamy and savory and pairs perfectly with the fried steak."}
{"text":"Inexpensive and pretty good. As a Paleo eater, it can be difficult to eat at restaurants but you can't go wrong with some eggs, sausage, veggies, and they'll always give you a side of avocado if you ask.   I usually get a skillet, which is eggs, meat, veggies, some cheese and fried potatoes. It's delicious. I have a friend who tried their pizza and declared it absolutely horrible. Surprise! It's called Egg Works, not Pizza Works. Don't come here expecting mastery of baked goods unless those goods are dedicated breakfast items. Since most of their dishes revolve around the same ingredients as my skillet combined in new and interesting ways, I feel safe in presuming that since my skillet is good all the other things will be relatively good as well.  My biggest complaint against this place is that when you ask for an egg over-medium, you're going to get over-hard. It boggles my mind that a place that specializes in EGGS can't properly cook an egg. C'est la vie."}
{"text":"Not great but not terrible. Just run-of-the-mill quality food at typical prices. The food isn't bad tasting, but it surely isn't the highest quality. On the flip side, it isn't trying to be. Egg Works embraces its mediocrity and prices appropriately.  I will almost definitely eat here again because eating eggs is surely healthier than being lazy and eating donuts, for example, but the food is just okay, and the 3-star is labeled \"A-OK\" by Yelp! so that must be the one I have to pick."}
{"text":"Amy was an awesome server! Even in the middle of a huge rush of customers, she always had a smile in her face and made sure everything was going really well!! Great atmosphere and great food! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast,  and the service is amazing. You don't leave hungry thats for sure. Yummy stuff..."}
{"text":"I pop in here from time to time to enjoy what is normally a not so healthy breakfast.  I have tried some of the lunch items but breakfast...anything breakfast is my meal of choice.  On my last outing I tried a a bacon omelet stuffed with garlic mashed potatoes topped with cheese and dap of sour cream.  The happy egg, sad egg thing is no joke!    If your coffee cup runneth empty, or your need a side of hollandaise to liven up your meal, don't bother trying to flag down the busy servers.  FLIP the egg and watch them come a running."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood breakfast.    Their banana muffin really does change your life, my family loves it. Their pancakes are soft and puffy and just melt away in your mouth, the deliciousness I tell you.   Anyhow, staff is accessible and helpful. They make up for the line you might encounter a Sunday morning when it's their rush hour."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience for Saturday Brunch here. This place looks pretty unassuming as it's located in a strip mall, but the food and service was fantastic.   It was a 10-15 minute wait for a table but found 2 spots at the bar right away. We had the funniest and most upbeat server at the bar, I think his name was PK. He kept us laughing the entire time we were there. The rest of the crew was nice and they looked happy to be there! I ordered a mimosa - they give you your own little bottle of champagne with a side of OJ to mix yourself which is great as I only prefer a small amount of OJ. We also got 2 free banana muffins which were to die for.  And the food! So good! It came out super fast and hot. The veggie Benny was amazing as well as the Mexican omelette.   HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"After a poor service performance last night @ another eatery, this morning was a home run with our server, Amanda!  She was spot on with EVERYTHING...the food was delivered super quick..she anticipated our needs before asking, and had a delightful personality!! Well played, Egg Works, hold onto Amanda..she is definately an asset to your business!"}
{"text":"Very fast service and overall fairly good food. I ordered the traditional eggs Benedict and felt it was a bit too over sauced.The hollandaise sauce just smothered everything which personally is a bit overwhelming since you can't taste anything besides the sauce. I like to taste eat nuance in food. Next time I'll ask for hollandaise on the side.  Their home fries are really good and its sprinkled with some paprika or something, but taste really good. The banana nut muffin you get for checking in is pretty good and I don't like banana nut stuff!"}
{"text":"Frequent this location often.  Food is delicious and service is typically great, there have been a few cases of poor/slow service when seated outside or in a corner.  Consistency of the eggs could use some work though.  One day you ask for over medium and the white is still runny, next time it might be ok.  This has been brought to managements attention in the past but still continues to be an issue sometimes.  I will return since it is a short walk from my house so hopefully they can get it straight one day"}
{"text":"Donna was awesome! The food was fantastic! Free banana nut muffins for the newcomers to boot!"}
{"text":"Maryann was our server, and I have to say, BEST SERVER EVER!!! Like OMG this place is the best breakfast place I've ever been to EVER. The food was BOMB, the service was SUPER, and the server we had specifically, Maryann, wqs the beat server I've ever had at any restaurant EVER!"}
{"text":"Ive been to Egg Works twice. Definitely could tell the difference with the service. Tamara is the best server ever. She is just everything you could want, very friendly, very attentive and remembered me after only one time being there. I couldn't wait to get back and eat a second helping of the banana nut french toast. However the server I had the second time around was very inattentive and got my drink wrong multiple times and it felt like I got passed around to multiple servers. I understand that it was probably the end of most shifts, however the little things still matter."}
{"text":"We were wary of Egg Works because, as an extension of Egg and I... well, it's just not the original, right?! Well, immediately on being seated Chelsea greeted us warmly, making us feel welcome. It's the same menu, but could it be as good?  I'm here to say, YES! The Ensenada Burrito (my first try) was awesome! Eggs and carnitas, mmm! What made it though was the sauce... a perfectly balanced tomatillo sauce, not too vinegar-y; very flavorful. The service too was spot on, with perfect checks of our experience without interrupting conversation (a pet peeve of mine).  We will definitely be back. Oh, definitely don't pass up their banana nut muffin! Delicious! Also comes in loaf form!"}
{"text":"Great food and even greater service. Our server was Veronica and was a sweetheart! Super friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great prices and staff is super friendly and attentive! This is my go to place for breakfast/brunch! The fruit is fresh and their omelettes are the best! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Somehow I am always disappointed when I come to this location, if they don't mess up my guests older then it's mine. I ordered a bacon/avocado omelette with cheddar and jack cheese off of their menu, I also add green peppers/onions  but once I get my omelette it's only green peppers and onions. Side from that the omelette was cold, but at least they got my boyfriends skillet correct. I always come back because they have a great menu to choose from but if I'm going to pay almost $4 for plain orange juice and have them constantly mess up my order then I'll just go to another place instead."}
{"text":"Bambi, belongs at Disney! Our server Bambi was great. The food is pretty great too! Last two times we were there we got lucky we got the same server."}
{"text":"I wanted to rate this restaurant higher because the food was delicious but we waited so long for our food I just couldn't give it a 4. In fact after we waited for 45 minutes they brought 3 of our meals but didn't bring the 4th meal for another 10 minutes. The manager was nice and took one meal off our ticket and gave us a loaf of bread to take home with us. So they did their best the rectify the situation but it was frustrating to wait that long. I got the Sundance omelet and it was delicious!!! I also ordered the homestyle pancakes and they were really yummy! My husbands french toast was good too."}
{"text":"I want to give our server Monica 5 stars-she was great. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the food. Biscuits and gravy were so salty I could barely eat them. The biscuit was stale and there was no sausage in this sausage gravy. I did however find half a piece of bacon in there though."}
{"text":"Someone I work with recommended Egg Works for breakfast. So my mother and I went there. I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy with Eggs and Potatoes, and a cup of Coffee. The service was fast, very fast, so fast indeed that I wondered at the quality of the food. Sure enough it looks good, but in the taste department they came up way short! The Eggs looked like they had been mass produced and were pulled from one of those buffet style servers. The gravy tasted like it was canned and way too salty with not much hint of meat in it. The biscuit was stale!  The Potatoes, way too SALTY!!!! Smothering reheated frozen potatoes in seasoned salt doesn't cut it in my book! Finally the Coffee was decidedly bitter to both our tastes. I would not go there again!"}
{"text":"People here are really nice and they are all about customer service. Make sure to check in to get your free BOMB banana muffin. Used a groupon here for a even better deal. The potatoes are top notch. Will be coming back here soon."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! I found this place out through Groupon and we decided to go try it out for lunch today! And the service and food were great. Our waiter was super friendly as well! Very personable, you can tell he enjoys his job and making everyone happy. He definitely made us feel welcome, super funny and helpful . The staff is also very nice. The restaurant its self is very cozy, they have outdoor seating as well. There is also this little train that travels over the ceiling and it's super cute to watch!! :))"}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast. The only reason it gets 4 stars is the atmosphere is loud and you can hardly hear the person sitting across from you. Great food though!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We got to sit outside on the patio area which was just so pretty and peaceful. The food was so good and the portions are huge!  I ordered the veggie benny and my boyfriend had the chile relleno, no complaints! Would recommend to anyone, this is such a great breakfast spot. Also, their menu is huge! Even with some lunch items as well. There's something for everyone here"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast food if you want something quick and yummy. I would recommend this place. Sometimes there is a wait to get in"}
{"text":"Soooo good! I had the corn beef hash and shared biscuits and gravy too and it was just awesome. Really friendly staff and fast service. Egg works for the win!"}
{"text":"My son and I had breakfast there before school. The food was fast and fresh, and the service was quick and friendly.  Great French toast and the eggs Benedict was. Perfect."}
{"text":"First time here flew in early, my server was Hellena who exemplified excellent customer service and was very attentive. My food was bought out nice and warm, fresh and well presented. It was quick service as well. When your ready to order you flip s little egg to yellow and they come to help you. Would definately come back. Place is clean, has booths and tables or you can sit up at the bar.."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat breakfast by far. Not only are the servers friendly but the food is served in a timely manner, and the menu is diverse as well as interesting.  I've been to three separate locations and all are consistent with great service and delicious food with no attempt to hurry their patrons along."}
{"text":"First time eating here.  Our server Hector was excellent.  Great personality and very fast.  The food was spectacular.  I had the chili rellano omlet.  I'm glad I ordered something different. The sauce on top was awesome.  Looked this place up on yelp.  I was definitely not disappointed and will return.."}
{"text":"Our server Donna was eggcellent.  And so was the food. Breakfast tostada is very yummy.  Layered in a taco shell bowl.  Coffee is good.  Reuben is great as well."}
{"text":"So glad I didn't let the strip mall location scare me away from this place. It looks a little funky but the food is great. I love breakfast morning, noon or evening so I am a bit picky about my eggs. I hate them burnt. My omelette was  perfect! The coffee is delicious, but best of all the service is fantastic. So friendly and quick to serve. Great spot if you want a place off the strip and close to the airport."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The skillets are huge and always cooked with flavorful ingredients. I say always go with the muffin!! I even buy a few extra muffins to go for the upcoming week. The service is spot on, and if there is something wrong, you just switch the egg on your table from happy to sad. This location also has an awesome train display which I loved personally."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We have been here several times and always try to visit here when we are in Las Vegas. Angela was a great and attentive server! I had the classic Benny with cottage cheese,my husband had a HUGE omelet and my in-laws had a waffle combo and crepes. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"I love Egg Works/Eggs & I!! Every time I go to Vegas, eating here is a must! I usually go to the one on Flamingo Rd. but on Sunday we came to this newer location instead.  I actually like this location better because it is more spacious, and we didn't have to wait as long.  The staff was attentive and service was quick.   I got the three pigs omelette with the works potatoes, and of course, I had to get the best muddafrikkin' banana nut muffins in the world! I love their muffins! How do they make these glorious beauties? I want to know! Ahhhh! I wish they would open a location in LA. I would be there wayyyy too often."}
{"text":"We love coming here for breakfast. Always fast service and very friendly staff. And of course the food is delicious  ps the banana nut muffins are the bomb"}
{"text":"Came here with my cousin for Brunch on a Sunday, before our drive back to LA. The wait was about 15 mins and parking was easy.   Our server was Ash H. She was really friendly and offered quick service. We ordered the stuffed french toast, breakfast burrito, and the banana free muffin. Everything was really tasty and left us full for the long drive home. Of the 3 items, I liked the stuffed french toast the most because it's unique. I always have a hard time deciding between savory and sweet breakfast foods, so this was the perfect blend!   The restrooms are really clean and loved their cute theme!"}
{"text":"Love having breakfast at Egg works! Donna is our server and she is fantastic! We are always taken care of. The food is superb!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while and every time it's amazing! Love all the employees here but Lisa T. Is always so sweet and gives excellent service. If you come ask to be seated in her section. Also 30% off for EMT/AEMTS"}
{"text":"Looooong line but worth the wait.!! It's a MUST go place when in LV.!!! Friendly staff.. great food... and the mimosas ... well... WOW.!!!"}
{"text":"Our server Twila was great! Loved the omelette stuffed French toast and the Banana Bread French toast"}
{"text":"Waitress made a mistake and swapped the order between my friend and I and then told us she didn't make a mistake a repeatedly came to the table to discuss it.... Poor service."}
{"text":"Nice location, plenty of food and an toy electric train up above to distract the little kids. Good service and food quality is always satisfying.  Used to be a dead corner for this area, but now a bustling area, thanks Egg Works."}
{"text":"Chelsea R. at Eggworks on sunset was our server on 5/24 she gave very good service with a smile, food was delicious and served a lot faster than I thought it would be being that the place was packed thank you Chelsea can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"Took the initiative to Yelp a breakfast place after our basketball game and came across this place. Enjoyed the ambience of this place, very friendly, with GOOD costumer service from the greeters to the waitresses. Affordable pricing for their menu and have an array of selection for breakfast and lunch. I ordered the Denver omelette that came with a good amount of potatoes and your choice of toast or banana muffin, which I got the muffin. They were quick and efficient in making sure we got our food and didn't miss anything. I recommend this place if you are in the area and are in need of a spot to eat."}
{"text":"The service here is great! Any problem, and they will fix! We had a problem with our dish and they exchanged it and didnt charge us for our meal.  Best place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Well where do I start! Super Busy Saturday around 12:30 p.m. Sat by myself at the counter, this is my first time here. Greeted by smiling and very nice Caitlin and I got a huge tout on the Green Sauce Carnitas Huevos Rancheros with a side of Spanish Rice. I also got a complimentary Banana Nut Muffin and I also ordered Ice Tee. All this for $16.27 all in, going to tip her big as well. Freaking Awesome Food, maybe one of the most memorable breakfast / brunch experiences in a long time. Customer for Life Now"}
{"text":"Outstanding service! I ordered half order mushroom omelet with home made blueberry muffin and it was delicious. The price was very cheat for the amount we got. I like the flip cards they had on the table to signal a server to come to our table. I wish they had one in Honolulu, Hawaii"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this place and finally got to i had the spinach benny, it was super good my sister had well i cant remember i was tp busy eating my delish food, potatoes are crispy and seasoned well....if i had a complaint it would be that the kid menu needs to give more bacon lol very good food"}
{"text":"Loved this place. The workers were happy; kind and courteous something you don't get/see everyday. The menu had a great selection of dishes and they served rice. I thought the waiter was the owner he was so personable."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here. Son got the mashed potato omelette and loved it. The potatoes that came with it were so good. Even the wheat toast tasted great. I got pumpkin chocolate chip pancakes and was in heaven. Our waitress was very helpful and attentive. Used a Groupon with no problems. We will definitely be back.  Love this place."}
{"text":"This isn't really directed at Egg Works, but instead it is more me pondering the mystique of breakfast spots. I mean, there are many things I will never understand and among those is the draw these type of places seem to have. There is nothing on the menu that one could not whip up themselves. So, I just don't understand people willing to wait 30+ minutes to eat an omelet or another equally rudimentary breakfast food. So, on a handful of occasions when the wait time was not ridiculous I've had a chance to try this place. They have a large menu and their service is solid. I am also a fan of the endless coffee refills.  I have had their basic eggs breakfast, sampled several of the omelets, and most recently highly enjoyed their carnitas rancheros menu item. Everything is fine, and that is pretty much the most you can expect out of these joints...hence why I don't understand the hype or the wait times.  The food is fine, the prices are fine, the service is fine...is it worth waiting 30+ minutes for? Heck no."}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast spot in Vegas! Service is good, food is delicious, and the food comes out hot and fresh fast!"}
{"text":"Their skillets are must haves! Great food and customer service!"}
{"text":"Another horrible experience. The hostesses have no common sense on how to seat properly. We were told they couldn't sit our party altogether (12). Then put part in the far corner of the restaurant by the kitchen. Cheri (the manager) was less than understanding on putting the party altogether even though there were THREE available tables next to the rest, and no other parties waiting. The staff at this restaurant will be its demise. Training is obviously lacking, common sense is nonexistent. Courtesy is minimal. I hate coming here. BUT because of the great food friends and family always want to return."}
{"text":"my office is right up the street from this place, and i have gone on many occasions, BUT   only because there isnt much for breakfast in the area (unless you mant mcdonalds)  the food is pretty much large plates of un-inspired breakfast fare, run of the mill flavorless omeletts, biscuits and gravy and scramble plates.  the only redeeming thing about the place is they give you a pot of coffee that you can attend to your self, because the servers are too busy talking among themselves to take care of the customers!!!  i wish there was something in that area that was better!!!"}
{"text":"My second fav breakfast spot. I come for the banana nut muffins and coffee,but always order an omelette too. They all come with zesty square potatoes that are wonderful. Every time I go it's busy, and rightfully so."}
{"text":"We had the privilege of PK being our server today! He was awesome and funny and super attentive to our food requests. Everything came out just as we had asked.   When back in Henderson we will definitely be back!! Thank you PK!"}
{"text":"*BIG* Servings!!! If you are hungry and want a YUMMY breakfast COME here!   The Banana nut muffin is so delicious! This is technically your \"free\" appetizer. This is not the place for someone who is trying to keep it light - NO WAY! This is definitely for the hungry and the brave!!   I had a half serving of French toast and a half serving of the omelet with toast and hashbrowns! MY GOODNESS! Wayyyyy too much food! Hubby had the parfait and he said it was too sweet, so, I would not suggest that. All items seem to be over the top.. Super buttery toast, which was nice.. Good meal, definitely will come again and order a half of one thing only! :)"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here & this was the best so far! Victoria, our server was amazing! Awesome person, great service, & overall great personality. She really made our experience here worth it. Food was amazing."}
{"text":"Maryanne is the best server I've had at an Egg works! She is quick and attentive while working! She makes multi tasking look easy! She keeps a cheerful disposition, which always makes going out to eat an even better experience!  I noticed she was helping make sure that the toaster oven was working properly for the guests, and yet she immediately greeted me with a smile. I've always loved the food at Egg Works, but this server really exceeded all of my expectations with her attitude, and willingness to help! She even noticed that I'm a vegetarian and she made a suggestion to modify my breakfast to be more healthy! Thank you so much for making my morning!"}
{"text":"Heather was fantastic,sweet waitress fort Apache and flamingo.. more waitresses should be like Heather she was right on the ball"}
{"text":"Just awesome. Order the blk prime rib benny! And get your Muffin. Epic dish Epic service! -Server Rob was great!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to hang out with family, child friendly and very helpful staff, everyone was so nice! And the food is delicious of course, the best part? They make it exactly how you want it :)."}
{"text":"The last two mornings I have the biscuits (that's all I ever eat here) and gravy,the biscuits were stale at best and very hard to cut,something has gone very wrong with the cooking and the gravy has been less than hot,too bad it's close to my condo,I guess it's back to Black Bear a little further but always good b & G."}
{"text":"Perry did an excellent job as our server.  We had a minor problem but he took care of it right away with a smile and made sure we were happy.  Well definitely come back and recommend for a tasty breakfast."}
{"text":"Great cafe-style breakfast place with tons and tons of options. Had a fantastic breakfast here. Average price of a nice breakfast meal is about $10."}
{"text":"Best service Ive had and the server Victoria was the best. Food was on time and coffee never got cold."}
{"text":"Eat here all the time. The food and service is always top notch. Ihave been there numerous times and have never had a bad exsperience."}
{"text":"I have to say, Egg Works and their other location the Egg & I are Las Vegas sure bets. I have been going for 7 years and each year they open a new location. Their food and service is alway stellar which is hard to find in our city.  The bananna nut muffins are the best i've had. I would highly recommend all of their locations."}
{"text":"Friendly environment, cool family feel restaurant... Food was partly amazing partly oh man! But an overall fun experience.  I'll give it another try with a different menu item, cause the chorizo omelet didn't comply with my expectations."}
{"text":"One of my go to places for coffee and food. My server Divina is awesome and quick. Love this place."}
{"text":"PERRY WAS A KNOCK OUT!!!! Thank you for your service and attentiveness to our orders! We had a blast."}
{"text":"Nicole was awesome! Never had better service anywhere. Love eating at this location. I've eaten at pretty much every Egg Works in town but this one is by far my favorite. Awesome food, friendly environment. Couldn't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times, and it gets better every time!! I really love croissants, so I order an egg dish called Sunrise Mountain. It's topped with loads of melted cheese over scrambled eggs and your choice of meat. A classic dish, but they make it taste unique with their special potatoes (probably unhealthy, but very tasty). The serving sizes are way too big, but I like having leftovers in the fridge.   The service is great, too. If you ever need anything, you just flip this cute little egg over and someone comes to your table right away. You can tell it's a popular place by the sheer number of customers and workers. Restaurant could probably use more space."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast! Pictures speak for us! Soooo good  I had the Huevos rancheros with the pork Carnitas and the fruit salad, and my hubby got the scrambled ham egg and cheese stuffed French toast, everything was amazing! Our server Anna was also a sweetheart! Great spot, we only had to wait five minutes for the table, well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Thank you Veronica great service! Fast and friendly service and great food! The perfect breakfast on a weekend morning."}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience I've ever had. I guess it can be expected when you're paying $6 for breakfast. Sh*tty play with s*hitty service"}
{"text":"We always go to this location. It's the best for family breakfast or even if you want something quick. Jamie was our server and she's always so friendly when we come in. Try the Chili Relleno Omelet,  it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Stop through Vegas on a little R & R. I'm a Yelper so I did my search and came across Egg Works Flamingo. Read a few reviews and was convinced that this was the \"go to\" spot. As my Yelping fate would have it, I discovered the best breakfast place on this side of the country. I received EXCEPTIONAL service from the beautiful Maria G. She was attentive, extremely friendly and provided very efficient service. I highly, highly recommend this place. The people were friendly and the food was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast. The food is always delicious and our server Jay was great. He made our experience great and we enjoyed our time"}
{"text":"I've been here before years ago and remember it being really great so today my friend and I drove by it and waited until opening to dine there. SUPER great service and the worker who seated us/took our order was very friendly and outgoing. Plan to be coming by here more often. Eggcellent service"}
{"text":"This is a good place to have breakfast.  Professional and courteous service.  This is one of the few places that offers Veterans's discount.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Been  minute since I've \"yelped\" the good kind not the screaming kind.  So, I've been to the Eggs&I which is great and we wanted somewhere that was opposite of crazy vegas traffic (so off the strip we go!)   We were promptly seated by Ashley.  Drinks:  Bailey & Joe (7.50) great drink but a bit smaller 2than expected O.j. (3.25) its hard to go wrong on oj except at micky ds.  Food:  Mexixan crepe (half portion @ 7.05)  -chorizos and good stuff..yumm and filling! grateful that it was half and not overly stuffed (thank you ashley!)  Side of bacon (3pcs @ 3.60) -hard to go wrong with bacon..  Loco Moco (9.25) -gravy over eggs meat and rice good but filling... (i need kimchi with this)  Banana nut muffin (side with dishes) -at first i thought it was a bit dry.. til Ashley showed me the way with butter.. (but anything with butter makes everything better ) turned out to be moist with flavor! hey its a new magic trick!  overall food and service was great! ashley showed the way gave opinions and answered little questions we asked.  Wish places in L.A. was like this ;(  Can't wait til our next visit!"}
{"text":"Finally came here to eat for the first time today.  Portions are very generous.  I ordered the crepes thinking I was going to get a light dish. Instead I got a very large and thick omelet that contained mounds of stuff.  I ate small portions of the egg because it was too greasy for me. The cubed potatoes were flavorful and crispy.  But don't let the \"crepes\" description fool you. It's an omelet. A really, big and thick omelet."}
{"text":"Giant servings, cozy home-cooked flavors, more than decent prices. Totally in love with their loco moco. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Was in town last month and went here for breakfast.  Omg, loved it.. The banana muffins were so good, and Donna was the best!!!  She went over and beyond to serve our picky party of five.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I will truly drop by..Keep doing what you do Donna and thanks a bunch.."}
{"text":"Not bad for a little breakfast and lunch spot. I have been there twice and enjoyed multiple dishes"}
{"text":"So I wanted to try a new breakfast place, even though it felt like I was cheating on blueberry hill...and I was ashamed.  The service was pretty awful, we has to ask for a coffee refill 3 times from our first cup. Then we had to ask for creamer 3 different times and sugar 3 different times. And all from different waiters. Ok fine, the food should be awesome. Let's stick it out.  No. It wasn't fine. It was maybe mediocre at best. I got a veggie skillet that required me to dig through the lukewarm eggs and quagulated cheese to find. Don't boast of a \"totally loaded veggie skillet!!!\" that had two mushrooms in it, a bit of tomatoes, no onions, and a few skimpy bell peppers. Worst ever. Did I mention the cold, sorta melted cheese that stuck together like glue? Ugh.  Then I needed more coffee and knew it was time to go.  I will not be going back, nor should you.  I'm not gonna go back to my regular place and beg for forgiveness."}
{"text":"I decided to give Egg Works another try, even though I didn't like the one on Sunset and Eastern, because ...I don't know because I was hungry!  This place was much better than its other locations.  We were actually greeted and seated like regular people, our order was taken quickly, our drinks were refilled, and the food came out fast.  I ordered the bacon and avocado omelette and it was pretty good.  But the most amazing thing ever about this place was their potatoes.  mmmmmm.  Real good stuff!  Not too bad an experience, food was ok overall, and it lost a star because we had to ask for silverware a few times.  However, unlike the other location, I would probably go back here for a quick and cheap bite to eat because honestly, I LOVE my breakfast food!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times trying to give them a fair chance, but at the end of the day, it's only a 3 star place at best. The food came out relatively fast, and was hot, but wasn't a fan of their muffins or corned beef hash and eggs. For the price I expected more."}
{"text":"Donna is AWESOME! Great service! Slight miscommunication by the chefs but she took care of it immediately!  Assistant manager checked on us several times.  Food was so good as always!  Thx guys!!"}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that this location was supposed to be a johnny carinos italian and i am still bitter about that, i kept an open mind when walking in to egg works. The owners clearly dont have an ounce of designer in them and basically massacred what should have been a warm inviting interior by painting the walls bright white and ruining the beamed tray ceiling by adding stark ceiling tiles and fluorescents everywhere. If you want an ounce of ambience with your dining experience skip this place. We had a two for one coupon which actually only had a value of $8 which was a buck or two less than the cost of their breakfasts offered so not really two for one. i got the country benny and my hubby got the chicken fried steak. He liked his real well, my eggs were runny and the whites undercooked even though i ordered them over medium. The works potatoes were a disappointment too as the name implies loaded goodness but the actual side was deemed \" the chicklet potatoes\" as they were tiny square hard fried dry potatoes covered in paprika and seasoning salt. The one bright thing was the waitress who was cheerful and quick. I would stick to mimis or cracked egg both around the corner."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot and please don't forget the banana muffin!!! Just a warm wholesome atmosphere and country feel."}
{"text":"Amazinggg breakfast place. We had the vegetarian option that they suggested. It was spicy omelette with jalapeño and cheese stuffed inside. The spicy potatoes along with it were delicious.  And their banana muffin was out of the world. I loved this place!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was wonderful, as always! I had the carnitas omelet special, and couldn't finish it. It was big enough for 3 people, and was so good that I are way more than I should have. Our server, Candice, was great - friendly, fast, and checked in on us just the right amount!"}
{"text":"Great yummy food! Craving breakfast in the afternoon on the weekend this is the place. And great service by Brandy she was sweet and provided exceptional service!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have gone here three times and the food is consistently great with good quality and great portions. They do not skimp on the egg works fries here or the portion sizes."}
{"text":"I love Eggworks! Definitely get the stuffed French toast, and hope you have the good fortune to have Caitlin as your server"}
{"text":"We come here before I head off to my day job.  The coupons in the papers help a bunch with our frequent outings.  I cannot say enough about their service and how outstanding a job they do.   We did have a moment on a busy weekend where nobody addressed giving us any service.  Even the egg flipped to the bright yellow egg (notice to the servers that the customer needs something) wasn't getting noticed.  I do believe the manager came by and did everything in his power to help us.  He went above and beyond to help us out.  I have seen him do this from time to time and I do applaud him on his ability to pitch in and make it right.  So for what few times when we had issues the staff was on the ball and made it right.   The waitresses are friendly and found one who even threw back the sarcastic humor. If there is a wait, its worth it and shouldn't take to long to be seated.  Although sitting outside with all the planes landing does get noisy. Love the pumpkin chocolate chip pancakes!"}
{"text":"The chile relleno and italian omlettes are the bomb. Opt for the banana nut muffin as well. Tasty! While the potatos are quite good, if you choose fresh fruit, they serve up 5 big slabs of melon, pineapple, watermelon, and grapefruit. Cant beat it. I avoid the hotel and strip restaurants like the plague because I do not want to deal with lines and I am not too keen on paying 3x for a meal that can be had a few minutes away.....and usually better!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here with our two little guys and we consider it a great choice. We were seated immediately, served quickly and the food was good. We ordered the standard eggs benny (yummy though hollandaise was different without the traditional tang, but still tasty), the santa cruz breakfast burrito (which had an awesome tasty sauce drizzled over it), and a waffle with strawberries and whipped cream (super tasty, kid said better than mom makes and I wasn't offended). While we waited our waiter brought out banana nut muffins that our kids loved. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I arrived at 11:42 am and this place was packed to the rim and real busy too.  There were those guys in front me and said \"2 and first able seats\" and the lady said \" it's going to be about 35-40 mins wait time\" and ask for their cell phone to text them when the table came able. So many people waiting to be seated but since I was a one person, I was able get a seat at the counter.  I was able get the corner counter and be service pretty quickly. OMG bad idea to come on 11:45 am to lunch time and real busy and so many people waiting. After 5 mins, she took my order of coffee with my French Vanilla creamer, Waffle with 2 scramble eggs and ham. I waited about 20 mins for my meal to be served. They were so back up in the kitchen and about 12:20 pm the ticket service shut down and no tickets to be enter for about 15 mins. But I was lucky I got my bill prior to the shut down.   So my bill was $14.29 all together without the muffin ( add $1.95 for the muffin to the bill).    Over all I'm very happy and my stomach is totally Satisfied.  If the counter is able on very busy day, up to 4 people together nicely.  If not, you'll need to waiting Patiently!!  It's worth the time and effort!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to egg works for years and it is still my favorite breakfast place. The food here is always great and I always recommend to eat here. Today Roslin was super friendly and even told us how there are now new breakfast items. She was friendly the whole visit."}
{"text":"We've been going to this location for a couple of years and in all that time there is only one visit where the food was a little slow. And to be fair, it was packed with a waiting line. Our visit today was as eggceptional as we have come to expect. The hostess seated us right away and our Server Donna was right there to welcome us and take our beverage order. She was attentive and funny and we enjoyed talking to her. The food was its usual eggcellent. You must try the banana nut bread or muffin!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Our waitress Brigette was very friendly and accommodating. Make sure you request for her when u go there. There is nothing bad to say about this place!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast.Once in awhile I get lunch,but I love there breakfast menu :) the classic is always simple and yummy,or there ciabatta sandwich :)"}
{"text":"We dine here regularly and on this occasion for lunch, our server, Reina delivered a most enjoyable experience. Her attention to detail, friendliness, and obvious love for her job made our visit better than ever !!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Got the cheese steak sandwich and Chile relleno yum... Service is great,  friendly and attentive. Food was egg-cellent!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot for comfort food. This is not the place for anyone looking for low calorie cuisine. Pancakes and omelets are great. You should also ask for the muffin. It is banana goodness."}
{"text":"EGGstatic there's a new breakfast joint that just opened up here in the Anthem area in the strip mall along Eastern between Horizon Ridge and Sunridge Heights.  I just did a quick glance of the menu but wasn't feeling any of their omelette selections till the  breakfast Hawaiian style section caught my eye! They offered 3 different meals; Spam or Portuguese Sausage with rice and eggs, Loco Moco( eggs, rice burger patty topped w/brown gravy)  and the Haole Moco (Westernized version with country gravy)  I went for the Haole one!   It was made right with rice on the bottom, layered with the burger patty and topped with gravy and 2 eggs.  I  just I didn't like the burger patty as much. I also thought more gravy is needed because the rice soaked it all up before I could finish it.  Otherwise not too bad.  Afterthoughts:  I should've ordered something on the lighter side.   The place is plenty big, bright and airy.  There is seating outside facing the busy street. Or you can sit at the counter or seat yourself in their large dining area.  The windows facing west has a nice view of the Anthem area.   Minor hiccups on service.  I seated myself (per sign at entry) and waited a few minutes till someone realized I wasn't being waited on yet. A server approached my table when she realized I wasn't helped yet and apologized for me being the only one there at the time and the 12 of them not tending to my table yet. Maybe because everyone is still green or it was still too early in the day, who knows.  I don't mind that they give you the check right away and you pay at the counter at your convenience but it is a pain and I do think the \"flip to yellow egg\" for help/service system is pretty lame.  I like that this place opens pretty early and they offer different choices for breakfast and brunch time and look forward to trying more food from their menu, but I have to say I still prefer the breakfast bakery cafe that has that savory waffle sandwich and Chopped Kale salad across the way."}
{"text":"I was debating on whether to go and check this place out, having read good and bad reviews. My dad had gone and said it was great, large menu and good food.  We went this past Saturday and it was just average in food.  Service was terrible and the waitress had absolutely no personality or real desire to be there.  Looking around, I didn't see too many smiles on the staff's faces.  Yes, it was busy in there and it was loud but just didn't have a good feel about it, despite the cute decore.  The banana muffins were really good but that's about it. My daughter and I both had upset stomachs afterwards. We won't be going again when there's other places that have better food, better service and more reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Went to this place the the day and was STARVING. I got the Cabo Breakfast Burrito - super yummy! The potatoes were perfect: crisp and well-seasoned just like breakfast potatoes should be. I also had a bite of banana muffin which was warm and tasty. They use good orange juice, not the crappy kind. I couldn't finish my meal because I was too full and debating about Kony 2012 with my friends, but if it weren't for Kony, I probably would have tried to finish it. Effing Kony, dude....   Our service was kind of slow, but it seemed like our waitress was just having one of those days where her mind was in a jumble. She was nice, so I don't count it against her. She made sure to bring me OJ to-go in a cup.   Oh! The menu is a newspaper! I wanted to keep it but our waitress asked for it back. It is pretty unique and also fulfills the pun quota you would \"eggs-pect\" from a restaurant called \"Egg Works.\"   The bill came out to be around $16/person before tip. I think it was worth it for a lazy weekend breakfast. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm a couple months late on posting this but my girlfriend and I took her parents here on Mother's Day. Being Mother's Day, we expected the place to be crowded and kinda expected a bit of a wait for a table. Surprisingly, we ended up getting a seat pretty quickly. The servers were great and the food was excellent! But the main reason why I give this place 5 stars is because of a particular moment involving the servers and management! Again, being Mother's Day, we expected a bit of a wait for our food which was absolutely fine because we were in no rush. After ordering our food, my girlfriend's parents' food came out pretty fast but my girlfriend and I's food took a little longer. Like I said, we were in no rush so we were totally fine with waiting on food because the place was absolutely packed but our server kept coming over and apologizing that we didn't have our food yet. Once our food did come out, our server apologized again. And then while we were eating this delicious food, a manager came over and apologized once more about the wait and ever gave us 50% off our bill. I don't know if it was because of Mother's Day or this is how the treat all of their customers but I was beyond satisfied with this place and have been recommending Egg Works to everyone since then!"}
{"text":"Amazing home style breakfast. I come here every time I am in Vegas. This location is better than the Vegas locations. Some people might not want to drive to Henderson but it's worth it. The stuff French toast with sausage is my favorite."}
{"text":"walked up with 6 people for breakfast - sat us in less than 5 minutes.  Breakfast - Wonderful!!  Six people, six different entrees, six very happy satisfied diners.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  I had scrambled eggs & ham sandwiched between two pieces of french toast.    Only problem - I could finish it all."}
{"text":"Cheers to such a hearty breakfast. I was in love when I saw they serve loco moco and spam!! Best experience was Donna our waiter. Her customer service was excellent and such a friendly vibe to her. Made my breakfast great. Eggs were on point, great sausage links and rice was awesome. Definitely will come back here"}
{"text":"Mary Ann was excellent server I will ask for her again .the banana muffin was to die for.thefood was excellent will return."}
{"text":"First time at here and I thought the food was excellent. I was not rushed and. The service was great.  The menu is large and there are several items I want to try so I will be going back very soon.  I would have given them five stars except while checking out the there were issues with the connection when paying with a credit card."}
{"text":"Chelsea was greatlove the works Benny, happy helpful employees"}
{"text":"There is a huge menu. Lots of omelets, crepes (crepes are made witha very thin layer of egg), waffles, sandwiches, and more. I started my meal with a banana muffin. It was large enough to be a meal by itself. Moist and very delicious. They accommodate changes in the menu items including half orders, egg whites only, etc. Service is  consistently friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Always the best breakfast in Vegas for the price! We usually get the huevos rancheros and the works skillet. Both are to die for and their breakfast potatoes are the best I've ever had. They put some sort of seasoning on them that is crazy good! My girlfriend and I both get crazy full and each get a drink for about $25 plus tip. Can't beat that... Missing one star cuz the service is sometimes a little shabby. Food? Awesome tho"}
{"text":"5 star breakfast great service by Darlin."}
{"text":"Great food & prices. Their banana muffins are legendary! We had the best waitress - Rossy. She was amazing; friendly, knowledgeable & quick. Hope she wins a trip to Disneyland ."}
{"text":"Really great food and good value for money. Tv's for sports fans and lots of seating. I cleaned the plate. Great muffins too and the breakfast potatoes were some of the best I ever had dir to flavor."}
{"text":"We ordered kids mouse pancakes which were really cool my wife ordered a Reuben and I ordered waffles,  egg works isn't only about breakfast but sandwiches are awesome to.  Then they top it off with excellent service,thank you Rachael !! for taking care of us and giving us a great Sunday brunch!!!"}
{"text":"Eggsellent food and eggsellent service! Haha couldn't help myself. Really though, Danielle was an awesome server, and the food is always great."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a 'I'm skipping yoga today so lets go get breakfast'.  :-)   This place was hopping! It was around 9am so I was anticipating that.  I was keeping my fingers crossed for a short wait time.  Luckily it was only 5 minutes and I actually think we waited less than that. The place itself has many many tables inside and also an outdoor patio seating for those nice Vegas days.    One of the ladies came over right away to get our drink order.  Turns out she wasn't our waitress so it was nice that they all chip in a help each other out.  I'm sure they know people love their morning coffee as soon as they can get it!   Since i ordered coffee, she left a full carafe with us.  This is great since i drink coffee quickly.  Shortly after our actual waitress came to take our order.  I decided on the Country Benny and the hubs went with the breakfast burrito.    Food is here already??!   It came out quickly, which makes me happy (and my stomach!).   The country benny was great! Biscuit layered with sausage, eggs and topped with country gravy.  Can you feel the calories? It was a great combination of breakfast items topped with a very flavorful gravy.  My only issue was the sausage used.  Almost seemed like it was microwaved for 10 seconds.  Hmmm.  But the rest of the dish was wonderful.   My husband's burrito was fabulous.  I had a little taste and wished I had ordered that.  It was filled with eggs, bacon, potatoes, onions and cheese.  Salsa was on the side.  The burrito was huge and was surprised he finished it all!    Both of our meals had a side of breakfast potatoes.  When I say a side...  I mean a heaping pile of Idaho!   I think we could have split one side for the two of us.  They were fantastic.  Crispy with a great seasoning of YUM.    What I thought was cute was their little black or yellow eggs faces on the tables.  You can change it to yellow when you need attention at your table.   It beats trying to wave down a waitress.    Per my check in - I was Egg-cited to try it and happy we did!  We had so much for breakfast we were full until dinner.  Can't wait to come back and try something else!...   Someone at a close table ordered blueberry pancakes and they looked amazing!  Think that will be next!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family one busy Sunday weekend. 1/2 of us have been here, 1/2 were first timers. Chris, our server, was very friendly upon meeting him. We had all our phones displaying our free banana nut muffin from yelp. He was excited for our first timers, and so he brought out a muffin for everybody, and then one on the house for to-go, for the first timers. Thought it was a nice gesture and especially since the muffin is sooooo delicious, it was real kind of him. He came to our table often to ensure everything was okay, refilled drinks and coffee in a timely manner. Food was, as always, real good. So no complaints there. But the comment here is to really acknowledge Chris, our awesome server (:"}
{"text":"MARIA was our server, and she was so friendly, helpful and attentive (w/o being overbearing).  Had the Brad's Scramble (changed to have onions, mushrooms, spinach and avocado).  It was XLNT!!  The potatoes were seasoned to perfection...so flavorful!  Will DEFINITELY go back when next we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. Overpriced. I don't like it when mugs are placed upside down directly on the \"clean\" table. Service was good. Everyone enjoyed their eggs. I ordered a sandwich. Ehh. Chairs are uncomfortable. No booths. And it seems very loud. So, nope....I won't be back."}
{"text":"We waited less than 5 minutes during a peak hour. The food was delicious and the menu had a ton of different choices. Great service."}
{"text":"First time here and our expectations were a little high from reading all the other reviews. Our expectations were met!  This place was a little crowded and the seating is slightly cramped but it's well worth it. Guess you'd call it cozy. Service was great!  Quick and friendly. Never waited for anything. Cabo breakfast burrito was amazing!  Haven't  had a breakfast this good in soooo long!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in Vegas. I met a friend here on a week day and it was still packed!  The service is always pretty good.  The food portions are huge, so if you aren't hungry enough to eat 4-6 eggs, be prepared for a Togo box. Or get the half portion.  I like their bloody Mary's and mimosas. Bloody Mary mix is hablo Diablo and it's delicious. So good I don't even know if they actually put vodka in the drink. The mimosas are probably check champagne but they also used fresh squeezed oj. All about the mixers baby!  Their muffins are so good. Sometimes they come out before your food. Sometimes with your food. Sometimes after your food... just depends on how good or busy your server is. Get the house potatoes with extra seasoning and extra crispy and thank me later.   My go to is usually an omelette. They're huge and delicious and packed with veggies and protein.   Also, if your service sucks or you need something, flip your egg girl.  And be prepared to stand in a line on the weekends."}
{"text":"All I have to say.....BANANA BREAD!!!!!! WOW!!! Definitely a must have. My omelet was amazing, seasoned potatoes were cooked to perfection. Very happy with egg works."}
{"text":"Decided to have breakfast last Sunday around 11:30 am . It was very busy so I was surprised our wait was less than 5 minutes. The greeters were courteous and friendly . Shortly after , we were seated and greeted by our waitress named Chantel . She was very knowledgeable of their large menu . She even recommended some combinations that were not on the menu . I decided to try one of her suggestions and it was to die for . I'm usually reluctant to order other than the same thing so this was a big deal for me to change my usual order of bacon and eggs . Thank you Chantel for opening my taste buds to a whole new world ."}
{"text":"This has become our weekend brunch eatery because of the quality of food and the extremely friendly staff. We've had Marianne a few times now and she is spot on as a server!! She is very friendly and always makes us feel welcome."}
{"text":"This is how breakfast is supposed to be. Came here after a crazy night out and couldn't of chosen a better place. Ashley was our awesome waitress and she guided us through the newspaper of a menu. Started with the best banana muffin EVER, then stuffed my face with French Toast and their house potatoes (half order was still huge). Downed it with some hot coffee ( it was pretty classy that they have flavored creamers). Overall, Great Menu, Great Food, Friendly Staff.. This is my new go-to breakfast spot..."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place after picking up my friend at the airport. We needed breakfast, and it had \"Eggs\" in the name, so I figured it was worth a shot. That was almost four years ago, and now I must eat here every time I come to Vegas (at least twice a year).  The food ranges from pretty good to excellent. They really excel with Mexican dishes. Their enchilada sauce is fantastic. There is a huge selection so I have plenty of veggie options. The carnivores that I've brought here love it too.  Service is friendly, and they get the food out so dang fast. Just what you want in a breakfast joint.  As others have mentioned, the big bonuses of Egg Works are as follows: redonk banana muffins, coffee carafe on the table, and free wi-fi."}
{"text":"I love Egg Works. One of my favorite places for breakfast or lunch. Awesome place for Brunch too.  I've ordered breakfast many times. Eggs are always cooked to perfection, and seasoned perfectly. Potatoes are also delicious. Last 2 times I've gone, I've had the Gumbolaya! Please never take this off your menu!  The Service is ALWAYS 5 Stars! With my busy schedule, I wish I had more chances to eat there. I take all my friends and family that visit, to Egg Works. It's one of my top 5 suggestions to visitors of Vegas.  I have nothing negative to say about this establishment. If you're here on Vacation, it's definitely worth the Uber/Lyft Ride there. It's conveniently located 15 minutes off the strip."}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing. Where do I start? The portions are giant. So if you know you will need to take somthing to go, here is a hint: eat all of the seasoned potatoes first. The do no heat up well at all.  The biscuits and gravy are delicious. The banana bread french toast is the best I have ever had.  The staff is usually terrific and is so wonderful to my 8 year old daughter, who changes her mind 10 times before the order comes out--from the type of drink she wanted to the type of toast--they have always accomodated her. This is the best place to eat. The only warnings I have besides the potatoes are that they close at 3 pm and they are usually super busy so there is a wait."}
{"text":"I have to say the customer service here is impeccable!! Tina was absolutely wonderful, she was very prompt and made sure we had everything we needed without even asking brought over napkins. The food was that much more amazing because of the customer service and staff being so attentive!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing portions...reminiscent of Good Ol' Days Vegas' breakfast....but the parking and wait are MUCH more desirable! HUGE selection from sweet (great pancakes) to heat (try their breakfast burritos!) Their Diablo potatoes are some of the best I've had!! Staff always seem exhausted, but it is a busy place! Fun ambience for kiddos...they have a train that circles from the ceiling tracks...when it's running. A funky and different place to try if you have the chance to leave the strip!"}
{"text":"Service was great.  They leave a carafe of coffee at your table which is awesome.  No need to be waving down a server everytime your cup goes dry.  They also have a cute menu which is like a newspaper.  Good was excellent!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Yes, another fine breakfast joint that is very reasonable, friendly service, and great food.  Came here today after an all-night bender on the Strip.  Their special was the \"Heart Stopper\" Skillet, with choice of egg, toast, and sausages and potatoes topped with country gravy.  Even on a Monday, the place is packed with locals.  This is a great place if you want to get away from the high prices on the Las Vegas Strip for breakfast.  Another treat that you will enjoy is the Banana Nut Muffin.  It was well worth the trip to the West Side.  I will be returning to this fine breakfast eatery."}
{"text":"I've been several times. The foods good, portions are big and the service is usually pretty good. You will get the occasional bad service if they are super busy. I won't come here on the weekends because it's too busy and the food isn't good enough to warrant waiting that long."}
{"text":"Sheesh! I'm kicking myself for not trying this place sooner. I came across Egg Works on Groupon looking for a good place nearby for bruch.  Right off the bat I knew it was going to be good by the long lines out the door (any foodie knows that's always a good sign). Walked in the hostess took down my name and despite the large volume of people in the restaurant she told me the wait was only 10-15 minutes. Not bad. It gave me time to check out the menu so I didn't mind.   As soon as we sat down the kids got crayons & an activity sheet so they were occupied which made me happy (it's the little things that make such a difference). Our waitress was very helpful. She even took the time to explain the different types of eggs, recommended a few of her favorite dishes when we couldn't make up our minds. We ended up getting the bacon & onion skillet, corned beef hash skillet, and bacon waffles for the kids which they split (oops, I forgot to take a pic). The corned beef was great. I'd recommend that for sure. And I don't even like corned beef so that's saying something!! The kids waffles were just okay. Nothing special. Probably should've went with the French toast. The bacon & onion skillet was very tasty. I'll probably order that again. And those potatoes that come with just about every dish...WOW! They were so good. I was actually pleasantly surprised how much I liked them.  All in all, the prices are fair, staff is very friendly and the food is great. Definitely coming back. I'm going to take my parents when they are in town next month. I have a feeling they will love this place too.   Side note: The noise level in this restaurant is pretty loud which makes it great for families with little ones. If you're a parent you know what I mean"}
{"text":"The five stars are for the service. Skip the corned beef mush! The scramble with feta cheese, spinach and mushrooms hit the spot and the banana muffins were great"}
{"text":"Went to Egg Work for breakfast this morning, since I am local I had been this location (On Eastern) for so many times, in general my experience were positive. However today just one bad employee and make my experience upside down.  Everything was good until I when to paid my bill. As usual I used coupon and paid with my credit card and I knew Egg Work require the cashier to check ID for all credit card pays. The cashier (Alice or Alicia) once she saw my credit card she asked for my ID. Here came to the problem, I remove my ID and hold it to show her, instead reviewing my ID. She just so busies doing something else and I was holding my ID about a minute and I though by now she should had enough time to review my ID. Than I put my ID away, by than she raise her head and tell me she did not see my ID yet. (Giving me a facial sour attitudes), I was very offended by her attitudes. I told her I was holding my ID about a minute for you to review it, and she reply with her attitudes \" I am busy doing your coupon\". At this point I did not want to continue the conversation, I just sign my credit card bill and left. And I was so unhappy her attitude and I forgot to give tips to my wait staff. When I realize it I stop my car and walk back inside the restaurant to pay the tips to wait staff."}
{"text":"Service is excellent & they will do it \"your way\". I really think that the food & overall, this place is excellent.  Our server PK is great & friendly."}
{"text":"Customer service was terrible. Our waitress Veronica seemed annoyed and frustrated. We were rushed in ordering. We had to ask for utensils as she was leaving our table. This is the first that we encountered bad customer service. If you go there and you happen to get the waitress VERONICA...?request for another waitress to make your meal more enjoyable. Aloha! ... As always the food was excellent!! Shaka sign to the chef"}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast sandwich on a croissant and their seasoned potatoes, both delicious. I loved the Banana muffin they offer instead of toast. I also loved the service. Our server Nicole was so sweet and engaging even though it was a little busy. Overall we loved it and will come back!"}
{"text":"Robert our server was great ! Very friendly despite how busy the place was. The service was quick and he always came to check on us !"}
{"text":"Brigette was amazing! I usually go to the other Egg Works. It is nice to know that the quality of service is maintained at both locations . I work in the area and this is now going to be part of my regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service! The hostess Nicole was very friendly and made our breakfast very enjoyable from the time we walked through the door!"}
{"text":"I always take visiting family and friends here for breakfast. I've probably eaten here at least 10x within the past few years. Every friend and family I have taken here has always left feeling full and happy with the service.  The last time I was here I took a few friends who wanted to get away from the strip. They wanted a breakfast place that wasn't expensive and that wasn't your typical pancake place. Here are a few things to keep in mind:   1. Place is popular. If you think your eating at say 10am, get there at 9:30am to reserve your seat. For us they told us it was a 20 min wait but it was more like 15 min. If you have an impatient party do come in earlier.    2. There are coupons in local magazines.    3. Come in HUNGRY because the portions are generous.  The last thing I ordered was a mashed potato omelette. I think it is one of my favorite omelettes there now. My friends ordered omelettes with avocados and we were all surprise how generous the amount of avocado (not complaining here)."}
{"text":"Cute little place in Vegas. The best part about this place is the Local Hawaiian Menu they have with SPAM breakfast meals and Loco Mocos! OMG if you are from the islands or you're familiar with those breakfast eats than this is a great place to eat.  The service was great, the place was clean and well kept, the prices were good, and it's family friendly.  I went here with my family and they were so accomodating for the babies and little ones with us. They were very attentive but not in an annoying way, and they got all our food out quickly!  I would go here again for sure, there were so many things I wanted on the menu, but I just couldn't order all of them!"}
{"text":"This is my breakfast of choice I love their muffins to start off.  Than the service is always great had the sausage omelet & for dessert the stuffed French toast love that stuff.  Will came back soon ."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast restaurant!! Eden helped us with our free muffin for checking in with Yelp. Great food! Ordered the Breakfast tostada, very yummy! Come hungry because the portions are big!"}
{"text":"Donna was a great server. Food is exceptional.  Awesome variety.  I had the Country Benny, eggs Benedict country style.  Biscuits instead of English muffin, sausage patty instead of Canadian bacon and sausage gravy instead of Hollandaise.  It was excellent!!!  My wife had an omelet loaded with meat and cheese and guacamole.  I had a bite and let me tell you.  It was awesome.  We search out Egg Works every time we go to Vegas.  You should too."}
{"text":"I love the potatoes here. Small, square, and covered in a seasoned salt. No onions it peppers. The perfect breakfast potatoe!   With that said, I love coming to this location because of the Train they have running throughout the whole establishment up by the ceiling. My toddler loves it and keeps him entertained whenever it enters the room.  As far as food go, their Banana Muffin is amazing. Served Warm. And melts in your mouth. I typically order the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet- breakfast potatoes smothered in Country Gravy, with a large cut up portion of the streak (no need to use a knife as they cut it up for you!) And topped with your choice of egg (I only eat scramble). It's simple but so damn good!   The kids meals come with choice of potatoe or fresh fruit, which I love because potatoes are hit and miss with my toddler (and a side of fruit is $6!).   I don't come here as often as I would like due to distance and husband, but I do try to take the time to do mommy and son breakfast from time to time."}
{"text":"Egg Works is our Go-to breakfast and brunch place and where we always bring visiting family and friends to for a hearty meal. Today, after a long run, I wanted to eat a good hearty meal to satisfy my hunger, so naturally, we went to Egg Works. Our hostess Jamie was very friendly, attentive, bubbly, & enthusiastic. She kept checking on us and made sure we needed everything that we need to make our meal satisfying. I even claimed my free Banana nut muffin upon Yelp check-in. Even though busy, she came to our table asking for our apologies for not being able to assist us fast but the fact is, she still assisted us in a timely manner.  The food is immaculate as ever and the serving was big enough to share leaving each of us full. Everything that I've eaten from this establishment since my family and I began coming here are all good. No disappointments to date.  The only issue that I have is our receptionist, the person who welcomed us first and who sat us, Abby was not stellar. When we entered she said \"Hi\" while yawning! What the heck! She asked us if we wanted to sit on the counter and upon replying \"No\" she told us that it will be a while before we'll be sat, we said that's fine, then two seconds later, she says: \"Oh, I didn't see that table over there is open, you can be seated now.\" I wanted to tell her to have a strong mug of coffee first before resuming her duties but I decided not to. We also saw her seat other patrons and she kept yawning! If I owned this establishment, I would not want any of my staff, especially the ones who greet the patrons first to be yawning every chance they get. Geeze!  A part from our issue with Abby, our time here today is great!"}
{"text":"First time at this location but my family and I are regulars at Egg Works next to the airport location. I happen to have seen this location during one of my Orthodontic appointments and I had made a mental note to try this location out.  As always, the service was fast. We were sat right away and our hostess, Laura took our orders immediately. She was very pleasant and cordial. She had a ready sweet smile for us and she was very motherly.  The food was superb and very satisfying. The patrons were mostly of  big families and there were less Milenials. Despite this, the energy of this location was vibrating with excitement.  This location is recommended to all.   Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Egg Works is an awesome place. We had the best waiter today Curtis. He was on top of everything. Ask for him when you visit."}
{"text":"Horrible! Terrible service, rushed and if you sit at the counter they monitor and censor , Yes Censor your private conversation!!!  Food is large portions, under cooked and sloppy!  Stay Away , this place has been going down hill for a while!"}
{"text":"As simply put, mediocre at best. There was so much hype about this place and even had to wait 15 minutes. Why wait 15 minutes when you can get virtually the same thing if not better at other breakfast places? On top of that, my waitress was very slow to serve us.   My friend, girlfriend, and I had already chosen what we desired yet, we waited an additional 10-15 minutes. It was busy but there's no excuse for waiting that long. I got the corned beef hash which was not that well cooked and the hash was shredded way too excessively. It was almost as if I'm tasting carnitas. On top of that was scrambled eggs, which there is nothing bad you can say about standard scrambled eggs. The potatoes were actually quite good. They had some kind of salt and spice that was addicting. But there's a problem when the side tastes better than the main dish.   Overall, mediocre food, below average service. Would not consider this an option for breakfast brunch. I would rather starve and wait for lunch if I had to."}
{"text":"Today we had a wonderful breakfast at Eggworks. Our waitress Laura did a great job in making us feel welcomed. The food and service was 5 stars. Excellent value for your $."}
{"text":"I'm just writing this so Victoria can go to Disneyland!!! She was super awesome as is the rest of the staff. I wish I was this happy in the morning. My boyfriend and I are local and this is our favorite breakfast/lunch spot. There's usually a wait so we like to just sit at the counter. Everything on the menu is great, but my favorite is the tuna melt. Probably the best one I've ever had!"}
{"text":"We came in for a late breakfast. I had a half  order of the works omelette with a side of fruit. . my buddy had full order of the stuffed french toast. Each with way too much food for a normal person. The omelette came with a banana muffins. It was very moist, boy was it good. The French toast was so large that if my friends have not eaten for a week he still wouldn't have been able to finish it. And it was delicious. There were two pieces of French toast with a scrambled egg in the middle. My omelette was just the right amount of food. It has a mixture of veggies and chicken with that melted cheese on top. Again absolutely delicious. I recommend coming in hungry and splitting the meal with someone else because otherwise it's way too much food. And the service couldn't be beat. The servers share a table so whenever you need something, you flip a little token on the table and a server comes over immediately and takes care of you need."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite place in the world for breakfast! I've tried so many amazing items I don't know where to start reviewing so I'll just start with my all time favorite, the 5 way Cinci chili. Spaghetti,chilli,beans,an insane amount of cheese,and onions. This is not something everyone ordinarily orders but really should try!   And as other have mentioned, those banana muffins!Yummmmmm"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Maryanne was the best!"}
{"text":"The service here at Egg Works was amazing! Robin was on it and was at our table before we sat! My kids always eat the eggs here but not mine at home! Robin really helped make our experience here very welcoming and warm! Its a nice home away from home for breakfast. We usually eat at home but the service and food here is so good we are starting to want to come here more and more!"}
{"text":"Took a friend here this morning who loved the food. Great early hours starting 6am and top service. Comparable to the Omelet House for the vast menu options. They both serve highly seasoned and heavily salted potatoes which I cannot stand. Easy enough to avoid unless ordering a skillet breakfast which includes spuds in the actual dish. Will not order again but will return for other options soon."}
{"text":"We had a group of 8 for brunch on a weekday.  2 members of our group are gluten-free, and we were shocked to find they had no gluten-free menu - not even a designation on the main menu or any guidance to be had. One ordered a \"wrap\" and asked for it on a corn tortilla rather than flour. The waiter said, \"Really?\" And made a strange face. It was uncomfortable and embarrassing for the poor child who has a food intolerance. The other gluten free person ordered a Works Tostada. Tostadas are served on corn tortillas but this came out in a flour tortilla bowl - which is not what the menu said.  But that wasn't before a Breakfast Tostada was served instead.  The waiter said he wasn't even aware of the Works Tostada on the menu and admitted he entered the order wrong.  Needless to say none of us will be returning. Very disappointing and unsure where the great reputation comes from. All food was mediocre at best, and service was clearly below average!"}
{"text":"checked this place out and was so happy with the results! Candice was the bomb and was super nice! we wanted a couple of things different from what the menu said and  she accommodated perfectly!   I am a vegetarian and she happily substituted in something else for the meat selection!!  would definitely recommend and come back again!"}
{"text":"Open only for breakfast and lunch. We went for breakfast. One meal was oatmeal which was excellent. Another was the Sundance omelette which was cooked to order and contained fresh ingredients. The third was simple scrambled eggs and bacon.  We all had the fresh banana muffins served warm and excellent coffee. The quality of everything was excellent. The prices were fair for what you were served. The quantity was more than substantial and the service was prompt and friendly. Ambiance was quaint rural with a large scale train running quietly on tracks (along the ceiling edge) through the \"countryside\". A definite \"should try.\""}
{"text":"Awesome food, huge portions. Our server Amy L. was fast and friendly. Love this place"}
{"text":"Heck no techno. Not only is it beyond busy (can't really imagine why), the staff was not helpful, orders were wrong, and the food was forgettable.   This was such a let down. I was running late to a group breakfast with my parents and another couple, I told my mom to order for me. Without looking at a menu, I just said to get a Reuben.  When I got there, my food was waiting for me, and everyone was eating besides my mom. I guess that the waitress had gotten the order wrong, and my mom was waiting for a new plate. My mom said that I would be arriving later, and my plate arrived early.  As I tried to eat my (cold) sandwich, I asked for some thousand island and water.  While we were eating, a different waitress comes and says, \"I was told to bring you a muffin.\"   Not, hello, I have a muffin for you. Or, did someone need a muffin?  She sounded unhappy to be handing out delicious muffins. How can you be grumpy when you are handing out bomb muffins?  Overall, overpriced, bland, mushy food. The fries were good though. This is also the 2nd time that orders have been wrong for my parents. Not cool.  Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. My mom ordered an omelet, and I ordered a Loco Motion. Hamburger patty with sticky rice, 2 eggs and brown gravy. I ordered my eggs poached, and my patty medium rare.  The food came out quite quickly, and our waitress was kind.  My mom liked her omelet, and I thought that my patty was a little over cooked, but it was still good. However, it almost tasted like they cooked it in A-1 steak sauce, and it was kind of clashing with the gravy. My eggs were cooked nicely. It came with pineapple, but I was disappointed with that. It was not ripe, and more white than yellow. I chose a banana muffin instead of toast.  My daughter and I ate it, but it left my fingers greasy.... Not something a muffin should do.  The women's bathroom was gross.  There was only one clean stall.  The first stall closest to the sink couldn't be opened. The middle stall was clean,  the third, and final (only handicapped stall) had fecal matter in the bowl,  and paper on the floor.  I looked on the rest room sheet, and no one had been in there or signed off on their cleaning duties since 8/4 (yesterday). Kind of a mood kill."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat the seasoned potatoes were amazing! And the banana muffin was so good! I think price wise it was very inexpensive but then again I live in Hawaii so most places are cheap compared to Hawaii!  The loco moco wasn't the best but everything else was great!! I recommend this place for sure! Also we did have a new waiter who just started but he was great! And honest so no complaints...."}
{"text":"Celebrating a birthday in Vegas and gave Egg & I a try. Best breakfast place we've ever been too. This place was busy with a 30 minute wait and the hostess and our server were very friendly and helpful with helping us make choices. We will definitely visit this place when we're in Las Vegas again. Banana nut muffin is a must!"}
{"text":"You can't judge anyone by the way you look...Food was excellent! But my server gave me blah service while he was kissing ass to the older ladies by me. Tipping is very important and I base tips by the service. I am very generous because I work for tips as well. With this service, he did not deserve anything. NO TIP FOR YOU!!!   }:("}
{"text":"Our waitress, Blade, was not only friendly, and kind,  but a beautiful human being and very attentive.  You gotta know anyone with the name BLADE, KICK's ASS! Great establishment!"}
{"text":"We came to Vegas for the week. And on our last day, on our way out. We decided to stop by at this place. And I regret not coming here sooner. I would have been having breakfast here everyday if I had known it would have been this awesome. It was busy to begin with, with a 15 minute wait time and me being impatient. I figured it must be good to be waiting so long, either that or I'll end up hangry. My family and I tried the breakfast burritos which are huge and tasty! The chilli wasn't our favorite but dear lord, please try their burgers. The breakfast styled burger was epic. Packed a lot of flavor and so many fresh ingredients. If you can, also try their banana nut muffins! They are worth the trip! The customer service was top notch. Our server Perry, was phenomenal. Took good care of us and was very informative. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot.  The portions are big and greasy.  Lots of protein options for me since I am not a pig eater.  Usually hard to find at breakfast places.  Service is always a little slow.  I love that they have a patio. It may just look at the parking lot, but I don't care I love to be outside."}
{"text":"Our last experience here was not good. Cold food, waitress was unattentive. manager was  nice and  apologetic and addressed our issue. Will review again after our next trip."}
{"text":"Just had brunch with a big group in ifrom Cincy. Jennifer was awesome! Food was great. Service was super!! Wish we had one in Cincinnati!"}
{"text":"The food here is good. The tall, tattooed busser who was working today is nice as well. We left a tip on the table for him but the server ended up grabbing it I saw when we were leaving."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service from Lisa T., wonderful!!!  Found this place by accident,  got lost, glad we did!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Our server, Matthew, was attentive and fast. The banana nut French toast with hot and delicious. We enjoy that. The Apple marmalade that came with it is also very good. We also got a bandito scramble and it was delicious! We will definitely come back the next time we are in the Las Vegas area. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in town. The country fried steak and corned beef hash dont ever dissapoint. The muffins are pretty amazing as well. Our waiter Taylor was great!"}
{"text":"This was my second time to this location and I left feeling full and happy. The staff is definitely the best part. The food is good, but they really do a good job of making me feel welcome. Donna was my server and Eden was training with her. Both of them were great.   I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Portion sizes are humongous and service was excellent! Heather was an excellent waitress, make sure you request her when you come down!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Huge portions. Deliciousness with everything I've had there. I find it a bit too pricey for my wallet for breakfast, but when I do want to splurge a bit this is where I go!"}
{"text":"Their loco moco is legit. But if you're in the mood for tender pork then go with the Carnitas Rancheros. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"PK was our server. All I can say is he was the best.  Very personable, attentive and friendly.  The food was great (got have the banana muffin) the service super.  Thanks so much PK.  Aloha!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The hostess are always smiling and so welcoming as soon as I walk into the door. The hostess Nicole is the sweetest thing! My favorite place to eat :)"}
{"text":"The food is great!! Very fresh and flavorful. Definitely a must GO to when you visit Vegas. Our waiter Matthew was very attentive and professional.     I will absolutely come back again."}
{"text":"Yummy food with big portions, not to mention. AMAZING service by our server, Diane, who was very attentive, sweet, and upbeat!!! She made our experience awesome and even gave us a banana muffin just because it was our first time  LOVED IT!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here the other day and the food and service was great. Will keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"My wife and I just ate breakfast here. The food, service, and environment was fantastic. Our waiter (Manny) was very efficient and very polite. He made our visit very pleasant. Thank you and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with this place. Nice atmosphere, good prices and very friendly! I had the corned beef hash, it was homemade and you really could tell. It was really good. This will now be my goto breakfast place!"}
{"text":"First time here and pretty impressive! Great and fast accurate service from Brigette.  We will come back again to try their Loco moco, skillets, crepes, and other bfast items. This place is always packed but they have a fast service so the wait time is bearable. Very casual place which is good for families."}
{"text":"We walk in on Black Friday dining area not too bad. Wait wasnt terrible. We sat down ordered our drinks. I ordered as always an Arnold Palmer. The tea must be freshly made because the ice in the drink was melted and i couldn't taste a hint of lemonade. I order a cold drink and would expect it  to be somewhat chilled. So I  did the next best thing and ordered another cup.....filled with ice.   My plate came first then the wife's a couple minutes afterwards. I ordered the chicken enchilada omelette which was good. The Hablo Diablo potatoes on the other hand were very salty, must be the seasoning they use.   Overall we enjoyed. By the way did i mention a feee muffin when you check in with Yelp for the first time?"}
{"text":"The food was good! Corned beef was a tad salty, but the Santa fe burrito was awesome. The service was egg-cellent. If you can be seated in Louann's section do it! She was great and tipped us off on the groupon deal. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We've only been here once, on our most recent visit to Vegas. As a Vegas runaway some 8 years ago, I had no idea this place was here. I don't usually review a place after only one visit but in this case I'll make the exception because we probably won't be back for a year. When we do come back, I'll suggest this place to the peeps because it really was that good. Loved the menu and walked away with an Egg Works coffee mug.  My only criticism comes in because they have buckwheat pancakes on the menu, which I love. However, when I asked if they were gluten free (I'm a glutard) the server had to go away to find out. On return she said no, they have wheat. WTF?! In this day and age with so many glutards out there, you have to be somewhat accommodating. I know there are many other gluten-free options on the menu, but there were no pancakes and I had a hankerin' for pancakes. This is the only reason they lost a star.  My veggie omelet was excellent and really enjoyed the potatoes. My mate had a very traditional type breakfast with eggs over easy and sourdough toast. We both very much enjoyed our breakfast.  In the end, I can only say that we loved the place and will be back next time around. The only thing I would suggest is a little more attention to detail and to try to do something for those with common food restrictions. Other than that, excellent."}
{"text":"Great breakfast option in SW Vegas. Breakfast is standard but good. Burgers are above average. Service often leaves something to be desired unfortunately.   They respond quickly to the sad egg on the table though if you have problems."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is bright and cheery, the waitstaff are friendly, helpful and on the ball. If you need something, just flip the adorable egg on the table. We were playing with & a staff member was standing there before we even finished flipping it over, lol.  Be sure to have a banana nut muffin, they're yummy.  Make sure you bring your appetite, the portions are Very Hearty, no chance of leaving hungry from this establishment.   I tried the Fiesta Skillet (with chorizo) and my other half has the chicken fried steak and I can only assume that it was delicious by the fact that not only did he eat every last bite, he was so busy digging in he barely had time for conversation (very unlike him!). We'll definitely save this one in the GPS."}
{"text":"Really nice location, the staff are polite. The table for 2 is a bit crowded with all of the side items (the eggy tray of goodies) and once a plate and a pot of coffee is added, it feels downright tiny.    The kitchen was a little backed up today and our waitress seemed really concerned about it, worried about the patrons, but although there was a wait- the food was worth it!   We enjoyed the stack of Hawaiian French toast and a giant 4 egg & sausage wrap."}
{"text":"Holy skillets!!!!! Their skillets are huge and hard for humans to finish. That being said, I come close to finishing every time! I was so hungry I couldn't even take a picture of my meal.... Should've see the aftermath though!   Must have the banana nut bread!!!!"}
{"text":"So if u like breakfast.... Or if u don't.... U can find something here. :). The menu is huge!!  I think the first time I came.... I sat there for over 10-15 minutes trying to figure it what to get.... Lol  The menu covers everything from pancakes to crepes to French toast to omelets to sandwiches to wraps to pizzas to etc.... Yeah in other words lots and lots of choices!   Ambiance is a no frills kinda place. Totally laid back with condiments already at the table so that you don't really need to ask for anything once u make up your mind. Use the egg on the table. Black with a smiley face if u are happy to yellow with a frowny face if u need something. (4/5) just a warning in the morning there are alot of families there so if screaming crying kids bother you... U might want to come a tad bit later in the day. :D  I've been here I don't know how many times.... But the service that I have received has been very very good. Is it perfect? No.... But for the style of restaurant that this is... Pretty good. (4/5)  I've had omelets.... I have had salads.... I have had sandwiches.... I've had the pizzas.... And etc.... They have all been consistently good! Nothing stands out as a signature dish for me nor does anything stand out as down right disgusting. Overall I have been very pleased with everything that I've ordered. (4/5)  Will I be back... Of course.... Will I recommend... Of course. :)  Tip #1 - if u are a Tabasco fan like me.... Ask... They have it but only if u ask. :)  Tip #2 - if u are in a hurry and don't wanna wait.... U can sit at the counter without a wait.... Well that is as long as there is room at the counter. :)"}
{"text":"Friendly and great food. The omelets were excellent and you can order most of them half size, which we loved. I can only recommend it!"}
{"text":"All I can say is if you don't get the banana nut muffin.... or 3 in my case then you didn't do egg works right. Seriously so good!! Good breakfast place with good prices."}
{"text":"I love breakfast...EggWorks 2 took a fairly good stab at it.  I ordered The Benny, which is your standard Eggs Benedict and a side of their potatoes. Now, I don't expect a life changing experience for $9.50 but honestly, anyone could duplicate this for the same money or less.  The only serious chink in their armor was the coffee-bitter with a bleach after taste :o( BananaNut muffins were \"not ready\" didn't help!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint!  I eat here a couple times a month.  Their eggs benedict is yummy and my daughter loves loves loves their breakfast potatoes. Fast and friendly service and great food.  Their banana nut bread is YUMMY!  My husband loves it because he can get a beer for breakfast :)"}
{"text":"We travel to Vegas for a couple of months each year and we eat here at least 3 times a week, not only is the food very good and plenty , the help has always been very good, especially Laura she has been there the last 3 years and still remember us, their manger, Kris, is first class, always helping not only his workers but very pleasant to the customers. The place is always clean and tables cleaned up very quickly. Bill Nancy from Medford Oregon"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch during the week bc it's fast delicious & close to my office. Marc is an awesome server. Very friendly & provides great service. One of my go to spots for a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"Meal portions are huge here! Don't be fooled into thinking you will still be hungry after ordering here. My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast for the first time and our waitress Tanya was amazing. She was so helpful and kind. She even got us their famous banana nut muffins in honor of our first time. Must try!"}
{"text":"We has breakfast here today and I was blown away by Bradley's service. He was really attentive, and the food was great."}
{"text":"Tried this place out based on the reviews. Was solid but not anything that blew us away. Potatoes were of the frozen variety, service was ok took a while to get service but food came out quick. Overall the wait time was about 40 minutes on a Saturday."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The banana nut muffin is my fave :) Marc is usually my server when I come in and he is amazing!! Always is so sweet and makes me feel welcomed. I would recommend this place to anyone. It is one of my fav breakfast spots."}
{"text":"I've been coming here consistently for 1.5 years and all I can say is AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE & FOOD ! Your selection is small in Vegas when it comes to a GOOD breakfast with service to match and this is the spot ! Try the Santa Cruz burrito  or the chicken ,mushroom,spinach skillet"}
{"text":"Love the skillets here. And their breakfast burritos are amazing too. We go here a few times a month and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Egg works-the mashed potato omelette and the enchilada omelette are both excellent! The restaurant also provides butterscotch Pancakes and butterscotch waffles. The service is always strong here as well. I recommend if you are looking for any breakfast dish."}
{"text":"Country Benny was off the charts. Blue Berry Pancake awesome only reason I didn't give 5 stars is potatoes were below average. Shantel was my server. She's a ROCKSTAR and I would come back just to have her serve me. What a great employee she did you guys proud!  Work on those potatoes and you'll get a 5."}
{"text":"Nothing quite like strolling into a local breakfast place, plopping your butt on a stool a the bar, getting a cup of coffee that never gets past half empty, having fun people to talk to and solid food.   All of that, Egg Works.  I've been to Hash House (pretty much live there when I stay downtown) a lot, and while I do love that place, this local little breakfast nook has supplanted HH.  So, as I said, I hop on a bar stool, the manager Gia stops over to throw down on some coffee and ask if I have any questions. Nope. Menu is straight forward, well laid out and my prey is ripe for the picking: The Sundance Special Omelet. What's that you ask? Spinach, sliced mushrooms, artichoke hearts folded with Swiss cheese and a special Works artichoke cheese filling and then topped with feta cheese and fresh tomatoes. Right from the menu. But, am I satisfied with all that? Nope, throw in the chicken!!! Opted for the American fries and some sourdough as well.  The omelet... amazing. Perfectly done, ingredients all complimented each other and the chicken was seasoned perfectly with a bit of a spicy, southwest style seasoning. The kicker though, the special sauce, having some sort of lime flavor to it, which literally had me doing back flips off the stool. I swear I went into the hunch over the plate to ensure my neighbors didn't even look at it. Sourdough toast was toasted perfectly, not cold and was a perfect vessel to help wreck the omelet.   American fries (while I normally opt for hashbrowns, figure, it's a house special, go with it) were incredible. Each spud was crisp on the outside, fluffy inside and hit up with that same southwest kind of seasoning the chicken had.   Can't wait to head back and try more menu options. Actually, must head back and try more menu options."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place period.  I admit the costs are a little bit high but not too bad.  I always go for the meat skillets.  The Egg Works potatoes are by far the best thing about this place.  They are little spicy and cooked perfectly.  I have always had good service here even when they are pretty busy.  The atmosphere is nice too.  Despite it being right by a busy airport, it sort of reminds of an old school country breakfast place."}
{"text":"This is the same as the Egg & I. May even be same owners. Lists both on the menu for the LV locations. I have been to the Egg & I in Utah and it was very similar.  First the staff was great. Very attentive, friendly and quick. Never an empty glass and always brought things before I realized I needed it.  The location was great! Very clean lot and restaurant. In and out. No sloppily looking anything here!  We went on a Tuesday so there was no wait. I have seen a lengthy wait for this place though. Probably because it is so good.  Now the food. Everybody was very happy with the food. We had a party of four and most people left stuffed. The waffles were the perfect golden brown color and had soooo many berries on it. I wished I had ordered it.   The French toast was prepared with thicker than normal bread and had the scent of cinnamon lingering in my sinus long after we left. It looked like it was done to perfection. Just the right amount of crisp while still maintaining a nice \"softness\" to it. I wished I had ordered it.  The Bacon, eggs and has browns filled the entire plate. one just as equal as the other. The eggs cooked and the yokes not broken? My favorite!. The bacon was nice and crispy but not burnt. The potatoes had an awesome scent of rosemary wafting toward me. The cheese on top seemed to make the dish. The sourdough toast had me rethinking my choice. Yes, I wished I had ordered it!  The Fiesta Skillet was prepared to perfection! The melted cheese, the egg on top, the potatoes within all perfect. The skillet also had a great amount of green chilies in it. It was not too spicy. The flavors mixed together in a flavor explosion in my mouth. It also came with wheat toast and that was just as good and a tremendous help in getting all the incredible food out of the skillet. I wished I had ordered TWO!  Okay, Okay one was plenty. I actually ordered a half skillet which is not listed on the menu. Very filling and half the calories. I always seem to gain 6-8lbs when I go to Vegas and with the help of the half skillet I got away with 1lb after a 5 day trip. Booya!  I definitely recommend this location and establishment for all! They even have a bar type seating area with news shows and ESPN on so you can catch up on events while enjoying one of the best breakfasts in Vegas. I had five places I wanted to try for breakfast bookmarked but after eating at the first, it will be hard to not just go back here! The other 4 have a lot to live up to!!!  Most certainly will return here many times."}
{"text":"Monday morning and with my Grammy hangover I took myself to Egg Works for some re-fueling. Luckily we were sat with Ashley who corrected my ghastley.I ordered the 3 pigs, ham, bacon, sausage omlet, and my trip to recovery began. Several cups of coffee with ma toast and I was all good. Anytime I have friends in from out of town I always bring them here, it's just that kind of place. Promise not to be such a mess next time I come in."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast and brunch place.  We had our family reunion in Vegas, so there were 31 of us.  They didn't take reservations on Sunday, but they were very accommodating for 8:00 am and a party of 31.  The service was awesome, our server, she was so personable and on top of things, a real PRO!  Their egg dishes are humongous, 4 eggs!!  And a lot of delicious sides.  The chocolate chip pancakes were a hit as was the waffles and all. Of their egg dishes, their scrambles and egg combos are delish. Sis had the egg crepes, too yummy and big. Such a diverse and large menu, you will be sure to find something!  The seasoned potatoes were awesome.  Great restaurant, great service and awesome wait staff!"}
{"text":"Granted I just got off a 6 hour flight from Hawaii, but I wasn't so jet-lagged that I could not help noticing the hostess on 11/01/14, circa 0930 hours, so OBVIOUSLY DISCRIMINATING against us.   Upon being led to a 2-seater table in the middle of the walkway in the restaurant, I politely asked if we could sit in a 4-seater on the side of the room. The restaurant was not filled. The young brunette hostess told us that she is \"NOT ALLOWED TO SEAT 2 PEOPLE IN 4-SEATERS ON A SATURDAY MORNING.\" Being that I was with my 78 year old non-confrontational Asian Mother, I did not persist in asking for another table. Our server was very sweet, as all the servers have been in my past 4-5 visits to Egg Works.   As we filled our stomachs with hot coffee, I became more and more lucid and then noticed that the 4-seater tables to the left of us and behind us had two people at each of them. I then observed Miss Hostess bringing another couple to a 4-seater across from me. The restaurant NEVER filled up while we were there.   Yeah, the banana muffin is pretty delicious after a long plane ride, but I'll think twice about going to this Egg Works next time I'm in town and go some place else--hopefully, where I'm treated like everyone else."}
{"text":"I really truly did want to try Egg Works after having it bookmarked for so long. The parking lot had plenty of parking. We arrived mid-morning so we avoided the morning rush and were seated promptly. Looking around everyone was taking food to go so we opted to share an omelette and get an extra muffin with the Yelp check-in. I asked the waiter if this would be okay and she said yes. We ordered the works omelette as it seemed to have a little bit of everything.  Our muffins arrived and neither of us was impressed with it. Sure it was warm and the butter melted on it but the flavor I was expecting just wasn't there. Our omelette arrived and the portion was really huge. I was disappointed as everything was so chopped and mushed that you couldn't distinguish any of the contents and this we both found disgusting. The even more disgusting part is yet to come. When our bill arrived, we noticed we were charged for the muffin in addition our omelette. No big deal, or so I thought. Thought they'd take care of it when we checked out at the cash register but boy, I didn't think it would take a whole lot of time.  The cashier started to pull up our check and I let her know about the Yelp check-in. She proceeded to insist that because we ordered an \"extra\" muffin that's why we were charged. After explaining it she proceeded to ask the hostess if the Yelp check-in was still valid. If anyone should know these things, you'd think it would be the cashier who rings people up all day. Now there was a line of at least 3 people waiting to pay their checks and I could certainly feel their eye rolls over waiting during this whole ordeal. It wasn't the $2 muffin, but the sole principal that if you have something on your Yelp page, you should honor it. Lastly, they had to have the manager come over and remove it from our bill.   I'm not quite sure I understand the hype of this place. Come if you have an abundance of time to kill, but don't expect the food to be anything special. There are plenty of other places in the area that we've been to that rank way higher than Egg Works. Sorry, but unfortunately we won't be coming back here.  2016 Review #57"}
{"text":"Awesome ! I love the food here especially the potatoes! The seasoning is amazing! I got the Santa Cruz burrito and it was awesome as well! Also the service couldn't have been better! When we arrived we were seated immediately and we had an amazing server Emily who just was awesome! Constantly bringing refills making sure we were okay! Also to top it off our food came out in like 5 min. Probably the fastest I've ever gotten my food at a restaurant! Thanks so much for the wonderful food will surely be back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Crispy breakfast potatoes, healthy and not so healthy options cover everything you need for breakfast and lunch. Fresh fruit on the side is always more than generous. Definitely pulls an \"older\" crowd but that's fine with me I'm just there for the food! Homemade muffins are usually available free with yelp check in and totally worth it and delicious! They sell their own salsa which is good but I've never purchased and the inner kid in me absolutely loves the egg train that circles over and over around the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"I've wanted to eat here for the longest time, and I finally made it out. I must say, I definitely wasn't disappointed! Our wonderful server, Donna, gave us a couple (delicious!) complimentary banana bread muffins after finding out we were first timers, which I thought was awesome. I had the Works skillet, and it was beyond amazing. The mix of all the delectable tastes together created a perfect dish! And my boyfriend very much enjoyed his waffles. I think we found our new breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to have breakfast off the strip. Love the service and food. They are so accommodating and very customer service oriented. Our server Jessica was simply amazing. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had a great Easter Morning brunch with family and friends!  Debra was a cheerful server and always there when needed."}
{"text":"For those like me that cant wait till breakfast this is your spot. If you partied to hard on the strip or just feel like a nice hearty american breakfast than look no further.  This place is away from all the noise and crowed strip. The menu has something for every one. Trust me when I say everyone. In my party we had 3 picky vegetarians and they were very pleased with their choices. I also noticed some \"Latin/Hispanic\" choices that I will defiantly check out next time.   Also note that during football season this is a Chicago Bears joint. Very fun atmosphere. The service was impeccable. Friendly and fast without sacrificing taste and presentation.   If you need a quick break from the strip and need to gather your strength and consciousness back before you go back and do more damage then this is your place."}
{"text":"Great service and food from the moment you walk in they take care of you .Theresa was our server and she was very helpful and attentive,Candice was our food runner and she was very kind and Sky and Noah made my checkout experience one to remember very helpful and also courteous."}
{"text":"Love the food and service! Try the breakfast Potatoe skins! They are not on the menu but if you order them and they have the potatoes they will make them for you!"}
{"text":"Good food fast. Blade, our server was pleasant and efficient. Food was good and served hot. We will return."}
{"text":"This place is delish! Original hardy breakfasts with lots of flavor.  Different options for different taste buds. If it weren't extremely noisy and can sometimes get really busy this place would be a regular spot for our family weekend breakfast place."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast/lunch spot with offerings me and my coworkers find ourselves craving on a regular basis. Service is consistently fast and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Las Vegas, the food is a reminder of a family owned restaurant rather than a corporate frozen food joint. The service was amazing Amy thank you for making my Friends birthday a good experience at Egg works! Tip: get the mimosas to get your day started just right."}
{"text":"EGG WORKS WAS A RAY OF SUNSHINE in an otherwise tough morning!  Wait time at peak business hours was less than quoted, service impeccable and food exceeded our expectations in quality and quantity.  Will look forward to coming back here!"}
{"text":"UPDATE.. Came back again to this location. On NOV 1... THIS TIME was so much better than my last visit/review. My waitress was prompt, answered all of my questions, made sure we had everything we needed. The food was ok.. Im not raving about it. But it came nice and hot. The presentation was good. But way too salty on the season potatoes. Need to ease up on the salt... Please I do not want my heart to crystallize . I do want to thank management that made contact with me on my previous visit. This is why I came back."}
{"text":"Everything was great! My Apple cinnamon pancakes were very tasty. My server(Veronica) was very professional, attentive and friendly. I will definitely return to this location."}
{"text":"These guys know what they're doing! When you come in for a visit remember to get the banana nut muffin, it tastes practically homemade! :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast dishes. Believe it or not you can have any dish without eggs and they will substitute fruit.  All the staff are efficient and friendly, but Candice really stands out."}
{"text":"Two words: Spinach Benny. A huge helping of eggs benedict with plenty of spinach on top. I had to take the second helping home because it was so much. Good potatoes too. Our waitress was super friendly and fast. From the looks of the menu, there's nothing bad you could possibly choose (breakfast or lunch) which is why it was full on a Sunday morning. Reasonable prices too for the amount of food you get. They have a nice patio which we didn't take advantage of since it was drizzling but I bet it would be perfect on a nice sunny Vegas day."}
{"text":"My husband are I were looking for a breakfast restaurant before we hit the road.Since we aren't from this area I was a bit concerned because I was really hungry and wanted something really good and inexpensive. Let me just say that this has got to be one of the best breakfast I've ever had! I had their original breakfast burrito with sour cream and avocado,delish! Their orange juice tasted so fresh! So glad we chose to eat here!we will definitely come again next time we're around here. Also, great customer service!oh and i almost forgot, the banana but bread! So good!!!"}
{"text":"Went to egg works this morning and the food was amazing our server Donna made our day my 1yr old daughter loved her"}
{"text":"Went to Vegas on March 11th. When I got off the plane, my sister and I was super hungry so we did a search for breakfast places near the airport and Egg Works came up. This place is AMAZING! When we arrived we were greeted by the hostess and was seated right away. The server came within 3 minutes and took our drink orders. My sister ordered their mimosa and I had regular coffee to start. After drinks the super nice server took our meal order and once it arrived OMG I fell in love with this place. I wish they had a Egg Work in Maryland!   Overall, our experience was positive here. We came back again on March 14th before we left Vegas to head back to Washington DC and the food was very consistent. Will definitely be back on my next trip to Vegas very soon."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and service was friendly and prompt. I was given a complimentary muffin!   Two things that brought my rate down from 5: At around noon on Easter, filled to about two thirds capacity, it was really loud. A lot of the sound was from fairly loud music. It made it hard for the server to hear my order correctly, he brought \"fries\" instead of \"fruit\". The noise also hindered our table talk. Yelp said \"average\" noise, but I thought it was louder than that.    Also, I ordered a chicken-salad sandwich that tasted fine but was a challenge to eat as a sandwich. It was a full 4 inches thick when served, and as soon as I picked it up almost all of the chicken salad fell out of the sandwich. I ate it with a fork, and was left with a lettuce and tomato sandwich.  Maybe the chicken chunks (nearly 1\" squares) need to be cut smaller to make it more of a spread.  Nevertheless, it's a good place to eat."}
{"text":"We weren't really that impressed with this place. We were looking forward to eating here because of the good reviews, but I found the food lacking in flavor and my potatoes were cold and hard. This was our second time with similar experiences. We won't be coming back here for a third."}
{"text":"My go to breakfast place... It makes you feel like you aren't in Vegas anymore. The ambiance is great, the staff is attentive and the menu is extensive. I love their bloody Mary's and they even sell the mix and hot sauces!!! The eggs Benedict is one of my favs!! Can't wait for the weekend and to make a visit to this place again!"}
{"text":"Our server, the food was incredible and our server KAT is the cutest of the litter! (All dad jokes aside) she was a class \"a\" server with a huge smile and more than enough stars in her eyes to get your Saturday moving right.  Thank you for such wonderful employees and great food to boot.  *psst, we think she'd love a vacation away **hint,  hint**"}
{"text":"Yep!  This place does it for me.  They are truly the place you want to go for breakfast.  The food is fresh, delicious and the staff is awesome.  If they ever have the loaded breakfast potatoes, you must eat them.  They were on special one time I went and have been craving them since.  Just like a loaded baked potato but made breakfast style.  Oh yah and the green salsa is also delish.  I pretty much recommend anything they make.  I have had a few things on the menu as well as a bite of what my girlfriend orders.  Eat here.  You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great breakfast stop after a long flight from Pennsylvania. In-flight snacks suck and we were starving! After picking up rental car and Yelping breakfast we were delighted to find Egg Works.  Service was friendly and fast. Decor was fun and bright. The food was delicious. I had the breakfast burrito and it was stuffed full, hot, and not too greasy. My wife's western omelet was also a huge portion and the potatoes were very tasty.  A great find that we will definitely visit again.  The banana nut muffin was highly recommended but we were stuffed."}
{"text":"I went in at 10:28 this morning to order food to go. The restaurant had EVERY table full and still had a line out the door! Victoria was my server at the counter, and while it took 20 minutes it was still pretty fast considering how busy the kitchen and the restaurant was.  Victoria was my waitress and she even expedited my payment because I was paying exact cash so that I wouldn't have to wait in the long line to pay for the to go. She was awesome and like your other locations this one rocks!  I hope Victoria gets the Disney trip"}
{"text":"The food was very good they had a lot of different choices the prices were fair the waitress was nice but it seemed like they were too busy my coffee cup was empty more than it was full it was not her fault though they were just under staffed"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast/lunch spots here in town. I love the omelets and there burgers are a big hit. Friendly staff and service is usually quick. They offer flavored creamers for the coffee (whoo whoo) and the banana nut muffins are awesome. Fyi, check Groupon for deals.. they occasionally have one for egg works.   This restaurant always puts a great start to my day.. and being that breakfast is the most important meal of them all.. I would recommend letting egg works hook you up! Lol"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this snazzy lil place. Very friendly staff & the food is good & hearty! I will definitely be back with the family."}
{"text":"I had the California egg-crepe with swiss cheese, bacon, guacamole, tomato, mushroom, and a side of hollandaise. It was amazing, to say the least! I was a little confused about an egg-crepe at first because I think of crepes as sweet and not usually egg-filled. But, to my delight, it was absolutely perfect! It reminded me more of an egg quesadilla, and it came with a heaping side of breakfast potatoes.  Of course I had a bloody mary, and I have to say this one made my top 5 list..... if anything because it is served in a mason jar!   I definitely recommend this breakfast spot, but be prepared to wait awhile.... it is popular for a reason!"}
{"text":"I went on a Friday for lunch, and the restaurant was humming but not crowded (I've heard the weekends are a super busy here). We had a great server and the food came out perfectly well and quickly. Being gluten intolerant, I just ordered some eggs and sausage, which were delicious, but looking at the AMAZING french toast and waffle plates my companions got, I did get jealous. It would be nice if they had more options for gluten free dining, but what they have is adequate, and service was very good."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with this place.  I don't think I've ever had anything bad here.  I love coming here with family on Sundays.  You never have to wait long even when they are crowded.  There is something to eat for everyone on the menu and food is always fresh.  We always get great service as well and prices are reasonable.  The manager always comes and checks on tables to make sure everyone is doing good.  I love my neighborhood egg works. Keep up the good work, guys!"}
{"text":"My family and I love the Eggworks! They always have a pleasant atmosphere and fresh food. If you aren't receiving the service you deserve, flip the egg at your table over and you will be helped right away (very clever).    The food is usually very consistent,  with the exception of the works potatoes (which are very delightful) but can vary depending on the chef.    Our waitress,  Laura C., was cheerful and spot on. Make sure to mention your waiter or waitress in your review so they can win a trip to Disney!"}
{"text":"So I went to Egg Works for the first time on May 6th and have been craving it ever since!  Since I was in the area of Egg Works 2 at 1:00pm, I decided to go for lunch!  Again, soooo good!!  I had the exact same thing I had before: Fresh Veggie Omelet, house potatoes and the banana nut muffin.  I swear, I could go again today.  I don't know what it is, but it is definitely good!!"}
{"text":"benny eggs... sauce was ok but it was missing the \"umph\"  potatos were yummy"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Huge portions and huge menu with lots of options.  I like it that they leave a coffee carafe on the table.  Our waitress, Candice, was great!  So attentive!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!!! Nice vibes. Great presentation the side of fruits was amazing. Wonderful waiters especially Robin"}
{"text":"Gabriel was very attentive and polite. Made our experience very pleasant.  The food was very good but the banana bread was the bomb."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Fresh squeezed orange juice. Vanessa was very friendly and excellent service."}
{"text":"Fair breakfast. Came here because of reviews. Unfortunately, restaurant is 'over' rated.  It was ok. Potatoes a bit salty."}
{"text":"Talk about a great first time experience.   Each person I came in contact with was very attentive and nice. The food was good too. My husband and I got the classic.   I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for some really delicious breakfast. Our waitress Kat was extremely nice and very helpful about the menu. Thank you Kat! Not to mention the fabulous corn beef hash breakfast I had. Very flavorful and a hefty portion."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this place!!!  I've lived down the street from this place for a year and never went, until May 6th.  My husband and I went here for our wedding anniversary breakfast (couldn't make it out to dinner together that night) and loved the entire thing!  I had: -Fresh Veggie Omelet, with the house potatoes & banana nut muffin.  You can chose either the banana nut muffin or toast- go with the muffin!  The portions are quite large, but you can order a half order- awesome!  They have a couple different kinds of coffee- Regular or Hazlenut and they have a get variety of creamers for you to use.  I am now craving this place like CRAZY.  So good and so fast!    During the week- it was no problem getting a table.  On the weekend- crazy line out front."}
{"text":"Typical American Diner. Not my cup of tea. Was edible not delicious. Service was so attentive it was almost oppressive. This is not the place to go for a quiet, relaxing breakfast. I had the veggie Benny and was disappointed, as usual. It still baffles me why Americans can't figure out hollandaise sauce. It's not that complicated people! Egg yolk, butter, lemon."}
{"text":"Kris and I have been here several times now, and we've got nothing but great things to say about this place. This Egg Works in Henderson consistently has great food and outstanding service. There hasn't been an egg-dish yet that we haven't enjoyed, and the country potatoes are also crisp, full, and savory! A special shoutout to our server Jodi and her speedy service; here's hoping you make it to Disneyland!"}
{"text":"Mario is the best server. Sweet, kind and very attentive. Love the food and adore Mario. Will certainly come often."}
{"text":"This place is always fantastic! We have gone at the busiest times (Sunday mornings) and even when they are slammed we are promptly seated. Everything I have ever tried has been delicious, the servers are friendly and attentive, and the menu has good variety. It's our favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Awesome buckwheat pancakes with blueberries and I had them add walnuts!  Very healthy and delicious!  Amanda was awesome server!"}
{"text":"Always great when we go and love the large selection! James was our server today and he went above and beyond with customer service!"}
{"text":"Very well run, large selection of breakfast, some with a Mexican flare. They also have their own hot sauces for sale.  Large selection of sides and all customizable breakfast items.  We came twice in two days, service was great, seating was fast on Friday and wait on Saturday morning was a quick 15 minutes.  Seating outside is also a dog patio.  Fruit side and main dish is awesome, my advice just order the fruit side as the entree includes coffee and toast for almost double the price.  Oatmeal was good.   Both times we were there the servers customized our selections of sides to creat a meal and saved us $.  Single disappointment was whether you wanted hash brown patties or country potatoes, they were frozen and processed.  Would have liked fresh but or grated but that's a personal preference.  We had one issue with a serving that was quickly addressed with many apologies from 2 different managers and staff.  Handled very well and we came back the next day with friends."}
{"text":"Totally love their breakfast menu and the ambiance is that of down home family get togethers."}
{"text":"I recommend trying the Chili Mac. It's the only place in the area that seems to have it. I get with their Works Chili."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot. Eggs Benedict, was on point. Sit in Ashley's section she knows her stuff and she makes a great Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Always good and consistent. Staff very friendly. Mimosas are the best ever !!!! The potatoes are amazing the eggs are always perfect and the kids love the pancakes"}
{"text":"This place it pretty awesome. It definitely gets crowded on the weekends, and especially Sunday mornings. But the wait is never too bad. Though, the little waiting space inside can become a serious traffic jam.  The service is friendly and attentive. You'll have a main server, but if you flip your tableside egg to yellow (how you let your server know you need attention), anyone at all will come over and get you what you need.  The menu is plentiful. Lots of delicious sounding items. And it's not just all eggs and breakfast. They have pancakes, lots of sandwiches, etc.  Besides juice an soda, they do offer a couple of cocktails (bloody mary, mimosa, red bull and vodka, and michelada). But the cost doesn't really justify what you get. I'm still not sure there was any vodka in my bloody mary.  If they ask if you want toast or a banana nut muffin, take the muffin! It doesn't look like much (this is not a place concerned with presentation or pretty plating), but it is positively delicious. The portions are huge, so come hungry or don't be afraid to share. It was so hard to choose what I wanted, but I finally decided to go with the chili omelette. So yum! The cincy chili here is quite fabulous and tasty. And the breakfast potatoes that most items come with are outstanding. Seasoned so well you don't dare want hot sauce or ketchup.  All in all, a good, cheap, hearty breakfast was had. We'll for sure be back."}
{"text":"Egg works is easily the best breakfast place in Las Vegas...maybe anywhere. They have one of the most versatile menus I have ever seen. Not only do they have breakfast, but also a good lunch menu. I have the \"Chili Skillet\" with \"Cincinnati Style\" chili. I am from Cincinnati. I can tell you, this is really authentic Cincy style chili. When combined with scrambled eggs and potatoes and cheese with awesome spices, this is one of the best dishes I've had. Also, the servers are really good and friendly. Great business plan, great service, awesome place to go."}
{"text":"What a great place!! Just a little drive off the strip, but well worth the entire 10 min drive...  Will go back again and again.. One of my new favorite spots!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place to come, the food is great and they give you allot of it. so come hungry. Every time we come we get great services and if your lucky enough to get Austin as your sever your day is much better for it and don't forget to check in you get a free muffin :)."}
{"text":"I had an order of loco moco with a side of strawberry yogurt and their classic potatoes. Their potatoes are the best potatoes I've had, I continue to get their potatoes each time I come regardless of what I get for my main meal. The seasoning on the potatoes are perfect and they're never over or under cooked. The environment of the restaurant is extremely welcoming, the servers are also polite. Their loco moco was very true to Hawaiian taste although I wish the gravy had more flavor. The meat was tender and my over easy eggs were cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I love this place! The potatoes are the best and I love their omelets. Great hometown atmosphere and the service is always great as well! Amy was our server today & she was great!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my skillet immensely.  As I was a new customer they threw in a free muffin.  The food was as good as the service.  I've never gone out for a better breakfast."}
{"text":"My family would not eat it at all is was so over cooked.  We had  burned toast  , black as it could be ,the  rest of the meal was not much to talk about . Just sad I use to love this place"}
{"text":"Ok so I have never been disappointed whenever I've come here. Breakfast and brunch is awesome! This location is close to where I live and it is always busy!   There are inside and outside seating for you to choose. TV to catch the game if you decide to grub on a Sunday and the environment is country casual.  Every item on the menu is pretty much home style comfort food but the warm banana nut muffins that most of the time you need to ask for is so freakin GOOD!  Anyhow if you haven't been here come. Foods great, people are friendly, sometime service can be a tiny bit slow but for the most part they are on it and super nice, so that makes up for it. I like it and my friends and family like it, and you will too!"}
{"text":"What's happened to this place? Higher prices, smaller portions, slower service, and now no fruit as a side garnish. It's also time they upped the ''$8'' limit on their Buy 1 Get 1 Free Coupon, there is very little on their menu for $8. Either that or get rid of the coupon. I had an awful experience with a hostess here, who argued with me over a coupon. Not a great experience. It seems management has changed, and with it a lot of their good service policies. I don't go here very much anymore."}
{"text":"This place was awesome with my pet with me on the patio area. Food was awesome. Being in the Airport Plane flight kinda sucked. Very loud. Bloody Mary not very good. But. The food was really good"}
{"text":"THANK YOU again fellow Yelpers! Hampton Inn powdered or whatever their eggs are just won't do.  Egg Works, well, works!  Super speedy seating, ordering and food service.  I placed a breakfast order with a few special requests, all of which were fulfilled perfectly.  Definitely going back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Generally have had good experiences at this location, but my last visit prompted this review.  I was greeted quickly and water and coffee soon followed.  I went with something I usually don't get which was the chicken, spinach, and shrooms skillet.  When the food arrived, after watching the dish die in the window while the two servers talked and slowly assembled a to go order, I noticed a surprising lack of spinach, chicken and mushrooms.  Dish was 20% eggs over med, 70% potatoes and 10% was a smattering of half raw mushrooms, spinach and chicken.  The chicken was just diced up lunchmeat chicken so yeah. For $11 a very disappointing dish.  Maybe I chose the wrong skillet but the lack of advertised ingredients was very disappointing."}
{"text":"After settling in, breakfast was on the agenda...YELP reviews made Egg Works a must go. We ordered the Egg Works deluxe. It was really good and the portions were definitely shareable sizes. The service was good.    Military Friendly: yes 10% discount"}
{"text":"We're from L.A and we were looking forward to Egg Works' French Toast Stuft Omelette and this place had no more French Toast whatsoever after we phoned 4 orders. We didn't get a call till about 25mins later about the situation. Am really disappointed in not getting what we truly wanted."}
{"text":"Very good place for breakfast. Portions are okay, nothing like Hash House, but the food and the service were really good. Definitely co sided this place if you are searching for a good breakfast spot."}
{"text":"They only recently opened up the Summerlin location. Great place for breakfast. There was really only i hop as a choice before. It is a welcome addition to Summerlin"}
{"text":"Ash H. was our server and she is awesome! Super friendly and quick service! We're visiting from Chicago and we're always trying to find the best breakfast spot in every city and Egg Works did not disappoint! They are super quick and a well organized team. The food is exactly what you want for breakfast food - the veggie benny is great for any vegetarians out there. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. I can never go wrong with a Santa Cruz skillet. Generous portions. I always leave with food for later! The service is the best. Shoutout to Nicole D. for being an amazing hostess! Super nice and courteous. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian burgers. Service was great. We were in and out in less than an hour it felt! (And it was pretty busy.) great place, good few options for vegetarians."}
{"text":"I love how you can order then pick up to go! A little pricey ($20 for two meals) but overall pretty good!"}
{"text":"We eat at egg works every weekend not only because they have delicious bfast but the service!!  Curtis knows I love to take 2 large ranch dressings home with me. He brought to our table without me even asking yesterday!! He remembers what my husband and I like to order and is a friendly, awesome server!! This is our favorite egg works and all the people are attentive and go out of their way to make your breakfast experience great!! Thanks Curtis!!"}
{"text":"Thank you ASHLEY for the exceptional service. Above all else, service means everything to me; once we find a standout server at a restaurant, we are loyal customers for life. Solely because of Ashley's remarkable service, lovely smile, kindhearted demeanor, and sunshining presence, my family and I look forward to Sunday brunch at Egg Works."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for another place who stands behind their 4.5 Stars, overall rating! Egg Works is work, work it Egg Works, work it! This place is freakin' delicious && I highly recommend.   From the moment we walked in, to the moment we paid our bill I felt very welcomed by the staff, who are genuinely nice!   The food was quickly prepared, then quickly eaten, lol. My hubby ordered the waffles, with a couple eggs and bacon on the side. I appreciate how they brought this out as soon as it was made so that he was able to enjoy the waffles while they were still fresh and hot! Other places would let it sit under heat lamps and bring it out when all the food was done, but not this place- this place is actually thoughtful and considerate! My gf and I ordered the delicious loco moco. Dude, this dish is aaaaaaHmazing! The gravy that's smothered throughout the beef patty is so tasty and add that all up plus my over easy runny egg- boom, you have a heavenly sent dish! So good!   Egg Works delivers and I would totally eat here again!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely phenomenal. Fresh, hot, big portions. Jamie, our server gave us fantastic service with a smile, a great attitude and a priceless personality."}
{"text":"A very neighborhood feel. A mom and pop feel. The service was very fast. You can bring your furry friend as well on the patio. The food was very tasty. The have a train that goes around and the kids love it."}
{"text":"Very good food. Very fast service. Large variety on menu. Something for everyone. They do customize your plate if needed. Good OJ. Decent coffee. Home style cooking. Delicious home made banana muffin comes with a lot of meals."}
{"text":"Oh Egg Works, how I adore you! Of course this chain would become big after I move to Los Angeles. This location is so close to my childhood home, every time I'm in town, I come to eat here. I absolutely love this place!  Today was just another 5 star experience. Amy helped us at the counter and was seriously one of the best servers I've ever had. She knew based off my hesitation between potatoes and fruit, that MAYBE I might want half and half! And guess what? I DID! She was very nice and friendly, kept our water glasses filled and sitting at the counter couldn't have been any better.  I got my usual, the breakfast burrito (traditional one) and my husband got Brad's scramble. He was a huge fan of it because it had mushrooms in it and he wasn't aware it would come like that, but oh well! The toast was great! My breakfast burrito was beautiful made and that Diablo sauce really just tied everything together.  The woman next to me got this beautiful French toast option, if I wasn't trying to watch my weight, I would have easily ran off with her French toast.  Can't wait to eat here again, wish these were in LA! So happy they've become successful in Vegas. :)"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Las Vegas!  We came at 10 AM on a Sunday and had no wait.  Our server was Michelle.  She was very hospitable and super cool.  I've been to Egg & I and knew this place was pretty much the same, so of course I ordered the Stuffed French Toast Sandwich with sausage ($10.25) and chocolate chip pancakes ($9.25 for 3 pancakes) for my dad and I to share.  I've had their chocolate chip pumpkin pancakes before and it  was to die for, but the plain chocolate chips one was less impressive.  They need to add whipped cream to it or something because just syrup doesn't really work with this kind of dish.  The stuffed french toast was amazing, especially with a drizzle of syrup, and their seasoned potatoes were good too.  We also had the banana nut muffins - FREE with a Yelp check-in!  Michelle was an awesome and cool server, refilling our waters without having to ask and just being really there for us when we needed her.  The service was perfect for a Sunday morning right before heading back home.  It's very filling here, so try and order different plates and share because the menu is HUGE!   Credit cards are accepted."}
{"text":"The food was egg-so-lent!  I had the deviled egg pizza. Hands down the the best breakfast out that I've had in a loooooong time.   Diane was our server and she was fantastic. Quick, efficient, and a great sense of humor. She even gave us to-go cups for our coffee when we were leaving! Very friendly and up-beat atmosphere at this place. We will definitely return in the future.  My only constructive criticism is that this place wasn't advertised anywhere. My wife and I only knew about it through Groupon."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing, the service was awesome as well. We were seated right away, our food didn't take long to make at all. She didn't get our orders wrong. I asked for my eggs to be fried hard and they were; they weren't runny at all, the waffle I had was made to perfection and the bacon was so crispy and delicious. I would go here again for sure."}
{"text":"Free warm muffin with a Yelp check-in? Yes please! Giant portions for reasonable prices? Woo hoo! And those crazy delicious potatoes? Yummmm!"}
{"text":"The omelet was perfectly cooked and, even harder to find,  the toast was crunchy.  Thanks to our waitress, Rita, everything was customized just as requested."}
{"text":"My girl had a Groupon so we tried this place for breakfast. They have pretty basic breakfast food options and they get pretty crowded on the weekends. I tried the quiche pizza which could have been better. Just not enough flavor to keep me interested. Service was good and refills kept coming. I felt a bit rushed towards the end when I was still eating and our waitress brought us takeout containers to wrap up our leftovers. I'd come back with another coupon."}
{"text":"it was the best breakfast I have had in a while.  We did not have a wait which was also great.  Our server, Diana, was very helpful and upbeat.  I would come here more if I lived on this side of town."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Always busy on the weekends but they get parties of 2 in super quick. Food is always good and the service is quick and friendly. Reina took care of is today and did a great job. Service definitely on point! Had the ensenada burrito which was great."}
{"text":"Rob is a really bada $$ server, very sociable and professional, food was outstanding, ive never had such good breakfast potatoes,  and the muffins are on point as well, couldnt have been happier leaving"}
{"text":"I am disappointed after ordering a couple of reuben Sandwiches from this place.   We love the Egg Works in Summerlin, and have ordered the same sandwiches from there. The difference is night and day.  Summerlin location is a robust reuben filled with delicious meat, thousand island dressing and kraut.   This sandwich I got today was something I wouldn't feed my dog.  Meat was burnt, and it looked like something threw together with scraps.  Forty dollars wasted.  http://i.imgur.com/qH2YxL5.jpg"}
{"text":"Wow! Great service and friendly.  Food is phenomenal. However, if you are not a lumberjack you might ask for half size portions or share with a friend or two.  The Italian skillet is a favorite also the savory stuffed crepes."}
{"text":"Hmmm, no acknowledgement after being seated, flipped the unhappy face and no one noticed! Finally our busy waiter came and can't stop calling us \"guys\", so finally our food comes from another waiter who calls us guys too! Can't learn them anything! That's why there is help wanted signs posted around the place!"}
{"text":"I use to like coming to egg works at least once every week. It seams service and people they hire gets worst everyday. 2 weeks in the roll I had bad customer service."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, very busy and I'm my humble opinion it's worth it. For sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location.  I had been to Egg and I on Sahara and decided to come here for their Bloody Mary and breakfast.  It was delicious and Alohalina provided great service!"}
{"text":"Life changed forever finding this place!  I have always heard great things... but great is an understatement!  This is by far the best breakfast spot ever!  Our server Penny was incredible, so sweet and made sure we were more than satisfied!  We went when it was super busy BUT with that said we only waited for about 15-20 and once we sat down our food was at our table within 10 minutes!  Blown away by the freshness of the food as well as the portions!  Such a clean and friendly environment as well!  EVERYTHING was so delicious all the way down to the fresh fruit!  Wow, what a gem!  Highly recommended!!!!!  Don't forget to check in and grab yourself a FREE banana nut muffin... to die for... so good!"}
{"text":"Never dissatisfied when I have breakfast here.  Always go for the muffin instead of toast."}
{"text":"So I just moved to Las Vegas today (around midnight, by flight from Chicago - yikes!). Stayed at the Bally's Resort since I came late, but just came to my apartment in Summerlin. I was trying to find a place to eat when my bf suggested Egg Works. I brushed him off and agreed to it because I was tired, hungry and wanted to get it over with.  My first impression of the place was wonderment. The outside patio is misted so that the people enjoying their meals are kept relatively cool, since, you know... it's kinda hot out here. But just a little.  When we came in we were greeted and checked in for a table. In the lobby/waiting area there is a tiny cute train near the ceiling that goes through some of the restaurant and the front. HOW CUTE!! Anyway, the prices were a little high, but we were hungry and the place is really nice so why not.  I ordered the breakfast burrito and my bf ordered the country fried steak. Never would I have imagined that they would produce some delicious food! YUM! Also what an extensive menu!   We thoroughly enjoyed our meals and will gladly come back another time! :)   Great start to my move :)"}
{"text":"Always love to come to this place and it never disappoints. They are very popular and the parking lot is always full, so come early if you have a large party. My country fried steak was absolutely delicious and the Mexican omelette was very flavorful and tasty. Our server Angel was always on point and made sure to keep us happy, so thank you very much to her. We will certainly continue to frequent here in both the near and far future."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing.  Food cooked just as I ordered the first time, very professional, very clean, very good."}
{"text":"I manage a breakfast restaurant, so I am more  picky than the average joe.  My first impression is a diner, not the best kept up establishment. Chipped mugs on the table. Coffee tasted old and burnt. I ordered the basic eggs potatoes and sausage and added a plain cake. I was sad I had to pay the full entree price for both (add on cake price where I manage)   What was great was the muffin. Warm, moist and delicious. I contiplated buying the loaf to take back, but didn't think i would be able to keep it in tack during my  flight home. The pancake was moist, huge and tasty. The eggs were not whole fresh eggs, tasted like the carton kind. I guess I should have ordered overhard. The potatoes were over seasoned and covered in paprika the worst thing I tasted on my whole trip.  I would suggest the muffin only."}
{"text":"Banana nut muffin is a must! SO GOOD! We were a party of 9, and the wait was about 20 minutes on Sunday around noon. Place was poppin'. Our server was really friendly! We were all first timers at Egg Works 2, but my boyfriend and I had been to Egg & I before. We knew what to expect, and Egg Works 2 definitely delivered. Everyone enjoyed their dishes. I really enjoyed the Haole Moco, which is exaclty like a Loco Moco, but they use the house gravy instead. YUM! My boyfriend got the Avocado and Bacon Omlette with Potatoes. OMG I FORGOT HOW GOOD THE POTATOES ARE!!! A MUST TOO! My cousin got the Strawberry French Toast. It was a bit sweet, so ask for the strawberry sauce on the side. I would definitely recommend this place for big or small parties. It a bit off the strip, but worth the drive."}
{"text":"First time here - was invited by friends.  What a great experience!  One of the very best omelettes I have had in recent memory (I had mine with cheese, bacon and sausage).  The banana muffin was recommended by our server and it did not disappoint.  It came out right away hot from the oven and was even more fantastic after I added some butter to it.  Our server was Donna and she was terrific - very friendly and obviously genuine about wanting our experience to be a very good one.  I'll be back every time I visit Vegas - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and it is so good! I love the banana muffins. Today I had the veggie omelette and Donna suggested that I added avocado which made it a million times better. Thanks Donna! :)"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on Friday morning,  let me say, \"eggscellent\", gotta try it. Fast ,friendly service, food was awesome! !!!"}
{"text":"Ariana- Awesome server.....We have had breakfast at this location 3 times and Ariana has given us the best service each time! Kudos to Ariana!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast before heading back home from a weeklong vacation in Vegas. It is located right across the street from McCarran Airport. We arrived at around 10AM on a Friday and the place was pretty busy, but we were seated right away.   All of the staff was super friendly and welcoming. They were quick to get our drink order. Coffee tasted fresh and was good. We chose to sit on the patio, but it was a little noisy because of the planes literally flying right over the parking lot, so low you could practically look in the windows and wave to the passengers. We thought that was kind of fun, but it might be really annoying for some people.   Their menu is quite large, with many, many options. Any kind of egg dish you can imagine is available. I got the Veggie Benny and my husband got the Mexican-style burrito. (I can't remember exactly what it was called, but it has chorizo).   The food came out promptly and looked and smelled incredible! Everything was very fresh. My Veggie Benny had toasted english muffins, topped with grilled tomato slices, fresh sliced avocado, fresh spinach, topped with two perfectly poached eggs and a tasty sauce. I greatly enjoyed it. The potatoes served with it were really delicious, but a little over-seasoned.   My husband's burrito was large and the red sauce it was covered in looked like it was made fresh, not canned. He loved it.   We will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"First timer! Food was great and my server Tina was so attentive and sweet. She gave my daughter and I their famous muffins to go. Will def come back!"}
{"text":"Manny was so great, very nice server might be the best in town. The food is great and lots of it... Allen and I enjoyed this place and the service is wonderful. We will be back."}
{"text":"Had Loco Moco, biscuits& gravy etc. meal was very good, service was fast, and we never had to ask for refills"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast we have had a small dinner like this - Fantastic. Service was great as well!"}
{"text":"I Love this place!!! outstanding customer service, good food, very upbeat, manager walks around and greets customers :)))"}
{"text":"Excellent food came last week and had to come back again food is delish. Had same waitress excellent service"}
{"text":"Not only was it a perfect day for the patio to have a late lunch, but our server NANCY was the best, brought me exactly what I wanted (I can be picky sometimes lol) and always checked up on us throughout our time outside!!!  Breakfast places can all seem the same at times, especially in Vegas, but customer service is never a guarantee. So having great service from our server, Nancy, was awesome!!!!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and if you get here early enough the wait isn't too bad. They can get really busy for breakfast, so come early. We had a coupon, so look out for those."}
{"text":"Came in today for the first time and had the pleasure of having Ashley as our server. She went above and beyond with the quality of service she offered our table. Always making sure we were okay, and not in the annoying \"pushy\" way. The food was great, the banana nut muffins were delicious. I would definitely recommend this place if you find yourself in the area!"}
{"text":"Twila is the bestest. Very friendly and confident about menu. Will be back and request her for sure."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Not a bad deal for the price . overall ill be coming back here when im in Vegas"}
{"text":"This place has great service and huge portions of good food.  The waiter was very nice and attentive. They even gave us a free bottle of the Bloody Mary mix to try later."}
{"text":"Very excellent food! When I came here I fell in love with their French toasts, biscuits and gravy, and chilli relleno omelette."}
{"text":"Raul was the best! He was able to keep the flow of napkins coming to control the spaghetti explosion happening on our 3 year olds face. Attentive and never let our drinks get low. Great suggestions and honest opinions. Always a smile on his face helping patrons or interacting with coworkers. Thanks Raul!! -Ben and Brenda."}
{"text":"This is a very busy breakfast place that it's ridiculous....but we waited. And it was worth it!! It's been over a month since our visit to this location and I forgot what I ordered already. I think it's one of those omelettes HOWEVER, I do remember the banana nut muffin very well. It is the best one that I have ever tasted in my 34 years of existence. I can't wait to be back here on my next visit to Vegas. And this time, I will order these goodies to go. Our server was excellent as he kept checking up on us. Unlike other restaurants where the only time you'll see your server is when you order and when you have to pay. Eggworks please open a location here in Los Angeles :)"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast and amazing food. The service was great and the food came quickly! I ordered the Cabo Burrito and, while the eggs, chorizo and cilantro and the inside were somewhat bland, the salsa on top of the burrito was to die for and made the other flavors stand out!"}
{"text":"Really like the food. Hate that there are Pidgeons everywhere, when sitting outside. They have no spikes near the eating area but they have spikes where no one eats... Get this fixed will you?"}
{"text":"Saw a few of these around Henderson and Yelped it! The wait was a bit much and we had to sit a my a two-person table. We ordered the waffle with strawberries/whip...on the side, turkey sausage and potatoes and the seasoned Chix omelette. It was okay overall. The service was good. They have this egg that you flip if you need service...happy face means you're good, frown means you need service. I felt weird flipping to the frown; b/c I wasn't unhappy, just wanted to add something to my order. Oh and they have a bar and approx 4-5 big screen tvs!"}
{"text":"Dana was our server! She was awesome! Great customer service, fast, friendly and super helpful! Will be coming back because of her great service and our food amazing!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Portion was decent. My typical \"leaving Vegas brunch\". They are very heavy on the sauce, but the specialty sauce is pretty good."}
{"text":"Been to Egg Works location more than a couple timse because it's my fathers favorite place. When we walk in, everyone says hi to him. He feels like a rock star there and that makes me smile.  Breakfast is my favorite meal at Egg Works because there loads of choices. I typically order a veggie omelette (no mushrooms) with bacon and toast, but I have had lunch here too.    The decor is typical for a breakfast joint. I personally like the Egg people etchings in the glass panels inside of the restaurant. They crack me up (no pun intended)!  The location is good and the staff is great. The food comes out fast, tasty and hot. What more can you ask for?   There's one thing this place doesn't have and that's ample parking on Sunday mornings. Other than that, I say go have a big fat breakfast at Egg Works!"}
{"text":"Food was great as usual.  Server was on top of 4-5 tables.  Great job, Ashley! The best thing about egg works is the consistency.  They are great for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"First time tying this place. The Food is mediocre of that. I personally did not enjoy my food the only one good I can say is the banana but muffin was the best thing they had. And the salsa is terrible pros are service was good at least this visit"}
{"text":"Met Mike Tyson of all people here on a previous visit and realized I wanted to update my rating since this place is really great.  It's down home, chill and had solid food!  You get good bang for your buck and there's a wide variety of options here.  The banana nut muffins of course are delish but almost all the egg dishes I've had are solid!  From omelettes to breakfast burritos to scrambles!  Support this local breakfast chain!"}
{"text":"Went here because I heard they had pinball and lo and behold they did!  They had three machines: Austin Powers, Rollercoaster Tycoon and Popeye.  I hadn't really played Austin Powers before so I played it and it played fine as far as I could tell.   I was nicely full from my Santa Cruz Breakfast Burrito which was pretty massive and tasty!  I got it with hash browns and cut those up and mixed them in with each bite of the burrito and sour cream, yum!   It was totally out of my way from where I was staying but I liked the homey feel to the place and it also seemed like a legit locals spot."}
{"text":"I work third shift and got home from work in the morning and asked my girlfriend if she wanted to grab breakfast. I was really craving the works potatoes. We were sat immediately, and our server Timothy was quick to take our drink order, I asked for suggestions with alcohol since it was the end of my day, Timothy was able to name an ample amount of drinks. After our drinks came we were ready to order. Food was great, service was even better."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast here Saturday while in town visiting my dad. Everything was awesome. The banana muffins are the best I've ever had. Our server PK was awesome. He's originally from Hawaii and had this cool vibe. Food was on point, service was on point. Would definitely come back especially because my dad lives in anthem and this is the best place for breakfast up there! Request PK for sure also too."}
{"text":"The locations are only in Las Vegas.  This place is busy on a weekday, and probably really busy on the weekends.  The servings are huge and one order is good enough for two people.  The service was great and the decor is kinda country western.  I had a really good breakfast here.  The French Toast was good with plenty of potatoes on the side.  It is quite far from the strip but worth the drive. You will not leave hungry.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Just stumbled across this place.  Great service and food at reasonable prices.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and had a great time. I took advantage of the free muffin (for yelp). I like how they brought out a whole pot of coffee for my table . I got the biscuits and gravy, and my bf got the Hawaiian bkfsst. Overall I thought the food was very good, and he service was good as well. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I know, I know....I've said many a time that I'm not a breakfast person, but hey, sometimes you have to give in. So, my wonderful meal was a half order of the Greek scramble (Swiss cheese, mushrooms, spinach, artichoke, chicken, and topped with a bit of feta. Yummm.  Friending my scramble was sourdough toast with apple jelly, perfectly crisped, unseasoned breakfast potatoes (yeah, not a fan of seasoning on my spuds), fruit, and a sunrise.  Service is always great and Nicole a peach for putting up with a bunch of punchy Gravers after a 10 hour shift. Today was perfect for breakfast on the patio."}
{"text":"The most awesome banana nut muffin is what you must have with your breakfast...you can get regular ol' toast anywhere, so don't waste the opportunity. Great selection of breakfast items and I especially like the whole wheat or buckwheat options on their pancakes. Christian served us swiftly, with humor, and an awesomely entertaining  (Jersey?) accent. We've been here twice, so far, and from what we see...all the servers are amazing. And for us, that's just as important as good food. \"Glad we had this talk.\""}
{"text":"Ashley H was great!!! So lively and courteous. I hope she wins the trip she is such a sweetheart!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for my late birthday Brunch from my dear friend ELLEN! She's been wanting to try this place so since I was in town we experienced something new together.   We were seated promptly and there were a good amount of people in the restaurant which is always a good sign. I ordered the COUNTRY BENNY Buttermilk biscuits grilled, and topped with patty sausage, covered in their sausage gravy with a side of scrambled eggs. I WAS IN FATTY HEAVEN. I usually get scared ordering anything with gravy anywhere because it always either seems too bland or too runny or too something. BUT LET ME TELL YOU... this sausage gravy was on point. I ate everything off of my plate and my friends plate. That's how much I love egg works. Our server was great too! Sadly, forgot her name, but she had the cutest tattoos on her. She checked on us made sure we enjoyed out meal and gave us a FREE MUFFIN! Maybe she saw me licking my plate and thought I was still hungry ;) Definitely going back next visit!"}
{"text":"A must try breakfast place if your a breakfast lover like myself! I ordered the Santa Cruz skillet and it was awesome the eggs where perfect I got them over easy and I know that it can be hard for some places to get that right, and instead of the toast or banana bread I asked if I can get the biscuits with gravy which was an extra $2.50 but it was good and my boyfriend ordered the chicken fried steak skillet and it was bomb as well, we both really enjoyed our food the potatoes are seasoned so good that you won't wanna stop eating even when your already full and the portions size was really big and filling. Our server was Haley I believe and she was awesome, very friendly and constantly checking on us. The food did take a bit to get to us but totally worth the wait, overall great place and great food definitely recommend"}
{"text":"My husband and I try to eat here at least three times in the year. Ashley was very helpful and convinced my husband to try the day's special, which was delicious. Pretty much any form of the Eggs Benedict is amazing. Also, the banana nut muffin.... Take a whole loaf of the banana nut bread with you!"}
{"text":"Looking for breakfast away from the strip and without a 2 hour wait?  Try this place out!  Egg Works came highly recommended from the yelp pages.  Their breakfast menu is pretty huge so take some time to look it over.  I went with the country fried steak smothered in a nice sausage gravy.  I also got a nice side of linguica  and white rice!  Oh the carnage!  Yes, my arteries may not have been too happy with me but my stomach was content.  Prices are very reasonable with nothing on the menu topping over $14 for the most part.  Well worth the trip of strip!"}
{"text":"Eat here regularly! Servers always friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.   I can say that everything has been served at  the correct temperature and eye appeal!  keep up the consistency!"}
{"text":"From the moment Donna greeted us until we packed up the remaining food, the experience was fantastic.  Great food, great service.  What's not to like!"}
{"text":"We came in seen other tables that would fit us and she placed us by the door when cold air from outside is steadily hitting us and our food. Dumbest place for a table to go. Who wants to eat where all the traffic is coming in and out."}
{"text":"A beautiful, sunny, sunday afternoon and a Cincinnati omelet washed back with a mimosa. It's my day off dream and I'm living it. You better believe with the dog friendly patio outside that my pup will be my next brunch date. Sorry roommie,  I'll bring a doggie bag home ;)"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is crappy!! The host was completely RUDE when I asked to switch tables and they brought us our bill 2 minutes into the meal! What are they trying to say??  Well Like I said the food is good but the staff needs to step it up!"}
{"text":"Came to visit Las Vegas for the first time with my fiancé for our birthdays and anniversary. A thing we love to do is try different restaurants. We came for late breakfast on his birthday. They sat us at a table that I immediately wasn't thrilled about but bit my tongue and was excited to eat. We were greeted a couple minutes after being sat but after we got our drinks we hardly saw our waiter. The food was yummy but the service was mediocre. Also sat without a drink for most of my meal waiting for a refill. It definitely wasn't busy enough for the quality of service we had. It was comparable to dining at Denny's. Doubt we will dine here again."}
{"text":"I love the food and prompt attention at this location. I will be back often! Check in on Yelp fort our free muffin:)"}
{"text":"I love going to eat at egg works. The food is amazing to say the least but our sever Donna was what made the visit pleasurable & fun.  She was very helpful and was fast and efficient. We will be back for sure!  P.s. get the French toast it is soooooo good."}
{"text":"Brady was a great server. I wanted something sweet and he  tried to up sell the banana nut french toast. By the end of the meal we were full so we didn't get the chance to order. Great young kid deserves the trip to Disney"}
{"text":"What can I say, one of the best breakfast places I've been anywhere in all of my travels! They always let Ryan be inventive with his pancakes. In the fall they have pumpkin batter so he has pumpkin pancakes with chocolate AND butterscotch chips.  I love the scrambles and especially love the Blackened Prime Rib and spinach dish! Coffee is amazing and they have fun creamer flavors. Service is awesome and portions are BIG!"}
{"text":"The environment isn't the most fancy or nicest, but the service and the food more than made up for it! Our server, Nashay (hope I spelled that correctly), was AMAZING! Super friendly, helpful, sweet, without being overly intrusive. She really made us feel special, too. Give that girl a raise, cause she has customer service down to a science!  The food as always, was solid. We both got the French Toast combo, and it was more than enough food. Coffee was hot and fresh and Nashay even brought us some flavored creamers.   The yelp check in bonus was a great surprise! Yay muffin!   If you go to Eggworks, you will be in for good food, but if you're lucky, you'll get seated in Nashays section!"}
{"text":"Found this great place on Yelp!  Amazing food, outstanding wait staff. Corned beef hash was incredible!  Banana pancakes were the best!  Make sure you get there early, they stop seating at 3:00!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for almost five years and the service and food quality have always been superb.    Compared to other locations the wait here is minimal even on the Sunday Post church rush.    I get the chicken fried steak skillet because I want to be full for hours :P    MY wife gets the country Benny which is their take on the biscuits and gravy.    My only real gripe is that no matter how we have asked for them my wife never seems to be able to get her eggs without being slightly runny. A small issue and not even close to causing us to pause in eating here.    Donna was our server on our recent trip, and she was very sweet, attentive, and quick to follow up on our requests.   Here's hoping you win the Disney trip!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Wanted to try something away from the strip and this place did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Wanted to try something outside of the strip and this place did not disappoint. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to try it out this morning while vacationing in Vegas. I ordered the steak and eggs and she had the strawberry french toast. All of the staff members were very friendly from the minute we walked in. My steak was served before her french toast... her order didn't come until about 5 minutes or so after I received mine. Food was good and the manager along with our waitress apologized repeatedly for her plate being a little bit late. We didn't mind because the food was good, but the manager went over and above and comped our entire meal. The luxury of a family owned restaurant unlike an Ihop where they would've offered me a free muffin or coffee as an apology. We would visit this restaurant again and we recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"We are in town for a dance convention and needed a yummy breakfast place. This place did not disappoint. Our service was great and the food was wonderful. Thank you Victoria for your recommendations. You were spot on."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great coffee... what more can you ask for? Our server Manuela was polite and very attentive to us even with the moderate to heavy lunch crowd. It was hard to pick one thing from the menu, everything sounded delicious. From our experience everything was delicious.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Ashley H was an awesome waitress! The food was all around amazing and their banana muffins were bomb!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice place to stop for breakfast... Great selection of items & the food is always fresh & served hot.   They are quite busy and you may experience a line & a bit of a wait.  It is worth the wait...  It would be nice if they texted you when your table is ready like some places now do, as then you could do some errands instead of just hanging around.   The staff here are always cool, nice & accommodating. They do come back by the table to check & freshen up your drinks.   Their Eggs Benedict is very nicely done... I especially like the Florentine style here. It is really a great tasting dish!!!"}
{"text":"First of all, we've been here several times, and I love this place. I'm actually surprised I've never Yelped it before, however; our receipt said that Yelping will help our server Timothy win a prize... So I'm down. Today I had spinach Benedict. It was delicious. I would've gone for the full five stars, but they don't put enough lemon in the hollandaise. What I totally dig here is: it's always packed, but I never have to wait for a table. Everyone is so cool, and I hope they're serious about giving unattended children an espresso and a puppy.   I've also spent time (because of work) in Cincy. So I'm all about Cincy chili. There are several versions of this restaurant throughout town. I kinda like the one on Rainbow and 215 better. They have coffee cake and the flavors change regularly."}
{"text":"EGGCITING!!!  First time here,  decor was cute.  My wife is into the decor and cleanliness and she was happy!  And, so was I.  The service was eggcellent and friendly.  We felt like like the locals eating at our secret spot!  My wife had the Brads Scramble and I had the Carnitas.  The Brads Scramble was awesome.  Fresh spinach, mushroom, cheese... yum.  And I am a carnivore.  However, my Carnitas was good but too salty.  To be honest, I couldn't finish it because of the saltiness.    If I lived in Vegas, I would be a regular here.  Good food, nice service, cute decor.  Yup, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Mah first time eating in place.. Service are excellent.. Heather,  our server gives us great service.. Food are great... Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"We have made this place almost a habit, not many weekends have been missed in the last few months since it opened...  Great food (skillets are great, fruit is always fresh)  Friendly and efficient staff  OK atmosphere (a little like your sitting in the barn)  We will continue to go back most weekends when we can"}
{"text":"I come here once a week the staff is very helpful and kind! The food is also very good and The staff lets me continue reading even after I finished my breakfast. They even offer to refill my coffee when most restaurants ignore you after they take the plate away."}
{"text":"Welcomed and seated with NO WAIT. Rare for here. Rosa from Mexicali was our waitress. She gave me her list for Christmas and I gave her an iPhone, iPad, and a car...she gave us complimentary muffins.   The muffins were wonderful. The coffee hot and smooth, the avocados in the omelet were scrumptious.   We had a great experience and I want to take Rosa home. I want to take all these folks home and into a kitchen just like this but at my house.   I am never disappointed here. Merry Christmas; Happy Hannakah.  Santah"}
{"text":"Everything was good, not great, including service and waiting, except the crepes. Free WIFI was great. In my opinion crepes are supposed to be really thin, but mine was thick. Just short of being pancake thickness. I asked if mine was a mistake, but waitress said that's how they all are. You can even see the egg it's made with."}
{"text":"Came in here between running errands for a quick bite to eat....ended up getting the steak and eggs. My steak was cooked perfectly as well as my eggs. The home potatoes are seasoned with some kind of special season they have....awesome.    Bathrooms were super clean.  My server was Kat...she was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Always a solid breakfast choice. While there is usually a wait on weekends, turnover is pretty quick, and the wait is not long. It is busy, but they get people in and out!  The menu, printed on newspaper print, is about 10 pages long, with lots of omelette and egg concoctions.  They also have pancakes, waffles, french toast, and lunch/dinner options. It is set up like a diner with very simple decor.    I've tried a few of the omelettes, the pancakes, and the french toast and everything I've tried has been tasty- with large portions! I usually need a to-go box and can make another meal out of my leftovers.  The potatoes are yummy! Seasoned very well (a little overly salty for my taste), diced, crisp but not dry or crunchy, and lots of them.  The meal starts with a warm banana nut muffin, which is delicious!   Today, I tried the Stuffed French Toast, which is like a french toast sandwich- stuffed with cheesy eggs scrambled with your choice of meat. I am sure I didn't eat it correctly, because I \"unstuffed\" the french toast so I could eat it separately. The egg/cheese/meat (I got sausage) was great, but the French Toast was just okay. It was a bit dry and thin.  I think I might have fared better had I ordered things separately.  My dining companions loved their meals- a Bandito Scramble and the Strawberry Cream Cheese French Toast. Everything came out piping hot (which I LOVE).  Coffee was great (they will provide a carafe of it so you can fix your own refills), and they had a variety of creamers on the table as well as sugar, equal, and splenda.   Service was great! Our server was friendly, funny, personable, and quick.  They have a system where you can just flip an egg (a little plastic egg on a stand that's on your table) from black to yellow if you need anything additional.  They had everything you could think of on the table, though- from hot sauce to jelly to butter to ketchup.   I left full and happy- so EggWorks met my egg-spectations!"}
{"text":"Our server was Amy and she did a great job taking care of us, drinks were filled and food came out super fast.  I would recommend this place to anyone wanting good food and service, I only eat breakfast food when I come here but I have not had a bad meal yet and I would assume if they serve it, it will be good!"}
{"text":"This place cares for their customers. They care about the food and they provide!   The wait is reasonable and should actually be longer and I wouldn't mound the wait.  It's hard to compete with the strip but this place beats them hands down.  The staff are friendly very focused.   We had a party of five and nothing was missed.  We enjoyed our meals and were ready for the rest of the day.  The manager noticed that I didn't receive my food in the same time as my group and offered me a to go serving of their famous banana nut muffin. So yummy!   I enjoyed a banana waffle with whipped cream, eggs over easy and bacon... again so yummy!   My brother enjoyed his country fried steak and so did my friends.  I'll definitely be back again when in Vegas.  The place was clean and the crew were very polite.  See you guys soon!   Thanks for the excellent service."}
{"text":"Do not go here if you are a whiny calorie counter! This place serves large portions and the food is really good. Eggs made a lot of different ways, pancakes, waffles, and yummy potatoes. The biscuits and gravy are very good too. Had to try the buttermilk pancakes (just because) and they were so good. I inhaled it.  My new favorite place for breakfast, but they also serve lunch as they are open til 3:00 p.m."}
{"text":"This place is Aaaamazing!! Hearty meals for affordable prices. Everything is flavored very well. The corn beef hash is a must try!! The food and service makes you feel like you are in a mom and pop shop not a chain restaurant. I'm full and still ready for more!"}
{"text":"Wow. Raul was amazing. I told him I was on a tight timeline and he got me in and out so fast. Food served in generous portions and tasted great. Service was amazing. Look forward to coming back again with more family. ^.^"}
{"text":"Food 2.5. Service 4.  I'm not an American breakfast lover so my review can be viewed as skewed.  I ordered the Chile Relleno Omelet with a side of potatoes. I didn't like my dish because the egg was overcooked and somewhat rubbery. Also, the omelet was really thick and it had way too much bland cheese on top of it and also inside of it. And the red salsa on top was so ambigous; it didn't taste like tomato, it wasn't spicy, what was it? It was convenient that the potatoes were cubed into small bite sizes but it was definitely overseasoned; my husband didn't like the ratio of surface area:seasoning and I completely agree with him. I tried the banana nut muffin but it wasn't worth the calories so I only ate the spillage of the muffin top and ignored the rest. The coffee was swallowable but it had the typical diner taste. On a positive note, it helped me \"go\" after breakfast so it was somewhat useful.   On the other hand, the service was good. The waitress was quick, attentive, and simply put \"did her job well.\"   Conclusion: Maybe I ordered the wrong dish? I really wanted to like it, sorry!"}
{"text":"It is a good place if it is not a weekend morning when they are packed... Every time we try to go on a Sunday there is a really long line:(  The checkout is a not the best part and I would like it if they allowed you to just pay the waitress at your table.  It would seem that the waitress would get better tips that way!  I am looking for another breakfast place in the area, as I am too impatient to wait when I am starving... So send me your recommendations."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong here! The muffins hot and fresh. You can't beet the corn beef hash with two over easy eggs. They also have the best wait staff around"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here for what we hoped was a nice breakfast and a way to kill some time while our car was being fixed.  I was wrong on both levels.  This place is not only fantastic and magical but they're crazy fast to boot.  I've never been so happy to be wrong!  -:P  We walked in and most (if not all) of the tables were full.  It was quite bustling with the servers quickly moving about as well as hostesses seating people.  Placed our name on the list, was told it was about 10-15 minutes and sat outside.  I don't even think it was 5 minutes when we were called and sat.  Cool.  The menus are newspaper-style (cute!) and there was also a special laminated menu for, well, specials.  Derp.  Service was always efficient and super-polite by our awesome server (who wore a cute egg-themed shirt over her baby bump); we were never left without.  My fiancé ordered sides and she made it a combo so we'd save money; I opted for the spam and eggs and rice meal!  Om nom nom.  We also were super excited to be in a non-bar/casino-type place and still order mimosas.  Super delish.  Everything tasted great and came out so quickly, but did not feel rushed in the least.  If you eat eggs, please go here - they know eggs better than eggs know eggs.  Seriously.  I rarely ever get scrambled eggs because most restaurants make them weird - this place made them to fluffy, delectable perfection.  Spam slices were thick and the sticky rice was better than at most Asian restaurants!  And the banana nut muffin is indescribably delicious.  Just... put it in your mouth and enjoy.  Prices are reasonable for a breakfast place - if you don't order alcohol (oops) - and sure as heck beats IHOP/Denny's.  Must come back to try all the other things on the menu that sounded amazing, like the breakfast burrito and spaghetti chili!"}
{"text":"We just ate at egg works after Black Friday shopping. Veronica was a great waitress. Very knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations. We loved the food and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My journey to egg works all started when I woke up this Saturday morning from a long night of raving at this life in color paint party. As you could imagine I was exhausted from the night before and me and my friend Sarah aka: Linda strolled in there looking crazy as shit! We had paint caked in our matted hair and we had no shame, we needed breakfast!!! Out wait was 15 minutes, which wasn't bad compaired to call the people outside the building. We finally got sat and Eden was our server. He was amazing, very sweet and despite how insane we looked, we didn't feel judged for one second! He got our drinks super fast and returned to take our order. We order the biscuits and gravy, mushroom ham skillet, and a half stack of French toast. Hahaha were out of control, but that's besides the point! Our food was great! Every single bite we enjoyed and had a really good time, the energy was flowing and I love the positivity of Eden! Great job egg works, and great job Eden! They're very lucky to have him as their employee!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Oregon! First timers and the reviews definitely lived up to the  expectations. Our server, Jason, was superb! He was friendly and courteous! Will return before we leave!!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place! Country Benedict is definitely to die for! Staff is friendly and always efficient!"}
{"text":"Nothing \"eggs traordinary\" bout this place. I was expecting to be wowed. Don't get me wrong the food was good but it was basic. I must say the banana muffin was super good!!! We tried the crazy chicken omelette and the maple bacon French  toast.  The French toast looked better than it tasted. The omelette was filling but lacked flavor. Our waiter was friendly and our food came out quick. If i could of given it a 3 1/2 star i would of.."}
{"text":"I would go back this place is yum-my. I ordered the chicken fried steak skillet. Their seasoned home fries were super flavorful, chicken fried steak cooked perfectly and there was a lot of it. I really liked the concept of the skillet, I have not seen this skillet option on another menu. Big portions - I couldn't finish mine. If you are considering this place as an option do yourself a favor and go....now :)"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Always walk out of here completely satisfied. From the service to the quality of their meals this is one of our favorite breakfast/lunch spots!   This time Brandt was our server he was Great! Very friendly, perfect service timing, follow up was also great. Didn't have to wait on him for anything.   We typically get the classic Benedict, Loco Moco and always get the side muffin. The muffin always completes the meal for me it's my favorite side item."}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast spot! We've never had a bad meal. The banana nut muffins are to die for! It's a great family restaurant!"}
{"text":"They don't take American Express.  I don't get that.  Charge a little more for a meal to recover your cost, but let us eat.  The company that I work for issues the Amex.  While I am not a fan of the card, I am surprised at the number of businesses, mostly small \"ma and pa\" outfits, that don't take it.  I've even eaten at restaurants that have the Amex sign on their door, yet don't take the card.  Oh well, I suppose companies don't need the business."}
{"text":"Great place to eat breakfast, my fiancé and I love coming here and the food is always amazing! You definitely get your money's worth because the portions are huge! Our server was Veronica, she was great! Not too pushy but made sure we were taken care of, ask for her.   Strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Disappointing this time. Food was average and service was below average. I've had great experiences in the past, but wait staff was more interested in their phones and conversation than taking my order or bringing my food. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast Experience Across the Board!  Loving the atmosphere, fantastic service and most of all the great quality food! Cannot wait until my next visit. Enjoyed a banana nut muffin just for juice g in on yelp! Mexican omelet was outstanding and I so appreciated the spicy taste that was so satisfying! Potatoes were quite enjoyable too! Ambiance was enjoyable and relaxing as well    It may be bay when you arrive by looking at the parkng lot however was seated right away and the food is so worth the wait even on a weekend busy day!    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food is extremely awesome! It was my second time their but officially first to have a meal! I love their version of the loco moco! Servings are portioned very largely ! It's so amazing that it will give you a food coma! The house gravy is just simply delish!Oh I almost forgot their coffee bread Oh my gosh! Thats all i can say!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Service was awesome! Everyone seemed to enjoy their job. Food was GREAT and out to us within a timely manner! Wish I had a egg works where I live! Definitely recommend trying if you're ever in Vegas."}
{"text":"It's my second time to eat breakfast here  last time was 6 mons ago the service was quick and servers r very friendly, portions can be shared by 2 if you r small eater which my husband n I are. Cool menu lots of choices we tried Chili Omelette I'll rate it as a 2/5 the seasoned potatoes overly spiced too salty for us didn't eat it next time will do fruits instead and try something different .i like it when they give you the coffee pot you don't need to wait for them to pour you the next one . I don't think I'll be back here soon lots of other places to try."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Egg everything. Anything egg concoction you can think of, they have a cool idea. They have small signs on the table you flip if you need something, so you don't have to wait for the waiter to come around and ask, and you don't have to try to gesture someone over if you need something. One very good sign, this place is always very very busy! It's kind of odd that they are only open until early afternoon, kind of seems like a waste of a building, but they are so busy, that breakfast must pay for everything."}
{"text":"I was so relieved to find this no frills, kinda like home, restaurant in Vegas. Off the strip, Eggs Works is a casual restaurant where you can get any breakfast food item from country fried steak to regular eggs, pancakes, the list goes on. I ordered a skillet with no meat and fruit. My eggs were perfect, the cheese was melted with the eggs nicely on top of a buttery croissant, Heaven. My potatoes were not greasy but well-seasoned which I appreciated. Our food came out in good time and the service was great. They have a smiley face system, if you show the sad face, someone will come over promptly to correct an issue.  What prevented them from being a 5 star place is the fact my fruit wasn't pleasing. I had a slice of cantaloupe, a grapefruit slice, a pineapple slice, and something else. Eh. I was expecting diced fruit. Also, my friend ordered eggs with cheese. The first time they came out, no cheese. The waitress apologized and took them back. The second time they were brought out, the slice cheese was sitting on TOP of the eggs not melted. If it wasn't for her boyfriend, they would have heard a mouthful out me.   Despite those two issues, I would go back. Fast service, filling foods, and decent prices."}
{"text":"Candice...The Bomb Waitress!! Always has a smile for us! Best restaurant in Sin City!"}
{"text":"Roslin did a fabulous job! The food was great and the service better. Checked in for a free banana nut muffin. Good times."}
{"text":"We were happy to find a place open at 6:00am for breakfast. they were playing quiet country music. The coffee was so-so but the spinach benedict was good, if a bit salty. Service was excellent, but then again we were the only people in the place! The banana nut muffin 9free with Yelp check-in) was a bit overdone but tasty."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a bit obscure but I saw it one day running errands in the plaza where it is so I made a note to bring the family here on the weekend for a late breakfast.  We went Saturday and the place was packed but we were seated within 10 minutes.  The waiter arrived promptly and took our drink orders.  The food took a long time to come from the kitchen but as I said it was packed.  I was impressed with how they kept the tables cleared and kept seating the customers.  The menu looks like a newspaper and reads a bit like one too.  A lot of selections including breakfast and lunch items.  We all decided to have breakfast.  I'm not a big eater and was going to simply have one egg with toast and was happy to see it on the menu; however, at almost $9.00 like wow!  So I decided for a few more dollars to go ahead and pig out, sigh.  I had the waffle with fruit, bacon and 2 eggs.  It was tasty but nothing spectacular.  My husband had the porkchops which he wasn't impressed with.  Our son had some kind of egg burrito which had too many green peppers that were raw.  They were very accomodating to remake it without the peppers which was nice.  He enjoyed it finally.  The restaurant and the restrooms were very clean.  The staff was hustling and doing a good job.  I probably won't go back because the prices were very high for the quality of food that you got.  The serving sizes were adequate.  I just can't get over the prices for food that isn't anything to brag about."}
{"text":"Yo the banana bread served in the beginning was so good! Soft, sweet, moist. Very banana-y.  Unfortunately, the food that was served for us was just ok. Nothing special. Equivalent to the kind of food you'd receive from eating at a diner."}
{"text":"This place is called Egg Works, so you come here for the eggs. Screw the sandwiches and no egg dishes. All I do know is that the mushroom and cheese omelet is the best I have ever had. The \"Three Pigs\" omelet is amazing too. This is saying alot given then I am not a breakfast person and would skip it on a daily basis. I have also had the California Crepe. It is alright. Nothing spectacular.   Now for the sides. Almost all the egg dishes comes with potatoes which really suck. Yes, I will eat a couple of pieces but I typically give it to someone else. Another side is the banana nut muffin. It looks very unappetizing, but it isn't bad. Imagine a flat top muffin that looks like someone was tilting the muffin tray as it was cooking.  The service is typical diner. Nothing fancy or special."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service. Great place for a team breakfast in their back room."}
{"text":"Love love love coming here for breakfast and lunch! People are so friendly!  Victoria was the server today is was so happy and made my experience here amazing. Very happy and energetic lady.   I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Great place to have a good breakfast!! Everything was really good and great service!! 5stars for u 2 Candice!!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the Egg Works on rainbow and both times I've come here I have not been pleased with the service. Being that my business has moved to this side of town and I love the food I decided to stop in here and have been disappointed. Both times they forgot a food item in my bag with my pickup order ! To drive all the way back to a restaurant during lunch hour is such a hassle. Then, when I called the manager to let her know my muffin was missing she said \"well the cooks said they even gave you 2 muffins and threw in a free muffin.\" Lady, do you really think I would call all the way back to a restaurant to lie over a missing muffin ????? Seriously. Smh.  Then I order a kids juice for my son, and the cashier says its a large juice and it was a kids size juice for $2.70. That's way too expensive for a kids size juice which is even weird because their menu is not expensive at all !  Double check your bags before you leave !"}
{"text":"Stopped by Egg Works before heading back to LA after reading about it in a little magazine that was in the taxi. We decided to make the trek out because of the free breakfast entree coupon. The yelp reviews looked great, so we decided to head to Egg Works instead of a typical Sunday brunch on the strip. Whenever we woke up that Sunday morning, we packed and stumbled to the car to get some breakfast. After about a 20 minute drive from the strip, we finally arrived at Egg works.   The place is relatively big, so the wait for 3 wasn't about 15 minutes. After being seated, we were promptly served drinks and then was left to look over the extensive menu. I decided on a side order of the corned beef hash and the Green Chili omelet. The omelet was extremely large. It probably had 3 whole Ortega chilies, a ton of cheese, and another ton of cheese on top. The omelet was good, but nothing special. Along with the omelet came a side of home potatoes that seemed like it was tossed with a whole bottle of Lawry's season salt. If you like that stuff, then you'll love these potatoes. If not, I'd see if they can cut the season salt next time. The corned beef and hash was interesting. It was more like corned beef and mashed potato pancake that was crisped on the flat top.   Overall, if you have time to venture beyond the strip, check Egg Works out. You won't be hungry after the meal."}
{"text":"My experience here was amazing not just for the food but for our server Manuela. I suggest if you ever eat here you ask for her because she is great."}
{"text":"Eggscellant breakfast. Omelette are all you can ask for. Start off with a Bloody Mary too! Ask for Drea - greatest server!!!"}
{"text":"Roslin was our server and she was very polite, courteous and funny. She made sure to check on us and to make sure we were satisfied."}
{"text":"I've always been good at following directions, so here's my review for Egg Works. We were very impressed with our server, Nancy, for providing 5-star prompt and friendly service! My favorite dish here is the chile relleno omelet. It's enough food for an entire week and a guaranteed hangover cure. I usually drink 10 cups of really good black coffee while dining here. The food and karma is infinitely better than the Cracked Egg and Nancy is a great server. :)"}
{"text":"Been here probably 5 times in the past 3 months and they simply do not miss a beat.  Food is always PERFECT,  service AMAZING and just overall a wonderful place to spend your morning and money.  Very thankful to have them in the Southwest and hope they never leave!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this WAS probably our go-to breakfast joint every time we crave for a good breakfast. Usually come here about once every two weeks. But the last time we went....our food was not all that great. Now of course, as soon as we walked in we got seated. Didn't like where we were placed because we like a little privacy...so we asked the lady hostess if we can be moved and she said yes and placed us near the back by the kitchen (which was not too bad).  We ordered, and waited about 20 minutes until our food came out. Our banana nut muffin were the first things that came out. Probably the best thing we had from them. Now the worst thing about being at a restaurant is seeing & hearing all the arguments in the kitchen. This is exactly what happened. We heard complaints from the kitchen workers, and the waiters and just everything we didn't want to....nor need to really hear.   Soon as our food came out, it was super salty and soggy!!! My boyfriend ordered the skillet and I had the homemade corned beef hash. Everyone loves a little salt here and there...but having too much, I thought I was going to have a heart attack! Then we got our checks and left.  Overall it was a bad experience and I don't think we'll return to this place again. Such a shame because we loved this place and it's close to our place. I hope we find another breakfast joint soon."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful delicious and quick brunch with friends.  Great service and food and atmosphere.  I love egg works,  I go to many of the locations and they're all consistently delicious and everything is perfect."}
{"text":"Its a great place to eat. Our server \"PK\" is awesome! Very helpful. Traditional Benedict and stuffed french toast is delicious."}
{"text":"Awesomeness at its finest!!! Jennifer was our server and she was FANTASTIC!!!! I've been here many times and I've never met anyone who wasn't happy or not enjoying their day!!! Definitely will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Ashley was our waitress and she was so friendly and helpful! Our groups got chile rellenos omelette, the works skillet, taco skillet, and banana pancakes and everyone loved it! The banana nut muffin was also delicious! Portions are large, but I think you can halve the meals. Can't wait to come come back and try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!!! Egg-cellent service and food!!! Took my son for his free kids meal for being an 'egg-cellent' student at school. Great to see Egg Works honors good students in school. As always waiter was very attentive."}
{"text":"First time at this location, as usual we were greeted with all smiles every time we visit any Egg Works or Egg & I. Mariyah was our waitress and she was honest to tell us she was still in training. We ordered the Veggie omelette and a country fried steak breakfast. There was a mixup on the Veggie omelette, but it was fixed right away. Food was great as always. Doesn't matter which location you visit, it will always be a great experience."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast and love the dog patio. Staff is friendly and facility is always clean. Haven't had a bad experience yet! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This was busy when I arrived at 12:30. I was eating alone so I was able to eat at the bar. I first ordered banana pancakes then biscuits and gravy w/ homefries. The pancakes had about 7 slices 1/4\" thick of banana per cake. Good but more is always better. The biscuits were so so just normal run of the mill store bought.  Overall it is good and filling. It hit the spot."}
{"text":"Emily and her protégé took great care of us. We are always happy to find Loco Moco. Nice getting your own thermos of coffee. Nice, big menu which is good when one person wants breakfast food and someone else wants lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I always make a trip here when I travel to vegas. The muffins are terrific! We had the Mashed Potato Omelette, you read that right, and it was exactly what you Imagine. It filled all of the holes in our hearts, and I had a scramble. Its very good and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Fire breakfast for a really good price! We ordered the Baja Burrito which was really nice with the enchilada type sauce on top. Inside was delicious! We also had the chili cheese skillet that had potatoes and over easy eggs on top. For the side we had a small stack of OG pancakes that were just alright in flavor. Service was really good and food came out super quick! Good choice"}
{"text":"Great food if you are looking to get off this Strip for a great breakfast. Be careful about portions, very large and easily can be split. We ordered the skillets which were incredible and the waffles. Highly recommend. Preferred this meal over our buffet at Wynn yesterday."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot!   Love their waffles with fruit and whip cream. Had the bananas this time and it was very delicious. The waffle was made just right! Definite must try!  The service here is always friendly and around when needed.  Love the egg card that's up that customers can flip if they need someone, cute idea!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, economical, and had an excellent deal on Groupon. The fresh, free muffin was delicious and the service was 5 stars. I am sad Savannah doesn't have one but look forward to my next visit to Vegas to partake in this nice treat."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I wish I would have tried the banana nut muffin! But alas, I didn't, and still had a very tasty breakfast.   I had a fantastic skillet breakfast and my husband had his usual Cincy chili omelet. We love love love us some Cincinnati chili and they do it well here. The potatoes here are amazing. My skillet had a layer of potatoes, bacon, onion, over easy eggs and melted cheese ( I won't mention the 2000 calories my trainer figured it had - but hey...I only ate half of it!).  It gets very busy, but the wait isn't that bad because they have a humongous staff. Also, there's a breakfast bar in the back if you're in a hurry and don't mind not having a table."}
{"text":"What a great find for us. As first timers we weren't sure what it would be like. When the waitress (Donna) found out that we were first timers she brought all three of us banana nut muffins fresh out of the oven. Unbelievably delicious. The food was fantastic for my two companions, but my eggs benedict were very salty and I could only eat one. When I mentioned it to Donna I was blown away by the response. She brought us a loaf of banana nut bread on the house and took the charge off of the bill. She also gave us some discount tickets for the next time we came in. It was above and beyond. We will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas. Excellent, excellent experience."}
{"text":"Jay was awesome! Food was great as usual. Eggs Benny and crepes are the bomb Patio service was great"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! One of the best breakfast/brunch place in town. All the Egg Works and Egg and I all over town is good. Service is good and the portion of the food is huge.   Everytime my boyfriend and I go here the staff is always so friendly and so attentive.   Their coffee and nice and strong for all those coffee drinkers (coffee lovers)."}
{"text":"The waitress Veronica was awesome! Nice and always attentive to my needs. And she actually came back with what I request because some waitresses seem to forgot what you asked for.  Great service. 4 stars because my choice of meal was not that great."}
{"text":"I forgot how great this place is.   Our sever Eddie was very helpful and he went above and beyond to help.  This place is a unique way to eat traditional home style food.  It sounds like just a breakfast place but it is so much more."}
{"text":"Yup.  It's good.  The food is VERY good.  The service is a bit slow.  Hence only 3 stars.  We were there when it wasn't even half full and had to wait and wait for our check, then a to-go box later.  Kind of a waste of time.  We had better service before when they were swamped in the AM on a Saturday.  This was late lunch on a Monday. Should have been better.  The Cincy Chili though, is impressive."}
{"text":"My family and I came in on a weekday morning. Our waiter was SUPER friendly. She was exited to give us their freshly baked banana muffins- which were so fresh, fluffy and yummy! The food was very generic. No gourmet style sauces or special recipes. The potato wedges tasted like any other. There are heathy options but mostly the pancake, egg, cheese... More cheese... and did I mentioned cheese? Service was great, love the banana muffins and okay food."}
{"text":"Always everything I expect from a brunch spot. The portions are very unselfish. I always bring out of towners here."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars because it's so rare that you find a breakfast place that is so good that you no longer have any doubt where you will be going for breakfast in the future! The bacon was crispy and not greasy, all the bread was outstanding freshly baked. Of course they are famous for their eggs and I have to say they are excellent. The menu is just a dream and you can get breakfast or lunch, soups, chili all of it is really really good. Beyond that the service is exceptional they obviously go the extra yard to make sure everyone is well trained and very friendly to the customer. This place is a no brainer if you're nearby and or even across town!"}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. Our server Victoria was courteous and always on top of everything. I will def be returning."}
{"text":"Here's a good sit down breakfast, without the wait.  Convenient and quick spot to grab a bite and start the day.  This menu is the closest I'll ever get to anything resemblance of a newspaper. So many choices!  For sure something for everyone. Sweet local service.  Their egg flip service alert ensures you'll never have to wait long for anything you need.  I have to say my corned beef hash was more oily than I would have liked. The eggs were cooked perfectly.  Overall it hit the spot. Best of all 4 people in and out less than an hour!"}
{"text":"EVERYTIME I eat here, all the servers and hostess are extra friendly and welcoming. They seem like genuinely happy people.  Their smiles are always contagious. Today we are sitting outside.  I should have worn sunglasses. No spectacular view, just the parking lot and cars on Eastern Ave. the radio is on the speakers. The sun feels nice with the cold air. The menu is in news paper fashion. I had apple juice and a breakfast burrito with egg whites and a side of sour cream.  I would give the food 3 stars.  Our server has the same name as me. She was very nice and attentive like all the servers I have had here.  They have an egg that you flip to alert for service, but I haven't ever needed to use it. They have a good variety on their menu and it is one place that I can order something different every time. For two of us our check came out to $22."}
{"text":"Consistent! I know no matter which Egg Works I visit, I'll receive great service, and reasonably priced food that tastes good too. This location is no different.  It gets busy here on weekends, but during the week it's easy to get a table for breakfast or lunch. If you have a large group I would suggest their S Rainbow/215 location, as this one is a bit smaller inside.   They have lots of menu options, and I've never had an issue getting something substituted. Whether you are wanting egg whites and tomato slices, or a mashed potato stuffed omelette loaded with cheese and bacon, you will find something here!   They also sell their seasonings at the counter, which I often pick up for friends who live out of town - this is a favorite breakfast spot for almost everyone I've brought here."}
{"text":"Another go to for eggs and brunch while in Vegas. Good food :) mimosas (heart) and the service hit and miss since the place is always packed."}
{"text":"I had no idea this was right down the street from the house. Me and my fiancé usually drive to the one on Flamingo. Service was excellent! Our server was Ashley. Wait wasn't bad for a Sunday about 15 mins. Will be back! Make sure to check in for the free banana nut muffin!"}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict here is primo! Always love this place. Large portions, good service. And they serve mimosas. A+"}
{"text":"Wanted to get a quick breakfast bite and was worried it would be too busy. In fact it was, but it was just me and my boyfriend so they directed us to the bar right away! From there we had a great server who seemed to check on us at the right times. There was so much to choose from the menu. I would say this place gives very generous amounts of food and worth every dollar. I ordered the chipotle turkey Benny and I could only finish half. Also, if you check in, you get a free banana nut muffin which was extremely delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely flavourless food!  I don't understand how they got that rating. Had very high expectations after yelping them."}
{"text":"Always great service and great food! Parking isn't great but they have a fast turnaround so there isn't too long of a wait."}
{"text":"Now our favorite place to eat breakfast.  Our server Nicole was fantastic, always there to ensure our experience was fabulous.  Good job, well done."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE their banana nut muffins. But it isn't quite the same anymore... everything is okay... but nothing special.Its about $10-$15 per person for breakfast. Coffee isn't great. Service isn't bad, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Came here by accident while getting out of Vegas. What a great accident. Quick and super friendly service, yummy food and reasonable price. Ironically, this was our best meal after 4 days in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Good portion. Fair price. Friendly service.  The portion size is adequate for the amount of seasoned hash browns. The flavor was great in both the works veggie Benedict and the veggie crepe. The service was very friendly and accommodating. They could probably cut back a little on the hash browns but because the item was such a good size, I wasn't upset at all, its just that I like to finish my entire plate but if I did, it would've been a lot...too much, which isn't exactly bad but being a former chef, I pay attention to food waste. From a customer point of view it's great, though. Plus, they are deep fried hash brown diced cubes. It cancels out my recent quest for healthy breakfast of eating more veggies. All in all it was great flavor and service so not bad.   I would recommend to any fellow breakfast connoisseurs."}
{"text":"This is usually my go-to breakfast after a long night of drinking/partying. It's close to my house, the service is always good, and the food is consistently tasty.   I have tried many different menu items including the Eggs Benedict, the country fried steak skillet, the banana bread french toast, the classic breakfast, and the avocado/bacon omelette.   The food always comes out fast and the portions are very big. This isn't \"the greatest breakfast on the planet\" but it hits the spot every time and I have never ordered something I didn't end up enjoying.   I really, really love their sourdough toast. And, their \"breakfast potatoes\" are absolutely phenomenal. The seasoning is delicious.   Plan and simple: you cannot go wrong with breakfast here."}
{"text":"Shantel is an awesome waitress! I had the Chile relleno omelet, it was delicious!  Will definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"With lots of clean tables available, the hostess said it would take an additional 5-10 minutes. In addition, their prices are EXTREMELY high, considering breakfast is the cheapest meal to prepare and serve. The only time I'd return to this hash house is when they go out of business and a new establishment takes over."}
{"text":"My best friend and I come here frequently but I've never been compelled to write a review as it's usually just standard breakfast and nothing extraordinary. Today was different. The food is always on point but the service today is what made the difference.  Our server Victoria was spunky, attentive and genuine. I don't know if she likes what she does but it sure felt like she loves her job. The service was by far some of the best I've had. Both of us are servers so we are pretty observant about the hustle and bustle of a restaurant. She's a Rockstar."}
{"text":"Awesome food, inhuman portions (in a good way) and our server Luanna was friendly and fast! My son loves the train rolling around the restaurant."}
{"text":"The banana muffins are the best.  The food was just ok. Friendly service. The place is cute and clean."}
{"text":"Love this breakfast place!  We found this place on Yelp while we were in town and we immediately made plans to try it. It did not disappoint! The restaurant is spacious and had lots of room. Although it looked busy, we found two seats at the counter immediately. We were greeted by helpful and happy staff to take our order.   Consist with the other review, the banana nut muffins are delicious! They were warm and super moist! We ordered the country fried steak skillet and the Denver omelette. LOVED BOTH DISHES!!! I especially loved the gravy on top of my fried potatoes and my country fried steak.  Will post a picture of my country fried steak skillet. :)"}
{"text":"Always busy, the food is always very good and my waiter, James was friendly and attentive. Had the bacon avocado omelette and banana nut muffin..all were served quick and hot ..every table is occupied!"}
{"text":"This place is a good breakfast joint. I've been here a few times and have gotten various things and I don't have really any complaints about it. Service is okay and pretty much have had an overlall friendly experience which is never a bad thing.   I do like that this place is open later compared to other breakfast joints. So if you do wake up later you don't have to rush to the place. I do recommend getting the banna nut muffin though. It's pretty good."}
{"text":"I just love this place!  I took the family here for breakfast before heading to the airport for our annual trip to Disney and the food and service was great as usual.  Donna was our server and was very friendly and made our breakfast extra special.  Definitely will return!!!"}
{"text":"The menu is extensive and there's a great selection of breakfasts and lunches to choose from. It took me a while to decide what I wanted to order. Meanwhile, since I checked in, I immediately showed our server the free banana muffin offer when she took our drink order. She happily pushed the button on my phone to claim the offer and  promptly returned with a nice warm delicious muffin. My husband got the corned beef hash and eggs. It was yummy.   I ended up ordering the garlic mashed potato omelette, which has bacon, egg, cheese, garlic mashed potatoes, green onions, and a dollop of sour cream on top.  I noticed that all of the omelettes came with their hash brown potatoes, so I asked our friendly server about it. She wittingly said, \"You can get fruit instead of the potatoes if you don't want 3 kinds of potatoes...\" So that's exactly what I did.   It was delicious! I ate very bite. Yum to the 10th power!!! The fresh fruit consisted of a watermelon triangle, a slice of honeydew, a slice of cantaloupe (hiding under the honeydew), a slice of pineapple, AND an orange wedge. Wow! Since both of our meals included a choice of bread or muffin, both of us asked if we could take our banana muffins to go.   As we were checking out at the register, my husband asked, \"Do you guys make and bottle your own hot sauce?\" She replied, \"Yes, and we have groves for the banana muffins...\" LOL!   We had a nice visit and will be sure to return next time we are in town. Thanks for the great food and awesome service, Egg Works!"}
{"text":"This 5th location, even though brand spanking new is up & running like a well oiled machine.  Anticipate this to be the busiest one considering there aren't too many choices up in Anthem for a good breakfast joint.    Our party only had to wait for about 15 minutes...not bad considering the (beyond) full house.  My blackened prime rib benny was better than I've ever had it at any of their older locations.  Lightning fast service with a smile & all expectations were met.  The waitress even gave me one of their banana nut muffins...she said she didn't want me to feel left out.  I usually don't do muffins, but I ate every moist crumb on the plate.  The only negative was the line to pay heading out the door about 10 checks deep.  Not a deal breaker as everyone seemed fat & happy.  Nice to have one of these joints so close by!"}
{"text":"This place has better food, service and prices than the much hyped and over-rated Hash House A Go Go.  Hash House is nothing more than a tourist destination that out-of-towners feel they must check off their bucket lists due to the TV time and praise it's received from clueless celebrities visiting Vegas.  However, I bet the celebrities actually GET the service and CORRECT orders without the LONG wait times for their food to arrive.  So yes...go there if you are a celebrity...they may actually take care of you.  Locals know the real deal for breakfast is at Eggworks (or their other locations Eggworks II & The Egg and I) where you avoid the annoying families on vacation happy to overpay for their mediocre meals in exchange for bragging rights of being able to say, \"Hash House A Go Go...Of course I've been there!\"  I've also noticed the weekend-wanna-be-bad-ass biker crowd likes to be \"seen\" at Hash House as well which makes it all that less cool if you ask me.  Eggworks makes my favorite Eggs Benedict of all...The Blacken Prime Rib Benny.  I've had Eggs Benedict with plain ham, exotic ham, salmon, chicken, crab...you name it.  None are as delicious as the one these guys put together with blackened prime rib!  I wish I could find a place in Seattle that would make me a Benny this good!  Be prepared to wait for a table in the mornings on the weekend but be assured that once you are seated, your food will come out fast and fantastic!  I really don't enjoy traditional breakfast foods, but this joint knows how to make EGGCITING breakfasts with a gourmet flare."}
{"text":"The food was epic and the service even better! Manuela knocked it out of the park. There will be a bigger review to come in detail of just how tasty this was!"}
{"text":"Nothing too exciting.. I've been to the other locations and the waiters or waitresses are usually on point. When I came to this one, I felt rushed. We weren't ready to order yet and they kept asking if we were ready. Probably 4-5 times. Towards to end I wasn't even done with my plate yet and the waiter already asked if I was done. The food was good, But the service was ok."}
{"text":"Egg-Works is a great establishment. The food was very good: 10/10 would recommend Michelle as a waitress (we had ten people, all ten agreed she was awesome)"}
{"text":"Manuela is a great server and I hope she gets to go to Disney California. They are the best and we love being able to bring the puppy and sit on the patio for meals. They are a pet friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"It's weird how things happen.   I was reading the reviews about Egg Works on Wed and Thurs as something I really wanted to try on Friday.  I didn't mention it to anyone at work but that's what they decided on doing for Friday lunch.  I was actually impressed.  Real spacious and nicely decorated barn look!? like the entrance to the restrooms.  There's outside dining area, a kinda private room for large groups, a breakfast counter for solo diners, TV's, WIFI.  Service was quick, it wasn't that busy because it was a later lunch.  So it looks like most of their menu were breakfast dishes since it doesn't look to be open for dinner. Most of the dishes looked really good and were large portions. I had the Spinach Benny which was really delicious but didn't care for the sides, a slice of grape fruit and pineapple, with some Works potatoes. Server hooked me up with a pretty good banana muffin which I didn't order.  Someone had the pancakes which seemed a good portion but heard it taste pretty basic. Others had the corn beef hash and some other really good looking breakfast dishes, I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu.  I found a BOGO coupon online at Las Vegas Review Journal website lvrj.com and printed a bunch for our large group.  They said they don't usually honor these printed coupons unless they come straight from the newspaper but they honor it this time.  I'll probably be going to the other locations and see if they'll also honor the coupon or not."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I'm a huge fan of the country Bennie. But My server Karen was absolutely amazing. She had a busy section, was quadruple sat during the time I was there, and she still rocked! Great servers like her are why I keep coming back to eat here. Thank you for the great service!"}
{"text":"Service from Travis was great! Even if they were closing off the section that we were in and moved him to serve other tables, he still provided prompt service."}
{"text":"Eggs works was really good! The service was fantastic and the food was delicious! Our waiter Rob was so kind and astonished us with his hospitality and not to mention he is pretty attractive! Thanks Rob!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I went for breakfast about 2 months ago! We had never been to a Egg Works so wanted to try it out! The restaurant was slammed and we received amazing service from Austin! We sat at the bar and every server was so friendly that walked by! Love this place! Also, food was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the Chile Rellanos omelette is my favorite. Great service and fast. I sat at the counter today and Ashley was personable and quick to get everything I asked for."}
{"text":"Ok so I yelped breakfast places in Henderson and came up with this little gem of a place. Nothing spectacular on the outside but the food was absolutely delicious. I am a biscuit and gravy snob and let me tell you, the biscuit was light and fluffy and the sausage gravy had huge chunks of sausage in it. Not too expensive and the amount of food you get is pretty hefty. If you get a chance to eat at this place I would definitely try it out. Staff was pretty friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We had ALEXA as our server yesterday, very attentive and friendly employee. I hope we get her table again next time we dine in."}
{"text":"The service here is great. I ordered a chicken mushroom and spinach skillet, but after taking a few bites I realized it wasn't my type of plate. I asked the server if he can take it back. The manager came over, apologized, and comp'd my meal along with a whole loaf of their delicious banana nut bread."}
{"text":"We ordered are food at the same time and only one order came out. It was about eight minutes later when a server finally walked by and we asked about the food they said there was a problem with the computer so I asked to speak to the manager. The manager said she would take some off the bill which she did but only $5 and we should have been comped at least the meal we waited 8 minutes for. The service wasn't that great. I was very disappointed in my meal"}
{"text":"First of all food is delicious and our server Melissa is great. She attended to all our needs and service was fast. 5 star for food and service."}
{"text":"This is a breakfast place. The service is fast. The servers are friendly and efficient.  The food is alright. I cannot complain for the price. It's nothing special. It's a place where you can have a quick breakfast and then hit the road."}
{"text":"Tamara was the best!   Great food, great service, friendly staff.  What more can you ask for??"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food!! Unbelievable service!! Great atmosphere!! Huge portions!! Great decision to try a new breakfast spot in Vegas!! I had the New York steak and eggs with potatoes. Awesome recommendation from our server. My girlfriend had a veggie crepe that made me wish I had ordered but with meat. It was that good. There was some sauce that came with it. Not sure what it was, but it was good.  We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Average American breakfast. I have no complaints. Nothing was overwhelming either. Got a good waffle and of course the egg dishes are excellent"}
{"text":"We had brunch and had a great server named Sophie. You have to ask for her when you go. She has an amazing accent. Not to mention she's an awesome server and person.  Great attitude.  Can't wait to go am back again soon.  J Paradise"}
{"text":"My server was Veronica. Excellent service. My coworkers were being indecisive as always, but she stayed patient as ever, even when I was left solo at the table. EXCELLENT SERVICE AND I HOPE SHE GETS THE RECOGNITION SHE DESERVES! =)"}
{"text":"Had the Chile Relleno Omelete with the sauce on the side. It was amazing as was the service by John."}
{"text":"Holy supermarket lighting Batman!  Yowza it's bright in here!  I know, I know, silly that this is my first thought on this delectable dining establishment, but my guest and I turned to each other at the same time upon entering to comment simultaneously on how bright this joint is.   Make no mistake about it, you will not have trouble reading the menu in here.  Moving right along, our famished selves were seated in a prompt fashion and our friendly waitress came to greet us moments after our post butt-in-seats maneuvers.    Our beverage order was taken and filled with a quickness, heaven forbid we wait long for our pot-o-coffee.  My mouth and I were quite pleased with the fresh squeezed OJ, and though the coffee was nothing special at all, just the fact that it was caffeine made me happy at that moment.  A mushroom and Swiss omelet and veggie eggs Benedict order later, we enjoyed discussing the decor while our breakfast orders were prepared.  Farmland murals as far as the eyes could see; hey, it's hard to miss anything in that joint with the light as bright as they are.   I also quite enjoyed their happy or sad faced egg option on the table. What the #$% am I talking about you say? Well, instead of doing that whole pesky walking by to ask if everything is OK you can flip your egg to a happy or sad face based on whether or not you need anything! My antisocial self enjoys that, in fact, I think clothing stores should implement this idea. The days of being asked a million times by every sales associate in the store, \"are you finding everything OK?\" would be over!  Back to Egg Works: the food.  My omelet was covered in cheese, in fact, I'm pretty certain there was more cheese on my omelet than egg. Have no fear, I merely peeled back the cheese layer and enjoyed my eggy/mushroomy omelet underneath. The breakfast potatoes were tasty, a little heavy on the seasoning but a great balance of crisp and softness.  All in all, is Egg Works the most mind-blowing breakfast experience I've ever had, not really. I enjoyed the Cracked Egg a little better, but should I find myself on the West Side of town and craving a tasty breakfast eatery, I would most certainly dine at Egg Works again.  Good eats, great service, those two things all by themselves are 4-stars alone these days!"}
{"text":"If it weren't for yelp I think we would have been stuck at a crappy breakfast buffet. This place was perfect!!!! It was a breakfast person's heaven. The menu was just enormous and I couldn't decide between the prime rib benny and the ultimate omelet but I picked the prime rib benny which was served with seasoned potatoes and it was served on a croissant with eggs, onions, peppers and hollidaise. I also got to taste the banana nut muffin with lived up to the yelp hype. Service here was top notch even though it was packed completely. I would say the only complaint was that the hostess was not a great communicator and I had to ask a few times to figure out when we were gonna be seated...that was minor, please come try it."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, friendly people! The banana nut bread was amazing!! Really close to the freeway."}
{"text":"After trying the sundance special for the very first time, I try so hard to try other items on the menu but I seem to always revert back to my Sundance Special! Love the potatoes and banana nut muffin with my breakfast!"}
{"text":"Old fashion type breakfast bacon eggs toast coffee place.  These are always nice for lazy sundays.  Lots of menu options also which is nice.  Food is super heavy here so bring your wheelchair."}
{"text":"Love the chicken enchilada omelette. Alwayd great service. My kids like watching the train that they have close to the ceiling. Never had a bad dish here....eggs benedict, skillets, island breakfast, banana nut muffins....always good"}
{"text":"Always come here when i have friends in town. Very basic type diner but who cares when the food is great and the service is too. Been here about 5 times and never had a complaint!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was amazing.  The options were endless.  I had the special,  egg whites scrambled with pesto,  fresh mozzarella,  chicken and spinach served with country potatoes and sourdough toast.  My fiance had a skillet that had amazing flavor.... large portions and price was affordable! The ambiance felt nice,  enough space between tables to still have conversation and not listen to those next to you.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Decent assortment of breakfast selections with attentive wait staff. Train track around inside perimeter of the restaurant but no train running while we visited. Checked-in and got a banana nut bread muffin that was delicious."}
{"text":"Raul was a great server. Funny and fast.  Food came out quick and was excellent."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places! We buy the Groupon and go every Sunday! The food comes to the table so quickly and the staff works very hard. Try the Sunrise Mountain with ham. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"First time here. I loved their banana nut muffin! !!! Unfortunately, I didn't like anything else. I ordered the Works Benny that tasted plain and some fruits that weren't even sweet. My husband ordered the Prime Rib Benny but i thought it tasted weird. I'll keep an open mind, though, and try something else next time. ..if I ever decide to go back, that is. Service was okay. Our bill was given to us after 5 minutes of getting our food and after which the lady server said, \"No rush.\" Uhm, okay? I just thought it's not professional, that's all."}
{"text":"First things first: the Cincinnati chili is NOT Cincinnati chili. It's too tomato-y and thick, almost like it was based off of a spaghetti sauce. I'm from Cincinnati and I've been to Camp Washington, Dixie, and grew up on Gold Star and Skyline... This stuff at Egg Works is just wrong.  Second, our waitress, Jennifer, was a dud. She never cleared our over crowded two person table until after our meal and didn't give a crap about whether we were enjoying our food or not. She kept saying she would bring us water, but would forget over an extended amount of time.  I ordered the Country Benny and was not impressed (go to the Cracked Egg for a better version). My companion ordered the Santa Cruz burrito, which looked good, but was not Jessica-friendly (onions galore), so I abstained.  Their shining star was definitely the banana nut muffin, you're missing out if you go and don't order it!"}
{"text":"The service & food here was amazing! My mother, sister & I went here after my sister auditioned for my high school. Our server, Emily, was very enthusiastic, kind, and funny. She didn't ask for us to post a review to help her go to Disney, California, but her service was too great to not do so!! Overall, I recommend this place if you're debating over your daily breakfast/brunch meals!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken fried steak and it was the best I've ever had!  Our waitress Blade was awesome!  We had a party of 8 and she was on top of it."}
{"text":"We've always had good food and service here. Very large portions are a plus as well as it is a great value!"}
{"text":"So, I have lived in Las Vegas for almost 7 years and had never been to Egg Works. Why? Mainly because I don't eat eggs, or sweet stuff, so that crosses out a lot of breakfast type spots. BUT a friend was coming in town, and he wanted breakfast so after looking at the menu, we decided on this spot and I will be back for sure!   Because we went later morning, mid week, we were able to grab a seat at the counter where Heather waited on us. She is super friendly, made some recommendations off of the massive menu and checked back on us enough to feel tended too, but not too much. As my friend and I had tons to catch up on and some times, there is such a thing as too much service. But Heather was perfect!   Our food came up quickly, I had the carnitas crepe and my friend had an omelette. The carnitas were tender and flavorful. The only thing that was missing was that they weren't crispy which would have been a nice balance of textures since the rest of the crepe was soft. The Habla Diablo potatoes were yummy & I got extra fruit since I didn't want a muffin.   My friend's omelette was perfect, he was really happy with his meal too. Coffee was always hot, we never felt rushed. All in all, I will be back!"}
{"text":"We are regulars on the weekends. Enjoy their spicy potatoes and the Panchos scramble. Everything is good ole' comfort food that seems to always be on par."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas!  They have a variety of food on their menu but the best items to order from is their \"Local/Island Menu\" which includes their Portuguese sausage, eggs & rice.  They give you the whole sausage; not just a couple of pieces so it's great! Oh & can't forget their banana nut muffin that comes with the meal (or you can get toast); it is DELICIOUS!! It's freshly baked so it's warm and moist.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cute. Everything is barn themed with egg designs. The servers are friendly and the food comes out quick! And not to mention this place is decently priced. They used to have a lot of coupons in the local vegas magazines so it would make your meals even cheaper!"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite breakfast place!! I come here because they have a Hawaii special- loco moco, Portuguese sausage/spam eggs & rice!! And that's exactly what I order..the Portuguese sausage with eggs and rice. Tastes just like home~  Their banana bread that comes with your meal is my favorite!!! Always warm and fresh out of the oven.   They have a variety of menu options and they are all delicious!   Pricing is affordable and the service is quick.   It does get packed on wknd mornings but the longest wait is 20min or so."}
{"text":"A great place to come in and get a breakfast plate and leave full and satisfied. A group of friends and I came and were all satisfied with the service and taste of the food. Our server was Blade she was knowledgeable about everything on the menu and attentive. All of the employees we encountered here had a great attitude which made this place great. The food was delicious. 3 of my friends ordered country fried steak with eggs. I ordered a chili skillet with eggs and cheese. Girlfriend got a breakfast sandwich on ciabatta bread. Most of the plates here have these seasoned breakfast potatoes which were amazing and full of flavor. There is a reason the LV Review Journal gave this place an excellent rating because it's a great place to eat. Get a mimosa and a banana nut muffin as well. Lastly the value you get here is pretty dam good. For 6 of us we paid about $115 including tip. I think that's pretty good and we still had leftovers. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great omelettes and nice people. They had a lot more food than you'd expect, even lots of non-egg dishes like burritos. Definitely would come again, especially when you can get a free muffin if you check in ;)"}
{"text":"As always, the food was excellent!  The only caveat is to remember to order the potatoes lightly seasoned.  Oh server, Caitlin, was awesome.  She was prompt and friendly and took great care of us.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Its a lunch/breakfast restaurant, soo it is going to be busy on the weekends! But what sucks is they wont take reservations for less than 3 group. But the food has been really good everytime and staff always polite and gives quick service. Great Sunday breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"I brought my family here on a Sunday so I figured the wait would be SUPER long, but only 15 minutes and we were seated. Everything was so fast the way they work together and utilize runners for drinks, etc. We were beyong hungry when we got there so to have our food in about 10 minutes from the time we were seated was really impressive! Plus the food is so satisfying every time. I love Egg Works!"}
{"text":"This brunch place is AMAZING! It had became my number 1 brunch spot. I would come here on a weekly basis if I lived in Vegas and I would LOVE to try everything on their menu. I ordered the Fried Chicken Skillet, and I want to say that it is the BEST brunch I have ever ordered! It was just so flavorful. However the gravy on my chicken had a bit too much sodium. The first few bites was mouthwatering but towards the end the sodium got to me. Nevertheless; everything else was very good and the price was reasonable for what I have ordered. I would love to come back here again if I can. I wished they had this in New York. I have yet to find a good brunch spot in New York."}
{"text":"Great food. Big portion size. The kids love it. I wish they stay a little longer so we can enjoy our brunch later that 3!!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy which is understandable since it is always good! We came on a sundayand we thought there would be a long wait but no we got in quick and our server Donna was awesome, attentive without being  a pest. The gumbalaya was ridiculously good! As always great job Egg Works!"}
{"text":"Service is great but they have their seasoning salt that is just too salty and over powering. Literally ruin the meal.  If they just lightened up I'm sure it would be OK.   This was my second time here also."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas for the weekend - our group of 13 came here twice...everything was great. Donna, our server made our dining experience a memorable one. She provided great recommendations with a smile!"}
{"text":"A must when visiting Vegas. Delicious  Island Favorite is the BEST!!!! Portuguese Sausage rice and eggs!! Worth the 10hour drive. Amanda our waitress was super friendly and didn't miss a thing!!!"}
{"text":"Besides the wait, this place was awesome!  It was hard to choose what to order, but when I saw that they had Cincy chili, I was very happy!  I ordered a 3 way which is Cincy chili over spaghetti with cheese...sooo good!  My sister ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict which she said was delicious.  My daughter ordered the biscuits and gravy, and I actually ate some of it and the gravy was out of this world, definitely the best I have had at a restaurant!  My niece is a vegetarian and ordered the veggie skillet, which she also loved, and it came with their famous banana muffin, we all split it and it was delicious!  This place has something for everyone and everything is quality food in a large quantity served by awesome people that are there to make your visit special!  Loved everything about it, I know why there is always a wait to eat here!"}
{"text":"Donna was very friendly.  Food was amazing.  Try the loco moco and the biscuits and gravy!"}
{"text":"The service I received today was mediocre at best. First I received something I didn't order that my server, Ashley, assumed I ordered, but definitely did not. Then my table had asked for banana nut muffins and she forgot to bring those as well. I normally go to the location further South on Eastern Ave toward Anthem and have never had an issue. The server seemed to have a very lackadaisical attitude about being at work and did not try to please our table. Along with this, the manager on duty apparently wasn't capable of buttoning up her shirt or moving around very much considering she stayed in about the same 5ft of space my entire visit. Just didn't look or act very professional. I will keep my business that the other Henderson Egg Works location considering I have a much better experience."}
{"text":"Great food.  Large portions.  Moderately priced.  Nice decor.  Tasty food.  Convenient location.  Variety of meal options.  Clean bathroom.  The staff are friendly.  Check Groupon because they are always on it for even more meal discount."}
{"text":"Victoria is greatly amazing 1/18/2016!!! Our food was yummy besides the chicken fried steak was a bit salty today."}
{"text":"Ok so I used to be a regular here buuuuuuuttttttt..... Yeah I'm not anymore. Last few times we went here the service was horrible and the food was just as bad.  The country Benny must've changed their recipe or something! Those biscuits are yuck! They seemed under baked then drenched in oil or butter on a flattop! The sausage was just sour and yuck! We didn't eat it but paid for it. Server didn't care that we complained.  The steak and eggs were good as usual.  May be back some time.... Maybe...."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I got their Hawaiian breakfast. It was so good!! The portions are large too. My husband got something with pancakes, sausage and eggs. He liked it, but wasn't blown away. They gave us a banana nut muffin that was amazing. We both loved it. Place was crowded. Service was fast and friendly. We would come again."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good. I liked the newspaper menu :). Our server Donna was friendly and pleasant :)"}
{"text":"Very good traditional breakfast food. Portions are huge. Definitely can split an entree. Good service good prices"}
{"text":"I'm an Egg Works addict! It's Eggs-actly what I want when I think breakfast and when I think eggs!  The menu is the most creative I've seen and I haven't had anything on the menu I don't like! My favorite so far is the Chile Relleno omelette! The Banana Nut muffin comes out warm and scrumptious! The coffee is just like moms and they give you a pot at your table for all the hot coffee you can drink!  The staff is unbelievably fast and friendly! They entire staff is very attentive and professional. The customer service is impeccable.   I wake up craving Egg Works and probably a good thing I don't live closer or I would be there all the time and they would eventually get sick of me & have to kick me out!!!    Egg Works is Egg-ceptional!"}
{"text":"My husband wanted breakfast here. It's titled Egg Works and I expected I don't know fireworks with my eggs maybe... Anyway the eggs are mediocre. They cook everything to order so everything is fresh. However the menu  is huge. You just would assume that they do something unique with the eggs and they don't at all. This place beats IHOP hands down. Home cooking is what you get here. Enough food to feed a small town pilled up on one plate.  Ok I feel a chant coming on are u guys ready...1...2...3! GOOD MEAT GOOD BREAD THANK GOD LETS EAT! hahahahahahah....I give it 4 stars. The bacon was crispy and good. I loved my toast with butter and jelly. They gave me a huge cup of orange juice with ice. I'm in heaven."}
{"text":"We wanted to try something local versus what is on the strip. We yelped and asked around and were led to eggs works. We are glad stopped by!  Donna, our server, was friendly and provided excellent service. Since it was our first time she gave us complementary banana nut muffins that were so moist, warm, and yummy.   It was no easy choice as their menu is full of a lot of dishes to choose from.   We settle on the chile rellenó omelette (4 out of 5 stars as I would sub out the red sauce for a green sauce) and the Mexican omelette 4 stars as it had a little bit more onions than I'd like).   Overall it was very good food!! We'll be back to try the apple pecan pancakes!!!!"}
{"text":"Prelims: a total dinner setting, with the rustic wooden tables and decor, the nice clean look, servers that race around to give you coffee or anything else you need, and a funky little device that if you flip to \"happy\", servers ignore you, but if you flip to \"need service\" multiple servers come racing from all directions to ask how they can help you. Service is great, above and beyond what most places do. And it's also very well known by the locals and very busy all the time, but that shouldn't stop you from visiting! Parking is very open and free, and the menu is a newspaper (very creative :) )  My wife ordered an omelet. I'm not a fan of omelet but when the wife wants eggs, well, a restaurant called \"Egg Works\" should fit the bill. The omelet was actually quite good - very fluffy, very well-stuffed, and accompanied by these delicious little packets of awesomeness called Diablo Potatoes. Essentially, the Diablo potatoes are little bundles of flavor that demons have salted with addictiveness so that you will always come back and feed on them. Just kidding - they're like home fries but with special house seasoning and perfectly roasted. I got a CA crepe, filled with mushrooms, avocados, bacon, swiss cheese. It was very good and enough to feed a small 3rd world country. I only ended up eating half because any more would mean that I would food coma for the rest of the week and I would very much like to be alive during my honeymoon,   All in all, it was very much worth the price, as we ended up sending just north of $20. So totally worth it for a nice brunch or breakfast.   TL;DR Eggs eggs eggs and delicious potatoes."}
{"text":"Egg Works is always delicious!  We waited for awhile on Sunday morning which is to be expected.  I think they could have more outdoor seating, or water availible for guests that are waiting so long.   Once we were seated everything was great! I wish I saved the receipt as our waitress was awesome.   I highly recommend the muffins!"}
{"text":"This is the place for breakfast food. I had a vegetarian crepe that was sensational, The menu is surprisingly vegetarian friendly, which was a huge plus for me!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Great selection of different options for breakfast.  Absolutely enjoy taking the family here for breakfast.  Service is always exceptional."}
{"text":"It was a wonderful experience,we need one in Seattle,I am not a story teller but fore and foremost it was worth a visit"}
{"text":"food was awesome!! and jennifer, our waitress was awesome, has a great, positive attitude!! she was great!! thank you jennifer & egg works!!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and the service isn't the greatest but today that all changed with Victoria. Never knew that you could get a half size omelet or a pancake combo. Those items aren't on the menu. She was very nice and friendly. She made new regulars now. Food was great too!"}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast spot, I've lost track of how many I've been here. Everything I've ever ordered here has been good. Dog friendly, great food, and good customer service...what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Today I went to egg works for the second time. Today was mothers day and they were fairly busy. But that did not stop a single person working from not doing the best job they could! We were greeted as soon as we walked in with nothing but smiles. We only waited a few minutes to be seated and were given drinks right away. After we ordered food it came out very fast, and boy was it good. I got the biscuits and gravy with Diablo potatos and my boyfriend got the French toast! Suzzy was out waitress and came back several times to check on us throughout the meal. She was awesome! It was a wonderful experience and the food was delicious. We will definitely be back to egg works regularly!"}
{"text":"I went in for breakfast ordered the stuffed French  toast I asked for three different items to add on  my food but on my got one so i was charged for something I didn't receive."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. The chili rellano is a must try. Wait time was not long. Our server Maya was great! Thank you."}
{"text":"Food was good, had the country fried steak skillet full size.   They also give you half sizes, the full was more than enough to fill me up and I'm a big eater.  Get the banana nut muffin, it's delicious!!"}
{"text":"Brigette was very sweet and attentive. Even as busy as they were for Sunday brunch, she helped make our experience here a great one. Ask for her when you come in!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast.  Candice, my server, is always warm and cheery.  Couldn't be more helpful or attentive to the customer's needs.  Omelettes are to die for here.  God Bless this place.  Best breakfast place in all of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Our first time going away for breakfast from \"The Strip\", I called in to reserve (best choice) and arrived from Excalibur to parking lot in 15 min and walked right in when there was a line outside. Staff help and attention is incredible! Our server (Amy) handled us quick with drinks plus banana muffins all around, amazing! This place is filled but staff is just coasting thru this, very well trained and team work environment. Also (William) the bus boy is attentive, speedy and very polite.... Just ate, ahh very yummy! The chorizo crepe!! The bacon/avocado omelette!! Chicken fried steak and eggs!! Everything was delicious. We are definitely recommending this place to friends coming to Vegas and WE will return in the near future. Amazing job with customer service, food and taking care of us throughout our breakfast. Great job!!!"}
{"text":"It's our first time to dine here. Excellent for breakfast. Our server named Jennifer is really awesome, she gave us choices on what to have. We are absolutely satisfied. Definitely one of our fave for breakfast."}
{"text":"The country fried steak skillet was perfect hangover food! The banana muffins are amazing"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite breakfast spots in Vegas! I got the country fried steak but substituted toast for biscuits & gravy. The food was so good and our server was awesome! Thanks Yelp for the free banana nut muffin for checking in!"}
{"text":"Best food in town !!! Nicole Ortega was great , very funny , polite .. overall our experience was amazing , will defenitly come back to this restaurant !"}
{"text":"Great food .. Awesome service !! Nicole Ortega is the best , she provided us with excellent costumer care ..!! Definitely be back again ."}
{"text":"5 stars to Nicole ! Great service .. Awesome food .. Endless coffee and flavored creamers , definitively coming back soon , you gotta try the Santa Cruz skillet with sticky rice instead of potatoes .. When you come to the restaurant ask to be seated in Nicole's section , you won't regret it !"}
{"text":"Location on Rainbow/215 area. More than once I have been here, sure they're fast when getting seated but after they seat you they take your drink order and you wait 15mins to get it. Then you're waiting and additional 15mins just to place an order!!!! Maybe I'm just being irrational because I have a two year I need to feed and keep entertained."}

{"text":"I love eating eggworks. Our server was wonderful this morning. The food is similar to home cooking. I would not recommend the sausage links but I would recommend any omelette. There's also a lot of vegetarian options to choose from. This place is also great for a hangover!"}
{"text":"Far superior to Denny's. Gorgeous food in both presentation and taste. Although the place was incredibly crowded, service was immaculate. Amy was very kind, patient and attentive towards me and my Mom. Never left us feeling ignored or unwanted. Amy provided us with wonderful service! Thanks Amy!  Mom ordered a Fiesta skillet. I ordered plain pancakes. All were far and beyond delicious. Everything tasted homemade, starting from my hot chocolate and ending with our order. The pancakes tasted like cake but they weren't obnoxiously sweet-they were done just right.  Will definitely return in the future!"}
{"text":"Candice was our server and is super nice and friendly! I ordered the omelette works and it was very tasty and delicious. Portions here are big! I would recommend anyone to come eat here and most definitely will come back whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and the service was awesome! Asked for fruit instead of potatoes and they gave me oranges, grapefruit, pineapple, 3 different types of melon.. Awesome, helped me to be \"good\" with my breakfast. Asked for iced coffee and they didn't freak.. Thanks Victoria, you're awesome!!"}
{"text":"This morning my family and I  went to eat here for breakfast and Lexie was our waitress, as soon as we sat down she went and asked how we were and what we were having to drink. It's Sunday so my boyfriend asked if she could change the channel to a football game and without hesitation she said yes and went to get the remote. She then got our order and was very fast at getting us out drinks and food came out fast too. She was great overall and will ask for her next time we go."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!!! 5 star restaurant from beginning to end the sweet hostess Ana who greeted us the AMAZING service from Nicole the helpful busser Isidro and the cleanliness of the entire restaurant!! Food came out perfect fast and delicious. Definitely will go back! Thank you Nicole you are the bombdotcom!!!!"}
{"text":"This chain is my go-to place for breakfast while in Vegas, and this particular location didn't disappoint over the weekend. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great Vegas breakfast place.  The food is great, the service is great, and the whole place has personality.  If you're looking to eat breakfast somewhere off of the strip, Egg Works has you covered."}
{"text":"Amazing. Crazy good selection definitely something for everyone. Good prices but come early they fill up fast. Then again quick service with quality food still."}
{"text":"My family and I went there on Saturday, our son loved the pancakes and I really enjoyed the corn beef cash. Not to mention the banana nut muffin was OUT of the world."}
{"text":"My girlfriend ordered the fiesta chicken wrap and instantly got sick to her stomach. I had the last bite of her wrap and got extremely sick within 24 hours of leaving Egg Works.  We've been throwing up non stop since Saturday..  Not sure what was wrong with their meat or what, but one of the produce within her meal gave us food poisoning."}
{"text":"Pretty sure I got a free muffin and HOT DAMN was it worth the 2 minute wait it took to get seated! Muffin was yummers. Benedict was semi yummers. Potatoes were yummers af. I don't have a picture because the second my food was put in my vicinity my animal instincts came out and I carried out my attack.   All in all, I would have paid for that free muffin just bc it was so dang tasty."}
{"text":"Hidden gem on our way to out to Red Rock! From the electric train that was running around the restaurant to the homey decor and egg-cellent food and service by our waitress Nicole, it was a great way to start the day! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I like this place because the food is very, very good and I very much enjoy the free muffin upon check-in #YelpPerks. But I'm giving this place three stars because the services was not the greatest. We had a wait time of about 15 minutes which was normal for this place. When we finally sat down we didn't wait long for drink orders to be taken but we had a VERY small table and an entire carafe of coffee was given to us. I don't mind a carafe but it made eating so uncomfortable. Not to mention that once we fixed our coffees the way we like, we had a small pile of trash (sugar wrappers, etc.) which added to the small space. Some of the creamer spilled onto the table so we used the two napkins we were given to clean it and requested more napkins. It took about 20 minutes for us to get napkins and we got them only because we asked someone other than our waitress. Meanwhile, our waitress was helping the table next to us and not paying much attention to us. I asked if she could take the trash pile and she said sure but walked away LOL. Good food but if I were to go back I would hope that someone else could service us."}
{"text":"Jayne was a great waitress for our party of 16.  Food was fabulous, service was efficient, seating was fast considering we came in during a busy time on Saturday morning.  The best place to go after a hike/scramble at Red Rock Canyon!!!! We left happy & perfectly satisfied!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good here and the portions are great sized. Service is quick, and responsive to the little egg notifier things on the table. Tables are a bit small, but they get the job done for how busy they can get. Servers are a bit touch and go, and perhaps need to know the difference between a screwdriver and a greyhound. As long as it's vodka, I don't care. Lol.  I'd come back, that's for sure. They are really nice people after all~ Thanks, guys!"}
{"text":"Great service. Marc was excellent and attentive. Haole Loco was very tasty. Lots of parking. Lived up to their reputation as Best in Las Vegas. Wish there was one in Los Angeles. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Took some first timers here for breakfast this morning. They loved it and our server, Heather, went above and beyond to make our party of four happy.   I went with my usual, the vegetarian crepe, (see previous review) and it was as good as ever. Very consistent food here. Parents ordered the board special breakfast of the day which was the Florentine omelette and they chose the Mexican omelette from the menu. They were both happy with their meals and they really enjoyed the banana nut muffins that came with the omelettes.   Heather checked back with us several times to make sure all was well. She even checked a few of the condiment caddies from the other tables to find my favorite hot sauce. Nice! She also caught a kitchen error on one of our orders before it reached the table. Three of our plates came out and she told us it would be just another minute on the fourth because it wasn't quite right. Fabulous. We left happy and I'm sure my parents will request a return visit on their next trip."}
{"text":"First time trying this place in Vegas and I must say they had some very yummy breakfast! They have a wide variety of options to choose from that all sound so delicious! They also have vegetarian and vegan options to choose from. The place is a little crowded at the front door entry but once we got passed that all went well. Our waiter was friendly and very attentive to us. I would definitely like to come back to this place when I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"Sorry- but I have to!  I'm a regular here cause it's in my area and the muffins are good. I went here on Saturday, I know it's busy at 8am but there was no reason to wait and watch people walk in way after us and get served their food while we continued to wait(mind u it was just 2 of us).  Today Friday, we went at 9 am and it was somewhat busy With tables open. It kills me when u put 2 people on a tiny table for one. Food was good as always but sever was a bit shaky as he didn't know where the green Tabasco was. SMH WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS LOCATION?  ITS NOT THE SAME AND AS MUCH AS I LIKE THIS PLACE I WILL BE BACK, I'll jus take the counter next visit."}
{"text":"Although our server was mostly absent. Our food was great! They have a beautiful patio area. The coffee was fresh. We had  shirt wait just because we asked for patio seating. Nevertheless we had a great experience and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"There's places where I want a table, and then there's places where you sit at the counter. This is definitely the latter.  As I sat down, I noticed the sign above the toasters: \"You don't have to be crazy to work here. We train you.\"  And I instantly fell in love with this place.  The food, while excellent, is almost secondary to me to the controlled chaos in the serving area.  One gentleman with complete control of dishes exiting the kitchen. While servers, including Shantel, my server, seamlessly flowing in a narrow space.  Definitely not something I could pull off. Yet they all made it look so easy.  I hope to get back here again."}
{"text":"Delicious best breakfast in town don't let any one tell you other wise I come here at least 2-3 times a week. Great service and fast when your in a rush thx again"}
{"text":"I really liked the food but the reason why I will come back is because of Thaynara she is such a sweat heart and a great server."}
{"text":"Tina is the best! She was wonderful, attentive, and accommodating. The food is amazing for the price, and the service is quick. I would highly recommend to anyone visiting the area!"}
{"text":"We love egg works, they banana but muffins are the best !  I never had anything here I didn't like Donna was our server this morning and she  was very attentive. Hope u enjoy ur vacation Donna !! Don't worry work be here when u get back   It's easier to get a table during the week but weekend this place is packed, just a FYI"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place. Staff here is great. We've been to every location in town now. This is the closest to our home. This location also has a brick oven and a separate menu just for it. Haven't ordered anything off that menu but looks good!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the staff (Jay is the man!) and the quality of the food - the veggie benny I had was delicious! I definitely plan to come back :-)"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for over 10 years and I finally made it to Egg Works.  Had a lovely breakfast and the corned beef hash was DELICIOUS!!  Get it with tomatoes (like I did) or something other than the potatoes.  The hash has potatoes already.    Our server was DONNA and she was a delight!!  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Veggie omelet, banana nut muffin, and their onion ring sauce is so good. Overall great place to have brunch with your family. The service is really friendly and the food is so good. The wait for the food is never too long, and the pricing is excellent! A staple when I come to visit."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is great !!! The wait staff is incredible. They are super nice and fast. This place is super popular and there is a good reason why. The food is great and the people are friendly. Yes, yes, and yes again"}
{"text":"My wife and I had breakfast on January 1. The food and service were perfect. Plenty of food at a reasonable price.  Special thanks to our waitress, Maya. She is efficient, friendly and helpful. Kudos to Maya."}
{"text":"Overcooked rubber omelette. Could not follow my request for no potatoes and the wrong toast. It took so long to get the food it was not worth sending back. Honestly, one should not require a knife because your fork alone cannot sever a bite from the rubberized disk of eggs to eat them. My husband did not fare better for the entire day due to grassiness of his skillet. We were unable to eat for the rest of the day due gastric distress. This place used to be a favorite of ours in town. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Shhhhhh... don't tell mum, I have found a place that makes the best seasoned fried potatoes and finishes it with the most delicious homemade banana nut muffin.   The wife and I have been coming to Egg Works for years. The Brad's scramble is usually my go to meal but today I tried the carrot cake French toast and the wife had an Eggs-ceptional fresh veggie omelette. The omelettes are prepared with four large eggs, sand come with Hablo Diablo seasoned potatoes and toast or the mouth watering divine banana nut muffin. The veggie omelette is made with diced onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, green bell peppers and fresh spinach, topped with cheddar and jack cheeses.   Gotta love the cute egg decorations and the metal egg flipper on each table to let your server know if you are happy or need service.  Sprinkle some hot sauce on the omelette and a little ketchup for the potatoes and prepare yourself for meal you won't soon forget 5/5!  The carrot cake French toast was good but very dense, it was served with warm apple compote and maple syrup 3.5/5. Personally I prefer more fluffy French toast but I did see many people trying it. Will be back next time for an omelette for sure.  Enjoy the pics and give an omelette a try with the best seasoned fried potatoes ever!  **PS Yelp check in offer: Free Banana Nut Muffin! Take it to go and enjoy it later."}
{"text":"Upon walking into Egg Works, it looks and feels like any other diner. Once you take your seat and they hand you their menu which is a newspaper, you know that it's not quite ordinary. Once you get a chance to look around it has a whimsical country  farm feel that centers around eggs. Stuffed chickens and roosters here and there. Egg Works themed coffee cups and even when you need help, there's a egg sign you flip that has a sad face meaning that you need your waitress to help you with something. We never actually had to use it since the service was really friendly and great. They treat you like you've been there before after ordering. A nice 'down home' feel. One of the quirkier things is that the door to the bathrooms is built to look like an outhouse.  I just ordered the Bacon and Eggs (what else?). It was a huge plate that additionally came with potatoes (the herby fried square kind). The eggs were fluffy and took up a large portion of the plate. The bacon was nice and crisp, but not overly so. Overall, it was so much that I couldn't finish it off. We also had the Vegetarian Greek Omelet.  I love feta cheese and never thought to mix it with eggs. It came out really tangy. Besides eggs, what is the next best thing? Four words: Homemade Banana Nut Muffins. I could just come here to eat these all by themselves. I'm not a muffin guy, but these dark pillowy muffins make my mouth water.   A couple last things: The prices are really good for the amount and quality of food you get. No complaints here at all. The parking lot is fairly large, but I could see this place being really busy. When we went it was more toward afternoon, so the crowds dispersed by then. It's a place that's high on our list of places to revisit on our next trip."}
{"text":"huge portions, great food, & great service! we went on 4th of July & it was super busy but only had to wait 5min for our table & food came out pretty quickly as well. carla was our server & she was very friendly & did a great job"}
{"text":"Great tasting food. Quick service. Nice atmosphere. It's my new favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Are you a fan of Egg and I on Sahara?  Then this is the same place with a slightly different name.  In fact, it's the same newspaper menu too.  The difference between Egg and I and this place, so far, is no wait.  Usually when I head to the Sahara location, I have to wait.  I will come over here from now on."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Always great service, food comes out fast, and it's delicious. I recommend the Santa Cruz Breakfast Burrito."}
{"text":"Waiter was hilarious (Ray?) and offered suggestions. I got buttermilk pancakes with turkey bacon and scrambled eggs. The pancakes were fluffy and the turkey bacon was smoky, but they weren't anything spectacular.   The orange juice tasted like it was homemade. It was very delicious.   2 other people got corned beef hash (mashed potatoes, corned beef, eggs, side of hash) and they gobble it up. My sister got Portuguese sausage with eggs and sticky rice and raved about it."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful! The food was good but what I really loved was the service. And I got my delicious free banana muffin for checking in! Yum!"}
{"text":"Good traditional breakfast place in the Henderson, Anthem area. Get here early on the weekends because they are always busy! The atmosphere is very \"green acres\" which can be a little strange at first! If you can get past the funky farm murals, the food exceeds expectations."}
{"text":"Visiting from Oregon this place was fantastic. I would totally go back. Service was great. The server was fast and very friendly. The food was yummy and plentiful. You could eat as healthy or unhealthy as you choose for a general perspective. Really close to the airport but that's only about 10 Minutes from the strip soooo.... considering traveling half that distance in some southern Oregon towns takes 4 times as long...  it's not that bad at all."}
{"text":"The food was delicious especially the pancakes. Prices were great. The drinks were amazing and the waitress was awesome. I would definitely recommend this to locals and tourists."}
{"text":"The waitstaff and the service was great...the food...not so spectacular.  Wife had the Works Spinach Benny and I had the Traditional Benny. We skimmed over the part where they say they SMOTHER the Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise Sauce. To them, SMOTHERING means that the English Muffin is a soggy mess instead of being a toasty contrast to the sauce and the eggs.  The Habla Diablo Potatoes were more salt than heat. If we are in the neighborhood again, we'll go back...certainly not our next 'go-to' place."}
{"text":"We just discovered this place last weekend.  Incredible menu with pretty much every breakfast possibility.  Extra points for having Loco Moco and spam...extra extra points for making it perfectly.  The waitstaff is attentive and they have this really innovative thing on the table where if you need service, you flip this cardboard cut-out of an egg over and they can see that you need something.  Good food, reasonable prices, clean, friendly...we'll be back."}
{"text":"Crikey! We've got a screamer here but not as entertaining as Gordon Ramsey. Don't sit at the counter unless you want to hear this little spitfire lady scream out every 2 minutes: \"I need a runner here!\"   Oh boy, I NEED AN ASPIRIN.  I might have put up with the clucking of the loud obnoxious lead waitress at the pass screaming out for service had the food been at least worth it. My waitress was very sweet and helpful in describing what's good to eat. She was pushing the hash as the best thing on the menu. I decided to play it safe with a cheese omelet. I struck out on this one. The omelet was rubbery and the potatoes were greasy which really did a number on me a few hours later. I don't know what they put in the potatoes but they had a rancid taste and the slight smell and taste of vinegar. The portions are ridiculousness huge but considering the double wide waste lines of the patrons in this joint, I can see why the customers don't complain.   Another reason not to sit at the counter: the absolutely most disgusting thing I have read in a restaurant or for that matter read anywhere in public, except maybe in a doctors exam room, was pasted on the wall right in front of me at the lunch counter.   Are you ready? Wait...if you are eating and reading put your fork down now. Fair warning....here it comes: (Remember I didn't get that warning as I was eating my rubber omelet). When you sit at a lunch counter, it's normal to glance around and stare directly ahead of you. My attention was drawn to a cheeky sign that read \"Will trade coffee for gossip\". Ok, that's typical coffee house cute. That's not the bad part. Below this sign there is a typed notice from management to the employees on when it is acceptable for an employee to be excused from coming to work: There are five reasons and I only got to read up to # 2 before I lost my appetite reading about projectile bodily functions. The sign says something to the affect that in order to protect the health of the other workers and patrons, the following reasons are acceptable accuses for not coming to work. They are: 1: Vomiting. 2: Diarrhea, 3: who knows what the rest said. Bleh!   So there I sat with little miss spitfire hollering out for service on my right, I got the busboy on my left drying all the flatware and clanging them into containers while giving me the stink eye every so often. I've got this sign in front of me that I should have taken as a warning for my afternoon discomfort to come! Earlier, the waitress offered to give me a sampling of the hash, which thankfully she forget to bring. I pushed the rubber egg aside, grabbed the check and headed to the cashier. When the cashier asked me if everything was alright, I asked her if she thought that was appropriate to post that sign at the lunch counter for customers to read. She was grossed out as much as I was and said she would talk to management. Not an entirely pleasant breakfast experience at Egg Works.  My stomach is still churning from the obnoxious breakfast and the sound of the waitress screaming \"I need a runner here!\" is still in my head. Oye!"}
{"text":"This is my new breakfast joint in VEGAS. It was my second time here and am still satisfies with the great food and customer service. Make sure you check in on yelp for the free banana nut muffin. It is Deeelicious!!! Groupon also has a great coupon for this place. Hopefully by the time you see this it will still be available."}
{"text":"Tely is the best server in this place! She's personable, easy on the eyes, her regulars love her, and it seems that she loves her job. The food is great and they give you large portions. If only Bite Squad delivered for them, Egg Works would be perfect!  I enjoy going in for Sunday football (as long as people don't change the channel I'm watching). :-) Egg Works is definitely worth checking out. Make sure to let Tely know that Jeremy sent you. :-)"}
{"text":"I love coming here! My niece wanted cereal and it blew her mind she was able to set it up and pour it herself. Candice was fantastic and despite being busy was very quick to help us when needed. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great food and a really good menu! The skillets are amazing as is the omelets..The place gets pretty crowded from time to time..."}
{"text":"Heather was a great server to start off, very upbeat and enjoyable. I had myself waffle works and my boyfriend got the island favorite which we were reAlly happy to see they had because it's served with rice and Portuguese sausage. It made me smile when heather offered us soysauce. Haha. I hope she gets to go to Disney land. By the way, the portions are worth their price! The waffle and eggs was so much better here compared to The Broken Yolk."}
{"text":"I had hopes for this restaurant. I just ordered an eggs benedict to go, but the duration of my 30 minutes there was less than pleasant.. The hostess gave me a negative vibe from the moment I walked in and told her I was picking up an order. No smiles from her, just a \"go to the back bar.\" While I was waiting to cash out, there was, understandably, a line. The hostess walked over and in quite a loud voice told us to move the line to the other side of the lobby. There was no, \"excuse me, would you mind if...\" Or a \"please\" at the end of her command. The girl at the register had no smiles either. I understand it was busy and you might be at the end of your rope, but you work in the service industry. I was a hostess for two and a half years and I always had a smile on my face, even at the end of a shift, or after a difficult guest, because working at the front of a restaurant means you are the first and last impression of it. The only pleasant person I met was the older gentleman standing in front of me in line that I struck up a conversation with."}
{"text":"I had a 10 minute wait for breakfast (it was Sunday after all!) but the meal came extremely quickly.  Even with the speed. My Traditional Benny was excellent.    Server Veronica (enjoy your trip to Disneyland, Veronica) was efficient and helpful with my meal.    All in all an excellent breakfast stop!"}
{"text":"If you're hungover, don't go to some stupid fast food joint. Go to Egg Works. I've had food at both locations, and am never disappointed. Get the Works Veggie Benny. It is amazeballs. Edit OH GOD THE BANANA NUT MUFFIN. SO GOOD YOU'LL CRY."}
{"text":"The food was way too salty. Service was not all that great since ahe kept forgetting what we had asked for. Had to ask other servers to get it. Also pretty chilly inside for a cool day outside. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Best seasoned potatoes and the banana nut bread is so delicious! The crepes were massive, they were practically omelets."}
{"text":"This was my favorite breakfast in Vegas.  Nothing compared to it.  It is worth the trip off the strip.  Cheap, good food.  The servers are friendly.  They have a happy, sad egg sign that you turn over when you need attention from your waiter.  It has a very warm atomosphere."}
{"text":"Everything's delicious!! Classic breakfast food destination in Vegas, great omelettes and potatoes, hollandaise sauce is delish, and I've never had bad food here ever! Creative omelettes that are awesome and they even make a veggie omelette taste good/not boring! Love."}
{"text":"Staff is amazing! We went on a Sunday which normally all breakfast places are packed and we thought the wait was going to be long but we only waited at the most 10 mins. Our server was Marianne and she was such a sweet heart! You can tell she enjoys her job, she was kind and smiled the entire time. Whenever we needed assistance she was there as quick as possible. Which was amazing, specially since it was busy. The food was amazing and the coffee creamer options are delicious. Love coming here! And Marianne made the experience that much better! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Free muffins! Good works complete and this habla diable tastes yummy to give some slight heat."}
{"text":"Wife and I tried this place out.   Service was top notch. Quickly got seated and was taken care of the whole time.   My issue with the place was the food. I ordered the works and my wife ordered the grilled cheese. The food is very very oily. Both my wife and I had a stomach ache after words.  They need to cut down on the oil and cheese and this place will be a 5 star spot for me."}
{"text":"This place is just a great place for breakfast or brunch. Always crowded but the service is great and the wait time is minimal for all the people they serve...love them!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fabulous service! I lived in the south for awhile and these biscuits & gravy are the real deal :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Friendly service. Best breakfast on our end of town.  So glad this restaurant is here - we go every weekend it is so good!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  We are visiting Vegas a d have been doing a lot of hiking. We were very hungry this morning and wanted a warm protein breakfast. This is the place. Our Chili Relleno and Bacon Avocado omelettes were  delicious. Too much for us but what a wonderful breakfast. The wait staff was wonderful and the manager also came around to check on our service and food. Wonderful menu selection. They make it all!"}
{"text":"I came to eggs and I on a Sunday morning. Their staff was very attentive and my meal which was a Florentine eggs Benedict was cooked perfectly. Our coffee and water cups were constantly refilled and our waitress was very friendly. However I wasn't very fond of the endless country music they played. Overall they serve a delicious breakfast at a very reasonable price. I will definitely come back and bring my dogs with me next time since they have a dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"I ordered a MASHED POTATO OMELET here... yes... mashed potatoes!!! It was sooooo good! As soon as I saw that on the menu, I knew that was the one I was ordering. I have never seen it on a menu before and I was very curious how it was going to taste. It was absolutely delicious... If you love mashed potatoes as much as I do, you will not be sorry. The place doesnt look like much, it is a little small but almost completely full of hungry, hungry people. We were seated immediately, we went on a friday morning. The service was very friendly, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. My friend ordered the banana nut french toast and it came with a side of eggs. When they brought our food out, they came back with an extra side of eggs because they werent sure if hers got cold while they were preparing the rest. AWESOME! We felt like we were really taken care of. On top of the amazing food. a total win. I love this place and can't wait to go back! In total, spent a little over $20 for the mashed potato omelet, french toast combo and a glass of OJ."}
{"text":"This is total hangover breakfast place, very indulgent and large portion sizes. The service was great, they have this cute system where you flip something over on your table and we tried it and we're helped immediately. We weren't hungover but still enjoyed the veggie skillet which they let us add bacon to. Also we were definitely those annoying people that stayed for a really long time and no one gave us a hard time about it, which we really appreciated since we had a lot to catch up on. All in all I'd definitely recommend this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Had breakfast yesterday and I must say I that it was an enjoyable atmosphere.  PK was the friendliest waiter I've ever had.  It seems like many of the regulars knew him and he acknowledged and greeted many customers, even if they were not in his station.  It's nice to see that kind of customer interaction.  Because of him (and the food, which was excellent by the way) I will be back."}
{"text":"Like that that will modify your order to be a little Less calorie dense. Turkey bacon, cottage cheese, egg whites etc. get the groupon"}
{"text":"Just looking at the menu it is so cute. The menu is like reading the morning news paper. However HUGE TIP- give yourselves at least 20 min to read the ENORMOUS menu. To tell you the truth it is a little overwhelming. I'm not even an egg person but I love the selection and variety they have here: to start off- classic eggs served any style, 5 types of egg Benny's, tons of specials with eggs served with the whole bandit of muffins, toast, crossionts- along with the savory toppings and sides of cheese, grilled onions with a side a bacon, ham or sausage, or steak. 20 different types of omelettes with every topping you can think of including the works or the sun dance special- spinach, sliced mushrooms, artichoke hearts, Swiss cheese? Topped with feta and fresh tomatoes. And to keep going (just onto page 2)- 5 different kinds of scrambled, 9 skillet breakfasts, 6 crepes and even my favorite the Hawaiian breakfast section with 2 types of loco moco and the island favorite of spam or Portuguese sausage and eggs plus rice. On top of all of this I didn't even mention the totasta eggs along with the 20 different burritos (ok may not have been 20) but a lot of burritos with eggs included of course. And of course they have a no eggs section of pancakes, waffles, and French toast/ parfaits options; also soups, salads, wraps, and sandwiches and lastly chilli (Cincinnati style-not sure what that even means!)  Also if u wanna get your drink on (I mean it is Vegas) they have vodka red bull, mimosa, greyhounds, screwdrivers, and classic vodka cranberry. As well as beers. Too bad they didn't offer an unlimited drink options! That would make this place amazing for brunch!  This place is average on price; 10-13$ for breakfast/brunch. But from what it seems the portions are large! Also I forgot to add they have a brick oven menu with an array of stombolis, brick over sandwiches and of course pizza.  We ordered the corn beef hash with white toast and 2 scrambled eggs, the omelette chili reyenos, and enchilada burrito"}
{"text":"Now this is a true one of a kind restaurant that specializes in EGGS and BREAKFAST. The menu is 8-pages long so if eggs are \"not\" your thing you WILL find something to tempt your tastebuds!!! As soon as we arrived, Chris was right there with coffee and a FREE warm banana nut muffin. We said we would share and his response was that once we tasted it, there would be no sharing.  And wow.  There is no doubt it is the best banana nut muffin I ever had. Did I say WOW?? I had the homemade corn beef hash.  WOW. And my husband had the Loco Moco. I am stuffed.  I can't eat another bite.  I may not eat again for 2 days!!! Lol. Seriously loved every bite. And Chris has the best hospitality skills I have seen in a long time!!! Being a Southwest flight attendant I know hospitality!!  If I ever own my own business, I am coming to steal Chris away!!! And you can have your extra muffin to go if you do not want toast!  And he offered us a cup of coffee to go!!! EGGS-TRAORDINARY!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and service. The server Alexa was great and on top of things for us. You definitely won't leave here on an empty stomach. Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Service was great!  Food great as well. Ken in particular was extremely helpful with picking new items to try. Great breakfast/brunch spot, and even though it's crowded, the wait isn't too trifling."}
{"text":"Very busy, but the food is worth it. Only open in the morning until 3 in the afternoon I think. But I love their Egg Works potato wedges."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast with my niece. The hostesses and the waitress that we had were all very friendly and nice. I ordered the French toast and the diablo potatoes and ordered the moose pancakes for my niece. I wanted a banana nut muffin to go and the waitress gave it to me on the house. Very good food, very nice people, I will be back."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar on a busy Sunday morning and Shantel had the greatest attitude and awesome recommendations! I highly recommend this place if you have nothing planned after so that you can take a nap after the huge, delicious portions."}
{"text":"As always, great food. Excellent service from Michelle. Hot fresh coffee immediately served. Had the works skillet. Potatoes are the best. Most impressed by perfectly cooked over easy eggs. So many places under cook & serve raw & \"snotty\". Please consider opening near Aliante area."}
{"text":"This review is based strictly on the food and not the restaurant or quality of service, which were both good.  I ordered a breakfast burrito with seasoned potatoes as the side.  When the burrito arrived it was drenched in sauce.  It was so bad that it broke apart constantly whenever I cut into it.  In my opinion, based on having many breakfast burritos at different places, a burrito should be held or at the very least shouldn't break apart so easily when cut into smaller pieces.  This was so bad that I was using my spoon and eating like a regular meal.  \"Maybe you should've asked for the sauce on the side\" could be a rebuttal to this review.  Perhaps, but keep in mind this was my first time here.  I had no idea it would be drenched.  To add insult to injury, the water we were served had a bad after taste which leads me to believe that they don't serve filtered water like the majority of places do.  I might be back, but for sure it will be for a regular breakfast next time."}
{"text":"There were a lot of people waiting so we figured maybe it was worth the wait. Staff was great, food even better. The prices are good and the service is top notch."}
{"text":"Very similar to Mr. Mamas,  but I enjoyed Egg Works much better.  It could have been the banana nut muffin that made me enjoyed egg works.  Very solid choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great local breakfast spot.  This location has a nice patio and friendly staff.  Good kids menu and tons of options.  One meal not on the menu, but you can order is the pancake  Works with 2 pancakes, 2 eggs and meat."}
{"text":"Eggcellent! Had breakfast and my server was Nichole. She was awesome, great attitude and better service. I will request her when I come back."}
{"text":"Wrapping up a week of vacation with the yummy corned beef hash and a mimosa! And the amazing banana nut muffin! Our server, Maria Marlene, was very attentive and so sweet! Great start to the day!"}
{"text":"Such a good spot for brunch! So many choices and the portions are large! You got everything you could want for brunch here: bennys, omelettes, country fried steak, pancakes, waffles, toast, & gumbo-laya. Most of the dishes come with a choice of their banana muffin so don't even hesitate!! THE MUFFINS ARE SO GOOD, MOIST WITH A CHOCOLATEY EDGE TO IT. And bottomless coffee for the table if you opt for coffee! Hazelnut and French vanilla non-dairy creamers are at the table. Their diablo potatoes were nice and crispy on the outside, just the seasoning could be a tad salty if you don't eat it with ketchup.   Don't forget to check-in for your free banana muffin!!"}
{"text":"The best place to go if you want that comforting, feel good breakfast!   My family and I just landed in Vegas and we wanted something wholesome to eat. Egg Works was the first thing that popped up so we have it a go!   They will give you a free banana nut muffin when you check in under yelp. There was 3 of us and the wait was a little over 30 minutes (it was also a busy Friday morning). Prices are medium priced but portions are big (to me they were) so you'll get your moneys worth.   Food was awesome, delicious and at the same time so simple! Something we needed after a 5 hour flight from Hawaii. We ordered the waffle works (Belgium waffle, scrambled eggs, and choice of meat), loco moco (popular dish from Hawaii with steamed rice, hamburger patty, smothered in gravy and topped with eggs), and oatmeal w/ bowl of fruit and side of toast and avocado.   Service was great! Despite that day being super busy, our waitress kept everything in top notch!    I definitely recommend locals or tourist to come here. I know I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"What can i say break fast andbhot ass servers...  Price docked you a star.  Way too pricey for eggs and bacon."}
{"text":"The food quality is average, the portions are large, and the service was on point. My friend and I went in for lunch and it was SUPER busy, which usually is a good sign. We were seated only with a short wait but the wait for our food took a pretty long time. It didn't really bother us, as it was expected, but the server brought our check and said goodbye before we were even half way done with our food. She told us not to rush, and we're looking at each other like, uhhh, we wont. You took your time bringing us the food and we are going to take our time eating it. She had the tuna which was pretty bland so she had to add some hot sauce to it. Our fries were tiny which we weren't really a fan of, either. But my cheeseburger was pretty good."}
{"text":"Our first time at Egg Works on a Sunday morning. They were very busy so we opted for the counter area..excellent choice for us.  Why?  No wait, and if you enjoy watching a well choreography establishment, those are the seats. Impressive team work between kitchen staff and servers.    Their paper menu reads like a news paper so their menu variety is huge. I should've asked for more time to mull over the menu...They offer from just eggs to oven baked pizza to jambalaya bowl.....but we had the loco moco and the country fried steak. Both were delicious and are big portions.  Their famous banana muffin was tasty but was very sticky to the fingers, a bus person saw me struggling to wipe my sticky fingers and give me extra napkins without me needing to ask.    Overall, we felt Egg Works has a comfortable atmosphere, great food and service....no surprise it's a local favorite.  We will be back"}
{"text":"First time here..Food was awesome! TRAVIS was really attentive & great! *he should go to Disney! ;) we will def be back!   We ordered the strawberry cream cheese French toast & chili relleno omelette. Both delish.. But Chili Relleno was our fav!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast choice in Summerlin, they open early (0600) and do a pretty steady business. Snobberlin's pampered pooches enjoy the patio, and their people seem to dig the food if the crowds are any indicator.   Servers are quite friendly and on top of their tables, though occasionally when it is busy you might wait a few minutes for a refill of water, coffee is provided by the jug. The \"happy\" or \"sad\" egg signs work to remedy  hiccups pretty swiftly.   Typical breakfast fare with seasonal specials thrown into the mix in a location close to the gym, where you can absolutely dine in workout gear is a plus. Friends are fans of the bottomless cups of Joe, pancakes, French Toast and hash browns, while I usually stick stick to building my own omelette or a crepe. Something for everyone, at a modest price served up in a non Big Box chain location to boot = a fan!  * they do serve lunch, but I've not tried it. Heard good things about the salads  . Open daily till 3PM *  * they are quite accommodating of substitutions *"}
{"text":"Robert was an awesome server! Prompt, friendly and easy on the eyes. Food was good and atmosphere was upbeat."}
{"text":"Great service, great food horrible parking base on how awesome this place is for brunch."}
{"text":"Yelp says they do not allow dogs which is causing them to miss out on a lot of people in the dog community who are not aware that this restaurant offers dog friendly dining. I brought my dogs here several times. The servers are always very friendly but not as attentive as they could be and lack attention to detail. I've experienced this with a few different servers. Such as never being checked back on after I get my food. Never. And me never having a napkin throughout my entire dining experience because  no one anticipated that I would need one initially, or checked on me until I was finished eating . Also leaving me there way too long to accept my money. I felt uncomfortable leaving money sitting on the patio, I eventually did. The food is decent but often cold and I don't have an opportunity to do anything about it because no one ever checks on me so I end up eating cold food. I have experienced this indoors as well. Their famous potatoes aren't that great and they are usually cold."}
{"text":"A cozy family friendly breakfast spot. Reasonably prices and excellent food. Banana nut muffins are delicious. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty good food just average huge portions!! worth going maybe during the weekdays for breakfast meetings except weekends are horrid very busy and patrons allow kids to scream and yell when politely asked them to stop the child so we could enjoy our meal they said f... You. Management was at the next booth and I'm sure heard it all as she was looking at me said nothing ..... I sure didn't appreciate the cussing in front if my kids.... Probably wouldn't go back unless was the only option ..... Management should have more control of the chaos"}
{"text":"Great breakfast at a low price! Checked in and received my amazing muffin and then had the prime rib Benedict and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great for breakfast or brunch and they even have a menu for pizza, calzones, burgers and all that jazz!  This is my second time trying this place and the plates I've gotten are amazing. Eggs are cooked to perfection, food is cooked thoroughly, toast is perfectly crispy and their banana muffin if off the walls!   This isn't an extremely big restaurant but I would say it is worth the wait (20 minutes or so?) staff was very nice and service was great! You have these metal eggs on the table and if you need service, you flip it over and someone will come to assist you!"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far and service was GREAT!!! We also had the same server \"Randi\" excellent waitress... Banana Nut muffin is oh so delicious... We tried \"The 3 Pig\", \"The Works\" and the \"Chicken Enchilada\" omelette ALL so good with BIG portions... Definitely coming back for more.."}
{"text":"I debated giving Egg Works 3/5 because the food was just ok but the service was good, especially since we were a large party and split checks were no problem! The waitress was very nice, I believe her name was Diana. As for the food, I had the Sundance Omelette. The omelette was tasty and had a good portion of ingredients including spinach, tomato, artichokes and feta cheese. My only qualm with the omelette was that the egg was cooked well and came out hard on the outside vs soft and fluffy. The coffee was of average quality. I like that they leave the coffee pot at the table for you for instant refills. I substituted the potatoes for fresh fruit on the plate and I got a nice assortment of melons (3 kinds), pineapple, and grapefruit. Good little place for breakfast. The free banana nut muffin with Yelp check-in was a nice bonus!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat the food. Visited from La and I hate commercial restaurants and was looking for a moms and pops place. The food here is so generic and doesn't taste fake. I will be back to this place next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I live this location of Egg Works. Been to them all including The Egg and I's, and this location has the best servers and good. The whole place is clean, including restrooms. They have quality food, seems a little fresher then most locations. The server PK is great. He is quick with his service and fun and easy to talk to. Trevor is another great sever/manager at this location. The daily changing food specials are also really good. I get a lot of different things but my old stand by is the mashed potato omelette. It's killer!!"}
{"text":"my first time here and i will come back.  the first impression is always what will get the customer to come back or not.  shout out to p.k. our awesome islander waiter. *he thought i was from the island too lol  this guys is amazing, he had a smile on his face, cracking up jokes, making me feel comfortable and was right on the ball with his customer service. very friendly!  food: i ordered the island favorite with portugese sausage, eggs and rice with the banana nut muffin. *always get the muffin, it is the best and moist muffin ever.  i will come back again! good job eggworks!"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for the first time since it is down the street from where I live. This definitely won't be my last! Even though it had the normal business for a breakfast crowd, my server Joshua was attentive to my needs.  I ordered the Sundance special with seasoned chicken. It was very yummy. There was a nice amount of artichoke hearts which is usually a lacking ingredient at other places. The potatoes were nicely seasoned and the banana muffin was moist. All the food was brought out quickly and correctly. Joshua always came back to make sure that my table had everything that we needed. If only every waiter was like him!"}
{"text":"Candice was great!  The food we had was ok banana nut muffin good..Good casual place to visit.."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place. The chili rellano omelet is amazing. Very good pricing too. I highly recommend it definitely a great spot for a great sunday breakfast. :) The servers always seem to be nice as well which is a great way to start the morning."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Love the banana nut muffin and choice of omelettes. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"The food was great from the banana muffins to the Diablo potatoes. Our server Laura was very attentive and the manager Bruce was amazing.  I will definitely go there again when I'm in Vegas. Maybe they will open one in San Diego."}
{"text":"Had a delicious breakfast of traditional  bennys.   Our server was Suzy. She was the best, very fast and helpful and kind. Had a great experience. Also got my free banana nut muffin which is great. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times in the past and I've never had a bad experience. My boyfriend and I went here for brunch on Valentine's Day. We were seated immediately. The service was fantastic and our food came pretty quickly. This restaurant is very clean and has great food. I highly recommend this place for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"First time to check-in yesterday (Thursday, 10/06/17) and certainly not the last. Friendly, courteous service. Highly recommended!  I ordered the Fresh Veggie Skillet. Onion, tomato, bell pepper, sliced mushrooms, fresh spinach, and cheddar & jack cheese. Side of seasoned potatoes. (Good for 2-3 servings. Really!) A dash of Chohula kicks it up a notch!  The coffee was robust and smooth. Bonus points for free muffins served melt-in-your-mouth warm.  Next time you're in Las Vegas and you're looking for a place for brunch, with courteous staff and reasonably priced meal choices, go to Egg Works at 2490 E Sunset Road. Look for Olivia. She provides excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Before I forget her name: look for Blade! Awesome service. Fast & friendly.  Got a FREE banana nut muffin. Thank you, Yelp check in.  Ordered the $9.50 ISLAND FAVORITE with Portuguese Sausage and two eggs any style, and sticky white rice. Chose banana nut muffin (so I had one dine-in and another one to-go).  Used a $12 Groupon deal (to cover $20 meal). I had a friend with me who ordered the  biscuits & gravy.  Between the two of us, I only added less than $10 to cover the bill. And left $5 tip.  This is my first visit to Egg Works on W Flamingo Road and it won't be the last. I visited Egg Works on E Sunset Road and had a satisfying dining experience there, too!"}
{"text":"Wow. Not what we expected. We went to Egg Works this morning for the first time, hoping for a good breakfast. The place was full of people, so we were optimistic.  My wife ordered egg whites, with home fries and a banana nut muffin. I ordered Grandma's  Sausage Gravy and Biscuits, with the home fries. That was after a 10 minute wait.  We finally got our drinks a few minutes later.   Breakfast arrived 25 minutes later. My wife's egg whites were okay. The home fries were hard and not very tasty. The sausage gravy was lacking something, oh, yeah, sausage flavor. It tasted like flour and grease stirred up with some salt and pepper. The home fries have a weird spice flavor I didn't care for. I tasted them all day.  Nothing was hot. Tepid would be a good word.  The bill came faster than the flatware did, with a hefty total. Sausage  gravy w/ eggs and home fries and ice tea , egg whites and home fries and muffin and hot tea, and a juice. $28+.   Not what I expected from other reviews. Three strikes , I'm out. The door that is. Not letting it hit me either. Not going back."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I have come to Egg Works for breakfast(second time this week). This is hands down the BEST place I've ever been to for breakfast. The staff is very friendly(the waitress remember us from the other day) and the food comes out within a reasonable amount of time regardless if it's busy or not. Of course the busier times tend to be in the morning early afternoon. If you go after 1pm it's dead and you get a table right away. The menu contains a large variety of choices from classic favorites and eggs Benedict to omelettes and skillets and pancakes even Hawaiian style options like \"loco moco\" and \"spam n eggs\". Every time I come here I try to get something different today we went with \"the works breakfast skillet\" that was amazing!! The base was a bed of egg works signature potatoes seasoned with diablo spices, mixed with bacon, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, onion, cheese and tomatoes topped with over easy eggs. We also ordered the \"spinach Benedict\" a nice classic Benny with poached eggs, Canadian bacon and spinach topped with hollandaise sauce. We even got a free banana nut muffin for checking in on yelp. Definitely the place to go in Vegas!!! And the cost is so good for how much food you get. Makes it so worth it."}
{"text":"This breakfast was almost orgasmic. I had my 3 young children with me though so I didn't let it get that far.  We were staying at the Red Rock Inn and wanted to venture out from the basic restaurants at the hotel & ended up here.   I am on a healthy eating kick but since it was vacation I wasn't too picky but I ordered the veggie something or other (where the eggs Benedicts are).   It consisted of hollandaise sauce, poached eggs, A LOT (!!!) of avocado, spinach, & tomatoes.   It was seriously one of the top 5 best breakfasts I've ever had. So delicious. Idk if it was the hollandaise sauce, or they just cooked it with a lot of love- it was good.   The rest of the fam ordered loco moco (hamburger patty, rice and gravy) and two kids meals: one with eggs and bacon and the other French toast. The loco moco and the eggs and bacon kids meal each came with a banana bread muffin thing. If you check in, you can also get one for free. It was a tad sweeter & stickier than I liked, but still good.  Our waiter was always prompt and polite. Good customer service.   You pay up front for the record."}
{"text":"Started out with biscuits and gravy. Two bites and it was so salty I couldn't even continue. Waitress was great even came back to tell me that they tried it and threw it out. Next up the eggs benny. I usually get my eggs over medium because no one can seem to poach eggs properly. This time I forgot but was pleasantly surprised. The eggs were perfect. My waitress Dianna was super. Very attentive and so sweet. All and all a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Our office moved over here a few months ago and I finally got to try this yesterday.  This place was great!  Since I went for lunch on a weekday the place was not busy at all and we were seated immediately.  I have to say the hostess was not pleasant at all.    Our waitress however, was fantastic.  All smiles and super helpful.  As others mentioned they have that little eggy thing that you can flip over for help, but I honestly forgot it was there because there was a constant stream of employees in the area always ready to grab whatever you needed.  And smiling, friendly employees, something I haven't seen in this city in years.  We both ordered the stuffed french toast which is really just a french toast sandwich.  It had scrambled eggs and cheese in the middle.  I got mine with the Works potatoes which were fantastic - just the right seasoning.  My friend got hers with fruit instead.  The food was served super quick also.  5 stars all the way for me!"}
{"text":"Love me some egg works. I come here weekly. Usually to pick up and take home. Their banana nut muffins are my kids favorite. Sometimes I got there just for that, no kidding. Service is usually great, foods is always on point."}
{"text":"Food was great and filling.. Rossy was very helpful and kind.. Will come back when I'm back in town"}
{"text":"A large, really solid outlet of a local chain that serves diner-type fare, but in heaping portions and with a tremendous selection too.   The breakfast portion of the menu spans 4 pages, with myriad choices, whether eggy items like benedicts, omelets, scrambles, skillets, crepes; or other breakfast fare like burritos, pancakes, waffles, French toast, hash, biscuits & gravy, or country fried steak. So much calorific goodness to choose from that I had to come twice! The biscuits & gravy was perfect comfort food for a winter morning, while the omelets were quite hefty and came with potatoes and a choice of toast or a warm, housemade banana nut muffin (yes, please do choose the latter).  There are also more substantive non-breakfast dishes here like burgers, sandwiches, and salads. Service is super fast and efficient here, and there are plenty of seats, whether at the counter or at many tables throughout the fairly large venue. Simply lots of good stuff served fast."}
{"text":"If you want Breakfast... they have everything you could possibly think of for morning grub. My friend ordered the classic breakfast, I ordered the California \"crepe\" It's a little bit firmer than a crepe. Loaded with lots of goodies, some more than others, but all tasty. Their breakfast potatoes are very good with all the seasoning.  The downfall was the service. One person took our drink order, a different person took our food order, and a third person served us. Unfortunately no one came back to check on us to see if we liked everything or needed anything. I tried a couple of times to get someone's attention to get a refill, but that failed. With the servers, you see a lot of backs, because their standing at the kitchen counter chatting and waiting for the food orders to come out. Oh, and I never got my banana muffin with my meal. I would say maybe because they were busy, but there were plenty of tables open."}
{"text":"Great spot and don't let the parking lot fool you! It's a tiny parking lot so it always looks unbelievably busy... Make sure you walk inside to check it out before driving to the next spot because I know we almost made that mistake. We walked in and were seated right away *bonus points when you're hungry* lol the food was good and the mimosa was AWESOME! He best part of our entire experience though was our server heather! I really enjoyed her personality, guidance with the menu and attentiveness! We will be back to visit her!"}
{"text":"Great food and service Rob was very professional and made our experience even better. We've been to the other restaurants in this chain but this was the best."}
{"text":"Girlfriend  B Day ,didn't  even  sing happy B Day to her sang it to somebody  else  felt  even."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment! We called ahead for a large group of 21 guests. The wait was only 20 minutes. That was the good part. We had one person serving us and taking orders. They put us at 2 tables next to each other, which was fine. Our waitress took one tables order and then left. Came back 10 minutes later and took the other tables order and then left. Table 1 got our good in about 15 minutes. 45 minutes goes by and table 1 is fine eating when table 2 barely gets their food! We turn the happy face to sad and at least 5 staff members walk past without stopping to ask what's wrong. Our waitress finally lolligags over and flips the faces back without asking. So I demanded to understand why half of MY guests didn't have their food. She says she split our order to help the flow of the kitchen. Ok that's fine but a 45 minutes gap is not ok. You could tell she just wanted us to leave by then. I was livid. If my family would have let me I would have not left a tip. None of us will ever return to this restaurant again. Horrible service!!! I should've known this from a few weeks ago when they completely forgot my daughters scrambled egg plate but the food was good so we chalked it up to an oversight and they didn't charge us for her scrambled eggs and toast. Don't waste your time unless you get a good server, which we did not!!!"}
{"text":"Marianne is such a get waitress! There are a lot of options to choose from for breakfast from American, hawaiian, and Mexican! Biscuits and gravy were amazing. The hashbrowns are perfectly seasoned and to die for. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Updated review: AND STILL... Egg works is a 5 star location and deserves an updated review. All of my previous reviews in egg works were 5 stars, but this time I NEED to share my last experience with my waitress Mari-YAH!   Service: Mariyah (hope I am spelling this right) was one of the most entertaining servers I have ever had at any restaurant. ***on a side note if Mariyah sees this review, slide into my DMs as I would love to take you out ;)****. Anyways, I haven't laughed this hard at breakfast since, well ever.   Food: I have literally tried everything on the menu at this point and love 90% of the food. The omelettes are great, but the Mexican omelette and the chilli ones are my fav. The corn beef hash is my favorite breakfast though! For lunch, I'm a huge gumbolaya fan! It's legit!   Location: the place is always busy and you should expect a wait on the weekend. The place is clean and great!   But again, Mari-YAH, you the best! :)"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in my neck of the woods... Server was Manuela and she was better than the breakfast!"}
{"text":"Ah the prestigious 5 star review. This place has great coffee and all the food is great. My fav is the pork carnitas rancheros, but the veggie Benny is a close second, but so is the stuffed French toast, it's a egg and bacon delight sandwiched between two thick pieces of French Toast. It really is quite amazing. From hence forth all sandwiches will be used with French toast. It will end wars and develop peace around the world."}
{"text":"I always like this place, the food is good, the service is usually good, and it has a nice, casual atmosphere. My husband loves their benedicts (mainly because of the hollandaise) and I usually go for a skillet. I did learn a valuable lesson this trip though, when presented with the massive portion that I knew I would never be able to get through. You can order a half portion of most of the menu items! Who knew? Not me. I will definately be taking advantage of this next time I visit becase I didn't make a dent in my food this trip. The only complaint I have this visit is that I didn't receive my toast or my complimentary muffin for Yelp check-in. Not that I needed the extra food, it's just the fact that it was forgotten."}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat very solid breakfast I enjoy here very much you should definitely try it if you haven't been"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great prices!! I ordered one of the breakfast skillets and it was enough for me to get full and save the rest for lunch and be full again"}
{"text":"Great food great service from Thaynara! Customized skillet is a great way to start the morning."}
{"text":"Good food good service! I liked the homemade corn beef hash and Candice was great! A great spot for breakfast. Next time I have to try their chicken fried steak"}
{"text":"Yep! Still my favorite place for breakfast.  This local franchise consistently delivers a great meal no matter which location you visit.  This was my first time to this location in Summerlin.  I think I prefer this location to the others simply because it was quiet an calm.   Our server was very sweet and efficient.  Our food was delivered to our 6 top very quickly.  One of my absolute favorite items on the menu is the habla Diabla potatoes. I can never make a visit without munching on an order.   Another great feature about this location is the pet friendly patio with a great view of Town Center drive. How exciting it is watching people navigate through the traffic circle.  Not as thrilling as watching a Russian dash cam video clip but close enough."}
{"text":"Met up with a family friend up here.  The breakfast was good our server Donna was great.  The banana muffins were really good"}
{"text":"Just went  there for breakfast.  It was crazy busy but I was seated within 15 minutes, which was the time quoted by the hostess.  Our server gave great service.  She refilled water without asking.  I ordered the Country Benny.  Good flavor on the gravy and the eggs were cooked just like I like them, over easy and he yolk very runny.  The bicsuits were okay but could have been more crumbly.   I ordered a side of bacon because it isn't breakfast without bacon.  The bacon was okay but I will not be reordering.  Coffee was okay but I like the fact they put the whole pot on the table.  I really like their potato. Not a hash brown fan.  My friend wanted hashbrowns but she had these instead and really liked them.  The portions are good and the prices were right."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place for breakfast! Went 2 days in a row. Food is delicious! The potatoes are the signature side, nice a seasoned! Sat at the bar in the back.  They have a 7 man crew whipping out the breakfast fast and accurate! A person double checks before the waitress take it out. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. We go here almost very Sunday. We always get seated right away and all the servers are very attentive to our table. Today we had the lovely Donna as a server. She was an absolute delight even though she was super busy she made time for us. Good luck with Disneyland Donna!"}
{"text":"My family and I come in and are seated without anyone asking if we would like anything to drink while we wait for our server! Then another group of people come in after us and is seated next to us with menus and drinks, coffee and water specifically..it took roughly 10 minutes for ANYONE to approach us about our order...we changed our mood to the sad egg and only then did we received service from the establishment!!!"}
{"text":"The food at Egg Works on Flamingo is always consistent DELICIOUS!  We  ask to be seated where server James is working as his service is outstanding no matter how busy it is he always manages to stay on top of everything with a positive attitude and a smile for everyone- James is definitely an asset for the business!! Love everything on the menu my favorite is a Loko Moco and the Crepes"}
{"text":"This morning was my first visit, and my wife and I were left rather disappointed. We thought it would be great, since there were hoards of people waiting in line outside. But since we sat at the bar, we didn't have to wait. I ordered the chicken and spinach skillet, and my wife ordered the corned beef hash. Both of us found our dishes to be extremely salty. The potatoes in my skillet made it really salty, and my wife's corned beef was salty...as well as her potatoes. The service was fine, but other than that, I don't find anything special about this place...I most likely won't come back.  I would rather go to the pancake house on ft apache or babystacks cafe."}
{"text":"this place is amazing!!!! i've seen the sign for it many times but finally got a chance to go in and try it out for myself. i hear during the weekends it's packed, but on a tuesday morning it wasn't bad at all. the service was great and the ambience is just lovely. my favorite part about this place is the cute little train that rides around! very custom and cozy little joint with incredible food! i feel like ill never eat again!! definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This place is super busy and I know why. Service is awesome and food is super good!!! We went on a Sunday after church. My niece only eats spam and Portuguese sausage and the Hubby loves Loco Moco. The place was packed and the wait was about 30 min for 9 people.  Anyway, our server's name was Eythan and he was super nice. Really enjoyed it here. We also had an additional server named PK. It felt like Home (Hawaii) eating there because I felt the Aloha. Looking forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"I love this location. Great food. Great service. I always get one of the Hawaiian style breakfasts like the loco moco. I checked in here and got a free banana nut muffin !!! Which I loved. Our server Hector kept em coming too. He was great!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday morning at approximately 10:00 AM. We got seated fairly quickly, even though the place was quite full.  We had a really great service, our server Nicole did a really great job attending to our needs and getting our food out quickly. Since it was our first time, it took us a while to sift through the menu, which looks like a newspaper. I liked that, so unique!  There were so many choices, it was hard to decide. We got the \"works\" skillet and the mashed potato omelet. Both were delicious! The banana nut muffin was so good, I wish we could have had more of that. I want to go back here!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for over 10 years. We have never left not being satisfied. Once you walk in the front door you are ALWAYS greeted with professionalism. The service by all servers is top notch. The person who rated Linda on 03/06 as rude, etc., obviously previously had a bad night. LINDA is always going beyond to accommodate everyone and appreciate her smile Linda and others keep up the great work.  If you have not been here before go and you will find out why you will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Kelli was great ! Highly recommended server. I did not know what I really wanted and she helped explain their pancake special. I was very happy to see they had turkey bacon as well."}
{"text":"So much great food.  Jennifer our waitress rocks.   Nice girl. Caring with amazing service.  My coffee cup was always warm!"}
{"text":"Horrible!! With the word 'Egg' as their business you'd figure they would know how to make medium scrambled eggs. The waffle was cold and the Ham steak was over cooked. Will not visit again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. I went here with a group of my friends and we had a really positive experience. Our server was Amy and she took such great care of us. Amy was extremely attentive, polite, and she always had a smile on her face. Thanks Amy!!!...Moving on, the atmosphere is like a country side farm and it's really casual and relaxed. I ordered the soup and salad; it was ok kinda wished I ordered a breakfast platter instead but it was decent."}
{"text":"Wow! What a fabulous new dining experience!  Another new Las Vegas  restaurant for us. Huge portions, one of a kind banana-nut muffin, delicious coffee - hot chocolate mix! The skillets, tho..... we had the country works skillet (gluten free), stuffed French toast sandwich, the veggie omelet with extra bacon, and Ensenada breakfast burrito...all simply extraordinary! Each skillet had an unique scrumptious flavor. Such excellent service from Rob G. And Dianne!!  He was so personable and anticipated the needs our group of five! Make your way to Eggs Works, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Big portions, great taste. Our server was Raul and was excellent. Oh and you have to have a Bloody Mary to go with breakfast!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. Everytime I'm in town from California,  this place is a must! More specifically Christian is an amazing server. HIS charisma, knowledge base of the menu items, makes for thee best experience ever. I never look at the menu, he just recommends something and serves it up right! If you are in the culinary industry as am I.....scout him out...oh and not to mention...good looking ;)"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast around town in my opinion; way too much food ..... make sure you get their addicting potatoes!"}
{"text":"Go see Jennifer one of the Best server you will ever have . Huge smile , great suggestions and quick service. Best breakfast ever..."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place food is awesome staff is great and we will continue to come back here! A little added bonus for our visit today is that were enjoying our breakfast in the rain and our waiter Christian has a awesome personality and was verry respectful to my family! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"I come here for brunch every week with my pals. The food is quite delish, and most definitely affordable (although money is no problem for me). I would be most impressed if they added mimosas to the menu, my brunch would be complete. Robert is an excellent server, I don't believe I've had a better server here."}
{"text":"The kids love it & the portion sizes are huge definitely a great place to share plates"}
{"text":"Tried Egg Works on S Eastern after it opened. I found it easy to get into and reasonably priced. Location is great as well.   However the food just wasn't very inspired. I did not expect something special but the food was just pretty basic. Honestly I think you get more creativity at Ihop. I had the steak and eggs. A pretty simple breakfast dish and found the steak to be underseasoned and dull. Still waiting for that great off the strip breakfast restaurant. Maybe one day!"}
{"text":"I have eaten breakfast here everyday for the past three days. I am in town for a wedding and this place was early enough for this east coaster with some killer jet lag.   OMG I love this place!! Fast service, lovely waiters and waitresses, and just overall a solid place for food. I got the same thing everyday because I am typical and know what I like. I would get the veggie omelette. Everything was made super fresh to order which was awesome. The veggies always tasted really great and the way they made the food was clearly with love.   I would probably eat here 3-4 times a week if I lived here. They know what they are doing, the prices are right, and the people are great. Thank you for taking care of this early bird out of towner. I will be back if I am ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Great Food! Excellent Service. Heather is amazing . Love that they have Hawaiian style breakfast plates like Loco Mocos! Banana muffin is delicious ! Extensive menu options. My first experience was yesterday and wanted to come back again today. Glad I did . 5 stars"}
{"text":"I've been to Egg Works more times than I can count. However, this was my first time at this location.  I went to this Egg Works with a few friends of mine. One of them is allergic to all milk products and let the waitress know this. However, when his food came, there was butter on the toast. The butter side was face-down, and he bit into it unknowingly. He had a small allergic reaction as a result.   They then asked my boyfriend to give them their tip out loud, something I've never heard of being done at any other restaurant. I thought that was unusual.  Overall, I wasn't happy and will be sticking to their other locations in the future."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to bring the family and friends! I took my girlfriend and her daughter for breakfast it was so good we went back the next day!"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars, service is great. Food is good and this place actually makes a decent biscuits and gravy most places I try it's just not edible and they let me swap toast for the B&G. Only .95 up charge not a bad deal. I highly reccomend Egg Works to anyone that likes breakfast."}
{"text":"Average at best, I was recommended this place  by a collegue. We got the traditional american breakfasts:   Corned beef hash, eggs, potatoes Meat lovers omelete.   The omelete lacked flavor, don't ask how that is possible but this place did it. My corned beef hash was very salty, it was made in house but they should probably revert back to the canned kind.   They have buckwheat pancakes which can be gluten free, when I asked the waitress about it she had no idea. I didn't want to take a chance so I let it lie.   Food came out quick and it was decent priced. I am sure if you have their hispanic oriented breakfast it may be better. They do have a large menu, lot's of options to choose from."}
{"text":"Staff is so nice, food is great. They are super upbeat like their eggs...beat up right.  And they have a cute thing on table where if you need help you just flip to a certain face.  Denny's cannot even compare to this.  Portions are huge....i suggest sharing.    We had a large party and they were so nice to accommodate all of us and our very needy kids.  Water here, napkins there, extra forks, extra Plastic forks, this, that.......they all do with a great attitude.  Will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"My arteries hate me when I come here because I usually get either the country Benedict (sausage and eggs on biscuits with gravy) or chicken fried steak. This place is usually very busy, but they do a really good job of keeping wait times down. They have a dog friendly patio and excellent service."}
{"text":"5 of us came in and were greeted with a big smile. I loved my skillet and the other four loved their meals also. The potatoes are great and I loved them and was stealing off of peoples plates. Great way to start the morning."}
{"text":"Our first time here from California.  We had the Sundance special with blackened chicken. Sooo good!!!  Rosey & the rest of the staff were great. We sat at the counter. It's great seeing how incredibly efficient everyone is during a busy Sunday brunch.  Kudos to all of you. We'll make sure to come back again."}
{"text":"I'm starting to think that I give out too many 5-star reviews, but as a self-proclaimed potato addict that finally found the perfect \"breakfast potatoes\", I really can't see how this place doesn't deserve all 5 stars.   Facetiousness aside, I had the Sundance Special which was an omelette with mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, and artichokes folded inside with swiss cheese, then topped with tomatoes and feta cheese. It came with those ever-so-tasty, fantastically seasoned potatoes and a choice of toast or banana nut bread muffin. The muffins are homemade everyday, and taste every bit as tasty. They're sticky, moist, and not overpowering on the banana flavor.   I really can't wait to come back here, as the coffee was decent--although not the best I've had, the service was friendly, quick, and overall quite efficient, and the space is nice, light and airy. Everything that is just right about a breakfast spot. Also, it wasn't that busy for a Wednesday morning. I'd imagine this place would be packed on a weekend morning, but then again it would probably be with good reason."}
{"text":"I am one picky son of a b* & I must tell you that the service & food here is worth the trip! Good job egg people!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Egg Works, and overall it was a great experience! Service was quick and friendly, and our server, DONNA, was extremely sociable and efficient!   Once we finally decided what to eat from the wealth of delicious options, the food was delivered quickly and was, in fact, quite delicious! A great place to eat for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb bomb and the people are very friendly! Great food, eggs are awesome here, I mean AWESOME. The muffins...best muffins I have ever had in my life. Soft, sweet and delicious. I come here quite often, I just came in today before work to get some breakfast goodness!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here 2/16! Wanted to bring the kids for brunch since they were off from school for president's day weekend! Was expecting a long line & there was but the wait was bearable! Had Jazmin as our server & she was GREAT! She suggested a couple local favorites and we enjoyed all of our orders! Jazmin was friendly & efficient!! Happy that we got her to serve us! We'll return & look for her again next time"}
{"text":"I am from Arizona and was in Vegas for a weekend getaway. I found this restaurant off Groupon- $20 for 2 guests towards breakfast or lunch. I arrived around 1130am on a Sunday. There were multiple guests inside and out so i feared a long wait time. I was told 35mins. I would say i was seated in about 20 so thats was great! It didn't take long at all to get our food, give or take 15mins. It was absolutely amazing!!! I did go over my $20 Groupon voucher, however; it was still worth it to go over!! I will definitely have to stop by again when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This Egg Works was a bit of a drive for my fiance and I, but I wanted to try it. We came at peak brunch hour on a Sunday and the place was packed. However, we were seated in 15 minutes. Our server, Paul, was very direct but very friendly. We used the check in on Yelp at the end of our meal and received our free muffin which looks amazing (too full to try it yet!). I had the Stuffed French Toast, which was surprisingly delicious. My fiance had the Blackened Prime Rib Benny, which didn't have as much prime rib as we expected, but he liked in none-the-less. I'm sure we'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Always a favorite and our server Jessica was pleasant and helpful, we will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"AMANDA AMANDA AMANDA. She was our server and she is amazing. We have two tiny kids, one of them was sick, and she was just a ROCKSTAR in serving us. She was so intuitive, she brought napkins and kids cups and all those things little kids need, without us having to ask. But she also didn't hover or pester or \"over-help.\" The service was perfect, THANK YOU AMANDA! Food is delicious there, I loved the pumpkin pancakes, my kids loved the mouse pancake. HUGE servings, so brace yourself. :)"}
{"text":"Suzzy was a great server and the food was awesome! It was so fresh and the prices were affordable. Even more affordable because I had purchased a groupon the month before while planning for my Vegas trip! :)  Egg Works is not located on the strip, so it did take a good 15 minutes to drive there from Caesar's Palace.   We ordered the chicken fried steak, waffles, and chorizo skillet. I've never had such a delicious chicken fried steak before! The gravy was also very yummy. It came with Cajun potatoes that had a ton of seasoning, but I like that kind of thing. If you're not a fan of salt, ask them to go light on the cage.  The waffles and syrup was also great, and the skillet was hot and cheesy. I can't wait to go back!  Tip: I loved that they are so attentive, there's an egg with a smiley face and a frowning face. When you turn it to the sad side, any employee will stop and ask you what you need. It's so great when they all help each other.  I purposely ordered a dish that came with a banana nut muffin and boy, was I glad I did! It was so hot and the muffin top made me wanting more. Luckily, there was leftovers and I ate it as a snack on the drive home.  See you again soon, Eggy!"}
{"text":"Eggsactly what I was looking for in a breakfast place while in Vegas!!! Such a great classic breakfast with hearty servings. This is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas that I visit everytime I go back.   I'm a sucker for Eggs Benedict and while many people have written about them, they seriously are consistently good everytime. Poached eggs cooked just right served under a nice blanket of hollandaise. It's overall the classic taste you're looking for in a homecooked breakfast.   My friends are always pleased when I take them here.   *Note: They do get REALLY busy! But you know, they also do a great job of providing service that's friendly and quick. Our wait wasn't more than 10 minutes. I say, stick around and enjoy the ambiance!! Much better to hang out for a table than drive around in the desert sun looking for some place that will compare....and it's going to be a while before you find that place. :)"}
{"text":"I always get the Miso Fried Eggs and they are fantastic. The banana nut muffin is a total bonus as well! they have a huge selection on their menu for whatever egg you want. The servings are ginormous and the taste is out of this world. The management is clearly on top of this operation since the quality is so consistent even at multiple locations. Very good place to grab breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"Oh yummy! We got a table very quickly on a Sunday morning at 9am. I ordered The Works Benny and it was delish!! Would love to try the breakfast pizza special next time!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my husband's friend. It's a bit far from the strip but will worth it. This will be a must visit when coming to Vegas. I don't remember the name if the food of what we got but it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place was so great. Nikki was such a great waitress and the food was outstanding"}
{"text":"awesome  breakfast!!! service was fabulous and the food was just heavenly!!!! used my yelp for.muffin and groupon for discount. stomach is puffed and tuffed!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoying breakfast with family is always a pleasure at egg works. Wait times vary every time but it's always worth the wait! Our server Donna was very attentive and made sure we were good several times. We'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"This place does not deserve a 3 star even, I don't understand how it's at 4.5. This place has terrible service and not even good food. I have had much better breakfast at Denny's. I wish there is a negative point system on Yelp.  I came here on a Monday with my husband as he loves breakfast. This little traditional looking diner looks promising. After we got seated and ordered water, our server did not come back until 10 minutes to take our order. We ordered 2 coffees, corn hash with English muffins,  and veggies skillet with English muffins.   To start of with coffee, our pot never came after 15 minutes and even the table next to us that came later got their coffee pot. We tried to wave down our server, she didn't even looked at us and said in a bad attitude that there were only three of them and please bare with me. We would've understand and be OK with the delay if it wasn't her attitude.   When our food arrived, they said will bring out my husband's English muffins in a bit. Of course,  it never came until we waved down our server 15 minutes later. She never came to check with us if the food were ok. It turns out, my husband's corn hash was too salty. She insisted my husband to order something else but at this point his appetite was ruined. She did bring out more English muffins to make up for it but it was kind of late.  My veggies skillet wasn't exactly in an iron skilet but a skillet shaped dish. I wish the menu had said something this dish is all raw veggies.  Other than potatoes on the bottom of the dish, the onions, bell peppers, mushrooms,  tomatoes,  and spinach were raw. I went light on cheese do everything was not cooked a bit. It was basic a salad with bedded potatoes and topped with bit of cheese and 2 eggs. I asked for over medium eggs but it came out over easy. I would at least want my onion and mushrooms cooked in some way.  When our bill came, we noticed the corn hash was taken off the check but added with \"a classic\". Then she explained to us the manager replaced the corn hash with the classic because the potato were eaten. When we pay our check at the front, the manager told my husband that she was under the impression the rest of eaten except the corn hash. She finally taken it off, and we left $0 tip.  It was one of the worse experiences I could have at an American restaurant.  I've never been to a place they take of the $11 food you didn't like but replace with a $8 dish that we did not had. They didn't have the most superb menu and I could have the same thing at a different place but with much better service. Never going back.  I really don't normally write such an extensive review but our experience here is way out of our expectations at a restaurant, in a horrible way."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place too eat in Vegas. The food is always good the service even when busy is friendly and most the time quick. I mix up my orders and they are always good. Even tried a club sandwich for lunch the other day haha. I would highly recommend this place too anyone that has not ate here before."}
{"text":"Delicious homestyle breakfast with The Works!!! Perfect \"PICK ME UP/WAKE YOUR @$$ UP\" FOOD!! Staff are attentive and customer advocates. Rec'd complimentary coffee while I waited for \"to-go/take out\" order. Very intuitive! TV's at the counter so u can catch up with the news/sports/gossip/BS, etc... :P A must try for *Eggceptional breakfast eggsperience!! Must have the Banana Nut Muffin!!!! Check for Groupon/Yelp deals!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing ... Thanks Perry!!  Food is delicious! We had the taco skillet and the bacon and avocado omelet...   Coffee was good! Definitely a must if you are traveling to Vegas and want something off the beaten path!!"}
{"text":"Attentive service from Jennifer. Good sized portions. I had the omelette with feta, spinach and Swiss, slightly heavy on the cheese for me otherwise delicious. Blueberry pancakes good flavor. My cousin has the French toast which she enjoyed. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Donna our server was amazing! I love this place and always enjoy eating here. Make sure to ask to sit in her section when you do come to enjoy the egg deliciousness."}
{"text":"This is our first visit to this egg works....we live closer to the anthem location but we happened to be in the area...lucked out on a groupon too!    Veronica served us and she was awesome! We didn't have to flip the happy/sad egg ever because she continually checked on our table.  Our food was delivered quickly with no error and it was nice to see her swiftly moving about tending to all of her tables.  Her personality was bubbly and energetic which is nice in the morning and she was always smiling!   If ever in the area ask for Veronica's section!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my family this morning...we're originally from Hawaii so our server PK was a great reminder of home...he was awesome in tending to our table! We definitely plan to make it a more routine breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"So far, Joaquin is wonderful. Service has been great!  The  banana nut muffins are amazing. The \"works\" skillet and a half an order and huge!!!!  The best breakfast we've had out here!"}
{"text":"I have come here several times and I always get the best service and food. Today I had the pleasure of having Victoria at the bar and she was just awesome! Very attentive and worked the heck out of that window. She was the sexiest reindeer that I have seen :-)! I will be back and hope to get her again or any of the ladies because they are all great servers. I hope VICTORIA wins a trip to Disney!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice, friendly staff and atmosphere. Good portions on meals and it's always a plus for me when a restaurant is pet friendly."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday morning. Wasn't busy at all and the staff was friendly and service right away. The atmosphere was really cute and I enjoyed the trains all the wall. Definitely felt like a homey kind of place. I ordered the eggs Benedict which I'm very picky. Are usually eat breakfast on the strip so I have a good idea but good hollandaise sauce should taste like. I wasn't disappointed. The only thing was that it was a little too saucy which made my English muffin a little soggy. Details are great and so was my pancakes. The only thing that they could've done differently was make sure that our waiter was it completely missing in action. I did have to wait for some coffee refills for a while and I ran out of water a lot. Other than that i would definitely go back.."}
{"text":"I got the Hawaiian french toast which is just french toast with Hawaiian bread. I didn't think the use of bread was good. I ate two of them then ordered a chili to attempt to fill myself. That was lukewarm. The person I came with seemed to like their eggs though"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places.  They have a lot of variety on the menu and everything I have ever ordered has been outstanding.  It does get crowded at peak times. Come early or late morning to avoid the rush.  The staff is friendly, the prices are reasonable and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"I've always wondered why this place is always so busy. I know why now!! The food is delicious! Love the environment the employees help project. Victoria was wonderful today. The quality, quantity, and how quickly my food arrived topped my expectations! I will def be returning."}
{"text":"Skip the toast go for the banana muffin!!! It's home made and delicious!!! Nice and warm then you add butter and it melts in your mouth with yummy banana goodness!   So you walk in and you see tin roofs on the wall with country scenery. If you need to use the bathroom just look for the out house painted on the wall.   The biscuits and gravy are so good. I ordered the sunrise mountain and I thought it was a sandwich. It is a croissant open faced with scrambled eggs and diced meat with tons of cheese and potatoes on the side in a skillet. Hugeeeeeee portion. I barely ate a 1/4 of it."}
{"text":"I have been to several zof their locations over the years and have always enjoyed the quality of food and service. They get a bit overwhelmed when super busy, but who wouldn't? I get the eggs taliano, with no onions - mmmhhmmm! The banana nut muffin is worth traveling for as well. They have an excellent product and fantastic service, but understand that a business that does great is usually busy....."}
{"text":"Our 1st Yelp failure. MAJOR Yelp failure. So sad. Quite possibly the worst breakfast we've ever had!  Pro: Delicious Banana Nut Muffins. 1 son liked his eggs & bacon, but said potatoes were ok.  Cons: Corned Beef Hash tasted like mushy cat food. Are a few bites & couldn't choke down any more. Potatoes are odd & over seasoned. Husbands omelet was edible enough for him to eat 2/3, but he said it was just ok. Kids pancake wasn't even good. :/   Our kids asked if we could give it a \"0\" or 1/2 Star. 1 star is for the tasty muffin...which was the only enjoyable part of our $40+ breakfast.  Such a bummer!"}
{"text":"Well, first time here, moving to Vegas. What a great find... worth the visit just on the potatoes alone. Decided to try the Country fried steak & eggs. Excellent!! Unique country gravy that was wonderful!! Hit the spot!!   BTW... have returned multiple times and as good as the first time!!! Great Bfast place!!"}
{"text":"Love this location, there's plenty of parking and it's not bad getting in and out.  It's a great place for anyone looking for breakfast food or even a burger.  There's a train in the ceiling and just a fun atmosphere.  Service is always good here and the food is good.  Definitely a place to repeat!"}
{"text":"Great place and service! I had the pleasure of eating here and Jazmin was great. The best server I've had in a while. The food was also delicious. We heard about this place from a friend who ate here before while on vacation and had to go. Food can be good but having a great server to attend to you makes everything great. Thank again!!"}
{"text":"This place was also decent in terms of decor and atmosphere! It is a little bit quieter compared to cracked egg, but I feel like they're pretty similar in terms of their savory items in the menu!   The food was good, but nothing surprising in my opinion. I nice simple breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Had the Works Omelette and was really ono...the winner was the fried potatoes with the rub was unreal.  The banana nut muffin they gave us as a first time visitor was so fresh.  Amazing"}
{"text":"Worth the wait. Tables turn fast. Cincinnati Chili on the breakfast menu!  I lived in Cinti for seven years and have come to love it. This place did a pretty could job of coming quite close in taste.  The Greek scramble was even better.   Don't be fooled by the ugly retail plex, this place was great. Service fun and bloody Mary's tasty.  A nice stop for anyone visiting Sunset park next door."}
{"text":"We went to Egg Works for the first time this past Sunday and I must say the experience was awesome.  Lina was our server she was friendly and attentive.  The food was good but the service was great. We will return."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Vegas! We used to go often when we lived around the corner, now go every trip home to visit! Get the Sunrise Mountain with sausage for breakfast! So good!!! We also picked up their potatoe seasoning and use it at home often."}
{"text":"Hidden yem! We found this place after an interesting night. The staff is extremely welcoming and the service is fast.   Donna our server took this experience to the next level! She was upbeat, friendly, and offered exceptional hospitality! The food was on point. We ordered a veggie omelette with avocado (as per Donna's suggestion) DELICIOUS!  We also ordered the waffle works. The eggs (on both plates) we a bit bland but the rest was very good. Quite large portions! Freshly brewed unlimited coffee of course! Definitely coming back next time.    We got 2 complimentary chocolate banana muffins as a first time courtesy."}
{"text":"Great food. Nice atmosphere. Pricing is reasonable. I would call it an upscale diner."}
{"text":"The waitress Tarbatha is awesome. I order three orange juices. She told to me to order one pitch which save some money. The food is so good too."}
{"text":"I don't EVER write reviews because I don't feel the need to but holy sh*t, the green chili hash is one of the BEST breakfast dishes I've ever had. It might look a little basic when you get it but all the flavors together, are perfect. On top of that, the service is great and the mom-and-pop atmosphere is very relaxing."}
{"text":"Always consistent. Only $7 for a half order omelet with potatoes and a muffin... can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Been before there are so many variations in LV of this place it gets a bit confusing. Solid breakfast food at reasonable prices. Great home fries/tatters and their white gravy is delicious."}
{"text":"Came here after an event and Raul took care of us! Our parents came from out of town and they loved their experience and the food was amazing.   The key largo crepe was in point and hit all the right taste buds between the meat and the eggs. And the muffin is a A WIN every time. We will def come back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast places in town! So many choices and large portions! I always have breakfast left for the next day! It is a busy atmosphere on Sundays, which is usually the day I go. The service is quick, there are TVs there for the sports people who don't want to miss a game. It's great for kids too! Kids menu & coloring pages."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come here every Saturday around 11:30a for breakfast. This place always has great food and excellent customer service. The only issue I ever had was handled promptly and the server was incredibly helpful. Seriously the best place to eat in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Egg Works. My partner and I didn't know what to eat when we woke up. I did a quick search of breakfast places nearby and egg works popped up...as well as IHOP. I honestly kind of enjoy IHOP a little, but we decided to do something different. I expected Egg Works to be a very generic breakfast place, but man was I wrong.  Walking in it looks typical. Until you see the little toy train racing long a track that's suspended near the ceiling of the restaurant. The train and little Egg people riding on it. Adorable. The place had a wait, but it was only 10minutes even though there was a good 8 people ahead of us. I thought that was pretty awesome and the reason why it was so quick a wait I'll explain shortly.  After we were seated we were greeted by a very kind woman who had a southern twang in her voice and was rocking a full set of braces. I noticed because she was all smiles all the time. The best way I can describe her personality is what you'd expect from someone touting that \"southern hospitality\" everyone speaks of.  The menu was super unique. It was in the style of a newspaper. Like seriously you just read the menu like a newspaper! I know, I'm amazed by simple things. They had a pretty extensive menu. From country fried steak to breakfast burritos to 5-6 different types of french toast. For real, if you like french toast, then go here. I may not have tried it, but any place that cooks up carrot cake french toast deserves a must a try stamp.  I went with the country fried steak and my partner got the breakfast burrito. Now here's where the explanation for the wait time is. Two minutes after we ordered I was server by banana bread muffin (delicious) and 7 minutes after the muffin we got out food. Wooow was it fast. It's something I'm not used to coming from Chicago.  The portion sizes were great. They gave you a heaping pile of their signature Diablo potatoes, which are just seasoned home fries. They were amaaazing. Loads of flavor and cooked well so they weren't hard. The country fried steak was delicious. Very tender, no tough parts at all, and the gravy was extra creamy tasting. I think it had bits of ham in it if I'm not mistaken.   My partner's breakfast burrito was very good as well. They basically took a breakfast skillet and dumped it on a tortilla and rolled it into a burrito. It was packed with ingredients. There was a whole lot of flavor in each bite. They also give you a hot sauce/salsa that reminds me of Taco Bell fire sauce but in a good way. It adds a nice smoky flavor if you like that.  When the bill came, I wasn't taken aback by the price or anything. It was very agreeable with the service and quality of food I received. Overall this place was great and I advise anyone in the area to try it out if you love a good breakfast. If I lived in Vegas I'd be eating there a lot."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful breakfast with our server, Laura! The did was yummy. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots! Always busy on Sundays but the wait is never long. Everyone there is super friendly and accomidating. Servers are extremly nice. I LOVE THE FOOD. They have the best bisquit and gravy and an amazing eggs benedict!! Awesome place to go for Breakfast or Lunch!!"}
{"text":"Food is always hot and tasty.  Nicole took great care of us when we ate.  Service was quick with Nicole checking on us if we needed anything else.   I would recommend the restaurant anytime for breakfast.   Go Patriots."}
{"text":"Yesterday morning we had breakfast here and it was very good. I ordered the bacon, avocado and cheddar omelet with their breakfast potatoes and my husband ordered the taco skillet. My meal was great, but my breakfast potatoes for a bit over season. Don't get me wrong it was still good just a little warning if you don't like too much seasoning, you may want to order something other than the breakfast potatoes. My omelette was amazing, and it was filled with avocado. Our waiter was Hector and he was very friendly."}
{"text":"Extremely impressed with the service! I'm on a diet and have to change my order around and the waitresses were very helpful with suggestions and very understanding! I came here last week and am back again this week. There's a Groupon for this one :) which is a plus!"}
{"text":"They deserve 10stars! Food is delicious!  Service is fantastic... Tina our server was Amazing!"}
{"text":"Love the breakfast. Candice thanks for the great service  You Rock! Emerald Diamond cut style."}
{"text":"Veronica is the best waitress ever! Always professional and with a smile on her face. Food was awesome as usual!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and I was pleased both times. The food is excellent. The first time I got a breakfast skillet and the second time I got eggs benedict. The skillet was amazing but I thought the ham on the eggs benedict was a little chewy. Our server this last time was great. He was really on it, I wish I remembered his name. The portions are huge, big enough to share. It gets pretty crowed and can be a little noisy. Both times I've had to wait for a table but it's worth the wait.   You can usually find a coupon in some of the tourist books. I've also seen it on groupon."}
{"text":"Food and service were great if you can ask to sit in Diana's Nixx section you will get a worm cheery welcome and wonderful service the Stromboli is great"}
{"text":"I am a regular here, and I am sorry to say that this place is slowly going down hill fast! The food is okay, but the service is awful. When you ask for toast well done and you get stale bread, the server should not serve it to you. I don't know what has changed, but I will no longer be a regular there."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast spot that is always busy. Usually go here after church on Sundays and it's always packed but we usually get sat in 20 mins. I absolutely love their banana nut muffin! I've ordered several benedicts and omlettes and all have been pretty delicious ... but then again I love breakfast! They have a large menu to choose from and I love that you can make save calories with any order by substituting for egg whites, fruit, extra protein, or cottage cheese. I don't usually love chain restaurants but I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great cabo breakfast burrito. All breakfast burritos should have sauce and cheese on top. Candace gave us great service."}
{"text":"I got the waffle works - waffles were dry, the eggs were super bland, and the bacon was stringy. The help looked and acted like their souls were sucked out of them."}
{"text":"Eggcelent..lol. First time we tried here and we are hooked. Portions are huge and service was amazing. Our server Candice was really prompt and she explained the menu thoroughly for us...I used my check in for the banana nut muffin and it was Good! Definitely we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite breakfast place in the area. I usually go with the French toast works. It's hard to mess that up I know but I love their French toast and the syrup they use. You can really tell the difference in their syrup. Not overly sweet, but just good syrup. The wait time isn't usually too bad and their service is excellent. It can get pretty busy in there sometimes, but well worth it. They never have let me down! Guaranteed you can take family there and don't have to be worried they might serve bad quality food. Keep it up egg works!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a lot on their menu so there's something for everyone. My personal favorite is the the original eggs Benedict, it's good. Their potatoes are so good too. It does get busy around 9-12am so come early!"}
{"text":"Egg works is by far one of my favorite breakfast places to go to. Not to mention it's my favorite meal of the day:) I am in love with their banana nut muffin and potatoes!! The coffee is delicious and can go through an entire pot myself ahaha! If you need anything all you have to do is flip the smiley face to the sad face side and someone will be there to assist you in seconds. I've always had great customer service and enjoy my experience every time I go."}
{"text":"Took awhile to get drinks but once they did, he felt bad and gave us another muffin. Yumm on the artichoke omlet."}
{"text":"My favorite egg place in the neighborhood. Not dennys nor ihop not the buffet places. Of course they wont be called egg works for nothing...go try and see what one is missing. Service is good. Waiting time was not bad. Ambiance is not cluttered and boisterous. If one like the sound of train...there is one minitrain above running . Only thing this joint closes at 3 pm!!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, was recommended by our hotel as a great breakfast spot and did not disappoint. Donna was fantastic!"}
{"text":"It was a solid restaurant. good old fashioned hearty, simple food done well. Service was solid and a good , overall experience."}
{"text":"Aaaaaamazing service from Tehani :). Delicious food.  Had a great Father's Day brunch.  Banana nut muffins are the best!   We will definitely be back.   Had to take away a star because we think they should have had a manager walk around and check on tables. It was a very busy day and a little extra staff roaming around filling drinks and handling out extra napkins, etc., would have been great."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on Saturday June 7 2014. The wait was short got in pretty quick important to me as I had my grandkids with me . Our server was Nancy she was friendly and knew the menu well. Food was plenty and the banana nut muffins were awesome. Will return again and would recommend this place form a meal anytime."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, plenty of parking, friendly waitresses.  Large food menu with big portions.  I had a half portion vegetable omelette with fresh fruit and it was very tasty.  This is my new breakfast/lunch place."}
{"text":"PK our server is wonderful. He's super nice and on top of everything and will sing \"Somewhere over the Rainbow\" on request.   The food is amazing, never disappointed  my favorite order is the half order of Veggie Benny. Thank goodness half orders are a thing, because I wouldn't be able to finish a full order. Servings here are huge!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with big portions.   Their banana nut muffins are awesome.  Will definitely eat here again when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My husband and I come here at least twice a month. I absolutely love the the potato seasoning. The coffee is excellent. I love that they leave a pot of coffee at every table, you will never have an empty cup and if there's anything you need, you don't have to spend 5 minutes hoping your waitress will walk by your table, you just have to flip the egg at your table and it never takes longer than a minute for someone to appear. The staff is awesome with their customer service, especially Maegan. She remembers us every time she's our server and normal order. She is so sweet and I couldn't ask for better customer service. Give her a raise, she deserves it!"}
{"text":"Really great food with an extensive menu. Service was very good and I will make it a point to eat there when I am in town!"}
{"text":"OK...there comes a time when you must have an Intervention with those you love. I guess its no different with the restaurant you love...and so its time for an Intervention.   No one...NO ONE likes your \"works\" potatoes, frozen premanufactured potatoes which are then fat fried and over seasoned...yuck. And then offering a substitute of McDonald's hashbrowns...or rice?  Good breakfast restaurants always have GREAT potatoes...please, PLEASE take a look at this!  You know what...we just decided between this and the \"big\" pancake policy - we are just going to find another breakfast spot that gets it. Good luck to you and your crappie potatoes!  BTW...nothing to do with the servers...they have always been stellar."}
{"text":"This place is insane (in the best way). A coworker and I were craving eggs after a meeting and found this place on Yelp - hooray! First off, the portions were huge. I wasn't aware that they offer half sizes, so I could only eat about a third of my meal.  No complaints there though! The variety of dishes offered was fantastic. No matter what you're looking for or craving, this place will hit the spot.   I got the Works Skillet and my coworker had the Works Omelette. My skillet was fantastic and, like I mentioned above, huge. The potatoes were hands-down the best part of the meal. My coworker liked his omelette and said the banana nut muffin was great as well   My only complaint is that everything was a tad too salty. I'm fine with some extra salt, but when the butter on my toast is too salty, then it's a little bit of a letdown."}
{"text":"Waited at the front desk to be seed and was ignored. Another guest came and was seated immediately. We left and will not be back. The CRACKED EGG right up the road has superior food and service - they are highly recommended. Only gave Egg Works one star because I couldn't give zero."}
{"text":"First off, I wouldn't consider myself the least bit an early-riser (well, not for breakfast anyways).  I was here at 6:30 in the morn, lacking sleep, and I am still able to recall the killer breakfast at this place.  I honestly didn't even know this Egg Works had a location on Sunset (even though it has been there forever), but I'm glad I stopped in.  I needed to make a stop to the airport and breakfast prior to doing so just seemed like a good idea. I'll probably never see this place that early in the morning again though.  So being 6:30 in the am, I figured the place would be desolate, but I was taken by surprise when I entered and saw 3 other parties grubbing on some Egg Works offerings.  Okay, 3 parties isn't much, but seriously... it's 6:30!  That was a good indicator that this place means business.  After people-watching while waiting for my juice to be freshly squeezed from their orange tree that is growing within the walls of their kitchen (seriously it took a minute, but maybe I'm just not as patient during this hour), i noticed that the 3 other parties were regulars.  Regulars equals good service!    Our waitress was very helpful and even made mention of her picks on the menu.  I ended up going with the Haole Moco, which is an Americanized version of the ever-so-popular Hawaiian Loco Moco. Nice!  Pros: * good portion sizes... I even had to take some to go * okay so no Orange Tree in the kitchen to my knowledge, but it was fresh * open early for you early-risers (or late sleepers). * good service  Cons: * service can be a bit slow at times due to small talk w/ regulars  Tips:   They have this little flippy-thing that doubles as a salt/pepper shaker holder.  You can flip over to a different color, which indicates to the waitress that you are in need of assistance.  Pretty nifty.  I'll be honest, I just stared at it for a good minute or two, but since there were obstructions and I was entering the beginning stages of my food-coma, I said forget it and just waited for an opportunity to make eye-contact with the waitress to get the bill.  Seems pretty cool though. I'll try it next time I go and let you know if the waitress actually sees it in a timely manner.    One more tip, look up and watch the news.  It's more informative than people-watching, but I can't say it's more fun."}
{"text":"Country Fried Skillet!!! Yummy!!! And it comes in a half size!"}
{"text":"breakfast with large portions. great spot off the strip."}
{"text":"Food was great! Our server, Candice, provided excellent service throughout our experience. We're new to the area, and she's a big reason why we're going to be making frequent trips here. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast. The spicy breakfast potatoes are killer. The coffee is great and the staff very friendly and hard-working."}
{"text":"Egg Works has become my go-to place for breakfast when I don't wish to stray far from my neighborhood. The interior is reminiscent of a greasy spoon with dark and uninspiring bland colors. The ambience doesn't do much to perk one's appetite and mood during breakfast.   On the condiment tray, there's a smiley egg and a frowny egg graphic that indicates whether or not you require more service. A.k.a, get their attention. The service can be friendly or you can also end up with a snooty waitress that tells you they don't do the frowning egg anymore. Well, why do you put it on the table then?  Can't give an opinion on their lunch items but their omelettes are pretty good. Overall, the food is decent and the banana muffin that comes with some meals will be bringing you back."}
{"text":"The best place for breakfast and lunch. My favorite is egg Benedict pizza, delicious  Great service every time. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Service was oddly slow today, but the food is always, I say again, always amazing. They have a really cool concept going here. Each table features a little egg that yellow on one side with a sad face or black on the other with a happy face. A sad egg and everyone stops what they are doing and jumps at the opportunity to fix the situation. Sometimes i flip the egg just see what will happen :)   I prefer the omelets and sausage links. The coffee isn't the best so I say go with some juice or something else like that instead. I had the biscuits and gravy with some scrambled eggs and sausage patties. The patties were kinda dry which was a total shock. The potatoes that they serve are simply the best breakfast potatoes money can buy. Honestly thats what bumped them up to 4 stars from 3.   The location is pretty busy but they get tables cleared out fairly quick. I have never had to wait too long. If your in the mood for some good breakfast anytime of the day this is definitely your spot."}
{"text":"We had never been to an Egg Works before and today was an experience that ensures we will be back! The food was wonderful and our server, Mario, was excellent! His service was quick, he was very polite and helpful, and kept us laughing. Thank you Mario for making this a great first experience!"}
{"text":"Had no clue this place was a sister to egg and I, but it was in the right location and had what we where looking for. The Mexican omelette was very good, I got to substituent once again the stuff to make it a little healthier, the sauce they put over it was extremely good definitely made the omelette on this one. Service was good minus the waitresses forgetting our drinks but at least I got my coffee. They where very busy but the wait was less than 15 minutes, price was about average for the food and area. Fast turn around and food service."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite breakfast spot and the last few times the food has been terrible. I ordered the veggie skillet and it was pretty much season potatoes with two leaves of spinach and two eggs, it's impossible to eat a whole skillet of  seasoned potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the Pancho scrambled and it was almost worse than mine, the chicken was dry there was no rice as it stated on the menu and no eggs,it was mostly potatoes as well . We came a late around 1 pm and it seems like they ran out of fresh food and just tried to fill out plates with potatoes. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot ever , delicious food and many choices. The service is amazing and our server Robert at the Anthem location was so fast and attentive."}
{"text":"Our server Christopher is friendly and quick with the service. Definitely coming back here again!  The food was delicious and good portion to share!  Came hungry and now leaving with an extremely full tummy."}
{"text":"Love the gumbolaya. Jennifer was our server and was awesome! She made sure we were taking care of and has a great personality. She made our morning. Would come back for more of the awesome breakfast!"}
{"text":"Kelli was awesome!!! Food came about perfect and absolutely delicious. I usually get the Chile Relleno Omelet or the Country Fried Steak Skillet. Mike got the Corned Beef Hash which was also really good! Wen I checked in on Yelp I got a free muffin, which was great! All the staff here is super friendly and helpful when it comes to needing anything at all!   We will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"After multiple friends suggested a stop here ...well I had to!  The restaurant is very clean and although it wasn't too busy the first place they tried to sit me was off to the side.  I asked to sit somewhere else because the gentleman there looked very out of place.   Maybe he was eccentric but he looked homeless.  They immediately obliged my request and sat me in the middle.     My friends had asked me to bring them take out banana nut muffins.   So I ordered a few of those to go.  I ordered the Three Little Pigs omelette to dine there with my muffin.    The omelette was tasty but nothing to equal the raves my friends gave me of the place.  The muffin was also tasty but nothing I had to get again or ask someone to bring me.    My friends told me to order a Benedict the next time I visit.  We shall see but I wasn't too enthralled about this visit to make me savor coming back."}
{"text":"This place is one of our favs in Vegas! They are really kid friendly and great food. The coffee is just ok sorta like water down brown water, but the food and staff make up for that! Our server Nicole E was awesome! Great attention to our needs, thank you!"}
{"text":"We love breakfast food and eggworks does not disappoint! The portions are huge and the service is great. Alexa took great care of us!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Service ok.  But food is great!  Waitress needed a Red Bull.  I had an omelette with bacon.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Short Version: Best hangover remedy ever.  Long Version: If you're in Vegas and have been partying, you owe it to yourself to come here and make everything alright again. Even if you haven't been pounding alcohol, this place is one of the best breakfast / lunch restaurants I've visited. The staff is friendly, the menu is huge and the food is really good. In fact, you owe it to yourself to at least try it once. If you do, you are treated to extra food for free just for coming in as a first time customer. The prices are more than fair, the quality of the food is high and there's even abundant parking.  Come on, stop by and try it. It'll be egg-actly what you need.  See what I did there?  Check'em out!"}
{"text":"If you're going to go here, expect to wait a little while. The weight is probably worth it though if you're into breakfast foods. I genuinely enjoyed it, just a bit loud for my taste."}
{"text":"Donna was our server when we ate this morning. She was so pleasant and her service was wonderful. The food was great too. AND she looked like Skylar from Breaking Bad. Love it!"}
{"text":"Looking for a good eggs benedict the high reviews for this restaurant led me wildly astray.  The service was attentive... I even liked the \"egg signals\" for when you need something. However. the food was horrible. The worst eggs benedict I can remember. The hollandaise space was lacking in flavor and since it was served in a deep dish filled with the sauce it turned the english muffins into a soggy mess. The canadian bacon was obviously cut rate ham. All in all a lackluster preparation with poor quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Our server Merissa was really sweet and accommodating when there was a problem with my food. Will always come back."}
{"text":"Food was yummy! Omelettes are big and service was great! Thank you Veronica! Hope you get to go to Disney!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Service ! Make sure you ask for Raul as the server always on point with order friendly great customer service and food is fresh and hot just like I like my food."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever. This place totally surpassed my expectations.  Just a quick google search and we were off the strip and a few (7) miles later we're at Eggworks.  This place is cute, it feels like you're in a log cabin.  The staff is super prompt. Whenever you needed your waitress, you flip this metal egg at your table from a smiley egg to a frowny egg and someone comes running!  But more importantly, the price, and the food. I think the costs were reasonable.  I believe I ordered an eggwhite veggie omelette (came with a side of fruit and banana nut muffin/hash or potatoes). I opted for the muffin (splendid!!!). I also ordered a side of the turkey sausage (pumped they even had turkey sausage), an apple danish, hot tea, cranberry juice....and i think that's it, lol.  I did take the pastries to go, so dont judge me too much.  all the food was great. the table came with a variety of hot sauce (which is a must for me). i recommend the good ole Cholula.  They had something they must make called Habla Diablo or something (see my pics) which was just plain heat. Didnt care for it.    The fruit was delicious. Every piece was excellent, and I'm pretty picky about fruit.  Eggs were great, just enough cheese on top.  My only complaint was that the tomato in the omelette made it wetter than i'd prefer.  I really dont need to write anymore since i loved every bite. My peeps got the potatoes which were also great.  I think for my entire order it was $25, tops.  Totally worth it considering I ordered so much!  DEFINITELY GO HERE. Especially if you love breakfast."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars 'cuz it's the BOMB! The banana nut muffin is amazing - a fresh, warm muffin of yumminess! I lucked out by mentioning that I wanted eggs and sausage with my pancakes and it turned out they actually have that breakfast combo, but it's just not listed on the menu. If you like sausage, I suggest the links over the patty.  And if you're a coffee drinker like me, you'll appreciate the carafe of coffee they leave for you on the table and the flavored creamers in addition to just the regular creamer! And they have plenty of healthy choice options you too.  It turns out that our waitress Rachelle was new and was still being trained. She was awesome! Very friendly and attentive! She did a great job!! We actually thought she was training the guy who was helping her .  We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"First i have to say that the food is just perfect the design of it and the taste. The place is very cozy and a welcoming environment its our second time being here and we came back because the good feeling that the waitress gave us. This time we had the pleasure to have veronica as our server and she was the best of all.. I really wish that i would get this good feeling every where i go to eat.. She made the food experience much better and like i said before the food is all ready good so it just made it to perfect.. I really cant remember the last time i sat in a place while smiling throughout the whole meal!"}
{"text":"Holy Cow! Top 3 breakfast experiences ever! I got the chicken enchilada omelette.  Get it! Even have raisin bread toast! Everyone was so nice, we actually felt like royalty! Jayna was absolutely fabulous!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everyone is so nice. And it's a great way to start the weekend :) Uvvvv, how about those banana nut muffins???"}
{"text":"Always busy and worth the wait-though we usually sneak up to the counter and eat with Shantel. Order the Fiesta Skillet!  And, the best part, you can get 1/2 orders on all the skillets!  They are huge!"}
{"text":"What an eggs-ceptional experience!!   See what I did there?? Huh?? See that??  Everybody who knows me know I love breakfast foods and love eggs especially!  A coworker of mine kept telling me that I had to check this place out. \"You can't go wrong here, Mike.\" \" You'll love it, Mike.\" \" This has you name written all over it, Mike.\"  Damn, they were so right!  Egg Works is located right next to a McDonald's on the east side of Rainbow just south of the 215 freeway. As we pull into the parking lot this morning, first thing we take note of is that it is crowded as hell! There were no spaces actually at Egg Works, so we actually had to park behind McDonald's. Good news is that speaks volumes as to their reputation. On the flip side, how long is it going to take to get seated and how long until we actually get to devour some grub! We parked and figured we'd give it a shot.  We literally did not have to wait at all! A couple entered right before us and no sooner did they enter the door, a hostess was escorting them to a table. Just as soon as they took off before us another hostess appeared and walked us to our table. Wow! That was seamless!   Sitting at our table, we noticed the healthy portions of food at the other diners tables. This was starting to look promising! Our waitress appeared and took our drink order. We had our drinks within maybe 3 minutes of walking through the door!   After giving us a few minutes to make a selection, our waitress took our order and was off again. We noticed this place had a ton of people taking to-go orders with them. This place is wildly popular and I can't believe I'm just discovering this now!  When our waitress returned with our food, she actually apologized for the wait! We just looked at each other and laughed since it was literally less than 10 minutes from the time we ordered.   Wasn't exactly what to try first, but I love me a good cheese omelette, so I figured that was a safe bet. The cheese was so much tastier here than at some other breakfast places I frequent. The dish came with 4 slices of buttered toast and seasoned hash brown nuggets. Very tasty! My friend opted for the Denver omelette and raved about his, as well.  On our next visit(which is a foregone conclusion), we agreed to try one of those skillets. Those things looked powerful good!  I'm also digging the little system they have set up with the happy egg/sad egg. If you are pleased with everything and want to be left to enjoy your food, just keep the happy egg up. If you need something or need to speak to somebody, just flip it to the sad egg. We only used this once to get a drink refil, and it only took about 15 seconds for someone to take care of the issue. This was impressive considering how packed the place was at the time!  This place is freaking awesome and we will be back. A lot. And often. And again. And you get the point.  Spoiler Alert: Mike F. will be checking in to this place a lot!  5 stars."}

{"text":"Very nice and accommodating restaurant. There was a slight wait, waited about 10-15 mins. Donna was our server. She was very nice and attentive. Great service! Food was also good, and generous portions. Order the Stuffed French Toast if you're a french toast fan. Don't forget to check in on yelp for a free banana nut muffin. :)"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. Eggs all styles. Omelettes. In skillet. Benedict. Good service. A number of places in Vegas."}
{"text":"The mashed potato omelette is amazing and the kids love the decor of the train. Four stars because our waiter forgot a few things we asked for, but he was still very friendly!"}
{"text":"This is the most amazing breakfast food I've ever had. Lunch is amazing too!  It's delicious. I've eaten in and taken out... no matter what the food is cooked to your liking and made with the freshest ingredients. Service is spectacular, especially for such a busy place. You won't be disappointed - make sure you try this place out!!"}
{"text":"Food was good,but seriously I pay $10 for pancake,eggs,and only 2 slice of bacon.not worth $10:("}
{"text":"Food was amazing and Candice was our waitress, she was very helpful and nice! Biscuits and gravy were absolutely amazing. Eggs were wonderful as well and even the hablo Diablo potatoes were great as well ( a little spicy)."}
{"text":"The Egg Works has something for everyone.  We received eggcellent service from our server CAITLIN.  From the moment we sat down til the moment we left, she took very good care of us.  We literally placed our order and it was on our table within ten minutes.  On top of everything else, it was delicious.  I had the Vegas style omelette.  YUM. Then I took my banana nut muffin home with me.  Come here for great service and Eggcellent food.   I can't show any pictures of my food because it's all gone.  Melody Peach Jamestown, NY"}
{"text":"Great place to go when you want a nice easy breakfast( or whatever your in the mood for they have a big menu) . It is not very upperclass but they get the job done. This place is very relax and always have Groupon specials. I have a number of allergies and they always make sure that none of them are in my food. The only I want to say is that on weekend morning they are packed but you won't wait more than 5 min for a table. A good place with nice people and good smart staff."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! There are so many options on the menu that it's very difficult to decide what sounds best. Today our group waited about 15 minutes to be seated, it was a busy Sunday morning. Our selections ranged from country fried steak to pork chops, chili omelets and fresh waffles. I chose the strawberry cream cheese filled French toast. It was tasty, but SUPER sweet. If you want to crossover dessert into breakfast, this is for you. Overall though it was berry good (sorry- had to.) Though it was busy, the staff worked together and made sure nothing was missing during our entire meal. The friendly atmosphere and creative breakfast menu make it a great place for anyone to enjoy.  The negative: it was really busy, and there was a rush to get people seated. That resulted in our table not being as clean as we would have preferred (there were used creamers and butter packets left at the table, and it could have used a wipe down. ) Other than that it was a good morning meal for my family."}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast place!  Banana muffin is perfect-not too sweet and lots of flavor. Server Nicole was really attentive."}
{"text":"I came here this morning with my family around 6:30am before catching my 9am flight at McCarran. I think this is the nearest place to the airport with decent breakfast that opens that opens before 7am.   We ordered: Country fried steak - My brother said the potatoes were a little too seasoned for his taste, but he still wiped his plate clean  Fresh Veggie Skillet - Got my eggs over easy so I could mix everything up. I got a banana nut muffin that came with the meal, but I just took a couple pinches of it because it didn't taste like banana nut at all. It tasted very plain and the appearance was a little strange. The bottom part was all small and the top was kind of flat with crispy edges. Imagine a small flap jack on top of a shot glass; that's what it looked like. I wish there were a little more veggies in the skillet besides the potatoes, which took up 75% of the skillet. The potatoes looked very seasoned, but they didn't taste overly salty or anything. All in all, it was okay, but I probably wouldn't order it again. I'll stick to an omelet next time because I know it'll have a lot more veggies.   Loco Moco (American version) - This was the American version, I believe. The gravy looked like the same gravy that was on the country fried steak my brother got and it made the dish taste just like it too. The only difference was that the Country Fried steak was served with potatoes and this was served over rice.   The Classic - Pretty basic meal, but my mom said it was good. I guess she assumed all of our meals were going to be pretty large so she could pick at them, which is the reason why she got that.   Of course, my mom was right. All of our meals were pretty big, but not overwhelming. My brother cleaned his plate, my mom left one over easy egg, my boyfriend had a small cup of rice left, and I had some potatoes left. The bill came out to $47, but I had a bogo entree coupon from the 2011 Entertainment book with an $8 value. I don't think there was a single entree below $8, but they took the $8 out of our bill, so it turned out to be $39. That's a pretty good deal if you ask me!  I'll come back here again if I want breakfast before a flight. They have a big sign out front that says they're open 6am-3pm, so I guess they just do breakfast and lunch. The airport is just a few turns away from this place so you don't have to worry about being late if you get here a couple hours before your flight."}
{"text":"Wow, loved this place.  If you can't find a dish to please your palate, you really didn't want to eat in the first place.  Our server Sarah was very attentive and if you need them before checking back the smiley face country cabin at your table gives you the opportunity to hail them. The real tip here is COME HUNGRY, as in the words of server Sarah, \"it's good but it's a lot\" -- I'll say I appreciate the high quality of the ingredients as well as the bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"[Review is solely for the awesome chili cheeseburger I chased down and captured here]:  When someone recommended Egg Works 2 as having one of the best cheeseburgers in town, I was dubious.  I mean, it's a breakfast place, right?  Who would ever order a burger when there are omelets and pancakes to be had?  But I went out on a limb and tried the Chili Cheeseburger that I was recommended.  Holy tastiness, Batman!  I almost licked the plate it was so good.  For those of you that haven't indulged in the sloppy mess that is the chili cheeseburger, let me tell you that the meal lives and dies on the quality of the chili.  Under the smothering tomato-meat sauce of a good chili, the burger patty becomes mere textural background.  But given the right chili--an amazing chili--that's not a bad thing.    And Egg Works 2 rightly deserves praise for its chili--which is cooked Cincinnati style.  Cincinnati chili is a little different than what you're probably used to.  It's made with some unusual ingredients (cinnamon, cloves, allspice or chocolate) and you won't find many chili peppers or chili powder in the sauce.  I was a little skeptical when I found out about the lack of chilies, but it's good, really good.  The Cincinnati-specific spices make the chili so much richer that you really don't miss the heat.  Order it with the works and you'll get gooey cheese and onions that make the burger a sloppy, brilliant mess.  The chili spills over the burger when you pick it up.  You'll need like 45 napkins.  But you won't care.    Man, it's a good burger.  I'd put it in the top 15 burgers in Vegas.  Why 15?  Well, I suspect there's nothing very interesting about the burger patty's taste under all that chili goodness.  But you won't even think of that while you're scooping every last bit of chili off the plate."}
{"text":"Visiting vegas my family and I checked out a lot of breakfast spots. ..this is by far my favorite . Bruce our waiter was amazing ! Ask for him!  Homemade banana nut muffins are a must."}
{"text":"The food we ordered was super salty .Skillet of heart stopper will truly give you a heart attack.The muffin was amazing but the food was full of sodium beyond consumption."}
{"text":"The banana nut muffin was sweet and not as warm as I remembered having it last time I was here. Service was speedy and efficient and had no need to use their happy sad egg face system.  We ordered the French toast which was fine. It came with apple sauce and syrup. I also got the Italian skillet which very good.  I remember the prime rib eddy was being awesome but my gf said had a weird slice she did not like so I opted for a skillet on the opinion of other yelpers."}
{"text":"First time here. Enjoyed the atmosphere. Great omelet selection. Service was good. Definitely a notch better than Denny's or IHOP."}
{"text":"Extremely happy with our experience. Seated immediately, served quickly and food was great. I wish I remembered the waitresses name but she was wonderful and the general manager was kind and nice without being overly involved. Highly recommend the scramblers, the half portion was plenty (I would have taken a picture but it was too good not to eat right away)."}
{"text":"Candice is a really nice server and totally should win the trip to Disneyland. Food was pretty good too."}
{"text":"First, let me say that this place was very crowded for a Monday. We are visiting from out of town and thought \"Great! It must be good.\" The restaurant itself was freezing cold. And it never changed, temperature wise. They had two hostess' and the one we dealt with first didn't take or name because she said \"your first, I've got you in my mind.\" Ok, sounds good.. it wasn't. She left and the other one returned and seated new people before us. The old one came back and was like \"OMG, I'm so sorry, your next.\" Then the second one came back and seated someone else again!!! We finally got seated and all was ok. The food was ok. Not great, not bad EXCEPT for the pancakes, which were hard. Yuck. Now it's time to pay. We stood in line and in front of us was a man with a Chihuahua on a leash. Yes, inside the restaurant. He had been sitting near us and was there when we got there, finished, but just sitting on his phone. The dog was terrified, and freezing too. Anyhow, at the cash register this man was yanking and pulling the dog.. I said she looks very afraid. He says yes, she's overwhelmed. My husband leans down and let's her sniff his hand and then she practically jumps into his arms. He gives her a little scratch on her back and the man turns around and says Don't pet her, she's a service dog. We said ok. Then he got belligerant with us and said I've got the papers if you don't believe me!!! Then the cashier pipes in, and says you should never pet a dog unless you ask first! I then say, we own a pet sitting business, we are familiar with animals and the guy got even more rude. The whole situation was ridiculous. The dog did not have a service vest and was clearly not a service animal. Poor pup. We felt sorry for her. My issue is with the cashier, Lacey. She had no business giving her opinion or intervening. She was VERY rude and then became very condescerning when I complained about her behavior. So, if your looking for a good meal with a pleasant experience GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. FYI, It's not an inexpensive place either. One star because you can't give zero."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat I love it! Sat outside on the patio our waiters name was Juan amazing waiter great service super kind , helped us with everything overall great experience !"}
{"text":"truly three stars.  huge menu, good variety of food, quick to be seated, large portions.   slowwww service (it took us nearly 10-15 minutes before someone even came over to say hi after being seated) and the taste of food was standard/expected for breakfast food.  nothing memorable about this place, but that wouldn't stop me from coming again."}
{"text":"My colleague and I come here for breakfast daily. The hostess and servers are extremely friendly and the food is always good. Sy, Travis, Blade (to name a few) are thoughtful and attentive servers. Thank you all for our wonderful experiences! Breakfast pushes us straight through our work day :)!"}
{"text":"Met old friends I hadn't seen in 35+ years at The Egg Works, our server Mario was nothing less than fantastic! He was spot on for all our needs and gracious with our crazy reminiscing while he was serving us.  Mario was awesome! Oh yes, the food was fantastic too!  I will definitely be a return customer when visiting next time!"}

{"text":"Great place to grab breakfast. The huevos ranchoes were amazing. Beat I've had in a long time. Did them with green sauce and scrabbled eggs. And a plus they have booze!!! With breakfast, OMG."}
{"text":"After a good work out why not go down the street and grab a bite. It was a Saturday around 11 and it was packed. Can't be upset about that tho, it's a breakfast place, it should be that way. We were seated in a tiny table in the corner waited for 10-15 before they came over and took our order. The waitress we had wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu. I knew that egg and I had booze just didn't know how much, after asking I was only shown half the menu and didn't find out til after my meal they had butterscotch schnapps. I order the huevos rancheros and didn't get any salsa. It usually comes with it so I just used the kind that was on the table.. Also was never asked if I wanted a refill on my milk or if I wanted anything else to drink. My friend order the cheese omelet and was pretty satisfied, just should have all the reviews first. She wanted to get the corn need hash but only likes canned, which they have but the waitress told us they didn't.. Maybe the gal was new but why not ask the chef or something. Just wasn't the best experience."}
{"text":"Another heavenly breakfast place.  Busy as hell on a Sunday.  :)  Everyone was quite satisfied.  Heaping portions of heavenly deliciousness.  Their potatoes are seasoned with paprika and something else I can't place, it makes them quite friggin tasty.  I wanted to pick off everyone's plate!!  I ordered the omelet with mashed potatoes in the middle and cheese.  Top that with banana bread.  I ate like I was feeding twins in my belly (I'm not).  Completely egg-gasmic.  I'd do it over and over again if I could."}
{"text":"I love coming here! Everything I have ordered has been great. The staff are super friendly and if you flip the egg sign over to unhappy someone will be at you table to fix whatever is in seconds. Don't forget to get the epoxy app so you can get stamps and free food!"}
{"text":"My first time here was yesterday morning, just popped in to see how the food was, and it didn't disappoint! I live in the area and have driven past this location a lot but never went in, I have been missing out for sure! The staff is friendly and attentive, the food was hot and quick, and I had a great breakfast. I will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"We love Egg works! One of our favorite breakfast places!   The banana nut muffins are delicious. The servers are always friendly too.   The mashed potato omelette is delicious. The original breakfast burrito is always really good. The stuffed French toast is absolutely amazing! We've tried a few other items as well and it's all so good!  We are always happy with our experience there and will continue to go back. It's always pretty busy there though so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"First and foremost......the BEST...... and I mean the BEST banana nut muffin I have ever had. Actually it was the BEST muffin I ever had.  When I took my first bite of it, I looked at my friend across the table and muttered, \"oh fuck\". I don't say those lovely words outside of the bedroom often but it was all I could say.   It was a heavenly experience.  There was 3 of us so we shared the blueberry stuffed french toast that was on special and the green chili omelet the waitress recommended. The omelet was a tad too salty. If you know me, then you know things can hardly be too salty for my taste but it just wasn't that good. The stuffed french toast however was great. The blueberries were plump and the syrup wasn't too sweet. Love the chewy consistency of the bread. Not gross like some over the top stuffed french toast but a well balance of sweetness, moistness and loveliness ( Yes, I'm still talking about food)The waitress was great since we were virgins to this place and was so very helpful.  The coffee was really good too.   The counter for paying was irritating though. The cashier is by the door so you get traffic coming in and going out.  Only 1 cashier and that can get really irritating especially when the place is busy. Overall....this is a great joint for breakfast and we will definitely be back on our trips out to Henderson/Vegas. It is worth the trip. :)"}
{"text":"The best banana nut muffin ever! And the food is just so good! :) I'd definitely recommend this place to everyone! Also had great service from Donna, she was super sweet and very attentive!"}
{"text":"We eat breakfast here every weekend.  Our Server Jennifer is fantastic.  It's a great start of a day when we see her.  She goes out of her way."}
{"text":"Robert has made this experience one of a kind!! My friend and I came to grab a quick and easy bite and we ended up with a few laughs and great memories! Definitely coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"The food here is barely a step above Denny's but that is kind of what I was expecting and was not all that shocked. The service was OK, yes just OK; a couple of things were forgotten by the server.  I could probably give this place a 2 or 3 star rating but on my visit I chose to sit on their patio since it was a nice morning.  Well, this establishment chooses to allow their patrons to sit at their tables and chain smoke...before, during and after their meals! WTF is up with that? Isn't it now law that smoking is banned within X amount of feet of the door AND where food is being served/consumed?  I'm not sure who is more to blame; the owner for allowing this or the idiotic patrons that can't put down their nicotine sticks for one god damned meal!  I mean really, you need to be holding a smoke in one hand and a fork in another!?!?!? I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Cool, nice and busy place. We have had breakfast here once and like it. The food was good and we enjoyed ourselves. I love biscuits and gravy, so when I ordered some, it was fair. The ambience was relaxing. We love to eat and feel good, this place was good. Having it been our first time, we had a good brunch."}
{"text":"Consistent quality. Great service and even when they have a wait, the line moves quickly. Don't miss the banana muffins."}
{"text":"I get the sense that your experience with this place will depend on what you order.  I personally ordered the banana pancakes and asked the waitress if the pancakes were \"mixed in\" the batter. She said yes, but I guess I should have asked if they were mashed.  When they came to the table it was slices of banana within the cake, however underneath the banana was uncooked batter.  So eating around that part the pancakes were just \"OK\".  I did however taste my friends banana bread french toast and it was really good!  if the waitress wasn't trying to rush us out of there and I would have ordered his dish, I would give this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"Jamie our server was very friendly and service was fast. The homemade banana nut muffin came out warm and was delicious! Even my husbands toast was better than the standard toast (the melted butter was delicious). The potatoes that seem to be their thing was just ok. The prices for our egg dishes were a little steep but our tongues were satisfied!"}
{"text":"There are Egg Works all over the city, which is great! We have always had good meals here.It is great for brunch, or lunch.  This is not a fancy place! It is good classic breakfast! YUM! It is one of our go-to spots when we have friends in, or want some good, affordable comfort food."}
{"text":"The service here is always 5 stars for sure. The food is a solid 3.5. Average out to a 4.  This is a perfect place to bring a gaggle for some comfort food. Not fancy, not pretentious, just good ol' diner food.  Service, more than food keeps me coming back. Always a smiling staff, prompt to the table, drinks and food there really quickly. And never an issue."}
{"text":"A good, solid breakfast joint (and lunch if you're feeling that kind of way) that's perpetually busy and now I know why.  My husband and I had a rare weekday off together and we decided to try this place out (finally!). It was a Thursday around 10am and while we didn't have to wait for a table, it was surprisingly busy. We were sat at a small table just off the bar area and our server, Austin, was outstanding. My husband told him it was our first time there and asked for suggestions and he immediately whizzed off to get us some complimentary banana muffins. Heaven in a muffin tin, people! And that damn butter! Grassland Dairy, where are you? Where can I find your butter for sale? So freaking good! I'll say it again-so. freaking. good. I need you Grassland butter!  My husband opted for a breakfast skillet and I had the spinach eggs Benedict. Husband was super happy and his skillet was HUGE and had everything he wanted. Potatoes (more on those later but mmmmmm!), eggs, ham, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms and cheese (and really, I may be missing a few items cause there was just SO much packed into that thing!). It came with a side of toast and again, that BUTTER!  My spinach eggs Benedict was...well, it was ok. The eggs were poached perfectly and the English muffins didn't get soggy, which is almost impossible with a bennie so mad props for that. I did take issue, however, with a couple of the main parts of the it. The ham was way too salty for my liking and the hollandaise sauce was, well, just ok.  It's not that it was bad, just kind of bland. The potatoes, however, were to die for. Chopped up into bite sized pieces and lightly seasoned. No need for ketchup or any dipping sauce with these spuds-they stood up deliciously by themselves. The orange juice (which they say is fresh squeezed) cost a mint. $2.95 a glass with no refills. Save some dough and forgo the OJ in place of something less expensive.  The service was second to none. We were greeted and seated immediately. Our server was incredibly friendly and easy going. Our order was taken quickly and accurately and despite the restaurant being busy our meals came out pretty quickly.  I recommend Eggworks to everyone at least once! It's easy to see why they're approaching a cult following status."}
{"text":"I hope this is the right one, so many to choose from and I am a visitor....  We got a Groupon to try here while we were visiting over Thanksgiving.  I got the Cincy Chili Dog and a salad with ranch.  I didn't like the Cincy dog at all, had a couple bites and gave up.  The ranch dressing for the salad wasn't made right so they offered me a new one with freshly made dressing but we had to go so they gave us four (enough for everyone I was with) of the banana nut breads, which were pretty good.  Even though the food wasn't that good, they got five stars for service and I would be willing to go back to try something else.  My mom liked her chicken salad sandwich, my sister loved her BLT but my son says he didn't really like the tuna melt, even though he took the rest of it to go."}
{"text":"This place has become my go-to breakfast option. LOVE LOVE LOVE everything here. Never had a bad experience and hope I never do. Have tried so many different things and everything is AMAZING. if you're a fan of banana nut, the fresh made banana nut muffins are TO DIE FOR. LITERALLY."}
{"text":"Brigitte gave us great and quick service for breakfast this morning. Really enjoyed my French dip and my son loved his three pigs omelette. I will go back for lunch because they serve pizzas now."}
{"text":"Marianne was our server & boy was she great! She helped us navigate through our menu & suggested I should get the Veggie Benny with bacon. My sister in law got the soup of the day (which our server also suggested) & thoroughly enjoyed it. My nieces got grilled cheese, fruit, & spaghetti off the kids' menu. Portion sides exceeded my exceptions. We came hungry, ate, & ended up leaving full with leftovers! The decor of the place was awesome. My nieces favorite part was the trains going by. Food, service, decor? Awesome!"}
{"text":"This place knows what there doing. Everything on the menu is great. Staff is excellent and service is fast. They don't have alcohol but that's ok. This place is a must for us in Vegas."}
{"text":"Seriously obsessed with this place now. My boyfriend and I ate here this morning after wanting to try this place for forever! I got the mexican omelet and he got the chili omelet, with the works chili. All I can say is: YUM. First of all, these are not normal omelets...they are massively huge! They come with breakfast potatoes smothered in old bay spice and either a muffin, toast, or bagel of your choice. The portions are seriously outrageous and the prices are decent. Not to mention, I loved the feel of this restaurant. The atmosphere is cute, the service is great and friendly, and everyone seems to be in a good mood. We will definitely be back here soon!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and always get friendly, fast service. I always have modifications to my order, due to dietary restrictions and they never make me feel high maintenance. Donna was my most recent server and she was a pleasure! Very energetic and helpful."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something other than the chain breakfast restaurants that are around the city and I've heard a lot of great things about this place. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. The prices are reasonable and the portions are big! We didn't wait too long for our meals to arrive. Will come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"This egg works for me!  Came here on a whim when a bad case of the \"brunchies\" hit my GF and I. This place was packed! I mean, it was Saturday at around 12:30pm, but OMGEEE! Thankfully we weren't a family of seven and were promptly seated.   Egg works has this weird system in place to make sure you're always getting fed or refilled. You do get an official server for your table, but there's also these yellow and black eggs placed on stands on each table. When you need something, you flip the egg over and show the yellow egg with a sad face, this tells other servers, \"help, I need more coffee!\". The black egg face indicates that everything is egg-xactly fine. I tried this and yes it works, like a moth to a flame.  Like I said earlier, this is a family place and there were kids everywhere. Normally that's my cue to eat somewhere else, but I decided to deal with it via a bloody mary. I wasn't expecting much of a bloody mary from a place called \"Egg Works\", but this tasted like pure tomato juice. Not sure if there was any vodka even in it. Definitely pass on this if you find your hungover self here, but whateves, I'm here for the eggs.   I started my meal with a banana nut muffin that my GF and I shared. This was very good, super moist, soft, and just the right amount of sweet. I could have easily eaten another one, but I wanted to save room for B-Fast burrito coming my way. I got the Santa Cruz burrito. This isn't on their website menu, but it's pretty much the Cabo Burrito except with chicken added. This was very hearty and tasty; the tortilla was soft and warm, the chicken/egg combo was very cohesive, and the sauce they drench on top was full of flavor. This burrito did lack some spice, but I was able to remedy that with the tableside hot sauces they provide, which I found out they make in house. This was plenty of food for one person and a great way to ensure that a mid-afternoon nap would be in my future.   Egg Works wasn't my favorite place and honestly I don't see myself coming back here soon, but it did do the trick for that case of the \"brucnhies\". Eat on my friends."}
{"text":"I went to Egg Works for the first time a few months ago and I just didn't care for the flavor at all, plus our food was cold but since this place has so many amazing reviews, I decided to wait for a review till I tried them one more time. It took me a few months but I just recently went back and now I totally understand the hype! Great prices, good flavor and portions and many locations.  I decided to go with the Chicken Fried Steak since I'm not an omelet fan and my boyfriend went with the Waffle Works. So I'm a little weird with scrambled eggs, I like them slightly undercooked if that makes sense. I always thought places made them so rubbery and dry but this place makes them perfectly the way I like them! Soft and fluffy but not watery or rubbery. Their seasoned potatoes were also pretty addictive and the gravy on the Chicken Fried Steak was seasoned perfectly and had the perfect texture. One thing that made me really happy, the breading didn't slide off the steak! Whoo! My boyfriend's waffle was also nice and sweet with soft chewiness and I liked that they offered sausage patties. We also both checked in on Yelp to get 1 free Banana Nut Muffin each!!! Awesome! So warm and flavorful! Our server was also great and had a good sense of humor, she made us laugh a few times.  Overall, Egg Works doesn't offer any crazy menu items but simple can definitely be better if executed right. Also, there are soo many different options to choose from! Benedicts, Omelets, Pancakes, Waffles, Scrambles, Skillets, Sandwiches, Crepes, Salads, Soups, Burgers, even Enchiladas, Burritos, and Spaghetti! Basically, if you're looking to have breakfast with even the pickiest of eaters, they'll find something they like here!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new breakfast spot this morning that was close to my house and thanks to all you yelpers, I found that egg works was near by and had a good rating.  The outside of the building appears as if it would be a poor quality restaurant inside but I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in.  The ambience was high energy (as a busy breakfast spot usually is).  I called in advance and put my name on the list and they seated me almost immediately.    The service was excellent.  Wait staff was very prompt and friendly.  I ordered a breakfast burrito and my wife got steak and eggs (we always split our two meals).  Both dishes were amazing.  The steak was extremely tender and served with egg whites on the side (per our request).  The breakfast burrito was a 10/10, filled with eggs, peppers, bacon, and sausage.    The most impressive part of eggs works was their home made salsa!  It was actually so good that I bought a jar upfront (very reasonably priced at 4 dollars.    I'm very impressed with egg works and will probably go back sometime this week."}
{"text":"We were in the area on business and were looking for a breakfast spot.  Saw the Egg Works had good Yelp reviews and decided to give it a try.  They have a pretty extensive menu from omelettes to crepes to French toast.  Food was really good and portions were generous, prices were very reasonable as well.  Best part was the fantastic service, our server Danielle (Dani) was very polite and attentive.  Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"No surprise  this place was voted #1 in Vegas! Excellent service by our waitress Donna, who was very attentive with a smile.   Food was excellent: Santa Fe skillet and avocado beacon omelette. Served to perfection. Thanks egg works for a great breakfast and thank you Donna for the wonderful service.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been dining at egg works for a very long time now, at only this location. I'd say close to 10 times. I think it's time that I finally write a review of this place. Recently, my experiences at egg works have been very disappointing. I think one of the reasons is because of how big this company is getting. I believe it's falling into a classic company downfall where the company is sacrificing quality/consistency/customer satisfaction while expanding as a whole.  My last experience will probably keep me from coming into this restaurant again. I don't eat pork, religiously. Neither does my girlfriend for personal reasons. Anyway, the last 4 times I've eaten here, we've found bacon/ham in our food. For me, it's come three times in my Chicken/mushroom/spinach skillet. And for my girl, its come once in her VEGGIE omelet. It happens once, maybe twice, no big deal. But it happening a total of 4 times is a little ridiculous. Yesterday, (10/14/2012), it happened again. I'm not the type of person who sends things back or gets fussy about things, so I informed my server, picked the ham out, and continued to eat my meal. (after the server asked to redo the dish, but who wants to sit and wait while everyone around them is eating) My girlfriend, who got the egg white veggie omelet, ate all around the edges of her omelet because the inside was so under done that it was mostly all liquid inside. We also got one of their pumpkin pancakes, but that also was underdone in the middle.  After all of the things that have gone wrong with this meal and informing our polite server about them (while we weren't assholes or fussy about our meal) we got no attention from the restaurant manager. I'm sorry, but you just served someone pork, someone who doesn't eat pork for religious reasons, and you don't apologize for your kitchens mistake? Nor apologize for the simple cooking mistakes made through out the entire meal? Naturally, nothing was taken off the bill. Not even a comp'd coffee.  Now, I understand that a Sunday is very busy, but when a restaurant makes this many mistakes in turning out food, it maybe time to start looking towards upgrading the kitchen staff or increasing the amount of people in the back of the house. It seems that this restaurant, while makes a good breakfast, fails to execute in their dishes. It's frustrating because they're so miniscule, but they're simply overlooked at this restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the chicken enchilada omelette...amazing! They bake tortilla chips with sauce and cheese on top! It's like having and enchilada with a side of chilaqiles! The potatoes were good, although a little heavy with with the seasoning salt. Tanya, our server, was friendly and helpful. She checked in with us regularly and made sure we were supplied with plenty of beverages and sides, like extra sour cream to extinguish the spicy enchilada sauce, lol. We may return tomorrow and then I'll try the loco moco!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars but im going to bump them up to a 5 cause of their banana nut muffin and how quickly we got our food  their \"benni's\" are DELICIOUSSSS.. i love eggs benedict and their take on it is so good.. plus their servings are ginormous so youre definitely getting what you pay for.. we also had one of their omelettes.. delicious.. there's not a negative thing i can say about this place.. im glad it's right next to my house but i'm really sad that i only get to go home once a month..   theyre not open late so go early.. my friends have been raging about this place and i finally got to try it out last weekend.. definitely added to the list of places i have to go whenever i stop by home"}
{"text":"Veronica  rocks. We get there when they open. She is all smiles. Excellent service. This is our go to place before work"}
{"text":"I went to this location for the first time today with my boyfriend and the service was amazing! Right as we were seated the server, Travis, came to make sure we were okay and gave us time to look over the menu. Once we decided what we were having, he got our order in right away and even checked on us before our food even got to us. Once we got our food, he checked on us a total of three times before we were ready to go. It was like he could sense if we needed something! The food was amazing and got to us in a timely matter! Definitely my favorite Egg Works in town!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for a big sloppy breakfast.  Though there are non-sloppy options here, I enjoy the messy belly-bombs better.  It's always busy, the portions are immense, and it's a great spot to tend to your hang over.  Plus, this location serves alcohol!"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here the food was delicious. The portions were huge. I ordered the veggie omelet with side of fruit also comes with banana walnut muffin. The ingredients in my omelet were very fresh and tasty. My husband ordered the great works omelet. My mother in law  had the turkey wrap. She was only able to eat half it was huge! The kids had scrambled eggs, potatoes and bacon. The kids didn't eat the potatoes too much seasoning.  I checked in with Yelp and got a free muffin to go! Lovely it was very good!  The kids enjoyed their free colors and fun menu."}
{"text":"Was feeling hungry after I got off work late last night / early this morning...  friend and I decided to try this place out.  It's right around the corner from his house but he'd never even heard of it.  We got there around 7:30am and there was a decent crowd there...  about a half hour later there was a line of people waiting.  Guess we had good timing!  I went with the chili skillet...  it was delicious...  It came with their potatoes on the bottom, with some slightly spicy chili, a good bit of melted cheese, and two eggs on top.  Definitely would recommend this one.  Perfect portion size and with a nice sweet slice of pineapple on the side of the plate.  My buddy went with the Denver Omelet...  Iooked great... nice and big (4 egg), well-filled.  He ate the whole thing so it must have been good!  He wasn't a big fan of the potatoes...  Their potatoes are the small rectangular/squarish ones....  kinda heavily seasoned.  He and I both prefer a more traditional hash brown.  Not sure if they're available though.  My skillet had the potatoes.... which were really good with chili and cheese on them... but as a side dish I wouldn't have been crazy about them.  Service was quick, friendly, and efficient.  They have to be to keep the crowd moving!  Would definitely go back... and would probably get the same thing.  Just don't try going much after 7:30am on a Sunday though, unless waiting in lines is your thing."}
{"text":"Excellent service, yummy food, awesome portions! Got a great deal on Groupon: $26 for $40.   We beat the rush before 10am on a Sunday and only waited for about 5 mins. Greeted promptly and food was fast. We ordered two orange juices but the server offered a carafe to get more for our $. The server also gave us a free muffin because everyone had but one. He also helped us out with the menu, answering any questions and giving us ideas. Also, the portions were huge. I only ate half my omelet."}
{"text":"Donna was a great service was amazing ! The food was good it was my first time here I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Their Chicken Fried Steak just moved to the top of my list as the best so far. We're new to Las Vegas so we searched on Yelp, of course, for a great breakfast place and found Egg Works! The place was busy busy, but, that didn't stop them from providing fast and excellent customer service. Food was excellent! We'll be back, often."}
{"text":"This place has been my go to breakfast place lately. Usually busier on the weekends but still fairly packed during the week. I love that this place usually offers a Groupon price! Saves me a lot of money which is why I don't mind spending on dishes I can technically cook myself.   Service is always A1, more than what I would expect from a crazy busy place. My usual order consists of a simple American breakfast (scrambled eggs, sausages, and their delicious seasoned potatoes). They also serve a juicy steak and eggs meal, good portion too!   When I feel like venturing out of my comfort zone I get the eggs Benedict with the Canadian ham and Portuguese sausages on the side. Hearty but beware of the hollandaise sauce of course. Shoots your cholesterol right up!"}
{"text":"i liked it despite the long wait. My wife and I decided to go to Egg Works because we already had breakfast at Egg & I and then it turned out to be the same menu....I wish we knew."}
{"text":"Yummy food and great service! Thankful for the AC in this July heat. Don't forget to check in and get your free muffin!"}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast. Fantastic service (Lisa was my server). No wait time on a Sunday morning. Banana muffin was moist, tasty, and delicious. Ample parking. Incredibly attractive servers."}
{"text":"Egg Works is not for the faint-at-heart. Fantastic menu,large servings and wonderfully prepared food. If you want a good breakfast for a great price, COME HERE! They also serve lunch, but we haven't tried it. I have no doubt it's good!"}
{"text":"Christian was awesome, everything was served HOT and perfect. We come here every week and is is always the same."}
{"text":"Just tied this place for the first time. The waitress Jodi was very efficient and great service. Omelets were really good. I had bacon and avocado. HUGE chucks of fresh avocado and lots of melted cheese. Potatoes were good! The banana nut muffin was very tasty.  Hubby had a chicken omelet with avocado, also looked really good.  Prices were reasonable, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with my Grandmother this morning for breakfast, this is my second time eating here but first time at this location. We walked in and immediately got seated, which is ALWAYS a plus! Our server was Laura and she was very attentive! I had a western omelette and my Grandmother had a Mashed Potato Omelette, we ordered and got our food in a timely manner! The atmosphere in here is so welcoming! We were very pleased with our visit here and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I hardly ever feel like I waste money when eating out, but this place is an exception. They were good but my experience today solidifies my belief that this is a glorified truck stop gone chain. Our food wa greasy, undercooked and the toast--something a five year old can do right--was burnt. I ate quietly and left because it wasn't worth the energy to complain.  Needless to say, I shan't return."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in Vegas for a girls weekend and were looking for a yummy local alternative to the breakfast joints you find on the strip. We stumbled across Egg Works and thought we'd give it a shot, and I'm SO glad we did!   Our server was Nancy and she was a rockstar. There's nothing I love more than a friendly server who keeps my drink refilled. Nancy was also awesome in that she flawlessly nailed all four of our orders. (We all had breakfast burritos modified differently.)   Speaking of the breakfast burrito... SO GOOD! I subtracted bacon from mine and added avocado, and it was the best burrito I've ever had. The works potatoes that came with it were great too. The salsa served with it was so good I probably could've eaten it by itself. I also had a side of hollandaise sauce that was awesome too.   I'm so happy we stumbled on this place and will definitely be back next time we're in town!!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy but one can get seated pretty fast. The food is always heat. HOWEVER the service was surprisingly bad. What I order is none of the server's business. If I want to order something big then take most of it home, that is MY business not hers to comment on"}
{"text":"We were able to get seated for 6 the second we walked in for mother's day. The drinks and the food came out very fast and their fruit and waffle was to die for! I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Such a great breakfast and brunch spot - we frequent this place and LOVE the bloody Mary's, the scrambles & omelets are amazing and it's always hard to choose which one to get because I love every one I've ever had. The wait might seem long but they always get us in faster than expected, like magic. Parking is a little tough so go before the rush."}
{"text":"It was our first time here Donna was our server she was great help helping us with the menu. Her services was great we never run out of coffee or drinks thanks Donna."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning around 9:30 and we were seated within 10 minutes despite the wait. Very large restaurant with lots of tables and booth combos, family friendly as well.   We were greeted right away by Robert who was great to us. He was super friendly and very attentive which made our first time here an enjoyable one.   We ordered two banana nut muffins (SAVE YOUR MUFFIN BECAUSE IF YOU EAT IT, YOU'LL BE TOO FULL FOR YOUR MAIN MEAL). The banana nut muffin was moist, but I would have preferred more nuts in mine. But it went very well with coffee. Btw, if you order coffee, they give you a whole container of it along with different flavored cream  (If requested). I saw some French vanilla, Irish cream and caramel.   We also got the strawberry cream cheese French toast, which I thought would be a stuffed French toast but it was more of strawberry cream cheese sandwiched between two pieces of bread with some strawberry jam/purée on top. It was too sweet for me so I didn't add any syrup. Nothing special, so I won't be ordering it again. Maybe if they changed the bread to a baguette it would be a lot better!  I was too full to try my sisters chili cheese omelette but the leftovers were really good! The omelette was just eggs and onions with chili in between and some cheese melted on top & sour cream. And they don't skimp out on the meat like most places. It came with their seasoned potatoes which were still nice and crispy after being refrigerated and your choice of toast or banana nut muffin. We got the white toast and they butter it for you.  After your meal you can pay in the front at the cashier near the entrance.   Really great service and food at reasonable prices so I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"For what it is, a breakfast-brunch spot, Egg Works is exceptional! The food is great and the service is even better. Our server, Brigette, brought out the wrong sandwich. They not only made it right, they actually gave us another sandwich to go! The banana nut muffins were as advertised - awesome! I had the fiesta scramble. It was excellent and my wife loved her waffle. The whole party was impressed all around. Score 1 for Yelp!"}
{"text":"Ill admit it, Im easy....on breakfast places.  In my opinion, producing good solid breakfasts isnt exactly rocket science so most places that specialize in it usually get a pretty good ranking from me.  Even with my modest expectations, my visit to Egg Works was a pleasant surprise. The menu was varied, the portions generous and the service crisp.    After just getting destroyed by some octogenarians at the 9am bingo session, I decided I need to assuage my wounds in some eggs and potatoes.  I had been meaning to try Egg Works so after inviting my mom to come with me (hey someones got to pay after the drubbing I took) we entered the surprisingly rustic and charming restaurant for a late breakfast,  My mom instantly loved the bucolic decorations and I loved the big plasma tv's playing the World Cup games.  Distractions aside, we both commented on the wonderfully large menu and were impressed to even see ethnic Hawaiian and Mexican options.     I opted for the Sunrise Special which was essentially a greek omelet with feta cheese, spinach, tomatoes and artichoke hearts.  Accompanying the omelet was breakfast potatoes and my choice of their famous banana nut muffins or toast.  Wanting to kick it a tad more old school (with the bingo I was certainly kicking it old, old, old school), I opted for the toast.  Mom had the eggs benedict which she found to be exactly what the doc ordered.  As for my omelet, it was perfectly fluffy with the right balance of filling.  The potatoes were seasoned and plentiful however, they looked to be frozen and not freshly made.  I love fresh homefries and this was a slight disappointment.  Otherwise, by the end of meal I was full and ready to wash the dauber stains off my hands.    Overall, Egg Works is a fun, neighborhood breakfast joint.  Its larger than meets the eye which Im sure helps move crowds on the weekends.  Service was consistent and friendly and the prices were very reasonable, especially given how much food each dish seems to contain.  Both our meals were in the 9 dollar range and there were few things that really exceeded that in price.  They also are open for lunch and have a selection of salads, sandwiches and burgers.    Diagnosis:  Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places!   One reason why I love this place is their waffles. It's light and fluffy and they make it so perfectly that it's crispy on the sides but it stays moist and soft in the middle. I usually order it with strawberries, banana or blueberries on top. For me, it's the best waffle in comparison to other breakfast places. I also like their skillets here best. You can never go wrong with any skillet you choose. They always serve it smoking hot just the way I like it. I've never had bad service here.  Overall, this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent all around. I had the ham and eggs with hash browns, and sour dough bread. Generous portions and all tasted great. Service was good. Even though the Egg Works was packed there was no rush to get you in and out quickly. Can easily recommend for your breakfast"}
{"text":"What egg shortage?  I think every single menu entree had a minimum of 4 eggs.  Come with an appetite because the breakfast portions are huge.  I usually come after skating at the ice rink around the corner and it always hits the spot.  Great value for great tasting quality food, esp with a groupon deal.  Roman took great care of us, checking in on us several times even though it was peak brunch time."}
{"text":"This restaurant does have delicious food, but what's up with people bringing their dogs to eat with them on the patio ?  I personally find this offensive.  After we began to eat, dogs started to come in with their owners and we found that shortly we were surrounded by  two large dogs behind us and a small dog across from us. The flies were horrible ( flies do Love dogs) We quickly finished our meal then went to complain to the manager . All she said was  \" well everyone seems to LIKE bringing their dogs \"  Really ? What kind of answer is that ?  We went on to give reasons why this is NOT acceptable .....dogs bring flies, someone might be allergic to dogs, a small child might get bit, two dogs might fight , etc.  AND, why do residents of our community THINK it's OK ?  Don't they ever consider anyone else but themselves.? It's sad really to think our society is becoming so self centered !"}
{"text":"Maria was a great server. Very attentive and polite. Food here is also very good. You get a free banana muffin with check-in. Everyone loved the muffin and the food! I would say the potatoes were the slightest bit too salty but it was still tasty. Hubby liked the corn beef hash and I enjoyed the island favorite with sausage and rice. The rice is plain with no flavor but adding soy sauce and butter to it made it wayyyy better. We would definitely come back if we're ever back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not impressed. We heard so much about the Egg Works and their local moco that we had to try it. Been there, done that. The egg was cooked just right and the beef patty was good but the gravy was a disappointment.  If we come back we'll have to try a sandwich or something else. The restaurant is an open concept layout that makes it loud with customers with little volume control and they have a weird fenced off rock garden in the middle of the restaurant. The waitress Samantha was nice and did a good job. I would have to think hard about coming back to try something else.  On a funny note; when we got our check at the bottom it said to write a 4 or 5 star review on trip adviser so the waitress could win a trip to Disneyland.  I can't say I care for their tactics but I hope she wins."}
{"text":"My go to spot for breakfast! Huge variety and now they have a brick oven menu!   Recommend:  Island favorite  Classic Stromboli Omlettes"}
{"text":"First time ever going to egg works. The wait was about 15 minutes on a Sunday right after church.  We were seated outside on the patio and the weather was absolutely perfect. The food was perfect and so was the service. Ordered the bacon maple French toast and a side of potatoes. Yummy yummy. And a free banana but muffin was very good as well."}
{"text":"Always a great experience here. Friendly servers and service. Good comes out fast. We usually try to get here by 9 or 930a otherwise there is a wait. Arrived at aboit 915a and only waited less than 10mins. Left at 10a and ensure enough there was a crowd of ppl outside waiting. Our server today was Nicole and she was wonderful.  I recommend that it you get any of the loco moco dishes (3 types to choose from), you should ask for the gravy or chili on the side. That way you can be sure that you like the taste  and you can control the amount."}
{"text":"Excellent friendly service from EVERYONE here. Food was very good and came out pretty quickly. Consistent  with the other location in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here at least once or twice a month. Always grey service and amazing food! I love that the portions are enough for two meals. The wait is never long even when it's busy. We will be back in a few weeks !"}
{"text":"The bananna nut muffins are amazing!  The food here is hard to beat, they have a great selection of breakfast and luch foods and so far I haven't had anything i didnt like.  The season potatoes are delicious and their fries are delectable.  If you get a chance the classic stromboli shouldn't be missed.  The price is great and the service is always top notch.  They have little indicators at each table to flag down help if you need anything."}
{"text":"Great food!  The eggs were done to perfection. Most places can't do an over medium egg. This was just like the way I make them at home. Our server Candice was the best. Very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in town. I love the service, I've been here many, many times and have never had a bad server. Price is excellent and Cincy chili! My family is from Cincinnati and it's awesome that I can get cincy chili in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend for brunch on Sat. 4/15 about 12 ish.  Not terribly busy so we got in straight away.  My friend had suggested this place - her and her husband used to go all the time and said it was quite good.  Unfortunately this place leaves much to be desired.  Both of our orders came wrong - My friend ordered the Traditional Benny - eggs were wrong and she never got the muffin she ordered to start breakfast - I ordered over easy eggs.....they arrived overly scrambled.  The sausage links were dry & overcooked and the blueberry compote I ordered with my waffle didn't arrive the first time and after ordering it a second time, it came out looking more like blueberry Elmer's glue.  The 'fresh' blueberries accompanying my waffle had a horrible bitter taste.  While our server was very nice and polite, she was scarce after our food was delivered so we didn't have any opportunity to remedy the poor state of our food.  I was able to swallow most of my scrambled egg and some sausage in order to take my medication as it needs to be taken with food.  The waffle was left untouched sans one bite.  We never saw our server again until she brought the check.  We paid $36 plus tip for 2 meals - when asked by the cashier how everything was, I politely told her about what was wrong with our breakfast.  All she offered was an apology and the 'forgotten muffin' free of charge.  I politely declined, paid our bill and left.  We will never go back to this place......EVER!"}
{"text":"Egg Works was decent but the service that Megan gave us was awesome, she always made sure our coffee was full and checked on us often.   We ordered the Island Favorite - which is why I would give this a 3 - not quite Hawaiian was missing some items to complete the meal.   Would come back for the banana muffin but nothing more..."}
{"text":"Man, this place is GOOD!  Like really really good!    We went there this morning after my sister and I ran a 5k. We met my parents there who said they didn't have to wait for a table at all, score!  They have cute menus that look like mini newspapers and a huge selection of breakfast items!  Each page more delicious-sounding than the last!  I opted for the veggie egg crepe (yes that's right CREPE) because guess what? This item isn't made like a desserty crepe, it's a crepe made from EGG which makes it healthy and filling. The crepe was filled with spinach, mushrooms, cheddar (i swapped it for the Swiss) and guacamole and it was delicious. They served it with a side of Italian dressing but I liked it better with ketchup, but that's just me. It also came with really good potatoes that were seasoned with paprika or seasoned salt which was great.   Oh and I forgot to mention two things. 1.  It also came with this yummy banana muffin (almost like an appetizer) and 2.  Each dish can be made as a half size order which is more than filling.   My dad had The Works which he said was \"fabulous\" and my mom had their Greek scramble but had them turn it into an omelette. My sister got their stuffed French toast which just looked fancy delish.   Also special shout out to the staff there who extremely attentive and friendly. I really can't find any flaws and will definitely go back there again!"}
{"text":"Great food,  even greater service !  LouAnn was outstanding!! I'm an eggworks junkie!!!"}
{"text":"Food is bomb dot com!!!! Okay okay everyone has said it, the potatoes are amazing, the muffins are amazing and so are the burritos!!! Service was good, Lacie was my server, friendly and attentive... upset that after years of hearing from this place that I haven't come sooner!   Not crazy about the Bloody Marys but I'll definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Okay buckle up here we go.  I'm a first timer and couldn't have been seated in a more perfect section.  My first impression was not corporate at all very friendly and roomy. I'm a pretty big guy and never felt stuffed (no pun intended) . My server was Danielle aka. Dani, a gorgeous young lady with a bubbly personality and very knowledgeable about the food. We talked for a second I explained it was my first time here and right away she offered me a free banana nut muffin. Now my mom makes the best banana nut bread and for the first time in my 45 years of living I must confess. .. mom they got you on this one sorry.  I still love you though. So with the help of Dani we decided to go with center cut pork cops and eggs scrambled with pepper jack cheese and potatoes on the side with coffee and an English muffin.  Food came very quickly for such a busy place,  over all the food was great, however I am somewhat of a foodie so here's my critique. For a center cut pork chop it was a little on the thin side and for my personal taste a slight bit over seasoned. If you like meat for breakfast like I do,  i think their steak and eggs would be a more flavorful choice.  The eggs were cooked perfect and tasted amazing, and a big surprise was the house coffee ahhhh-mazzzzz-ingly deeeeeeeeeeeeeelicous. Over all i gave them a 4 start rating only because they don't have 4 and 1/2 star rating.  The half off was solely the seasoning for my personal taste.  After eating and thoroughly enjoying my breakfast Dani offered me a muffin to go (sorry mom I had to take it.) Overall food 4 1/2 stars, overall look and cleanliness 5 star and as far as service goes Dani knocked this one out of the park a perfect 10.  Thanks Dani for a wonderful breakfast experience. I will definitely be back and will bring friends,  thank you Dani an egg works."}
{"text":"OMG, best breakfast in Las Vegas.  Huge servings for the price and super delicious.  Huge menu and fantastic service.  Quick in and out.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ashely was our server and she was amazeballs. She was attentive, friendly, and on top of her game. The food was delish, as usual. The restaurant was clean, patrons were happy, and staff was great.  When you walk in, make sure you ask for Ashely!!"}
{"text":"Amy was so great!  Good food Good service And she is so patient!! We wanna help her win the competition bec she so deserve that!  Xo"}
{"text":"Braved the DMV on a Saturday and came here to fuel up while we wait out the lines. Denis provided great service and we had a great breakfast.  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This was the first brunch spot my girlfriend and I tried since we moved from California. I have to say, pretty damn delicious! Each time we've gone I have gotten the steak and eggs. I can't stay away! Also, I love the fact that they serve mimosas in a mason jar. Very GROOVY GROOVY atmosphere."}
{"text":"I don't live in the area but whenever I'm in town, I always stop here for breakfast. Their waffle with whipped cream and bananas is insane!   They have the best servers there, too. Based on my visits, DONNA is the friendliest, funniest and most engaging of them all.   Great job Egg Works! Can't wait for my next trip. :-)"}
{"text":"Fabulously delicious!!! Large portions. Good home cooking!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Egg Works and I must say it lived up to its reputation! We were greeted and seated quickly. Our waitress, Donna was helpful, quick, and made our whole experience that much better. The food was great! The portions were more than generous and the prices were pretty good, too!  This place was pretty busy but it didn't negatively impact the service in the least.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that this was hands down the best breakfast I have had in very long time! I order the Corned Beef Hash with a side of hollandaise sauce (trust me, you should too) ...any place that make their corned beef in house just has to be tasted. All the flavor notes hit perfect, and the spicy Diablo potatoes were spot on. The service was fantastic and warming. I travel for work and sat alone at the counter, but the staff made my morning memorable with friendly chit chat and great service. My one and only complaint was that I asked for my eggs over easy and I got them over hard... The runny yolk would have been amazing on the hash and potatoes... But the flavor bomb that hit my mouth on the first bite made me forget about this quickly."}
{"text":"First time at Egg Works while visiting with friends.  EXCELLENT service and EXCELLENT experience thanks to our server Will be back!  TAMARA!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast at Eggworks for the first time and I have to say it was delicious and an overall great experience. The restaurant was clean and spacious with lots of tables. The servers were polite and very helpful since the menu was huge.  I had the chili relleno omelet, with seasoned potatoes and English Muffin, very good.  Rita had the Holi Moco, an awesome take on Loco Moco, also delicious.  As I mentioned the menu had many choices, which means we'll be back."}
{"text":"The wait service has been a little shaky lately but the food makes up for it.  I eat here every two weeks with my networking meeting team and I never go wrong with the Denver omelette!  Hash browns and english muffin on the side.  The biscuits n gravy rocks too."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Definetly returning. One of my new favorite places in vegas."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots here in Las Vegas. Their banana muffins are to die for!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Loved the home-style feel and the service was amazing! They were more than happy to make dietary changes for diet restrictions and the house scramble was sooo good!! Good WiFi service for catching up on some emails and loved the menu variety (although a bit overwhelming!). Will definitely return."}
{"text":"We were on the strip in Vegas for our hotel, and reviews of breakfast options nearby were looking bleak.  Found this place through a combo TripAdvisor/Yelp search and glad we made the drive.  They offer a diverse breakfast menu that provides more alternatives than your typical breakfast options.  I had a chili relleno omelette - a dish I don't know that I've seen elsewhere and enjoyed a lot.  Also at our table were a pork chop breakfast meal, and veggie omelette.  Everyone really liked their food.  Service was great.  Place has a nice mom and pop vibe.  Recommended."}
{"text":"I've been eating breakfast for close to 60 years, and I'll swear on a stack of bibles that this is the best and most consistent breakfast place I've ever been to. It's nothing fancy, but their food is practically perfect and waitstaff is very pleasant. I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Nothing at Egg works is a disappointment. I would say this is my third time eating here and I can't get enough! I opted for the smoked chipotle eggs benny and my boyfriend got the works skillet. I topped it off with the morning haze which is frangelico and coffee. Delicious! My entree was delicious everything came out hot and melty the pulled pork was divine. My boyfriend loved the skillet he was barely talking or breathing because he was inhaling his food. The service was fast and friendly we had multiple people check on us. Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Like the other locations, this place consistently delivers great food, variety, and exceptional service which keeps this place ridiculously busy.  Our server was super nice.  At first we got sat at a small 2 person table with no width but our server was sweet and generous pulling one of her other 2 tops to combine so we had room.  Some servers may have been hesistant or may not have even offered since they'd essentially be giving up more tip.  We defintely kept that in mind when paying.  As for food, we had the Prime Rib Steak Benedict which was a unique addition to their massive menu.  Rather than a standard bene, it was over their croissant which provided for an intense and rich experience.  I loved the pairing with the hollandaise sauce and spinach.    We rounded the meal out with a waffles combo which was perfectly crisped but soft which was topped with whipped cream and bananas.  We had enough food to take home to have a second breakfast the next day.  You can't really go wrong at Egg Works and the Egg family.  It's not Denny's/IHOP and it's not Bouchon, but they are really good at providing quick, tasty breakfasts."}
{"text":"Probably 4.5 stars, not the best breakfast spot I have ever had In this world but but hands down the best spot in vegas so it gets 5.  This place is also the same as the Egg & I and I have eaten at both spots and they are both excelent.   There menu is awesome with all the regular stuff plus with crepes, omelets, scrabbles, skillets, bennys, and hawaiian breakfasts.  They also have a cincy chili section that I like, I have never had cincy chili for real but I know what it's all about (over spaghetti) and this chili is real good.  You can also get toast or a banana nut muffin with your meal.      They do everything well and I have never been disappointed with anything but my favorites are the cincy chili omelet, enchilada omelet, and anything with their excellent country gravy all over it.  They have a chicken fries steak skillet that is potatoes topped with chopped up fried steak, topped with gravy, topped with eggs however u want, it is AWESOME.  They also won some awards for their cincy chili burger but I have never had it.     My good friend and fellow yelper used to think cracked egg was the best place in town and refused to eat here for some stupid reason.  Well we ate here and he was mad at himself for missing out on this place for all these years, don't make the same mistake."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast joints in town! Love the variety on the menu! And staff is super friendly and attentive!  Portions and Prices are on point! Awesome place for a brunch!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food. Patty melt burger was bland and greasy and the fries way over seasoned. Service was great tho. Dasha did a great job. Glad I had a Groupon to use."}
{"text":"Confession of a Banana Nut Muffin Lover:   It all started with a desire to find the Mister a good American breakfast joint.  Having grown up in Vietnam, I do really prefer a French first meal (Vietnam was colonized by France and thus most of us are self-admitted Francophiles) and have subjected my loved ones to French breakfasts and brunches galore!  My fiance, however, had a good ol' American upbringing in the Midwest and ate morning carbohydrates like pancakes.  Enter Egg Works: adorable down-to-earth breakfast restaurant, all themed around ...Eggs!  Even the decor is completed with classic paintings with egg-ish slants, all the faces are replaced by eggs (including the Mona Lisa).    There is a plethora of egg dishes for you to order, my favorite is the egg-crepe, a tasty blend of crepe batter and egg (perfect compromise of French American traditions).  But the various egg benedicts (called Bennys at Egg Works) are also done well, including one that comes with prime rib on top of a buttered croissant - truly a diet sabotage worth your time.   But like most food love affairs: you come across that one delight so casually and unintentionally, this was how it began for me and the banana nut muffin.  I was not really even a muffin enthusiast, until then.  Adjectives like moist, soft, warm, perfectly sweet cannot deliver the experience of this muffin.  All I can say is, just try it and you'll know love, too!"}
{"text":"Eggselent service!  The free muffin was amazingly delicious! Our food was delivered really fast too! We got eggsactly what we paid for and more!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and I tell you the meals are huge and tasty.  If you have a big appetite this is the place for you.  If you do not have a huge appetite, I recommend splitting the meal if you come with someone else, which will lower the price significantly.  The reason why I did not give egg works a 5 star was because of the price, which unfortunately is consistent with all the other good breakfast establishments. If you don't mind taking a break from usual toast, please please please try out the banana nut muffin.  It is amazing.  Overall I recommend egg works but if you can split it with someone.  Otherwise you're going to have a massive breakfast to start off your day."}
{"text":"Service was great! Water was awful-didn't think water could taste so bad. Ambience is cozy. And the breakfast was good. The banana nut muffins were to die for."}
{"text":"The egg omelet was good, nothing special or unique.   The pancakes are more on the chewy side type of recipe.  Service was fine, just nothing I would say that would make it a must go."}
{"text":"Terrible service at the bar. I sat for 5 minutes while 2 waitresses ignored me while carrying on a conversation.  I finally asked for coffee,  they said ok, moved behind the wall and continued their conversation.  Finally I left."}
{"text":"Back again. The wife was right about the tuna melt - top 5 lifetime for me. The seasoned onion rings were great. Candice was a great server."}
{"text":"Ask for Rosie! She is super sweet and takes really good care of us. She makes us feel so welcome that I can overlook the weak coffee. I get fruit or tomatoes instead of potatoes to cut down on evil carbs. I have only had breakfast and usually get the veggie omelet or breakfast burrito. Both are very tasty and big servings... We always have leftovers to take home to my Pops.  the restaurant is clean and there are tv screens throughout the dining room, so you can catch up on news while you enjoy your meal. The food is great.  The service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Came to this place because of the great reviews, and was not disappointed. The prices run a little higher than average, but the food is great, the servings are big, and the staff is extremely nice and attentive."}
{"text":"This place rocks! My party of five had a wonderful time dining at this restaurant. For a party of 5, we were seated pretty quickly on a Sunday morning. I like the idea of having menus in newspaper form: old-school, yet creative.  I had a chicken enchilada omelette with potatoes and it was absolutely delicious. The addition of salsa and tortilla strips in the omelette were a great addition and added some great texture. The potatoes were seasoned nicely and had a good flavor to them; not much of a \"kick,\" but enough flavor to make them something special.  This place is not too loud, but don't expect any silence; what can you expect from a place that is packed? A great place to have a meal for breakfast or brunch. Too bad this place closes before dinner!"}
{"text":"Food is served in GIGANTIC portions, staff was very attentive. Food is ok, dont think I'd eat here again though, its way off the strip."}
{"text":"Came back again.  Our server Donna was awesome, again great food, quick, and tasted great!  Somehow we got right in today without a wait but even if you do have to wait, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Easy to review now. This place can get so crazy, but now we sit at the bar counter. First time we got Tori who is awesome, but the last two times Kat has been the waitress and she's great, too. We've made it a Sunday Morning every week kinda gig and Kat even remembered us last week after just one visit. The food is great. No real complaints anymore now that we've found the good waitresses."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Went here on Easter with the family and it was wonderful! I had the chile relleno omelette and it was sooo good. I was scared it was going to be spicy but it wasn't just had a slight kick to it. My son had one of the skillets and my mom had half portion of an omelette. We really like that they offer the half portions on certain items on the menu. I also had a mimosa which was also wonderful! I like that they offer certain cocktails on their menu. Our server was Joshua and he was awesome such a sweetie and very attentive. Will definitely be back soon!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! It's my favorite breakfast joint in Vegas. Can't beat the omelets, and the banana nut muffins are the BEST. And, they have fountain sofas. The trifecta! And the service is ALWAYS fantastic. You'll be lucky to have Jennifer! :)  I'm a customer for life!"}
{"text":"Eggsceptual food and eggcellent service.   Reina was a very attentive server. Eggsceptual food and eggcellent service.   Reina was a very attentive server. Eggsceptual food and eggcellent service.   Reina was a very attentive server.   I hate the fact that I was forced to install the Yelp app in order to post a review."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place to eat! The people are so polite. Roslin is a great waitress, super friendly and talkative. Love it here!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Great atmosphere. Also our waiter tina deserves a raise because she's great at her job. Definitly will be coming back."}
{"text":"By far my favorite breakfast joint in Las Vegas. I get the same exact thing every time I manage to make my way over here: Half order of the Denver Omelet w/ Wheat Toast. Most people do not know that the half order is 2 eggs and the full order is 4 eggs but let me tell you... if you're constantly going home with leftovers, try the half order. It is still extremely filling and it's literally only $6.75 for the Denver half order. It comes with potatoes, toast and the omelet still!! Best bang for your buck at this place. Check it out. Pic to follow."}
{"text":"I like to go to local breakfast spots when visiting Vegas. They know what they're doing. Had a wonderful server, Adrienne, at Eggworks. Girl was on her game. Coffee and water hit the table fast. I love that. I had their breakfast burrito, which she recommended. Delish.  My little boy was fussy, and Adrienne was very patient and accommodating. I recommend Eggworks on Rainbow. Ask for Adrienne. I hope she sees this."}
{"text":"My husband and I just got back from Vegas and I felt compelled to Yelp The Egg Works on Flamingo.  We stumbled upon it  as we were driving around my in-laws' neighborhood. Our server was Adriane and she's the reason I wanted to write a good review.  She was very warm and chatted us up a bit about our stay.  She's one of those servers that make you feel like you're home and you just know she's going to give you good service even though the place was very busy.  Adriane suggested the Loco Moco and my husband told her to pick anything off the menu for him.  He loved her choice.  I needed a few little sides and Adriane remembered and brought them out with a smile.  We never had to ask for anything, she was on her game.  Now, we will always choose a local breakfast place over a Vegas buffet and this location of Egg Works will be on our return visit.  Nice staff, good breakfasts, and great service."}
{"text":"They aren't known for big portions, but I think their portions are big. At least for the skillets. I love ordering the country skillet with a cup of coffee. And if my husband and I aren't starving, the skillet is perfect for the both of us.  Been here so many times though that I can sincerely say you cannot go wrong with any of their dishes. From omelets, French toast, pan cakes, Hawaiian menu, other skillets, etc- all solid!"}
{"text":"Food was good! Even though I didn't get my toast. So I don't know why the waitress asked me what kind of toast to go with my California Crepes. I chose sourdough and it says on the menu that I do get either toast or a muffin. Um I didn't get my toast and another waitress told me it doesn't come with it.   On another visit, I had to add some salt/hot sauce to the crepes for flavor because it really lacked..Nicely cooked though."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. I had the county fried steak and it did  not disappoint. Gravy has a pitch of pepper taste that just makes it soo good. The potatoes are so freaking good I can't explain you to try yourself"}
{"text":"We tried them with the a coupon I got in the mail. Buy one get one. Good food. I loved their banana muffins. Fresh fresh. Waitress was really nice."}
{"text":"The  meal was so so. Order  the  blackened  prim rib Benny , they  bring  it  chopped ....who does  that  to prime  rib.  And they  give  me  a  steak  knife . ...lol"}
{"text":"we come here all the time, our go to spot!   Closest place to a nj diner in the area.  Service is good and their very quick.  also has out door seating.  Very cost effective pricing as well..."}
{"text":"Amanda was amazing. I would definitely be back due to her exceptional customer service. I had the country benny... YUM!!! Quick service, convenient location, delicious offerings, and fast seating.   Looking for service with a smile? Stop by and look for Amanda!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, service and value. Outdoor patio seating makes for good atmosphere. Recommend the tuna melt and of course all the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Egg works is a really good place to get breakfast. This location is near the airport, so very convenient if you are just arriving in Vegas and hungry. The portion sizes are HUGE. After eating here, we decided we didn't even need to eat lunch that day.  Each entree is around $9-$12 and could feed two people."}
{"text":"Alexa was awesome!! Attentive and helpful, great attitude and over all awesome sever! Going back just to see her! Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Brandy is a great server. We came two days in a row, and ordered some of Brandys selections- great idea!   We went around 2:30 and we didn't have a problem having a seat in the bar area (one day) and the main dining room (the second day).  Anything you have will be great!"}
{"text":"Food was good. They do the standard breakfast menu well with some tex-mex dishes thrown in.   I had the \"Island Favorite\" which was hawaiian inspired, but for the price point it left much to the imagination when the dish arrived. Two slices of Spam, two eggs, and a scoop of rice. Where's the rest?  I'd go back for the service though. My server Amanda P rocked it! Attentive, but doesn't hover over like some buzzard.   Gonna give this place another shot. Also trying anything NOT Hawaiian inspired. But I'm requesting to be sat in Amanda's section."}
{"text":"Always have a great experience, staff is always friendly and helpful. Food is always tasty and generous portion. Best time to go is after 10am, usually not a long wait. The banana walnut muffin is awesome!"}
{"text":"Always great food and great service. Donna did great job of taking care of us today. The Ensenada burrito is great, love the tomatillo salsa!"}
{"text":"I love this breakfast spot. At all hours I can come and get greeted by friendly staff, and it also has a nice group of customers.  I enjoy the two eggs ( sad and happy) stand the have to get the waiters attention if your needing something. The food quality is fresh and delicious .  Try the bannana muffins  The restaurant also offers a flavorful bannana loaf for sell at the counter fresh and baked to perfection"}
{"text":"Food was great i had  chicken faita omelet it was delicious.  My hubby had the chilli relenos at first but didn't like so they give him another dish the corn beef hash and he loved it.  Service was just great fast and friendly. Portions was huge."}
{"text":"Our favorite brunch spot.  Can't eat here without getting the potatoes.  Friendly service every time.  Hellena has been our server a few times.  She encouraged me to try something new.  I'm glad I did!"}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience.  The food is of poor quality.  The service is mediocre.  I got the\" chili rellano omlette\" I was expecting fresh California or poballano chili's.  It came with canned green chilis.  The potatoes are cheap fried frozen potatoes , not fresh. Save your money there's much better breakfast places in town. .."}
{"text":"Took the family here this morning for breakfast, and we had a pleasant experience. The place was acceptably clean, busy, and the service was friendly and fast. While that was all good and fine, the reason we went there was to eat something delicious, and that was not the case. The food wan either delicious nor horrible.. My bacon and avocado omelet was super salty and had a weird taste which reminded me of a dirty grill. The country potatoes were the size of petite green peas and were a pain to eat. The pancakes were small and didn't taste like anything. The island platter was entertaining, because other than a chunk of pineapple, there was nothing island about it. Steamed white rice....not islandy or delicious at all. The Benedict was well prepared, but again nothing popped out in terms of flavor.  We really wanted this place to be way better and add it to our list of top breakfast places, but that didn't happen. There are lots more places to grab breakfast locally, and we are going to pass on this and keep looking."}
{"text":"so good worth the wait the potato works is the ishhhhhh the banana nut muffin is so moist and bomb omg egg works is great hands down the best breakfast place I've been ! so yummy"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! They have the best potatoes!! My husband absolutely loves their French toast sandwich. And it is delicious. Place is always busy but gets you in in a timely matter. They also give you large portions."}
{"text":"Egg works has the best breakfast in town. I always go between the sunrise mountain or the mashed potato omelette and either is a wonderful choice. So accommodating if you wanna change it up. At this particular egg works the service has been hit or miss. One time I was here and had Robert and it was the worst service I've ever had. Today, though, my server was PHENOMENAL!! Her name was Chelsea and she was on point! She would bring us things before we even asked like a mind reader! Thanks Chelsea! Also there's a dog friendly patio which is great for me and my two pups!"}
{"text":"PK was an awesome server!!! Due to PK, me and my girlfriend will be coming back!!!!!!! It's always refreshing to have such good service!!!!"}
{"text":"Food = Good / Average...  Price = wa~y over priced for what they really r! C'mon now! we all know breakfast is the easiest n smallest meal of the day We know it didn't cost them much to cook breakfast ONLY! My bf n I paid about $50 for a breakfast (That's how much we usually spend on dinner)n it's not even any fancy place annoying kids were all over the place when I tried to enjoy my morning coffee ;("}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with a networking group. Curtis was our server and he was great. He took very good care of us and got all the orders correct. He made sure all our coffee carafs were full and everyone was happy. The food was great and the private room in the back served our needs very well."}
{"text":"They were quite busy when we arrived and it maintained the entire time we were here. I ordered French toast with a side of bacon. The boyfriend ordered eggs Benedict. Unfortunately most of the food was lukewarm at best, room temperature at worst.   The muffin was good tho.   Don't think we will be back since there are other places to try."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I took a trip here yesterday figuring we wanted a decent breakfast. I was there once before but I don't remember what I grabbed.   This time I got the cinnamon raisin french toast. I'm not sure what they do different but I wasn't a fan of the french toast. Maybe it was just that day. I REALLY couldn't drink the coffee, it's free refills on coffee so I thought I would at least enjoy a cup o' java that morning. It was so horrible we had to as for the manager, Rochelle, she took care of it. She came back with a fresh pot of coffee, we tried it the second time with International Delight Flavored Coffee Creamer.  I hope they decide to get a different blend of coffee. I won't ever get it again."}
{"text":"This was a very homey and comfy place for breakfast. I like to try different things so I opted for the mashed potatoes omelette. It was served with their signature home fries and a banana nut muffin. I was very pleased with my meal good portion they and definitely enough to take home. I would go back again again and again!"}
{"text":"Donna was a great server, happy and cheerful. No complaints!!  The atmosphere is more like a diner and not really our cup of tea. We both had the sundance omelette it was good, not exceptional. The fruit was old. The coffee average for the kind of breakfast place it is.   Would we come back? Most likely no. Why 3 stars? Donna is the reason for 3!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, we had the breakfast burrito and the mash potato omelet... Those breakfast potatoes are some of the best I've ever had... Would definitely return... We hit this place on the way to red Rock Canyon.. Great place to fuel up before a day of hiking."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! There were so many options on the menu that I wanted and they made it so hard to decide what to eat. I ended up ordering the Stuffed French toast. Can't wait to go back and try an omelette and one of the skillet breakfasts. The food tasted great and I loved the restaurant. Unfortunately I don't live in Vegas, but I visit often and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Recommendations? I can do that (actually, it's what our server recommended):  1) EGG-CEPTIONAL OMELETTES: I'd recommend the Mashed Potato Omelette (a bacon omelette stuffed with garlic mashed potatoes, then topped with melted cheddar and jack cheese, green onions and a dollop of sour cream. it was great. (order a side of salsa to make it more unique) 2) FRENCH TOAST: Three pieces of Texas toast or four pieces of Cinnamon Raisin toast dipped in homemade batter and grilled golden brown, then dusted with powdered sugar. It is served with Works apples,and warm syrup. 3) CORN BEEF HASH topped with two eggs any style and served with Works potatoes, and your choice of toast or banana nut muffin.  *The Work's potatoes were tasty and the banana nut muffin was a real treat!"}
{"text":"I took my family here for brunch and it didn't disappoint! The manger Ashly is so nice and accommodating. Our Waiter PK is one of the greatest waiters I've ever had. If you go to this place ask for him. The food is amazing and they give you plenty of it. They start you off with a warm banana nut muffin,that taste delicious. We're from out of town and the waiter PK told us some nice spots to go and we took his word for it and we had a great time. Once again the food is great and the staff is awesome. Thanks Ashly and PK for great customer service and food"}
{"text":"I must give egg works plenty of kudos and handclaps because today's dining experience was beyond what I was expecting, in a very good way! I would like to personally recognize Richard, I believe was his name for the world class customer service provided today! My mom and I decided to give this place a try since we always eat at the omelette house and it's close to where we live! Once we got there we were seated immediately and greeted by a very friendly hostess! Our waiter was very pleasant and even suggested some of the top items to try and that were often ordered due to popularity. I went with the country fried steak skillet with egg whites and my mom had the veggie omelette with egg whites as well.. Everything was cooked to perfection and the skillets are HUGE so beware if you order any of those! Come hungry that's for sure I didn't finish but half of my plate! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great egg dishes! Good service and clean restaurant. My favorites are the egg dishes but the salads are very good, too!"}
{"text":"Chelsea was very attentive and upbeat.  Great server ask for her and you won't be disappointed! !:) food also came out fast and hot!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here every Saturday morning. We've made it a mini tradition. The service is always good, no matter how busy they are. We try to order something different every time we go. Some of my favorites are the chicken fried steak skillet, sunrise mountain, the pork chop and mashed potato omelette. I recently got the bacon avocado omelette and they loaded it with avocado! It was a pleasant surprise because so many places really skimp out on how much avocado they give you. This is a good breakfast place with a lot of variety in their menu. 4 stars only because their pancakes aren't that great."}
{"text":"We come here on pretty much every Vegas trip we take...just never got around to doing a review.  This place is a def a local spot.  Huge portions, friendly prices, and great food.  We always get the breakfast burrito...one of the best ever. Also their potatoes and muffins are legendary.  If you have a car, then this place is worth going to.  It's only 10 min from the strip."}
{"text":"Such a great brunch spot!!! I have to say...Egg Works has become a must-stop every time I visit Vegas. There really isn't anything like this in LA...[i.e., huge portions, delicious, reasonably priced].  My bf & I usually order a skillet and the original breakfast burrito. Both are super delicious, all thanks to those lovely potatoes on the side. The skillet actually has the potatoes all on the bottom and then covers them with cheese, eggs, and other goodies depending on what you order. You definitely have to try one!!! The breakfast burrito is my bf's favorite. I'm not sure if I like it as much as him...but I'm always down for a breakfast burrito. I think it's the salsa that makes it really.   We tried ordering the Cabo burrito...that was a BUST.. it's a wet burrito...too wet if you ask me..and it just lacked depth of flavor in my opinion. Won't be ordering that again.   Otherwise, the service is good and the staff is friendly. I will be returning the next time I'm in town. You should too!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot!! Menu items are amazing! The banana nut muffins are to die for!!! Service is great! Cheri was wonderful!! I always stop in for something awesome when I come visit Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Donna our waitress was amazing and very good with our large group with kids. she had great recommendations"}
{"text":"restaurant was freezing cold asked 3 waitresses to put heat on as other  guest were complaining as well . Didn't care just kinda blew everyone off,food got cold real fast . If you decide, to dine there be sure you bring extra blankets, boots, hats and gloves. They will  provide the straws while your hands are being kept warm in your pockets"}
{"text":"where do i start with these retards. my office orders from these guys for breakfast all the time i would say they screw up the order 85% of the time. they always try and make it better by giving us free food or gift cards that often end up costing me more once you add in all the clauses they throw on there. i always end up having to go back to get the shit they messed up or forgot what should take 20 minutes ends up costing my an hour and a half. this place doesn't function, i always leave a tip i am always polite and i keep giving them second chances. not again. this place flat out sucks"}
{"text":"This was by far one of the BEST breakfast I've ever had. The wheat pancake was out of this world. Server DOLLY was amazing and very attentive. Will definitely coming back again soon.  Send her to Disneyland."}
{"text":"Good banana nut muffins, love the greek omelet and the bacon and avocado omelet and the potatoes are good here as well. Biggest area of opportunity here is the french toast and it is still good."}
{"text":"This is the best spot for a solid old fashioned breakfast with the friendliest staff. I eat here every week and look forward to it as my reward for surviving the week.x"}
{"text":"I agree with Gie-Gie's review below. Upon arrival, we were sat in the 2 person tables by the counter. Shortly after we were sat, two \"technicians\" started installing cable lines on the TV that was practically right above my head. Even with the ladder there, it seemed like everyone needed to walk down that aisle. They literally hovered over us our entire meal, with no apologies from management. I found the food mediocre at best. When we went to pay our bill at the register, a rude employee yelled to everyone to move the line in the other direction; it wasn't what she said, it's how she said it. The person at the register never asked how our time there was (ironically); if she had I planned to give her an earful. And lastly, I paid with a $50 bill; the woman at register held it up to the light to \"check it's authenticity\"; I haven't had anyone do that in years (what happened to using a bill detector pen?); very insulting. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Glad to have found this place so close to our hotel. Food was delicious and Mariia was great! We really enjoyed our visit :)"}
{"text":"Very nice staff. I got the traditional eggs Benedict. It was tasty. Not my favorite, but good. The Diablo hash browns are delicious. The waffles are nice and fluffy. They gave us a free app since it was my first time, which was a nice touch. Overall I would definitely go back and try other things"}
{"text":"Been coming to eggworks for years even before this location opened.  Service is normally great.  We were sat right behind the bench when people wait to be seated. There is a wide opening in the wall there between the bench and our table. One customer who was waiting kept coughing without covering her mouth, right into my bf face. So we asked to move. We told the hostess and just waited a minute to find an open table. They didn't make a big deal about it and were nice about it.....except for our server.   He wanted us to move to a table nearby but we waited on the hostess to tell us where to go since we didn't wanna mess up any seating arrangement with the other people waiting.  He seemed mad we moved and we even saw him talking to our new server Natalia about us and shaking his head.   Look, no one likes some random stranger coughing near their face right before they eat. Either get a glass partitioner or some kind of divider at the wall or don't seat people there so close to people waiting. As for the server he should of had some kind of understanding why we moved. Nothing personal."}
{"text":"Ok so I just googled eggs benidect,(to make sure I'm not crazy) Deff has holinday sauce. Sorta is what makes eggs benidect eggs benidect. When you take biskets and gravy put a poached egg on it that dose not make it eggs benidect nor should it be on the menu under eggs benidect. It was sorta my fault for asumeing eggs benidect came with holiday sauce, on the other hand it should be on the menu under biscuits and gravy. The fact that I was still charged for food I didn't touch made me mad, and they want to argue with me about what eggs benidect is. I just googled it, and what ever they gave me deff was not eggs benidect."}
{"text":"I'm from Hawaii so whenever I come to the mainland, I make sure I get my fill of biscuits and gravy and oh my, Egg Works has THE biscuits and gravy.  The gravy is so flavorful and it goes perfect with the fluffy biscuits! I practically closed my eyes while biting into this. It was a very generous portion, I couldn't even finish it. I ordered it with the potatoes but the seasoning didn't really go well with the biscuits and gravy so I gave the rest to my boyfriend but the eggs and link sausages were perfect.  I also love that they gave a pot of coffee so that I could refill myself.  Customer service was great, our waitress kept checking up on us and making sure we were doing okay. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place gets you in quick and has great service and good food. I really like the skillet breakfast, just tell them light cheese, otherwise it's a mountain!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and oh boy! I enjoyed everything!!   I order the chile relleno omelette and it was delicious. Our server Edan was very attentive and friendly.  I will definitely come back to this location!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were seated and first impressions were already bad as the coffee cup in front of me had lipstick on it. It wasn't as if it were stained but more like it was rinsed or not even washed. Order was taken, then a check was given to me the same time the food was brought out. Had to look and ask around just to get a to go container. Issue checking out for the free banana muffin per Yelp check in as well. The muffin was good and the breakfast burrito was pretty decent. I'm unsure I would return after the service and the lack of cleanliness."}
{"text":"After arriving here based on several Yelp reviews I thought I'd give this place a try w/my family. The waitress seemed pleasant @ first but preoccupied & obviously didn't get my order correct, the 1st, nor the 2nd time. Upon receiving the sandwich, it was quite bland in taste & full of lettuce & tomato more so than I'd expected, lowering the quality of the sandwich.   My husbands breakfast tasted much better than mine & he was more than satisfied, along with one of my daughters. Which are in the photos on my profile.  However, only after we left did my other daughter reveal to me that in her Fruit Parfait that she ordered, she bit into something \"crunchy\" and when she pulled it out of her mouth (I recall her quietly getting up from the table & excusing herself, not saying a word & the rest of the day not eating anything) she said she saw an eye & part of a little head.. She was so disgusted & threw up in the restroom & was so mortified she didn't know what to say or do..? She didn't reveal this to me until later after we'd left so there was nothing I could do except write a review about it. I have \"no\" idea what it was or what it could've been.. But I do want others to know.."}
{"text":"I stumbled across Egg Works on a Saturday morning while driving around on a \"find a place to live\" mission.  It was really busy.  Since I was alone, the hostess suggested one of the open spots at the counter.  I took a seat between a friendly couple and the unfriendly reincarnation of Jimmy Durante.  The menu was overwhelming - which was a good thing since I was pretty hungry.  My server was quite nice, and didn't seem at all rushed in spite of how busy it was (in fact, all the employees seemed to be in a really good mood despite the crowds).  I ordered a coffee and the loco moco.  Both were very good.  I've had loco moco in Hawaii many many times, and this version was every bit as good.  The rice and patty were cooked perfectly, and the gravy was flavorful without being overpowering (they also provided extra on the side).  I consider myself something of a breakfast/diner snob, and I really liked Egg Works.  I won't be a full-time Vegas resident for a few more weeks, but I look forward to making this place a regular breakfast hangout once I get there."}
{"text":"Seriously, everything on the menu is perfect! The service has ALWAYS been incredible, AND they have a military discount? It's like heaven at this place! Highly recommend trying this restaurant if you haven't and take advantage of the check in offer! The muffins are amazing! You will love it!"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing breakfast with our baseball team! Our server Donna was extremely attentive & helpful. We will definitely be back! Thanks to Donna!!"}
{"text":"Blade is super nice and she always shows great customer service. The food is great. Their muffins are soooo good."}
{"text":"Went for an early morning breakfast with my friend from SD.  The place was nearly empty since it was during the week  Our Waitress \"Victoria\" was fun and took really good care of us.  Once she found out it was out first visit she promptly brought us a complimentary banana nut muffin.  I have never met anyone from Nebraska who says \"groovy\".   She took great care of us and the overall service was as Victoria would say \"GROOVY\"!      I had the crazy chicken omelet which was cooked to perfection.  Being a large omelet I thought that was quite impressive.  Lots of chicken and other goodies inside made it a welcome morning treat.  It came with potatoes which were also very good but I decided to focus my attention on the omelet and conquer it.  I took home corned beef breakfast and potato omelet for my girls which were thoroughly enjoyed when they woke up.  The banana nut muffins were awesome.  Great place for breakfast whether you live here in Vegas or are visiting and making the trek back home."}
{"text":"my best friend and I tried this place after hearing so much about it. wound up being a typical American style breakfast house with decent food. he ordered a chicken and spinach skillet that was ok at best. there really wasn't too much spinach in the skillet however and the cheese overflowed the top which wasn't pleasant. I had a Denver omelet that I wanted mushrooms in, but wound up coming without...   overall, I give this place three stars because, despite our not-so-good server, the manager was extremely hospitable and friendly. being in the industry, my best friend and I don't really ask for much when it comes to dining out because of our own personal experiences with difficult guests, but the server totally forgot our add-ons to the food, lacked attention to see if anything was ok, and pretty much came to drop the check and asked if everything was good when the meal was done. the least he could have done, was apologize for forgetting things, but due to his lack of attention the experience was kind of droll. food was ok. but, I doubt we will be recommending this place overall. the manager's name is jasmine I believe. great job miss! you are super sweet and because of you alone, we might give this place another chance in the far future."}
{"text":"I had previously been to a different las vegas location but I just moved to this area of town and decided to give this location a try. As always the food super impressed me and when I ordered a dish requiring a long wait time our server Bruce brought out free muffins to alleviate some of our hunger. Definitely glad I moved close to this location and will be back often!"}
{"text":"Food is always delicious. Service usually good, but sitting at the bar is definitely hit or miss with a good server. The potatoes are the BEST!! Bloody marys are kinda thick- I like mine less tomato-y."}
{"text":"Veronica was our server and even though the place was packed (as it always is cuz who doesn't love Egg Works) she was extremely attentive and friendly. Servers that always have a genuine smile on their face are hard to find, and Egg Works seems to have found the best of them. If you get Veronica's section know you will be in very good hands!  Delicious breakfast as always."}
{"text":"I'm not an egg fan but my husband could live on eggs.  We wanted to try something new and decided to give the Egg Works a try.  They were relatively busy for a Sunday morning but we were seated rather quickly and our server acknowledges us within 3 minutes.  I ordered a skillet breakfast, delish! their Works potatoes are cooked to perfection with a hint of garlic on them. My husband got an omelet with three kinds of meat in it. (yes, he got yelled at for such a poor choice). If you don't like cheese, don't order anything with cheese on it.  Both our dishes had tons of melted cheese piled on, which was awesome.    Service was just ok. The server never asked how our meal was  after it was brought to the table and since the coffee was bitter i wanted water. Finally had to flag her down halfway through my food to get a glass of water.  I also waited and waited to get a box for my muffin.  I'm amazed at the lack of face time restaurant managers give. I saw a manager once during our 45 minutes to an hour there when a table's order was wrong outside of that, i never saw a manager again.   I would return again but maybe not on a Sunday morning when they're so busy.  I'll give our server the benefit of the doubt and say that's why the service wasn't stellar."}
{"text":"Food was just okay for me what makes this place 5 star is Raul!!! He handle our party of 20 with no problems! I dont think we hardly ever had to use our sad face flipper for service. He came by everytime making sure we were taken care of. He made sure our kids were taken care of even pouring water for them, even with a water pitcher on the table. The banana muffin was complimentary thanks to yelp and it tasted so good with the table butter. The wait for the table was long, but Raul made it worthwhile. I ordered huevos rancheros and it was just ok in my opinion. My cousins loved there food, not sure what they ordered. Overall everyone was hungry and the food was large portion, so there was a lot of take out boxes. We literally all had leftover brunch for dinner. I would only come back to this place because of Raul! I wish every waiter we come across was just like him. Also, its doggie friendly also for outdoor patio. I would not suggest sitting on the patio in the summertime. Like its vegas! It gets 100 degrees!"}
{"text":"Like many somewhat trendy breakfast spots in town, the prices are a tad on the higher end but you do get huge portions and the food itself is really great! We come here about once a month for a morning \"work\" meeting. I typically get the sunrise sandwich and it's delicious. The pancakes here are greeeeaat as well. If you are on a super tight budget then I would suggest looking elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Very possibly the worst meal I've had in my life! The service was fine but the food was inedible. THe \"fluffy scrambled eggs on a fres croissant\" was actuall a croisant in the bottom of a stoneware skillet smothered in egg, cheese and sausage. Greasiest thing I've ever had put in front of me.  Other items looked just as bad. The lady sitting nest to me had the taco salad and the smell of the canned salsa made me nauseous.  The \"good ole tymie\" decor added inslult to injury. Never again."}
{"text":"We got a Groupon for this restaurant. We went in it took about 5 minutes to get our table sat down ordered some breakfast and enjoyed our breakfast it was piping hot the whole entire time. Very good omelettes feeling delicious we will come back"}
{"text":"What we had: sunrise mountain. Croissant topped with eggs and bacon and cheese. Yummy and artery clogging. The potatoes were spicy and flavorful.  Stuffed French toast: delicious, sweet chewy Coffee: weak and bland. They had hazelnut and regular. Both suffered from weakness  Service was quick and attentive. Jordan was nice and kind of cute if you care about such things  Atmosphere is generic breakfast place. Lots of TVs to check out news  Would be 4 stars if not for the coffee.   $28 including tip"}
{"text":"First time here.  Used a groupon to try it out.    Diner fare done right.  I ordered banana pancakes with sausage patties and scrambled eggs with cheese.  Pancakes were good, bananas ripe and not mushy.  Our waitress Maria was sweet and attentive.  I will defintely come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I chose this place for breakfast in Vegas based on the Yelp reviews. We were not impressed!  My wife ordered the mashed potato omelet and I ordered the vegetarian omelet - good but nothing special. The coffee was bland. A cut above Denny's..  The best thing about the whole experience was our server - Theresa - very attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"Stopped by today to grab a bite with the husband.. and I have to say Nicole gave us some awesome service. We will always ask for her when we come back. You guys have some amazing food especially the waffles! And they serve alcohol! The mimosas are awesome. Thanks Nicole!"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for awhile and finally decided to try it. It's very yummy! Service is fast and good. I had the cream cheese stuffed french toast and my husband had the chicken fried steak with the breakfast potatoes. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Cute little place to get breakfast or lunch.   They serve all food on the menu all times of the day.  I'm not particularly a breakfast person, they said it was \"no problem\" to get a BlT for breakfast. The food wasn't greasy. It was just right! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We decided to have breakfast here on a Tuesday morning. My fiance has always raved about this place having the best banana nut bread - he was not wrong! The banana nut bread has the appearance of a brown bran muffin, but it tastes quite the opposite. I'm not a fan of banana bread, but this was one of the best banana nut breads I've ever had! Also, when you check-in here on Yelp, you receive one free banana nut bread!  I ordered the homemade corn beef hash with scrambled eggs and my fiance ordered the three pigs omelette with extra avocado. He loved his omelette and they were extremely generous with the avocado portions.   Unfortunately, my corn beef hash did not taste like I was expecting. I only had a couple of bites by the time our check was brought to us. I informed our server, Olivia, that it didn't taste quite right to me and she was very kind and apologetic. She asked if I wanted to order anything else and after I politely declined, she brought us our check with the corn beef hash taken off from our bill. Olivia went above and beyond to make our dining experience great and we will definitely be coming back so I can try another item off their menu."}
{"text":"Great that I can work in low carb subs without a bunch of extra charges.  Always good fresh food.  Really good Cincy Chili even though I am not allowed to eat it any longer."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today.  They were not even remotely busy yet it took over half an hour, almost 40 minutes actually, for the four of us to get two salads, a chicken salad sandwich and my Denver Omlette was delivered last!!!  Almost 10 minutes after my friends were delivered their food.  Not a good experience AT ALL.  I will not be going back and I certainly won't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Eat the island special with Spam. Can't go wrong with that. Service was excellent. Half of our party was late but they didn't seem to mind. I like that. I tried the corned beef hash, and that was pretty bomb, too. Banana muffins were a great appetizer to start with. I would definitely come back here because of the great service and because of the food."}
{"text":"They are always consistent.  Great food, friendly people. A nice local gem. The wait on the weekends can be brutal but they make up for it with the great food."}
{"text":"Loved the food here!  Great portions and our server Chelsea was attentive and answered all of our questions.  I had the Denver omelet with egg whites and it was delicious. My wife had the bacon and avocado omelet with egg whites and it was also awesome.  They also serve mimosas and Bloody Marys if you so desire. If you're looking for a great place for breakfast or brunch, look no further!"}
{"text":"Everything is so good. All the Benedict's, omelette's, skillet's are delicious. Huge fan of their seasoned potatoes. But the star is definitely the banana nut muffin. Can't say enough good things about it. Love the banana but muffin!!! Whatever you get, you can't go wrong. Everything is tasty."}
{"text":"First if all, we really love their food. We've given them so many chances. We were going there once a week at one point. I order the same thing every time, but my order always came out wrong, something different every time. The service was slow and sometimes unfriendly. We're unfortunately writing this place off after our very last try to give this place a chance. We always have a bill of over $60 and tip 20% even when we don't get good service in hopes we might get better service next time. Luckily there's plenty of other breakfast spots that we are discovering, we love their food AND their service."}
{"text":"Service is good, and let me tell you, the first time we were there and older couple passing us out the door said.. try the Traditional Benny (Eggs Benedict), and they were so right.  I have not been able to order anything different, because I like it so much.  I have tasted other family members food, and all have been great.  It is especially a good deal with the Groupon Deal"}
{"text":"Always tasty and fresh, consistent food quality and service! Our favorite on this side of LV."}
{"text":"Way way too busy, way too many unruly loud kids, very hectic and frantic wait staff. waiters way too flamboyant and over the top, and all over the place and acting very busy and rushing for no reason. long wait lines just to pay your bill.hostess was very clueless or new....and didnt know anything. Asked hostess was there a long wait for a table she replied well sir not really sure, asked her if they had any plastic bags, she said Ill ask a manager. Asked hostess if she could get my check she  said wait a minute I might havento go look for your   waiter.   Either your waitstaff has too many tables or bad mgmt. It was just a zoo @! 1:-pm on a Tues..oh all luke warm cold food. Hate cold food, and a real bad grade..everyones food comes out one at a time...... staggered"}
{"text":"This is my favorite chain of breakfast restaurants in the city.  Fair pricing, friendly staff, super yummy fare w/side options generally given of fruit or seasoned fries.  You may also ask for their delicious banana bread, served warm..add butter and dive in.  My personal favorite is the Spinach Benny followed by the Fender Bender (Sahara location). Each location, however has a slightly varied menu. I love a glass of grapefruit juice on the side as well. ($3.25.)  Open 'till 3pm."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Adrienne was our server. She was nice. Portions seemed to have gotten smaller for breakfast, but not too much. Turkey bacon was a bit small and extra was a bit overpriced. Other than that, we enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in Vegas! They have by far the best Eggs Benedict ever and the best potatoes I have ever had. The eggs Benedict are smothered in hollandaise sauce which is full of flavor and exactly how hollandaise sauce should taste. The potatoes are seasoned to perfection and you can't stop eating them.This place is legit! I highly recommend it. The staff is very friendly and fast. The decor is also great and fun. If you are around and have time to stop by, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place ever! No questions asked.   Whoever thought of the concept of this place, from the decor to the food to everything else in the restaurant, is a bonafide genius! So thank you very very much.   Decor: This is an extremely family oriented restaurant. With a large dining hall with silly pictures that features eggs (example: egg-faced Mona Lisa), it's really inviting to people of all ages. The menu looks like a newspaper with cute little cartoons all over.   Service: I don't know if all the servers are required to have their morning coffee, but all of them are so perky! There's an black egg you can flip over to a yellow egg - this indicates that your table needs something. When this happens, any one of the Egg Works staff will come over and will ask what you need. What a great idea! This prevents from you staring awkwardly all over the restaurant for your server. Your server will bring your check over to your table but won't be your cashier. So after you're done with your meal, you have to go up to the front to pay. I don't mind this unless there's a huge line in the front at peak times. Then I get a little annoyed, but I guess I have to deal with it.  Food: YUM. Most of their dishes come with their \"Works\" potatoes. Perfectly cubed and perfectly seasoned! I can seriously have a plateful of just their potatoes. You can opt out of that for some fruit or cottage cheese. I've tried many of their dishes and was never disappointed. My favorites are listed below:   - Works Veggie Benny: Calling all vegetarians! An English muffin topped with fresh spinach, tomatoes, huge chunks of avocado, two poached eggs and drizzled in hollandaise sauce. This is my favorite item on their menu hands down.  - Vegetarian Crepe: Calling all vegetarians, again! A hefty serving of guac, mushrooms, spinach and Swiss cheese. The Works poppy seed dressing is tangy and sweet, the ultimate dipping sauce to this dish. ** I am NOT a vegetarian by no means, but the two above are DELICIOUS! **  - Greek Scramble: Chicken, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, spinach and feta cheese. OPA! in my mouth. For real.  -Blackened Prime Rib Benny: This is my boyfriend's favorite dish there. And I quote, \"What cow danced and left a mess in my mouth?!\". Prime rib lovers, this is for you.   Pro tip: Portions are huge here. For a lower price, you can get half portions for most of the items on the menu. So for those on a diet, you can still enjoy the succulent flavors of Egg Works!"}
{"text":"Excellent service with delicious food. The portion is huge here. They also do half order. I got the blackened prime rib Benny and bf got the skillet. Check in on Yelp and get a free banana muffin.  they have a huge menu. Def coming back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"This location has pretty good customer service and the food comes out in a hurry. I really enjoyed the breakfast burrito with the Veracruz sauce. It was super filling and I slipped into a food coma shorty after eating this beast of a burrito. If you have a hankering for Egg Works this is the location to go to if your in the southern portion of the Vegas Valley area. Don't forget to do your check in to get a free banana nut muffin."}
{"text":"This place has redeemed itself. I have been going with the Santa Cruz skillet lately and it has been consistently good. The green sauce pairs perfectly with the eggs and home fries mixed with chorizo. So yummy and filling for sure! Also don't forget to check in to get yourself a free muffin!!!"}
{"text":"Zero stars.  We sat for 15 minutes waiting for a server to come take our order, finally I  just got up and went looking for one. When I found one she wasn't apologetic at all about forgetting about our table and wasn't very friendly!! Then when the food finally did come, my food was undercooked!!  This is my 3rd time at this place every single time has been disgusting, either the food has come over cooked or Raw like this time but since this location is only 1/2 a mile from my house I want to like it and I want to support them and I keep telling myself to give them another try just in case they just had one bad day. But every time I come  I'm extremely disappoint. I honestly would have had better service and better quality food from McDonald's. I am disappointed I went against my best judgment and decided to give them one last chance. Never again!"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding! Thank you Ash H. For helping us enjoy an awesome breakfast too. The omelet was great, and served to order.  The potatoes were tasty, but had a lot of seasoning which may have had MSG, so I steered away from them. If you are looking for a sugary waffle indulgence they are loaded with whipped cream and berries which I am sure someone enjoyed thoroughly."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Truly a MUST when you're in Vegas - its such a refresher to kick back, relax than being on the strip with gigantic buffets, long lines, people bumping into you as you're trying to walk back to your table with a plate of food, meh!   I'm sooooo glad I read Yelp reviews before to find out you can half order your omelette (its normally 4 eggs yikes!) which is perfect for someone trying to watch food portion.    Thank you - I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Candice, our server today was excellent. For the very first time we had to send something back & she went out of her way to make sure we still had a wonderful dining experience despite a minor issue that really was no big deal, our new order came out perfect. Wonderful breakfast spot. We highly recommend the stuffed french toast."}
{"text":"This place is the best for breakfast, fresh food, great service . Jasmine was my server and she's the best! She took care of me, I didn't have to wait for refills on coffee, very attentive .Egg Works is becoming famous in Las Vegas because of people like Jasmine as well as the great food and service"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place hands down. No matter which location you go to the food is always top notch and you can count on fast and friendly service. Veronica was our server today and she was an absolute doll. Another stellar meal.  Some of my favorites include the eggs and cheese stuffed French toast, the chile relleno omelet, pork carnitas, and classic breakfast. The red chile sauce they serve with some of their Mexican breakfasts is so good we usually request some on the side in lieu of salsa."}
{"text":"A must every time we visit Las Vegas!   You know this place sells alot of egg dishes when the delivery truck delivers eggs by the stacked case - and many of them.  You can get your egg dishes just about any way you like them and know that you'll have a good experience. I tend to favorite the California Omelet which has tomato, fresh avocado and mushrooms, along with melted Swiss and hollandaise sauce. The omelet alone is more than enough at 3 eggs, but they include some great potatoes (or another side) and a banana nut muffin which is usually good, but this time tasted a tad off. I didn't mind the muffin, but my kids didn't enjoy them as much this time.  Their service style is interesting - flip your metallic \"egg\" at the table if you're unhappy to get someone's attention. Neat concept!  Warning - portions are LARGE. If you're traveling, you'll likely feel like you're wasting food unless you choose to share (they may charge for that, but it's not excessive). After the muffins, I could only eat \"most of the omelet and a small bit of potatoes before feeling stuffed."}
{"text":"Great customer service, this was my second time visiting and  I was treated well, and our food was right on time, for a large group like ours 15 of us,I was surprise at the swift serve along with still providing quality food. Great place for eggs"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE. We have been eating here regularly for about 4 years. The food is very good, as is the service. Two of my favorite items on the menu are the Corned Beef Hash and the Chili Relleno Omelet. They both stand out, have a delicious unique flavor. We had a few minor problems on our last few visits and decided to, as politely as we could, mention them to the manager. We spoke to two managers who were both excellent listeners and genuinely interested in our input. They both offered, pretty much demanded, to pay our bill and gave us a loaf of their delicious banana bread to go. It was a very pleasant conversation and was refreshing to hear both managers genuinely concerned about us having a great experience there and we will continue to make Egg Works one of our favorite \"go to\" breakfast spots."}
{"text":"This is my go to weekend brunch spot. The servers are really friendly and if you just order ahead and get it to go, there's almost no wait. Our food is always just as warm and perfect doing it this way."}
{"text":"Always great food and great service from Ashley H. The Works skillet was great and a friend got the mashed potato omelette and said it was great."}
{"text":"My family and I had a great time at this place. My boys always order the island favorite. I ordered the bacon with avocado omelet. I would say price is reasonable. Food is amazing!!   Today, was a bit busier than other days, but the wait went pretty fast. Our server was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Love it here! Great service, timely, attentive and spent a lot of time helping us with menu substitutions when we wanted a different type of order. Always leave happy and full!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  (apologies for taking a few weeks to finally write a review)  Great menu, with a lot of options.  Recently, we started to get much more health conscious and more specific about our food options, so my wife asks a lot more questions about each item and what all is in it.  Every person has provided excellent service and patiently answered each question!  Thank you for that.  We greatly appreciate it.   On top of that of course is the quality of food.  Every meal has been outstanding.  We just found you two months ago, but we have been back repeatedly and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to an Egg Works and Mario helped make it a very pleasant experience. His service was quick and good to make sure we were taken care of! Thank you, Mario! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Egg Works and Egg & I are solid breakfast spots! I'm always seated pretty quickly and checked on frequently. They have a table signals at every table that let staff know if you need anything and they are quick to serve when you do. Prices are reasonable and they seasoned potatoes are delicious. I had the huevos rancheros and there was a little too much cheese for my taste but it was still really good. Recommend this place for lunch too. I have had a buffalo wrap that was good as well."}
{"text":"Convenient and attractive decor.  Good service.    OJ isn't fresh squeezed.  What kind of self-respecting bfast joint serves OJ out of a bottle?  Corn beef hash was salty, stringy, and runny.  I was disappointed."}
{"text":"It has been 2 years since I have eaten @ Egg Works, so I ordered the same thing:  Chili Skillet.  Of course the skillet came out with piping hot chili, crispy breakfast potatoes, and my usual medium fried eggs.  Also, the delicious banana nut muffin is a must side!    If you are tired of eating buffets on the Vegas strip, definitely eat brunch at Egg Works....I heard there are more locations around Vegas now!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of this place. I have been here a couple of times because it is big, cheap, and the service is fast. The food is okay, not the best. It isn't my first choice of breakfast joints, and I usually go here out of convenience.   Ambiance - Family oriented restaurant. If you have kids, it will be a fun place to go. They are really nice and friendly. Since it is a chain, I wouldn't really expect anything else.  Food - The food was decent. I just dinner think it was anything special. It reminded me of a Denny's or IHOP. I ordered the breakfast burrito - it was good. I lived in San Diego for 6 years before vegas, so I can be a little picky. The thing that for me the most were the potatoes. They definitely came out of a freezer box. I think they used the same ones my old catering company did.  I probably will end up going back here because my friends like it, but it will take some convincing."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place in our last day in Vegas. I ordered my favorite breakfast and didn't know what to expect. Not everyone knows how to make good eggs Benedict. They definitely got it right. Delicious, delicious and delicious. Eggs cooked perfectly. And on top of that the service was perfect. Candice was nice and fun. She has a good vibe and positive energy.  Overall a good experience. Thank you"}
{"text":"I really liked dog friendly patio and the service was excellent!! Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable of all the food. We tried three different entrees and the food was so so. But their banana muffin was really excellent and I will come back again!!"}
{"text":"I just love this place!! the food is great and the service is amazing. ever since the first time i went in there i have never had a bad experience!! the last time i went in there i was a little confused on what i wanted to order and the server helped me choose the best meal and  i was happy with it!! this place is near my job so when ever i have time i just take a break to have breakfast there!! I recommend this place to all breakfast lovers!!"}
{"text":"I come here every time I come back to Vegas. Great food, amazing service and awesome atmosphere. Every time I order something different and I'm never disappointed. Yum."}
{"text":"Huge portions , good price but no real flavors. Either to spicy or to bland and they throw a cheap maple syrup on the side.  No healthy breakfast options , no vegetarians or vegans options neither.  We will not return"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. Enjoyed Pumpkin Pancakes, Mexican Omelette & Bandito scramble. All 3 of us liked everything. Donna is best server. She's professional, Friendly attentive in just the right way & amount. Totally recommend"}
{"text":"Come here often with friends and family. Food always excellent as is the outstanding service. Today I had biscuits and gravy, with eggs and link sausage, and two banana nut muffins. (Yes, two--they are THAT good!). Delish, as usual. Our weekend go to spot and it should be yours too! Get here early on weekends--its really busy!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there the other day for a late lunch. There were, literally, only a few people eating there, mostly an older set finding respite in the cool air. The service was very good, but not very prompt, particularly considering how slow it was. The wait people were exceptionally nice, though when we asked about certain dishes, *everything* was \"great!\". I think the pace was indicative of the laid-back clientele.  We got a chicken wrap, fries, chili and drinks. The wrap was good - though certainly not $11 good, the fries were better than average (and raved about by the waitperson), and the chili was, simply, forgettable. In total, yes: meh.  Will go there in a pinch, but it will never be a first-choice destination."}
{"text":"Love eating at this breakfast place.  The food is always good. My favorite waiter is Chris. He is courteous attentive & always remembers what I like to eat. He is a 5 star waiter!"}
{"text":"Whenever I go to Egg Works, which is often. I always want Chris SanAgustin to be my waiter. He is courteous and very attentive. He greets me pleasantly and even remembers my order, as I always eat the same thing. I believe he deserves a trip to Disneyland! Best waiter ever!"}
{"text":"Great food great service. Our waitress Victoria was very nice and attentive. Really enjoyed our family brunch."}
{"text":"It's got a home-y feel to it and huge pancakes. A bit out of my budget but we went because the kids got coupons from school. They have a cute train that runs around the whole place and my mimosa was yummy."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great food - thank you Maryann!  Dog friendly (Darwin - a chihuahua - felt very safe because they seated bigger dogs that came in away from us). Clean bathrooms. Carnivores will love the Country fried steak."}
{"text":"I'm not a breakfast person, but I love this place!  I usually order the Bacon, Ham, and Sausage skillet...and it is simply amazing. There's enough food for two people, or at least two meals. Not enough can be said about how amazing the Ranch Potatoes are. I'm not exactly sure what they put on them, but they are AMAZING.   The Seasoned Center Cut New York Steak is actually also pretty good as well, though not quite as satisfying as the aforementioned skillet."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good. Our server's name was Christopher and he was probably one of the most attentive servers I've ever had while not being overbearing.  Christopher recommended the Santa Cruz skillet to my fiancé and it was delicious. I had a mashed potato omelette because people on Yelp seemed to like it but it's not my cup of tea... But it was still delicious.  Bonus points: the banana nut muffins are incredible here!  :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and a vast array of tasty delights here! The Santa Cruz skillet is a favorite.  They have delicious signature banana muffins that come with all breakfast meals (almost all).  One of the few places in town that let's you substitute fruit instead of potatoes.  Also you can order half size orders if you don't want the humongous portions that they serve. The coffee is okay (I'm a snob though) but \"okay\" is better than the other crap they serve anywhere else. Plus you get your own thermos of it so you don't wait for refills.  PLUS they serve Cincinnati chili here. Pretty much can't go wrong with this choice!"}
{"text":"Marianne was awesome! Love this place! Try the Banana Nut french toast - delicious and enough for 2 people. Family friendly! Whenever family visit from out of town we always take them here."}
{"text":"Ate at Egg Works today for breakfast! Luanna was our waitress and her service was excellent! On top of her service all of our food came out correct and hot! I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Our first experience here at Egg Works. We had a delicious fruit plat that was very large. We split a delightful omelet. Just great and the best of service from Matt. Matt is very personable and always on the watch for our needs. We will be back! New fans."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and it was SO yummy!! Everyone had great customer service especially our server, Brady!! He was very attentive and always checked up on us whenever we needed something. The potatoes are SO GOOD!! And the banana nut muffin was delicious, must get! Will definitely be back whenever I go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Egg Works is difficult to rate. There's a lot to like here, but, at the end of the day, does the food taste good? Meh, I've experienced better.  The service has always been amazing. Thanks to the Egg card, I never have to wave anyone down. Just flip it and someone will be along. When you order coffee, it's $2.75. I find this to be pretty expensive. However, they bring you a whole carafe. They don't do said cubed fruit if you want an alternative to potatoes. Just freshly sliced, tasty fruit.  Portions are huge, and the hot sauce is so good I  bought it. The omelettes are huge, and made from high quality ingredients. Waitresses  have NO problem customizing your order within an inch of it's life.  Unfortunately, the food is bland. I love the potatoes, and the fruit.. But biscuits and gravy are a little off, the biscuit being too airy, and the gravy just missing something. The omelettes, no matter which one I get, never seem to have any flavor. Good ingredients, but they don't season it. To be honest, Baby Stacks is far better. Also, I'm not too excited about the whole \"Send your server to disneyland with a high review\"  thing. I think that's leading to this place being way over hyped."}
{"text":"I love egg works, simple as that. The food is always great and the customer service at all of their locations, especially sunset/eastern is top notch! I have tried a lot of the menu and my favorites are: Reuben sandwich, the Works Benny, and the chicken salad! Seasonally they offer carrot cake French toast which is to die for! Our waiter Perry was awesome, checked on us enough and was very friendly."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town hands down! I'm always stuck on what to order though cuz everything is so good. From the eggs benedict to their Hawaiian menu...you just can't go wrong! Ultra fast friendly staff with amazing service every time! Way to go guys...we'll be coming back for years!"}
{"text":"My friends and I wanted a place to eat breakfast and ended up spontaneously deciding on Egg Works. We did not expect much, but left after a decent meal. Nothing particularly stood out. The service was decent, not exceptional. The food reminded me of the kind served in casino cafe restaurants. Agreeable, but not outstanding."}
{"text":"Great place. Veronica was an outstanding waitress and deserves to go to Disneyland for her exemplary service in fulfilling the needs of our empty bellies."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service, great staff, and they have mimosas and bloody Mary's! What more could you ever ask for!!! Best place!"}
{"text":"Throughout the valley Egg works has always taken care of me, the location off Rainbow and Badura especially. Caitlin is usually the one to serve me and I am always very stoked to have her. Besides being on point and quick she's nice and remembers her regulars .  Great food is one thing, but great service from an awesome team allows you leave and return with a smile, keep it up everyone!!"}
{"text":"I come here for breakfast often. They offer coupons and are on Groupon occasionally so be on the look out. It's always busy on the weekends. If you plan to go between 9-11am (weekends), plan to wait at least 10-15 minutes.    PROS: Bacon & Avocado omelet             Corned Beef Hash             Eggs Benedict             Cincinnati Chili dog             Taco skillet             Fast service             Seeing the planes over our heads from the parking lot"}
{"text":"Go Candice! Great service.   The spinach bennie was really good, although it wouldve been better if the spinach had been sauteed as it usually is rather than raw. Still good though and the hollandaise was excellent.  We weren't impressed with the breakfast potatoes--just cubed potatoes with seasoning.   The banana nut muffin that everyone raves about was fantastic."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for breakfast, this place will hit the spot. Convenient location, great breakfast, friendly service and even better breakfast options.    We were immediately  seated upon entering. Dani our server had coffee was in my cup within minutes. Thanks to fellow yelpers ordering was a breeze. Ordered the stuffed French toast. I couldn't resist the picture of one that was previously posted. Awesome service from Dani, will definitely be back.   Tip: check in for a free banana muffin!"}
{"text":"I just ate at Egg Works for the first time and I can promise you, it will not be the last!! Although there were 5 other families before me, I didn't wait more than 10 min! They turn tables so quickly, there was never many people waiting. Not only is the food extremely flavorful with a great variety and some delicious alcoholic breakfast drinks, but I have NEVER experienced excellent service the way I have here EVER.  Heather was our server and she is a model employee. She was so upbeat and friendly despite how busy she was. She took time to chat with all her tables but still was attentive to all the others she had. I was astounded. I didn't have to ask for anything. I had refills before I even finished my drink! I asked to speak with her manager because as I said, I have never experienced such excellent service.  When I spoke with the general manager, Rochelle, she was thrilled to hear how pleased we were. I had to let her know that they were definitely doing something right here. Although, Heather herself was amazing, the ENTIRE staff never stopped moving! When one employee was at the POS putting orders in, others did not line up waiting to put their orders in. They would go find something else to do until the system was available. In just about every restaurant I have been in, fine and casual dining, employees always congregate and have personal side conversations. I did not see this happen once the entire time I was there. Maybe because Rochelle was constantly walking the floor and assisting in every way possible.  I am a huge fan of excellent service. The food is delicious, and delivered quickly, but the service I witnessed and received, was like no other! I have literally told just about every person I can about this place. It's too awesome to keep to myself!  Thank you Heather and Rochelle for a remarkable dining experience! I will easily become a regular so get used to seeing me!!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant. Food, breakfast, and muffins were all great. Obviously it was packed when we got there, we waited 15 mins and it was all worth it. The waitress asked us if it was our first time and we said yes and she gave us free muffins. Make sure you use the groupon discount if you are cheap like me!!! But I paid it back to the waitress as a tip. She was awesome!! Very attentive and helpful with making our choices.  We will go back again and will recommend them to friends and family!!"}
{"text":"This place is a 100% must. Christian D is an amazing waiter. He brought us samples muffins of their signature banana nut muffins and O. M. G. Their \"Habla Diablo\" is an exemplary seasoning. Such a great experience and a great way to wrap up our trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times. Possibly my FAVORITE breakfast place in the Southwest! Service is always great, food is always outstanding, and the prices are just right! The potatoes are always seasoned to perfection! I've never had a bad experience here and will continue to come back :)"}
{"text":"The set up and the atmosphere is very good here!!  you get plenty of food and you will definitely be full when you are done!  Get the Banana muffin ;)"}
{"text":"Had a amazing breakfast on Mother's Day. Our server Ashley H was very frendly and knowledgeable of the menu, reccomended the original Benny which was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I love Egg Works! I come here s couple of times a month. The food is always delicious and fast :) The service is great,  friendly and courteous :) Today our server was Brandt. He recommended some good additions to my meal, was attentive and friendly. All in all, another great experience at Egg Works :)"}
{"text":"Order the MUFFIN, not toast.  This place is the ideal breakfast restaurant you can commit yourself to visit on a weekly basis. I didn't get the name of my server, but he was phenomenal. He's the islander brotha that says \"brah\" a lot.  Ordered the avocado n bacon omelette and was not let down. It was filling and actually had avocado in it !  Overall experience was great, would definitely come back here. (I am not a local)"}
{"text":"I went to egg works this Sunday morning. We had a twenty minute wait which wasn't bad. They're awesome in that they send you a text when your table is ready and we had the greatest blessing to have Nicole as our server. I have special dietary restrictions and upon discovering midway my meal that I needed to change it, she had no qualms about suggesting quick substitutions. She is an amazing server and definitely deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"Oh Egg Works, how I love thee.  I have been to this particular Egg Works a handful of times and I love it each and every time. The staff rules, they always have a pot of coffee waiting for me, and the food never disappoints. From start to finish, the experience is awesome.  I usually get an omelet. Once, I ordered the Cincy Chili Skillet and it was AWESOME. Everything I get here is well made and delicious, including their fantastic banana nut muffins.  They don't rush you, despite how busy they are, and they always deliver service with a smile.  I appreciate that they show sports, even in the AM, on their TV's.   What I'm trying to say is: Eat here."}
{"text":"Usually if a restaurant wait is longer than 15 minutes, I'll mosey on over to the next option. Egg Works is the one exception to my rule. Ever since we've moved to Vegas, we utilized the full power of the Yelp community to assist us with finding our new \"regular\" joints. So mucho props to you all.  Like I said, the wait time is sometimes longer during the peak breakfast/brunch hours - but damn the wait is worth it. There's limited space inside for those waiting, so I'd avoid the busy times during the extreme Summer/Winter days.  The serving sizes are huge, so there's a nice \"half\" option for those of you without the hyper-asian metabolisms. Prices are reasonable and the menu selections will keep you wanting to try something new every time.  The one bummer thing is the hours. This being Las Vegas - I would assume they stay open late. I suppose it makes sense them serving breakfast food and all (they stop seating at 3PM). Their Loco Moco at 2AM would be friggin' epic.  Count us in as the new local regulars here!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast and lunch spot in a more commercial area of Vegas. There's a decent sized sign off of the main road here as the front of the restaurant faces the parking lot and its shared but there are plenty of spots. Both times I was there, it was busy but we got a table right away. There is counter seating too where you can watch the food came out of the kitchen. There are booths and tables as well. Hostess greets you on the way in and gets you seated. Very nice and accomodating here. Waitresses got to us right away for drinks. The menus are unique here. They are set up like a newspaper. Pretty cool idea. I've only gotten breakfast here but they have soups and sandwiches as well. The lastest you can get a table is 3 pm, so its a breakfast and lunch spot only.  The food is delicious and the portions are huge. Ive gotten the muffin with my breakfast both times and that tastes great. Its warmed up as well. Corned Beef Hash is good here. Not sure if its homemade or not but it was good. The \"diablo\" style home fries as well.  I'll be back soon hopefully."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Pretty solid breakfast place with a huge selection of different options. Big portions and friendly servers. Check in for a free banana nut muffin!   We stopped here before going to hike Red Rock, and for a pre-hike breakfast, this was definitely more than enough.   Food: I had the veggie skillet and another friend had the croissant breakfast sandwich. Both came with potatoes, which were a little dry. Veggie skillet is really big - could be breakfast enough for two people - and super filling, mostly because you get so many potatoes. The croissant bfast sandwich was also huge. But it's not a gourmet brunch by any means, and because the potatoes are dry, I'd say it's a little below typical diner breakfasts at a similar or a bit higher price point. My free banana nut muffin with check-in was so incredibly moist, it was amazing. Unlimited coffee refills!  Ambiance: Fast casual; our server was Sy and she was very attentive, speedy and helpful."}
{"text":"As soon as I sat down it was amazing I just ordered a meetcha lotta. Great staff  perfect location no problem finding. Great parking and LOVING THE FOOD"}
{"text":"I went to Egg works on a Saturday and it was really busy. I was surprised that we got seated quick. I ordered an scrambled eggs with seasoning potatoes. The dish was decent. The potatoes was well seasoned and flavorful but the scrambled eggs was lil bit salty and had a lot of cheese. If you want a classic American breakfast, look no further this is definitely a place to try out."}
{"text":"Extensive Hispanic inspired breakfast menu with a lot of seating and incredibly personable wait staff. I would definitely recommend a stop for breakfast; seems like a very local spot not too far away from the strip.   Banana nut muffin = super moist Bottomless Coffee - they leave a carafe on your table for convenience  Our server, Nicholas, was on top of everything."}
{"text":"Both my husband and I ordered the egg and cheese skillets. They were very yummy. PK was our server and was friendly and attentive. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Long lines usually on the weekends but they do their best to accommodate. And always worth the wait. Friendly service no matter what."}
{"text":"Favorite place to get a good wholesome breakfast! Forget IHOP, forget House of Pancakes. This is the place to be. Love the cajun fries that come with almost anything meal. And the bacon avocado omelette just melts in your mouth. Great spot to hit up for Sunday or any day of the week"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat they are open for breakfast and lunch but they are so good if you haven't tried it you should really give it a shot just thinking about it is making me hungry"}
{"text":"Love love love Egg Works. Although they seem to be constant bustling whenever I'm there, they somehow always manage to deliver excellent service with the friendliest of attitudes. Last time I was there, our server Bryna was very cool, and joked along with our normally goofy trio. She checked on us periodically as did the rest of the crew of bussers and managers. As usual, the food hit the spot for our brunch endeavors (I picked the Portuguese sausage and eggs with a side of my all-time favorite banana muffin from the islander menu--highly recommended!) and I walked away with the satisfaction I always expect from Egg Works."}
{"text":"Great food! This place is always packed but it is well worth the wait. Wife had the original breakfast burrito. It's a no frills meal, egg, cheese and potatos in a tortilla. Did I say potato? Man, they overload the plate with potatos that invariably have to take home. I wonder how many potatoes get thrown out but I digress.....  I had the Reuben. It's a decadent sandwich done just how I like it. The potato salad (did I say potato) is killer. The mustard in the potato salad takes it over the top (reminds me of a good Southern style potato salad).   Definitely a place to go for good comfort food."}
{"text":"The meals are  great you do not leave hungry.  Ask for Ashley she is a perky joyful server."}
{"text":"Mariyah was a really great server to us. Just came here for a quick bite, and was greeted with amazing service. She was so sweet and kind; made me want to come back here again! Ordered the Loco Moco and it was extremely delicious."}
{"text":"I go to this place EVERY SINGLE TIME I VISIT LAS VEGAS!!  I have never been let down!  The service is FAST and friendly.  The portions are huge, so bring your appetite!  Can't say enough good about this place.  I just wish they would open one near my home!"}
{"text":"My first time in here and the food and service was outstanding! Brady was an excellent server and took very good care of us.  I ordered \"the Works\" omelette and a banana nut muffin and they were outstanding!  We had to wait 10 minutes to be seated but it was worth it.  The place was full but they were efficient in handling us."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.  Egg Works is another good option for a reliable breakfast in Las Vegas.  They have 4-5 locations around the area and is a sister restaurant to Egg & I.  We came at about noon on a Sunday and had a surprisingly short wait of only 10 minutes which is very atypical for the \"Egg\" restaurants which are usually pretty busy and a normal 20-30 minute wait.    The best parts that I enjoyed were the omelette's size (4 eggs) and the banana nut muffin.  Truly one of the better muffins you can get for breakfast at any restaurant.  It's not crispy on the top, which I usually enjoy for the crunch, but still tasted awesome.  The omelette was a little too cheesy but overall tasty and big.  As far as service, the waitress was very welcoming (if not too welcoming, asking about refills and such literally every five minutes) but the food took very long to get served.  Usually \"Egg\" restaurants have very quick turnover and cook fast, but it took nearly 35 minutes for a crepe and an omelette.  The muffin came out first so there was some type of an appetizer, but the food itself was remarkably tardy.    The price was around $25 for two full meals which is typical of most breakfast joints in Las Vegas.  I had a tasty meal and I still recommend Egg Works, but expect to wait to get seated and I guess at this location to be served as well."}
{"text":"Today I experienced the best eggs in LAS VEGAS!!!!! Our server BAMBI was sooo nice and patient! (There was 4 of us) LOL! The barn  theme for  the restaurant was soooo kute!!! I loved the food!!!! I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service, very attentive and amazing food. Only flaw was the price of hair I found laying on top of my potatoes. GROSS!"}
{"text":"After driving around the area looking for a breakfast spot, we decided on coming to Egg Works.  It was my first time and I really enjoyed my food.  Upon walking in, I was taken aback by the decor.  It seemed a bit dark and cluttered with a bunch of random images of eggs throughout the restaurant.  There were TV's around the area as well.  Got seated and the waitress provided us with menus and asked for our drinks.  Looked at the menu (which is in a newspaper format - pretty creative) and was overwhelmed by the amount of breakfast items on the menu.  Took me about 10 minutes to decide on a dish.  Ended up getting the california crepe.  The crepe was thin and had a good proportion of egg to meats.  The avocado was the kicker.  I tend to order due to specific items within the dish and the avocado really made it taste great. (of course, the bacon helped as well).  Other dishes our group ordered included the loco moco, which was a bit salty and the banana nut french toast, which was very very (maybe too) moist.  One thing I did notice was that they had great servers and they had a little paddle on each table that lets you indirectly ask for the servers to come.  It seemed pretty creative as well but probably not utilized as often since it is just easier to ask for a server.  I want to come back and try the other items.  The food is pretty good and it seems to be very popular so maybe there are better items on the vast menu that I can order."}
{"text":"We went here and it was very disappointing.  My HUSBAND had the vegetarian skillet and the veggies were cold with a very sad melted cheese on top. I ordered pancakes and Bisquick makes better tasting pancakes!!! I will never go there again and the sad thing is we live down the street.  Ugh never again!!!"}
{"text":"meh.  When I eat out I want something I can't make/is expensive to make at home.  Everything very normal here, and for our family it was $$$ - won't be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast!!! Service fast, and kind!!a litle line at the door , but is ok. Also the coffe is good .my server CANDICE!!!! Is so profesional in her job, she is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Even though it's packed and super busy all the servers were so nice. From the host to our waitress to our cash register lady. You all are amazing.  I got a bit overwhelmed since the menu had so many options. I just went with what I usually love which is Huevos Rancheros BUT I asked my server Leighlani what she recommended. Through her advice, I was able to eat the best Huevos Rancheros in my life. I got it with carnitas, green sauce, side of rice, beans and egg was over easy. It's a pretty big portion so share with another if you can.  Ok good night! Food coma time."}
{"text":"One of the better breakfast places on this side of town, good selection, nice staff, not too busy"}
{"text":"I LOVE EGG AND I!!!!! They have the best customer service !!! My boyfriend and I used to go every Monday it got to the point the girl up front noticed I would wait for him to arrive from his Monday meetings. Lol they are always so pleasant, polite and always make sure were taken care of. Thanks guys for making our fresh Monday a great start!"}
{"text":"Enjoying a weekend with my buddy who he lives in Vegas. This is one of his favorite spots and I understand why.  Service was great and food was also very tasty.  The menu is printed on a newspaper.  I ordered the works scramble with wheat toast. Lots of good!  The food was brought it pretty quickly even though the place was packed. I can't harp on how often the waiter stopped by to check on us.  Definitely a place to return to."}
{"text":"This one along with Eggs & I are all of the same restaurant \"family\". We came here with the family for brunch after church. We came around 10:40 and the line was packed but moved quickly. I'd say we waited around 10 minutes.   I highly recommend the skillets - they have different variations but the basics are: potatoes, bell peppers, onions, cheese, egg to top it off. The variable is chicken, steak, veggies, chili, etc. very filling. For those with smaller bellys, I recommend sharing. Also, if you check in on yelp it's a free banana nut muffin that you can't go wrong with.   The service was good and I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I used to come here at least once or twice a week before I would go to work. I always sit at the counter since I am usually by myself and in a hurry to go to work. To me there is nothing worse than going to a restaurant and them making you feel like a loner. Every time I come in here the staff is amazing! They always talk to me and recognize me, which is a huge plus in my book. There is one man specifically who seems to be always there when I am and he is one of the best servers I have ever had. I wish I could remember his name, he's told me several times, but I'm the worst with names! The food here is always great and comes out very quickly. I am usually in and out of here within 30 minutes, which is perfect for someone who is always on the go like me! Another great thing is they offer half sizes. Definitely take advantage of this if you're not trying to go into foodcoma after breakfast because their portions are HUGE!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but for all the hype I would think it would be better. It's the same at going to ihop to me. As for the prices, there reasonable for the Quality of the food"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best and has amazing service! If you haven't been here you don't know what your missing. You must give it a try!!! Thank you guys for the excellent food and great menu options. You guys rock"}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times and I tell you, today did not disappoint. The food was excellent (I'm in love with their potatoes and banana nut muffin!!); and our server Heather was personable, funny and attentive. From sit down to walk out we were impressed with the service and environment. Do yourself a favor and stop on in!!"}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp after a quick search.  We were looking for something close to the airport on our way out of town.  We were not disappointed!  Everything here was off the chart.  When asked if we had been here before, we told our server, Donna, no.  She promptly greeted us with a warm, homemade banana muffin.  It was ridiculously good.  I had the country \"Benny\".  To me, the sign of a good breakfast joint is whether or not they know how to make good country gravy.  Again, theirs was better than most.  The potatoes were awesome and it felt like they gave you about 3 pounds worth.  If you are looking for a great breakfast, don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty consistently good...especially the muffins.  We substitute their tasty potatoes for refried beans...don't get me wrong.  I love potatoes but it can really add to your waste line (or muffin top - haha) if you're eating badly all the time."}
{"text":"I Always enjoy finding new breakfast places, and this place was awesome! I got the stuffed French toast with eggs,bacon and sausage with the house made potatoes and it was wonderful and so filling. The banana muffin they give you to start was seriously amazing! I swear I would come here just for that. The coffee is so so but they have flavored creamers which is nice. The place is a very casual but they have large booths good for groups. The staff was friendly and checked on us often. I look forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"Service was awesome. There were 4 of us, 1 meal wasn't up to standard (salty) and they comped it without hesitation. We bought something else and it was awesome. My point is that we love love good service and this place got an A+."}
{"text":"Always awesome service and fabulous food. We love sitting outside so the 2 year old can watch the planes go by. Ashley kept us happy. See you soon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places to take people too. The service has always been great and the food is decent priced and taste was satisfying. I even bought their potato seasoning. I had the country fried steak with banana nut muffin. This restaurant is in a good location as well."}
{"text":"Had our team building breakfast here and it was awesome! Heather was our server and she was great! Food was excellent as well. Great portions! It was egg-sactly what we wanted :-)"}
{"text":"I had the bacon avocado omelette with sour cream and it was delicious! My mom went for the Portuguese sausage egg plate and she loved her meal. Our server Kat was so friendly and helpful! Love this place!"}
{"text":"What more do you want. This place is clean fast and efficient. The menu is awesome featuring breakfast items they also have salads,burgers,pizza and lots more food options. There are a few options for vegans and vegetarians . My favorite is the prime rib Benny. Expect a small wait on the weekends. I highly recommend the egg and I."}
{"text":"Really Egg Works? I am so disappointed. This chunk of hair in my food is so huge, it seems it was put there intentional. There goes my favorite restaurant. Ugh!"}
{"text":"this place is so good..amazing food and dont let me get started on our waitress heather :-) wow, absolutely thee best waitress ever..so very friendly and thee best customer serive..she went above and beyond our expectations :-) thank you heather :-)"}
{"text":"Jazmin! We visited your location 2/17/18!  Your service was amazing and the food is always delish!  The very best breakfast in town and the best prices!  Do go see Jazmin and please enjoy the best breakfast ever!"}
{"text":"The service us great! Love the atmosphere. The potatoes have their spice in them, little too much spice for my wife and I. Portion is large and well worth the money. However, I did take some home for breakfast at work the next day, I did not order the 4 inch grey hair though, yep, a hair. Disgusting! Shouldn't they have hair nets on, I can't stand finding hair in my food, especially when it's not mine!!! For this reason, we will never, ever, go here again. I'm nauseous as I'm typing this review. I'm sure it was one in a million, but I'll save my odds for Mega Bucks"}
{"text":"First time in here for breakfast and it was pretty good, I got the Chicken Fried Steak (they call it country fried) and it was perfectly cooked, crunchy and hot. The country gravy was the best I've had in a long time. The breakfast potatos were good, but a little plain and skimpy. Everything was seasoned so at least bland flavors were not in their repetoire. Very good service and prompt in everyway. A cup of coffee is $2.75 and they do leave a large decanter full so you never have to ask for refills, but it does kind of boost the check total up a bit. First timers like me may wonder where the menu is, but it is right there under the silverware, disquised as a thin newspaper. There is a wide variety on the menu including Hawaiian breakfast like loco moco and others. The breakfast burrito sounds good and I will have to try that next time. Location is a bit off since it is located way south on Eastern, so if you are coming off the 215 you will probably pass a dozen or more places for breakfast until you reach this location, but they do have a following on the other side of town so this is a welcome addition to the sea of restaurants located on Eastern Ave in Henderson."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's your typical breakfast diner, and we usually prefer to sit at the counter.  The food is always excellent.  I usually get a spinach, mushroom and cheese scramble with breakfast potatoes.  The potatoes are seasoned and absolutely amazing.  The OJ is a little expensive, but it's usually expensive everywhere so I guess that's typical.  The better value is to split a carafe. The only complaint I have is that I wish it was open later that 3pm.  Another thing I like about this place is the little flip over eggs, to let your server know you need help. They are on every table and come in handy."}
{"text":"Sarah was our server ! She was so awesome and brought my dogs a bowl of water without me asking! Best food and best service"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfasts! You can get the country potatoes plain but they come with seasoning so you have to ask for plain."}
{"text":"Candice was amazing! Shes so bubbly and very helpful! We had never been before. The food was great and the service was fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Mario is the server you need, cordial, friendly, and fast.  My well done NY steak was perfect.  Corned beef hash was the best, according to my very picky husband. My son loved his stuffed French toast.   Superb.  Going to come here every time we are in Vegas.  It's a huge place so even though there was a lot of people waiting, we were seated pretty quickly.   Thank you all!!!"}
{"text":"We have the Sundance special.  4.5 stars.  Healthy.  Tasty.  Cajun potato's yummy. Gumbalaya.  4.5 stars.  Authentic.  Tasty. Carrot cake toast.  4 stars."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic and Nicole is awesome!  We brought a hungry morning crew ready to chow and no one was disappointed. The menu is a bit overwhelming, but they have the staples and a ton of cool variants, making the menu hard to beat. Our group had a breakfast burrito, two different kinds of bennys, a traditional eggs and sausage and wonderful banana muffins. And oh those potatoes.  Really delicious and a super friendly staff. Thanks Nicole!"}
{"text":"Breakfast, one of my favorite meals of the day. Ha! I can't say I'm all that impressed with their breakfast dishes, but there were some positive highlights.  First, our server Maria G. was an angel. Once again, a lackluster meal is made better by a great employee - thank you Maria!   Back to food. I really, highly suggest NOT getting a crepe. The egg part was weird and spongy. Pancake-y might be a better description. Also not a fan of their house made chorizo, which was bland with strange texture. I almost choked on globs of cheese inside the crepe omelette- seriously. Coffee was too watered down for me, and I really dislike non-dairy creamer, would much prefer a tiny cup of cream. Back to the positive notes, I was a fan of their spiced potatoes (spice was similar to Lawry's) and their bottled Salsa Verde helped flavor up the bland Mexican Omelette. They do HALF orders, and it was A LOT of food, so glad our server mentioned that before ordering! We enjoyed a free banana muffin with our checkin (yay!!) I think the fella's basic breky looked far better than mine, so back to the basics it will be."}
{"text":"I love breakfast diners! Especially when their food is amazing. Seasoned potatoes are a must have with your meal. If you can manage, a warm banana bread muffin also hits the spot with your meal."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!!  Great service, fast and friendly!!!  Our server Danielle was really nice and attentive!!!  I had the Mexican Omelette with extra cilantro and a banana nut muffin...very delicious and a great price!!!  I would definitely recommend this for travelers coming to Vegas and it's very close to the airport!!!"}
{"text":"decent breakfast place.  i like the 'happy face, sad face' egg that signifies you need service.  caution, though - if you show the sad face egg, the waitress gets a bid sad-faced, herself.  i'm not a huge fan of the newspaper menu - seems wasteful.  also, the fruit plate could use more berries and less melon, but i do like that they give you a whole pitcher of coffee.  definitely someplace i continue to go, but there's other bfast places in town i enjoy more."}
{"text":"Although they had a long wait, it still is a very nice place to go out to breakfast.  My omelet was much better quality than most others.  I like how they melted cheese on top, too.  It was fluffier than I can make myself at home.  I like how they allowed sliced tomatoes as an alternative to home fries.  When you order an omelet, you are usually avoiding refined carbs anyway.  My server was very attentive and got me exactly what I ordered.  The only negative is that we felt rushed.  I understand that they need to turn the tables quickly, but putting the check on my table when I just got the meal is too rushed for me.  After a long wait, I don't want the meal to be over in 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and every single time the food is just as my very first time there. It's great! The service here is really good for the most part."}
{"text":"I love eggs, and after reading the reviews for this place I knew I had to give it a try.  The food was great here.  My boyfriend and I shared the veggie benny and the avocado bacon omelet.  Both were great.  My favorite part was the banana nut muffin.  It was served warm right after we ordered.  Unfortunately, our server was forgetful and unfocused, but I'm willing to forgive that since the food was so good.  He was also really nice.  :)"}
{"text":"Well my associate decided that we come to this place and have breakfast due to me being hungry and him obviously having it before.. So I decided to give it a go..  I ordered the eggs Benedict with turkey bacon and breakfast potatoes with country gravy on the side, along with a cup of coffee..  I was give a fresh hot pot of coffee which was a plus for me being a coffee lover.. My eggs Benedict I would have it say was alright on a scale 1-10 I would say a 5. My potatoes where cooked the way I asked but however It seemed as if they where extremely salty to much for my liking..  After its all said and done I can say I've came I've ate and I don't think I would be in a hurry to return for a second round.. Nothing bad, it's not a first choice either.."}
{"text":"Consistently good food.  Had the Sundance Special. Nice and light. Just an amazing breakfast place."}
{"text":"Had brunch with mother in law and the bf! The food was amazing. Had the bacon avocado omelette. It was fabulous, glad to see this place is not stingy about their toppings. The free banana muffin was yummy. Overall service was great as well. Recommend coming here. We will be back."}
{"text":"Fast, great service! Food was timely, orange juice was yummy. 1y/o friendly type place. Good atmosphere for some breakfast. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review about Egg Works for a while now, but I have had such stable, basic experiences, I have not had much to write home about.  I am not giving this place five stars for taste, decor, or any of the usual reasons. Weird, right? I know. Just go with it.  I am giving them five stars because of how successful Egg Works does their job. They serve great food, for great prices. I have never had any major issues with service. And this location has plenty of visible TV's to watch the game on Sundays.  What's not to love? I thought about giving them four stars because it's not like I come here and I'm blown away by the taste, or ingredients, wine list or Michelin stars. But what this place does, it does very well. If you want a hardy, filling breakfast for a no-nonsense price, then Egg Works achieves it every time.  The bf and I always come late, because we are not morning people. I have never had to wait when arriving between 11:30 and 3."}
{"text":"Pretty good.   Everyone in my party was satisfied.   I only got eggs and yummy sourdough toast this time but have been here many times before. Stuffed French toast Italian sandwich and Mexican skillets are all yummy!!!! They offer half portions that are huge too!!!! They have flavored coffee creamers too!   Won't hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and service! When were in town we always make it a point to come here. Everything on the menu that we have tried was really delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was EGG-ceptional. Got the stuffed french toast with mimosas. Food and service were EGG-CELLAnt. Lol. I'd definitely reccomend."}
{"text":"We love this place for breakfast! Always wonderful. Veronica was and eggscellent server! My four year even said so."}
{"text":"Food was great and came out quick as always. PK, as always, was AMAZING! Always happy and there with a big smile on his face. Thank you PK!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the train. Food was delicious service was mediocre. Potatoes el diablo were cooked perfect!"}
{"text":"French toast was bland and lacking texture. Service was good. They don't take AMEX! For those who still \" don't leave home without it\". LOL"}
{"text":"We used to eat at Egg Works on the weekends when we 1st moved to Las Vegas. We are glad that they finally moved one to our side of the valley.  The service here is good and the  staff is always solid when we come in with our big parties. One server that always goes above and beyond is PK. Always friendly and attentive. My wife points out that we never have to ask PK to refill our drinks and that is big...happy wife happy life LOL. They have an egg sign on the table, one side is black and the other is yellow, if you need help you flip it to yellow. We've never used it with PK, which tells you guys- request for the guy. He won't disappoint.  We could come here for just coffee and those awesome banana muffins. The wife and kids love it. Its served warm, it's moist, and not too sweet. There are many occasions that we have ordered a bunch of these muffins just for our morning meetings.  The Loco Moco is another winner. We don't remember this being on the menu when we 1st ate at Egg Works, but we are glad its on the menu now. Loco Moco is from Hawaii- 1st layer is sticky rice, next a hamburger patty, eggs your way (i suggest over easy), and doused with delicious brown gravy. You could also sub out the meat if you want- you can substitute for spam or sausage. We've ordered the portuguese sausage (a little spicy, not too bad), eggs, & rice.... simple local breakfast. The parental units always get pancakes, eggs, & bacon. They give the thumbs up.  The weekends get pretty crowded, so make sure you go early. They have 1st come 1st serve seats at their bar style area where you can also watch news or sports. They have takeout, but breakfast is always better eaten while sitting down.  Stop reading and go eat breakfast already. Tick tock tick tock... hurry up"}
{"text":"So much good food. We all took home half of our plates. Recommend the fries over the tater tots with anything. The banana muffin that comes with the meal was tasty and huge too!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places in Henderson. The food is really good and those breakfast potatoes are to die for!  Oh and I can't forget that banana nut muffin they serve that comes with certain dishes.  When they bring it to you, it's nice and warm and goes so well with your coffee!  My favorite new items on the menu are the Hawaiian breakfast dishes (spam with eggs and rice, Portuguese sausage, and I can't remember the other one; there are only 3). It's good food, inexpensive, and the waiters are really attentive.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I had heard great things and it has a high rating. Our server had no idea about the menu when we asked what their signature dish was she had no idea, when we asked what was good she stumbled and said \"ummmm everything\". Once we got our food she just came by to give us our bill and that was it not to check if everything was good or even check on our drinks. Our food was good but service was horrible would never go back."}
{"text":"They were the first restaurant I was taken too last year, now it's weekly thing. Great staff and good food. Just smile, everyone does."}
{"text":"Excellent Food and service. Maria, our server, suggested a smaller crepe and I was glad she did. The smaller one was big and more than enough. Thanks Maria."}
{"text":"After a morning of early travel, once we got our rental car we yelped to find a breakfast spot since we were starving!  Yelp did good. There was a slight wait and we sat the bar. Shantel was our server and was awesome. I always judge good service by not having to ask for a refill, which I never had to with her. She also made a good recommendation for their green salsa which was very delish!  I had the corned beef hash and husband had an omelet. We also split blueberry pancakes - yummy! The meal totally hit the spot. It's a cool atmosphere and doesn't feel touristy (even though we were-lol). We will most definitely be back the next time or even again on our trip.  It was eggs-cellent."}
{"text":"Mariyah was very welcoming had great service definitely will be coming back.... Food was great thanks!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I go here every time I come from Cali! I use to come here with my mom and now to remember her I come with my new little family! Bought my new born on our last trip to Vegas! I lost my mom 2 years ago to cancer but this will always be one of our favorite spots to go to when in Vegas! Love it here! Food, staff, decor did I mention the food! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Family reunion. The staff was so kind to put us in a separate room for our large party. Big portions of food. The menu is massive, but luckily our group doesn't mind sharing. Egg-cellent!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Cali and we can't not stop in this place for amazing breakfast options! We skip the buffet for this place!! Our server Mariia was great! Super friendly and all of her recommendations were exact to our liking! The chile relleno omelet was sooo good and tasty!! Plus the portions are huge!!!!! And the banana nut muffins are the best I have ever had!! Thank you again Mariia for the egg-celent and friendly service!!!"}
{"text":"i did expect more of a menu, but then again nothing else mattered after I saw the mashed potato ommelette ok the menu. I used to get it at a small local place but it shut down and nobody else serves it...until now!!!! Muffins are not as good as what the RJ says and the chilli is kind of bland. Stick to the mashed potato ommelette and take a long walk afterwards. gravy are good also."}
{"text":"I go to the Egg Works restaurants every now and then for a banana nut muffin and buckwheat pancakes with sugar free syrup after an intense workout session.  I love that they offer buckwheat.  I swear it is a true super food, and I've seen some nice growth in my legs after consuming these for postworkout carbs on leg day.  I've had the blueberry buckwheat pancakes and diced apple/cinnamon buckwheat pancakes.  If you like buckwheat, they are great. I could even eat them without the sugar free syrup. I really love them.  For me, the banana nut muffin lives up to the hype.  It's just as good as it looks and it's as good as any good review says it is.  I cannot, however, speak on anything else on the menu. Go buckwheat!"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday morning brunch. After eating all weekend on the strip I was so glad to go to a non rape pricing place. We ordered a scramble a short stack with blueberries and a skillet. Everything came out great and the banana nut muffin warm and amazing. The coffee was something that could use work tasted like foldgers to me. However the flavored creamers made up for it lol.   4 people 51.00 plus tip. Service was great food was good. Definitely would go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I ate at egg works a few months ago in hopes of it living up to its stellar reviews. The staff was extremely friendly and there was nothing particularly wrong with cleanliness or service. The food was just subpar, and I don't understand the hype. I'd be open to going again but I truly hope I have a better tasting plate of food."}
{"text":"the customer service was great, our server, Chris, was exceptional, thank you Egg Works. it was eggs-actly what I wanted :)"}
{"text":"Good service but the food was nothing special.  Nothing was bad but nothing was wow...  We would be back but the long wait to be seated we expected more."}
{"text":"I have had their CornHash and their Bloody Mary both great. Their french toast are good and their hispanic entrees are also great, tasty and authentic."}
{"text":"I've ordered my food to go for lunch 3 times. Each time I called in and was extremely specific on the item I was ordering. It was wrong every time. If you call in they ask you when you'll be there to pick it up. Well, plan on them loosing your order, making you wait 12 minutes at the to go counter (bar) before someone notices you, then puts your order in. Then plan on waiting another 15 minutes so, the cook can get to your order, then wait another 10 for someone to notice your food sitting there getting cold, 3 minutes someone to package it and then wait in line to pay. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Really busy for a regular day. Servers were very attentive. My only beef was that the people next to us were loud. I guess they don't have control about that. I recommend the bacon and avocado omelet."}
{"text":"It was late morning so by now everything was appetizing to me . The place was not really busy I ordered one of their  omelet everything was ok until they brought me the banana nut muffin my friend and I stared at each other in front of me was this muffin that looked like somebody bit a part of. I was going to keep quiet but I wanted bread with my omelette so I called the attention of the waiter i showed him the muffin and he started to give me a lecture on how the muffins get deformed when you take them out of the pan.Well it was my muffin and I'm eating it i want to make sure that no one has taken a bite off it for sanitary purposes . I would have been happy with I am sorry   I can get you another one.After the lecture I decided to just eat my my omelette without the muffin.My friend who was treating me couldn't believe it so he left a small tip.Im from the service industry also and i would have not served the muffin in the first place. Sorry I'm going back to the one in Sunset."}
{"text":"I like coming here for breakfast the food is good. They have a banana nut muffin which is so good,they also have mimosas that's a bonus and at times you can find a groupon deal for them."}
{"text":"Really needed someplace to get a decent breakfast and finish some work from back home remotely on a decent WiFi connection.  This place is one of the most well run places I've seen when it gets really busy. Customers are consistently piling in and the servers are multitasking and helping each other.  Perry helped me out and was quick to get my order and asked during my stay if I needed anything. Keep in mind, I was here for more than a few hours.  The country fried steak was well portioned, with the spicy potatoes, and scrambled eggs.  I'm glad I stopped in and encourage any other traveler, local, or wanderer to give them a look.  I think they're a big deal, but what do I know, I'm from Michigan."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I usually go with any of the Benny's which are super yummy. Their potatoes are awesome and the banana muffin is to die for! Definitely try this if you're wanting a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Come on people really if you haven't eaten at egg works for breakfast then u dont like breakfast... this place never fails me... the service is exceptional here.. the staff always very friendly...  Where do I start.. well the last time I was in there I had the tacos Ranchero which is basically huevos Ranchero with a pile of taco meat on top. Can't go wrong there.  Sometimes I go with the breakfast tostada which is a giant flour tortilla baked into the shape of a bowl the filled with beans their signature potatoes scrambled eggs and taco meat topped with tons of cheese salsa and sour cream f**k that's delicious. I've tried everything from their Hawaiian favorites like Loco moco to the French Toast and nothing has ever failed me... and don't forget about the banana muffin so good all warm with butter running down it...   Damnn I shouldn't have wrote this when I was hungry and egg works is closed at 3pm.."}
{"text":"My first Review so Suck Up Tha Positive Vibes!!!  Who would have known that a Breakfast could be so Good!!!  First of all I had my doubts about this place.  It is on the Corner of Sunset and Eastern in a business complex that seems empty most of the time.  I don't even look in that direction when driving down sunset.  But when you walk up to the restaurant and see a sea of people waiting to be seated, you know that something must be going right.  Yet our wait at the back of 15 people only took about 15 - 20 minutes...crazy.  Once seated you can usually judge the entire visit by how fast you are asked for your drink order.  3 minutes (yes I usually time it) is all it took for a very friendly person to ask and another 3 minutes to have my coffee and orange juice delivered in front of me.    I ended up ordering the Carnitas (which was recommended by our server) which was incredible.  Pricing wasn't cheap (I think the Carnitas was about $11 and coffee $2.50) but is definetely worth it for the portion and flavor.    Honestly I have to give this place 5 stars which normally never happens.  I usually pick apart an establishment because I truly believe in Great Customer Service when dining out.  Food, though extremely important, comes second. Egg Works was extremely busy with people buzzing in and out and our server never skipped a beat.  There was such a smooth flow to all the craziness that you don't see anywhere.    If you are looking for somewhere great to eat, with great food, and awesome service....You have to stop by and Try this place.  OH and I almost forgot....THEY PLAY SUNDAY FOOTBALL ON THE FLAT SCREENS THAT ARE HANGING EVERYWHERE!!!"}
{"text":"Price you pay is worth the portion. Food is great! Chorizo burrito was a hit, but the sauce they put on it was a little much. Regular kids plate was an adult size. My husband had the spinach omelette that was huge! Side of potatoes were seasoned perfectly. I however did not like my club burger. Taste like fake beef. Almost like a oversized ampm burger. The fries made up the difference tho. Next time will stick to breakfast items."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast / brunch spot. Although busy, they always serve up fast, friendly, delicious plates. Generous servings."}
{"text":"Nothing but the best when we eat here. Lexie, our server, was great. Super sweet and attended to our every need. The chefs did amazing making our food and it was out on the table really fast. I had the French toast with bacon, eggs and a side of breakfast potatoes. My partner had the sunrise mountain.  Because this beautiful brunch spot is in the heart of summerlin, the view is pretty nice. The air is clean and you can hear the birds/cars drive by with ease. Super peaceful breakfast and I love seeing the dogs out on the patio. Although they get in the way sometimes, they really help make the experience that much more enjoyable. My partner and I have eaten here many times, and we plan on continuing. Love this place and remember to get your Groupon/coupon. There is one located in the Review Journal and the other on the app."}
{"text":"This breakfast and brunch restaurant was introduced to me by my boyfriend. It was a fun experience, not over-the-top amazing but very mellow. Considering it was morning and we were barely beginning our day, the mellow and chill mood was very much appreciated. The food was amazing, I made my own omelette whilst my boyfriend order steak and eggs. I highly recommend their muffin as well, really scrumptious. Overall, the wait was to a minimum, their service was consistent, food didn't take too long to arrive at our table, and the prices were fair. Overall a good experience :)"}
{"text":"My first time trying Egg Works and I must say, this place wins at everything.  Starting from the friendly staff,  especially our waitress Tanya!  The food is amazing.  My friends got the Corn Beef & Hash, and I got the Cinnamon raisin French toast.  It was sweetand filling, even the apple compote on the side was good!  Hands down the best breakfast we've ever had."}
{"text":"Two great things about Egg Works: Our waitress, Donna, and the banana nut muffins!! We felt very welcomed and cared for. Thanks, Donna! Also liked the potatoes! Really good seasoning on them!  Thanks for a nice \"5 year anniversary\" breakfast!"}
{"text":"Yummy.  food was delicious.  service is prompt and friendly.  we were staying at an airbnb (no coffee pot) and when i came in asking for coffee, they were johnny on the spot with my caffiene fix!  hubby and I should have split (but didn't - haha).  the servings are ridiculously big and every bite is delicious.  the omelette is made of four eggs so I asked if there was any way for a two-egg omelette.  \"absolutely\" was our sweet server's answer.  Still even the two egg omelette was BIG.  I had the chili relleno omelette.  YumYum,  Their banana muffins are really good too."}
{"text":"Eden mi server,fue muy atento y muy amable al recivirnos se preocupava que nuestra comida estubiera bien,me voy muy contenta de este lugar,la comida Es muy deliciosa,tiene muy buena presentacion,seguro que bolvere."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. The food was excellent and the service was even better. Veronica took great care of us. Always nice to see a happy face in the morning. Ask for Veronica when you come here!"}
{"text":"We had our dogs with us on this trip so we opted for Egg Works because they are dog friendly and they had good YELP reviews.  We had a very nice server and we enjoyed the food, but it was nothing special.  It was pretty cool watching the airplanes coming so close as they were landing."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty standard. I had a ham and cheese omelette with avocado slices and potatoes. The food was good....Not great. The one thing I didn't like about it was the seating arrangement. No booths, chairs were uncomfortable, and the tables are small. However, the waiter was super nice and very welcoming"}
{"text":"My fave breakfast spot! The chicken fried steak skillet and the breakfast burrito are the bomb. Veronica, one of the servers is also super sweet and nice!"}
{"text":"Food is always great, and our server Ariel made it even better! Best potatoes here, and the relleno omelette was delicious, although my sausage was very greasy it was a great experience :)"}
{"text":"Back........... Was here with wife and friend. Another Great breakfast at EGG WORKS. I country fried steak and eggs. And they had the classic breakfast. Every thing was perfect. Waitress was very good. This is a very comfortable breakfast place to enjoy great food and company."}
{"text":"Five stars for Vanessa. She deserves a trip to Disneyland! She was very friendly and kind."}
{"text":"It has been months since we were in Vegas and we stopped at Egg Works on our way to the airport and the wife is still raving about the Banana Nut French toast.  I believe if we lived in Vegas we would have gone there another dozen times.  The wait was about 15 minutes to get sat but well worth it, service was fast and friendly, the menu had a good variety of unique items, and the food was tasty.  As mentioned the wife loved her french toast, I got the Chicken Enchilada omelet and a bloody Mary, both were very good."}
{"text":"I love breakfast. I love eggs. This place has probably the lowest quality mass-production factory eggs Ive ever had.  I ordered the \"portuguese sausage\" plate & it definitely was not portuguese sausage. Very low quality, super greasy & tastes nothing like the real thing.  The couple stars are only because our waitress was very nice & timely, and their potatoes are seasoned & cooked pretty well."}
{"text":"This place is really packed in the mornings so we ended up getting a late brunch and were seated right away. They have a huge menu that'll satisfy just about any craving you may have. I got their Sundance Omelette, which was very well prepared with just enough of everything. It had artichokes, spinach, mushrooms, chicken, tomatoes and cheese! And all tasted delicious! Girlfriend got an eggs Benny as usual and enjoyed it, nothing crazy special, but it tasted good. Overall good experience"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Will go back again. Plenty to eat before our flight to punta cana."}
{"text":"My family and I love coming here for breakfast or lunch. Great food and nice waiters/waitresses. Can't say enough to good things about their food. I always get the eggs, turkey bacon, country potatoes and muffin... Seems easy but it's amazing. Definitely recommend coming here to eat."}
{"text":"got the Italian skillet, came from Cali.  best diner I've ever had. great service. Ashley was our server, she did awesome with getting all our food to us on time."}
{"text":"Food was not that great but decent. The three stars are mainly because the service. Waitress Nicole was awesome an attentive Food also came out quick."}
{"text":"Raul is egg-cellent!!! He got egg-actly what we wanted!!! This is our Fourth time here. I've been ordering eggworks specials one at a time and this time , I got the charred-broiled porkchops. My wife ordered the the traditional benny and forgot that she needed the eggs to be cooked all the way because we are egg-pecting another one.. Raul replaced the order right away because he understood. As egg-pected everything was perfect!!"}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint!!! Staff are friendly, food is always delicious.. can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Third time returning to egg works. What's great about this location are the servers, every visit it's a 10/10. Today I had the pleasure of Nicole taking care of our table. Super sweet and friendly gal.   Sat down order some coffee and my all time fav hash with super well done burnt potatoes and my muffing too. Served pretty quick, and never a disappointment in taste or portion size.   Overall I will always return for the muffins, and service. Highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Fast service and delicious food every time. My go to breakfast joint. I have yet to be disappointed ordering anything from here. Even the Sunday rush is worth enduring."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Dudes....this place has a wide menu that really kicks. We collectively had an omelette/skillet; delicious and fresh. Fruit platter and whoa, what a variety!!! Also fresh! Personally I had the specialty, the Gumbolaya; holy crap! Sooo delicious and flavorful. Even a couple of employees came up to me to compliment how much they personally loved that dish themselves and were excited of my choice! Whaaaaaat???! Definitely go here...bring your relatives in town visiting and treat them to this house of deliciousness."}
{"text":"This place is amazing they have enormous portions even I couldn't finish it the first time. Love coming for breakfast here."}
{"text":"If I could give this place more than five stars I would. The first time I came here I sat at the counter and asked my server, Kelli, for some unsweet tea and the sausage gray biscuits (which were fantastic). On my second trip, five weeks later, I again sat at the counter. Kelli walks up and says \"Unsweet tea again?\". When I replied \"Yes\" she asks, \"You want to try something new or go with the sausage gravy and biscuits again?\". That is absolutely crazy that she could remember an order from a single customer five weeks later, especially after only one visit. Since then I've been going with my girlfriend, so we sit at a table. Our waitress has always been Randi and she is absolutely amazing. Do yourself a favor and ask for her by name.       As for the food, outside of the Cincy chilli, everything I've had has been outstanding. Fresh, hot and large portions; what's not to love. To me, the food at Egg Works is pretty much the gold standard by which other breakfast places are measured. In terms of service, Egg Works is the gold standard by which ALL places are measured."}
{"text":"Good food, prices are pretty fair, excellent customer service. Nice experience my daughter and I had. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have only been here once but the time i was there was amazing. The food was really great and the staff was very friendly. I went at about 1pm on a sunday so there was a grip of people coming from church, yet it wasnt very packed at all"}
{"text":"We came here with my family that reside in Vegas. They told us this was one of the best breakfast/brunch places near their home. We arrived at about 1pm and had to wait about 15 minutes until we sat down. That there was a good sign of good food. When people travel to Vegas all they think about is the chain restaurants and the buffets. Well since we stayed in Summerlin this was quite a treat. Unfortunately we sat at a section where the server was not attentive. She was quite slow and didn't check up on us. Hence the reason I gave 4 stars. I don't remember her name as I doubt she even gave us her name. She looked distraught as soon as she came to take our order. The greeter was nice enough to grab our drinks but then waited a good 25 minutes for the server to pop in and ask if we where ready. Aside from the minimal problems with the server. Food was exceptionally delicious. We all ordered an omelet as they make them fresh and use four large organic eggs. I had the Sundance special. It had spinach mushroom and artichokes. Plus lots of feta cheese. It was delicious. Their banana nut bread is to die for. Amazing. Anyways next time in town I'll definitely hit this place up for our breakfast needs."}
{"text":"Grandparents were in town and wanted brunch, so to Egg Works we went and we definitely left full and satisfied! Highly recommended for quick service and empty tummy's!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for an early morning breakfast (after a late and heavy dinner) and the place was surprisingly sparse. There were a few regulars there but the number of empty seats outnumbered us 10 to 1.  Had the sausage omelette and with endless coffee. Pretty good! The omelette came with melted cheese on top of it and the coffee was okay! I wish I wasn't so stuffed still from dinner - maybe I would have been able to fit all of the potatoes and maybe even a muffin."}
{"text":"Egg works has been my favorite breakfast place since I've been in Vegas! I recently went to this one on rainbow and the waitress was the best, all the employees were phenomenal even down to the bussers! Now you're probably wondering why I'm giving this location a 1, well it's because the manager was a complete ASSHOLE. He was treating all the employees like they were pieces of shit. I caught his name and just in case y'all go here, make sure you don't have an encounter with BRUCE because he will ruin your experience at this wonderful breakfast place."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was great! The Banna Muffin is off the hook.  I next time we are in town this our go to place for breakfast."}
{"text":"The service was top notch! Matt did a great job serving us. My son devoured the banana nut muffin in seconds. Super moist, super delicious. The potatoes were crispy and full of flavor. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Delish!!!!    I love the little egg cards to signal staff when you need things verses the rude person who shouts out at the staff!!!!  Brilliant idea!  Food was fast & hot!  I am talking about hot from the stove and not a heat lamp!  It was birthday, and the staff presented a muffin full of whipped cream!  It was definitely a wow factor!   Great place to bring your staff for a little team building and  good food!"}
{"text":"Love this little place!  It's always busy, food portions are huge, staff are friendly, and my server checks up on me!  There is a placard shaped like an egg, on the table that is to be used if you have a need.  Great idea for visual cues for staff.    Please go here!  Eat the huge banana muffin, read the paper and enjoy a cup of joe!"}
{"text":"Lisa T gave amazing service!! She was genuine and helpful. The staff creates a happy environment to enjoy a Saturday brunch :) egg works is my go to summerlin breakfast spot! My omelet are always egg-celent! I hope they serve gluten free bread in the future:)"}
{"text":"Service was great. Candice was extremely friendly and helpful to our needs! Good was excellent."}
{"text":"So I literally just left this Flamingo location in a bad mood. As my boyfriend & I walk in, were warmly welcomed with the nice hostesses. She seats us at a table that still has tip money from the last customers & no table set up.   I believe we had no particular server because the busser ends up taking our drink order after seeing us not being taken care of yet. Few moments later, a server asks us for our drinks orders again. Then after that, a separate server asks to take our food order.   Many minutes later, no banana muffin or food has been delivered. I ask for vanilla creamer which I never received. They must not have food runners either because my boyfriend can see his food sitting in the window.   In a rush, 45 minutes later, I ask for take out boxes when I finally get my waffles. They gave me runny eggs when I specifically said over-medium.   After my boyfriend boxes up our food he finds a hair on his plate. It couldn't have been his because his head is shaved.   Towards the end, I asked if we could have lids to take out syrup home for my waffles. I never received them.  When I asked if we get banana muffins with our meal, the server said \"only if it comes with the order or if its your first time.\" Now how would they know if it was our first time or not if no one asked us in the beginning? As a server myself for a different restaurant, I know asking the customer if it is their first time is one of the first things you ask when you greet them.   I gave Eggworks 2 stars this time and not 1 because I still do enjoy their food. They're always busy so they should be used to the fast paced environment. We were easy customers who knew what to order immediately, did not complain verbally, & STILL tipped them. As an Egg Works fan, I'm really disappointed and hope they can improve their service, cleanliness and communication."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place for breakfast in town since I moved to Vegas. And I've only been here once. Great environment, great staff, Brandi was just amazing and very kind and caring, and the food was just delicious. I had the chicken and spinach egg skillet and I will be back."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but more on the strong side. One of the really salty ones was the country benny. I do admit, that I ate the biscuit n' gravy separate from the egg, so that tipped the flavor way onto the salty lands. You have to eat it altogether.  Their banana bread is famous for a reason, and it's only understandable if you try it."}
{"text":"Stopped here famished and tired for the first time around 2 in the afternoon after a shopping marathon on a Saturday...place was packed and we were HUNGRY!  I ran in ahead of my wife to secure a seat (no problem)...she engaged with the guests seated outside with a gaze of amazement at the delectable looking egg dished being served.    The variety and selection of breakfast dishes is extensive and printed on a Sunday New York Times sized menu.  My wife selected the chicken fried steak skillet...it was yummy and came with skillet potatoes, sliced chicken fried steak, your choice of eggs, and a delicious pork white gravy.    I opted for the blackened Prime Rib Skillet, which came with skillet potatoes, poached eggs, spinach on a croissant (I substituted english muffins), and smothered with hollandaise sauce.  I was however,  very disappointed with the prime rib as the meat was dried up and the size of bacon bits...certainly not like the slices of prime rib that I had envisioned.  Service was prompt however and I think we will be back to try other selections (I mean they had sooooo many breakfast selections that I am sure there are ones to please us both).  I may have to try the stuffed chili relleno, or the stuffed french toast next time.    All in all...huge selection, prompt service and a great place to go when you are hungry for a HUGE breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot in Henderson. PK was our server today and he's great! 5-Star service, food, and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is always slammed which is fine if they had a hostess in place or one that knows what she's doing. I've been there several times and it seems like a server is always trying to help the hostess figure out a confusing. We waited 20 mins longer than she quoted us. Another thing I don't like is there is literally not one thing on the menu that isn't full of fat and calories other than the oatmeal I think. Most restaurants give a heathy option area or at least 2-3 choices of a lower calorie meal. We won't go back again for that reason. But don't worry about my review a lot of people love this place and like I said it's always packed"}
{"text":"I've never tried any of the other egg places.  Being a native to the southwest side, this place has always been on the top of my list.  From the yummy muffin to the zesty potatoes, everything is always cooked to perfection.  If we don't have time to dine in, they are always more than willing to take a pickup order over the phone."}
{"text":"Much to my surprise, the food was great and the portions large. The cheese was melted on top of my omelet, a different touch. The rye toast was excellent marbled rye. Service was fast and friendly. A good choice for breakfast in Vegas"}
{"text":"Great service! Decent prices.   I am a huge fan of all the different omelets. From the Denver to the garlic mashed potato omelette, you just can't go wrong. I am, however, not a fan of the waffles or pancakes.   Truly worth a try..."}
{"text":"Stop by this location, and food was good. Banana bread was so moist, definitely recommend. Portions were also a good size, couldn't finish all my food. Staff was friendly"}
{"text":"Super good family restaurant. The breakfast burrito was on point. I will be back when I mosey my way back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. I really hate to give 1 star. You know how BAD you have to be to get 1 star!! I don't throw 1 stars around at all. Let me explain. I SPECIFICALLY asked the waitress about the VEGGIE burger. I am a vegetarian. She told me if was really good, lots of customers order it. So, I did too. It comes to me and I take a bite and I start getting worried. The end is PINK, and I've NEVER EVER had a veggie burger PINK before. I am staring at it and I see red and green specks, so I ASSUME it's red and green peppers. I take another SMALL bite. It tastes like meat. I call waitress over and ask, is this the veggie burger?? She says yes. I said, I've never ever had a veggie burger that tasted so much like meat. She once again tells me, yes, it's a veggie burger. I am STARING at it. I can't eat it. Something is wrong and I know it. About 2 seconds later the manager comes over and says \"I'm sorry. We made a mistake. That is a TURKEY burger. The waitress got confused. Lots of people order veggie burgers but they mean turkey burgers\". I almost PUKED. I haven't eaten chicken or poultry in TWELVE years!!! It makes me SICK TO MY STOMACH. I would have rather them give me beef than turkey. The manager comped the whole meal and gave me a 50% off coupon to come back. YEAH FREAKIN RIGHT! They are lucky I dont sue them. I am NOT kidding when I say I suffered mental anguish. The thought of turkey in my mouth made me vomit. I puked several times that night. I went home and was SICK TO MY STOMACH. LITERALLY. It was the attic and the basement (I hope you know what I mean). This was truly traumatizing. I still shudder when I think about it. I will NEVER EVER recommend them. I have been told to sue them, and believe me I'VE CONSIDERED it. I was mouth r*ped by a turkey burger. (Sorry to be so graphic.) But it's true and how I feel. Please stay away from here. NEVER EVER go. It's a BAAAAAD BAAAAAD place."}
{"text":"The \"Loco Moco\" is a game changer! Absolutely fantastic! Medium on the burger, over-easy eggs, and it's always done to perfection. Thanks to Monica for the bread today, my whole family is going to destroy it tomorrow morning!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch place. Big portions with great flavor. Honestly my favorite part is the complimentary banana muffins they give to first timers. They come out warm and if you put some butter on it it'll be heaven! Great environment as well."}
{"text":"I tried the new pork carnitas burrito today, it was good but it seemed like it was needing something to make it a perfect dish...... Candice was my server and she was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious, I had the prime rib bennidict and it was to die for... Their potatoes that the have patented are perfectly seasoned... Above that the service was some of the best I've ever had... Frank was our server and I've never had such an attentive caring waiter. A+ and 5 stars on everything!"}
{"text":"Today was  my second time coming in. Amanda was our waitress although it was a bit busy she took well care of our party of four. This place is delicious. Big variety."}
{"text":"So glad we decided to get breakfast here instead of at the casino. Great hangover breakfast at a great price. I got the breakfast burrito, which is smothered in an enchilada like sauce, and it was fantastic. It comes served with their famous potatoes, which also hit the spot.  The coffee and the service were also great. The only negative is that the lines can be long so it can be a brutal 40 minute wait in the Vegas sun, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and it was a disappointing visit. I got an order of the coconut french toast (I'm a sucker for anything with coconut). My wife got the regular french toast breakfast and our son got a kid's chocolate chip pancake shaped like Mickey Mouse. Both orders of french toast were less than stellar -- thin slices of bread that were over-cooked. I was hoping they would use bread that would make their french toast more unique and flavorful, but no. Just some boring flat slices. Personally, I think I can make better french toast. My son did enjoy his pancake and the sausage that it came with was very good. Reading other Yelp reviews, it sounds like most people get some banana nut muffins with their entree. We didn't get any. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. Maybe I should have gotten one of the skillet dishes. I don't know. But, based on this one experience I'd rather eat breakfast at the Cracked Egg or Black Bear Diner."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since the nearby IHOP is terrible and I'm not a fan of the name changing, yet same menu at GriddleCakes (supposed to be ran together I didn't goof!). Too bad I wasn't so thrilled about this place either, but it for sure is better than the 2 breakfast spots I previously mentioned. I came in on a Sunday so naturally it was packed inside. I was with a yelper friend and we were still seated right away even though they were busy. There is a fair amount of tables and tables with half booths inside, but the table we were sat at shouldn't be there. I was practically sitting in the kitchen! Menus were brought to us right away and our server was nice. I just didn't like waiting f-o-r-e-v-e-r to get some cream for my coffee. I asked our server for it and she said she'd be right back. I watched her (since the machine they use to enter orders and the kitchen was right near me) enter in orders and tend other tables including the one customer crazy enough to eat out on the patio on such a hot day, but still I had no cream for my coffee. They have this thing on the table where if you are in need of something you can flip this \"egg\" to black when you are doing fine and flip it to yellow if you need something. The yelper I was with flipped the egg to yellow and someone quickly came over and got me some cream. I had already enjoyed 2 cups of coffee before I finally scored some. I thought the cup of coffee was steep being priced at $2.75, but damn that was good coffee! The coffee was the best thing I had during my meal. I like that they bring a carafe to your table so you can keep refilling your cup at your own leisure. Most of my rating goes to the coffee!   Priced at $10.75 I ordered a \"Bacon & Sliced Avocado Omelette\" that came with a side of \"Works Potatoes\" and a \"Banana Nut Muffin\" that I have heard many good things about. The muffin came out first and it was hot, fresh and moist, but where was the banana flavor? I tasted no banana. It just tasted like a warm muffin with a hint of sweetness. Nothing special. The works potatoes were good and seasoned nicely, but they tasted exactly like fries. I prefer more of a hash brown type of potato with my breakfast personally not fries. The omelette was just okay. I can't believe I'm about to say this, but there was actually too much bacon in it! Yes, I just said that! It was just too much bacon and not enough egg. The amount of cheese and avocado (it had huge chunks of ripe and delicious avocado!) was very fair. The omelette just wasn't fluffy enough though and when you have grown up eating them at the Omelette House on W Charleston like I have, you know what a perfect, good omelette is supposed to taste like and I just didn't find it here. The coffee being so good, I just might someday come back and give their french toast a try, but with my single breakfast totaling $13.50 before tax and tip and not being fully satisfied with it, I can't see coming back often or anytime soon."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. I went to the the location on eastern Ave. It was perfect. I had the veggie skillet with their famous banana muffin and my server Ethan was kind enough to tell me there was a smaller size available. I was in shock how big the small size was. I always have to add something to my food to suit my taste. Not here though both were deliciously perfect. I asked who the chef was today, since that usually makes all the difference. It was the assistant manager Aaron or Eric. I'll be calling ahead to see when he is working. The atmosphere was pleasant with a unique theme. The coffee was delicious. Because  I rarely find black coffee the way I like it, I stopped ordering out. Today I took a chance and ordered a cup. Great veggie skillet eggs, yummy banana muffin, coffee, atmosphere and service! I would not have changed a thing. Perfect!"}
{"text":"First brunch place my boyfriend & I went to since we've moved here to vegas from California. We loved it! Very friendly staff & good food. Well, our waitress was a little too handsy with my boyfriend but it made me laugh at least. Nice atmosphere too. We'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"This is a classic Vegas breakfast stop. The service is wonderfully fast and friendly. Smiles all around. The fruit is the best I have seen as a side dish. Huge pieces of perfectly ripe fruit! I had to take my extras with me. The Eggs Benedict had thick pieces of ham, oozing eggs and a crisp muffin.  We ordered a custom omelette. They are happy to give you exactly what you want. The cheese was generous and soooo melty ( is that a word?). The edges were crisp and buttery. As decadent as it was, it wasn't heavy or greasy.   Definitely a stop you will be happy with!"}
{"text":"They don't do amex! No good for business travelers. They let three of us walk out the door. Not a great business decision. Ended up at the BLACK BEAR which was awesome!"}
{"text":"Rosie was our server today and she was so nice and helpful. I had the special, the carnitas skillet and it was a perfect combo of cheese, meat, eggs and potatoes. My daughter got her regular, the Mickey pancake. I've never had a bad experience here! Service is always stellar and food is on point!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good here. They got those menus that are made of newspaper.    The food is so consistent that if you went in every single morning and ordered the exact same thing, you might start to feel like you were trapped in a Groundhog's Day type of reality loop.  Eat here. It's 4 stars. Don't be scared. It's good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local breakfast place! I have been to Egg Works several times now and they never fail to impress me. They get an A+ in all respects - atmosphere, price, service, and of course, food.  The restaurant is easy to access and find. It is near Rainbow and 215 across from Arroyo Crossing Shopping Center. The restaurant is a good size and we've never had to wait too long even on a Sunday morning. A huge plus in my book is they are very kid friendly! They provided a car seat sling at our table, and we didn't even have to request it.  Service has been consistent every time. We've had different servers and all of them have been friendly and efficient. When I order coffee, they leave a coffee pot at the table so I don't have to wait for refills. Their coffee is always fresh and tastes so good. I like they provide different flavors of creamer too.  I'm not a banana fan but I love, love, love their Banana Nut Muffin! It is so moist and the banana taste is not overpowering. I have tried several items on their menu and have been happy with my order most of the time. The last time I ordered the Prime Rib Benedict and the hollandaise had way too much lemon. My husband ordered the Country Fried Steak Skillet and that was to die for! Their potatoes are seasoned very well. Their serving portions are generous.  Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, and the fact that Egg Works gets five stars in my book, is not to be taken lightly."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! The only thing is, we were sat at a table. & for three different items I had to get up and take from the table beside me. The ketchup was empty, no creamer for my coffee, and no strawberry jelly. My server was really nice and sweet and helpful though!"}
{"text":"Brought our family and friends from out of town. Mario, our waiter, was very friendly, helpful, and fun. Made our experience fantastic, and the food was outstanding, as always! Great food, great times. Can't ask for better."}
{"text":"Best banana nut muffin ever.   Service was friendly and welcoming like I was part of the family.   Food was hot fresh and tasty!!   Pricing is fair with good portion size"}
{"text":"This place is great. It gets swamped on weekends- if you come before 1PM, be prepared to wait to be seated at least 10 minutes, possibly longer for larger parties.  It is worth it, though. My fiancé swears by their biscuits & gravy, I really like their \"Hawaiian\" breakfasts- the sticky rice, brown gravy & spam is delish! I've also had their mashed potato omelet (pretty good, huge portion) and a few of their Benedicts (homemade Hollandaise is great) and have been pleased. Also, their coffee is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places.    Service is always quick for a place that's always packed.   Other places should take serious note.  Our server Rossy was da bomb diggity.   Knew us by name soon as we sat down. So personal and funny. Got me to try the daily special and I'm glad I did.   Bad part was I ate it so fast there's no pic.  Groupon deals make this more than affordable.   Coupons are also all over Vegas.  You better get some of this food.  I'm from the east coast.  Where we love some cracker barrel.   This is about the next best thing to that without all the dang granny crap cracker wants you to buy."}
{"text":"If you're into ginormous breakfasts, Eggworks is the place to go to. On first glance, the prices for the items on the menu may seem a little high, considering how the main ingredient of most dishes are eggs, but the portion sizes here are big enough for me to stay full until dinner time. That is well worth the money.   The service was flawless. Each table has an egg sign that customers can flip over to be smiling contently or frowning in need of service, making for efficient communication between the customers and the servers.   Another thing I appreciate in this place is how casually welcoming the atmosphere is. As someone who positively despises having to wake up early to get ready, I love how this is one of the places I can walk into wearing sweats and a t-shirt without being judged.  I ordered the Chicken Enchilada Omelet, which comes with potatoes and either a banana nut muffin or a piece of toast. The muffin came out almost immediately after I placed the order. Although it wasn't warm anymore, it was still fluffy and delicious, which is all that counts. The tables are stocked with anything that one could need for breakfast: jam, ketchup, sugar, salt, and pepper packets are all readily available. My omelet did not take longer than ten minutes to arrive and was the most fulfilling breakfast I have had in a while. There was plenty of chicken in the omelet, and the sour cream added a nice touch to it.  Customers pay the bill right at the cash register, where a friendly cashier quickly cashes them out and wishes them a nice day. Definitely an egg-celent place to start the day out with!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat breakfast at in Las Vegas. The food is amazing, the service is great and the coffee is spectacular. I almost go once a week I love it so much, either Saturday or Sunday mornings. Even though the place gets really packed they'll accommodate you fast, you will usually wait 15 mins tops if is that busy.  Their omelets are delicious and they have variety so I guaranty you will find something you like. Oh! and don't forget to order a banana muffin with your coffee ;)"}
{"text":"Really impressed with the service and selection. They have a system where you turn an egg on the top of the table to notify the staff if you need help!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely disgusting I just moved from Cali to Vegas so I'm new around here. Came to have some breakfast with my mother and there was a worm swimming in my egg!!!! I was disgusted not only that the potato's were extremely over cooked and over seasoned! Will never come back here again."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! I love getting away from the tourist traps and finding local places to eat. I had the blackened prime rib Benny and it was amazing! Our server Ashley was very helpful and even brought us a banana nut muffin on the house."}
{"text":"Starting our way home from 2 lovely nights at Red Rock Casino we needed a breakfast to get us going. Tired of Casino smoke and food we found this delightful spot. The menu was full of selections but the 4 egg omelet would be huge. Our server then told us we could do a half order for a discounted charge. I had a half order of eggs Benedict, he had a 2 egg omelet with bacon, avocado and cheese. Great potatoes and a side of fruit. Service was fast, first time visitors get a free muffin. Next time we visit, it will be back on our list to go again! Server was wonderful too."}
{"text":"I had the prime rib Eggs Benedict and would highly recommend it. The hollandaise sauce was done very well and I liked the use of a croissant instead of an English muffin. My friend had the chorizo corn beef hash and he was not so pleased and felt it was rather bland. The bloody Mary's were not so great either. Very plain. I gave four stars because the eggs Benedict was so good."}
{"text":"Our last stop in this place we had very sloppy server he didn't give good customer service.. We stopped in again and had Cassandra as our server she is excellent great customer service.. I asked her for light seasoning on my potatoes and she understood that it sometimes they are too salty both plates we ordered came with light seasoned potatoes and great presentation. she came to our table to check on us often and did not have to wait so long for beverages or food. Some serves hand you the check after you take your first bite and ruins your food but she knew exactly when to drop it We didn't feel rushed."}
{"text":"This was my first time here at egg works I got the sunrise omelet and my fiancé got the Green chili hash it was absolutely wonderful food was good and it wasn't as busy as normal our waitress Melinda was very pleasant and attentive to our needs our new favorite spot for sure!!"}
{"text":"Really good food in the breakfast-y type realm.  Service is quick and friendly, especially at the counter, and the only hang up is when there is a line to pay on the way out.  I love that they give you a carafe when you order coffee so that you can refill on your time.  I honestly can't think of anything more to say except that I've been here twice now and will be back again."}
{"text":"As a former employee of this place, I'm slightly bias......SLIGHTLY!  ~The food is consistently cooked the same way, YUM!  You can go to any of the three locations, order the same thing, and it will ALWAYS taste the same.  Good deal!  ~PUMPKIN PANCAKES..........are delicious!   ~Banana nut french  toast.......what?!?!?!?  ~The staff is fantastic and always willing to help me modify (egg whites, light cheese, easy seasoning) as I so desire.   ~Bloody Marys and mimosas in the a.m..........yes please!   *It is a DO recommend for breakfast, brunch, or lunch in my book!"}
{"text":"Soooo good, soooo fulfilling and the banana nut muffins are to die for. Oh and their Santa Cruz sauce will make you want to put it on everything...The service is fast and friendly too..."}
{"text":"I give the Egg Works Restaurant a 5 star rating. I took my 91 year old mother there for a late Sunday brunch. I was greeted by the manager who went out of her way to make sure our seating was comfortable and near. Our waitress Hannah stopped by our table about ten times, so did the manager, making sure we had plenty of time to order and then making sure we were happy with our selections. The veggie omelette, which contained spinach, artichokes and mushrooms and topped with Feta Cheese and tomatoes, was really flavorful. I'm dieting, but it didn't taste like it. My mom ordered the Chicken Fried Steak. The gravy was from scratch or so it seemed. When you ask for a fruit substitution you get a great variety of sliced fruit. The presentation was lovely. I'll be back soon and will recommend this place to friends. Thank you for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Awesome...the carnitas burrito is screaming good. The decor is kinda country, garnish. But man oh man what delicious grub they have. Thus is my 2nd visit in 3 months...and I love in Los Angeles. Every Las Vegas needs to include a visit here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Always a great place to meet up for breakfast. Service is always consistent and food is on spot."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. The food was amazing. My fiance and I had biscuits and gravy ! So yummy ! The mimosa was so good ! They give you your own mini bottle of champagne and oj , you can put as much (or little ) of oj as you like ! Hubby really loved the sausages ! Manny was our server and he was amazing. So friendly and helpful. We just moved here from Reno, he has been the most friendly encounter since we've arrived ! Egg works is our new breakfast spot !"}
{"text":"The true test of a great restaurant is consistency in it's service. I have breakfast on a regular basis at EggWorks on S. Rainbow and each time my waitress Veronica more than exceeds my expectations!  Great staff!  Great service!! Great food!!!"}
{"text":"I really like Egg Works! The muffins, the Loco Moco, corn beef hash, hash browns and pancakes are all amazing! The service is typically shitty, but its do-able!"}
{"text":"There is nothing like their banana nut muffins and their hablo diablo potatoes. By far the best brunch and for a reasonable price too. On top of the amazing food is the amazing service; very nice and very friendly staff. My friend and I are literally here every week, it's definitely the favorite breakfast spot.   You go Taylor!"}
{"text":"Been at this location 3 times and had Robert as my server. He provides great service and recommendations. Would love to be seated as his tables every time I come here."}
{"text":"My family is here just about weekly. We love coming here. Everyone leaves full and happy. Every once in a while they grace the world with a Groupon which helps out egg and coffee fix."}
{"text":"I'm sad to leave this review with such low stars. After reading the reviews I was pumped to eat there, but after my food came I was not so excited. My $7 fruit plate was old and yucky. The grapefruit and blueberries were all shriveled up. I had to send it all back. If your going to charge $7 for fruit at least have it be fresh please. The potato hash browns were pretty good. And the staff is super friendly so that's why I gave 3 stars instead of 1 or 2."}
{"text":"Place is always busy but they get you seated and served quickly.  Out server Mariia was very nice and attentive(hope you win the trip to Disneyland!)."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was great except she forgot to bring my half and half. Very large portions.   This is a popular place based on the volume of guests there.  Unfortunately, I went to the restroom and a female employee used the facilities but did not wash her hands. Cane out of the stall and went right out the door"}
{"text":"This place was incredible and FAR exceeded my expectations. My family was driving through town on our way back to Phoenix. We originally were going to go to another breakfast place but the wait was over an hour long. Starving and very irritable, we found this on Yelp and our party of 5 walked right in. Our server, Donna, was awesome and way on the ball, with a great attitude. She took our drink order immediately and came back with them before we even got settled in. I blinked and our food was there. I don't even know how they got it there so fast. Plus, it was DELICIOUS!   Slow clap for a job well done. We'll definitely come back here next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Wow, this was the salty food and I'm okay with salt, but this was a salt over load.  Service was ok, but had terrible interaction with young server in bathroom.  It's convenient location and quick service but food could be improved."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast after training at 24.  What I like about Egg Works is the food and service is always consistent.  Servers always check on you, never have to request refills, etc.   They never seem to mind menu request modifications if you are trying to keep it healthy.  I also appreciate a dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"The banana nut muffins are worth the trip alone.  I had the chocolate chip pancakes and they were great. Overall, nice atmosphere, friendly service, and great food with generous portions.  Will definitely go back to try some other pancake combinations."}
{"text":"So darn good! We happened to find this spot after a soccer tournament near by. Next time I end up in Vegas I will intentionally make it a point to come in for some more.   I ordered the veggie benny and... WOW! The hollandaise sauce was delicious the egg was perfectly cooked the whole thing was just absolutely phenomenal. The portion size was huge! The potatoes are absolutely delicious as well. I like the metal card things that they have that can be flipped over if you require service. We didn't need to use them since our server was attentive. The kid had the stuffed french toast an d though it was \"so good\".  The one downfall,  I never really care for the whole line up at the end of your meal to pay. Especially in a place like this that has a lot of people, because you end up waiting in line for a while just to pay your tab.   As I said, next time I visit Vegas, I'm taking the 20 minute trip just to eat breakfast here."}
{"text":"Amazing variety on the menu and one of the best places to grab breakfast. We love it here. My favorite is the vegetarian crepe. Delicious! The burritos are good and their Diablo potatoes are amazing!"}
{"text":"First time dining at this location and our server ASHLEY was amazing .She was attentive and very friendly .Ashley deserves to win a trip to Disney ,she made this dining experience a happy one.Thanks Ashley for making me a happy customer."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place and conveniently located near home!  I love breakfast food, hate mornings, so I always end up enjoying it at night. Today was different since I actually woke up early enough on my day off to enjoy some eggs and coffee!!! My beau and I ordered:   - spinach Benny  - corned beef hash - coffee  - banana nut muffin  The spinach Benny is two poached eggs on top of Canadian bacon, spinach, and old English muffins covered in hollandaise sauce with a side of country potatoes. This was super tasty and the hollandaise was perfect and not too salty. The country potatoes were also deliciously golden crispy and perfectly seasoned. Mmm... Corned beef hash was served with a side of potatoes as well, but my beau ordered a side of rice to mix the hash with. It makes a great combo. The hash was good, I just wish there was more meat!!!  The banana nut muffins are always popular here, so it's no exception for me!! They're always nicely warm and sweet and perfect when you spread some butter on it. Gives it a nice balance of sweet and salty!! Pairs well with their coffee, and it's actually really good coffee.   This will always be my favorite breakfast spot and it's reasonably priced too. Portions are generous (although I always finish my plate) and the staff is always friendly and attentive! I'll definitely wake up early for this place...  Well, let's see how comfy my bed is that day... :)"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by a local and we couldn't be any more happy with his recommendation. The atmosphere was very \"mom and pops\" type of restaurant. My husband and I both ordered the Sunrise Mountain, which is a croissant topped with scrambled  eggs, your choice of meat (we had bacon and ham) and a ton of melted cheese! We also ordered a stack of pancakes, which are huge! Neither my husband nor I were able to finish our meals and had plenty to take home. A great place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Came for a breakfast meeting and was not disappointed.  Eggs are well prepared, as you might expect from the name.  They have a decent sized menu, and seem to do all of the favorites and standards.  Coffee was good and robust--a must for a business meeting.  Prices were fairly decent, too, especially for Summerlin.  The restaurant itself is a bit cavernous and not cozy, so more for a big group of your friends and family than an intimate dining experience with your better half."}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least 15 times. My only complaint ---not enough space!  Aside from that...they serve everything you need to get your day stated off right. Waffles are solid, not too dense, love the veggie Benedict and breakfast burrito is awesome. Oh and endless coffee, how can you complain???! I've never been disappointed. Must go."}
{"text":"This place never fails to satisfy. Portions are big and reasonably priced. We come to Vegas from San Diego and always stop in at least once. Throw in a groupon deal and it only gets better. Checked in on Yelp and got a free banana muffin. Will definitely stop on our next trip again."}
{"text":"Bring a non-service dog to a restaurant, and wonder why they almost brawl when one walks by another? WTF/Why? Are you frumptards so lonely that you have to bring a fricken dog to a restaurant? And the restaurant allows it. IDIOTS! Wont be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Unimpressed with the lack of Low-Carb options. No possibility of substituting extra egg(s) or a meat option for the Potatoes, Toast/Muffin. Considering the low food-cosy associated with each, it shouldnt be a problem.  Add Low-Carb iyems to the menu, offer Low-Carb Substitution possibilitied and market the venue as one of the only Low-Carb Restaurants in Henderson and watch the sales increase exponentially."}
{"text":"Banana. Nut. Muffin. Freshly baked, so soft and moist it slices like cake! You must be thinking, why in the world did I eat my muffin with a fork and knife? Well, I saw my friend's grandma do the same and wanted to keep up my etiquette ;-) check in on Yelp to get one free! And most breakfast plates come with the option if you don't want ordinary toast. Not hating on toast-- I love me some rye swirl so warm it melts butter! And a dab of raspberry jam if it's wheat.  Overwhelming newspaper menu similar to Black Bear Diner. Cute. So many options! I noticed a trend with some fillings, just a different type of food. I got \"the Works\" skillet breakfast which is ham, bacon, sausage, mushroom, onion, diced tomato, green bell peppers, cheddar, 2 eggs all over Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. You can order the Works for just about anything, including omelets, scramble, etc. Cheesy goodness! My over medium eggs looked great and burst at the yoke with a single poke, oozing all over the squared potatoes down below. I'll admit my dish was a tad bit saltier than my preference, but it's probably from the seasoning.  The friend (the birthday girl!) and her family ordered waffles, corn beef hash, veggie crepes that look like omelets upon first glance, omelets and banana nut muffins all around, with an order of toast. Large portions, lower prices! Apparently there's a Groupon deal right now and that's how my friend's dad discovered this place.  There's something for everyone! Pancakes, waffles, French toast, omelets, scrambles, crepes, hashes, etc. I also saw mimosas on the menu for the early drinkers.   Sunday morning was busy but we snagged a 6 seater. Friendly, comfortable, homey environment! Staff is so nice! Troy took drink orders, poured coffee for everyone, and even asked if I'd like whipped cream on my hot chocolate or not. Maybe lots of folks would rather skip the calories? We're in Vegas! Back to the gym next week ... Drea was a delight! She took our orders and made us feel so welcome. We asked for recommendations and she said everything is good! I shall return. And will order half a dozen banana nut muffins to go =)"}
{"text":"Our server was great! We've never been here before so my boyfriend asked for her suggestion. So we got the Chile Rellenos omelette and Chicken Enchilada omelette. We also had the banana nut muffin, which didn't look like much but don't be fooled, tasted amazing. The portions were big, we left happy and satisfied, only mad we didn't find it sooner."}
{"text":"I've come to the conclusion that there are two types of ratings here on Yelp...the Standard star rating, and the Suburban star rating.  The average Suburban star rating appears to generally be a star higher than it would be with the Standard star rating because the restaurant is in a suburban setting amongst all the other ho-hum chain restaurants.  I think that's the case for this place, the food was OK but not 4 1/2 stars worth.  I had the pork chop breakfast and Mark H had the New York strip breakfast.  Both were ok with the steak being the better of the two...seasoned nicely and was cooked to mid-rare as ordered.  My pork chops on the other hand were cut so thin (about 1/4\") that there was no way that they'd be anything but dry.  They were seasoned OK, but just so darn dry.  The other disappointment were the potatoes that came with Mark H's steak and eggs.  They were also quite dry like they had been sitting under the heat lamp for a long time.  The best part of the breakfast was that you could get a house-made banana nut muffin instead of toast.  The muffin was tasty and really moist.  If you check in on Yelp, you also get a free banana nut muffin so we got the free one to go.  The service was friendly and attentive so that's also another thing Egg Works has going for it.  Don't get me wrong, this place is OK and compared to the numerous chain places in Summerlin it's better but I'm just not sure it's worth 4 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"My husband, sister and I decided to try this place while we were in town for the holidays, and I was pleasantly surprised. I got the country fried chicken skillet and it was so delicious.  I was disappointed that I had to ask for cream and when I \"flipped the egg\" it did take several minutes for anyone to come by. With that said, the place was packed and our waitress, Jennifer, had really a lot of big tables.  Overall, it a yummy stop. I think it was a little overpriced, but the food was good and the service was not horrible.  If you're looking for a good place for kids, or a nice place to meet the family for brunch or something, this might be just the ticket."}
{"text":"Tasty food, excellent customer service, friendly and inviting atmosphere. Have been coming here for breakfast since I moved here several years ago, and family and friends I know have come for longer. The breakfast  food is always tasty, the muffins are sooo good. The ingredients are not extravagant, but consistently very good, very well flavored. Portions are large and we almost always have to take some to go.  The staff is always friendly, upbeat and engaging, the decorations are nice. If there are ever any concerns with an order, as can happen in a place occasionally, they are prompt to address. Sometimes there is a wait on weekends, but they keep it clean and get you in pretty quickly. Whether there is a crowd or fewer patrons, the service, quality of food, and experience is consistently great.  I also like other restuarants that have a bit more variety in terms of vegetables added and creative twists on breakfast items, so they are not my preferred 5 star, however solid 4 star for me and plus my husband loves them and I love going there with him."}
{"text":"My only breakfast house. Best in Las Vegas always a friendly staff and the food is amazing!!!! Have to get works crepe or enchilada omelette."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get breakfast in the valley. Fast and friendly service. Not to mention the food is delicious."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. All plates came with more than enough food. Prices are reasonable. We were a group of 5 adults who came in at 9am on a Friday and all of out food came out in a timely fashion. The place is REALLY clean so I was super happy about that. The decor is great. Music is playing at the perfect volume in the restaurant (for easy chatting) and in the bathroom (for self conscious peoples)."}
{"text":"Not good breakfast, everything is too salty. They messed up our order and took it to different table, forgot few other things we requested. Not good breakfast meaning it's typical normal breakfast you can make better breakfast at home with less oil. I would have given 1 start but because our serve at least had a good attitude. Never going back"}
{"text":"Nice place, attentive staff, wonderful food. Simple and smart, like breakfast should be"}
{"text":"My Favorite place to eat for breakfast, hands down.  Great service.  For some reason, even their tap water tastes really good.  Sunrise mountain is my favorite."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great breakfast spot in town. This is a great place to bring the whole family. It's very family oriented and they do have a kids menu. Friendly service always. The coffee is very very good. The food is quality. You can order half size when ordering. They also have a breakfast station that you can sit at that is set up like a bar style. So if you come alone it's perfect. They don't accept American Express. I'm a regular here. PK is a wonderful server!!"}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday morning about 930, so a 20 minute wait was expected. It took another 40 minutes to get the food. However, the omelette was delicious, and massive. I'm glad me and my wife decided to slit the order. Don't know if the hour wait was worth it, but the food was delicious and the service was top notch. I'd recommend going at a not so busy time. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy to my tummy, this is the second time I've been to this restaurant different location of course. This is the first time I tried banana nut muffin it very good, lots of food in your plate. I will be back next time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Had breakfast and mimosas today with Jennifer and had an absolutely wonderful time; fantastic food, great service, will return"}
{"text":"Every egg works establishment it's great and consistent!! Try news things every time I come!!! Had great service here today with Chelsea!!! Came here once and had Robert...horrible experience but the food made up for it!!! Great food, can't say it enough!!!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for breakfast!!! Typically change which egg works I go to depending on my day but all of them have great food and service! Definitely recommend trying something new every time and the menus at each place differ a little!!! It gets super packed on the weekends but it's worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast off the strip! The muffins are homemade goodness! Every dish in full size is plenty for two! Ask for the side of fruit great variety and all fresh!  Ask for server Donna, outstanding service!  Our new breakfast place for Vegas always when we are in town!"}
{"text":"Three of us went to Egg Works at about 11:00 AM on a Monday.  Fairly busy, but nothing like a Saturday or Sunday.  We were seated and given glasses of water. We asked for 2 coffee's and placed our order.  After about 15 minutes of sitting there our waiter walked by and we asked for our coffee a second time.  His reply \"I am moving as fast as I can\"  !!!  And that is all he said as he walked away.  What kind of response is this?   You would think an egg/breakfast restaurant would be prompt on coffee service.  We promptly got up and left.  We left not because of the wait, but because of the terrible response.  No \"I'm sorry\", no \"I'll get it right away\"  instead all he said was  \"I am moving as fast as I can\" !!!   If one of my employees said that to a customer I would fire them on the spot. This waiter is in the wrong line of work.  We proceeded to the Cracked Egg on Green Valley Blvd.   We had coffee brought to us within 2 minutes of sitting down and our meal within 10 minutes.  The Cracked Egg was a very pleasant experience compared to having to put up with the Egg Works employees' poor attitude.    All three of us agreed, we will never go back to the Egg Works."}
{"text":"In general, the food is well prepared here. I have a couple issues. #1 - They need to have place-mats on the tables and at the bar. I ordered coffee and needed the spoon to stir in the cream. I didn't have anywhere to set my wet spoon, nor the fork and knife except on the bare surface of the bar. I don't like doing this because of germs and what not. The bar was wiped down with a rag, but how clean is that rag? I don't set my silverware on a surface like that. So now I have to do a little balancing act by propping the fork and spoon on the edge of my knife. I could have set it on the napkin, but I don't feel okay with that either considering that I will be wiping my lips with it. A place-mat solves the issue. They could charge local businesses money for advertising space on the place-mat. It wouldn't cost them anything. #2 - The breakfast potatoes are not cooked to order. In fact, them come frozen. They aren't dicing any potatoes in that kitchen. They come straight out of a plastic bag and right into a fryer. They might even be pre-seasoned. These potatoes are kind of like little fried children's snacks. A traditional, diced, breakfast potato with onion and peppers would be much better. These little frozen potato nuggets are not good. I don't know why people seem to like them."}
{"text":"Thanks to my hotel's guide book which advertised this place as \"featured in Rachael Ray's show\" as well as great reviews on Yelp, I decided to come for brunch.    This place deserves 5 stars for originality.  The menu is like an 8-page newspaper full of creative dishes.  We got there on a Saturday noon and waited about 15 minutes or so.  I decided to check out the menu while I waited, and by the time I sat on the table, I was still torn between the stuffed french toast, crepes or an \"egg-ceptional omelette\"....so decided to ask the waitress, who recommended the seasonal PUMPKIN BANANA PANCAKES...which were not a bad choice.  My bf's huge omelette was a little overcooked for me, but was stuffed with looots of different ingredients and home fries (with a little too much seasoning!).  Since it was my first time, they brought us complimentary BANANA NUT MUFFINS that were warm, soft and delicious!  All in all, food is good (not amaaazing, just good), service was great, decor is really cute, farm like, and the dishes are super creative.  Portions are huge and prices more than reasonable.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Egg works is the prefect place for breakfast. With so many options in the area for breakfast it was a hard time to decide where to go, but after checking that the resturant was zagat rated and had great reviews we decided to check it out. The atmosphere inside is fun with wide area with many tables and booths to sit in which helped with us getting a table right away, the service was great and you get a free in house made muffin if it's your first visit. The options are amazing ranging from omelets to French toasts so any taste can be satisfied. They have great coffee and offer military discounts, so defenetly drop in if your in the mood for great food."}
{"text":"The best place to have breakfast away from the strip, food is delicious and great variety, can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant from a friend and thought I would give it a try the other morning. I walked in and was greeted immediately and walked to my table. A gentlemen stopped and asked if I would like some coffee. He brought me the coffee and poured me a cup and left. The coffee tasted bitter and cold and just plain awful. I looked around and waited....and waited...and waited...someone finally stopped and I asked if I could speak to a manager and she said she would send coco? right over. The young lady walked to what i presume was the manager. the lady was texting on her phone and never once looked away from it to even acknowledge the server speaking to her. When she walked away the manager still stood in the corner on her phone for what seemed like forever....i chose to get up and leave because i felt extremely dismissed and won't be back #feelingfrustrated"}
{"text":"The service was excellent, thank you Tamera! The turkey burger I ordered was ok, it had carrots in it (kind of weird) but other than that it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while in Vegas when we were headed out to red rock canyon to hike for the day. Was not disappointed!  The menu is extensive, but I had no problem finding something I would love. I ended up at the banana pancakes, eggs over easy, bacon and a side of sourdough toast. My friend ordered one of the many skillets offered. Her breakfast must've been perfect because she annihilated that skillet and didn't talk to me for the entire time we sat for breakfast. My breakfast, too, was excellent. The pancakes were light and fluffy. My eggs were cooked perfectly. And because they leave the carafe at the table, we were never without coffee.  Don't let the line to get in deter you. There were tons of people waiting to get in, but it only took us 15 minutes to get a table. The wait staff was friendly and attentive.  Eggs-traordinary breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Always packed on the weekend which means 30 to 40 min wait times, but the food and staff are always great!!!   :)"}
{"text":"Save your money and save your taste buds. Easily one of the most over rated places on yelp. Frozen hash browns??? McDonald's is better and a fraction of the cost. $8 for a single side pancake  and 3.25 for little cup of juice, these are ridiculous. Yelp you've failed me :("}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for breakfast in Las Vegas.On a weekend getaway to Vegas in for Labor Day weekend, we came here for breakfast twice. Then a few weeks later for a bachelorette party, I brought the group of girls here. Each time I came here, I've ordered something different, and each thing was delicious. On top of that, service was EGGcellent. My favorite of this place, the banana muffin. mmmm.   Note: If you pick up the those Vegas coupon books from your hotel lobby, gas station, and other random street corners, there's a coupon in there for buy one entree and get the second one free."}
{"text":"I'm currently sitting outside this fine establishment as the start of my vacation. I don't think I could've picked a better place to come. I ordered the prime rib benny. Everything about my order was perfection. My server is one of the nicest I've ever encountered. After my meal, she saw me just enjoying my coffee, so she brought me one of the best banana nut muffins I've ever had. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"First time coming here, and we love it! We sat outside on the patio, and the general atmosphere is super pleasant and nice. We aren't dog owners, but LOVE that their patio is dog friendly. We were seated as soon as we walked in the door, so no wait.   Our server Kelli was awesome. Such a sweet girl, checked on us often and made sure that we were satisfied. So super nice, you definitely have a wonderful employee in her.   The food was good, not out of this world amazing, but we enjoyed it. Daughter has the mouse pancake, which they made into a Minnie Mouse, complete with a bacon \"smile\", blueberry \"eyes and nose\" and orange slice \"eye lashes\". She loves pancakes and Minnie Mouse, so she definitely loved it.   Husband had the biscuits and gravy meal. He said the biscuits could have used a little more gravy, and the gravy needed a little more sausage, but otherwise really great meal. The potatoes are amazing, and don't have all that \"crap\" other places put in them (onions, peppers, etc).   I ordered the mushroom omelet, and a side of biscuits and gravy. The mushroom omelet was too much for me, so my husband ate that too. He said it was \"ok\", had to add hot sauce to it, but he ate the whole thing. I filled up totally on the small side of biscuits and gravy, and I thought it was delicious! I do agree that they could have had a little more gravy.   Overall we really love this little place and will definitely come back.   Tldr: the food was good, atmosphere pleasant, server Kelli amazing"}
{"text":"It took me a while to try this place out since it's always busy, but now I understand why they're always busy.... they're one of the best breakfast spots here in Vegas!   The ambiance is a cross between restaurant & a house out in the country. There may be a wait to be seated, but it's definitely worth it.   Their muffins are good (free for when you check-i ), biscuit & gravy was good, and the country fried steak was good.  Price is reasonable & the service is great!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time ever going to their  chain restaurant and I was impressed for several reasons.   Today happen to be Father's Day and my Dad decided to check this place out. We went and of course not only is it a Sunday morning but it's a Sunday Morning on Father's Day. The line was insane! I was worried because I only had 1.5 hours before I had to go into work. As soon as I saw the line my first though was \"This place better be worth it\" and \" I better be seated fast\". Once we reached the receptionist my name was at the bottom of the list to be called but they were constantly calling people to be seated and it only took max 10 minutes to be seated. I was highly impressed. I have never gotten faster service than I have at this place. We were seated at a booth that was a little snug for my family but it was still comfortable enough to eat in. I was surprised that the receptionist kept checking up on us to make sure that we were comfortable and even offered to give us a different table which was completely unnecessary. It was nice to have that sense that everyone in the restaurant wanted to make sure you were happy with not only your meal but the experience as well.  I ordered the Ruben sandwich which might not be the best breakfast choice but I thought it was delicious.  My parents tried the tostadas and they were HUGE and could probably feed two. Their chocolate chip pancakes were also really tasty. I am not a real big fan of breakfast food in general but after trying this place I definitely will reconsider my lack of appreciation for breakfast food. If you are looking for a casual, tasty and decently priced place I highly recommend this one."}
{"text":"The one time I visited this location was on a weekday morning. Wait time to be seated was five minutes. I was seated at a table and was drinking my coffee and eating a Santa Fe burrito shortly thereafter. The wait staff is excellent at this location.      This location of Egg Works is in a strip mall and has ample amounts of free parking. The food is delicious, especially if you enjoy eating eggs. The portion's are large and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"This place was so awesome!!!!!!! The selection was immaculate. I am vegetarian and thoroughly enjoyed your meatless options. I had your blueberry frenchtoast with potatoes and I also tried a bit of my friends enchilada omelette and also her banana muffin. The food was divinely seasoned. The muffin was so moist and not dry or hard lol. I could go on forever. It felt so homely. Such a comforting vibe. Also they have awesome amenities for kids. The train going around the restaurant and their menu selection was icing on the cake. Family place with a speedy service as well. Definitely coming here every time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were visiting from San Diego and saw this place had poppin' reviews so we stopped by! We were immediately seated, our server approached us quickly and brought out a carafe of coffee, and complimentary Banana Nut Muffins, which was very moist and delicious. After we perused through their detailed menu we ended up getting a Loaded Omelette and the Italian Skillet. The portions are huge, and the food was delicious. The price is fair and the atmosphere is laid back. Definitely coming back, next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Egg-mazing place to eat breakfast. My server, Juan was great at providing options that met my needs and likes ... we ended up with the Huevos Ranchero without cheese and sour cream. The green sauce was a perfect blend with all of the other flavors of the dish. The surprise of the morning was when opted for the fresh fruit ... no fruit cup here. Instead it was a blend of the freshest fruit I have ever had at a restaurant.... their was water melon, pineapple, grapefruit, cantaloupe, and honeydew."}
{"text":"A really good breakfast/brunch type place away from the hustle and bustle of LV Strip. I had the Corn Beef Hash & Banana Nut French Toast. Both were amazing.  Definitely coming here again for breakfast when I'm back in LV."}
{"text":"Always super busy in here because rainbow has become the new eastern avenue as far as restaurants and shopping . Saturday mornings would be hard to find a seat or avoid a small wait . As for the food it's really good . I always get skillets and never really change so they are all pretty good . It's a great breakfast spot . They have an outdoor patio that is dog friendly as well !"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast items, the potatoes are seasoned like crack.  The portions are big so it's probably worth sharing.  We had a Groupon so the value was great!!!  The coffee was extreme tasty.  Excellent service!"}
{"text":"I love Egg Works. The scary thing is that I could eat their potatoes forever. I love the Chicken Enchilada Omelette!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in vegas, the eggs are awesome.  The potatoes are my least favorite, you can tell they were frozen but I understand because this place gets busy. My favorite is the bloody mary,  so tasty. You can't have just one.  Customer services is great,  they are attentive and smiling."}
{"text":"This place is a bit more talked up than it really is. The wait is long but the food isn't really as good as you'd hope after such a long wait. I got the banana pancakes, not realizing they just had bananas on top. Kinda funny. Service there is good but seems a lot of work for something not as good as I'd hope. The atmosphere is nice which is a plus! Not too bad but not my favorite either."}
{"text":"Love this place ! My boyfriend and I come here all the time ! Their muffins are bomb and the staff is super sweet !"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast and great service from Tamara!! She is such a sweetheart and we can't wait to come back again!! Thanks for making our day incredible!!  ToniAnn & Terry"}
{"text":"Nice place and all. Always highly rated. But it's too cold in here. And the waitress told us they aren't allowed to raise the temperature because the equipment would freeze up. So get better equipment already!  Eating in a cold restaurant isn't pleasant, right?"}
{"text":"Four travelers passing through las Vegas for a couple days, we picked this place for breakfast and it did not disappoint!  Our waitress was nice enough to tell us honestly that the cappucino was not worth ordering, but our cheesesteak, Santa Cruz skillet, stuffed french toast and veggie crepe were all fantastic.    Pro tip: almost anything can be ordered in a half portion (half price + 1.50) and is still a generous helping!    Would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Caitlyn was great!  Send her to Disney!  Food is great! Sit at the bar and be entertained by the kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"we were on our way for groceries this morning (bleh) so we thought we should have smthn in our bellies 1st. came here since this location is close to home.  it was around 10am on tues and they were super busy, however we managed to get a table right away... like 3 inches away from the other table :/  the table was tiny and filled w/stuff (sweetners, jelly, condoments, etc.) i just felt really cramped from the get go. service was meh... our server was rushed, spoke super fast, didnt introduce herself or tell us what the little yellow/black egg thingy meant. the only reason we knew was from reading it on here... thx yelpers!!! anyhow... back to our bkfst... i ordered a small stack of whole wheat pancakes n a side of turkey bacon, husband got the cornbeef hash/eggs combo plate... our super close neighbors got their meals really fast, but for some reason ours took 27 minutes to come out... our server kind of glanced over n i saw the suprised \"oh shit\" look on her face when she realized we ddnt have our food yet.  she didnt apologize or anything (which is fine, we werent in a rush) soooo... the food was aiight, nothing spectacular... and it took forever, annnd it was $25 for 2 bkfsts.  we probably wont be back.   oh ya! one last thing; we did the free banana muffins for checking in thru yelp!!! yayyy!!"}
{"text":"The cutie and I went here and we had such an amazing time!!!The food was great and the employees were very accommodating!!! Him and I both loved the food!!!Highly recommended :D!!!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a local Hawaii spot because of it's gargantuan proportions!  They even had a Hawaiian breakfast section!  I had the homemade corned beef hash which was amazing. U could tell that the corned beef was homemade and pulled right before cooking with the potatoes.   Tried the pancakes and waffles and they were amazing. I mean, in general, I don't think anyone can get pancakes and waffles wrong, right??!!??  Kids pancakes were cute because they made it into Mickey Mouse's face with a bacon smiley face =)  This is a place you wanna come with a large group so you can try a little bit of everything. And even then, I'm sure everyone will still have a large amount to finish eating.   This place was so yummy that I ate here 2 days in a row."}
{"text":"I live close by.  I always come here around 11-12 or sometimes later before I go to the windmill/rainbow library to do my readings.  It's cheap and better than any fastfood.  I can't complain.  Naomi one of the cashiers is always nice to me with her beautiful smile and all the servers are so nice to me too.  I used to go to starbucks all the time but now I come here.  Unless they come up with an organic breakfast place exactly in the same location for convenience, I'll always come here.  Nobody's forcing me to come here.  It's not for everybody.  It's either you like it or you don't.  If you don't, then don't come here.  If you do, then I'll see you here.  Don't forget to say hi!"}
{"text":"Great Breakfast chain. My go to place for a Perfect Omelet. I order the 1/2 size not on menu. I also order half potato/ fruit.  Great service, Trendy. Fun place to bring company."}
{"text":"My go to breakfast spot when in the area. I almost always  eat a banana nut muffin followed by a  small 2 egg vegetable omelette with split potatoes / fruit , and coffee. All for 10.02 inc.tax  a few years ago it was under 8.00, still cheap. I can never finish either. Everyone always gets gets the regular size portion, which is huge. It's just a waste.  They have perfectly seasoned potatoes, good muffins."}
{"text":"Yum this place is an eggscellent choice for brunch! I came here today for the first time today and have to say this is one of the best brunch/breakfast places I've been to ever. My fiancé and I shared the stuffed French toast with fruit and the country fried steak with their Habla diablo potatoes. We also got free banana nut muffins for checking in on yelp! The banana muffin was very good- moist and full of flavor. Then our entrees came... the potatoes were SO good! And they give you tons. I liked my stuffed French toast... if you're looking for something savory and sweet, this is a great option! The French toast was stuffed full of scrambled eggs and sausage links, and topped with powder sugar. Tastes great with the maple syrup too! My fiancé's country fried steak was also delicious. The gravy was so good with the country fried steak!   This place is delicious, super affordable ($10 -$12 dishes) and has generous portions. What more can you ask for? I'll definitely be back when I come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great prices i paid $20 for 2 meals! The services is always great! They always go above and beyond! I come eat here almost every sat!!!! The food is delicious!!! This is definitely my morning place. We recently went back and was served by victoria who i believe is one of the managers there! Her service was amazing!! Brought us extra cream for our coffees, boxes to go, and lids for our syrups! She was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"After deciding an hour and 45 minute wait at Cracker Barrel was just not worth the wait, we decided to venture out and so glad we did! This place was delicious! I have zero complaints about the service or the food, simply delicious! Ashley our server made our experience very fun and I would definitely come back again! Very cool local spot."}
{"text":"What can I say.. Egg Works is the jam.  Always a good time coming in and getting down on some awesome breakfast grub.  The staff is always attentive and always willing to accommodate.  The Works Veggie Benny is the bomb and the portion is good enough for a guy like me.  Also, although I never had them here, the mimosas available is a nice touch; something a few of my friends were willing to consider after a long night of traveling and needing to relax.  Definitely a grubbin' spot and a sure favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"Great location and a local institution. I have been going to this egg works for probably 10 years or more.   Yeah its not as spiffy and hip as Hash house a gogo.  But they serve large good portions at really great prices.  Their pancakes are wonderful, Waffles...especially when ordered with meat inside are heavenly. All of their egg dishes are great....the standard comes with 4 eggs ( get your lipitor ready...ha).  Never had a bad meal here and they can accommodate  large parties.  Be forewarned weekends are crazy busy here!"}
{"text":"Melissa was awesome!!!!!!    Came in first thing right as yall opened with a coworker. And we thoroughly enjoyed our delicious meals (loaded skillet for me with toast and a banana nut muffin and my buddy had the waffles and eggs).  Eggs were perfectly cooked. Fresh fruit. Fresh orange juice. And the potatoes.   This wasn't my first time. And I come back for the potatoes alone. The service is outstanding.   Melissa needs to go to To six flags though.  More coasters!!!!"}
{"text":"So good!  Eggs Benedicts are yummy, very traditional and good portion.   Michael was in heaven!  My Denver omelette was huge and very filling. Very crowded, specially on weekends. Thinking it's better to stop by after 11am"}
{"text":"Asst. Mgr Marc welcomed and served us our drinks. Waiter, Tely provide an exceptional service a true Egg Works ambassador. Also, my compliments to the chef!"}
{"text":"Came in here on a Friday morning with my husband and our son and we left with our bellies full and happy.  It was our first time and we were pleasantly surprised about the service and portions of food, as we came in there staaarrrving.  Our waiter was Christian and he was great.  He was very entertaining and on point with all of our orders, not needing the assistance of a pad and pen.  Definitely plan on going there again when we're in that area."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Egg Works.  Especially since they have \"Cincy Chili\".  I don't know what chili they ate in Cincinnati, but Skyline IN A CAN is better than what they serve.  The pros - Service was outstanding.  We were quickly seated and our server (young man on Saturday dayshift) was attentive and funny.  The food - On the first visit I tried the Cincy Chili.  It just wasn't good.  On this visit, I went with eggs, biscuits, and gravy.  It wasn't good either.  You can't really screw up eggs, but the gravy and biscuits had all the thrill of cardboard.   To my server's credit, he noticed I wasn't eating much and did offer to replace it with something else, but I didn't have time as I had an appointment.  My dining companions got the egg skillets and also commented that they felt it was just average food."}
{"text":"Love the service here all the time I come to vegas always come here to eat my breakfast . Today I ordered Denver omelette and Jennifer was so good and friendly and on top of her service thank you"}
{"text":"Kathleen was a very good server.  Offered us to go cups for our drinks.  Food was very good.  Love the banana nut muffin. Would go here again."}
{"text":"This is the only chain that I know of with awesome egg bennies so when I get to pick out breakfast, this is where I go.  Front of the house was a little awkward teenage girl, I think with training she can blossom into a friendly hostess.  The veggie Benny is the best!! It always brightens up my morning. Providing flavored cream for coffee is an extra plus. (Hazelnut hands down). My other half ordered the Waffle Works which he found was mediocre.  Our waitress was the lovely Candice. I absolutely enjoyed her enthusiasm. My boyfriend thought she was too peppy for his tastes but after our meal, he said she became bearable. He's grumpy when he's hungry.  The cashier seemed agitated too. I guess anyone in the lobby area isn't as chipper as Candice. Way to set the standards Candice!"}
{"text":"Works Veggie Benny was delicious! Loved their special Works potatoes, like little potato poppers. The plate had so much, I couldn't eat it all!  The hostess and server were very kind and quick to seat as well as take our orders.   The tacky decorations and menu can go though. If it's made of cheap newspaper, you would think they would throw them away. Good for you for recylcing but its unsanitary to reuse that."}
{"text":"The food was OK, it's breakfast you can't screw it up too much. Had the wonderful opportunity to experience Jennifer's service. I order dry wheat toast, gives it to me with butter...its a mistake. No big deal. I ask for toast without butter. 10 minutes later I get the toast. I'm done now! She was to busy helping sit another customer when there was already a hostess who's job was to seat people. After she seats them she goes in the back and runs her mouth some more and then finally realizes she forgot the toast. Jennifer, I was not upset about the mistake of the toast I was upset by your poor services I need the toast when I got my food not when I'm done."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! The Italian skillet was tasty and fresh, the Mexican burrito was spicy and filling. Dolly was our very attentive and courteous waitress."}
{"text":"Am from Chicago on a two week business trip and have gone to several places for breakfast until I came upon this place.  I gave been coming here every day since . I always as for Nicole E's section.  She has taken very good care of us.  You can not go wrong here"}
{"text":"Our server, Sara, was amazing. Our food was fast, hot, yummy, accurate and inexpensive. I always special order stuff and Sara was kind and listened to my order. Thank you, Egg Works, for a great breakfast."}
{"text":"I've been here many many times and Everytime it's just as amazing! The regular coffee is good quality and I don't usually like plan hot coffee. The chicken fried steak skillet is wonderful! I've never liked this dish until I came here and this is the only place I order it. The gravy is delicious. Customer service is always great and the place is always busy."}
{"text":"Thank you Arianna for the excellent service on our stop at Egg Works today!   I had a BLT with fresh fruit.  The  BLT was piled  high with bacon,  lettuce and tomato.  My  husband is on a special diet and had to make several changes to brad's scramble which was no problem for Arianna!  it was delicious &prepared correctly. The banana nut muffin which is  homemade is not to be missed. We will  be back soon."}
{"text":"For some reason, our GPS unit and 2 cell phones couldn't find this place?  If you are from out of town like we were, good luck.  Ended up giving the restaurant a call in order to find it.  It's located inside a business center, blending in with the other buildings.  After developing an appetite after driving in circles, we finally found the place.  Arrived in the later part of the day.  So we were lucky to be seated right away and were the last to leave.  I have to agree that the banana muffins are so good.  Pounded that muffin in seconds.  All the food was good, somewhat on the pricey side for breakfast food."}
{"text":"Wide variety of food to choose from. Debra our server was great! I don't eat eggs and there was still plenty on the menu for me."}
{"text":"Always a go to breakfast/brunch spot for us. Everything I've gotten has been consistently fantastic. And have you tried the banana nut muffins??!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast place. Nothing  fancy just good hearty breakfast joint.  No ambiance but food is good. Only breakfast restaurant have peanut butter for free of charge for your bread."}
{"text":"First off Cece is great! I came in with a headache and she cured it with banana pancakes and a mimosa. I'm not talking just any mimosa you'd get in a tiny champagne flute but a big girl sized mimosa served in a Mason jar!!! Cece was funny and attentive. The food was great, banana pancakes for me and my friend got the Country Benny over easy. It was busy but no one rushed us out."}
{"text":"Food was great ...service was something that needs to be improved ..my waitress Candace waited about 10 minutes before asking if I want something to drink she was very loud with The other waitstaff talking about inappropriate subjects....Great food but not a good family restaurant"}
{"text":"Came back here for another try. Got a bigger table and service was great. Our food looks and tastes delicious. Very friendly staff. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Great food. Amazing service. A real breakfast favorite. Manuela is the most helpful server, definitely recommend this place and Manuela as well!"}
{"text":"amazing service amazing food & they sat us down super quick! did i mention we were a party of 10! would definetly come back!!"}
{"text":"This fun breakfast food spot has a train that runs around the inside ceiling perimeter. I came here for lunch and chose a crepe filled with turkey cheese and mushroom. It was quite tasty. But the best part were the potatoes with the special flavoring sprinkled on them. It was so delicious that I bought a bottle of seasoning to bring home at the cash register.  The service was amazing!! I'd eat here again, happily!!"}
{"text":"Always great breakfast and service is super nice. Especially Brandy super helpful and accommodating!!! Will always return for more. Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for breakfast a couple of weeks ago. The food was phenomenal!! I ordered a Greek scramble and my husband got the enchilada omelette. The eggs were delicious, but the potatoes were AMAZING! Seriously, so good! We also received complimentary banana nut muffins as it was our first visit. They were also really good. I can't wait to make this place a regular stop. My only advice would be to ask for light butter on your toast if you don't like it drowning. I do, so I was happy about it, by I could see some people thinking it's too much. Oh and their sweet tea is legit!"}
{"text":"Stopped by while in Vegas since I had a groupon for this place. The boyfriend got a \"4 way\" Cincinnati Chili while I had a Hawaiian platter breakfast (2 eggs, sunny side up, Portuguese sausage, 2 scoops of rice, 2 slices of toast, and 1 slice of pineapple). We shared everything - and we also had some spam.  Service was a little slow, but this place seems to get packed rather quickly, so if you go before  9:30AM, it might be a little better. When we got there, there weren't a ton of people, but by the time we sat down and ordered, the crowd started to pour in.  They have a \"paging\" system much like that of Bubba Gump or other restaurants. Black side of the egg has a happy face on it, denoting that you're OK and do not need assistance. The yellow sad face catches the waiter/waitress' attention and they stop to help you with whatever you may need. Waitresses were very courteous, however, down to the point. Who can blame them though? It got rather busy quickly. No small talk or anything like that, just straight to the point. Not a bad thing, just an observation of what I noticed.   Cincinnati chili, as my boyfriend described it, was \"not Skyline, but can pass as Cincinnati chili. More like Dixie chili.\" Not as watery as Skyline, a bit more flavorful in my opinion (more spices in it). Not as cheesy as Skyline though.  The Hawaiian breakfast platter of course, was good. Well, to be fair, it really is hard to mess up on sunny side up eggs so I'll skip that. They tasted like eggs. The sour dough toast, well, it was sour dough toast - so I'll skip that as well. Not sure what else to write about since everything else on that plate tasted as it should have. I've never quite had an \"exceptional\" quality Hawaiian breakfast, so... The spam was just spam that was pan fried, no teriyaki sauce marinade. I guess the fact that it tastes like what it's supposed to and looks the way it is supposed to is a plus though. Food tasting like anything other than what it is sometimes odd and could be a bad thing.   I did not get a chance to have their omelets or egg crepes, but I will definitely be back to try again another time. A nice little gem a bit off of the strip. They also have several locations in Vegas area as well."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch..big portions and delicious food:). If you're like me who doesn't finish the whole plate, Egg works offer half order portions. Staff are friendly and attentive always happy to bring you what you need. Check in and get a free banana nut muffin (even better grilled)!"}
{"text":"Rating is 4 because  - excellent service  - friendly  - wait time for 2 is only about 10min and they text you when the seat is ready  - -1 star bc it's too much for me. What's too much? It's literally heart stopper with high calorie and there's no fruit/salad. Better, cheese, mayo... lots of salt.. you'd like it if you're into that kind of stuff. Not my favorite. I won't order California crepe again. Potatoes are good, again it's very salty.     What we ordered  - California crepe with bacon mushroom and cheese  - banana muffin from Yelp check in  - classic eggs Benedict  - lemonade  - coffee   Tip:  Now I like it when my drinks are unlimited refill so I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"Fast, good breakfest food and the service was spot on amazing. I loved our waitress she was really helpful. We had a flight to catch and she got us in and out fast. She even wrapped up our lunch order prefectly to take with us on the plane.   Thank you"}
{"text":"The menu here is fairly extensive, which is great for an indecisive person like myself. It's always busy, but the service is usually timely, a few times I've had to wait waaay too long to place my order. I have gotten undercooked food or an incorrect order here on more than one occasion as well."}
{"text":"Ta da! Now that is how breakfast is supposed to be done. My spinach and feta scrambled eggs were cooked to perfection. I don't usually eat toast but I couldn't resist. And I love how they offered the choice of fruit instead of potatoes. Gotta cut calories somewhere! There is a wait to be seated but who cares when you're around great company, conversation and friends for the wait. Now go get you some breakfast!"}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast here on a day trip to Vegas.  The server, Christopher, was amazing.  He asked if we had ever been there before.  We hadn't, so he brought us some complimentary banana nut muffins which were really moist and delicious.  I ordered a skillet that was big enough to feed three people!  My hubby ordered an omelette and he was able to customize it the exact way he wanted it.  The food and service was en pointe.  I would absolutely come back, especially for those yummy muffins!"}
{"text":"The food here is da bomb.com! They serve real down home cooking.  The food is always prepared fresh and piping hot when you receive it. If you haven't tried it, you'd better get over there and see for yourself. The service is also great."}
{"text":"They have the best Banana Nut muffins, great customer service and the food is delicious. Jaime is an awesome server."}
{"text":"Breakfast was very good, service was very good too.  Add, they have a Bloody Mary mix which beats out many of the others brands I've purchased. They have me saying: Sí \"Hablo Diablo\" Saving the one star for another visit. (I'm not local)"}
{"text":"That can I say other than it is amazing. We stopped by for breakfast and loved it. We were in Vegas for vacation and wanted to get off the strip for food. So glad we found this place. I ordered the traditional Benny and my husband got the chicken fried steak. All the food was excellent and came out fast.  I think we found our new breakfast place in Vegas."}
{"text":"Service was great, and I was seated right away, but food was lacking. I really enjoyed my omelette but they may as well not bothered bringing me fruit as it was sliced brine and grapefruit (yuck). Patio was freezing yet the sun was shining, they should open it up and let the sun shine through.  There's free wifi that's fast and they didn't mind that I brought my Starbucks in either. Bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Egg works did not \"Work-out\" too well for me ;-/ Which Is a shame because I love LOVEEEEE breakfast....I can have It for lunch, dinner you name It. I Imagined this place to be near \"Mind-Blowing\" because I had heard many great things about It but to my disappointment It was not up to par. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash meal to go, service was speedy so I do have to give them that but the staff did seem to be  too busy talking amongst themselves to greet properly, The one girl who took my order was a bit snooty.   My hash was not good, It had a really strong beef taste like they had just taken It off the cattle and the eggs had a rubbery texture to It., Not at all what I expected :-("}
{"text":"This place is an amazing breakfast/ lunch spot! Amazing menu with a ton of options to choose from. Generous portions and flavorful dishes!  We sat on the outdoor patio and had the prime rib eggs Benedict, and the veggie skillet!  Our server, Nicole, was amazing! Very knowledgable about the menu and offered recommendations and was very accommodating. We will be back just to see her!"}
{"text":"We really want to find a great breakfast place. We were hoping this would be it. We have made three trips to this location. Each time, the server was pleasant but the orders come out wrong. How do onions end up in a blueberry pancake? I ordered the chicken burrito and it was awful. The rice was so gross and tasteless. My husbands breakfast potatoes were so overly season salted they were inedible. The servers have been great each time but the food was gross. Also, most restaurants don't charge to have a child's milk refilled."}
{"text":"About the same price as IHOP, which is a little overpriced for breakfast food, however I would choose egg works over ihop( four stars for the overpriced food.) there is a farmer boys right across the street with breakfast food that is not overpriced and just as good, the main reason for the four stars instead of five, I would not eat here if I did not have a groupon. Other then that the service is great and the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Food is good but just don't sit at the counter where you see all the servers counting their tips and complaining and then touching food without washing their hands!!!"}
{"text":"My go to breakfast spot. The atmosphere is always upbeat and friendly, and inviting. The staff is on point and extremely helpful.   The menu is very robust and easy to read. I typically stick to the skillets, but occasionally I'll try something different. I just feel the skillets are the best, I get a little of my favorites; eggs, a meat or two, and the best potatoes in the city!   So if you're new to the city, or just passing through, this is the breakfast place! Don't forget the banana muffin!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast spot.  We've been here a couple times now on past trips to the area.   Tons of menu options,  and so far everything I've had has been great.   My only wish is that they were open for dinner!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. Lisa T was our waitress and she did a great job, very friendly and nice person. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Our server Donna rocked it!  Place was jam packed, wait was 15mins but always well worth the wait!  Can't give this place enough stars"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, AMAZING food. I couldn't believe it honestly. I had the California Crepes, but what really blew my mind was the potatoes! Yum! I was the only one who got the potatoes, and everyone at the table ate some of my potatoes.  Our server Ashley was fantastic, she took care of us, and got out food out quick!   Definitely would come again! SEE YANIN JANUARY!"}
{"text":"Nicole was super nice and friendly . I love Egg works and I can't wait to come back . This new location is super nice"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast joint in Vegas.  They have all of your favorite traditional American breakfast stuff with all of the fixins.  The service staff is superb and they turnover the best stuff!  It's open early, but it closes early, too.  Perfect location for your stop on the way into town or on your way to the airport!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a lot of good things going for it, and judging by the price and the number of people in the dining room, they do what they do well.   The menu is enormous. So there are many choices, but the downside is they can't do all this stuff super well. It's good, but wouldn't say it's great or fantastic. It's a step above Denny's.  Service was/is always great."}
{"text":"Delicious food at reasonable prices served by friendly staff. Love this place. Caitlin took care of me at the kitchen bar (as she has a few times prior). She is a friendly and efficient server."}
{"text":"Veggies rotten and smelly. 2.95 for diner/gas station coffee.   Waitress was pleasant though."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and location. The staff is nice and the food is delicious! I got the veggie Benny and the holendays sauce was sooooo good. (sorry I know I spelled that wrong lol) I reccomend this place to anyone who loves eggs!"}
{"text":"Awesome every time I go.. fast friendly service...food is delicious chili reano omelet awesome..."}
{"text":"This chain is probably one of Vegas' best kept secrets. The food tastes consistently good, and the prices are great for what you get.   Came to this location recently for brunch and on a weekday this place was packed. I was able to score a Groupon voucher a few months ago which made our meal even cheaper. Our waitress was very nice and help us make a decision on our order since the menu is gigantic and had sooo many choices. I got the egg benny (there are 5 different benny's to choose from), and my friend got the skillet also 5 different ones to choose from. The variety is great if you like lots and lots of choices. Best part is that breakfast is served pretty much all day, so for those of us that love their eggie stuff, you can still get that in the afternoon.   The portions are huge! Neither of us could finish our food. Do not expect anything super healthy here as everything is made to taste good which they do. Bathrooms are clean, parking was easy to find."}
{"text":"From the outside, I almost kept driving, but inside, I was greeted by smiling waitresses, pleasant country decor, and LOTS of flat screen tv's, and most of all, a unique and tasty selection of breakfast choices! A refreshing alternative to the stupid craziness in eating on the strip! You won't be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"The food was great. I thought the prices were about $1-2 higher than they should be. However, I had the three pigs omelette and it was the best omelette I've ever had. I like mine kind of dry and not very fluffy...no really I do. If you like a moist and fluffy omelette I would ask them to cook it a bit less than usual. For my taste, it was perfect.  Good service from Natasha."}
{"text":"I am so happy that this location is on the south side of town!! I can come in for a banana nut muffin whenever my heart desires now:)  This location strives in all aspects of a breakfast spot in my opinion... -Friendly staff -Quick service -Delicious food  I understand that I am pretty understanding when it comes to service since I am in the industry...  BUT... That doesn't change the fact that Egg Works is great. They impressed me in my grumpiest state...which is in the mornings ...when I have to wake up and start my day ...*sighs*   I've ordered pretty much something from every part of their menu over the years but my favorite has to be their eggs benedict...SO DELICIOUS...they serve their seasoned racheros potatoes with most of their dishes which is another highlight of the place.  All of their omelets are amazing but beware...their portions are HUGE. Which is probably the only reason I don't order an omelet every time I come. They will also do all egg white omelets upon request for a few dollars extra.   A MUST HAVE... Do not skip out on their banana nut muffins...I don't care if you're on a diet or you just don't like muffins...you HAVE TO get one...They are served warm,fresh, and delicious.  Egg Works is just adorable. The layout of the restaurant is great and the atmosphere is family oriented and kid friendly. One of my favorite parts is their egg sign on every table to notify servers that they need service. One side is an egg with a happy face if you are doing great and the other side is a sad face if you need something."}
{"text":"I love this location!  Close to home and everyone is super friendly!  Especially Candice-she was our server. Today I ate the Veggie-Benny-my new favorite!  All the plates come with a side of spicy crisp potatoes. Try the banana nut muffin!"}
{"text":"PK rocks!  The best waiter EVER! No matter what you order you'll be pleased with what hits the table.  The waffles are the best!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in town! Taylor is awesome,  ask for him! Great service and food!"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast as usual!! Blueberry pancake sandwich, yeah buddy!!  The service was top notch, a special shout out to our server DONNA!!!"}
{"text":"Reliable quality food at great prices...service is always on point .I recommend the you get your banana  muffin with a side of peanut butter"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! The food was absolutely incredible!!! The service was kind of slow, but that's only because it was very busy! Overall, it was a wonderful experience and the food will have me coming back every time I am in the area. I highly recommend this place (and I'm not even a fan of breakfast foods)!!!"}
{"text":"Great place good shape you should check them out great location their selections pretty I mean pretty much anything you want very clean friendly nice atmosphere located on in the Summerlin area prices are reasonable very clean I hope you enjoy their food"}
{"text":"I had something called the 5 way. Boy it was big and good. We had a sweet little waitress. So sweet and kept an eye on us."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the BEST breakfast spots! It was my first time here and it exceeded my expectations. When you walk in it looks like an average size place but once you're fully in the place is pretty big !   They have numerous breakfast choices and unique ones too! I had their special of the day and absolutely LOVED it. Very fast food for sure. The customer service is amazing as well.  The whole staff there seems really nice and attentive to all the guests.   This location is a little hidden but I know they have a few so definitely recommend them if you're in the search for a great breakfast ."}
{"text":"I've been here several times before and the food is always great, but just had to comment on a phenomenal server we had for brunch on Christmas Eve. Oscar was one of the best servers I've ever encountered. Friendly, calm, attentive and pleasant. We had a party of six that included two kids and he was so patient and kind. The world needs more Oscars and I hope he's recognized for his terrific work."}
{"text":"I think we were expecting too much from Egg Works. The coffee was superb, though. Waitress confused me when she asked if I wanted any special creamer... \"uhhh, what?\"  ...but they've got the flavored International Delight stuff hiding in the back. She was cool and left a carafe at the table because obviously I give out the I want a lot of coffee vibe.   The food though, meh. Portions are huge, lumberjacks could eat here! I had eggs Benedict and found the Hollandaise quite salty. I think it's a Las Vegas thing to put olives on top for decoration, nay to that. Boyfriend had \"stuffed French toast\" and we both assumed it would be a more decadent, dessert like dish than a basic egg/sausage scramble French toast sandwich. Oh well. That's what you get for assuming. They don't do hash browns here, rather they have their own sort of country style potatoes. Now these were WELL seasoned, another friend of ours doesn't like to eat at Egg Works because of this. However, we found the potatoes to be the best part of the meal (besides the coffee) We both at half and took the rest home, potatoes heat up nicely in a skillet as leftovers.  Tidbits: There's a neat electric train running around the top of the foyer where you pay. A lot of outdoor seating it appears, but seem to be understaffed and these sections were closed off. Happy/sad egg sign at each table to fetch a server for attention, brilliant idea.  Forgot to use our Yelp check-in offer for a free muffin :("}
{"text":"Got the biscuits and gravy... The sausage gravy was legit. A little on the saltier side but definitely flavorful. The biscuits were nice and fluffy. And their breakfast potatoes are the bomb! Jennifer was our server and she was super friendly"}
{"text":"They had me at banana nut muffin!!! I go there just for the muffin lol. The service has always been wonderful. The food is great also with just one recommendation if they could lay off the salt. . My favorite is the breakfast Berger yumm....."}
{"text":"The banana nut muffin thing is the best.  My hubby orders a skillet most every time, and I get the eggs benedict.  The food is always very good, as is the service.  The coffee is weak and the water tastes funny.  Also, the atmosphere is better at the Sahara location.  We will continue to visit both locations."}
{"text":"The service was great!  The food was amazing! It was our first time going to Egg Works, my husband had to convince me to go, I was a bit iffy about going, once we received our food, the look and the smell was mouth watering, it was delicious! Definitely going again! Instead of Ihop this will be our official Go-To place for Breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is the best brunch spot in the Rainbow 215 area!! The bacon and onion skillet is always our favorite.  The steak and eggs was just meh, steak is very thin so it cooks to one temperature... done."}
{"text":"After yesterday's terrible breakfast at Breakfast Bar, I decided to treat myself to something tried and true. You can't go wrong with Egg Works. It's impossible to have a bad meal here! I have never once been dissatisfied with any meal I've had at any location. It's always good! The banana nut muffins are on point. Potatoes are seasoned perfectly, I like them sour cream.  I've been going to Egg Works and Egg and I for over ten years. I've tried a lot of the things on the menu and it's all good.  Omelets are where my heart is but the carrot cake French toast-oui, OUI! So if you can get your hands on some do that! Thank me later! Dog friendly patios, great service...there are few places you can get a better breakfast. I don't think you can. I brought my parents here years ago and they STILL talk about it! I am a travel agent so whenever I come across someone coming to Vegas I recommend this place. This location dropped off banana bread to where I work as a gift and it was literally gone in ten minutes."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for bunch with a friend. Great service and food came out quickly. They also gave us a free muffin as it was my friend's first time eating there. I think our server's name was Victoria and she was awesome! Great recommendations (the mash potato and bacon omelette was delicious) and she was very attentive. I also noticed she was great with the kids on the table next to us. Will definitely go back and hope she's working. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Big portions and delicious food! The only down side is how crazy packed it gets on weekends.."}
{"text":"Really love egg works!!  Today I had the balsamic glazed chicken salad...it was awesome!!  Service was excellent throughout with the very capable Lisa C taking care of us.  Can't wait for cooler weather so we can be back out on their gorgeous patio!  Snag a groupon before you go that makes it even nicer!!"}
{"text":"We love coming here service is always top notch and the food is awesome!  I love that you can get the skillet breakfasts half size . Make sure to get the epoxy app one of my entrees today is free!!  Coffee is the best not too strong or weak and ask for the flavored creamers!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm so impressed by this place! The food AND service was phenomenal. This was my second time in, and I sat at the bar because I was in a hurry. My server was Robert. He was very friendly and nice. He took my order quickly after I sat and had my drink within seconds. I asked a few questions and he made recommendations. My food got to me super quick and I even got my check at the perfect time and was told to take my time. Let me say that I'm a pretty harsh critic, I am a waitress and I usually get annoyed easily. I have nothing bad to say about this place. I got eggs, potatoes, turkey sausage, and toast. The potatoes are so amazing! Different from other places! Seasoned just right. All my food was cooked perfect. (I hate runny eggs or if they are brown) I will never ever go anyplace else again. Goodbye to all the other places I frequent. For breakfast, this is the place to go! Thanks Robert for being an awesome server! And all of the other employees were friendly too. Somebody even remembered my name. I'm so impressed!!!"}
{"text":"Tremendous. Food is awesome. Andrea is the best server; always patient with me and happy to see me. Don't forget to check in and get your free banana nut muffin. They give you your own coffee carafe so you don't have to ask for refills and the coffee is terrific. Go for the half size omelet it is plenty and so many tasty choices. The potatoes are the best in town."}
{"text":"We were on a mission to find Egg Works but the one on West Flamingo, were driving around aimlessly and low and behold we run right into this one. We had tried the Egg and I so we said lets see what the sister location has to offer. Happy to say the same great food and menu as Egg and I. This location is newer and has a different look and feel. The thing that stands out immediately are the 7+ plasma screens throughout the restaurant. The service here was quick and efficient. They also had the same wonderful banana nut muffin. This time we decided to try the country benny and the works skillet. Both items were great and plentiful. There are so many items on the menu, a bit overwhelming. This location is a hop skip and a jump from the airport runway, they are in a strip mall right next to a Wells Fargo bank. I'm still not a fan of their potatoes, it would be great if they offered hash browns too. I do recommend this place to anyone who wants to get away from casino fare and wants a hearty breakfast with great service."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars except for the potatoes, very boring. Otherwise the omelets are da bomb. I really love the chicken enchilada one with the yummy red sauce, tortillas and green chiles, as good as it gets. And don't miss out on the house specialty, banana nut muffins to die for, I could probably eat half a dozen of them! They also appear to have killer burgers too. Will have to try one for lunch next time. Our server was nice and helpful.  This area is really nice in Vegas too, not too far from Red Rock so its a nice leisurely drive to get there."}
{"text":"When it comes to breakfast this is where we go all the time. We love this place for breakfast. I feel sick eating at those other places that come to mind. Here not once have we felt sick or miserable afterwards all day. We feel stuffed because the portions are a lot, leftovers usually. The service is great and friendly (most of the time, as long as they understand, well you know.) I could go on and on with how delicious and plentiful the food is, the items on the menu are a great find as well, lots to choose from, lots, I said, LOTS! You can't lose with this place, if your a BIG eater and breakfast lover, you'll love it."}
{"text":"A home town feel, country music, amazing service and food ALWAYS! Banana nut muffins are the best, they are hot, moist and melt in your mouth. Makes my mouth water just thinking about them. My husband usually gets an omelette, he's had almost all of them. They are huge, filling and he has never not liked any of them and the seasoned potatoes that come with it are to die for. He always gets a side of biscuits and gravy. The gravy is just like mom makes....delicious. I get a little of everything when I go there. The country fried steak is one of my favorites. This last time I got soup and salad, the soup was veggie beef and I was pleasantly surprised how delicious it was. Im picky about soup but Im not sure why I would be surprised because Ive never had anything I haven't liked there yet."}
{"text":"Always amazing, flavors that tantalize your taste buds and melt in your mouth kinda food! The food seasoned so great there is no need to add salt, pepper or hot sauces! The gravy is the best, usually Im drowning my gravy in hot sauce at other places. Our server was Manny and he was amazing."}
{"text":"With so many breakfast places to choose from, how do you choose just one? That was my dilemma being from out of town and looking for a good breakfast place. With some recommendations from a friend who is a local from the Las Vegas area, this place is very highly recommended. And for myself, I would recommend and will definitely return when I am back in the area.  We got here way early before the morning rush, about 7 am. Easily found park and got seated in no time. It is very homey inside, with dining tables and a breakfast bar with additional seating. Our servers were very attentive, making sure we had everything we needed.  For those who love coffee (like me), their coffee is unlimited!! Yes that's right, they even give you the entire mug of coffee pourer to have at your table. And if you like flavored coffee, they have small creamers available at the table too.   For food, I got the veggie Benedict with their homemade potatoes. The veggies on top of the english muffin were avocados, tomatoes, and spinach. Everyone tasted too good! My favorite were probably their homemade potatoes. It had a cajun taste and it was not oily or soggy at all, unlike most homestyle potatoes. Some of the smaller potatoes were even had a little crunch to it. My boyfriend got the country fried steak, which he said was very good. I got to taste the gravy that was on top and yes it was very tasty!  Their menu is fairly large so next time I come back I will definitely try something new, maybe even a lunch item!"}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times and we were never disappointed. The waffle are fluffy and the omelettes are amazing. The portions are a good amount and I am always full when I leave.   Our server was Candice. She is super sweet and friendly. She is also great with children. She was quick to take our order and to bring our drinks. She checks on us often to see if we was ok. Amazing job. Thank you Candice."}
{"text":"Victoria was a great server! Super attentive and cheerful! She never let us run out of our beverages! The service was great and the food was even better. The chile rellano omelet was amazeballs. We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Carnitas huevos rancheros. Oh so good. And our server Natasha was fabulous. I love the concept that on busy days if you need anything,  all you do is flip the sign and the servers know you need help. Genius! Wish one was in my neighborhood. .."}
{"text":"What a great place for a large group!!! Ash H. Our waitress was awesome.. Chicken Fried Steak was killer!!! Habla Diabla potatoes!!!!! G.Y.S.O.T.!!! Service was exceptional, Ash was always on it with coffee and drinks!!!"}
{"text":"Never before had I ordered 'biscuits and gravy' -- until I spotted it on the Eggworks menu. When it arrived I thought maybe I'd made the wrong choice. The huge plate of biscuits and gravy was too huge and the pale gravy looked gross. How sorry would I have been if I didn't dig into those biscuits and gravy. That food was DELICIOUS! and I don't usually do gravy. Oh and I also had scrambled eggs. I've never not been able to eat an order of scrambled eggs before. But I couldn't eat what seemed to be a dozen scrambled eggs. They were perfectly scrambled and so beautifully textured -- not hard and dry but moist and solid. The Old Bay seasoned hash browns deliciously completed the trinity.  EW loses 1-star because of the non-dairy creamer."}
{"text":"Umm. Yeah. It was alright at best. Maybe I am just used to better food in Cali. I had an awesome waitress, though."}
{"text":"Deanna always helps me at the counter on Sundays. She's very quick and gives great service. She always makes sure everything is going well and keeps the coffee filled. Sadly she is a Denver Broncos fan, however that is better than being a Seahawks fan. Go sit at the counter and ask for her, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Every time we've been here we have had great service and we love our waitress Tamara."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a 5 star but my chicken cordon bleu skillet was somewhat dry.  I was expecting chunks of chicken (maybe I misread the description) but got slices chicken like the kind you get at a deli counter.  The potatoes were good, cheese wasn't bad, but I do feel it needed something else because it wasn't anything special.  My husband got the country benny and he said it was excellent, my daughter got one of their daily specials and she really enjoyed it.  The customer service was great, but since the place is rather busy it does take some time to get your food.  Still a great option for a breakfast, next time I'll try something else."}
{"text":"They open at 6am but today's paper is not available in the RJ machine.  So make an extra stop at the 7-Eleven to get your paper if you get there before 7am."}
{"text":"Just about every item on the menu is $10 bucks.  Since all the prices are about the same it makes it easy to pick what you like but by the time you add $2.90 for coffee you start to wonder if breakfast is worth that much.  Add the fact that your choice of potatoes is frozen tiny pieces which seasoning or a nearly exact replica of Mikey D's hash brown patties - yes frozen also.  After not being asked which on of these wonderful potato choices I preferred last visit , I decided it would be my last."}
{"text":"I always love the Chili Rellaño omelette. MIL likes the pumpkin pancakes and the Eggs Benedict is always yummy.   They never disappoint and are always worth the short wait.  Thanks Caitlan for the great service."}
{"text":"Hey Lisa C.  You were a very good server. We eat here all the time. One of our favorite breakfast joints. I don't think you are supposed to require 5 stars or solicit reviews. Yelp rules are created so your establishment can not skew the ratings. It is supposed to be spontaneous on the customers part.   I did participate because everything was 5 star today, but all credibility of ratings comes into question when you hold a contest."}
{"text":"This is the go to place for breakfast. Great food for great prices and they even have turkey selection for those of us that don't eat beef or pork"}
{"text":"Delicious the food was really good,  I'm sad it's so far away.  Our waiter was great he was quick and courteous. I got my free muffin using Yelp..  (yummy thanks)  Muffins were fresh.. if you're on the area stop by .. yum"}
{"text":"Sara was a great server!! Very informative of the menu, friendly with kids and she checked in on is regularly. Definitely loved having her as a server!!"}
{"text":"Really nice area even better restaurant. They put the egg in egg works. Service is fast friendly everything rocks with this place. Highly recommend it if you have the means."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time on Sunday 12/27 at the Henderson location and the service was phenomenal but this place is far from the service I received. I was at this location on Monday and the server Robert must have been having a bad day or simply was not in the mood to serve us. I'm a cheerful person and greeted this guy with a smile seriously happy with the service I had received in Henderson only to be disappointed by this Robert and his lack of courtesy.  We were not greeted but rather given a blank stare and rudely asked \"do you know what you want to order\" not welcoming at all. These type of people really upset me I mean how hard is it to give someone a smile and extend the same courtesy that's been given to you. This was my second visit to an Egg Works and will stay away from this location. I'm one that doesn't complain to management but rather one that values my money and simply does not return. I hope this review is considered as a coaching opportunity for this guy. The service I received was horrible. His negative demeanor and the unpleasant look on his face was disappointing he simply did not want to be there. Food and service do not go hand in hand. In my industry GREAT SERVICE is the key component in creating great dinning experiences. Bad service, no customers, no customer, no money. I will never compromise service over food it's all or nothing."}
{"text":"Veronica was our server, she was attentive, fast and friendly.   The banana nut muffins are homemade and taste amazing, you get a free one with your first check in. Redeem, redeem, redeem!  I came with a party of 4 on a Sunday. Brunch rush hour was ok. Only 20 minute wait. Estimated 30 mins, so that's a plus.   I had Michelada and the Haolo Moco. I my go to brunch dish is the Loco Moco, first time here and so I am open to try anything new. It's basically country (white) gravy. It was a nice change and overall tasted very good. Definitely recommend. The Michelada hat their house spices which gave it a nice kick. Size was decent, lasted the entire brunch. No additional order needed. Total with tip came out to $18-nod bad for the size brunch.  My party had the stuffed French toast, loco Moco and the works skillet. Everyone was happy. Coffee tastes ok and come with free refill. Mimosa come in a mix-your-own set. Personal bottle and cup of OG. You can decide how heavy or light you want it.   Will come back here again, hopefully with Veronica again."}
{"text":"Egg works is the best!!! Make sure you sit in Nikki's section, best waitress in the house :)!!"}
{"text":"We ventured off the Strip for a fabulous breakfat.Kathleen our server was superb, attentive and professional.  Servings were large but always like leftovers for locals. Crepe had guacamole turkey and other goodies.substituted real good fresh fruit instead of potatoes.  The banana muffin was warm and delicious came with meal  Hubby had blueberry pancakes, he loved them and he is\"picky\" about pancakes 2 stack would have been enough..nice experience would retun. Used groupon."}
{"text":"Good homemade food but perfect for hangovers or good quality food that doesn't cost an arm and an a leg. Servers are nice."}
{"text":"Portions are big and the wait staff is super friendly but the food was only okay for me and everything seemed to be really salty.  It's a little bit off the strip but it'll be sure to help that hangover.  There is a bit of a wait, but it's a pretty big location so you won't be waiting too long."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I also have to vouch for the great reviews on here!   As soon as I walked up to the door, I was greeted by a gentleman who opened the door for me.  Once inside I was greeted by a couples of friendly ladies in the front.  Talk about world class service!  I told her it was my first time here and she welcomed me and asked me where I would like to sit so I choose to sit in the booth area.  Marianne was my server and I must say she had the most friendliest vibe about her and so upbeat!  She was so nice and make sure I was taken care of.  She knew it was my birthday and gave me a complimentary warm banana nut muffin!  It was sooooo good!  I had the mashed potato omelette with turkey bacon that came with hash browns and toast which was recommended and let me tell you...DE-LI-CIOUS!  Def I recommend this too!  If you want great service and food, please go see them, you will not be disappointed!  Tip:  I bought a Groupon/Living Social voucher and it includes the alcoholic drinks as well!  I will def go back to them again when I'm back in the area again!"}
{"text":"Came here for late breakfast on a Sunday. We were seated right away. Manny was our server and he was awesome. Very friendly and attentive. Food came out in a timely manner and Manny checked in to make sure everything was good.   Great service and food. My favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"We had great service and great food! Candice was fantastic!  Very large variety of egg dishes. Very satisfying and fresh. Everything is made the scratch...even the hot sauces."}
{"text":"Have been here several times, One of the best breakfast places to eat in Vegas.  Service is great and be prepared to eat plenty of food! Its a very down home place.  Sherelle B."}
{"text":"Great breakfast hearty portions.  Nice way to end vegas trip. Wide variety on menu. Veggie omelet  HUGE and packed with veggied, couldn't eat half it was so big. Buttermilk pancakes  nice and fluffy we ordered 2 for the table to share.  Endless coffee a nice touch,  not greatest coffee but fresh.  Overall stellar food."}
{"text":"A breakfast place with no hashbrowns!?  Egg Works has awful frozen hashbrowns just like the gross ones from McDonalds that you cook in a toaster. Yuck!  And their little square potatoes are also frozen potato squares that they warm up and serve.  Yuck again. Fresh hashbrowns should be served at all breakfast places.  This place sucks."}
{"text":"A must! Hubby could not stop raving, and the moment we left he asked when's the next time were going! Great portions, great food, amazing service and even more amazing quality and price:) And endless house coffee!  *bonus: the decor and cleanliness is up to par and you even get to follow this adorable train that circles the restaurant. So cute!"}
{"text":"Not my choice for breakfast. Only reason I've come here is Amy C. likes this place for breakfast and being the good friend that I am, I oblige. I've been here and waited an obscene amount of time, and I've been here and seated right away. The menu isn't impressive. I swear it takes me longer to decide on what to eat than it does for them to prepare it. I've tried the Eggs Benedict and don't think anything of them. I am not a fan of breakfast potatoes, I prefer hash browns. That's a big negative on this place. I was craving banana walnut pancakes one time and I asked if they could make them, so I receive my pancakes with bananas and walnuts on top off the pancakes. What the heck? Shouldn't they be mixed in with the pancake batter? I know I had a perplexed look on my face and the waitress wasn't interested in asking me what the problem was.  I feel the food here is comparable to IHOP or Denny's, no quality. I also dislike that you have to go up to the counter to pay. Why can't I leave my check and the tip on the table and leave when I'm done! I can only hope I can talk Amy C. into Cracked Egg instead."}
{"text":"It's your typical breakfast joint. Potatoes were dry and nothing to write home about. Eggs were decent. Was not good value for the food. It's a fairly large restaurant and was quite empty at the time. Someone has gotta pay for the rent."}
{"text":"I eat at this location at least once a week. I sit at the counter and that has allowed me to become very friendly with the very outgoing and equally as friendly staff.  So besides a great and attentive staff, the menu has a huge selection of just about any which way you can order eggs. Then add in all the pancakes, burritos, burgers, pizza and it's insanely good, fresh and large portions. Their eggs works breakfast potatoes are awesome and I usually have to add ketchup to any type of potatoes except for theirs. All in all the food I've never had a dish I have not liked very much. If you don't like your dish they will replace it with anything else you do want and you will likely get a free muffin for your troubles. I also can't say enough about the laid back staff, great attitudes and very eager to help make you happy. That is a good enough reason for me to go at least once a week."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. Mother's Day, but it was so orderly. Wait was not horrible. Staff is friendly, helpful and warm. Our server, Nicole was perfect. I always enjoy gong to this location, usually on Sundays. It just makes my day. Thank You!"}
{"text":"This place rocks, I loved the baileys and joe!! Lol our server Candace was great..definitely will be coming back next time we come back to vegas"}
{"text":"We come to this place AT LEAST 3 times a month. Cassandra is super friendly and made sure my eggs were on point! The servers are always great and the food never disappoints. Lots of options, you could seriously try something new every time and not be bored. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Really large portion! Biscuits and gravy are very very good and the service is excellent"}
{"text":"The portions here huge so come and share with a friend! We think donna is a rockin great waitress. So friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"Perfect off the strip option! Great for families! Awesome menu choices! Otherwise delicious!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch and were so impressed with this restaurant. First, half our party wanted lunch and the other half wanted breakfast.  There was something for everyone. And everyone loved their food. But what really enhanced the experience was our awesome server Donna who was attentive, kind and nailed all our requests. (Think Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally for two of the 6 people). Great place! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The service and food was awesome. We love coming here for breakfast on Sunday! Thank you!"}
{"text":"OK folks, this is the essential breakfast joint...just look at the name!  Upon arrival, I could already tell this was the real deal Holyfield...it was packed with a good amount of people waiting.  I grabbed a seat at the counter, bypassing everybody (really dislike waiting in line for anything)    I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak, eggs over medium, seasoned potatoes, sourdough toast.  I would suggest the potatoes w/o seasoning ( a bit salty) the steak was good, texture, crispy, good gravy.  Add Lea n Perrins and we are ready to rock!  Service is good here overall, this is a busy place w/ a good system for order caller/plater and waitress/runners.    After all was conquered, the waitress tells me about the banana nut muffins.... she gave me one after the fact to try it.  I'm not a big sweets guy, but it waas good.  This place has something for everyone and stuff for other people....for the low star reviewers, I'd say they are the others... for the masses, this should be a 5-star place!    Til next time, good eating!"}
{"text":"We needed to get away from the strip and tourist traps. The Egg Place was on top of my Google search. It is well worth the short drive from the interstate. Large portions and great food, they didn't try to press potatoes on you, but gave you other options. Victoria was servicer and was excellent, I'll recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"The Egg Works is outstanding in every way. Food is   delicious, apmosphere is perfect and the service is second to none. Veronica is an excellent server and was so friendly...it made my wife and I feel so at home. Thank you for the great experience!!!"}
{"text":"This is our local go-to place for brunch on the weekends! The staff is always friendly and the food always delicious. There is occasionally a wait, but they move people quickly without ever feeling rushed at the end of our meal. We've been happy with all of the Egg Works and Egg & I locations for the 12+ years we've lived in the Vegas valley!"}
{"text":"So this is a location that I have eaten once before with no real issue, however this time I can't say the same. Our server was pleasant, though not enough to stand out as memorable. That wasn't the issue here, she did nothing wrong. This chain puts a spice on their home fried potatoes that to me makes them way too salty to eat. One time it was so bad that I had to send it back. When you order an item such as a skillet breakfast, they put these potatoes as the bed that the meals items lie on. In turn, the entire menu item tends to become incredibly salty. I tried it, and was rather shocked at the high salt/sodium level. I'm sure they would have been \"ok\" with us sending it back for this reason, but I'm surprised they don't get regular complaints about this. However, this was not even the main issue of our visit. They have an open (non screened,) \"pet friendly\" dine-in patio. We luckily chose to be seated inside the air conditioned restaurant. After we were seated, we noticed a fair amount of pigeons flying around on the patio. They were flying right by diners and even directly over where people were eating. They were flapping their wings, and making their presence known to all the diners that had the misfortune of eating out there. They were landing on the ground and eating food that had made its way to the floor. However, this wasn't even the worst part. A couple left quite a bit over on their plates upon their departure, and three or four of these birds landed on the table and began to chow down on the leftovers. They were standing on the plates (on the table) and really going to town. This continued for about 5 minutes or so, to our disgust. It wasn't until the hostess attempted to seat some more folks out there that they stopped, and they still didn't even fly away. They finally went to clean off the table, and the busser shoo'd them away. Not only was I disgusted, the words UNSANITARY and HEALTH HAZARD were flashing the color red in my head. Pigeons are not real clean members of the aviary family. It was so outlandish in my mind that I took to shooting pics & a video with my cell phone, I just couldn't believe it. I'm all for \"pet friendly\" environments, but this was just sickening to me that it was taken so nonchalantly and carefree. Like a scene out of the movie \"The Birds!\"  A true feeding frenzy! I was sick to my stomach at a distance, if I was unfortunate enough to be eating out there while this was taking place I would have undoubtedly walked out on my meal.  Other things I noticed while there included:  A. My plate was filled with 75% of fried potatoes. Obesity in America is real. I'm all for decent portions but this was seriously beyond a normal serving for one person.  B. The hot sauce on the table says \"refrigerate after opening.\" Do they replace the one on a table after its originally opened? I'm sure not.   C. Waiting to pay at the front, nobody present to take our (or another party's money.) We had to go looking for somebody to man the register.  I have little problem with patio dining normally, but this was a perfect example of how an inexpensive option like a screen would go a long way. To whom it may concern, please do this before somebody ends up sick. I also understand that they don't control said birds, but if this a regular occurrence then the appropriate individual should take notice immediately.  I have eaten in other locations and have had little to no issues, but I'm not sure if this type of thing has ever been experienced by others here before myself. I myself nor whom I was dining with will not be returning.  My visit still gets 3 stars only due to my server wasn't the issue and what I myself ate was fine.  P.S. If anybody needs proof I have pics and a video. I'm not vindictive or I would have posted a pic here today lol."}
{"text":"AWESOME SERVICE! Thanks ADRIENNE! I always look forward to my Tuesday meetings at Egg Works because I know the food and service is far greater than the 5 Stars rating!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Jennifer was excellent, she completely understood when I said I couldn't drink coffee without flavored creamer. \"That can change your whole morning!\""}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was a wonderful breakfast. In fact our server was so kind. I am on a special diet and needed a few substitute items and she was so helpful and I was able to have a great breakfast too! Next time we go I'll definitely be able to indulge !   Great place... Support our local businesses !"}
{"text":"Do you know what's good ALL THE TIME? Breakfast! There's never a wrong time for breakfast food. Well, like most breakfast places egg works is only open half the day. That's okay, atleast my friend and I got there 40 min before they closed.  I ordered the Crazy chicken omelet, well something like that. It was alright. It didn't  stand out and the taste didn't amaze me.  Do you know what was amazing though? They had banana bread French toast. I have never seen that at a restaurant! I was pretty excited when my friend said we should share one. If you come here, I definitely recommend it. I love that banana bread isn't that sweet, but very flavorful.  The service was also very friendly. You know how girls get when they get brunch, it's never ending talking. Even though we were almost the only people in the restaurant we didn't feel rushed when we ate and caught up."}
{"text":"Had the sunrise.. It was pretty good but too much cheese. Husband had the Mexican omelette and he said it was awesome, but again too much cheese. Overall they have great customer service :)"}
{"text":"Breakfast food is good and I should've stuck to that, but I went to breakfast without much of an appetite so I opted for their house salad and muffin. Is it so hard to get a fresh salad here in Henderson?  My lettuce was wilted, turning pink at the edges and had some brown spots. I asked them to take it back and the waitress kindly brought me more muffins on the house.   Why would an establishment ever serve salads that obviously are closer to rotting than being fresh.   Henderson, I give up on ordering salads from any of your restaurants. And Egg works, you're on my list of restaurants who rather plate any kind of food than plate quality ingredients and cross fingers that I'll just stuff my face without looking.   5 stars for the muffins though. I'll come back for those and when I'm hungry for breakfast food.   Skip the salad. Who eats that for breakfast anyways ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent service!! The wait time was only 7 min (not bad for a Sunday morning)  The place is welcoming and our server was friendly always with a smile on her face!  The food was delicious and they have HUGE portions! I ended up using a lot of their hot sauce on the eggs because they tasted a bit bland (hence 4 and not 5 stars) we ordered a veggie Omelette with avocado suggested by Donna our server! It was delicious a great choice!  I really liked the coffee  ( we had an entire batch all to ourselves."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. Good was very bland. We will not go back. Not sure how they won best breakfast in Vegas"}
{"text":"Delicious seasoned potatoes and I always do the steak and eggs.   My family also loves the Cincinnati Chili.   They get busy but they are great at getting waiting time expectation to you when you arrive."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the wide selection of breakfast dishes, the menu is diverse and includes many speciality foods. My new go to spot for breakfast. The service the last two times we've fined has been wonderful and friendly."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday afternoon.  It was packed but we were seated pretty quickly.  I should have gotten eggs.  I had the strawberry cream cheese french toast.  Strawberry cream cheese was weird.  Honestly, I will probably try a few other breakfast places before I come back here.  PS.  Lots of kids."}
{"text":"I've been to Vegas almost a dozen times now, and my favorite spot has always been Egg Works. It's quaint place with the most delicious omelettes are just to die for. Yes, I am willing to drive 10 minutes outside of the strip just to come to this place.  The portions are insane for the price they charge as well. My favorite part also is it really makes me happy to see the sun shining through the window while I eat breakfast, remembering the evening before. As you know, in Vegas - there is always something to remember the night before."}
{"text":"I got the works omelette. It was amazing  only 11.25 very worth it. Big portions. Donna was a very good server. She came by with muffins since it was our first time. They were delicious. She always made sure I had a drink kept and eye on us. Always smiling. Another person also came by and asked how was our food. Everyone is super nice and friendly. Thank you it's a good way to start the day."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Egg Works. My family come here often. The service is pretty fast considering how busy it is on weekends. I enjoy the breakfast items and there are many to choose from. I tried a burger once and decided to stick to breakfast. I really like the Sunrise mountain. Very big portions and all around breakfast."}
{"text":"Food was egg-celent and served quickly. Our server James was polite, helpful and his suggestions were great (biscuits n gravy & skillet breakfast w/comp banana muffins). We are only in town for a week but we will definitely come back before we head back home."}
{"text":"What a great place for breakfast. My husband and I had been here before but went to the one on sunset this one is a lot closer to home. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated right away. The service is impeccable they're always coming back to ask you if you need anything and check on you. The food is also amazing the eggs Benedict is very good and I highly recommend it if you like it. The pancakes and waffles also looked very good from what I could see people eating. Everything is fresh and gets to the table right away. They also have a great yelp coupon for a free banana nut muffin which is also very good. So if you're out and about looking for a place to have breakfast or lunch and you're hungry I highly recommend this place. But go hungry cause they definitely give you lots of food"}
{"text":"This is our go-to breakfast place and has been for over 2 years.  Excellent food, great specials, good prices, big portions, FANTASTIC service every time.  Yes, there is a wait on weekend mornings, but the place is big and turnover is quick.  Any wait is always worth it.  Seriously awesome food, and a great variety of options.  Big ups to PK, who knows that getting food out for the little ones (even just a side of toast) makes for a MUCH nicer meal for everyone!"}
{"text":"The best place to come for a delicious breakfast!! Every time I come to Vegas it's a must place to eat! Great service and even better food. Thanks for the great service Marc!"}
{"text":"Came for an early weekday breakfast since the buffet was not open yet and it was too late for the late night cafe specials. Cute train track that goes around the restaurant, the rest of the decor can use some updating. Some tables and chairs were recognizably uneven. The staff was nice and efficient, very accommodating. Food came quick. Sucks that the meals don't include bacon, so it cost almost $4 for 3 strips...boo!  So, didn't have bacon with breakfast.  I had the Island Favorite w/ Portuguese sausage (simple breakfast w/ rice and 2 over-easy eggs) and hubby had the Denver omelet (he said bell pepper pieces were cut way too big, not diced like he's used to); we ordered a short stack to share (ok, but much better at the cafe).  The food was fine, but not any more special than what we can get at the buffet or even at the cafes and the price is way more expensive here.  Felt ripped off, I guess I'm just used to either getting late night/early morning cafe deals or paying breakfast buffet prices and getting more for my money that way. I'd rate the food quantity and price at a 2, and the food quality at a 3. This should be a 2.5 star review, but upped it to 3 stars since our server actually did a great job...i think his name was Ethan, or something that started with an E...nice Hawaiian guy, may have been a manager. Glad I tried this place out, now I can cross them off my list - too bad they didn't make my repeat list though - we won't be back."}
{"text":"So I first came in here after taking a flight from Texas to Houston from Houston to Vegas with my two little ones I was exhausted and starving that could be why I enjoyed this so much. But I must say there food was good. I do not like any type of muffins or food with banana in it unless its just a plain banana on its own but their muffins were Delicious with a capital D!    I had the chicken fried steak breakfast plate was very yummy, love the potatoes they had some type of seasoning on them... I thought that they were so good. The portion sizes are huge. The kids portion sizes were huge as well my kids really enjoyed their pancakes. Great selection and a wide selection at that. Service was a little slow but very polite and they did apologize for that. Would like to try a few more things from the menu."}
{"text":"This place is still the best for breakfast.  Yum!  It is so delicious, eggs, bacon, coffee, potatoes \"Awesome\" and the banana muffin is to die for!    The staff is so cool, professional, food is always timely and served hot!  It is a must go, take your lover, friend, and or family.  Kids love the train that circles the eating area, how cool!"}
{"text":"Candice was rad! Very friendly and down to earth. Food was great. Had the bacon avocado omelet. Make sure to check in to get the free banana nut muffin."}
{"text":"Alexa did a great job! She was very attentive and made our experience an enjoyable one. We will be returning soon"}
{"text":"Great place with amazing food...the other location near the strip was closed due to construction, so I headed out to this location which was a good choice. Blade was an amazing server and always had a smile. I sat at the counter so I got to take a look at the staff running around who were all on it. I'd go again."}
{"text":"I had the country fried steak this morning. It's served in a skillet over a bed of overly salty breakfast potatoes covered in sausage gravy and 2 eggs. The country fried steak was a bit on the chewy side... it wasn't horrible... just the saltiness of the potatoes overpowered the dish. We also got a side muffin which was firm but moist and a pitcher of coffee. The coffee itself is nothing amazing  but having the pitcher on the table for my own warm ups was cool"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  Love this place!  Our server, ALEX was awesome as always!"}
{"text":"We had a groupon for this place and wanted to try it while in Vegas. Went to the one on Sunset. Our waitress, Dolly was awesome and helped us with the menu. The food was excellent. Way more than we could eat. Wish we had one of these back home! Thank you Dolly for the great service. :-)"}
{"text":"How this place has less than 5 stars is beyond me. Anyone leaving Las Vegas or the Henderson area should make it a point to go out of their way to stop here. The stuffed French toast, eggs Benedict, or anything else you can think of will be top notch. Not only is the food absolutely delicious, but the service is nothing short of amazing. I will be dropping here on my way out of town every single time I am close enough."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. The food is always amazing, and when family visits this is the first breakfast stop. The service is always friendly too, and today was no different. This morning our waitress was Veronica, and she was so friendly and adorable. She was very attentive, and never lost that smile, even with my complicated breakfast substitutes. When service is good, the food tastes even better! :)"}
{"text":"First timeshare. You get a delicious muffin for free on your first visit. Dog friendly patio is a big plus for us. They have water bowls for them as well. Food and service were great. I had the Sundance breakfast omelet. Wow...loved the feta topping."}
{"text":"Great food, fair prices, and friendly service. Carla was attentive and made sure we were happy the whole dining experience. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Are server Brigette is the best! Friendly service with a smile. This is one of the best breakfast spots in Vegas. My personal favorite is the Country Benni. Always a treat to eat here!"}
{"text":"Ima going to have to say this place beat, my favorite breakfast restaurant in town, hands down great food, great vibe and great service. Also wanted to thank Austin for his service today you made us feel comfortable and you were very friendly."}
{"text":"Chris was awesome! We had never been here, and were a little distracted at the menu. He was very helpful and had great advice. He checked in on us constantly. Also the food was really good and the price was unbeatable!"}
{"text":"I see why everyone loves this place. The food is  outstanding. The service is stellar and the banananut muffins, OMG, those muffins. Plus they keep everything clean and that's a definite plus. Love this place, will be back."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place gets so many stars? This is our second time trying this place and if I had remembered eating the hash browns at another location I would not have come back. Does no one know what an over medium egg is? It is not runny! Back to the hash browns you can get the same thing at McDonald's, and the other potato thing they have isn't much better. Pancakes were tough and oddly a bit crispy? The sausage gravy, the sausage  isn't like any sausage I have tasted. Again not sure why the rating."}
{"text":"Really good find. We got a groupon deal. It's a little bit away from all the action, but we were headed hom already. Excellent food and customer service. Would definitely recommend even without groupon deal."}
{"text":"came here after reading a reviw in the lvrj about their good chili burger.  i'm not a chili burger fan but i do like cincinnati chili coney dogs.  the menu says it's served on a \"fresh, steamed\" bun.  the kitchen must have missed that description because my bun was cold and hard.  the chili was ok but just missed the mark a little.  they do load to dog up with a heap of shredded cheese but the cold cheese cooled down the dog a little too much.  also, it's a mixture of several cheeses (i prefer only cheddar on my chili dogs).  i also ordered a side of fries.  they only offer seasoned fries (which i'm not a fan of).  i ate them but wished for just some plain ol french fries.  i sat at the counter so service was quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Went to eat there today and had Christopher as our server.  He was very nice and attentive.  The food runner delivered the food and asked if we needed some Chlula or hot sauce for the meals.  My father wanted Chlula and asked for it.  She never returned.  Then half way thru the meal, our server returns with the check.  I really hate this.  I feel rushed and unwanted as a guest.  I also wanted to add a muffin to take home, but clearly he was done with us.  I love the food and most of the service.  Really, the check bring,  kills me.  If they need to go to break, fine, but he did not."}
{"text":"Good breakfast but I think tables need to be a little bigger since foods are served in big plates .. But Keep it up !!"}
{"text":"Drove about 20 minutes away from the strip to come try breakfast here because it has great reviews. Everything was absolutely delicious and the omelet that we had was incredible.  the pancakes were delicious.  service was great our server  Char took great care of us. Everyone was friendly too."}
{"text":"There was the best vibes in this restaurant as I walked in. There was a nice morning buzz is people chatting, laughing, and the sound of clinking silverware. It was what the expected in places like breakfast joints. This location is seemingly better in popularity than the one on Sunset, and I've heard that the one on sunset road has more grease, and does not look/deem too tasty to others.  I was with my friends and we had Blade serve us--she was great! Really chill and laid back, but willing to always be alert to everything and anything that we needed. She was courteous, and made sure our orders were all placed and correctly written down.  Our food took a maximum of only about ten to fifteen minutes to come out."}
{"text":"Getting the waffle works- strawberry cream cheese stuffed French toast- plain pancakes- cheesy cheese omelet & regular French toast...the family's order! Everything tasted amazing! Great service too!"}
{"text":"Food to make a local boy from Hawaii feel at home. Got the Hawaiian Local favorite two eggs, two scoop rice, Portuguese sausage and a banana walnut muffin. Woo boy! Happy as can be. Great service, all wait staff attentive and happy to accommodate you. What's not to love? Just get there early on weekends to beat the rush.  I'll definitely be back when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"It was a great experience all around. The service was great our waiter was fantastic!!! The service was quick and the food was delicious. I got the Apple cinnamon pancakes, I don't always order pancakes because they aren't my favorite, but these were fantastic! My son was excited because they have eggs, spam and rice - we are from Hawaii so he was missing his staple food!! The best part Aloha shoyu!!! Overall great experience!!"}
{"text":"I've only been to this specific location once since it's right near my house. I woke up abnormally early today so my fiancé and I decided to have some breakfast.   We both work in the restaurant industry and know how high volume places can get so we are usually very patient with people when we go out in public lol.   Anyways...to keep it short we were sat fairly fast for how busy it was and greeted right away. Candice was our server and she was very pleasant and positive. She did say that she had just gotten there and yet I saw her get double sat and pick up tables outside of her section. You go girl! Our food came out fast and the manager re filled our drinks. I'd say it was only about 30 minutes we were there- the average breakfast time. But Candice made sure to say good bye to us and have a wonderful day. She was awesome. Thanks Candice- we'll be back!"}
{"text":"So much food to choose.. the service is great starting with the young girl that sits you down to your waitress... amazing.. the food was spectacular the banana nut muffin spectacular there is so much food to choose from and we only got like two or three things but can't wait to go back because the food is so awesome..First time here but definitely not the last. Susan L."}
{"text":"I love breakfast, and this is the Platonic ideal of a breakfast restaurant.   They have all the key categories - eggs (obviously), pancakes, French toast, etc. The egg menu really shines. Most diner/breakfast places, even when great, have all the basics, but this place has about 80 variations on eggs. Scrambles, hashes, and more - they even have 8 different kinds of poached eggs.  I had the Smokey Chipotle Pork Benny, and both the pork and sauce were outstanding. They also bring you a free banana nut muffin with Yelp check in. I wasn't expecting much, but it was so well made, and it came out hot.   This is very close to the airport, so it's a great stop on the way in or out of Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing!!!!! Our waitress Jaszmin was awesome! The banana nut muffin tasted like cake! I got the fiesta skillet with chorizo! My husband got the stuffed French toast! Def recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing,  but our Server Jason was phenomenal..... best service we've had in all of Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and going to Eggworks makes it perfect. Love the menu and the service. Tables are spaced out nicely and outside dining is available. Conveniently situated right off the freeway. New & clean location."}
{"text":"Services here was outstanding Christopher was our server...kids game is top notch...free muffin sir...hell yeah! Good coffee, had the Loco Moco...it was excellent...zero wait time and they were slammed! Did i mention Christopher was a rock star for a server? Yeah he killed it Thanks!"}
{"text":"The service at this place is by far the worst service we've every received in this service industry town.  Here's what we love: The food is great. The portions are very fair for what you pay. And that's why we've eaten there 4 times...... but.... here comes the bad....  Here's what we hate: The location stinks for parking (remember to bring your walking shoes!). The stupid black/yellow egg thing is a cop-out excuse for lazy servers (flip it if you need anything - Here's my first 'why are we tipping you?'). If you like more than one drink, forget about ever getting that refill. It ain't comin. Actually, when you order a diet coke, expect that not to come either (\"oops, I forgot\" - Seriously breakfast ain't that hard, honey). You might as well forget your food too. Your dining partner may get theirs, but you'll have to wait 10 more minutes for yours without any type of acknowledgement; I suspect its normal because of the lack of reaction. The hostess' 2 out of our 4 visits acted as server assistants. The other 2, other servers brought our food. (Why are we tipping you, our server, when everyone else does your work?).  The cash register and hostess stand situation can make even the most non-claustrophobic person want to scream out 'stop touching me!' Crowded is an understatement.  The last time we were in the server ignored us the entire meal, never said a word to us (with the exception of 'what can I get for you?' to take our order), but as she dropped the check tried to start some half-hearted dialogue about 'our plans for the rest of the day' (woman, I don't know you. And after ignoring us, this isn't going to save your tip).  We'd love to talk to a manager..... but one never seems to hold any presence on the floor. (Is there even one?)"}
{"text":"CRACK POTATOES!  So I was beyond excited to find that an Egg Works was going up near my house. I have frequented the other locations around town and have been a fan of the crack potatoes for quite some time. This location is perfect. It's got a couple of fireplaces and is much more cozy (in my opinion) than the other locations. Side note: this place was supposed to be the location of the Italian restaurant chain Carinos but apparently it failed to open. Thus, the building is brick on the outside and looks much different than the other locations.   That being said, the food is delicious and consistent with other locations. I always order the Sausage patty, egg, crack potatoes and toast or banana muffin (depends on how I feel that day). The hubby always orders a skillet which is always way too much food. The service here is stupendous and everyone is very accommodating. The coffee is top-notch!"}
{"text":"Yummy yum yum! Great for breakfast and their fries for lunch are delicious. Love the coffee too. The potatoes here are very addicting. My hubby and I have to restrict ourselves or we find ourselves coming here quite a bit. Not for those on diets."}
{"text":"I tried this location for the first time earlier this week and I was very pleased.  The restaurant is a large space and I found myself sitting at the counter in the back of the rooms.  I like counter seating for breakfast because you have the chance to watch the staff do their things and you have a glimpse into the kitchen.  After looking over the extensive menu, I opted for the Sundance Special, a vegetarian omelette made with mushrooms, spinach, artichoke, with Swiss cheese folded in all in a 4 egg omelette.  It was topped by diced fresh tomatoes and feta cheese.  I had my choice of potato but I opted for some sliced tomatoes instead.  Instead of toast, I got the banana nut muffin.  Breakfast was very good and it was also a lot to eat.  Service was outstanding.  There was only one other person at the counter.  Your coffee is poured for you the first time and they leave a thermos of coffee for you.  It was great because I could drink as quickly as I wanted and refill without waiting.  The staff was very pleasant and I left with a good impression of this new place."}
{"text":"Can't believe I forgot to leave a review at this place. First off if you're visiting Vegas and want a good breakfast come here.  There is all the traditional breakfast plus other specialty items; all at great prices. They also have 30 percent miltary discount!!!! I always come here while in Vega, trust me you don't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"I stopped in this place for breakfast on my last morning in Las Vegas during this particular visit and ordered their ciabatta breakfast sandwich with bacon, your choice of cheese, and with a side of house breakfast potatoes. I asked for my eggs to be prepared medium, but unfortunately they arrived runny. The yolks were running out of my eggs before I even took my first bite.  The ciabatta bread was good and came nice and warm. It was moist with a bit of a chew and slight crust. The two fried eggs, like I said, were under cooked for my taste and under seasoned as well. I added some black pepper, but I only ate one half because I could not get over the runny yolk. The bacon was pretty good. It had good flavor and was well cooked. I took it out of the second half of the sandwich I did not eat and ate it. You can choose bacon, turkey bacon, or sausage for the sandwich. In addition to under cooked yolk, the sandwich was very basic and needed something to spruce it up, perhaps a sauce or sliced avocados would suffice.  The potatoes were little rectangular prism and were fried well to a golden brown. They were seasoned well enough and with a red pepper spice here and there. The tasted pretty good. Service was good and quite friendly and enthusiastic."}
{"text":"Wow! Great food and AMAZING customer service. We decided to try this spot instead of the usual Sunrise Cafe. Went in sat at the bar, order our coffee. Right away we could tell the servers are on point! We had Ashley who was dealing with a customer that kept sending back his steak because it wasn't cooked right. But she handled this so smoothly and with such great service! I have been in the service industry for 10+ years and she was very impressive with her skills.   I had the veggie Benny! Oh good lord! Amazing hollandaise sauce. Veggies were fresh and fruit as a side dish was on point.  My bf had an omelet with veggies which was awesome as well.    We def will be coming back here! Thank you Ashley for being awesome!"}
{"text":"The food is really good here and they give you a large portion. Every time I come here I can never finish my meal. They have an outside patio if you'd like to eat outside.. that is also dog friendly."}
{"text":"I'm here at least once a week. This location is a little crowded and hard to get to and sometimes the wait can be a bit long, but it's all well worth it. Great American breakfast food. The portions are generous, seasoned potatoes are great, and the banana nut muffins are warm, sticky, and one of a kind. Our server, Tina, had an extensive knowledge of the menu and very friend. Highly recommend any of these locations around town for a fantastic brunch."}
{"text":"The food was okay. The prime rib benny satisfied my appetite, but it was too salty. The strawberry cream cheese french toast gave me a sugar coma. It was really tasty, but super sweet. Way too much strawberry syrup, but the cream cheese was pretty good. They give you a free banana nut muffin with a check in, so that's pretty neat. I kept asking for water with lemon, but the three times I asked for a refill, she kept forgetting my lemon. Sheesh, when life gives you lemons, right? Anyways, it was okay. Service was alright, nothing too special. I would come back here to try the other stuff."}
{"text":"Wanted to say what a good server Manny is.  We were sitting waiting and no one even took our drink order.  Manny was not even our server, but he saw is waiting and came over and took our order and made sure it was out in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"This was a great experience, one of the best breakfasts places in las vegas. Great service and great food. Our server was veronica and she was very nice and got the food and check out fast and efficient."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and I must say that they definitely exceeded my expectations. I ordered the Greyhound for my beverage. I'd never had it before but I enjoyed it. For my meal I got the Fresh Veggie Skillet Breakfast. Those Hablo Diablo potatoes are amazing! I think I ate a few off of my friends plate as well lol. Whenever I'm in the mood for breakfast again I'll have to pay them another visit. Bottom line, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yah!  My fellow yelpers come through again!  Decided to take my friends here for breakfast based on the reviews.  The place was already packed at 9 am, luckily we only had to wait for about 10 minutes.  The servers were nice enough to bring my friends a cup of coffee while we were waiting.    The menu has all the standard breakfast items: omelets, skillets, pancakes, waffles, french toast, etc.  Then there are also sandwiches, salads, crepes, and even a special \"Cincinnati Chili\".  The portions are hefty and the quality is excellent.  The breakfast potatoes, for example, are crispy outside, soft and moist inside.  They are not soggy with shortening.  Needless to say, everyone left with a full stomach and in a good mood.    If I am ever coming home from an all night bender and in the mood for a western style breakfast, EggWorks is tops on the list!"}
{"text":"As always the food is good I love the breakfast but you really don't get bang for the buck the amount they now serve is not worth the cost as the food is good not amazing like it used to be"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here meeting my sister that I hadn't seen in years... Was a little worried at first with it being so busy ... Let's just say the wait was well worth it... The service by Donna the best ever and the whole entire staff was quick and listened to our needs thank you so much for making our breakfast experience amazing"}
{"text":"Jennifer did a fabulous job when we went in with a party of 11. Thanks so much for your hospitality and attentiveness!"}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service! Food was delicious. The place is absolutely adorable."}
{"text":"I've seen this Place a million times. I had a class today and I got there early so I stopped in here. All I had was coffee and bacon. They bring you a carafe of coffee which is awesome and the bacon was cooked perfect. The staff was really nice and  attentive. I'm glad I stopped in here."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Our server Caitlin was amazing!!  We will be back.  I always get the Loco Moco, it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (29 of 365). I have a lot of catching up to do!  1 star = for the much larger establishment to account for all the waiting at the other Egg work establishments.  I am much happier at this location because the wait is not as long as other locations and no more than 30 minutes from what I have experienced so far.  2 stars = wait staff.  They are always accomodating even for large groups.  They are always super friendly, courteous, and quick to answer to your egg of problems once you change your egg sign from happy to sad on your table.  It amazes me how they see it so quickly.  3 stars = food.  They have a wide selection of breakfast and brunch items.  A couple of my favorites are the California Crepe, the Chicken Fried Steak, and the entire Aloha menu; especially the sausage.  Yum!  I always have a good experience for breakfast here and always leave fulfilled.  4 stars = for their hazelnut coffee and banana nut muffin; when paired together with butter of course, it's breakfast in heaven.  Sometimes I get full from just this muffin.  An entree to share w/ a friend would suffice if you have this to start.  5 stars = because they have a new schedule and are open past 3pm to serve brunch all day to 8pm! Yaye!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate breakfast here Thursday. What a wonderful experience we had, too. Were seated immediately and I had coffee and she ordered a Diet Coke. Split their special of the day which was a chili rellano omelet which we opted for the deviously seasoned potatoes and super moist banana muffin. Huge portions, we split and still left food. Looking forward to future visits not only to your city but this delightful breakfast resturant."}
{"text":"I love breakfast and I love Egg works! Every time I come to Vegas I make sure to swing by this gem. If you love breakfast than I guarantee you will love this place. Not only is the food excellent the service is great, especially Nicole! She is so friendly and so quick I make sure to request her whenever I go in!"}
{"text":"Great place for a hearty breakfast!  3 1/2 stars...nearly a 4!  This Egg Works is in the middle of blink-at-the-roundabout and you'll miss it part of Summerlin!  It's like a needle in a haystack!  But finding this popular breakfast locale was worth it!  Came here with the fam on a Sunday of all days and even in the upper boonies the place was crowded.  Like super crowded!  But thankfully even though many of us had to wait outside, it didn't take Egg Works more than 15 minutes to seat us.  And we got a lovely table on the outside Richie Rich Summerlin air!  Ahhhhhh....breathe in the wealth!  And the occasional fumes of Ferrari's passing by.  It's easy to see why this Egg Works is so busy.  It's basically the only one in this part of town.  Plus it caters heavily to the breakfast/brunch crowd.  Plus, apparently folks actually like the food!  It's got a lot going for it.  Upon being seated we were promptly helped by the wait staff.  Our order:  ME -Original Breakfast Burrito ($9.95) - Flour tortilla stuffed with 4 eggs, diced bacon, bell peppers, Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes, cheddar & jack cheese.  Waiter also suggested I add avocado in my burrito (a $2.50 upcharge!!).  Comes with a side of more Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes & Habla Diablo salsa.  WIFEY -Santa Cruz Skillet ($10.99) - bottoms layer of Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes, topped with seasoned chicken breast, chorizo, green chilies, onions, and home made Santa Cruz sauce (whatever it really is I don't know).  Topped with a dollop of sour cream, melted cheese & 2 eggs over easy.  Also comes with your choice of toast of banana nut muffin (she chose muffin).  KID -Waffle Works ($9.80) - waffle served with 2 eggs any style (over easy), with choice of ham, bacon, or sausage.  Plus with check in on Yelp we got a complimentary banana nut muffin to try!  Food was good but it did take a bit of extra time to come out possibly because we were either on the outside patio or because it was just slammed at Egg Works that day.    My breakfast burrito was definitely hearty, it was huge with the addition of that expensive avocado!  I was only able to eat half, I had to take the other half home for later.  Flavors in the burrito were yummy, fresh scrambled eggs, good quality bacon bits, fresh veggies, spicy potatoes, and more than enough cheese throughout.  Topped with some of their Habla Diablo salsa & house hot sauces this breakfast burrito was pretty top notch!  The side of extra Habla Diablo potatoes are really tasty, seasoned with a nice kick & cooked crunchy on the outside but still fluffy on the inside.    Wifey liked her Santa Cruz skillet very much.  Chicken was grilled but not dry, chorizo & that Santa Cruz sauce gave the dish some extra flavor and a punch of heat.  All that with egg yolk running down?  Oh yeah, yum city baby!    Kid thought the Waffle Works plate was OK.  It really wasn't anything special to write home about, pretty par for the course.  The waffle was a bit cold, and tasted like a basic waffle to her.  It was just alright, but they forgot butter!  So her first bite or 2 were dry.  Bacon & eggs weren't anything special, just bacon & eggs.  We were a bit disappointed with our banana nut muffins though.  I thought they would be brought warm to our table but they were cold.  They could have used a pat of butter as well since they were on the dry side.  So the muffin was somewhat forgettable.  One thing that may bother the value-conscious is the prices here at Egg Works.  For breakfast they be on the high side!  To get a decent meal will cost you near $10 per not including any drinks.  And if you upgrade your burrito like I did with avocado, it will set you back over  $12 not including tax!  But keep an eye out on Groupon, they do promotions for this place often.  With the varied menu at the Egg Works we'll probably be back again.  They do Hawaiian type food here too, get a Loco Moco or some SPAM & Portuguese sausage for breakfast!  We'll be back!  If we don't get lost in a roundabout first."}
{"text":"I went here on my 1 hour lunch and had plenty of time. Char was our server and she was awesome! I have been here in the past and have always left so stuffed! Char let me know that I could order a 2 egg omelette instead of the regular 4 egg. I was able to get the perfect size lunch. Everyone working was friendly and attentive to all of their customers. I will definitely be back soon. Thank you Char for your exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 9:00 on a Friday morning.  No wait at all.  I was surprised it wasn't busier...  Egg works offers a large slightly overwhelming newspaper style menu.  The service was super friendly, fast, and smiley.  We had three breakfasts and three coffees for $36.  Price is right.  Momma was thrilled with her eggs benny with spinach.  She opted for fruit on the side and was all but licking the perfectly cooked egg yolks out of the bottom of her dish.  She was also happy the fruit wasn't the usual melon cop out but fresh pineapple and orange slices.  I could not resist the temptation of the chicken enchilada omelette.  Theis creative breakfast omelette weighed approximately 4 lbs. and was served with at least 3 servings of crispy seasoned potatoes.  The portion was huge! I brought half home.  The omelette had chicken, green chiles, enchilada sauce, and cheese, and crispy tortillas baked on top for a crunchy surprise.  Very good.  Nothing needed salt or pepper.   Hot, yummy, and nicely seasoned.    The leave a carafe of coffee on the table for your convenience and provide french vanilla coffee creamer. BONUS POINTS!  The decor is super cute; not too kitchy.  Little egg details everywhere and an outhouse style bathroom door.     I'll go back for sure when I'm ready for another super sized breakfast."}
{"text":"Today was our first trip to Egg Works, and we went to the location on Rainbow.  I can't say how great this place was and how impressed we were with the service.  Our server, Amy, was enthusiastic, on top of things for our party of four and was great at recommending options.  Typically at places like this that serve cafe style breakfast I usually get a basic breakfast burrito, but in this instance Amy recommended the Santa Cruz Burrito.  The burrito had eggs, chicken, chorizo, cheese, green chile and was topped with a homemade \"Santa Cruz sauce\" which Amy described as a \"eggs Benedict style sauce with a Spanish twist\" and that's exactly what it was.  The burrito was sided with a bit of sour cream as well as potatoes and I finished every bite and was not disappointed at all. In fact, this was one of the best burritos I have had for breakfast and that's saying a lot considering I was previously a thirty year Southern California resident.    Their prices are more than fair here, and another great touch is they have these little hanging wooden eggs on the table, one with a smiley face and one with a sad face. If you need service, flip the egg to the sad face and one of the staff will come over, basically eliminating the long waits for a server to bring you something that typically plagues most restaurants.  On a final note, we decided to stop by and see manager Maggie before leaving to let her know what a fantastic and above the norm job Amy did, and she was very pleasant and glad to hear about her workers great job. If you're in town, stop in and ask for Amy!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  Went with a party of 12 they sat us and was able to take the orders and serve us quickly.  If something wasn't  right, we 'flipped' our Table Egg to YELLOW and any and all staff came to address what we needed.  The food was fabulous and huge quantities."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Our server, Veronica was great! She made sure we were taken care of even thought she was running around with other tables. Our food came out right away and everyone in our table loved their food!!! Great place, if you are in Vegas visit Egg Works!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, tons of items to choose from , you can find something for everyone , get there early or later in day because they get very busy , but again great food"}
{"text":"We were recommended this place by our hotel. The food was ok, not actually good. The highlight was definitely our server Christian who was great. He explained everything well. Got our order down with no problems and was very attentive, the service as a whole is very good here. I ordered the corn beef hash and the mashed potatoe omelette. Both were marginal at best however the fresh muffins were awesome."}
{"text":"The cons: I really can't be sure how the food tastes because all of it tastes like seasoning salt. They cooked everything with seasoning salt andthen doused everything with seasoning salt, including the potatoes and hollandaise sauce, once it's on the plates.  I thought it was just my food but I looked at other people's plates around me and they had the same thing going on.  This place uses a ton of seasoning salt so I do not recommend you eat here if you have an intolerance for salt, or if you have already met your salt intake limit for the next 3 months. Also, I ordered the blackened prime rib.  It is not a blackened slice of prime rib.  It is chopped up leftover meat that is completely saturated in... you guessed right! Seasoning salt.  There were definitely some good things and I give one star for each of them: the atmosphere was very upbeat and fun. The place is clean and the decorations are appealing.  The staff was super awesome, too. Very friendly, attentive and fast.  I hope the next time I'm in Vegas I will have time to give This place a second chance on the food. But next time around, I will be sure to ask for 'no salt'."}
{"text":"\"This was our first visit here and the Excellent service by Marian was awesome!  the food was really fresh and good! We went on a Saturday about noon and got seated right away. They were moderately busy. I had the biscuits and gravy with the seasoned potatoes and it was very very good. My wife had the buffalo chicken wrap  with Cajun fries and it also delicious. We will be back to try some other menu items. I recommend egg works it's a good place to eat. Just remember they close at 3pm!"}
{"text":"Want good Food ? .... Eat Here  Want great Service ....Go Here.  Ask to be seated in MELISSA section .  Don't want to wait in Line ....wake up earlier =)   The fast food line is just as long next door ."}
{"text":"Out servers name was Ashley and she was great. My mom has food allergies and Ashley was super accommodating about it.  The food arrived quickly and was exactly how it was ordered. It's hard to find places that my mom can eat and that are even nice about it.  We will be back for sure... Probably a lot now lol"}
{"text":"Any place that leaves a pot of coffee with me, I'll call a good place. I really enjoy their selection of foods. I'm a huge breakfast nut and they have pretty much everything I could want. I wish there were a few more vegetarian options but otherwise they are great. I think the servers can get a bit over loaded with how busy this place can get, but that doesn't stop it from being a good choice."}
{"text":"Rob is an exceptional server!   Provides the perfect touch of service, personality and professionalism. Food is always good and very consistent."}
{"text":"Had biscuits and gravy with two sunny eggs, hash browns and some turkey bacon. This isn't some regular place I would dine in regularly, I enjoy every time I come and eat in.   The food is just the right amount of hearty for me, always satisfied when leaving. Food is always great when I come."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is great for breakfast. Cool choo choo train runs around the ceiling. The waitress was very personable and friendly. The sun dance omelette has artichokes, tomatoes and cheese. The Sundance omelette is a great option since I am laying off the meat. The free banana nut muffin (yelp coupon) was delicious. I need to bring my family back here because my kids will enjoy the choo choo train."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about, strip mall breakfast food. Average price, nice people. Lot of omelettes on menu, big on high carb side dishes and big cake like breakfast rolls."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have breakfast and it is a sit down restaurant in which the customer can eat out side on a nice patio shaded from the sun or in the inside at nice tables. If you like eggs this is the place to be their scrambled egg taste just like mom used to make on weekends for us kids. Sometimes the servers seem that they don't want to be there but work is work."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, just a little too crowded for me. The food was good, I got the chicken enchilada omelette. I would try something else next time."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed breakfast with Nana & Papa at Egg Works Anthem. The food was prepared to our satisfaction and our server, Reina, was courteous, accommodating and ensured that our meal was served with a smile. Thanks Reina for helping us start our morning with a smile."}
{"text":"The Veggie Benny is my favorite dish. But, I have tried at least 10 different dishes: crepes, scrambles, loco moco, huevos rancheros, etc. They are always busy but it's worth the wait. The staff is friendly and my family will continue to go for breakfast in the future."}
{"text":"The hostess, and the server that came to help her, were incredibly rude and kept interrupting every person that tried to tell them their names/how many. They didn't take our name down, told us it would be a 'few minutes' while they shuffled us to the side. They proceeded to sit 3 different 3 and 4 tops in front of the 3 of us. After waiting for almost 20 minutes, we walked out.  I totally understand how breakfast/brunch places get swamped, but holy cow was that a frustrating experience and we didn't even make it to the food."}
{"text":"I'm not one for eating breakfast foods, BUT the food at this place is a wonderful exception. Not only is the food delicious and good priced, the service was amazing from our friendly server Heather.   I totally recommend this place to everyone and anyone wanting to eat breakfast. Today i had the crazy chicken omelette and their signature potatoes. The crazy chicken omelette has chicken, avocado, mushrooms and cheese. It's delicious for us non-pork eating people.   The service here is very efficient as well. Seating is quick and service is even quicker. When you're finished eating, you simply pay at the cashier located in the front, thereby freeing up tables quicker for others to sit."}
{"text":"It was ok. I ordered the spinach benny and it was nothing special. The ham had such a strange taste that I'm almost positive it's canned. The service was pretty mediocre too. It felt like we were being rushed. Our waitress never even made eye contact with us and she brought out our check before asking if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"We have officially lived in Las Vegas for a year.  How have we never been to Egg Works before now??  We literally live right down the street and we drive by this location almost every single day. I'm honestly ashamed of myself.  Now I have seen this place on a weekend and it is crazy packed! But, being a Tuesday mid morning we were seated right away and it had a decent flow of customers.  Maya (our wonderful server) came and greeted us right away. One of the things that stood out to me the most about our entire experience is that everyone working there seemed genuinely happy to be at work. Everyone was bubbly and all smiles and it definitely made for a great dining experience!  The hubby ordered the Chile Relleno Omelet and I had what I would describe as being their personal take on Biscuits and Gravy.  Everything was delicious! We especially loved their potatoes, they had a wonderful seasoning with a light kick!  Another major bonus is when you check in on yelp you get a free Banana Nut Muffin! So moist and tasty!!"}
{"text":"Great food with a lot of options i had the chili rellano omelette it was very good plus bloody marys where on point"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat  Great service from PK. I had the,vegetables omelet.  Supper dish and I ate it all ."}
{"text":"It was a long time before we were seated. I get better plated food from Denny's. And a better value at Denny's or ihop. The hash browns tasted like it had some sort of chemical in it. It was absolutely awful. I will never return."}
{"text":"Wow absolutely the one of the top worst food I have ever had. My hashbrowns tasted like chemicals! Horrible environment. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great service! I will definitely be back with my family! The wait is reasonable and the qualify of food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend really loves this place. Like, he craves it all the time. I am a fan, and I really, really, really love the banana muffin. The people are always friendly, and they do get very busy, due to their reasonable prices, good location, and good (and generously sized) food.   I normally get a Hawaiian style breakfast: Portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice. Sometimes I get the avocado and bacon omelette. I also had the crepe once. They are all good, and like I said, the prices and portions are good.   So why minus one star? For me, it's not something I crave that often, and I have been to better breakfast places. I would definitely recommend them, but I can think of at least two places (off the top of my head) that do breakfast better."}
{"text":"This was the best breakfast I have had in a restaurant in years! My chili relleno omelette was the best Mexican breakfast I've had outside of Mexico! The day before this we spent $50 on breakfast for two people at the Aria Cafe and had one of the worst dining experiences I have ever, ever had in my life. We paid under $20 for our breakfast at Egg Works and we're practically licking the plates! My boyfriends corned beef hash was really great and the house made banana nut muffins were amazing. Best breakfast I have found in Vegas and so cost efficient and family friendly. Link to my blog I wrote about our great expierence there.  http://hungrymountaineer.com/2015/08/chili-relleno-omelet-ole.html"}
{"text":"Really a fun place to come and get a full blown breakfast or even just a breakfast sandwich. I got a bacon, egg and cheese on a ciabatta and it was perfect! Plus if you use Yelp you get a free muffin!   Great and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's hard not to be a fan of Egg Works.  What you get here is pretty much what you get at the Egg and I (their other breakfast joint), Cracked Egg, and if you're in SoCal, Broken Yolk.  Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and when it comes this meal, I tend to keep it simple...just an omelet and some carbs. On my most recent visit, I had brunch with a couple of friends.  And for my meal, I had a 6 egg white omelet with spinach and mushrooms.  It was high carb day, so I had a bowl of oatmeal added to my meal.  The food is consistent and for egg whites, very tasty.  Oh yeah, I also had some turkey bacon that actually taste like real bacon.    As for their service, I'd give them 4 stars.  Keep in mind that this is one crazy busy Egg Works on the weekends.  This visit was mid-day and mid-week.  In other words, we were seated right away, got our food right away, and was out of here fairly quick.  Overall, you can't go wrong for breakfast at Egg Works, especially if it's consistency that you're striving for.      YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (487/500)"}
{"text":"I've done Cracked Egg, Broken Yolk in CA, and now Egg Works.  Yes...this was my first time to an Egg Works. I even had the Egg and I bookmarked for quite some time. It's taken me so long to try Egg Works/The Egg and I because the wait was always too long. I was fortunate one Sunday morning to check out this new location in Henderson with a group of BPF's (Best Peeps Forever).  And for an added bonus, the wait was only 20 minutes.  Not bad for a new breakfast hot spot. Not bad for a Sunday morning.   Besides lunch and dinner, breakfast is my favorite meal of the day.  And when it comes to breakfast at a place like this, my order is usually as boring as it gets. I usually get some type of omelet or anything with eggs.  You can't eat at a place named Egg Works for the first time and not have their eggs. I had them create an 6 egg white omelet with spinach & mushrooms.  For an added touch, I had 3 strips of turkey bacon added.  Let me say that this meal was so good that I felt I just had a cheat meal. The omelet was fluffy and tasty, but the it's the mushrooms that was the key to adding flavor to it. Egg Works has more than just eggs and omelets like country fried steaks, chili spaghetti, waffles, and pancakes.  I just didn't get the opportunity on this trip.  And by the way, the prices here are pretty good too.   Like I stated earlier, the wait wasn't too long even though this joint was packed. The service was great and our waiter was very attentive.  When you're done, follow the foot prints on the floor to the register.    Extra, Extra...Read All About It. If you're a newbie to Egg Works or the Egg and I, you'll notice that the menus are in the form of a newspaper.  Extra, Extra...Read All About It.  Look around when once you're seated. You'll notice that since the menu is set up like a newspaper, a handful of patrons read the menu like it's a newspaper.  Just an observation...Ha.

{"text":"Man, I love Egg Works.  It's not fancy.  In fact, it's not even going for that.  It's the old flannel shirt of the Las Vegas breakfast scene.  Sometimes, that's just what you need.  There's something refreshing about a non-hipster breakfast joint that is not trying too hard.  From the country chic decor to the consistently good breakfast food and strong coffee, this place earns a regular spot in my breakfast rotation.    I've had a number of good dishes, but my go to is the South of the Border skillet, half size, because the regular portion is humongous.  It's off menu but worth the hassle of asking for it, because it's just that good.  Chicken, potatoes, jalapenos, onions, green peppers cooked together and topped with tons of cheese and an egg any style.  With food this good, there is no need to \"deconstruct\" it, give it a fancy name and slap a $19 price tag on it."}
{"text":"To be a good breakfast place, you need 3 things: (1) good food; (2) GREAT coffee; and (3) good service.  Egg Works has these covered.  I live and die by the South of the Border Skillet.  It's off menu, so I am sharing this little nugget with you because I am a regular here and know the secret menu.  You can thank me later.    From the minute you walk in the door here, it's like stepping into a breakfast joint in Gatlinburg, Tennessee (aka the #1 vacation spot for rednecks east of the Mississippi).  I think this is the look they are going for considering all the hokey decor.  I love it!  The hostesses, servers and bussers work together to make sure you get excellent service.  Each table has a little sign on it that you can use to alert your server if you need something, but you won't need to use it because the service is just that good.  The only downside is I could sit for an hour just sipping coffee, but this place is too busy to do that.  When I see the line out the door, I feel too guilty.  So get in as many cups of coffee as you can before turning over your table.  I like to take half my breakfast to go for the next day, but if that isn't your thing, be sure to order the half portion offered for most menu items.  These breakfasts are built for lumberjacks."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! My husband and I come in every Sunday for the past three years and the service is always the best. The waitresses and waiters are friendly, nice and fast service too.  Plus the food is the best. I be tried many different dishes in the menu and not one has ever disappointed me."}
{"text":"Nicole rocks!  But one thing to consider would be having the little train make a stop at Starbucks to get coffee.  We need stronger coffee here. Just a suggestion."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast, blueberry pancakes delicious, service PERFECT with Ashley! My son had a cheeseburger with the works style, said it was the best cheeseburger he's had in awhile!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Today my server was Denis!!! Thanks for the hospitality!!! Love the muffins"}
{"text":"Awesome food and Service. Love how they all work together.  Thank You Amy B for the great service.  And all other team members for working together, you are all Wonderful. That's why every time I'm in town I like to visit this place."}
{"text":"OK, seriously, who is up early enough to have breakfast at the crack of dawn, let alone at breakfast time, and no I don't mean at 2pm!?? and in Vegas?!? After hauling ass at 3am, taking a detour to Vegas thru Needles, we get there way too early for anything else, but hey, its Vegas. Some friends say I just HAD to try this place, if anything, the banant nut muffin.   Makeup not done, hair not done, and literlly 4 hours of sleep, we're there with our big appetites.  We get there and I ask for coffee, and immediately its served. Server was very nice and even took time to explain some of their specialties, their famous potatoes, and even their banana nut muffin. I was supposed to get a choice between a muffin or toast, but because I was a first timer, she gave me both.   Muffin - Was like a taste of sweet heaven! Talk about an orgasmic feeling, and get your head out of the gutters! Made fresh, served warm where the butter melted on direct impact. I was in another world and forgot where I was at. This was the best banana nut muffin I've ever had.  I ordered the country skillet which is basically their potatoes topped with country fried steak, 2 eggs and their country gravey- Potatoes were to die for. Not your usual potatoes, but these were crispy and served with season salt. I was in love with the potatoes itself! Only downfall was that the potatoes are better off on the side vs topped with all that other good stuff.   Friend ordered corn beaf and hash - defintely excellent, but I still favored my country skillet.   Service was excellent. Coffee was never empty, and defintely service with a smile. If you haven't been here yet, this is definitely worth the drive from the strip, even more so, if you're up early enough, this is definintely the place to go."}
{"text":"Our server, NICOLE wowed us with her friendly personality, genuine interest in our first visit to Egg works and her attentive service! We are breakfast fanatics, so to find both service and delectable food from seasoned potatoes to banana nut muffins to the southwest eggs - made my heart sing. We absolutely will be back and will highly recommend EGG WORKS!!"}
{"text":"Our server Candice was amazing. Would definitely come back just because the service was that good. Food was normal diner food. I had the waffle works, nothing too exciting."}
{"text":"I dont know about you but i feel a bit uncomfortable when i have to walk around the restaurant aimlessly searching for somebody to take my take out order.   Yesterday i was actually hungry for lunch which doesnt happen too often and without the help of Yelp (stupid me) i just drove till something caught my eye. \"Egg Works\" sure why not everybody talks this place up so ill give it a whirl. I walked in asked the hostess if i could place a to go order, she said go back there and just kinda pointed toward the rear of the place, walking back there a tiny waitress made eye contact and i thought great somebody to help me when i asked about a to go order she ignored me and walk away, i got to the back counter where i was surrounded by 4 additional waitresses when i mentioned a to go order i again was ignored.... really? It wasnt till a few minutes later yet another waitress came by to take my order as i was lost till then... why couldnt somebody be just slightly friendly.   I asked the waitress about the salads and just had her pick her favorite, \"The Cobb\" is what she came up with and served it with balsamic which i was fine with. Even came with the famed muffin on the side which was tasty as 5hit, and even still warm. My salad was to say the least HUGE, i felt like Adam from man versus food and food lost because i have to share the salad with a co worker to finish it. Chunks of turkey, ham, bacon, egg, avocado, etc, etc it was well put together and fresh. At $10 for the salad and muffin its not too bad as it really serves two people.   Overall will i be back? En not till i figure out what else is in the surrounding area as the service just killed it for me. Thats half the meal for me."}
{"text":"An old buddy of mine was in town and wanted to meet for breakfast so I suggested Egg Works. It's close to my house yet I've never dined there and it was about time. It's now become one of my favorite places to go if I'm with someone who wants an early morning meal.  I don't usually eat breakfast and I don't even like any breakfast items (I hate eggs, pancakes, etc.), and that's why I never go to a breakfast place. I was dreading my meal and I figured I was going to be resigned to sipping on a coffee and watching while he ate. Imagine my surprise and how thrilled I was to find that Egg Works also has lunch / brunch food on their menu! It's not just a sea of pancakes and omelettes!   As you'd expect, there are a TON of egg dishes. You can get eggs just about any way you can imagine. If you're a fan of eggs, you will adore this place. Ditto for other breakfast items like french toast, hash browns, and more. I was tickled to find a large section of non-breakfast items that didn't just seem like an afterthought. They have a great selection of salads, sandwiches, burgers and chili.   My friend ordered a waffle with strawberries and whipped cream and it was huge, fluffy, fresh and delicious. I got a bowl of their supposedly \"famous\" Cincinnati chili. I'm a big chili fan and theirs is good but not great. They cheerfully loaded it with shredded cheese for me and as we all know, cheese makes everything better!  They have great beverages too, including alcoholic options, soda (Coke products), freshly squeezed juices, fancy coffees, and plain old watery American coffee. Service was super fast and efficient, and the atmosphere relaxing.   This is the perfect spot if you're looking for a hearty breakfast and you have non-breakfast eaters in tow. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"EGG WORKS (SUNSET & EASTERN) UP TO IT'S USUAL STANDARD   OK, so after the fiasco at the Egg & I in Webster, TX,  (see my review \"Egg & I in Webster, TX., Proves Disappointing\") we couldn't wait to get back to our usual Egg Works (part of the Egg & I chain in Vegas) in our hometown of Vegas.  We bee lined there yesterday (11/30/13), and here's what we found.  Usual fabulous service?  Check.   Usual tasty meals?  Check, check.  Usual fast, efficient and jovial staff?  Check.  Usual two-for-one coupon?  Check.  Manager Sherie and server Raul did a fine job, as is typical of all the staff at this location.  This place is The Gold Standard in the Egg & I franchise, and should be emulated by the entire franchise chain across the US.  NOTE:  The Egg & I in Webster, TX, is owned by a totally different franchisee, hence the vast difference in quality between the Houston locations and the Egg & I/Egg Works chain in Vegas.  This time I eschewed my usual Huevos Rancheros and chose the Taco Scramble, something I had never tried.  It was fabulous!  I ordered some warm flour tortillas on the side, slathered them with butter, and made a series of mini-burritos.  Yuuuummm!  I ended up bringing about half of the dish home (their portions are ample) for breakfast this morning.  Double Yuuummmm!  As we left the restaurant yesterday there was a line outside and we ended up chatting with a couple from out of town, on their first visit there.  We gave them one of our remaining two-for-one coupons to use, and wished them a fine day.  I knew they were in for a treat, and so will you be when you get there.  Dean Herrington"}

{"text":"Don't eat outside. It's the attack of the birds. The birds are everywhere and it's hard to eat your food. The food it good, but the birds suck. We couldn't enjoy our food or our stay at this place."}
{"text":"We went off the strip for breakfast and I'm glad we did!  the staff was super friendly and the food was really good I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way out of town for breakfast. It was decent, very large portions... Better to share I think. It was clean and the waitress was great. Overall a good experience and good price."}
{"text":"I got the spinach eggs Benedict and it was SO good. Best breakfast I've had since moving to vegas. The fruit was fresh and the service was great. You can sit outside and the outside area is pet friendly."}
{"text":"Hands down the best service and good i have had in a while! I am not an easy person to impress! I was soooo impressed and satisfied! Our server Austin went out of his way to make our experience at eggworks the most amazing you could possibly make it. Country fried steak with rye toast! My boyfriend waffle tbreakfast for 9.95 substitute pancakes! My boyfriend mentioned it was my birthday and our server over heard and the came out and sang to me it was seriously such a nice surprise! The smiles, happiness, the FOOD!! Everything was over what I expected I wil be back every time I'm here in Vegas!"}
{"text":"EAT HERE FOR THEIR POTATOES. Potatoes are good enough to keep you coming back. Service is kept in check with their happy egg / sad egg system. Need something? Flip your egg to sad and they'll quickly assist you.  The Menu? GIANT. I love how the menu is like a newspaper. Never did trying to figure out what to eat look so intellectual.  My preferred food: Most of the Mexican food is tasty. My favorite right now is the Mexican Omelette that includes green chilies / chorizo / jalepenos and served with seasoned potatoes. That was the bee's knees. Ol standby is Huevos Rancheros, which is also very good. Or just get a mound of potatoes. Yeah, they are pretty freaking good. Pork Carnitas Burrito has some decent heat, meat is a little too drippy though, but not a bad decision.  A few things to remember:  This is a breakfast place. A casual breakfast place. Stick to casual breakfast foods. The Mexican dishes are generally pretty good. The omelettes are the heavy hitters. Once you wander off the reservation, that's when you get disappointed.   One example: The Crazy Chicken omelette is gross. The description states a julienned chicken breast but it was more like salty cubes of chicken. The other ingredients (mushrooms / guacamole / muenster cheese / sour cream) do NOT mesh together. You get a gloopy mess at the end. Anything that offers upscale meat (prime rib) you should be weary of. Stick to traditional breakfast foods.  And if the food you ordered isn't great, they still come with potatoes most of the time. It's always the positive."}
{"text":"One of  my favorite places in Las Vegas for breakfast. I have to admit I love the potatoes and the banana nut muffins. I try to mix it up with what I order and not get the same menu items every time but as a avocado addict I tend to search them out."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. The food is delicious and our server Hector was awesome.  The potato's were fantastic and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"Standard breakfast food. Take the seasoned potatoes over the hash browns."}
{"text":"This is just a great place to eat with reasonable prices on freshly made food. Gotta try their tuna melt , awesome....yummers ..."}
{"text":"meh. very meh. i guess my expectations were set too high looking at the 4 star average review for the place but it leaves me wondering where have these people been eating breakfast and why is this considered to be somewhat of a breakfast institution. it all makes sense when you compare it to crack egg's 4 star average, another place i dont care for, but not put next to hash house a go go's 4 stars-a completely different breakfast experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the great song selection (hoobastank just to name one) and even better egg themed dishes. Oh, and the menus that were like news papers was a perfect substitute for a common place and at times borish menu seen at other \"hot spots\". It was very avant-garde and new age. You could even say it was eggcellent. Server was Lisa C. and provided wonderful service!"}
{"text":"My server totally deserves 5 stars!!! Hector had amazing hair and wonderful service...... couldn't help but to keep staring at his hair. He has better hair than my friend and I. I hope he wasn't feeling like we were perving on him. It was his hair that we couldn't help but stare. But anyways.......back to the service.......It was as fabulous as his hair. He was very kind, and prompt. The food was delish!!!! I'd love to keep going back as long as Hector is there. He's the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and I was invited back by the owner. He was courteous enough to send me a gift card to come back. We were greeted and quickly seated right as we entered the doors. Unfortunately, I sat there for a good 10 minutes just for the waiter to come and take my orders for drinks. Alongside with this, it is not busy at all. I don't understand why it took them this long to come and take my order for some water. We flipped the egg to a sad face and finally, someone who was NOT the waiter at my area, came and got us water. Our waiter didn't come until 15 minutes later after being seated. I was very disappointed already. Afterwards, she took our orders(didn't introduce herself at all) and doesn't even come back with the food. Someone else came and brought us our food(which keep in mind, took forever). I ordered the NY steak again and this time, I thought it was going to be a lot better. I ordered medium rare so I was hoping the cook was right this time. However, we didn't get to eat until 6 minutes later. We both kept raising our hands and our waiter looked at us, then looked away. Is she purposely ignoring us or something? She went up to the table near us and brought them a bottle of ketchup and I called for her...still no response. Her name is Brandy by the way. The person who noticed us was Fernando and he was the table cleaner. He was the only one who helped and asked if we needed anything else. He also brought us the A1 sauce. Big shout out to Fernando, their table cleaner. I feel like they are not credited enough since they've done more than the waitress/waiters have had. We began eating and everything was good. My sunny side up eggs were delicious and the toast was the best. But then I got to the steak and was fairly disappointed AGAIN!!! The steak was SO DRY. I took a picture and you can see how there is no juice whatsoever. It's just oily and dry. Big disappointment and VERY upsetting. My boyfriend ordered the Steak benny this time. ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT!!! After he broke open the egg, it turns out they were undercooked. White liquid gushed out of the eggs. That means the whites of the eggs were not even cooked. It would be okay if they were cloudy but you can clearly see they were just clear. Now we question why this place is top rated when they can't even cook their eggs properly. We understand bennies need to be partially raw. But this was just really pure raw. I have pictures for proof. Just look at them...After the food, we complained to the waitress and she didn't really seem to caring. In fact, she was trying to back herself up saying things like how shes busy with the new chefs in training so she wasn't able to cater us much. Also said something like how she came back twice...but she only came back twice after I gave her the bitch face since i was sitting there for 20 minutes not being able to eat.  THERE WASN'T EVEN MANY PEOPLE THERE!!! It was like less than 7 tables being used! We told her how we most likely won't be coming back and she says: \"Sounds good!\"  Wow. I am astounded by the customer service here. I mean, at least this time the cashier wasn't a total bitch. I'm not coming back. It's just too disappointing since I actually enjoy eating at egg and I on Sahara and Eggworks on Fortapache."}
{"text":"Wow Donna made my experience at egg works great! Food was fantastic at a great price! She was so helpful explaining all the food and how the signs work on the table. Hope you make it to Disney!"}

{"text":"I was looking on Yelp for a new place to go for breakfast when I saw Egg Works (which I'd never heard of) and saw they had several locations. Driving from Boulder City, we decided to try the Eastern and Sunset location. It was well worth the drive!! It was pretty busy but we were seated right away and our drink order was taken within seconds. The servers were friendly, diligent and energetic. The food came quickly and was delicious. I will most definately be a return customer!!"}
{"text":"First let me say that the food is great! I normally go to the one on Sahara. But I went to this one, and I probably went at the wrong time; hence the review. There is a reason why I order a water and then ice tea,  I drink a lot because it's necessary for me being a disabled veteran. I received my food and received my check. And my waitress never checked on me again. As I left she asked if I wanted drinks to go and I said no but it would've been nice to get refills while I was here.   I am not dumb to the game of, it's the end of my shift and I want to get out of here. And so I will remember it is better to go to In N Out Burger for $7 then to come here for $15 and not get a refill. Or as I did.   Perhaps they just have to stick with the Sahara location. The food is so good I can't give it six stars seven stars. But the abysmal service ruined the morning, afternoo perhaps they just have to stick with the Sahara location. The food is so good I can't give it six stars seven stars. But the abysmal service ruined the morning, noontime.  As my waitress said after I mentioned refills during my stay, \"oh well, have a good day.\""}
{"text":"Not bad for a breakfast spot. We have been coming here since we moved to the area.  The skillets are pretty good. Most of the menu items are good. Multiple trips are okay  Eggs are fairly decent for a busy place like EDubs.  Corned beef hash used to be good. Beware!  Good kids menu.  Get here early or later if you don't want to be stuck waiting.  Also, look for the 1/2 off or b1g1 coupons in the local newspapers."}
{"text":"Two weeks had passed since the original review and after a couple emails with Egg Works exchanged I was assured that they had fixed the problem. I had returned on 05/23/14 and ordered the Patty Melt.  I must say I would have instantly traded this burger for one that was well done. At best, triple-extra-well is the best way to describe it. I had noticed that the food was taking a long time to cook -- and the reason was that my burger needed an extra 15 minutes on the grill. If only there was a way to post a picture on an \"update\". Briefly described, both the bread and burger were on the grill far too long. One side of the burger patty was blackened and crunchy, like it was forgotten. Forgotten, but still served to the customer. The bread was grilled to the crunchy consistency of a cracker.  After this visit, it is safe to say I will not return."}
{"text":"Eggcelent food lol!! I was surprised with the quick turn around, in and out quick! The food was excellent quality, served piping hot, and with a warm smile from our nice waitress. I highly recommend the chile rellano (spelling?) omelet!   Note: the plates are huge, my girlfriend and I split a plate and were stuffed."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and decided to stop and grab some grub.  It was our first time there and we loved the atmosphere and on the tables there are happy cards and unhappy cards. Every restaurant should have this!  If it's your fist time there, you get a free muffin and it was delicious.  The food was good but they need to offer a military discount. We only had to flip the card once because they kept forgetting to bring our refills after we asked, but other than that it was a home-like feel and good cooking. Also the location in Summerlin is a very good location and a very beautiful area."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time a couple weeks ago and had the best experience. We sat on the outdoor patio which is also dog friendly! Our server was kind, knowledgeable, and personable. Also, the banana nut muffins are to die for! I definitely recommend bringing your family, your date, your dog, friends etc."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast (Mexican omelet) and employees were welcoming and friendly. I will diffidently return on my next trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"I saw the reviews and was like \"hey,let's go check this place out\" friends were in town so we brought them here. Place is easy to find, lots of parking and we went in the morning on Labor Day. No wait! Walked in and there is a cute train that goes around inside (loved it!) then awesome music since I love country, very cute atmosphere inside. Hostess and waiter was very nice as well with great attitude.   Food was not to die for me that is, I had the French toast. It was ok :( and my husband had a skillet (he loved it) and my friend had the banana bread French toast (she loved it) but her pouch egg was way too watery. Her husband had the mash potato omelet he also loved his food. So I will try it again but something else ;-)"}
{"text":"Loved it!!!! Food is amazing!!!   The atmosphere is not very appealing, but the staff and delicious food sure make up for that!   The staff is friendly and inviting, and our waitress anticipated our needs very well.  The strawberry cream-cheese french toast is an absolute must. I would get all the dressings on the side that way you can add it to your own liking. Also the portions are gigantic! Either come with an empty tummy and big appetite, or share with your friend."}
{"text":"Very large portions!  Very delicious!  Great service, and love the train set!  I got the Pork Carnitas burrito with a side of season potatoes.  Cannot eat it all in one sitting!  Hubbs got the Texas French Toast minus the apple compote.  DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Simply AMAZING!! The food is exquisite, the service that we got from Candace was OUTSTANDING! I want to come here every day from now on. The loco moco and the banana bread toast are simply out of this world needless to say their OJ is sooo fresh. Congrats guys!!"}
{"text":"tip: check out the vast newspaper style menu while you wait.  Short wait in a very spacious breakfast joint.  This and Egg and I are within the same company.  Crepe was very cheesy but good. Great service. Can customize everything. Oatmeal with blueberry prefect for babies. Corn beef hash very tasty.  The popular potatoes were also very tasty with a hint of spice.  The banana muffin is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ohh my goodness.   So while in Vegas, I decided to just scope the local area out on a Tuesday morning when I spotted this place and noticed the parking lot was packed (on a weekday?!) I had to give it a try. I am so thankful that I did.   I ordered the Mexican Omelette, which is made with four eggs, btw, and it's pretty large. I almost finished and I usually never eat large breakfast portions, but it was delicious, I couldn't put the fork down.   I am avoiding pork, so I asked them to hold the chorizo, and it was so perfect. The potatoes on the side were also super yummy! Sorry that I didn't snap a pic before it was eaten.   Oh, and, not that it truly matters much, but the service was also above average, and being a former server myself, I genuinely appreciated the hospitality.   Thank you Egg Works, I will come back next time!"}
{"text":"food serving is BIG make sure you ask if there is half portions! our waiter forgot to mention it."}
{"text":"I love this place ! This is the first place we stop before going to our hotel Lol. The food is just too good. They start you off with a banana muffin which is just amazing. Then I usually always get the chicken enchilada with potatoes on the side and maybe just maybe if their is anymore space in my tummy I'll order a side of pancakes  Super good & cheap place really recommend it."}
{"text":"This morning I decided to try out Egg Works by my hotel because it had great reviews and I was not disappointed. The Biscuits & Gravy where amazing. I must say some of the best I have ever had. Trust me on this, I have eaten my share of Biscuits & Gravy. The staff were very friendly and Donna who took care of me was awesome!!  Thanks for a great breakfast and for the calories."}
{"text":"Just moved to vegas. Finally checked this place out after driving past it several times! I went for breakfast and got the country style eggs Benedict. It was soooo good! I also really loved the spicy house potatoes that went along with it. Servers were nice and food was delivered quick !"}
{"text":"Always a great choice for your hangover needs, or your after church reprisal of 'the last brunch'. You will literally stuff your face with all of their awesome food. ASHLEY was our amazing server,  and she totally deserves high accolades for treating her customers quickly and satisfactorily (is that a word? Sure.)."}
{"text":"Amy L. Was a great server. She is the best!! The food here is great. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs and the gravy is amazing."}
{"text":"Egg Works. When has an egg ever worked in its life. These eggs don't even break a sweat trying to get to my table. When I eat my eggs I clean them and make sure they are shined and have no traces of animal in my food. Vegan alert. I'm a vegan and I cannot stand the fact there might have been a living chicken in my egg. Now tell me. What do you do if you get a chicken in one of your eggs. You better raise that til it's fully grown. Chickens are made to enjoy life on this world. Not be slaughtered for some deviled eggs. Deviled eggs, it says it in the name! Satan's eggs! I have the egg minder smart app to constantly remind me if my eggs are going bad or if there is a living being inside. I have my mounted on my dashboard to check 24/7 how my eggs are doing. Bet you don't do that egg works. Sorry but I don't want a rooster in my scrambled eggs and toast. Time to rethink your business. When I ordered poached eggs, they actually used a poacher. They stole eggs off a living chicken in Africa and used its precious eggs for the poached eggs! This is not what I asked for! Good day sir!"}
{"text":"$3 for a small cup of coffee which is kinda crazy but other than that it's great. Homemade hash is fantastic and the place is huge so the wait isn't very long. Best breakfast in town overall."}
{"text":"Donna was our server today, she always makes our visit to egg works even more enjoyable. She is quick, efficient and friendly. Donna goes above and beyond to make sure her guests are happy. Not to mention the food here is always delicious and fresh! Thank you Donna!"}
{"text":"I met clients here for bfast since they open early. There were four in our party and the waitress was attentive and friendly.  Being a homemade corn beef fan, I opted for this entree and when it arrived the size was overwhelming large like most of the entrees here. The corn beef was unfortunately overly salty and inedible so I only ate part of my scrambled eggs. When the waitress came by to check on us, I mentioned how bad my corn beef was and she asked if I wanted anything else which I declined. When our waitress returned she advised me she advised the chef and removed my entree from the bill which was a nice gesture. Everybody else in our party seemed to be happy with their food.  I won't let this negative experience keep me away from Egg Works - hopefully the next experience will be better."}
{"text":"I like the fact that Egg Works opens at 6:00 am during weekdays! I arrived and there were several patrons present already. I asked the waitress what she suggested  and recommended the carnitas topped with eggs & served on a flour tortilla, potatoes and fruit.  The carnitas was really tasty and my eggs were prepared perfectly over medium. I'm not a fan of the potatoes here for some reason. I think it might be the shape and seasoning they use. Just give me some crispy hash browns and I'm a happy dude. The sliced pineapple was super sweet and the quantity of my dish was huge. Couldn't even get close to finishing the entree.  Overall a clean place with many options to choose from and solid service."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place - I just think I ordered the wrong items... TV's are all around (but not overdone) which is great to wake up on a Saturday and start watching some sports - loved it.  The menu was cute and fun - not to mention a great selection  My wife had the jeuvos rancheros which were good. I had the chili (which was OK - probably out of a can though) and onion rings.  Now the onion rings were obviously the frozen type - but just so tasteless and meaningless that you wonder why they even bother to put it on their menu.  All the other food looks so appetizing, then you have these crappy onion rings.  They would be better off to upgrade them or take them off the menu. I wish that I would have stuck to egg-based menu items...  The service was excellent, and everyone was very nice.    Oh yea, and the wifi (while free) did not work (strong signal, just wouldn't put you online after connecting)."}
{"text":"laaaawd have mercy! Definitely a place to feed the natives lol!! Huge MAHALO to Donna our waitress! awesome customer service with a warm welcoming feel!! on it like a hornet making sure our first time experience was BIG! Mahalo Donna for an awesome experience til the next time.... A Hui Hou!"}
{"text":"Great Breakfast Spot in Las Vegas. Visiting from Los Angeles. My first time trying an omelet and is was amazing. Service was great. Candace made sure to check on my table and refill our drinks before they got too low. She has and amazing smile and personality. All around great service and food."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Great service. Our server was andrienne and she was awesome. I ordered the breakfast burrito. I really have no complaints. Definitely the best egg works/egg n I I've been to."}
{"text":"Egg Works is our favorite! Great food, sweet staff, and a family-friendly atmosphere. The potatoes and banana nut muffins are especially delicious!"}
{"text":"The best potatoes I've ever had! Our waitress, Maegan, was absolutely fantastic! She was sweet, informative, and on top of our drinks making sure our cups were never empty! I had a lot of questions about the menu and she knew how to answer all of them and helped me to order a meal that has now become my favorite! If you happen to eat there, ask to be seated in her section!!!"}
{"text":"I came to Egg Works with some skepticism.  I am not a huge fan of eggs.  The only reason I came was to attend a focus group survey meeting.  I came a skeptic.  I left a fan.  I ordered a Hawaiian breakfast.  I had rice, Spam, eggs, and fresh fruit.  It was great.  I love Spam and the egg yolk mixed into the rice was a delicious combination.  I have not been back since that time because it is not on my side of town.  If I do make it back though, and I hope that time comes, I want to try the biscuits and gravy.  I saw somebody order that and it looked awesome.  The plate, more of a platter, was huge.  The biscuits, though thoroughly covered in gravy, looked to be big and fluffy.  Even from a distance I could see the sausage in the gravy.  I must try this.  The food I got was great.  The food I saw looked amazing.  Service was a tad slow but it was a busy Saturday morning.  Wait staff can only go so fast when the restaurant is near capacity.  That is another sign that Egg Works is nothing short of grand."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  Chile relleno omelet was delicious! Endless coffee refills. The train that runs through the restaurant was fun to watch for both adults and children alike. The menu is a newspaper very cute idea. Definitely will go back"}
{"text":"Really good food. Really good service. No wait at all to be seated. Banana nut muffins are delicious! I got the three pigs omlet and it was huge. It was good and I loved that it had real cheese on it. The husband got an egg dish with chili. The chili was really good. His plate was better than mine. Delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place I go get breakfast there all the time the coffee is good and I'm not a coffee person love ordering there omelets I get the works one all the time and the muffins are to die for awesome service too!"}
{"text":"Chantelle was amazing!! She had the best customer service at a restaurant that I've ever received! She offered us so many different little extra things and really gave her opinion just where it was needed! For instance I got just a regular plain two stack buttermilk pancakes and as I was eating she offered me extra syrup and this delicious strawberry syrup that they make fresh daily! It was so great! Thanks Chantelle!"}
{"text":"Service is great, very friendly and checks in regularly. Breakfast this morning was good, just like the couple other times I've been. Egg white omelet with avocado, \"salsa\" , strawberries (not fresh, tasted defrosted perhaps), toast and potatoes. My friend got chocolate chip pancakes and lived them.  Total for 2 breakfasts was $24, minus tip."}
{"text":"***late review***  My mom got us a groupon for here. Super cute inside! We got sat right away and drink orders taken quickly. Our server, Maryann, what a doll!! She took such great care of us, was super sweet and fun! Food could have been crap and still would give 5 stars cause I'm so all about that customer service, and Maryann has it! But, luckily the food wasn't crap! It was bomb! I'm not a meat eater but now and again I'll have tuna. Their tuna melt is the best!!!!! Real tuna, melted perfect cheese and the parmesan sour dough??? Lawdy!!! Perfect! Seasoned fries are great too!!! My mom had a Bloody Mary and said it was the real deal! We loved everything about our experience here!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and ridiculously high prices (10$ for two pancakes the size of my hand). Omelette had cheese on the outside, which made it covered in a sheen of grease. Breakfast burrito was good, though. All in all, does not live up to the hype."}
{"text":"No wait at the Diner Bar. Excellent food, Potatoes are Fantastic. Cappuccino was great as well. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I are new in town and dropped our dog off across the street. As we pulled out of the shipping center I saw the Egg Works sign. Before I could look at the whole building, I noticed people walking in with their dogs!!! We decided to give them a try. Before we could take in all the great smell of food, there were multiple host happy and eager to seat us.   Joshua was helpful from the start. I ordered the mash potatoe omelette and with seasoned potatoes and I was not disappointed. After 2 bites I knew, I had found my new favorite breakfast spot! We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the pancakes, and our party of eight had a variety of dishes with no complaints. The waitress and cashier were friendly and accommodating. Overall a great breakfast, and experience."}
{"text":"Donna was our server. She was friendly and fun!  Food is the best - banana muffin is supreme. Service Is super quick. Thanks Donna!  We enjoyed meeting you!"}
{"text":"Great place for Brunch.  They have so much stuff I need to make many more trips to try it all out.  I had the Banana Bread french toast which was very delicious.  I also had the Cincy Chili, but being from Ohio, it was not what I would consider Cincy Chili (Cincy Chili is sweet), this was just regular chili served on spaghetti."}
{"text":"Meh... after having such awesome service at other Egg Works in town I can tell this particular one falls short.  We were told that we would have to wait about 15 minutes, which actually came to only 10 minutes, which was great. Our waitress was friendly, but would forget a few things that we needed, such as utensils and coffee.  I had asked if the sausage I ordered was indeed turkey and she took it back and had it remade without telling me that that was going to happen.   So I had to wait for my breakfast to come back and then when I placed an additional order of turkey sausage for my husband, we waited 20 minutes for that to appear.  In all honesty this breakfast just took way to long to be served and the miscommunication was the problem.  I've never had any sort of issue with the other Egg Works I've been to so I guess I'll be returning to those other locations instead of this one.  Overall this place is just meh... not really my favorite."}
{"text":"Free banana nut muffin (the moistest we've ever had) with your Yelp checkin if it doesn't already come with your meal. Service was supperb (albeit with inconsistent 'darling's)."}
{"text":"Food was good, their potatoes are deliciously seasoned. Service was wonderful I had my 2 year old with me and the staff was very accommodating with him. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Traveling in to Vegas , I found my hotel continental breakfast wanting.... Travelled to Eggworks, about 10 minutes from the hotel, and was amazed! It's exactly what a breakfast place should be - good portions, good prices, friendly service, and even free wifi. We had Candice as our server and even though she was a trainee she handled out order like a pro. I highly recommend Eggworks for your breakfast needs whilst in Vegas. (I had the Mexican omelette and could not even finish the huge portion)"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Food is always excellent and service is great!  Today, Veronica was wonderful!!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Arrived one hour before closing. Staff was primarily concerned with closing up around us while we were dining instead of closing down in sections and not disturbing customers. Although we had an excellent waitperson we could not find them when needed. Food quality was not up to standards we were used to in other locations. On a cold day they had already tuned off the heat in the raestaurant. THIS LOCATION NEEDS STRONG MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION"}
{"text":"I love eggs!..this is a great breakfast spot with outside patio. P.S See Manny for muffin specials"}
{"text":"Just absolutely love starting my day at Egg Works with friends or by myself. The service is always incredible. Today Manuela was my server and I couldn't have had a better experience."}
{"text":"Hello to all Yelpers!  We showed up an hr before close and our waitress forgot to put in our food order. We were pretty upset and on a time crunch but couldn't do anything about it. We flipped the unhappy face on the table and made it known that we were not happy.   Marc, came to us to ask if things were ok.. so we told him our issue. He was very sorry, comped our whole meal, had the waitress come by to give us a genuine apology and also gave us muffins while we waited for our food. The food came after 5-7 min and he always surprised us with a carrot cake that was wrapped all pretty in a blue shear wrap.  My reaction was, \"wow!\" I've never had a person redeem themselves and represented the the quality of this restaurant as much as he did. I was floored by how he handled the situation. He smiled the whole time and was a true professional.   We left a fat tip for the waitress and appreciated the the special treatment. We love Egg works always enjoyed our time at this location. We have been known to stop going to diners because of bad service and such.   Egg Works kept my business and I wanted to share my great experience with others just to show that even in this busy diner, you can still get 5 star service and smiles from all the staff..   Thank you Marc for your amazing super service! Because you made a difference. People like you bring success to any service driven industry. If we owned that type of business, we'd have to steal you away from Egg Works.. You are a true asset to the company and i hope they know how lucky they are to have you!  Greatly appreciated customers,   Sami and Scott"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try out this location after receiving a coupon in the mail.  Items ordered: Pumpkin & Banana Pancakes, Pumpkin & Chocolate Chip Pancakes, Spinach Benny and an Island Style Breakfast with Portugese Sausage, Rice & Eggs and a Banana Nut Muffin. Everything was delicious! :)  Restaurant Is very spacious & clean. Service was excellent.  Our waitress Amanda was awesome!!! She made our dining experience even more enjoyable.  We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"The breakfast here has usually been good. Pretty standard breakfast stuff. Today I tried their corned beef and I guess it was surprising because it was like they took it straight from the can and dumped it on a plate. I asked the server if it was canned corned beef and he said no before I ordered it or I wouldn't have ordered it. Well if that's not canned then they must've threw it in a blender.  The kids had regular kids meals and they were all good.  In the past when I've come here it's been straight forward, and so I will get over it. I just wish the server had at least answered my question accurately."}
{"text":"We loved our breakfast here! Came after our morning hike at Red Rock Canyon and ordered the chile relleno omelet, a breakfast sandwich, and the island favorite with Portuguese sausage and steamed rice. The banana nut muffins are the best and the breakfast potatoes are amazing. Daniel was the best server-very attentive and he wants to take his nieces to Disneyland"}
{"text":"It was my first time a week ago, and I loved it. Service was super fast, after my friend and I ordered, we probably got our food 5-10 minutes later. Our waiter was very welcoming and friendly I mean she looked like she just loved life everyday, lol! Anyways, the food we ordered were so good, after I finished mine, I started eating my friend's food. Hahaha. We'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is okay.  The food is good but a bit pricey.  The cheapest breakfast item is $8.75? Okay, they do give you a  muffin but still, just 2 eggs, potatos and bacon for that price? I get the same exact thing at COCO's for $4.99.  The homefries are really good though and they do give you a nice amount of them, so that is good!  The muffin ( a bran banana nut it seemed like) was not even that good.  If they eliminated the muffin maybe they can have a 5.99 breakfast item which would be better I think.  I spent over $12 for breakfast to go......... for breakfast and an OJ.  The staff was super friendly though.  Not sure who often I would return as spending almost $13 for breakfast for just me is a bit much."}
{"text":"I just came here today because of the waffles reviews and I got so disappointed because it was horrible, cold and mushy. Hash browns were extremely salty. Rude server also, didn't warn us about the surplus amount of hash browns we accidentally ordered."}
{"text":"I came to this place because the reviews were amazing, so I figured it would be worth it. Boy was I wrong. Walking in didnt feel welcoming, no personality in any of the servers. Our server Ashely seemed like we were bothering her because she was moody, and didnt make my husband and I feel like we were welcomed. The potatoes were very salty, we both got the classic breakfast. I was disappointed because due to all the great reviews I was expecting to have an Amazing breakfast. We will stick with Rise & shine in southern highlands. Their servers are at least happy to be at their jobs and make people feel welcomed. Another one bites the dust!"}
{"text":"A good place if you want a large plate of food at affordable prices. The breakfast food was good.  I had the Hawaii Breakfast special.  The large plate of food came with eggs, pineapple, sausages, and rice.  The rice doesn't seem to fit.  The food was great and hit the spot.  Oh yeah, don't skip over the fresh made banana nut muffins.  They were delicious."}
{"text":"This is a very simple and good breakfast joint. The service is always good and the food has been great every time I'm here. The coffee has a great flavor and you can sit and drink your full of it.  This is your classic egg house. The skillets are loaded and will fill you up! The potatoes have a great seasoning without being overpowering.   They have the classic flip egg sign at the table so you get service whenever you need it. The price is reasonable, really good for what you get food wise."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and as the reviews state the food was very good and the service was also excellent.  I Like the Omlette House on Charleston for Corned Beef Hash, but the service, atmosphere, and food makes this now my first choice.  Can't compare the cornbeef hash as I have not had it at Egg Works, but my Chile Omlette was excellent.    Won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Egg Works is my family's go-to breakfast joint that never fails.  Large portions at reasonable prices, a variety of sweet and savory breakfasts, and a lunch menu make this the perfect place for a quick bite.  Breakfast potatoes are what make a meal for me, and the Hablo Diablo seasoned potatoes are the best. The name makes you think they'd be hot, but they aren't.   Sophie is an outstanding waitress. Very kind and attentive.  Only reason I give four out of five stars is that it gets busy and parking can be tight."}
{"text":"We have been to this location a few years back, and did not enjoy the idea of being hurried through our meal. However, we liked the food last time, and decided to give it another try. We were determined this time to not be hurried through our meal by the wait staff.  We were seated at a two-top in the back next to the counter seating. We ordered quickly, and received our food quickly as well. We ordered the Bandito Scramble. This included chorizo, jalapenos, cilantro, cheddar, diced green chilies and a side of 'habla diablo original salsa', topped with sour cream. This also came with seasoned potatoes and we chose the banana muffin over the toast.  The scramble was pretty tasty. It was not spicy at all, and the combination of the salsa and sour cream made it even better. The salsa was nothing special. It was more like a picante sauce, very mild and not chunky. The seasoned potatoes were alright, but seasoned way too heavily. They were red from all of the seasoning. My guess is that it was Lawry's seasoned salt.  I would have preferred a lot less of this on the potatoes.   On a Sunday, our wait was about 20 minutes. Service was quick, and friendly. Not too bad."}
{"text":"Alright.... alright.... alright!!!!!! Crazy to say but this is my first review of 2018. Yes, I've been slacking BUT...... I'm on the constant grind and sometimes Yelp has to take a backseat but I still got love for you. Now let's get into this review.   Stopped in here on a Sunday morning in between sessions of a conference I was attending. Now.... it being Vegas... and breakfast time.... and Sunday... we knew it would be crowded but the wait wasn't that bad. It took about 20-25 minutes to be seated for two. I'm calling that a win in my book.  Now, the one smidge I would say is that it took maybe 7 minutes or so for initial contact but the manger came by to check on us so it was all good. (I chalk that up to being as crowded as I stated, but not so bad that we wanted to leave. My friend and I were talking and looking at the massive menu anyway).   The place definitely has a down home feel to it with farm murals on the walls. Diner style seating and regular tables.   Now I won't get into the depths of the menu but... think of pretty much any breakfast item and they have it... including crepes (yes crepes and yes the French ones lol. Don't get me started on that smh). But the menu is large and in charge.   I personally went with \"The Works\" omelette with potatoes (legit) and wheat toast with a banana nut muffin (YELP CHECK IN ITEM). My friend went with steak and eggs. I partially wanted to strangle her because she ordered her steak well done.... but.... I remember where I was when I first started eating steak. I didn't grow up in a Household that ordered it any other way. So it took time to work my way to a medium rare. So I partially forgive but partially don't lol. She seemed to enjoy it. And we shared French toast which was divine... soft, fluffy, moist with hot syrup. Man... my mouth waters for that. Service was solid after initial wait. Overall we had a nice experience, even on a crowded Sunday.  This place is definitely on my list to visit again next time I'm in town... which will be October. #FrenchToastGang"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfasts!! The salsas add such flavor to the eggs and omelettes. Banana muffins rock! Bruce was a super server!"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place since moving up to The Lakes over a year ago.  In need of a run to Lee's (which is in the same shopping center) on a Tuesday seemed like the perfect time.  Especially since there was no line wrapping around the building.    We were seated immediately.  5*'s.   Drink orders taken within 5 minutes of sitting down.  5*'s.  Waitress in the uniform pony tail popped over to take our order off the extensive menu within 1 minute of our drink order being taken.  Upon being told we weren't ready, she left and returned 15 minutes later.  2*'s.   HUGE portions.  of Potatoes.    We had at our table.    Chicken enchilada omlet:  very tasty.  could have used a touch of spice.  but over all I'd get it again.   Western omlet:  filled with goodness and the person ordering it took the other 1/2 he couldn't consume at the table..home. and he never ever takes home left overs.    Bandito scramble:  nice combo but kind of bland.  not enough chorizo to make it --wait for it -- EGGciting enough.    Coffee was delicious.  Of course any coffee for me is delicious if they are not serving Star bucks or Seattle's best.    Banana muffin.. worth the entire meal.  Moist, delicious and the alternative to extremely dry toast.   Now we come to the waitress again.  Ok it was a Tuesday and there was never a line waiting and she had several open tables.  I think she might have either been new OR having a bad day but we had to turn our little eggy guy (see pics) to get our check & a to-go box.    Overall I'd say its a great find during the week.  Certainly not worth the wait for the massive lines we've seen on the weekend.   We got in and out in about an hour and 15 minutes and under 50.00.  I'd say it was a good meal."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and let me start off by saying you better get your reading glasses ready because the menu is HUGE! We ended up getting the chili reliano omelette which was recommended to us by our server, the works skillet and the waffle works for my 2 kids to share. Everything was good, nothing especially spectacular but exactly what you would think your ordering.  The banana nut muffins were really moist."}
{"text":"Glad they moved to Anthem location!  My wife and I used to drive across Hendo to the Sunset location.  A bit of a headache but worth it for the jalapeño scramble.  When we saw the location coming together just moments from our house, we were excited!    Super busy here too just like on Sunset. We, of Henderson, truly love our breakfast food. :)  Anyway, Eggworks continues to be our weekend breakfast stop...and some other days too."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and got seated right away (YES!!!). I was scared we were going to have to wait like most brunch places around the area, but it's a big restaurant with lots of seats.   I'm usually not a big fan of banana, but decided to try their banana nut muffin because it was free with a yelp check-in and oh my god it is so good!! It's a soft texture, more like banana nut cake in a muffin shape.   They have these egg shaped cards on the side of your table for you to change to let servers know if you need service or not.   They're known for their habla diablo seasoning, which is more like a seasoned salt mixture. There's not much kick to it, but still makes tasty potatoes. It's also available at the cashier to purchase (along with loaves of their banana nut/carrot cake!)"}
{"text":"This sure is a must whenever in Vegas. I have been to Egg and I (the tourist one) and the wait was about 30 minutes the other time. I came to this one around the same time as the Egg and I from my previous trip and I was seated immediately (1:00pm). They have identical menus and the service is just as great. I guess it just depends on what location you would like to visit. The waiter was very friendly and gave us a couple of banana muffins to try while waiting for our food. We also had a groupon which made us extra happy. I would recommend this eggsensational breakfast hub !"}
{"text":"This was a really great place to eat. The service was excellent, ambiance was busy which normally means it's a good place to dine, the food was hot and well seasoned and tasty and the portions were big-you will leave stuffed. The free banana muffin was delicious! We will definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas and this place was amazing! Excellent menu choices and service was quick and friendly. Breakfasts are large enough to share! Amanda was our server and was fantastic too. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had another great breakfast with the family and our server Jennifer was awesome ! She was very friendly and always on point"}
{"text":"Amazing food all around but the Chili  Rellenos omelet is a must. Great service by Tina!  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Egg Works in Henderson is our favorite breakfast place.  Delicious food, and great service from DONNA!!!"}
{"text":"Love Egg Works for breakfast the food is always fresh! Potatoes and banana muffins are so yummy. I come here at least once a month. Fast and friendly service, nice atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Good brunch. Egg-tensive menu. They even have Loco Moco. Be patient- the wait for food after order can take 15 minutes or more"}
{"text":"The food is great and so is the service! I eat here often. Today I had outstanding service from Manuela!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food! Love the potatoes and fruit plate Everyone is really nice and helpful. They take team work serious at this place. Tamara and Denis are my fav at this location.  Oh yeah, clean location btw."}
{"text":"I had breakfast at Egg Works on Flamingo one day while I was in Vegas.  I had the Cabo Breakfast burrito; my wife had the stuffed french toast. Both were excellent. The service was great; the staff was quite friendly  The place was clean. The decor was very nice (bonus points for not having the tables too close together) and we enjoyed dining there. I'd recommend this place for breakfast to anyone."}
{"text":"Our server John was great! And the food was terrific! On our next visit from Los Angeles we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I knew I was at the right place. Super welcoming and everyone had a smile. The manager, Ashley, and my server PK were great. Ashley took me to my seat with a smile. She was checking out the restaurant and she asked PK, \"What else can we clean today?\"  As a customer at a restaurant what an amazing question to hear from a manager. PK made suggestions for breakfast since it was my first time. Damn it feels good to spend my money at a place with great food and amazing customer service. This will be a stop for me every time I head over to Vegas. Keep it up Egg Works!!"}
{"text":"I rate them a 4 over 5, because they are great and the food is awesome. I have been coming to them for over 3 years and I still only find one issue with the company. When ever my wife and I are just about to eat when we just get our food, the waiter or waitress brings us our receipt immediately... To me I take it as a sign as hurry and eat and leave. Every place I have gone, so far has not been like this, normally when your done or seemed half way there they should notice and then place a bill not place a bill with the food we just ordered and are about to eat.   Yet I am not slamming them they have great customer service and take pride in there business I can see that. I recommend eating the stuffed french toast!!!!"}
{"text":"Donna provided excellent customer service to my son and I. The food was great. Noah cleared his plate. Atmosphere is very welcoming. Love the banana nut muffins and the coffee. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Love the chile relleno omelet and hazelnut coffee. Totally worth the Sunday wait! You can always sit at the bar for quick seating. Raul was awesome!!"}
{"text":"If theres two things you gotta know about me is that I'm from California and I LOVE breakfast. Eggworks is really the only place I'll be eating breakfast at everytime I come to Las Vegas. The portions are good, the price is right and the employees really make you feel welcome. I always get the country fried steak and it is always cooked to perfection and they always put enough gravy on the fried steaks so I have never asked for more. There has always been a wait ever since I first visited but it is totally worth it. I really do recommend coming here if you are from out of town because it is worth it. Plus it's nice to really take time away from the Vegas Strip to have a nice meal at a family oriented restaurant."}
{"text":"We go to egg works quite often and we always have a great experience. Amazing customer service from managers and servers. Veronica is very sweet and attentive and she is definitely one of the reasons we always go back :) -Quiersten and Ruben"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Egg Works. The wait on a Sunday  at noon wasn't too long...about 10-15 minutes. This time I wanted to try the Homemade Corned Beef and my food partner decided on the Country Fried Steak. With each entree, you can get toast or banana nut muffin. I was pleased with the banana nut muffin. When our entrees came, I was disappointed with the Corned Beef. It was dry and just not what I expected. It basically looked like the corned beef you get out of a can. The Country Fried Steak was good, but not blow your mind out of this world great. We ordered a large pancake on the side, but it was a bit rubbery too me and over buttery. However, the service was great.  Overall, it was worth it with our 2 for 1 coupon and for a close breakfast place to eat its convenient."}
{"text":"Don't Do it! I'll start by saying that I'm pretty easy to please when I'm starving. That being said, the food was mediocre at best.   I received spoiled OJ, my man got rancid water in a dirty cup. Water!  The server was very accommodating and replaced my spoiled juice with coffee and my mate' s nasty water with bottled. So far, so good, handled it well and didnt charge us for these, so i greatly appreciate their service.   The food, however, was not awesome. I ordered the Greek scramble and what i got was a grey, unappetizing mess loaded with some sort of pressed chicken thing. It was slimey, salty and I didnt love it. My man got mushy, NOT homemade corned beef hash which was also unimpressive. With enough hot sauce, the meal was tolerable. Best part was the side of fruit. Like I said, dont do it."}
{"text":"Not only as a keen observer, but also as an individual who has worked in the restaurant industry, I can confidently say this is one of my best breakfast experiences I've ever had. This can be attributed to the consistency of exemplary service (from all staff), and magnificently cooked food. Even when under pressure, and busy every server, and every manager will be there from beginning to end ensuring you have the best experience. I visit regularly now, and don't see that changing anytime in the future."}
{"text":"My buddy Sean referred me to this place. At first I was thinking probably your basic breakfast joint. But as I walked in I was greeted by someone extremely pleasant. The wait was literally minutes. The waitress was Nicole and I got to tell ya her customer service was  superb! She made sure we had all the things we need to have an enjoyable lunch. Not to mention she was always happy and smiling. Food? Omg. I was sampling everyone's dishes and I got to tell ya, you can't go wrong ordering anything here! Bandito scamble is amazing though wow! Overall, every time I come to las Vegas I am always visiting this place and making sure Nicole is there!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. It was super busy when I stopped in but they still had my to go order ready. I'll try it out a few more times."}
{"text":"They always offer great service and food when I come in to eat :) There is really no wait even during lunch hours, and the wait on food is not too long, so it is a perfect spot for lunch during work hours!"}
{"text":"Ran to my car for 2 mins, and they threw away my to-go box i had sitting on the table. When i went back in all the waiters just looked at me like 'oh shit' cause obviously they knew it was stupid to have thrown it away. Wasting food is a big ordeal to me so that extremely pissed me off. Why would you throw a to-go box away. Never coming back just because of the service."}
{"text":"I LOVE breakfast!!    And Egg Works is one of the few places you can get an authentic Hawaiian breakfast (rice, eggs & hamburger patty, spam or portuguese (WOW A+) sausage).  The banana nut muffin has a BIG top on it...the BEST part!!  Moist & fluffy towards the middle and nice crispy around the edges.  it's really more of a bran muffin than banana nut.  I'd call it a banana-nut infused bran muffin....except that'd be too pretentious for this casual joint.   I usually eat the top & leave the muffin.  We've been several times and there is almost always a wait...deal with it.  The food's worth the wait.  They hustle people through tho so we've never waited as long as they've estimated.  And if you're a party of 2, the bar at the back is great... the service is best there and it's not quite as noisy/crowded as the dining room where people are on all sides of you and servers are bustling around non-stop.  The bloody mary is ok, a little weak IMO, but for $6 go for it.    And I think the portions are HUGE.  Bring an appetite.    If they have the breakfast nachos on special, it sounds odd, but sister ordered them & said they were very yummy.   The stuffed french toast looks out of this world (& huge!), but I always order the Hawaiian...maybe one day."}
{"text":"We tried this place a few years ago and was disappointed and never went back until this week when we used a Groupon deal. We are glad we gave them another chance. Service was great. Love the fact that they leave you a pot of coffee on the table, no waiting for refills. They had french vanilla and irish cream creamers to choose from-another plus. I ordered the Veggie skillet-no spinach-extra mushrooms. It was really good and they used fresh mushrooms. Finding a good skillet is almost impossible here in Las Vegas. I will order this again. My Dad had the french toast  which he said was good.  Banana muffin was warmed a little too much, but still very good."}
{"text":"Came here w/ friends after the BADASS DASH. Starving and ready for some pancakes, a good sign of a great restaurant is a: full parking lot and a timely wait. We experienced both, what makes out better is that we're waiting to be seated and droves of people are still coming in to get a place in line.  Unfortunately we waited 45mins, I almost gave then a 3star rating for that alone but they redeemed themselves by giving our entire party of 9 muffins (free charge) before the even handed us our menus.  Service fast, customer service (GOOD) especially RACE DAY.  Egg Works got hit w/ a double dose of racers that day (BadAss Dash @ Southpoint and the COLOR RUN in henderson) and yes we all got in our cars for good pancakes.  I don't like to go against the grain when dealing w/ pancake establishments, I go for old faithful: FlapJacks, sausage and egg...hashbrown if i'm super hungry.  Food came to the table steaming hot.    BUTTERMILKE PANCAKES: nice and fluffy, kind of like an AIR fluffiness and BIG.  No sour after taste from the buttermilk, actually I could've ate the pancakes w/o the syrup.   Really though, who eats pancakes w/o syrup???? SHENANIGANS ok back to the air quality pancakes, the pancakes soak up the syrup UM YEA - DELICIOUS  EGGS and SAUSAGE: no big wow factor here, eggs NOT runny, good color, fluffy. (ok so i cannot stop using the word FLUFFY to describe this food) but the eggs WERE FLUFFY! ;-)  just a regular sausage pattie.  If I find myself on this side of town again around breakfast time, then I will definitely drop in for some PANCAKES.   FYI: NO SPLIT CHECK, if you're coming w/ a large group I suggest you come w/ CASH or designate that one CREDIT CARD person that will pay and then reimburse them.  TRY IT OUT, YOU'LL BE SURPRISED!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast / brunch spot. Love the newspaper menus, friendly service and egg-ceptional omelettes. Natasha, our waitress was friendly and attentive.  Not my first time here, will be coming again."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere.  Enjoyed the visit and the good customer service.  They have an egg place card you can flip if you need anything, which is a great idea.  Coffee is a little weak.  4 stars great place for breakfast.  Plus I used their wifi to post this."}
{"text":"I happened to go here and order some breakfast, let me tell you this, you def get your moneys worth. I ordered the Santa Cruz burrito, it is huge and fully loaded w/ egg and chorizo ( mexican sausage if you dont know) and a side of potatoes.   I also liked the enviorment too, the staff was friendly and helpful. I def recommend going there and I will for certainly be going back often. I enjoy places like this immensely."}
{"text":"Their country potatoes are flavorful and tasty. One dish of theirs would feed two average persons."}
{"text":"Just pulled into Vegas and found this wonderful place. Food was prepared quickly. It was delicious and more than I could eat. The banana nut muffin was the perfect starter. Blade was our server and she rocked it. On her game, friendly, informative and check on us often. (Hope you get your ears). I totally recommend this place. If I lived here I would eat here a couple of times a week."}
{"text":"EGG-cellent service, decent food, ok prices-a little EGG-spensive for what it was, horrible decor.  (A faux-farmer-interior designer threw up on the walls - but I give them props for attempting to be unique & creative.)  I might go back if I'm in the area and need a potato hashbrown thingey fix."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Corned Beef hash is the freshest I've ever had, bacon & onion skillet was perfect. Ask for the banana nut muffin grilled, tasty!"}
{"text":"Reliable breakfast spot but certainly nothing special.  Basic eggs bacon toast etc... I do think that some of their more \"fancy\" dishes with veggies, cheese actually lack the flavor that you'd expect from adding veggies and cheese.  Service here is usually pretty good so if you're looking for a basic breakfast spot this place will get the job done..."}
{"text":"Their potatoes & freshly baked banana nut muffin are crack. Coffee alone is excellent! Service is excellent as always! Portions are HUGE!! This place beats ihop/Denny's!!"}
{"text":"Basically the same food as the other locations. But it's a bigger place than the Flamingo location.  They don't offer specials yet cause it just opened 3 weeks ago and the chefs are still getting used to the menu.   We ordered the work omelette, pork chops and mine was the carnitas rancheros. All the food was awesome. I ordered 2 over easy eggs and they arrived over hard. Our server Kenneth immediately resolved it and brought me 2 over eggs. So I had a total of 4 eggs with breakfast.  All in all food, service and atmosphere was eggcellent!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in the entire Las Vegas-Henderson area...I've been coming here daily for a long time!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, thanks DARIA! She was very nice! Food is great. Best breakfast potatoes and banana nut muffin is delicious!"}
{"text":"Service is always bomb.com Donna rocked. She was on it. I'm usually not a fan of chain places but thus one keeps me coming back. I'm a regular."}
{"text":"Always consistent. My wife and I come often for breakfast and always leave satisfied. I love the skillets. Eggs, veggies, and potatoes all in one. Delicious. Ali was our server and did a great job. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Service was amazing!!! Food hit the spot! Shout out to our server Patrick and the Manger Trevor!!! The banana nut muffin was amazing least with 3 loafs!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place the full five stars!!! Fruit was fresh coffee was good eggs were perfectly cooked and dog friendly for Real nice big patio and great toast"}
{"text":"My regular: The Classic- 2 eggs, potatoes, toast and I order a side of turkey sausage.  The staff at this location is much younger, the hipster kind and they are quite friendly. Even the clientele is much younger. My food is consistently prepared and my experience dining here is always a positive one.   Two thumbs up, way up!!"}
{"text":"I don't eat breakfast all the time but this is one of the few breakfast places that I like. The portions are big and service is great.   The barn-like decor, with some farm animals, and egg people on the walls are real cute. The menu is presented different, it's printed on a newspaper type layout and there are little egg people all over that too. Cute.  My regular meal of choice: the waffles and sausage patties with an iced tea (fresh brewed). My husband usually gets an omelet (egg whites) and potatoes. I love the waffles, you get 1 large waffle, light and sweet. The Patties are good too. And there's always enough potatoes on my husband's plate, that I'm able to have some too. I like them because they've some kind of Cajun seasoning on them.   If you need anything from the server, there's an egg shaped sign on the table and if you need assistance, you flip the black egg over so that the yellow egg is showing and a majority of the time, a server instantly shows up to assist you, whether they're your server or not. It's interesting, and I hope I don't jinx myself by saying this, but we've been going there for about 3 years or so, maybe once every couple months, and there has not been a time when the service was bad for us. The only thing that I'm not a fan of, is the long wait that you have to deal with sometimes, especially on a Sun or Sat and the parking is poop when it's busy.   Yes, I'd go back and we do quite often."}
{"text":"Came to LV on vacation from Florida. This place is the BOMB!! Great food and service."}
{"text":"I love their omelettes and scrambles. This time I had the greek scramble and the other guest had the works scramble. Would recommend those for sure. Oh and don't skip the seasoned potatoes - they are delicious! They serve good coffee too and the service is very quick!"}
{"text":"Great family atmosphere! I've come down to this fine establishment with the family and also with co-workers during he lunch time hour and their service never ceases to amaze me. The food is great and good portions. They have plenty of options for breakfast lovers. They also have a Hawaiian option which was a nice treat. You get a muffin if it's your first visit make sure you let them know!   My only gripe with this place is that they don't split the bill or give you separate checks."}
{"text":"Thanks for the great service Tanya! First time in only a fifteen minute wait, yummy food! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Great service and perfect breakfast every time. Grandmas biscuits and gravy are the best around. Coffee is tasty too! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's only open for breakfast and lunch but they do a great job on breakfast. This is 1 of the few places I go to where I always get something different and it's always very good.   Today I ordered the breakfast burrito and the Mrs. ordered the Reuben. Both very good."}
{"text":"The greatest breakfast on the planet! The potato's are great!"}
{"text":"Immediately greeted and seated by super friendly James. He promptly took our drink order and returned quickly. I didn't find what I was looking for on the menu so he help me create my own omelet.. The BF got a delicious spicy Bloody Mary and I opted for green tea which was served with a full carafe of hot water lemon and honey. We got hot delicious banana nut muffins with our check-in. Update: Back for a late breakfast..perfect for rainy day pick me up. Dennis promptly took our drink order I ordered the Mexican omelet with a lot of mods.  He wrote them all with a smile. The order came back perfect. I go into it too fast to even take a picture! The omelette was perfectly cooked with carnitas jalapenos and veggies. Spicy sauce on top was perfect. It was nice to get real slices of fruit instead of fruit cocktail! The boyfriend mentioned that he wanted to try the Cincy chili. He ordered it to go but Dennis  suggested that he try a sample first. Now that is great customer service!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness . My brother in law and I sat at the bar and the food was DELIIIIIISH as always !!! Blade was our waitress and let me just say she is amazing she was busy and you would have never known it based on her uplifting, upbeat attitude . she is so sweet and just has this bright light around her. While we were sitting there we saw some customers being so rude and impatient to the staff when CLEARLY they were all busy. I did not see one person just stand around. Thank you Blade for the great experience. Thank you to the rest of the egg works team for being so accommodating and very nice you are all the real MVP's  Oh & shout out to the cooks thanks for awesome food"}
{"text":"Coming here every Wednesday has now become a routine since John and I are off together on that day. I look forward to it every week before our hikes or errand runs.   The restaurant is clean and well kept, except for the occasional baby in a high chair who drops food all over the floor. That just shows bad parenting but that's a whole different topic. We are always seated promptly and our drinks are at our table before we even have a chance to look at the menu. Our server has been Jill and she's awesome. She noticed John was wearing an A's baseball hat and instantly was able to strike up a conversation with us. She has remembered us and is friendly every time. Thanks Jill!!   The food is pretty good. Typical breakfast joint. I always get the eggs Benedict with hollandaise sauce on the side. I don't like the muffin underneath to be soggy so I just like to dip instead. So good and fulfilling. The omelettes are also very good. Huge and stuffed with anything and everything you can imagine. And everything is reasonably priced. They also offer lunch  options. Depending on what you order, you're looking at about $25 for two people.   Will I be back? Definitely, every Wednesday!!"}
{"text":"This place is on point. Coming from Pittsburgh where they have some really great breakfast spots, to the city where it's more industrialized , this place has great quality breakfast with great prices. This place is friendly and when you are inside it feels like your outside the city. Hope those of you who visit this place enjoy it."}
{"text":"Our server Brady at this location went above and beyond.  He was very attentive and prompt.  He even gave us banana bread since it was our first visit.  He was on top of everything!  Even gave me my to go box done I forgot it at the table while paying to leave.  I orders the bloody Mary and prime rib benedict. The bloody mary came in a cute little mason jar.  I loved the entree I ordered.  Overall the expedience we had with our server made this place great.  Food was okay,  will have to come back to try more items!"}
{"text":"CANDICE is hands down one of the sweetest most attentive servers I have ever had at egg works. Great job on the hiring. Thank you for serving us this morning we will definitely be back to see Candice and have some amazing muffins!"}
{"text":"Always amazing food and Gabriel was awesome!!! Couldn't ask for better service  Ask to sit in his section when you come in, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice place but . . , I ordered the two fried eggs and potatoes.  Basic stuff, but the potatoes almost seemed deep fried and were way over spiced.  The spice dominated the entire breakfast it was so strong.  The egg was not cooked properly.  I asked for whites cooked, yoke runny, but both the yoke and whites were runny.  Charged an extra $1.75 for about 15 blue berries in son's pancake, which seemed excessive.   My wife was with me and liked her omelet, which looked good.    Coffee was good and pot was left at table which is nice.  I like the location.  We sat inside and it was not too loud.  No wait."}
{"text":"Rob. Rob. Rob.  Plus all the servers!  Rob.  What a Great guy, Great Server, Great personality, Great worker!  All the servers are good.  Rob.  The food is very tasty.  Rob.  :-)"}
{"text":"Rossy was great! Food was awesome! Will be back for sure! Not to long of a wait even tho it was sat!"}
{"text":"Love the ciabatta breakfast sandwich! Also Sarah was very friendly and nice! The staff is always friendly and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Veronica just served my friend and I. She was a rockstar! Very pleasant and even let us use her favorite purple pen. I absolutely loved the waffles and they have the best eggs Benedict on the planet."}
{"text":"I went here this morning about 8 a.m. and there were very few people there. However when we walked through the door there were several parties waiting to be seated and there was some confusion as the hostess was taking all the parties name down but not seating anyone.  It was awkward and everyone was standing around for no reason. The vibe was not  welcoming at all. We ordered  the classic bacon and eggs, easy enough, but noooo.... my order was incorrect and had to be corrected. The food was luke warm and basically  boring. We finished and went pay our bill and there  was another line to pay, they only have one  cash register  but 2 people standing there. This place is off my list, i won't  be going back there."}
{"text":"I have waited until I've had three bad experiences at this location, and yesterday was it. We went on Sunday for my partner's birthday, and waited 30 mins for a table outside, although there was only one other couple on the outdoor patio at the time (8 tables outside).   When we were seated, another 10 mins before a waitress asked for our drink order. That took another 20 minutes for coffee to arrive (without cream/sugar).   When we ordered our drinks, we shared our fabulous YELP checkin bonus of a free muffin. When the coffee and orange juices came out, there was no muffin. We reminded the waitress of the muffins, and she came back with one of the two muffins, and no butter, about 13 mins after we reminded her (yes, we'd started a clock at this point).  We reminded her we had two checkin muffins, so she went for the other muffin.  17 minutes after that (now we're 1 hour, 17 minutes into our visit), she brings out the other muffin and wants to take our order.  We explained we just wanted the bill, and we'd go to a different Eggworks.  We waited 7 minutes for the bill to arrive and then deposited $5 on the table and left. The manager followed us out to the parking lot and offered us a coupon for \"Buy one, get half-off the second meal.\"   This particular location has been nose-diving since November of 2017; I doubt we'll ever return. This location went through a period last fall where the potatos were drowning in heavy spice and other condiments, to the explanation of \"Our owner likes it spicy, so he insists we deliver it that way.\" odd that other locations weren't like that. The location on Eastern is much, much better, the staff is better, parking is harder, but we've never had ridiculous waits, never had bad service, and always very much enjoyed the experience there. 30 mins further from our home, but well worth the extra drive on a Sunday morning where relaxation is the goal."}
{"text":"Easily my fave breakfast place in Vegas. Always get the banana muffin starter. It's free if you check in on Yelp!"}
{"text":"Love the one on Eastern; we visit here often.  Be sure to check Yelp for the free muffin offer with a check-in.  The location on Sunset is their least-desirable location. My faves are Eastern Buffalo Sahara  LOVE their omelettes!!"}
{"text":"Its alright. Good service. Food is well prepared but nothing great in my opinion. Worth the price but probably wouldnt go back."}
{"text":"Bambi was great, she took care of our party of 8, very attentive.  Our breakfast was awesome."}
{"text":"Very fulfilling breakfast spot. Had the very filling Country Benny. I asked and was given one of their famous banana nut muffins. It did not appear as a charge on my bill. I recommend this place for breakfast. I'd like to try the other menu choices but I fly out of the area tonight. If this place was in New York, I'd go.  Oh, my server Eden was perfectly attentive, meaning, he checked in on me but not too often to the point where it disrupts your meal. Thanks Eden. I hope you get the trip to Disneyland."}
{"text":"My first time at egg works, food was interesting and tasty.  Waiter was amazing.  My server PK was great with his suggestions."}
{"text":"It's great. I dont think you can really mess up breakfast food. I they have pretty fast service too."}
{"text":"You need to try their skillets. They are sooo good and very filling. I love the Santa Cruz one and the one with chorizo, can't remember the name."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is always consistent and the staff is always friendly. The very veggie eggs Benedict is fantastic. Even when there's a wait it's worth it. I'm happy they are here in Summerlin"}
{"text":"Awesome as hell big menu great choices and they have mimosas and bloody Mary's as well as coffee drinks with liquor ... Second time here I will be back"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast food! We ate outside on the dog friendly patio. The skillets were amazing. Service fantastic... the waiter left each of us our own carafe of drinks"}
{"text":"Amy our server was exceptional! The western omelette was great. The potatoes were fantastic! The banana nut muffin was still warm - hard to beat. Corn beef was pretty heavily seasoned but didn't come out of a can so that was a plus. We would go back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Robert our waiter, was excellent! We had to wait a long time for our food, the cooks made a mistake with our order, but Robert took great care in informing us about our order. Thank you Robert, for being on top of things!"}
{"text":"Egg works is amazing place to eat a healthy breakfast!! Great protein portions. I'm definitely a regular here and would like to give them some credit..The staff is amazing and attentive. Most likely come here after a good workout session!"}
{"text":"Cuisine was above outstanding. The atmosphere was very homie and the service was right on spot. Eden was our server and was very attentive.  We had the bacon avacado omelet and the chili rellano omelet. The portion was huge, each plate was big enough for two people.  The potatoes were seasoned perfectly, no ketchup required. We would recommend trying the Habla Diablo chili, it is great. This will be our breakfast place when we vacation to Las Vegas in the future."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time to try it out. I've got to say it was fantastic, my waiter Dennis was super helpful and the food was super. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I wanted pancakes so we went here. Good was bomb. But service was ok- maybe we had to use the forest gump method to get our servers attention, but I didn't like how they gave us the bill before asking if we needed anything else. Well come back to this location even though it felt like we were being rushed out."}
{"text":"Our family LOVES Egg Works.  We come here about 3 times a month, always Sunday mornings.    The food is always good and hot, and our order is never screwed up.   The staff is nice.  The service is fast.  The prices are decent and the portions are big.  We've even had 2 small private parties here- my baby shower, and my sister-in-laws graduation party.  The price was great and so was the service.    Definitely a place to try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Very good service. The portions were large. The California crepe was very good but my favorite is the Sunrise Mountain. Amanda provided excellent service and was very friendly."}
{"text":"food: chicken fried steak. it's one of my favorite items to order at a diner and this place nailed it. the sauce was excellent and the chicken was crispy. however, i dont care for home fries as much, but it worked. ***4/5  service: typical diner service. it was busy and looks like a lot of locals are around. our server was attentive and got our orders fairly quick. ***4/5  value: the plate is huge. plenty of food for the price. being breakfast, i was able to clean the plate. ***4/5"}
{"text":"This places atmosphere is really cozy and the food is really great, especially the banana nut muffins. The menu is humongous and I couldn't even decide what to get. Blade was the nicest person ever, I didn't know people could be so happy! If you are in the Las Vegas area definitely drop by this place."}
{"text":"VERY good breakfast place! We have been going here for a while now and it is probably one of the best places in Las Vegas for good breakfast. The staff is great, friendly, and nice. The food is always hot and comes out pretty quick."}
{"text":"A GREAT Breakfast place, sometimes we do get crappy customer service from the servers, but the food is always great. I think they also could use another way to pay for meals, sometimes the line to leave is so long it takes 10-15 min just to get up to pay for your meal."}
{"text":"This place gets a 5-star review not because it is high end and swanky, but because they are crushed every single day with breakfast and brunch and the service, food, and drinks are always ultra consistent. There is almost always a wait on the weekends but you can try your luck sitting at the bar in the back. Servers are always prompt and aware even with 4-6 table sections. Only negative, which is not the restaurant's fault, is you can almost always count on a little rug-rat sprinting around the place with no parental units to be found. There's nothing worse than trying to enjoy your bloody mary on Sunday while a 5 year old knocks into your table. Green chili pork carnitas with an egg over easy and eggs benedict are both a must. Will always be back here."}
{"text":"First time here, large menu.   Great service,  Ashley asked me if I had been there before, I replied no and before I knew it she had a fantastic banana muffin on a plate in front of me.  I asked her what I should have and she ordered me a carnitas omelet.  It hit the spot.   Thanks Ashley!"}
{"text":"What a great place to eat, our server ROSSY was the best, what nice combination good food and amazing service.  Try biscuits and gravy,  loco moco and the banana muffin!!!!! What else can u ask for."}
{"text":"Sophie our server was great, food is fast and good we like this spot for a quiet Sunday brunch"}
{"text":"Love love love this Egg Works.  So nice that they have a special area where people with Dogs can sit. (outside)  Those who don't like dogs can sit inside in the air conditioning. My dog however is a service dog and can go either place, but I'm happy for the patio as some people, even though she is a service animal get upset when she is \"anywhere\" they are. FYI, Service Animals do not have to wear vests or any kind of ID, so you never know when a dog near you is actually a service animal, although the \"handlers/owners\" do have to carry a handlers ID. Some management ask to see it, some don't, but I always have mine in clear view.  This being said:  Egg Works is Amazing.  Everything I have ever ordered there has been perfect and very delicious. The prices are comparable to other breakfast places in the area.  I can't wait to go back.  The location is somewhat hard to find, but there is an IHop and a Starbucks within eyesight of the patio.  So I guess it gets lots of traffic?   This location used  to be an awesome Korean Restaurant.  Don't know what happened to it, but we ate there all the time.   I highly recommend this Egg Works, and if you don't like dogs...sit inside. :-)"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast. Staff is always friendly and food is great."}
{"text":"Donna was great! We had a special situation and she took care of us without a problem. Best service ever!!!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this highly rated breakfast spot in Vegas. They have 6 locations in Vegas which tells you how popular it is.   1) Ensenada Burrito: this was good buy would've been better if the carnitas were chunky instead of pulled pork consistency. The diablo potatoes are yummy! The seasoning reminds me of curly fries.  2) Corned Beef Hash: this was typical and nothing special.   3) Banana nut muffin: comes as an option on some of the breakfasts. If not, you can also get one free with Yelp Check in. Despite all the rave reviews, I wasn't super impressed. The only thing that was unique about this was  the muffin was like a cross between a banana nut muffin and a bran muffin."}
{"text":"Love the muffins and the relaxed feel of the place. It's on the short list for great eats for sure. Food always pleases."}
{"text":"Let me just say how in love I am with this place. Not only is this place conveniently located up the street from me, they actually serve delicious food.  I came back here multiple times and tried out different things off of there menu.    Upon arrival I was seated in no time which I am always a fan off.  After taking a seat, not only was my drink order taken but so was my order.  I always research what I want to eat before actually going to a restaurant.  I was also pleased with their website, offering an online menu.  It just makes things super fast for me.  Within the last few weeks of being here, I've tried their canadian bacon eggs benedict, prime rib eggs benedict, and the crepe omelete.  All of the above were delicious and saucy, the potatoes were to a crisp and they were spiced up perfectly.    My orders came in a timely fashion and I always pay the right amount.  A well done deal for such a tasty place. If you're in the neighborhood check them out, because dammmnnn they are tasty!"}
{"text":"So good. Highly recommended. Plenty of food and great service. We will be coming back. We had a large group and ordered different stuff from the menu. The omelets were big, the potatoes were nicely seasoned, the pancakes were nice and fluffy, the coffee was hot, the toast was fresh and the service was spot on."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! It was busy. Great service. except that we waited the longest for our food, turns out it was sitting on the counter ready to be served but our waitress forgot about us. Its ok... she was nice."}
{"text":"I wish I knew what everybody likes about this place.  Second time was as bad as the first time.  But it will likely be my last time.  The food is mediocre and the service is way below par.  I waited a good ten minutes before a waitress came by to tell me she would be right back to take my order.  5 minutes later she came by.  Coffee cup was filthy.  The overall experience was just lousy."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Everything tastes great. Always fresh. Service is good. Great place to bring your out of town guests.   The Eggs Benny's any variety are awesome. One of my favorites.  I try to have something different with every visit. And so far and so good."}
{"text":"It's been sooo long since I've eaten here but man it feels good to be back. I ate the sunrise mountain and also got their delicious banana nut muffin! Our server was Marlene and she's the best server I've ever been served by....y'all should give her a raise."}
{"text":"Superior service. We called in an order at the wrong location, walked into this one, and realized our mistake. They rushed our order for us and we were out in 10 minutes. The food is also delicious; eggs benny, country benny, whatever benny, all of them are good. Their potatoes are seasoned just right and they give you a huge pile of it.  The only annoyance we experienced was during the American Express Small Business week where we ordered and tried to pay with American Express only to be told they no longer accepted it. Their restaurant was still listed on the Amex site and they made no effort to rectify this."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!! The artichoke, feta, mushroom omelette is out of this world and has such good flavor."}
{"text":"Pk was great and food and service top drawer. Try to go  once a week.  Such nice place"}
{"text":"Only been here for breakfast, but we keep coming back! Great food, great service!  Can get busy on weekends, FYI :-)"}
{"text":"In Vegas for The Weeknd concert and found delicious place on a Yelp. Melinda was our waitress and was really nice & helpful. Food was great, we had country fried steak & eggs."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. The restaurant felt more like a cafeteria then a restaurant. Wait staff was friendly."}
{"text":"The service was a little slow but they were busy. Cute theme. W were originally going to egg and I but they were temporarily closed so they sent us here with a couple coupons. Breakfast.was good and it was affordable. We would go back"}
{"text":"Brady the waiter had excellent customer service , always checked up on us, very friendly even though there was a bunch of us at the table he kept his composure. Overall just excellent customer service"}
{"text":"Enjoyed an Eggsellent breakfast here! I had Grandma's biscuits and gravy with 2 eggs, sausage pattys, and potatoes topped with gravy as well.  Armi had the bacon avocado omelette. The biscuits and gravy was one of the best ever. Biscuits were light and fluffy and the sausage gravy was so good. I think the gravy would taste good on anything...maybe even ice cream.   The waiter was very attentive and friendly.  He offered a banana nut muffin on the House and it was killer.  He was back with our order in about 5 minutes...talk about fast, huh!  We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! This is an awesome restaurant.  Try any of the skillets. In fact, everything is good.   It's always busy every single day."}
{"text":"Decor was a little weird but I got an amazing eggs Benedict, one of the best I've ever had. I'm often disappointed by breakfast potatoes but these ones were good and came for free with my meal. The service was great! Very attentive and didn't rush us out."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Thank you to our server Manuela, for the suggestion on what skillet to order, it was fantastic! Your fast service and friendly conversation really made our morning.  We will be back:)"}
{"text":"My friend took me when I was visiting in town. I ordered the country benny, which was just good. I loved the seasoned fries but I was going crazy about was the banana nut muffin!!!!!! Everyone on yelp was raving about it so I had to try, and NOW I know now! Their Bloody Mary was also amazing too!"}
{"text":"Service and food deserves 5 stars!  Parents approved.  Our server Dolly was a doll! She brought us out 2 extra banana nut muffins on the house for no reason. We must have been some good lookin' customers!! Just kidding =P  Omelette's are never a bad choice here no matter which one you select of you love eggs. All come with cajun potatoes and your choice of toast or banana but muffin (go with the muffin if you haven't tried it already and thank me later)!  Order from their specials board located in the waiting room! There's a reason they're special :)  We had several different staff members come to ask if everything was okay, not just our server."}
{"text":"Great food! Came out nice and hot and was very tasty.  Try the blackened prime rib skillet yum Our server Victoria was super friendly and funny. Thank you for the attentive service Victoria  we will definitely return to this location."}
{"text":"Our server Twila was awesome! Attentive, sweet, and just delightful. Atmosphere is family friendly, portions are big, menu is substantial without being overwhelming. I got the French Toast works with cinnamon raisin bread, scrambled eggs, and sausage links. My husband had the Sunrise: egg bacon scramble over croissants with fresh fruit. Yum!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken fried steak with eggs up and biscuits.  The steaks batter has a good seasoning on it and was fork tender.  The potatoes are coated with the Egg Works seasoning that they sell in jars.  The potatoes are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The biscuit was the star of the show today.  Soft and flaky, but not dry.  The real butter is served in small individual plastic tubs that sit on the table, so they are room temp and the butter just acts like a frosting on the biscuit.  Excellent breakfast.  The staff is very friendly and they know how to serve breakfast professionally.  I can see why there are 4-5 of these places in Vegas and they are all packed with customers."}
{"text":"A well oiled machine is the headline to this story.  I sat at the counter and ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with Biscuits and Gravy.  I brought a book to read, but I was entertained by the staff's efficiency working a busy holiday monday.  If you want to open a diner and want to get an idea how to do things, come here at have a meal and observe.  Without boring you with the details, the pass through window was an symphony between the cooks and the servers.  Good communication and everyone knows what needs to be done (busy work) to keep things running smooth.  There is also a good quality control.  Several times, a manager asked to have items replated because the presentation wasn't to her standard.  In some cases, food was discarded and re-done.  The Quality of service was a big reason for 5 stars.  Now, to the food.  It was good.  My CFS was a deep fried variety.  The quest to find a pan fried CFS like Eat At Joe's in Redondo Beach, CA. is hard to find.  It was a good steak.  Seasoned well.  The home fries are also deep fried.  Crispy.  I personally prefer grilled home fries with some onion and bellpepper.  The biscuit was a bit dry.  So, my meal was just okay.  The other food I saw looked good.  I would come back and try the Corned Beef Hash."}
{"text":"Veronica was Amazing!! Lightning fast service!!  Try the crepes they are really yummy!!  They'd find are to die for especially with the biscuits and gravy... Also the eggs been is better than most.. Even on Sunday when they are super busy .. The service is fast!!"}
{"text":"1145am on a Saturday, party of 2. Ordered a cup of coffee that never came but that I was billed for. (Server apologized for not bringing the coffee, but then still charged me.) Ordered the Veggie omelette with egg whites  instead got the Greek Scramble, because the server thought thats what I meant because my Mom ordered the Greek Scramble (Huh??) Asked for the coffee charge to be removed at the cashier's stand, and ate the wrong meal rather then wait for the correct one to be made. Don't think we'll be back, but they wont miss our business because there aren't many sit-down spots in that area.  Nobody's perfect."}
{"text":"Egg works is hands down my favorite breakfast spot ever. I've gone to every breakfast place in vegas but nothing compares to my avocado bacon omelette and banana muffin. I also love it because they do half orders which is the perfect portion for me."}
{"text":"We were a party of 4. We had their traditional eggs Benedict, the vegetarian eggs Benedict, the French toast with strawberries, and the plain French toast.  my eggs benny veggie was awesome English muffin fresh sauce really good the French toast is a big portion and I was with small eater so they could have shared an order.  Service was really good and prices were reasonable really reasonable this place was busy and you can see why. Highly recommend it for breakfast"}
{"text":"This was my first time here! We will be back!   We had the best waiter PK!   He was very friendly, helpful with the menu and answered all our questions with a smile!  He made our breakfast experience memorable!   Thanks PK we will be back for sure!   If you eat here i would sit in his section!"}
{"text":"Nick was an excellent server this morning for breakfast. It was our first time here. The banana nut muffin was delicious. The food was amazing and portion sizes are nice and big. We are new to the area and love breakfast, so will be returning for breakfast again!"}
{"text":"Came to egg works with a Groupon. Get their geoupon! Worth the deal. We paid 26 for $40 worth of food.    I got the crazy chicken and my husband got the Brad's scramble. If you are a coffee seinker they offer flavor creamer BTW.  The crazy chicken at this location is more cheesy than the other locations. Mine was loaded with cheese and even had cheese falling odd the omelette. What I also noticed was they put probably half an advocado in there. I'm not complaining because it was so good.  They do offer an egf white version for an extra $0.95.  Note' the omelette is huge. Definitely a shareable dish. The crazy chicken has adovcado, cheese, chicken, and mushrooms and a dap of sour cream. Take each bite with sour cream and it'll taste even better than ketchup.  My husband got the Brad's scramble. He stated that it was also too cheesy. Although he took off most of the cheese he really liked it. The brans scramble has no meat. Very vegetarian friendly.   Both dishses came with a side of potatoes and banana bread. Get the BANANA bread. And eat it with their soft butter. If you had to get one thing, just get the banana bread. If you check in, you'll get a free one. The potatoes has its own seasoning. It kinda taste like seasoning salt bit better. If you like it, they also sell it.   This location is located next to a McDonald's and a large shopping cennter. Good luck trying to find parking in front or on side of the restaurant. The complex connected to it has plenty of parking and it's a short walk.   Pricing here is decent for the amount of food you get. But it's cheaper with the Groupon."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin. Egg works became my new favorite breakfast spot, over the course of one morning! The food is delicious. I ordered scrambled eggs with potatoes and bacon and their potatoes are beyond words! So delicious! However, the best part of our experience was our waitress Thai. She was so friendly and knowledgable and made our experience memorable, to say the least. We we're visiting from out of town, so she let us try the banana muffins and those things are HEAVENLY! Make sure you try them, they are unlike any other muffins you've ever tasted. So overall, I will return to egg works again. The staff is amazing, food is delicious and prices are fair! And give Thai a raise! ;)"}
{"text":"Every time we come to Vegas we hit up egg works. It was even better this morning because Amy L. Was our server. She got to be the best one yet. Glad we selected this location."}
{"text":"I had the Loco Moco, not bad but, nothing like homegrown local Hawaii Loco Moco.  They use brown gravy (that tastes like it came out of a mix) instead of homemade gravy.   The banana muffin was yummy, moist w/a lot of flavor. This is my second time here, it's a darling place w/outdoor sitting and a Cho Cho train that goes around n around above r heads. The food overall is ok, next time I'll try the sandwiches.  The sandwiches look great, they're packed w/a lot of meat n cheese n tomatoes, etc. Samantha was sweet, got r food out as promptly as she could, kept checking back on us... Overall, it's ok but, will be back to try the sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love eggs. I love eggs any and every way and was happy that my husband found Egg Works on Yelp and brought me here when we visited Vegas!  This is definitely a little off the strip and mostly for locals but I highly recommend you stop by if you're looking for a good breakfast that will fill you up for the rest of the day!  I ordered an omelet and my husband ordered a crepe. It came with their Diablo Potatoes and I have to say that it is the most delicious breakfast potatoes I have ever had! They were crispy and perfectly seasoned and I would come back just to get an order of them! The omelet was pretty good and my husband enjoyed his crepe.  What's neat about this place is that the menu is a newspaper so it gives you the whole breakfast experience! Also, the tables have a little flipcard stand where you can flip the card over when you want your server to assist you- this is super efficient because the restaurant is super busy!  I highly recommend and will be back next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I expected a long wait since it seemed very popular and the parking lot has always been crowded, but I was definitely pleasantly surprised that we were seated promptly! 5 stars for the service, it was really good. The food was meh at best, however. There were random pieces of food thrown in my skillet that were not supposed to be there, my toast came out deformed and soggy while my friend's toast was burnt to a crisp. The skillet I ordered was alright, nothing great. Potatoes were good, the spinach and mushrooms were uncooked and annoying to eat, seemed like a rushed job. My friend ordered corn beef hash and he did not really love his either, ate only a few bites. Good thing the items were not very expensive. Probably will not be back, there are definitely better breakfast spots in the Anthem area!"}
{"text":"The food is good here, but I'm mainly writing this because of the service. I've never been to a place that I thought was being run as efficiently as possible until this restaurant.   On a Sunday morning we waited about 20 minutes for a table, but once you get your table they really keep things moving. Our waiter took our drink orders right away and returned with them quickly. We ordered and again our waiter returned ridiculously fast with our pre-breakfast muffins. We barely had time to finish our muffins when breakfast arrived. While we were eating I saw the staff turn a table after a large party left like a Nascar pit crew. The whole staff really hustles in the morning.  The actual menu is huge. They have everything from unique scrambles to pancakes to benedicts. The muffins they bring before the meal are both delicious and moist. I had the mashed potato omelet which has mashed potatoes, bacon, cheese, onions, and sour cream. It was yummy, but not the most exciting option they offer. My husband had the chili omelet with chili and cheese. This was definitely even better than my omelet very tasty.  This is a good spot if you like a hearty breakfast with unique options."}
{"text":"We had a nice breakfast. This location is a large place and it was packer but we didn't need to wait for a table. Our waitress Carly must be the happiest person on the face of the earth.   I had the bacon avocado omelet. It was one of the better omelets a I have had in Las Vegas. The bacon and avocado were actually inside the omelet and not just placed on top.  Potatoes were a little over seasoned for my liking but my husband seemed to enjoy them."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast in Las Vegas. The mimosas are great and the food is good and you get huge portions. The wait can be long sometimes but if you go early it's not too bad."}
{"text":"I've been to a different Egg Works location, but this one is definitely better.   Good food and good service from Dolly. Split an omelette + extra potatoes with mi amor, and it was excellent. You can taste all the ingredients and it wasn't super oily.   The banana muffin was also tasty. Definitely opt for that instead of toast, unless you really want toast.   Whatever seasoning they use on those potatoes were super tasty, didn't want to stop eating them!  Will have to come back if we're in the area again."}
{"text":"Our server Char took care of us really well. Very attentive and she was really nice. Our food also arrived promptly. There was a little hiccup at the beginning but her attentiveness as well as the bus person's more than made up for everything.  I don't know why it took us so long to eat at this place. Will definitely be back! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The breakfast is the best and the banana nut muffins are a must try!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place. Their homemade corned beef hash is bomb! Great place to have brunch with family and friends. The place is located at Eastern and dining out feels like ur in Cali."}
{"text":"Every time Jim and I come to Las Vegas we have breakfast at least once at Egg Works. Today was not a disappointment it was excellent as always! I had the stuffed French Toast for the first time and it was amazing. Jim had the Denver omelette which is a good standard. The banana nut muffins we took to go for later and they are wonderful. Chelsea was our server and gave us impeccable service.  We love that you get a coffee pot when you order coffee so doesn't run out plus l love to use the flavored coffee creamers a real treat with all the flavor's they offer. All in all a wonderful breakfast experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Egg Works offers EVERY breakfast item my  little heart desires. From eggs benedict, French toast, loco mocos, skillets, omelettes, and more. I'm soo indecisive when it comes to picking food that it took me a good while to figure out what I wanted.  I ended up getting the Country Style Eggs Benedict. It comes with 2 biscuits, sausage patty, smothered with country gravy, and topped with 2 eggs cooked to your liking and a side of Works potatoes, a slice of grapefruit and pineapple.  - the country gravy was a little too salty for my taste, so I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. The potatoes were cooked perfectly, nice and crispy with a touch of paprika.   I also got to try the Stuffed French Toast. This was AHH-MAYZING! Gooey cheese, egg, and sausage sandwiched between two pieces of French toast. Drizzle the maple syrup on top, and voila! Thee perfect breakfast! It also comes with a side of Works potatoes. I'll be back for this next time.   *Coffee is all you can drink! And if you don't like non dairy creamer, you can ask for half & half :)"}
{"text":"The is a great place to eat. Only open for breakfast and lunch. The Banana Nut Muffin is a must and comes with most breakfast specials. My go to is the Stuffed French Toast. but the pancakes are very tasty as well and dont forget the potatoes i like them cooked well done. Its about a 15 min drive from the strip but well worth it and not over priced. I have visited this location at least 5 times. i go every time i'm in Vegas. Cant wait for my next trip"}
{"text":"The food is good, wide variety and large portions but also, large cost.  I wish they had smaller, cheaper options for seniors on a budget or maybe some early bird specials."}
{"text":"Good food and really large portion sizes. My party and I didn't allot enough time to sit and eat it all but it probably still would have been too much for me to finish. I had the bacon and onion skillet which was delicious. It comes served on top of seasoned potatoes and topped with eggs done how you like them. It's a good value for the amount of food you get but it would be better if they could sell you less food for an even cheaper price (not that it's very expensive at all). I just feel like it's sort of wasteful as no one was able to finish their food."}
{"text":"Saturday morning this place was slammed!   Host told us 10-15 minute wait and she was true to that statement.   We got seated with a greeting and a smile and right away the busser asked the kids what they wanted to drink cause he saw they were getting fidgety.  Awesome customer service from everyone!   Hats off to the management for hiring upbeat and hard working employees who get what customer service is all about!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late breakfast with the wifey. We came after the breakfast rush and were seated right away. Most of the breakfast places we eat at out here are usually pretty good and consistent and this place did not disappoint. Everything was cooked well and seasoned well. I ordered the country fried steak and the wife ordered the corn beef hash. Both meals were really good. I like the variety of hot sauces. The service was great and we enjoyed our late breakfast. I will return for sure."}
{"text":"I had 'The Works' omelette this morning. If your into a lot of eggs filled with lots of good meats and cheese, this ones for you."}
{"text":"The potatoes here are addictive! The seasoning on it reminds me of doritos chips, maybe that's their secret flavor! The waffles are like Chinese eggette desserts - very fluffy. I always get the veggie omelet which is always 2x more food then I can devour, but is delicious, fresh and gets my day going. My friends have tried some of the skillet items and other omelets (such as \"the works\") and they weren't as satisfied with those. The prime rib benny (grilled croissant with blackened prime rib) is really good too or the corn beef hash if you want something heavier.   Wait time on a Saturday morning (~10am) was about 20-30 minutes."}
{"text":"Omg the food is amazing , what a way to wake up in the morning and put a smile on our faces. The banana nut muffin wow so delicious very moist , my santa Cruz skillet was very flavorful A MUST TRY. Our server Carolline was awesome we never had to ask for anything , drinks were always full , always had enough napkins which is annoying to me when servers give you like 2 napkins for the whole table , it's like when I say can i have extra napkins GIVE ME EXTRA NAPKINS, but we didn't have to ask she automatically did it, food came out fast and she made us feel very warm and welcome . Definitely would sit at Carollines table again, thank you egg works for a awesome time and definitely we will be back for more great food"}
{"text":"We tried Egg Works for the first time today and we'll definitely be back. Our amazing server, Ashley was amazing right from the start. She brought out these warm and delicious banana nut muffins to start our day.  Her menu suggestions were on point and the food was big and classic American! We live on the strip so Egg Works was a breath of fresh air from the high priced and minimalist breakfast dishes we're used to! Big thanks again to Ashley for making our breakfast so great. She's mine and my wife's favorite server in all of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"All I hoped it would be.... :) Came with my husband... No wait, nice server, food came fast.... Was delicious and huge portions. I'll be back for sure. Especially because there were about 10 things I wanted and finally decided on the country Benny. I wasn't disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Our server Rob today was outstanding! He truly knows service and he was so helpful. He was attentive and just genuinely friendly. Ask to be seated in Rob's section cause he knows service!"}
{"text":"This  place is a great bang for the buck breakfast joint,, it's Eggcellent ! Try the muffins !!!"}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict is so good, as is everything we have tried.  Banana muffin is unbelievable good, always.  Great place for breakfast or lunch.  Great food and nice and clean.  MAnager MARYANN runs this place like it's her home and we are all family.  We three sisters had a million questions for her and she gave us all the answers even though there was not an empty seat!  Maryann is kind and made us feel so very welcome.  All customers seemed to be smiling when she left their tables, Even the grumpiest looking people gave her a sincere smile ! Bravo to her as she is a wonderful  Server and manager . Tried many meals when in town and we have never been disappointed. This last visit with Maryann was the best . Treat her well Egg Works because she is your key to continued success ! Thank you young lady, You and the chef know how to please"}
{"text":"I'm truly surprised that the reviews for this place are as high as they are.  I've been here a dozen times and I've never had a meal that was better than mediocre.    Pros: The service has always been really friendly and attentive and our food has come out quickly and correctly without exception.  Cons: Everything tastes like it has been sitting under a hotlamp for several hours.  The food is--at best--bland and highly processed and the prevailing \"taste\" is salt.  In short, it's the kind of place you would either go with your kids on a Saturday morning or go to try to gorge away a hangover."}
{"text":"Easy 5 stars for our server Nicki. Very friendly, efficient and informative. She appears to enjoy having a little fun conversation with customers while providing great service.   My partner and I have tried several breakfast spots in this general southeast side of Vegas over the past few months. Most have been fairly average. With just one visit Egg Works became my favorite. It has a very Hawaiian feel which I love, that's the food and the Aloha.   The food and preparation are very high quality. I had the Stuffed French Toast sandwich and loved it. Just so much food though. Very filling. Next time I will order a 1/2 order which I understand is available with quite a few items on the menu. Perfect?  The Banana Bread Muffin is one of the best I've had. I don't say that lightly, my partner and I have sampled much Banana Bread (and Shave Ice) when visiting Hawaii. It definitely instantly reminded me of Julia's on Maui.   They have a huge menu and I'm really looking forward to sampling more on my next visit.  Aloha and Mahalo to Nicki and Egg Works"}
{"text":"I've yet been disappointed with Egg Work's performance.   Their menu has mostly everything you would want for breakfast. Food is always on point and best of all, served fast! Personal favorites would be their delicious muffins and how they leave a whole pot of coffee at your table.   The waiting game is not played here!"}
{"text":"I love this place- been coming here for years. The veggie skillet is delicious and healthy! I always get the same lovely waitress (unfortunately) I do not know her name- I wish I did! She gives us excellent customer service every time."}
{"text":"our favorite sunday breakfast   eatery... the staff is ALWAYS awesome ... the servers and hosts MORE THAN earn their tips... i don't like breakfast  anywhere else... 4 years been coming since we moved here ..."}
{"text":"4 stars because I never give 5. Great breakfast, it came swiftly. I had corned beef hash, she had eggs Benedict. Very good. Raul was our server and he was great. Customer service has led us to walk out before ordering at other places. Not here. Raul was top notch. Would come back again."}
{"text":"We were looking for a great place to eat that wasn't a part of the strip, and was relatively cheap but better than Denny's. This place is awesome! Great atmosphere. Tasty breakfast food which is higher quality than any other breakfast place we've been to. Relatively inexpensive prices.   Very impressed and we will definitely be back next time we come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Caitlin was professional, friendly and provided excellent service!   We had our kid's hockey team and and parents for breakfast.  Service and food were excellent.  Highly recommend!  Skillets and breakfast burritos were great.  Huevos Rancheros too."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go for breakfast or brunch on the weekend. The staff is always so friendly and the food is prepared just the way you order it."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place.   The food is great, the atmosphere is wonderful.  Enjoy the coffee.   Really a great place."}
{"text":"If I'm ever in Las Vegas, I HAVE to eat at Egg Works! This was the first time I was at this location, it is super nice. The food is always awesome, especially the banana muffin. We sat outside on the deck and enjoyed the sun. I'll definitely keep going to this location the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"**UPDATED**  Seeing that the manager Maggie is willing to go out of her way to ensure that we are accommodated correctly for our experience, is enough to try the restaurant again."}
{"text":"absolutely the best breakfast in Las Vegas hands down.  The drawback, its very loud and very crowded which keeps this place in business, so its good for business.  Parking is scarce so when its full just park at Lee's and walk down."}
{"text":"I have been here a half dozen times and the quality of the food and service is always consistent. I have never had a bad meal or service here."}
{"text":"First off, Raul was top notch as our waiter. He was able to handle our table of 21 with no trouble at all. I wish I could give him 10 stars! The banana muffins are to die for. We all were able to check in and get a free muffin. Our cups were always filled. We had the home fries and those are to die for. If you're from Long Beach and you've eaten tommy fries, it's that exact seasoning. We got the gumbolyaya with the cheese garlic bread. My husband was in love. It was such a big portion too. He couldn't finish it. Another dish was the blackened prime rib eggs Benedict. It was perfect with the croissant instead of an English muffin. The country fried steak was a little salty but good. The waffles were good! Just wish it was a little more crispier."}
{"text":"This is an interesting place. The inside is open and very utilitarian. There are not a lot of frills. The service is good and the prices are fair too. I enjoyed my meal, but I could not eat hear to often without gaining a crazy amount of weight. Everything is tasty, but not great for you.  I ordered the Mexican Crepe. I can assure you this is not what the French have in mind for crepes. That being said it was good and very filling. The crepe is filled with homemade chorizo, onions, green chilies and cheddar jack cheese. It is served with their Habla Diablo potatoes and toast. The flavors combined for a very good overall product. The potatoes were pretty good too.  This is a great place for breakfast food. Which as we all know is great for any meal."}
{"text":"Food was Spectacular, Service Amazing. Egg works really has delicious food. THANK YOU EGG WORKS"}
{"text":"Usually the service here is amazing but this time they messed up my order I ordered a Mexican dish that came with tortillas rice & beans let's just say I didn't get any of the 3 items I ordered & I asked the waitress about the rice and beans before I ordered. I received meat eggs & potatoes nothing else"}
{"text":"Two stars for food and three stars for service.  We had breakfast here last Saturday and none of us finished our food because it was not that great at all.  The table next to us sent one of their plates back after one bite.  I don't understand the long line at this place.  I ordered the Key Largo Crepe.  It was so heavy with cheddar cheese that I couldn't taste other ingredients came with it.  The supposedly fresh made banana nut muffin tasted worst than store bought mixed.  The server was friendly but that was the only thing stand out about this place.  We will continued our search for a better breakfast place elsewhere."}
{"text":"banana nut muffin  omg. something about that muffin makes me want to crave it.  came here because of the stellar reviews and a groupon deal. so why not?  our friend's office wasn't too far from here, so we decided to eat here and stop by our friend's office afterwards.  * there's a lot of parking * service is fast * friendly atmosphere * loco moco was on point * chicken fried steak was done right  will return again soon!"}
{"text":"Decent food for good price, banana nut muffins are amazing. They usually forget to put something in your to go orders. Good amount of food, most main dishes are between 8-13$"}
{"text":"Egg works on eastern is an amazing place to eat only for dine in , but there pick up service is one egg short from An omelet. They have a cooking staff that does not only get your order wrong they also have lack of hairnets so I would advise you to dine in because pick up is like picking up hot garbage not a top 5 experience whatsoever 2 out of 5 stars in my books"}
{"text":"I will more than likely give this place a 4 the next time I visit...because I like the atmosphere and the clean restaurant. Our server Nely was great however, the potatoes were too salty, the med steak was well done (like way done), the waffle was cold, and when it was brought back to the table the other server wasted the hot syrup n my girlfriends skillet, that she was right in the middle of enjoying. So our first experience wasn't the best. But we'll try again."}
{"text":"Banana muffin was awesome. Service awesome model train goes around the whole restaurant very cool first time here but I'll definitely come back and would recommend it highly"}
{"text":"It's ok. Maybe I came on a really busy Sunday. I had heard about this place from a friend and was excited but it did no please my taste buds. I will give it another shot. I had an omelette and I have had better at ihop. The prices are reasonable and that does matter."}
{"text":"Candice was an awesome waitress(: she tended to us outside with our beagle doggy. She brought him water and everything. Very genuine and sweet lady. The food was amazing as always. I didn't give it 5 stars because they had no strawberries for my waffel. And the sausage links I had did not taste good. Tasted burnt. :P other wise great experience as always we'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Veronica is an exceptional server. My wife and I enjoyed the Mexican omelet. They played all of the NFL games on their tv's so that was also nice. The menu is vast so you can get something new every time you go. Everyone including the host was very friendly and welcoming. Best brekky in Summerlin."}
{"text":"It seems like genuinely exceptional customer service is hard to come by anymore. The Noteworthy kind, at least.   When I came in with a client of mine who is watching his weight, the hostess (Peyton) was not only friendly and happy, but she went well out of her way to not only recommend health conscious items, but actually handwrite a list of suggestions and what they include. I was floored by the effort placed, especially as busy as her job was in the morning.   Peyton is invaluably good at her job and the management made sure to share our appreciation of her. They will have my continued business for a long time."}
{"text":"Wow!!! These people must not know what good food is because this place sucks..and the service was horrible,.this place is completely over rated..if you want to eat a great breakfast try EATS downtown..as for this i'd rather go to ihop"}
{"text":"Very good places if you'd like to eat like the locals. The cleanliness is something to compare to IHOP so don't expect that strip luxury but this is a great please with great food."}
{"text":"This was my first visit for breakfast using a BOGO coupon from a local newspaper.  They were located on W Flamingo Rd/S Ft Apache Rd in Las Vegas.  They had a cute Egg Flip card if you need something at your table.  We were brought warm banana nut muffins on a small plate.  It tasted more like bran than banana.  There was butter on the table.  My friend ordered the California Crepe.  It had diced bacon, sliced mushrooms, diced tomatoes, guacomole and Swiss cheese with a side of Hollandaise sauce.  The crepe was not thin like a French crepe.  It looked heavy like an omlette.  She asked for unseasoned potatoes.  I ordered the Works Skillet.  It had a layer of potatoes covered with ham, bacon, sliced sausage links, mushrooms, onions, peppers and tomatoes, melted cheese and over easy eggs.  We paid at the counter and presented the coupon."}
{"text":"Candice... Simply fabulous... Service was fast,  attentive and friendly...we will definitely back when we're in town and we'll be asking for Candice!!!  Boom"}
{"text":"Shout out to Vanessa! She was our server on Sunday and was one of the best servers we've ever had. The portions here are great and food quality is as well. If you haven't eaten here yet, do it!!"}
{"text":"On business I am often on a tight schedule so I stick to the food chains I know. Today with a lighter schedule I wanted to try something new.  the yelp reviews on the Egg Works were good, so off I went.  It was 10:45 Sunday morning, the place was packed with a waiting line, but being a solo I could immediately set at the counter. Looking at the long and impressive list of choices I selected a hard to find item, Corn Beef Hash topped with 2 Eggs Sunnyside,  coffee and Rye toast from the friendly and  courteous SHANTEl, who brought me a carafe or coffee real cream and water.  The impressively quick service bought forth a large plate of Corn Beef Hash  that was delicious.  The unexpected addition was the chorus line of staff working in concert at a frantic pace to make up and deliver the orders.   I will be back on every trip.  I strongly suggest you give it a Go!"}
{"text":"Great food .... Carnitas huevos rancheros special was yummy... Candice was great. Thanks for your attentive service."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Got the omelette with chilli relleno in it and of course the amazing muffins.  Diana was great to my family and I :)"}
{"text":"AWESOME local breakfast place. get the eggs, really and make sure you get the muffin instead of toast AMAZING. Big portions and great service, will be back."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday morning craving breakfast but I couldn't decide between their breakfast burrito or their Key Largo Crepe. I finally decided on the crepe because I thought that might be healthier...but now that I think about it I don't think either can be described as healthy. The Key Largo had Smoked Turkey, diced bacon, guacamole, diced tomatoes, and cheddar and jack cheese. Topped with sour cream and a side of salsa. It was also served with some potatoes on the side. This is the first non dessert crepe I have eaten so it had a lot to live up to. It was yummy but I think I will just stick to crepes as a dessert . I think it's because I've programmed myself to think of them as sweet and when I don't get that I think it comes up as second rate in my mind. I do know what I want to try there when I go back ...this lady next to me had this yogurt looking parfait . It had what looked like blueberries and mandarin oranges on the top.That may  be a contender on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Service was excellent considering on how massively busy they were. Thanks Gabriel for a excellent experience."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast in Vegas! The banana nut muffins are a must! I also had the chili relleno omelet which is awesome. Very happy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast with a Southwest flare! Their banana nut muffins are bomb! A definite must see!"}
{"text":"Usually come here on weekends and as you can imagine it's packed. However, never waited longer than 5 min to get seated.  Once seated, the server is very attentive.  Food is quick and good. Always a great experience."}
{"text":"Living in North Vegas, it's a drive out of our way to eat here for breakfast, but we've done it more than once, as we prefer it to Egg & I on Sahara.  There's a bit more room to breathe in this location -- people aren't bumping their asses into you while you're trying to eat your bacon and the staff is ultra friendly and FAST!  We went this past Saturday, ordering an omelette and a classic breakfast. Before we even finished checking in online, our meals were in front of us -- almost TOO fast, actually. I hardly had time to enjoy my coffee. But we couldn't blame them for being efficient.   We usually end up taking half of our breakfast home and making breakfast tacos for dinner with the leftovers, so it's a great deal at roughly $24 (considering we get two meals out of it).   I do take issue with the frozen cubed season-salt \"homestyle\" potatoes they server (just like Egg & I). I wish they would make fresh hashbrowns.   The parking can be a little tricky, but there's plenty of places to park if you're willing to walk more than 10 feet.  This is part of the regular rotation of breakfast joints now, for sure."}
{"text":"Great food great service no complaints my always go to breakfast place.the chilly burger is great"}
{"text":"I had the blackened prime rib Benny was bomb!!!! Instead of the hollandaise sauce I subsititue for white country gravy. The pertains were huge. And the prices were a good amount for the size of the portioned meal.  Well worth it."}
{"text":"If I want to go to a breakfast restaurant to get satisfied AND full,  this is the place. Their skillets are really great. I ordered the \"Works\" skillet that included eggs, fried potatoes,  onions,  mushrooms,  green peppers, ham and sausage. Very tasty.  Add some black pepper for some subtle spiciness and you're golden.   As for the service; it's wonderful. Donna was our server for the day and she was very courteous to our needs. Really great service from her.  The only reason I did not give a 5 star rating was because of the pancakes that I ordered. I always order pancakes for every meal. My dissatisfaction was that their batter does not seem fresh. The only way I knew that it wasn't,  was because the pancakes were very tough to cut. My only assumption is that the batter is already pre made throughout the entire day and thus the gluten is already activated and hardened. I believe the goal to a good pancake is to NOT premake the batter and just make a fresh new batter for every pancakes order requested."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot! Never lets you down. Great breakfast, big portions, great prices. Definitely has the feel of \"diner food's and I love it!!! And...they always have deals on Groupon that saves you $6 off $20. Of you gonna spend it anyway...you cant go wrong"}
{"text":"very good breakfast menu and they serve large portions.  its a popular place so it gets crowded in there even tho the space is large already.  if you like eggs, pancakes or breakfast in general, try egg works out, their tasty."}
{"text":"This place is flat out the best breakfast spot I have ever found in Vegas.  Not too fancy, just really insanely good in an old school way."}
{"text":"The food and service here is great. Everything is fresh and delicious, but for breakfast food it is super expensive. Why should an omelette cost $14. Is this the Aria?"}
{"text":"Before I moved to vegas, my fiancé and I checked this place out and loved it. Its a nice breakfast place and reallllllllly good coffee. Pretty affordable too."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying that the food was great. Our server a guy from Hawaii was so nice. I can't say that about the server next to me. Jenny. She was awful. I can not believe the way she talked to a guest. it was an elderly man, dining alone. Who I found out has been in the restaurant industry for 30 years. We were seated by the kitchen and I can hear her yelling at people. I know it was here because it stopped when she left and started when she went back. The worse part is that she may have been a manager since she had a different shirt on then everyone else. Which sucks because she probably won't even be held accountable.  I will be back but won't be seated in her station. I have been waiting tables for years and would never talk that way."}
{"text":"Tanya did an amazing job, great food, great price, definitely beats anything on the strip"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast, and fell in love. Everything from the atmosphere to the food to the servers was excellent!! I had the breakfast wrap with the diablo potatoes, and I think it has just become my favorite breakfast food ever. Definitely worth a try for anyone looking for a great meal that isn't crazy expensive."}
{"text":"Eggworks staff are awesome!! Curtis (server) and Anna (greeter) provide excellent service!!"}
{"text":"Just not very good.  My chili omelette wasn't very good.   The potatoes weren't very good.  The sausages seemed like they were under-cooked.  The biscuits and gravy were mediocre and the eggs my mom ate were too greasy, which made her sick.  I love breakfast and have been to quite a few places.  Unfortunately, Egg Works doesn't really come close to being a quality establishment.  I can easily think of 5 breakfast restaurants that serve better food.  Unfortunately, none of those restaurants are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Had the traditional Eggs Benedict was really good, but the Canadian Bacon had too much smoke flavor which overpowered the Hollandaise Sauce and eggs a milder version would be much better.  My server Maria was very friendly, helpful and extremely prompt with my order from start to finish"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Service has really fell off and I haven't been able to get a correct order for a while now. This last visit my skillet was completely opposite from what I asked for. They put extra cheese instead of light cheese that I asked for. And I wanted the shredded hash browns and I got the deep fried patties instead. We'll be eating at a different location from now on."}
{"text":"Great biscuits and gravy! My husband loved the bacon avocado omelette and best of all was the service. Super nice staff and quick service. When you check in through yelp you also get the best banana nut muffin ever! Honestly good food"}
{"text":"Great breakfast that's affordable. The wait time for seating and service was prompt. The corn beef hash was delicious. The waitress was super nice and attentive. They had the best banana muffin that you could ever have to eat. I will definitely return the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best service! Best food! Marianne and Austin treated us so wonderfully. We were delightfully surprised that they offer mimosas and bloody Mary's! I recommend!"}
{"text":"I love  this place always clean the people are nice.  I have the chilli rel omelet. My favorite"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great value for money, and so much to choose from  we really like the fact they are super busy on Sunday mornings  makes you feel good :)"}
{"text":"First time here and the service and food was awesome, I will recommend this place to fam and friends. I'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is always A-MAZING. I used to go to the one on Flamingo but it is super crowded especially on Sundays. So, I was thrilled when this place opened closer to where I live.   You get seated fairly quickly - the longest I've had to wait was 10 minutes.   I've never, ever had a bad meal here. My favorite is the veggie Benny. I love poached eggs. The omelets are always great, and I am also a fan of their huevos rancheros. I usually get a side of hash brown patties in place of the Works potatoes, only because I'm tired of them. My boyfriend likes their pancakes with blueberries. He often orders the skillet breakfasts too. I usually get one of their delicious Bloody Marys, yum. It is served in a mason jar with celery and garlic-stuffed olives.   I was pleasantly surprised to see they are the only Egg Works who are open for dinner. Their pizza is quite tasty. Yes, the bright fluorescent lighting is a little harsh any time of day - BUT - if you sit in the room to the right when you first walk in (has a fake fireplace) the lighting is dimmer and more homey. They even have a good selection of wine, which I was impressed.   The service is always friendly and fast. They have outdoor seating as well, and plenty of big flat screen TVs that are usually on the news or ESPN (yay!)"}
{"text":"I decided to try something different besides the simple eggs and bacon breakfast.  I went for a eggs benny instead and that was a mistake. It was the worst that I have ever had. The sauce was covered on everything and it was in a bowl which made the bread soaked in it. Plus the sauce was a dark yellow and as it got cold you could see the sauce clumping together. It was horrible! The fries were covered in seasoning that you couldn't even taste the potatoes. We also sat here for awhile before getting food and any refills. My son's got the corn beef hash and the plate was mainly potatoes. This place is great for your very basic breakfast. But, after this visit I am not going to be coming back."}
{"text":"I love Egg & I, so whenever I'm in town I have to go there.   However, this place was closer to where my friend lives.  It's essentially the same menu, same vibe.  If you've been to Egg & I  then this place will be very familiar.  We went New Years Eve for brunch.  I think we got there at the right time because the line to pay was LONG and the line to be seated was practically non existent.  We were seated right away.  Our server came quickly and was quite friendly.  We ordered our food and in less than 10 mins our food came out, just like at Egg & I.    We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Breakfast lovers this is worth the trip!  We contemplated Gabi at Bellagio yet opted for low key, off the strip breakfast before we dive in to crowds and casinos.  This place is exceptional!  I had Brads Omelette.  I did substitute bacon for mushrooms.  So I was boring right, no Benny, no stuffed toast, yet I felt it was one of the best omelettes I have EVER had.  Brad must be a big deal and the menu is huge so Brad, consider a \"Brad's with bacon\" it was out of this world.  We shared a warm, fresh, banana nut muffin that was on the house from the relationship with Yelp.  It was incredible too!   Most important though.  The service.  The young people who greet you are exceptional.  Our server Chris awesome.  From the minute you walk in and they greet you at the foot snd seat you, to being seated, to being served it feels like family.  And is a great marketing engine for the good people of Las Vegas!  Great job guys!   This is not a fancy place. It is practical.  If I didn't know you t was a chain I would have sworn it was a stand alone family restaurant which it must be yet they have preserved that personal touch as they have expanded.  I am from out of tow, great personal Vegas experience.  Wonderful way to start your day off strip or before catching a flight out early off strip.  Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Our server Brady was super nice and attentive. He made breakfast fun!  The banana nut muffin was delicious."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast before our training meeting today an not only was the service great the food is always amazing.  It is hard to get disappointed with the food selection and taste at this place.    Depending on the time which we try to make it early, there is never a wait, the coffee is good and the as I said above the food is amazing.  I will have to look at the receipt again for the server we had, she is tall with blonde hair and she is one of the friendliest people I have ever met there.  She is always cheerful and really cares about her customers.    Those who go in there often enough she will get to know you and will treat you like a family friend.  I highly recommend this place even though they no longer show appreciation to veterans."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  I have been here a few times and have tried different items and everytime, it has been great.    The portions are a great size and guess what???  They give a military discount here.  So far I have not had any complaints about the food, or the service.  I have also never heard any complaints from anyone I have been here with.  So if you are hungry for good food from breakfast to 3:30pm, this is the place to go.  I would definitely recommend you try this place if you are in the area, you will not be disappointed.  Lastly, our server was Jaclyn and she was AWESOME...if you go and can get her table, you will have some GREAT service and she will keep you happy."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's one of our go-to breakfast spots. The weekends get pretty crowded, but it's worth the wait.   Their banana muffins are super good, my son LOVES them. Also love the fact that they serve rice. Being from Hawaii, I love having rice with my bacon. They're really generous with their portions as well.   Their service is always great, I'd recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"Really love the food here and the service is always top notch. One of my go-to places for breakfast food. Highly recommend the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Delicious food with a side of super friendly staff is served at this all-American breakfast restaurant. The portions are generous and you get your money's worth. The fresh veggie omelette was good and was glad they offered egg white options as well. Along with this came seasoned potatoes and choice of bread (white, wheat, rye, etc...). The potatoes were magical; within a few bites I forgot I was supposed to limit my carb intake in the first place. The French toast is legit and I would be happy to order another plate.   However, I can't say the same for the pancakes which caused some Aunt Jemima-preservative-box variety déjà vu: disappointingly dry, flavorless, and let me feeling like a bloated cow. Unfortunately, frugality overcame me and I tried to eat as much as I could and would later regret this decision. Décor is your standard diner than can be seen in New York to Pahrump. Oddly, giant stuffed animals have taken over part of the waiting area. I'm not sure if these dirty, dust filled monstrosities have a purpose other than to entertain inpatient children, but they need to go. Service throughout was great. Drinks were poured when needed, food didn't take forever, and the waitress gave us our bill without asking. Definitely not the fanciest place to get brunch, but it deserves some love."}
{"text":"This place has great \"home-cooked\" food. The food is prepared with TLC. It's fresh, warm & tasty. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"First time hear, visiting from Atlanta. I ordered the works skillet and substituted all the pork for turkey. This skillet was AMAZING very flavorful, I put the habla diablo verde sauce on top which was a great touch. Last but not least the banana nut muffin was great, topped with some butter it was a great combination."}
{"text":"Avoid this place.   Went there on Saturday around 11:30 and was seated in the booth area because the main dining area was lit way too brightly by white fluorescent office light.  Ordered our drinks from the busser and then had three different waitresses try to take our order in the next several minutes. They seemed a bit confused, but were all very nice.     Ordered a corona from the busser.  We had no menus yet, so I asked how much it would be. He said $3.50. Menu said $4.50.   Ordered the cabo breakfast burrito and the eggs benedict pizza.  Both were barely edible.   The chorizo in the burrito was so overcooked that is was like ground beef left out overnight and tasted nothing like chorizo, salsa was out of a jar or can, there was maybe a tablespoon of sour cream on top, eggs were wet and rubbery, tortilla was old and the red sauce on top was like the stuff you get with the dollar frozen enchilada meals at the grocery store.  $10  Pizza dough was not cooked through before the hollandaise sauce was put on so it was wet and rubbery. The sauce was lacking flavor and too salty. The eggs were cooked perfectly. Should have ordered three eggs. $13  Breakfast potatoes were cubed and rolled in seasoned salt. More dry than crispy.  NO HASH BROWNS!  They did however have those potato pucks that McDonalds serves.   Tab was just at $30 plus tip  when we were done. Waste of money."}
{"text":"This place has huge portions and very friendly service!  My mom and I came here the morning we moved into our new home in Vegas. We wanted something filling and delicious that would last us most of the day and this ended up being the perfect place! We shared an omelet. It came with the possibility of potatoes or fruit. When I looked really torn between the two, our waiter offered to do half and half so we could have a little of each!   Also, they gave both my mom and me the check-in offer. We took of banana bread with us to for the guys back home who'd be doing all the real heavy lifting.   I look forward to returning sometime soon and trying one of their sweeter options!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our first visit. Our dog Jellybean was even more grateful to be welcomed!"}
{"text":"No complaints about this place at all!   I usually get the Sunrise Mountain and end up taking half home! So damn good! I love their potatoes as well and their hot sauce.   I've been here a couple times and I remember the first time I came, my plate came with fresh fruit on the side. The last couple times I've come here, there's no fresh fruit! What the fudge? Whatever the plate full of food in front of me made me quickly forget.  Boy gets the corned beef hash and in particular likes the poached eggs that he can order with it.   My safe go-to whenever I'm craving a hearty breakfast. :)"}
{"text":"Hey classic diner like place. Lot's of moving pieces...but I understand why! This place is awesome. Try the French Toast Sandwich."}
{"text":"My little, big family of 6 come here every so often and I must say the food is delicious. The waitresses we've had are patient with our 2 year old and are very nice."}
{"text":"I've been to Egg Works before, but this was the first time ever coming for lunch. I actually was kind of surprised that they even had lunch items being that I only think of this place on the weekend and solely for breakfast, but their lunch was actually not too shabby.  I came with some coworkers for quick meal during a break between a seminar. I started with a glass of their fresh squeezed OJ first (gotta get that vitamin C in). It was definitely fresh & tasty, I'd recommend it! For my main meal I had the Works Tostada Salad without the meat to make it vegetarian friendly. This salad was HUGE! I think I managed to eat about 3/4 before I gave up. The flavor was very good, I liked the red & green sauce to top it off. The only negative about this mammoth was that the shell gets soggy on the bottom from all the toppings and breaks through. Meh.   Overall it was a tasty visit and I'd come here again for more lunch or breakfast goodies."}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to get back into this place and give it another try for the love of eggs benedict. I went on a Sunday around 1 pm and it was a 20 min wait for the two of us, not too bad I guess considering its most likely their peak time.   The service was much better this time. The waitress was very attentive and made multiple checks on us throughout our meal. She also explained the payment process of bringing the bill up to the front when we were ready.   The food was also much better. The eggs were cooked perfectly and home style fries as well. I do wish however the eggs had a little less bolognese just for my own liking but still good.   Overall I was much happier with my visit this time and would come back again for more, maybe just not during peak hours."}
{"text":"Waited a bit on saturday morning. I ordered stuffed french toast and my girl ordered biscuits and gravy. Biscuits and gravy were ok but cold and not enough gravy. Stuffed french toast had weird tasting eggs with tiny specs of bacon in it. Both of us are sick to our stomachs an hour later. There are much better places to eat in this area. One of which is right down the road."}
{"text":"Our server Nataline was so awesome! She totally made the experience amazing. I think my top five favorite things in the world were accomplished here this morning: earl grey tea with cream and sugar, a smothered breakfast burrito, mimosas, my man, and great service.   Nataline was so nice and welcoming and even when our pancakes came out late she went above and beyond to make sure we left happy. That is just such a rarity anymore and I feel like it should absolutely be noticed and rewarded. If her manager is reading this, I hope you will let her know that she made our day and made die hard regular guests out of us for life.   I wish every time I went out to eat Nataline could be our server. She is just so awesome. Thank you thank you thank you!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst dining experiences I've had to date. Between the condescending waitress talking down to other staff behind the bar while yelling over people eating, to showing my waitress my hard poached eggs and asking for properly poached eggs only to have her return with a dish for me to shovel them into mid meal so she can prove to the cook they messed up,  to her returning to my table with the soggy running poached eggs I couldn't even finish my meal. Worst corn beef hash ever, pretty sure it was canned, also being told I could ice my own coffee at my table, gross."}
{"text":"Eggs!!!  Egg Works is a chain of breakfast joints located throughout Vegas, off strip.   This location is located by the airport. Open for breakfast and lunch only.   Typical old school breakfast joint decor. Very crowded all the time. Service was friendly and fast. Portions are huge and filling.   Yelp Check in gets you a free Banana Nut Muffin.  Spinach Benny - $10.99 - Eggs were poached well. Yolk was runny and gooey. Typical benny with spinach for freshness. I got the hollandaise on the side. Our server gave me both to try, traditional and chipotle. I liked the chipotle since it had a nice kick to it. Comes with home style potatoes, cooked and seasoned well.   Breakfast Tostada - $11.50 - I got the chicken version with tomatillo salsa. The tostada is loaded with eggs, cheese, potatoes, and beans. Good for the first few bites but then the taste gets boring. Huge portion.   Banana Nut Muffin - $1.95 - Deep deep molasses flavor. Moist and tender muffin. Did not taste much banana flavor. And it did not have many pieces of nuts."}
{"text":"Our server, Jamie, did an excellent job. Friendly and knowledgeable.  Food was good as usual."}
{"text":"Great food. Huge portions. Love the diablo potatos. Bought the seasoning and just made my own for breakfast. The wait can be long but well worth it. Used to head out to egg and i on sahara but this is our new favorite spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and decided to come here for breakfast and boy am I glad I did, Nicole was an amazing server and made us feel like family here, and the food was phenomenal,  highly recommend this place, thanks Nicole!"}
{"text":"My hubs and I frequent this location rather often.  Breakfast is our favorite meal and we often cook it ourselves at home, but when we are feeling a bit lazy, we hit up some breakfast spots.  We have only gone to one other egg works and this one is definitely busy.  So if you have a big party, expect to wait awhile.  Luckily, turnaround is rather quick.    I usually like to get some type of Benedict, but on this trip I got the Works crepe.  I ordered the full order, as opposed to half order which is 2 eggs, because I needed my protein that morning.  It wasn't what I expected, however, since it was different, I could see myself ordering it again.  A comparison, its served omelette style, you just get your \"eggs\" served differently.    One thing that never fails is the banana nut bread, its yummy and compliments your overflowing protein.  One thing I have noticed is that a lot of their menu items are pretty much the same thing served either separate, on a hot plate, or everything is cooked together.    Their country fried steak is cut, not served as a whole piece, and so is their prime rib too.  That unfortunately is disappointing.  I will have to try something different and out of the ordinary next time.  I'm still on the hunt to find my go to plate here at Egg Works."}
{"text":"\"Dem potatoes doe.\" Imagine cajun spices grinded into a dust then is sprinkled on crispy bitesized potato cubes.  The french toast is fluffy crispy sweet & eggy.  Don't leave without the banana nut muffin. Its moist sweet and super mouth watering!!!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast, loved the banana nut muffin. Out waitress LuAnna was the best! Go see her if you get the chance!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast food and excellent service by PK!!! Will definitely go back for another friendly and delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went on a business trip recently, and turns out our hotel for us did not have complementary breakfast. Which is fortunate for us because we came here every morning for breakfast while in Vegas. Yes it's that good.  Service wise we were always seated right away. Waiter was always attentive to us. The first time  we got there, our server noticed I was checking in on yelp and she got me the banana nut muffin with out me asking.  Food: They give a lot of food. Whatever I ordered I could never finish. I love that they have lighter options that you can sub out instead of potatoes.  Most of their breakfast meal come with toast or the banana nut muffin. GET THE MUFFFIN. Seriously, it's good. They bring it out nice a warm and you can put like a slice of butter and it will melt at make it ok so yummy. In all honesty though it doesn't even need the extra butter because it nice a smooth.  The first day I got one of their skillet dishes. It had spinach and chicken with eggs (preparers the way you like it), all over the diablo potatoes. I liked how the potatoes were seasoned. It had a nice kick of spice to it. But if your looking for more spice you can add more of their diablo sauce. I couldn't finish it because I was too full halfway through the meal.   Second day, I was really craving smoothing lighter do I got the breakfast parfait and a small stack of banana pancakes. Again it came with the muffin. This time the muffin was a bit of and edge like it was left in the oven just a tad bit longer, I'm one of those people who fight the the edge piece in brownies-it gave it the little extra bit of texture that I love. I guess I didn't learn from the first time, they came with huge portions. The parfait had mandarin oranges, strawberries, blueberries, and bananas layer in between the granola and yogurt. Banana pancakes was loaded with bananas. It was sweet enough so no need for syrup.  By the third day I was craving some local Hawai'i food. And lo and behold they have some Hawai'i favorites. I saw the loco moco but I really wanted some country gravy. No problem they have a play on the loco moco called the Haole Moco. It was yummy. By far my favorite breakfast item. The country gravy really went well with the hamburger. The mushrooms  also added to the flavor. Makes me wish we have the haole moco back Home.  One take away, come hungry because you will leave stuffed."}
{"text":"Tanya is a great server. It was our first time there! Food quality is good and prices are acceptable!"}
{"text":"Okay so we got here at 10am party of 6 and told the girl we had a dog and wanted to sit outside. She said the wait would be 20 minutes. 45 minutes later is when we actually got a table out on the pigeon infested patio. After we ordered, two meals came out first and the other four came put 15 minutes later. The server told us that the kitchen only allows a max of 5 orders for one table at a time.... so I'm guessing this is why we waited 45 minutes and not 20.  I gave it two stars because while this experience at this location was completely unsatisfactory and just uncomfortable with the nasty pigeons landing on my table, my food, although I couldn't sit out there long enough to finish it, was good."}
{"text":"Yum! Lots of food and good value. The omelet is big, and you get hella fries. I didn't like the muffin too much and liked the toast more. This place reminds of Scramblz in the Bay Area. The service is great and I would come back again. I wish it was closer to the strip, but probably would be filled with crazy folks. This is definitely a nice friendly place to have brunch."}
{"text":"A winner every time! The food is super yummy and the service is great. Everything we've had from eggs to sandwiches has been very good!! We'll be regulars at this spot."}
{"text":"#15 of 2017  Down home, all-American comfort food.  And a toy train on the tracks above the dining room?  C'mon now, how cute is that!  Egg Works is a great breakfast spot, serving about 1000 different breakfast items.  The problem will be choosing your entree.  Everything we tried was scrumptious.  My fiance got the chicken fried steak skillet and I was tempted to ask for a trade....his looked and tasted SO good!  I got the Huevos Rancheros with green sauce which was very flavorful.  I thought it was a little over-sauced as I couldn't really taste the tortilla and beans underneath.  On the plus side, it came with a side of home fries to help sop up my sauce and runny egg.  Prices were very reasonable, dishes were no more than $10-11.  Check in for a free banana muffin!  Check in for a free banana muffin Check in for a free banana muffin Check in for a free banana muffin Check in for a free banana muffin  Get the point?  Trust me.  The muffin is amazing!"}
{"text":"Amanda was my server and was very polite, fast, and on top of things! The seasoned potatoes with anything is where it's at."}
{"text":"I had my farewell breakfast with my guests here this morning and it is now after 5 and I am still full - still can't eat the delicious lunch I brought to work - and this is not really a bad thing!  I have eaten here twice - the location is good, service is very good.  The hostesses were so friendly!  The first time I went, I had the fiesta skillet..sooo much food.  Today I had the Works Veggie Benny...I am so grateful to our waitress who told me I could get a half or a full order.  I got the half...and I am still full like 7 hours later!  It was a beautiful English muffin with grilled tomato, fresh spinach and avocado plus a poached egg and hollandaise.  It came with a huge side of super hot, wonderfully seasoned breakfast potatoes...no grease or mush or anything - crispy and yummy!  My guests had pancakes and scrambled eggs - a plain short stack was enough for 3 people and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  Drinks were refilled and the waitress left the entire pitcher of coffee on the table for our one coffee drinker!  This is a fun place to go with a group - and they weren't busy on a random Wednesday around 9 AM.  I am soooo full from my half order but I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I'm happy to report that Egg Works does seem to care to make sure that your Eggs (and more) really Works. Hey, ya gotta crack a few eggs to make an omelette, right?   Service, per usual, is great. Typically, the biggest challenge at EW, in my opinion, is deciding what to order. With so much to choose from, I felt compelled to try something 'new' to me.   I don't think I'd ever had a skillet of any kind here, so I tried and enjoyed the Fresh Veggie Skillet. Atop a layer of their Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes, is onion, tomato, bell pepper, sliced mushrooms, and fresh spinach, two over-easy eggs and finished with melted cheese. It's a good, hearty yet still relatively lighter option. And having been making the rounds at some steakhouses the previous few nights, a tasty oasis for me.   Choose between the fabulous banana nut muffin or toast, I went with my usual, the swirly rye. I don't always remember that butter is standard, so ask for dry if that's your mood. And on the health note: one of my dining companions ordered tomatoes (instead of potatoes). I got to try some too. Fresh and good. I am very pleased that when someone orders tomatoes as their side, that at EW, you actually get a full portion of tomatoes. That's not always been my experience (at Cracked Egg, for instance).   OK, so, nobody's perfect. And to that, there was one little hiccup this time - lipstick on my coffee cup. Yikes! Just wished I'd noticed that BEFORE I start drinking from it. Not enough to knock off a star, but maybe a reminder that things do get busy at EW, and it's a team effort to keep things running smooth. OK, next time, I'll try the pancakes, unless I have a hankering for an omelette.."}
{"text":"Another beautiful Egg Works location!  I love this place just as much as I love the other ones!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place after reading reviews and finding a good deal on Groupon, score!  Unfortunately the food wasn't anything impressive.  Actually,  it was barely memorable. I had a chicken cordon blue skillet and I don't remember what he had but it was also a skillet. We each tried the banana muffin too which is free with check in.  The waitress was ok she wasn't anything great.  Seemed like she had some regulars there that got most of her attention. At one point she started talking to them across the room from our table then just left.  We were chit chatting it wasn't important but I thought it was kinda rude. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the greek omletes enjoy the generous portions a normal breakfast place off the strip."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, brunch or lunch.  Food quality and the service (kudos to Nicole) were great!"}
{"text":"Meh, I've experienced better from breakfast and brunch restaurants. This was very average but for my first visit the price was great because we had a \"buy one entree get the second free (up to $8.00)\" coupon. Which was great, but for a buy one get one for only up to $8.00 it seemed silly because essentially all their meals are in the price range of $10-$12.  The place itself is huge and they have a cute country like theme with a train running on tracks above your head throughout the whole restaurant. Although right where we were seated, as we looked up to see the train pass by, you couldn't help but notice some cobweb on the ceiling.  On yelp they have the special to where you check in you get a free banana nut muffin, so we were excited to get that. It was a SUPER moist muffin, really tasty with some butter! For brunch I ordered the Santa Cruz burrito (chorizo sounded AMAZING for today). It was a mix of onions, peppers, eggs, chicken and chorizo covered in sauce, then served with a side of their Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. The potatoes were really tasty and crispy. The burrito itself was just so-so. I was REALLY looking forward for some chorizo but I couldn't taste any! And upon further inspection you could BARELY see ANY inside, it was all chicken and egg. Big let down.  My friend ordered their Grandma's Biscuits and Gravy, and although I didn't get to try it, I heard no complaints. Our waitress was sweet and accommodating, if I go back I think i'll try one of their sandwiches or pancakes, no more burritos from here for me."}
{"text":"Great food! French fries are to die for! Service was amazing and the patio is dog friendly.. They even brought the dogs treats and a water dish. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'll get right to the food.  We got a free banana nut muffin when we showed the server we checked in on Yelp. The muffin was moist and warm. It was good, but not as good as the banana bread at the Omelette House.  Then we ordered the Veggie Benny. It is their version of eggs Benedict without any meat. It had avocado, tomato slices, and spinach, served on top of an English muffin with hollandaise sauce. It was good, but I would have rather had the spinach cooked, not raw. The potatoes served on the side could have been crispier.  It was a good breakfast. They have an extensive menu. I will be back to try more of their menu items. The restaurant was also very clean and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"We have eaten here for years and we were really disappointed in the \"Works\" Omelete. It was really thin and did not include all the works as advertised. The banana muffin, coffee and service were all good.  We won't be back real soon."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast today while staying in the LV area for a few days. The food here is better than average, and the service is great. My server, Alohalina, was the best! So polite and nice. She's the best!  If I owned a competing restaurant, I'd hire servers like Alohalina.  Nice breakfast!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful breakfast at Egg Works and our server Ashley was the reason why I'm writing a review.  She was so pleasant and happily took our order again and again as we added things.  The food was great and a welcome change to the overwhelming choices on The Strip."}
{"text":"I love EGG WORKS! There was a never a time I've came and didnt enjoy my food or the service. Our server was name Ethan. He was so great at making sure everything was ok with us. He was also very apologetic when our food wasn't coming out yet, even tho we didn't mind the wait!  I ordered the egg work omelet. I'm not the usual person that likes to try new things when I go to similar places, I always order the same thing over & over. But it was actually worth the change. It was delicious! My boyfriend ordered the corn beef hash & oh my gosh kinda of reminded me of back home  he finished it in like 5 min! Lol.  & you can't forget the banna nut muffin, seriously the best I've ever had!  Seriously if you haven't been here before your totally missing out ."}
{"text":"I discovered this place by chance and came back as my niece who is a picky eater LOVES the potatoes.  They are busy but there isn't too long of a wait.  They also have patio seating.   Today I had the Pancho's scramble. It was yummy but don't get it with the beans they are something to miss so choose another option.  Amy S. was our server.  She was very sweet to the kids and checked on us without hovering.   All in all I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"We brought the family for breakfast the day after Fourth of July. Food was amazing and so was our server Veronica. She took care of us with our two small children. She kept checking on us and making sure we are good."}

{"text":"This is must go place in Las Vegas.  4 eatery around here. Most customer are local folks, servers BF, and Lunch. Close early afternoon. No dinner. French fries with special dressing. To o to can even buy it for home coming. I usually get a half order for myself. Work crepe is great, with poppy seeds dressing."}
{"text":"Hello everyone! So what to say about this place other than its Great! Brought my parents and my girlfriend here and I gotta say the food was excellent! The place itself it about average in size so it can fill up easily. But the service was great, all of the staff were very attentive and kind. They have these 2 egg symbols next to your table one with a happy face and the other with a sad face and you flip it to the sad face if you need something and since the staff work as a team the response time is very short which is good.  I ordered the country fried steak and I gotta say it's one of the best I have had. The gravy was very flavorful and the steak was cook very well, nice and crunch with a flavorful crust. It also comes with banana nut bread which is their specialty and taste great! The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the potatoes which were seasoned a little bit too much so it was a bit salty. But not a deal breaker.  My girlfriend got the chorizo skillet which was a mix of chorizo, potatoes, eggs and jalapeños and cheese and salsa. It was awesome every bite was flavorful but it was a large bite if you try to get everything on the fork!   My parents got the waffles which were soooo fluffy and cooked perfectly. Add some butter and syrup and you got a simply but delicious waffle.  Our servers name was Suzzy and she does such a great job about asking us how we are so if she's helping your table out you won't regret it.   Have fun everyone!"}
{"text":"Egg Works for breakfast, brunch and lunch. Everything you want on a weekend morning. The Chili Rellenos Omelette is delectable. I asked Tehani's recommendation and she read my mind. Thank you for a great experience"}
{"text":"Just really good food and service.  No surprise I got the loco moco here. But this time it was topped with country gravy. SO GOOD. They also had chili loco moco, but will have to try that another time. The gravy was thick and satisfying. My egg was a little overcooked (I asked for over medium, it got kind of well done). But the flavor and silky texture of the gravy over the rice.. heaven. It's like biscuits and gravy - but better!  The other dish we got was the chicken fried steak skillet. Unfortunately, it was a salt bomb. The chicken fried steak itself was tasty and fried nicely while still being juicy. However, those diablo potatoes were way too salty. Could have just been an accidental over-salting - but it was almost inedible.   I'm giving 4 stars though because my loco moco was on point, -1 for the extremely salty potatoes. Their banana nut muffin, however deserves 5 stars. It was warm, crispy edges, right amount of banana without being overwhelmed in the nut department. So weighing all of that together - solid 4/5. Would come again to try their works/cincy chili."}
{"text":"Never been here before. Live close so I decided to give it a try. Didn't know what to get so I told my server Brigette to order for me. Wow I was amazed on the choice country fried steak with rice and two eggs. It's like she knew my doctor said if I get one fried item then the other must be good. Believe it or not the two went so well together. Tasted amazing. Brigette took a risk by giving me rice for breakfast and it paid off big time. I will be back and yes I will only want to be served by her. A+++++++"}
{"text":"First time here and DONNA brought us some warm delicious banana nut muffins as a welcome. Best I have ever had. Then had a great omlete made the way we needed it because we are on a diet. Looking at other tables it all looked delicious! DONNA thanks for being such a great server! Will come back when we come back to vegas!"}
{"text":"Great service!  Our server was Eden.   Although we kept our Egg sign on its \"I'm Good\" Face, Eden still checked up on us without over doing it.  Coffee is all you can drink for 2.75 which me and my girls all shared (stated on the online menu)  and they give you a ton of Caramel Machiatto Delight creamers which I ended up taking the last for that was left. Come to think of it I don't think we were charged for that.   I like that while we were waiting for our entree Eden brought us out the homemade banana nut muffin.  (So we were told, if its your first time its free or its a side of your choice) or for you yelpers Check in for a FREE Muffin. ;)  I ordered the Sundance Special... OMG! It was soooooooo good! $13+ A veggie omelette w/ spinach, mushrooms, artichoke, Swiss cheese and topped with feta cheese and fresh tomatoes.  I even added avocado to it..... writing this is making my mouth water!  This dish would have been great for two, but I was able to finish it myself since it was a social event with my girls I kept stuffing this belly. Instead of potatoes, I asked for rice and l left 1 scoop of rice behind.  The girls had groupons which they had to pay separately. From an even $50 Bill, we paid a total of $13+!!!!!!!!!!!  Hell yes to US!  Oh and we got there at 8:30am - 10am it wasn't too busy at all even on Nevada Day."}
{"text":"Ah, breakfast--the most important meal of the day.  Egg Works is fantastic. This place is hustlin' and bustlin' full of energetic servers, large portions, and loyal customers! The food was hearty and delicious. Nothing at all went wrong!   The only reason I took off a star is because, personally, I wish the atmosphere felt a little less rushed (lots of people = lots of noise). I think I would have enjoyed my dining experience if my surroundings weren't so busy. I mean, I would understand it's always packed because everything is delicious, but a normal noise level would have been nice.  If you don't mind that bit, this is a 5-star place to go for breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"Really good food and always have a fun time with the servers. Alexa was great today.....she was right on top with my crazy custom order - she even remembered my extra, extra side of mayonnaise."}
{"text":"Kristine was an amazing server she was friendly, prompt who explained the menu and gave wonderful suggestions!  I really enjoyed the decor and the food was delicious!!  Enjoyable morning!"}
{"text":"Best banana nut muffin in town. Great service, good food. Our first stop everytime we come into vegas."}
{"text":"We recently discovered Egg Works. It's our new Saturday morning tradition. Great menu variety, serving size and taste. Love the Diablo potatoes. Lisa C was extremely helpful and friendly. Food arrived in less than 5 minutes. We will see you again next week!"}
{"text":"Popular place on a Sat morning! The wait was quick. The staff was friendly. The selection was great! They were willing to make substitutions for me. Food was quick. Our waiter was Awesome!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and experience. Delicious food with very good service. That was our first visit to Egg works. Welcoming factor would be offering their new delicious Banana nut muffin. Ashley H served us and absolutely nice service."}
{"text":"the lady who seated us wasn't very friendly. I had the Mexican omelete and strawberry cream cheese stuffed French toast. the omelette was delicious! the French toast was good as well but it was drenched in whipped cream. I don't think it was really necessary and it was annoying to have to take all the whipped cream off. I also tried their sausage links, they were really salty."}
{"text":"I love Egg Works so hard. Any place whose regular menu items include green chile and chorizo is good in my book, but everything I've tried here has been delicious.   Also, I love that they allow for half orders. Additionally, I'm super picky about my steak, but their steak and eggs never disappoint. Also also also, many of their waitresses are tattooed cuties and nice as all get out. Finally, their bloody marys will kill you. In a good way."}
{"text":"Today was our first time here and OMG it was so good!!! Our server was Ethan and he was so nice and attentive to whatever we need. I'm coming back to this place! I love it!"}
{"text":"The service here is wonderful and everyone is super nice; BUT the food is mediocre at best. I LOVE breakfast and this place just doesn't satisfy. They do have AMAZING banana but bread muffin and their potatoes are perfectly seasoned #yum but Pancakes & French Toast are nothing special. Bacon is thin and greasy (it's the thickness and quality that are lacking grease is to be expected); sausage always comes pink and undercooked. Syrup can make or break you and I think it may be the syrup that throws me. I'd recommend Original Pancake House over this place any day and they are right around the corner."}
{"text":"Their food selection here is huge and definitely accommodates everyone. The staff is friendly and the service is really quick. Even at peak times in the morning you won't wait to long for a table. My favorite thing is their mash potato omelet & my husband loves the Loco Moco. Their pricing is pretty standard and it's a good around the corner breakfast place."}
{"text":"This place is cute! The food was delicious, they are very generous with their cheese and they melt it all the way though, as melty cheese should be! The portion sizes were just right. Our waitress was Chelsea, she was very perky in an inviting way, that makes you feel right at home, and she took very good care of us. I give it 4 stars only because it is no, \"Hash House A Go Go.\" It is by far one of my favorite family owned restaurant experiences. The staff was the friendliest, they have unique & delicious food with a large variety on their menu, and are extremely clean. I live in Orange County but will definitely be back when I'm in town visiting."}
{"text":"We went in today and had an amazing breakfast! Our server Michelle's was so awesome. Very attentive and had great advice when it came to ordering! Will definitely be back because of her great attitude and also the amazing food!!"}
{"text":"A wide, modernized-American style space, nice air, nice people, good vibe. Egg Works definitely has a good feel to it, which I think is absolutely critical for a breakfast place. The morning has to feel good, especially for the unfortunate noon-waking types.   The staff is friendly, though not spectacular (which they have the potential of being), but they do work efficiently and cleanly. The food is nothing too special; a little too rich, even for American food, and there's the unnecessarily huge servings of thick, saucy food even if you're expected to have morning-dessert afterwards. You could easily split an entree with someone else, and be happier in the end for it for not feeling so mayo-greased. I did appreciate how fresh the vegetables were, and the solid arrangement of the layers in my eggs benedict (which is important), but then the excess food and servings is just such a huge turn-off, especially when the flavors are so monotone that it all eventually becomes one huge unnecessary mouthful.   What I'd like to see is some more use of those excellent veggies and construction to create a bit more interest to the breakfast dishes. I'm not saying that they should be doing culinary acrobatics here, breakfast place and all, but they could stand to reduce sizes so that guests are not one-flavor-drowned, or to add a bit more interest to these huge dishes to warrant them being so size expansive."}
{"text":"I stepped in this place last Saturday and was pleasantly surprised. It was crowded, mid-morning, but we were seated in less than 10 minutes.  Our waiter was kind and courteous. I ordered scrambled eggs with pepper jack cheese, ham steak and their famous banana muffin. This meal was right around $10.  The food didn't take too long to come out. The muffin came put first. It was good, but would have been better if it was served warmed with butter. That would have kicked it up several notches..  My dish came out nice and hot. My eggs were so fluffy. Very memorable. Probably the best scrambled eggs that I've ever had. The cheese was perfectly melted on top. I was very happy about this because nothing pisses me off more than getting eggs with unmelted cheese on top..ugh... The ham was delicious. Grilled to perfection. Not too salty either which is the case with a lot of ham steaks that I've been served.  Egg Works was a hit with me. I look forward to dining there again.  Ps: I have public restroom phobia..but I appreciated the fact that their restroom was spotless during rush hour with only a few stalls available. I was relieved."}
{"text":"My waitress is Amy.  She is so pleasant & helpful. Had a great breakfast today!  This is my favorite breakfast stop when in Las Vegas. Highly recommend Egg Works as a great restaurant!  My waitress is Sandra.  Came back again today.  Wonderful experience all over again. This is my favorite breakfast eatery in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had some time before I had to go to another appointment and didn't have breakfast yet so I ended up here.  Sat at the bar for quicker service.  Got a banana nut muffin free because of yelp and it was the best part of my meal.  I ordered the corned beef hash and it just did not impress me; the hash it was like it came from a can.  Service was good.  Would I come back, maybe for the muffin."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast! On most days, the parking lot is pretty full... and you will see why! The staff is very welcoming and have no problem helping you. The ambiance is unique; lots of people chattering, yet cozy and comfortable. There are several seating areas: the main/center area, booths along the walls, darker and more private areas, as well as an outdoor area. There are also multiple TVs mounted on the walls. On each table, they also have the Bubba Gump style service where you flip the black/yellow egg and someone will quickly come and help you.  First off, their dishes are really big. Each dish can easily feed two people. If you are a smaller person, I would recommend getting a half order of something. My favorite dish on the menu comes from their small Hawaiian menu: Portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice. They also have perfectly made loco moco as well as the haole loco moco. My second favorite would be the Spinach Benny (eggs benedict, served with spinach plus hash browns, which is also very tasty). They have a variety of dishes: omelets, waffles, toast, scrambled eggs, crepes, parfaits... and that's just from their breakfast menu!  Overall, I give this place 5 stars, based on their menu, their staff, and their location."}
{"text":"Took the family out for breakfast Sunday morning of LDW. Had a 15 min wait to get seated, which is fantastic for a busy Sunday morning. Our waitress Veronica quickly came over to get our drink order and see if we had any questions. She recommended the Chile Relleno omelette for myself and the Avocado & Bacon for my wife.  The food was fantastic! The Chile Relleno may just be the best omelette I have ever had. My wife really enjoyed the Avocado and Bacon as well. We came in hungry and the portions didn't disappoint. Generous portions of seasoned potatoes along with the omelettes. My daughter also enjoyed her Mickey pancake.    Service = 5 stars Food = 5 stars Ambiance = 5 stars  We may have just found our new go to spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"Wow!  I am so impressed by this place!  I don't like going out to eat much, and especially not for breakfast because I'm usually disappointed.   So, when my BFF asked me to come with her to use her Groupon, I braced myself for mediocrity.  Boy was I surprised!  Our sever Dolly was so sweet, too. I was excited when I saw the chicken enchilada omelette because I never even thought about making that at home!  So, Dolly said it was amazing, and I ordered it with corn tortillas on the side (it just makes more sense, right?).  The Chicken  enchilada omelette definitely made my mouth happy!  I needed a bit more of their extra smoky enchilada sauce on the side, and the potatoes that accompanied were also equally impressive .I can't believe that the food was so well seasoned. Usually I need a whole lot of salt and pepper for the eggs and potatoes, but not at Egg Works!    The little happy and sad egg faces on the table were a nice touch,  too. As soon as I flipped to a sad egg  I had a sever coming over to check on me before I could even say \"egg works.\"  I like the concerted effort of all of the wait staff to ensure that every customer is pleased regardless of whether or not it's \"their station.\"  Yes, I will definitely be back in the future to try some more of their unique breakfast creations! I'm a HAPPY EGG!  :-)"}
{"text":"Quick courteous service. Generous and tasty food. All the positive comments about the banana nut muffin are true. Come here just for that."}
{"text":"Good locals breakfast spot. Seasoned potatoes are great and service was good. Clean and good place for family and friends. Middle of the road prices, breakfast for two with water and a side of pancakes was $30. Kind of high but the food was good."}
{"text":"First time here. Veronica was our server. Quick, efficient, and so friendly! Everyone on the staff looked like they were having fun. That's something I really appreciate. I had the Californian Crepe. It's was bigger than I expected. The potatoes are seasoned and a great compliment to the crepe. Don't forget to check in for your free muffin. It's worth it! I suggest asking for it in a box to have later because you won't have room to finish the plate."}
{"text":"Usually have a great experience at this egg works, due to there great food and customer service.  Unfortunately after this trip we had to end with some bad showing of customer service. I tried to get the cashiers attention and let her know how it was a great meal, but she did not acknowledge, she was a heavyset brunette with glasses.  I then asked if they had the local fire firefighter discount as my father was a fire chief, she smirked and said only while on duty, quite sarcastically.  We paid and made the best of her rude gestures while leaving, but besides the food this experience had left a horrible taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Quick service, good food, good times! Marc was our server this morning and he does his job excellently! Very polite, and very fast with our order and bringing out our food! One of our favorite new breakfast restaurants! Thanks Marc for the awesome service!"}
{"text":"In for the weekend from California for a concert and some fun, and we happened upon this gem ! Seated right away, coffee is second to none and the service was eggs-celent. I know, I know - I couldn't resist. But in all seriousness , best breakfast and lunch spot near Vegas. And Laura, our Waitress was so kind and accommodating! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Egg works is one of those packed for breakfast/brunch/lunch down home places that locals probably make a regular part of their weekends. I personally didn't really find there to be anything special about my meal which was a chorizo scramble. The chorizo was a little bland (shocking for the normally intense sausage it is) and my home fries were covered with so much seasoning a fan of salt such as myself couldn't really enjoy it.  Finally you have to pay up front and if you want them to split your check prepare to be the asshole that holds up the whole line for like 15 minutes. me and my friends were those assholes but honestly get more than one register, you probably seat 70+ people at a time and you can afford it."}
{"text":"FIVE stars for service. The food is great with good size portions. I liked their biscuits and gravy sauce. I do wish they had regular hash browns. There is so much more I want to try on the menu. I definitely recommend this joint for breakfast. They have something on the menu for everyone."}
{"text":"Wow!! The food was amazing, the prices are great since the portions are huge and the staff is super pleasant. The potatoes are amazing!! I really enjoyed the cute and cozy decor and the happy/sad egg for service is definitely cute. I wasn't sure how this place would be but I'm so glad that I went, they have really great food and it was very refreshing for a breakfast joint. Honestly, I don't feel that there are enough good breakfast/brunch/lunch places in Vegas but this is defintely at the top of my list for recommendations."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!!!!  This was my first time here. Our server Sy was amazing! Such great service and very attentive. The food was the best breakfast I've had in a very long time.  I recommend this spot if you love great customer service and excellent breakfast food!"}
{"text":"Vegas breakfast buffet?  We no need no stinking Vegas breakfast buffet!  You want the blackened prime rib benny.  That's an eggs benedict, but with prime freaking rib instead of ham and a croissant instead of an english muffin.  Yeah, the french do breakfast bread better than the Brits.  Compare that to a trough of scrambled \"eggs\" at circus circus.  Yeah, you won't get your three plates of bacon, but maybe that's a good thing.  They give you potatoes too, so that should be enough calories to work off your hangover.  Plus you get off the strip- that place has taken enough of your money.  So come to Egg Works and get something in Vegas that's actually worth every penny."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast. Be prepared to be hungry, their portions are big.  Staff is also great."}
{"text":"Kudos to anyone who does not have to take a box to go because the portions here are huge! It took us a while to sort through what we wanted to try, but we ended up with the fiesta skillet (with salsa and chili), the country fried steak skillet, and a cup of chili. The main orders also came with a banana nut muffin that the BF really liked. His country fried steak was much better than mine, and I think that was partly because the salsa didn't taste fresh (I envisioned something along the lines of pico de gallo, I don't know why) while his gravy was sooo good. So that would be my recommendation. The chili was fantastic too. We ended up taking half of each skillet, plus almost 3/4 of the chili home. And I swear we were hungry to begin with!  I think this is a great option if you are looking for more local food in Las Vegas that's off the Strip. Oh, we also found a buy one entree get one free coupon from a coupon book (the ones that you get anywhere on the Strip) that we forgot to use. Ugh."}
{"text":"Ashley was awesome. Love this place . Always yummy . If you haven't tried it put at the top of you next list . Cant wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"The breakfast is always great! My son loves the train that goes around the whole restaurant.  We love the fact that they always have a great variety of flavored creamers. The epoxy app the partner with for rewards is great and so easy to use !   But the real reason we drive up to anthem is to see LuAnna , she is great ! Always smiling and friendly and always has the menu knowledge to help with choosing new menu items we havent tried before  ."}
{"text":"Great place!   Service was great.    Our server was Rita    She was very prompt.  My husband and I took our 6 year old and when he asked for another scrambled egg Rita was happy to get him another one."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast. I had the Santa Cruz skillet.  If you are hungry and want a classic southwestern  breakfast it's very hard to beat this dish.  The banana nut muffin was also very good,  skip the toast and get this instead."}
{"text":"w h o a!  I love me some breakfast. I loved the banana nut muffin! It was so moist and fluffy. Didn't really need the butter, but couldn't resist adding it anyway.   The couple next to us both had skillets, so of course that meant I had to have one too. It's no Denny's skillet. The potatoes are so substantial, and seasoned wonderfully. The egg is dense and filling. Added bonus - everything stays warm while you work away. Too bad we couldn't take leftovers home to LA...the portion was so big I'd be eating for days..."}
{"text":"So glad that we found this place when we were undergoing a week long of continuous alcohol consumption in Vegas. Us girls were being obnoxious drunk bitches at 11am when we stepped into the restaurant, yet our lovely server treated us with much friendliness, even sitting herself at our table as we chit-chatted our way into placing our orders.   With her recommendation, I tried the corned beef hash with two eggs over easy. According to my memory under the influence, that corned beef hash was the best that I have ever had. With ample home-cured corned beef and perfectly cooked taters and eggs, I soon was under the spell of food coma. So, friends, come with an empty stomach, and prepare for a satisfying and reasonably priced breakfast in Vegas."}
{"text":"Eggworks serves excellent breakfast food! Great place to eat. Clean, affordable. Variety of menu choices."}
{"text":"If you know me, you'd know that I'm always craving country fried steak! I found Egg Works and made my sorority sisters go with me. Everyone seemed to really enjoy their meal (: Not even 10 minutes later our table was filled to the brim with food! Needless to say we all go to-go boxes at the end.   I love that they give you the option between toast or their homemade banana muffins. (go for the homemade banana muffins!)  If you are on the way to Vegas or just heading home to Cali, I highly recommend this place as a stop! The price is cheap, the quality is great, and the quantity is bountiful!"}
{"text":"Having breakfast with my sister before I go to work yummy our server Denis is very nice! Free muffin to take to work was nice surprise!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place when we want a quick breakfast. Food is good, service is good and environment is casual. Our server, Travis, was very friendly and inviting. Best service by far.  (And we come here often)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service (Michelle is the best!) and huge portions.  We come early Sundays (7-ish) I usually get the Santa Cruz breakfast burrito and my wife gets the garlic mash potato omelette and we rarely ever eat lunch after eating here because were too stuffed!   Chili is really good (go with the 5 way), blueberry pancakes....yum and the Asiago Scramble you can't go wrong.   Now.......i'm hungry!  :)"}
{"text":"Food is good and service was good. Food is more expensive than IHOP. Me and my wife returned several weeks later and she finds hair in her food. We will NOT return."}
{"text":"Solid option for breakfast. The portions are ample. Prices are good. Nothing really sets this restaurant apart from other breakfast spots though. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Egg Works does what they do well, which not every restaurant can claim. It's consistently good or great, but not amazing or excellent. Nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"This place always serves us great food and the service is wonderful! One time our food came out late and they constantly apologized and even gave us a nice discount.  They're always very polite.  The food is good! I've tried a or if things here and I have no complaints.  So glad this is close to home.  It has a nice homey feel.  I love how they offers a BOGO coupon in the LV Journal :)"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best place for breakfast or lunch.   They just added new items to their menu.  I tried the Pork Carnitas Burrito and it was really good.  Didn't post a picture because I ate too damn fast.   Our server Roslin is the best, she hooked us up with a great deal.  All you have to do is ask."}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast I've ever had. There is a reason this place has so many stars. Food is amazing... We tried the works potatoes and gumbolaya, both were great! Our server Ashley was awesome too, extremely pleasant and friendly, and great service despite how busy it was. Must go!"}
{"text":"Egg works is always great, we had the loco moco and absolutely devoured it. And of course the banana nut muffins were on point. Josh was our server and he was great, attentive and friendly.       We come here all the time and will continue to do so. Breakfast... The most important meal of the day, get it at egg works."}
{"text":"Good selections of food. Karen was our waitress and she is wonderful; no rush, gave good recommendation and kept checking up on us.   Food is a little pricey but overall is good."}
{"text":"we had a car and gf wanted to try a breakfast place because she needs her french toast. probably a 15min drive from the strip i ordered the waffle, light and crispy. was hoping it was a little bit more dense. came with 2 bacons gf wanted the french toast but she decided to go with the banana bread french toast she liked it alot but couldnt finish it because it was too dense. so of course i had to finish it i ordered a side corn beef hash. pretty damn good. had a southern twist to it when they added some peppers to it. not the typical type of corn beef from a can. pretty damn good hash i have to say  left very satisfied. great portions, reasonable price  and a plus, had 80's lite rock playing on the radio. SWEET!"}
{"text":"Heather the Server forgot to put in our order. Took a little long for our food but wouldn't of noticed. Manager and server apologized they were real cool tho. They pampered us to much we don't deserve this free egg work loaf of bread."}
{"text":"sat down at the bar. it was my first time here and was offered the famous banana nut muffin. service was fast and exceptional. my server cris was very welcoming and great personality. I'm definitely coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Came by here for a second time while the car was being worked on are server was Twila (as marked on the receipt) her service was good even though she had to come back to us 3 times because we were so indecisive about what to order and also wrangling a 7 month old and a 6 year old. She remained patient and friendly.  Overall food is okay nothing worth raging about had the Classic, the mouse pancake, the kids pizza, and the banana French toast. The kids pizza would probably feed 2 6 year olds and is a really good size for what you get. Good food is you aren't looking for any frills or surprises.  Hostess left more to be desired as I asked for a both and she ignored me the first time and when I repeated my self she pushed together a dirty table and a clean one.  Best part of the experience was Twila noticing our daughter was sucking on a piece of cantaloupe and noticed she was tearing it to pieces and brought us another one. Even though she forgot to bring the toast we asked for id give her a solid 4 stars good service attentive and patient everything I want in a server, also she did not charge us extra as many servers would to go half and half on fruit and potatoes on the classic which was definitely appreciated and will be reflected in her tip.  All in all a better hostess would have made this a bit better but as a no frills breakfast place it delivers and doesn't disappoint or wow."}
{"text":"There were a lot of people, but we got seated right away. Veronica, our server, had many large tables to serve, but she was incredibly attentive and helpful. We had the cabo burrito and the breakfast tostada which were fantastic. The only gripe I have is with the coffee which tasted awkward. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very casual environment with a very friendly staff. Donna was wonderful and very informative. Great service!"}
{"text":"Ashley is awesome! So helpful and understanding it made our breakfast a great experience make sure to ask for her.  Also the corned beef hash is excellent a new spin on a great classic."}
{"text":"I had a great breakfast this morning courtesy of McKensie . and the staff. Mackensie was super attentive, friendly, and quick! I recommend my favorite - - the Egg stuffed French toast!"}
{"text":"My server Amy was the best!  Great service !  She needs a trip to Disneyland! !!!  The banana bread french toast is the Bomb!"}
{"text":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME food!   After picking up our pup from a doggy hotel near the airport, we considered driving way back to \"The Egg & I\" for breakfast one more time.  By PURE LUCK, we saw a sign for \"Egg Works\", stumbled in and discovered that it was the SAME COMPANY.   Here's all you need to know:  1. No wait on a holiday Monday. 2. I am an eggs benedict officianado, and theirs was MAGNIFICENT.  The eggs benedict was probably the best I've ever had, and the \"ranch-style\" potatoes that accompanied it were fantastic as well. 3. The prices were very reasonable.  100% Guaranteed that I will come back to this place next time I'm in Vegas (unless we opt for the sister establishment The Egg & I which was equally good)."}
{"text":"Good food.  Fast service.  Well priced.  Tenikia, our server, was super friendly and nice."}
{"text":"The manager Amy is outstanding! I ordered a plate and substituted ham for spam and when my plate arrived it only had ham.  Long story short.. The manager amy came over and apologized for the inconvenience and went out of her way to keep checking on us for the remainder of the time we were there and fixed the problem i had with the meal.  The food was very tasty and service was amazing. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who has yet to try it"}
{"text":"Great place off the beaten path.  They have such an eclectic menu you will satisfy the pickiest eater.. when we arrived the place was packed and I think we only waited about 10 minutes.  Perfect because we were hungry.  We sat down and I was immediately drawn to the flip your egg concept( I love it) more places need this maybe even a red egg :).  I ordered the Blueberry pancakes and they were moist and fluffy.  They had that delicious made from scratch taste, my  sister had the Mexican Crepe, I loved the chorizo as it wasn't too powerful or salty.  My husband had an omelet that was a self creation and my brother in law had the boring standard egg, bacon and dry potatoes!.. oops did I say dry.  Yup that was the only thing I will not order for myself.   Everything was delicious the table service was on point and this is such a cute place with a great concept.  Now why the 4 estrella's! well.  They are a little pushy with bringing the check before you finish and cashier wasn't very pleasant is was like I was invisible and she didn't smile.  Sorry peeps I love a good smile!   ***** Food  ***** Service  ***** Ambiance  ** The famous potatoes ***** Location  *** The cashier"}
{"text":"This place is an oldie but a goodie! The servings are always decent sized and offer the opportunity to share or take home! The fresh baked muffins are super naughty because they come hot! The chili tells I omelette is my favorite item!"}
{"text":"The food is always freshly prepared and served in huge quantities! The muffins are sinfully good as they melt in your mouth! My favorite is the chili relleno omelette!"}
{"text":"I always come here, it's right down the street from my house. It is delicious every single time no matter what I order. Today James was my server and he was training a new girl. They were both so friendly and nice, but James was super awesome and helpful!! Love coming here, by far my favorite breakfast spot on the west side of Vegas!"}
{"text":"Banana nut muffin is a must!! The harvest walnut pancakes were fluffy and moist. The corned beef was delicious, but a little too salty. The loco moco was okay and this is coming from a Hawaii native. The gravy was mediocre and wasn't very flavorful. The service was great though. I wish I remembered our server's name. Will definitely go back, especially to claim my free banana nut muffin by checking in on Yelp ;)"}
{"text":"My wife & I went here during a recent stay in Vegas & had one of the most wonderful breakfasts in recent memory.  My wife had some amazing Pancakes stuffed with fresh bananas and chocolate chips (Special Request).  They were so delicious she didn't even add syrup.   I had the classic 2 egg breakfast with smoked honey bacon that was really good.  The prices are really reasonable as well I think our whole bill was around 14.00.  Well defiantly be going back here the next time were in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The long wait is always worth it, so don't let that deter you! The seasoned potatoes are a must have."}
{"text":"Called to pick up an order and the girl (I think her name is Diana?) was very polite! I had to call again to add onto my order and they were very patient with me.   I ordered a tuna melt with fries for me and a fresh veggie omelette (egg whites & add ham) with seasoned potatoes for the boyfriend. The portions are so huge, expect leftovers! The muffin is very delicious too."}
{"text":"We decided to eat breakfast at this place we order Cordon Blue for the wife and Stromboli Classic for me with Poached egg and fresh Avocado got a free banana nut muffin for checking in not bad at all for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Egg-cellent! Had the mimosa which was gigantic, and the spinach benedict. Perfect breakfast."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place! The restaurant itself has a very welcoming ambience.  It was bustling when I went (during noon).  The server I had was very friendly and made suggestions as it was my first time at an Egg Works.  I was satisfied with what I ordered though, which was their famous potatoes and French Toast.  Their hot sauce is a must too!  I couldn't get enough of it.  I recommend coming out here for brunch!  Their menu is expansive and there's always lots to choose from.. They've got everything from sweet waffles, to omelets, to pancakes, etc.  Pricing is also good!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of corn beef hash and this place does it right! Very moist and salty corn beef grilled with scrambled eggs, toast, and home fries. I have to say even the home fries had a nice spicy kick which I didn't expect. Be sure to use your yelp coupon for the banana nut muffin (it was delicious). Also, this place gets very crowded on the weekend so avoid during the 9am to 12pm if you are not keen on waiting."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best breakfast place in Las Vegas. I always order half of whatever I order because the portions are huge! I have a hard time finishing even the half size portions.   My boyfriend always gets the waffle works with over hard eggs and a side of works potatoes. I usually opt for the classic with over medium eggs, toast, and fruit. If you want to splurge, I highly suggest the chili relleno omelet.   Everything on the menu is great unless you catch them on a bad day. Today for instance, my over medium eggs were a runny, watery, mess.   The service is usually prompt, but don't expect to see your server again after you order."}
{"text":"A local friend suggested this place for breakfast and it was well worth the stop.  The skillets are big and tasty and the service was quick and friendly.  Also, the banana nut muffin served with the meal was tasty."}
{"text":"Let me tell you. I've been to Vegas several times. First time here for breakfast. We were seated quickly. Then the most awesome waitress Olivia came over to help us with a smile. The food was pretty good & service was great. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Our waitress Heather was awesome! This place is great with huge portions! Yum! I tried the breakfast quiche pizza and it was really good. The sunrise croissant sand which was delicious, pork carnitas with tomatillo sauce was fantastic!"}
{"text":"My wife rdered the blueberry pancakes which were old fashion and way too dense.  I fared only a modestly better with my easy over eggs, work potatoes and banana nut muffin.  I feel the food is overpriced in relation to quality though I eased my pain by using a printable 2/1 coupon found on the R-J website"}
{"text":"Love going to this place to eat breakfast. The service is great and the food is soooo good!! I love ordering the Chile Relleno omelette !!"}
{"text":"We got in fairly quick for 5 people on a Sunday at 11:30.  The menu had a lot to choose from.  Portions were large and prices were decent.  Service was slow and the food wasn't all that great.  Half the people in my party ended up feeling sick the rest of the day.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone I know as there is better places for breakfast."}
{"text":"Curtis our waiter was great. We didn't even have to flip our happy/sad egg face for service. Love the food. We didn't wait more than 5 minutes for our food to be brought out(and it was pretty busy)."}
{"text":"Breakfast IS the most important meal of the day. And in our valley, it seems that REALLY good breakfast joints aren't as abundant as one would like. Egg Works happens to be one of my favorites due to their friendly staff, comfy atmosphere, and most importantly, their fantastic selection of breakfast goodies. Their menu can be daunting to those of feeble breakfast tastes....but to a true breakfast maverick like myself, it is always a joy to peruse the menu on your hunt for a bellyful of wonderful. And you WILL get a bellyful. Large portions abound, from the fresh made muffins, to the skillets, omelettes, and all the other egg creations. Larger parties may have to wait to be seated, but good things come to those with patience. For those without, there is a fine McDonald's in the same parking lot. My latest trip there was last week and Donna was our server. She was spot on with getting my coffee, and although my dining companion was a bit tardy, she kept checking on me while I waited and enjoyed their delicious morning brew. Once my  cohort arrived, we ordered and were served our delicious meals shortly after. Halfway through, my buddy realized he didn't get his muffin. We asked Donna as she passed by about it and after a quick apology brought not one, but TWO muffins. One was consumed, and the other was taken home for a latter morning treat. Kudos to you, Donna, and your fine establishment.  :)"}
{"text":"First time here.   Nashay is our server.   She is very pleasant and helpful.   An excellent worker.  First we started with a muffin.  That was excellent.   The meal I had was a chicken fried steak skillet.    It was delicious.   The coffee was very good as well with little flavored creamers available.    Over all, this meal was perfect.    I will return again."}
{"text":"- What I loved about this place ...Excellent customer service  College football games were playing Pet friendly  Works Veggie Egg Benedict was great.   - the blackened chicken sandwich was ok. We will for sure dine at Eggs Work again."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is quick, and our server Tina was so sweet! she did so much more than you'd expect from a good server. Would DEFINITELY come back just cause of her exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Great service from Teresa! Muffins are fantastic! Try them when you visit."}
{"text":"Great service! Maria at the Flamingo location was kind, courteous and attentive! This was my first time to Egg Works and definitely will not be my last. The traditional Benny  was top notch. The egg was perfectly poached and the hollandaise was to die for. My fiancé got the banana nut French toast and it was just as perfect. Seasoned potatoes on the side, side of michelada... Perfection.   I'd recommend this place to any and everyone. Loved our server and loved the food. One of the best breakfast/brunch joints I've been to in a long time."}
{"text":"Their breakfast menu is awesome!  They even have a Hawaiian section.  On one visit, I ordered the Portuguese Sausage, and I posted a photo of it.  Also, the banana muffin and their banana bread is super D-LISH!!!  That's,...of course if you like banana bread.  =)"}
{"text":"***EDIT 2/10*** The owner reached out to me to ask who our server was to \"address the issue.\" Quite frankly they should address the issue that is themselves. I did not appreciate that they would want to throw their own staff under the bus when I called them out on inflating their yelp reviews.   AVOID. The owner has found a way to cleverly inflate their yelp reviews. They spend their advertising budget on their staff; by offering a Disneyland trip to the server with the most 5 star reviews. This is clearly a great way for the staff to solicit 5 star reviews based on service and not food. Sorry, but I'd rather have great food and shitty service than shitty food and awesome service.   When the metric is based of names in 5 star yelp reviews, how do you expect your servers to not solicit reviews? Or even mention it?  ***  This place has falsely inflated yelp reviews. I got duped into checking this place out and the food was no different from any other typical American diner breakfast places. Why such a low review? Food was mediocre. Ordered the avocado and chicken egg white omelet and it wasn't very memorable. The potatoes are generously covered in what was very similar to Lawry's seasoning salt. Also had the country fried steak skillet. The sausage gravy was good; aside from that I was not impressed with the food. The over easy egg was sitting in a puddle of grease and the egg white portions were rubbery.   Our server was patient and great and we got free banana muffins upon yelp check in. At the end of our visit, our server asked us for a 5 star review and asked for us to write her name in the review. Apparently the owner of this place will gift a trip to Disneyland to the server who convinces the most guests to write 5 star reviews. Hmmmmmmmmmmm.....  This totally works against what Yelp is for. A consolidation of reviews and ratings; this place does NOT have a 4.5 star rating for its food. I would consider it a 3 star place AT BEST. If it was correctly rated, I wouldn't have wasted stomach space and a meal at this restaurant.   If you don't believe me, take the time and read through the various reviews; you'll notice that majority of them will reference a server name, some of them talk about Disney or Disneyland trips. Frankly a restaurant smack out in Las Vegas should not have any references to Disney or Disneyland trips unless they were serving up Mickey Mouse shaped pancakes.   AVOID. (Unless you're a local and have plenty of opportunities to eat around Vegas and don't care for a wasted meal)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot off the strip. It's where the locals go, and for a good reason, the prices are very reasonable and the food is off the hook!! You get a huge yummy banana muffin with your meal. My bf got the country breakfast and he loved it. I got the blackened prime rib eggs benedict, and it's one of the best eggs benedicts that I've had. It's little pieces of steak on top of a croissant with perfectly cooked eggs. We also got a sample of the chili which was also delicious so we decided to order it to go since we were stuffed. It doesn't seem like you can go wrong with anything on the menu since this place really knows how to cook breakfast right.   Also, the staff is extremely friendly, very helpful, and patient. I can't wait to go back, and if you haven't been here, it's worth getting off the strip for an excellent breakfast!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Egg Works couldn't have been better. Came here for brunch and everything was amazing. Our server Hellena was awesome. Attentive, great personality, up sold me on the Bloody Mary and it was so great I had to buy the mix !! (4.99 for a huge bottle). If you stop at this location, ask for Hellena !"}
{"text":"Always GREAT SERVICE! ! Delicious food...prime rib benny is the Best. Sit at the counter. .no wait."}
{"text":"Amazing! No other words! The menu is so big it took me forever to make a selection. It was a quick wait while snacking on the muffins and then a filling breakfast that rivaled all other omelets I have eaten before this! Service is great and prices are good."}
{"text":"Ehhh. Nothing special. We've now been twice. First time, I was really excited to try the harvest pumpkin pancakes but they brought out regular ones. I asked if they were harvest, the lady who brought them out said yes, so I started to eat... But then when the waitress came around, I asked her if she was sure because they sure tasted like regular ole pancakes and she said, \"Oh whoops, no those are regular. Should I have the cook whip you up harvest?\" At that point I was almost full, husband was almost done, so it didn't make sense to order again. I was kinda done after that. It was nothing special and the one thing I wanted to try, they didn't even bring out correctly. With the zillion other places on Eastern, why return? But we found ourselves nearby again today, and my husband decided he wanted to try it again. This time I got a Greek scramble and he got a child relleno omelet. He basically licked his plate clean and I barely touched mine. Had to ask for toast to help balance the severe feta flavor in my scramble. A little feta is wonderful, and too much ruins a dish. Unfortunately, that's what happened. Oh well, at least they keep pleasing the husband. Probably won't be back if I have anything to say about it. :/"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed an awesome brunch with my son.... As always and as expected awesome food and great service..... Ethan was very attentive to us and even though it was near closing time there wasn't any feeling of being rushed or anything like that......"}
{"text":"It was ok, servers were nice.  I had the biscuits and gravy, it wasn't that great. My son had the French toast and loved it."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  On my way out somebody cut in front of me to check out and the cashier just right on let her do it.  Also for the money the food was way overpriced.  I paid $15 just for their crummy bare bones breakfast with two eggs two strips of bacon and hashed potatoes with coffee.  Not worth it for sure.  It's like a rip off.  For what I was paying for the food wasn't that great.  For what I paid it should of only cost $8.00 even with cash.  That way there would be more money left over for a tip"}
{"text":"Very friendly. Very good food.  Not one person asked us for a high review (like some suggest in other reviews.)  Country fried steak was really good  Biscuits and gravy were also really good  The only reason I don't think that it's a 5 star is because they don't have grits - I reserve 5 star ratings for places with grits!!"}
{"text":"Everything was so delicious! Marianne was our waiter. She was very sweet!   The eggs were so good.   Atmosphere was cozy and friendly.  We did not feel rushed at all."}
{"text":"First time here, Sunday morning.. VERY PACKED! Every single person working had a smile on their face, very happy to assist you. Had the pleasure of getting Chris as our server, he was very fast, also very attentive!! Great attitude and even threw in a joke or two (: not to mention he was very cute  will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Never fails... every Sunday we are here for breakfast and it never gets old! I love walking into a place knowing your going to get great food and great service everytime!  If you've never been here then you must try it! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best omelets on the planet earth. You can bring your dog sit out on the lanai. Fast friendly service. Two things missing Siracha and Splenda ."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the Egg and I their sister restaurant is a lot better.  Also I had some pretty bad service here my friend was done eat by the time I was finished."}
{"text":"Their banana nut muffin is the best! So moist and tasty! We got the fresh veggie skillet, and it ha did much flavor.  I recommend this place, excellent service and awesome food. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Eggs Works is ALWAYS great! Today Amanda was our server and she was fantastic too. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Donna was an awesome server and worked really hard! Our only complaint is the fried potatoes are really salty and over-seasoned. We had a really great breakfast otherwise and it was a nice little gem off the strip."}
{"text":"OMG Becky!  Looked for something good on Yelp while visiting and Yelpers did not disappoint. 8 knew as I was walking up to the building and saw all the local Nevada license plates on all the cars in the parking lot.  That Banana Nut muffin is ridiculous.  I had the Cordon Bleue skillet.  My Wife had the CornBeef hash. My Son had the Loco Moco, and our other Son had Stuffed French Toast.   Everything was Awesome, and huge portions. Only the 15year old finished his plate, those teenagers. Hahahaha. Service was on point. We had the Russian waitress. She was very fast and extremely friendly.  From the food, to the service, to the portion sizes, 5-5-5, PERFECT! Now off to the Strip!!!  Sorry no pics, couldn't contain myself when the food arrived........next time!"}
{"text":"i love coming to this place because they allow your dogs to sit outside and eat with you. everyone who works at this location is super friendly and not scared of the dogs and actually engage in conversation with you about your dog. as you can tell i'm all about my dog so i love this place"}
{"text":"I love the food! I have ordered almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed! We live in a community near by and we tell everyone YOU MUST GO HERE! On top of the food we have an awesome server ask for Chance and you will not regret it!  Her fun spunky attitude makes my family feel very welcome. We walk in, ask for Chance, the moment she see' s us we have our drinks , and moments later food. My daughter is normally a little fussy in restaurants but the vibe here and the staff make it comfortable even for the littles."}
{"text":"Although decent for a breakfast place, they're falling behind the times.  Usually coming here with my dad,  it seems to be the go-to breakfast place that hasn't adapted their menu.  No meaningful gluten free options. Nor organic eggs.  Most of their dishes are covered in cheese,  but all of them are from cows (the feta isn't even goat,  or sheep.... sorry lactose intolerant people!)  If you have any diet sensitivities or trying to eat clean,  give this place a pass. If they would come out of the dark ages with ingredients and quality,  this place would shoot up two or three more stars."}
{"text":"You'll rarely find me reviewing breakfast places, as my body has a tendency to not turn on my appetite until I've already been awake for two or three hours.  So coming from me, a four star review of a breakfast place is a great thing.  Egg Works helped me get my breakfast fix that I've been craving for the past week.  I have dined here before, but I saw Jen S. post his review of this place this past Friday, and that helped me decide where to get breakfast!  So on those rare occasions when I do breakfast, I love me some eggs benedict.  So I decided to love me some eggs benedict through Egg Works' \"Works Veggie Benny,\" which their menu describes as, \"English muffin grilled brown, topped with grilled tomatoes, fresh spinach, sliced avocado,two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce, sauce then we serve it with a side of Works potatoes.\"    First things first: the Works potatoes are amazing.  I will eat potatoes in any form, whether it be baked or mashed or anything in between, and the Works potatoes are at the top of my list.  They are crispy on the outside but maintain that starchy softness inside, and are served with a salt/spice seasoning that make these taters into little breakfast fries.  The Works Veggie Benny itself was good.  The avocado and tomato sounded delicious and refreshing, but was overpowered by the hollandaise sauce.  I think one of the poached eggs \"popped\" prematurely and got yolk mixed in with the hollandaise, leading to a soupy consistency that smothered my veggies.  Not a bad thing, but I wasn't used to my hollandaise being so runny.  Outside of that, the food was delicious, though I think next time I'll be going with a Benny that has some bacon or sausage to go with that sauce.  The meal also came with a slice of watermelon and honey dew; fruit is always a pleasant way to round out your breakfast.  My friend got the Spinach Benny, and we both got coffee, which led to a bill of $25 for the both of us.  Each entree was just under $10, with the coffee being about $2.50 or so.  I am definitely coming back here again, I just can't guarantee when!  Once I try some of their skillets, scrambles, omelets (they have quite the menu!) I have no doubt that my four stars will be bumped to five."}
{"text":"Something a little different if you want a quick breakfast, and are sick of the typical chains.  Extensive menu, and everything that passed by looked good.  No complaints from any of my dining partners either.  AND they serve bloody mary's and the like in case one is in need of a morning after drink.  Good prices, and FAST service.  Not great service, but friendly and fast.  We had to stop the servers to ask for things.  But overall a good breakfast.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very quick service and large portions. I like the happy egg and the unhappy egg indicator when you need something. Any team member will stop to help. A solid experience."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice cheery feel. The service is very friendly. I am not sure if they are always this busy but it was hopping when I got there for lunch. This is basically a good old American food place for comfort food. As such, I got country fried steak. I have no idea why they call this a steak? But it was delicious. The chicken was fried crispy and drenched in tasty gravy. The way my mom would make, if she knows how to make it. There was a large heaping amount of eggs and potatoes. It's big enough to share but I didn't. I ate it all. I love gravy. It was just the right consistency, not lumpy or runny. If you don't know where to go to eat, just eat here. Plus I got a free muffin when I checked in. Score."}
{"text":"The breakfast was very good. The eggs were cooked right which is sometimes difficult with 'over medium' eggs. The service was great, the waitress was very attentive. The food came in a timely manner and the order was correct, which seems to be a problem for me normally at breakfast places.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"A great local breakfast place! Fresh eggs, pancakes & bacon are always worth the stop here. The buttermilk pancakes were tasty and a nicely large size. They also have other fun options instead of breakfast foods, such as Cincinnati chili. The restaurant is bright & clean with the service being fast & friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in town.  Service is friendly and the place has a diner feel which I love being from the East coast.  Everything is homemade with lots of choices including healthy options.    My favorites are bacon and onion skillet, sunrise mountain and Sundance omelette."}
{"text":"Well this morning I decided to try something new walked in with my husband and we were seated promptly seem like a nice place looked at the menu and we're kind of shocked over the high prices for breakfast two cups of coffee $6 eggs bacon and hash browns $10 after ordering and eating with a coupon which basically did nothing to the bill.. our total bill for breakfast came to $26 and did not even include the tip which I gave to the nice lady that served us.. sorry to say the breakfast wasn't that great and very overpriced there a lot of other breakfast places in town and I will probably never go back"}
{"text":"Large portions, friendly staff, clean environment but what I come here for is the homemade ultra moist banana nut muffins!  My family eats a loaf in one sitting, will need to buy more when I return to lv next month."}
{"text":"We've bee here two times already and both times, we've had a great experience. The food is delicious, the service is phenomenal and there hasn't been a wait time either of the times we went. I highly recommend you taste their banana nut muffin. It's fresh and very yummy. Will definitely be coming again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food was great but the service was even better. If you are lucky enough to have Donna serve you, you have to take her suggestion of the Veggie omelet with Avocado! It's amazing and so is she!"}
{"text":"Been here at least twenty times and never had a bad (or even mediocre) experience. While mainly a breakfast oriented place, they have quite a few other choices such as sandwiches, burgers, chili, Hawaiian, and Mexican fare. The Buffalo Chicken wrap is really good.  Reasons I would recommend: Great location Clean Atmosphere (train circling above is a great touch) Very friendly staff Knowledgeable wait staff (very attentive) Outstanding food quality and taste Extensive menu choices  Dog friendly patio"}
{"text":"Perfect atmosphere and food prep.  Excellent for filling up on no carbs.  4 egg  \"The Works\" omelette with fruit and cottage cheese on the side.  Whoa!  Love this place."}
{"text":"It was delicious and the waitress had a great attitude. The only thing the potatoes  were overly seasoned. It was great service for our large group."}
{"text":"House made corned beef hash with eggs was great. Not greasy or fatty. Eggs were fluffy. Wish their orange juice was fresh squeezed for the cost, but the food was so awesome they still get 5 stars. Will definitely be back. Potatooooo"}
{"text":"Every time we come the service is prompt and courteous.  We had Nicole E again as our server and she is phenomenal.  Super nice and checks on you just enough."}
{"text":"Soooooo good! Food was fantastic!! Our server Veronica was one of the best servers we have had in quite some time. She needs a raise and vacation!! Place was packed but we were seated fast! The kitchen cooked our food to perfection. Compliments to the chef! Would highly recommend this place for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Usually don't do breakfast outside the house, but today I said \"what the heck\" and went for it. I chose Egg Works and I'm glad I did. The second we walked in, our server, Nick, welcomed us and directed us to our table. He was great throughout. Very southern atmosphere in the restaurant, food, music, etc. Overall great experience and definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Very satisfied coming here. Did not wait a second to get seated and the ladies up in the front complimented my hair. Love them! Got seated and immediately got asked for drinks. The menu is really cool, it's a newspaper. Very creative. The server and waiter were very nice and on it. The food was delicious and the portions are huge. They kept hot coffee on the table. The coffee was amazing. So I highly recommend this place. I got the Mexican omelette..... I'm Mexican so I expected more as you couldn't really taste real chorizo. They have outside seating. Come here on your next Sunday!"}
{"text":"luv this place. its so delish. their seasonings are so darn good. you need to try this place. for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent staff ! Rob is always helpful,  kind and efficient. A great Saturday morning tradition!"}
{"text":"I really wanted this to be better.  I had opted to go here because Blueberry Hill had a huge waiting list, plus the reviews looked good so we tried it.  The server was super nice and food came out quickly - both great signs.  The food however was just a little lacking.  The pancakes were dry and my Mexican egg dish was just so so.  The potatoes, while plentiful, again were just ok.  Would probably not return here again.  Next time, I will just wait at Blueberry Hill."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on 6/10/12 and had a bad experience. I ordered the island breakfast plate with the Portuguese Sausage, Eggs and Rice. It was underwhelming and the plate looked like a picture with an abuse of negative space. The hash browns came out looking like they were a frozen product. A restaurant specializing in breakfast serving me something that looks and tastes like a frozen product is a bit of a pet peeve for me. Our toast was burnt, refills took too long, I was left wanting for a straw but our server disappeared. We got more service from the guy busing tables. We had the sad face egg up and finished our meal before anyone paid attention to us.  It'll be a while before I return."}
{"text":"Service was awesome. Thanks Ashley ;) Food was delicious. Definitely will be back. Went to other location on Sahara yesterday. This  one is much better. Better layout. Will go there for now on. Here again today. Just heard uou have loyalty app. Btw, Jessica was awesome too. ;)"}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey side for breakfast but you won't be disappointed.  Their sausage makes it all worthwhile, but all the food is first rate.  Among my favorite breakfast spots in town."}
{"text":"THE BEST BREAKFAST! any place that offers chili in a omellette...i am interested!  the portions are GINOURMOUS so ask for a half order if you are not starvin!  the service is quick and friendly, i am there 2-3 mornings a week! try the H U G E breakfast burrittos. yummy my fav!"}
{"text":"They were pretty busy for a Monday breakfast and they still sat us under 10 minutes. I ordered the works skillet, perfect size portion and great flavor! Well worth the price, ill be back."}
{"text":"Second time we've eaten at Egg Works while visiting Vegas.  This place is yummy, good service and quick getting your food.   Our waitress DONNA was awesome!!!!  Don't forget to order a homemade banana nut muffin... They're to die for......"}
{"text":"Egg works does a great breakfast. The service is efficient and I have found it to be consistent at their other locations as well.  I only give out 5 stars to places that really go above and behind and are a bit more creative. So 4 stars to them is not a slap. Their food is tasty and I probably eat there for breakfast once a month.  Their prices are reasonable too, especially for people that need a little hair of the dog.  The last time we visited I notice that they also have some Hawaiian specialties; I have to say that I really liked the Loco Moco!  I can't wait to try the new location! Keep up the great grub!"}
{"text":"Bomb bomb bomb! So worth everything about this place! The eggs are fresh and delicious  the drinks are amazing and the servers are so nice! Very highly suggested."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast/brunch/lunch. Their waffles are so soft and you can choose to add fruite and whipped cream. I then discovered their Huevos Rancheros, its a tortilla on the bottom the skillet, topped with beans, two eggs any style, salsa, delicious melted cheese and a dollop of sour cream. Usually it'll come with homestyle potatoes but i choose to substitute it with seasoned fries, my favorite.   My friend ordered the Stuffed French Toast, which is basically a sandwich made out of two pieces of french toast and stuffed with fluffy scrambled eggs, also a side of the works potatoes.  If you ever need anything from your server, the easiest way to get their attention is to flip over the egg on the table. Its that metal container that holds all the sugars, jellies, and hot sauces, and it has a metal egg you can flip over to the yellow side and it will let your server know you need them."}
{"text":"Wonderful Place For Breakfast/Brunch!  Place Is ALWAYS Clean!  Our Waitress Sophie Has Mastered AWESOMENESS ! As Far As Service Goes, Definite 5 Star Service!!

If YOU Are Looking For Delicious  Quality Food and Extremely Efficient, Friendly  Service, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND EGGWORKS ! Enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"I travel to Henderson quite a bit, and every time I make sure that I stop into this fantastic restaurant.  From initial greeting and seating to the service to the food, nothing here merits anything less than 5 stars.  Service is always amazing, but even that pales in comparison to the food.  Generous portion sizes and large glasses of beverage keep me coming back for more.   I highly recommend their ranch wrap and buffalo chicken wrap paired with the potatoes."}
{"text":"The food are good and the service are great special the waitress name Roslin in eggwork flamingo"}
{"text":"This hidden place was actually delicious for breakfast or brunch! The service was on it & the prices were great for people on a budget! Def going back"}
{"text":"This place is always crazy busy, but that never seems to mean the service isent great, the old fashion train station atmosphere is strange to me. They give you a beat up and stained  paper menu.  The food is great tho i had eggs Benedict. There pancakes are average, nothing special, the best part was the potatoes!! The husband and i were fighting for the last little bits. I definitely Will be back!"}
{"text":"Brady was our server today HE WAS ASWOME Love the hair. :) a bit of a wait but that is to be expected. Staff is always friendly doesn't matter what spot we go to we have been to 3. Had to flip our egg because our katcup was empty not even one sec someone was helping. Love this place."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here. Portions are generous and very tasty. This is not a greasy spoon kind of place. Eggs were not swimming in oil.  I couldn't find an egg white option, but I asked and they accommodated me.  Our server, Rosey, was fabulous! She brought us banana nut muffins to try and they were delicious! My son ordered pancakes and a couple sides, so Rosey recommended that he change his order to be a combo meal and substituted the items in the meal to be his sides. This saved us a few $.  Definitely will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Egg Works. Through the Yelp app we were able to get a free banana muffin just for checking in!! Our AMAZING server Amy L. Was very helpful in redeeming the coupon as well as providing us with any information about the food. I would definitely recommend this location specifically for the great customer service we received today. Thankfully it's close to my house so I now have a wonderful breakfast place to eat!!"}
{"text":"My mom, best friend and I were looking for a good place to have breakfast on a Sunday morning. I remembered seeing this place on my drive home one day and decided we should give it a try. The parking lot was packed, so we were afraid there would be a long wait. To our surprise, we got seated right away. That was a plus since we were all starving.  My friend ordered the corned beef hash and it was amazing! It was different from any other corned beef hash I have ever had. My favorite for sure. My mom ordered the fruit plate, which was huge! They serve it with either cottage cheese or yogurt. It looked amazing and the fruit was very fresh. The only thing I would have changed would have been the portion of cottage cheese. It just wasn't enough for the amount of fruit. I ordered a bacon avocado egg white omelet. It was amazing. Plenty of avocado, which I love. I would highly recommend it.     All in all, this was a great meal. My mom keeps asking when we're going back!"}
{"text":"Been there a couple of years ago and it was good. Went again today and the service and the food was awful. The servers all seem to be visiting with one another or friends, our server was so busy watching someone else while she took our order, my wife's pancakes came smothered in Readi-Whip. I had the Country Benny and the gravy was so laden with salt I felt sick on the way home. When we went to pay another server was visiting the cashier and I was told I could walk around her to the other side, plus there was no question as to how our meal was and after paying not even a Thank You, please come again, no need to ask because we will not be coming again.....3 hours later and I can still taste the salt."}
{"text":"Egg works or eggs don't work because my eggs tasted like they had been poured from a box won't go back"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Sitting on the Patio made it better. Juan was our waiter extremely helpful. Great service. Super nice. Would highly recommend here. Shout out to Juan."}
{"text":"Went with my daughter and Ryan. Ryan had souped up biscuit  and gravy, and I a prime rib benny. Only had to wait 10 minutes. The company made this a delicious meal#"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places: the location is inviting surrounded with lovely shade tr=s; but the food is in itself delicious,  plentiful,  and satisfying.  I usually get the Sunrise Mountain because I love having a s I ft, flaky croissant to go with my eggs. Today, however, I wanted to try something different.  John, our server, understood my indecision and gave me time to consider my options without trying to rush me.  When I finally decided on the steak and eggs, it came out promptly, and most importantly, still warm, made as I wanted it. John was courteous and respectful. Once we had been served he checked on us occasionally,  but didn't rush us out. We will return to his,section again."}
{"text":"Very very good place.. Manny was so nice and really went above and beyond.. Banana Muffin THE BEST!!!"}
{"text":"I took my family here for the first time. Food was great and our server Denis was so nice and pleasant too. We definitely will be back again:)"}
{"text":"Got seated right away, sat for 15 minutes and no one came to even take a drink order or to even say ill be right with you... I got up and left. The worst."}
{"text":"This may sound inappropriate but their house potatoes are so delicious they must be sprinkled with crack. I mean how the hell can potatoes taste that good? The stuffed French toast is a must and their banana muffin defines heaven. I'm finding that I'm frequenting this place every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not the most amazing food in the world but it's reasonably priced and very good. The parfait could be layered better for mixing. The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful. Would definitely recommend this place and we will be back the next time we are in the area and hungry for breakfast food."}
{"text":"Went today for a Valentine's treat. When it wasn't that busy I was delighted. As soon as we were seated the guy says \"what do you want to drink GUYS\"? We were going to order a Bailey's coffee or one of the other special drinks but he was rather huffy. So we rushed to say water please. He sped off. We looked at each other and said I hope he's NOT our waiter. Wrong, he was. He returned with the water and said are you ready GUYS? WE only found his name out because he told the \"guys\" (which was a table of 4 ladies) behind us it was \"pK\". We must of heard him say guys 35 times while we were there. Ok FOOD..'... that was brought out by someone else, no biggie. $9.95 for a club additional $1.95 for it to come on a croissant. No mayo, mustard nothing. It looked AWESOME. But was dry. And the heart skillet something, was just that. Something! So so gravy oily potatoes. We only ate half of both. Our waiter returned NEVER ASKED IF THINGS WERE OK? Just said once again, \"here guys, thanks guys\" dropping the bill. We didn't even know to pay up front. We will NOT return!! Thanks \"Paul\" \"pK\" and the kitchen staff for a not so nice Valentine's day treat."}
{"text":"This is a great place for family friendly breakfast, brunch, or lunch.  Nice big layout with lots of tables so the wait is not typically long.  We have had yummy banana nut muffins, waffles, mashed potato omelette, pancakes, eggs benedict, traditional breakfast, and more.  The service is always fast, friendly, and helpful.  There is even a big room in the back for parties and large groups. This has become a Sunday brunch favorite!"}
{"text":"So amazing! I get the veggie benny with Chipotle hollandaise sauce instead of the regular one, & the other meal on the table is stuffed French toast! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly and the food is always good!  My husband and I walk our dog here most weekends  for a relaxing brunch on the patio."}
{"text":"Great breakfast restaurant!  Very clean and the staff is excellent.  The menu has everything you could ever want!  And to top it off...the coffee is good too!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with the service here today. It seemed to be an unusually Wednesday by the looks of the parking lot but less than half of the restaurant was full. When greeted at the door it was more of an afterthought by the three hostess standing there.  I had to repeat twice that it was a table for one bc they were too busy talking to each other. I knew what I wanted when I came in (banana French toast) and found it on the menu and flipped my egg to yellow that I was ready for service.  The first girl came over and asked if she could help. I told her I was ready to order. She said she could take me drink order and disappeared to get me a hot tea. Two more gentlemen came over to ask if they could help me. Again I repeated I was ready to order. They said she was coming. The tea girl meanwhile brings back my tea and flips my egg back to black. I flip it back to yellow bc I STILL need to order. The waitress finally comes over to take my order. No apology that sge was busy or anything. I give her my order and she flips my egg back to black so hard the table shakes. Very disappointed. Will be some time before I am back again"}
{"text":"Very nice place and wonderful service. The food here is excellent. Their egg salad sandwiches are YUM. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"First timers!  Sooo glad we found this one. Hash was awesome--ACTUALLY HOMEMADE!!!  Banana nut muffins BEST we have had hands down. Wife had a two egg omelette that was still huge. ROBERT has only been there 4 weeks but seemed like he has been there forever. HIGHLY recommend him and the food!"}
{"text":"This place was busy. We sat at the counter to avoid the wait for a table. PK was our server.  He was quick to greet us, get our waters,  coffees,  and put our order in right away. He was funny and made me smile. (Not easy to do lol) Excellent service!!!the food was fast and delicious!!! I gotthehash and eggs over medium.  Cook to perfection. My husband got the greek omlet. The muffins are soooooo good! Warm and fresh! I highly recommend this place. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Good place for traditional breakfast or brunch got a free banana nut muffin with my order with the Yelp coupon. I had with a corned beef hash , which was good but I found it on the salty side. My server did let me know when I ordered it that some people do find it salty. All in all though the eggs over easy were spot on and the potatoes or very good as well. The service might be considered slow, but when taking into consideration how busy the place was I think they did a fine job. A nice place for Sunday brunch, breakfast with friends, or some good food after a night out or a morning at the gym. The menu will accommodate all."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Eat here a lot and everything is good. I used to get the moco loco and it was awesome. Since I've gone gluten free I usually get the Mexican omelette or the huervos rancheros. The Mexican omelette is chock full of jalapeño so be prepared. It's hot but very flavorful. I get the huevos with corn tortillas and the taco meat. If you don't ask for the meat you won't get it so be prepared. Service is good and the floppy eggs to let them know you need help is awesome"}
{"text":"Came here on a lark b/c of the good Yelp reviews. This place did not disappoint. The food was delicious, the service great and you shouldn't miss their homemade muffins"}
{"text":"Spinach Benny amazing, I like to get it with turkey sausage and half fruit half potatoes. Potatoes are amazing and unlike any other breakfast joint! Flavorful and crunchy, Shantel was awesome today too, always a must to stop by here when we're in town"}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast or lunch. The food & servers (Tamara & Denis) are always amazing!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of talk about Egg Works from some friends so we decided we would hit the place up before flying out. To be honest here, after spending all day yesterday around the strip our group may have been a little hungover upon waking up, so what's better than a greasy breakfast?   I was told the muffins are amazing so with my breakfast I had to get one, it was pretty good, very soft and moist. I ordered the chicken fried steak skillet which had their house potatoes, cut up chicken fried steak, gravy, and 2 eggs on top. And to drink I chose to get a mimosa and water. The mimosa was cute, they served it by providing a Mason jar glass with a mini champagne bottle and a cup of OJ on the side so you're to mix it yourself. Fine by me, it just means I could control how much of each to make mimosa just right for me. We came as a party of 4, coffee was ordered and we were without coffee cups for about 10 minutes or so. When our food was brought to the table all other 3 dishes were brought expect mine, it was about another 5 minutes. It really seemed like they were confused about the orders coming out and had to get it sorted. When I did get my food, it looked great and didn't taste too bad. The only thing on the food quality that I wasn't a fan of was how salty it was, the potatoes had a seasoning on them that was good but it was a little too much and really made the whole dish too salty since it was all basically mixed together in the skillet. The gravy was pretty tasty though, and the chicken fried steak was about average. My reason for a 3 star review was the delay in the food all coming together along with the coffee cups, there was a chip in my glass that was overlooked, and the table hadn't been bused all the way so the previous guests tip money was still on the table, and of course the salty food. I wouldn't be opposed to coming back, but I wouldn't really go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"Wow, this place just does breakfast right. If someone was looking for a template on how to make a great breakfast diner, they should look no further than egg works.  First the service... they have a egg smiley face at your table that you can turn into a frowny face if you need immediate service. If you make it a frowny face, your server will come almost immediately. I've really never needed to use this however because our server almost always has checked in on us at good times.  Now the food. Holy crap is this stuff good. If you're dieting, don't go here because it's too tempting. I would reccommend something, but really everything is good. Make sure to get a side of potatoes because they're fantastic and seasoned very well.   If you haven't been here yet and you live in Vegas, go! If your not in west Vegas, try the Egg and I, it's by the same people and the experience is basically the same."}
{"text":"Always a treat and they never disappoint. Great service and worth the wait.y family visits this restaurant every trip to Vegas. Oh and check-in on Yelp when you arrive and you even get a FREE warm banana muffin. Thanks Eggworks!"}
{"text":"Came here after seeing all the great reviews and was not disappointed. Absolutely delicious. The potatoes are fantastic. I'll definitely be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"My server was Blaze.  She was amazing!   I wasn't happy at the table we had and she was so awesome and understanding and moved us.   Thank you for making my special breakfast with my son so enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointed! Ive been coming here for years and the quality seems to consistently get worse.  A lot other new places opening that are way better. Ordered the homemade  corned beef hash with eggs over medium...ill just say I'd rather eat the canned stuff.  The eggs were over cooked.  Our server disappeared after she took our order and we didn't get our order for over 30 mins AND they forgot the muffin. If this is being read by an Eggs Works manager...im sorry but the quality and service during my last FEW visits have been subpar compared to your completion..we have officially decided to never come back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Awesome server!! We had a group of 8 of us come to breakfast and majority were children 6 and younger our waitress Veronica was great with the kids and very patient she made our visit and breakfast that much easier! Thank you Veronica!!"}
{"text":"EGG WORKS IS AMAZING! I haven't even had a bite of my food yet and the customer service is phenomenal! Michelle our waitress was so happy to be there and serve us and explain the menu to us! Love it! Even if the food tasted bad( which it didn't), I would have stayed and gave them 5 stars. Locals and tourist alike will love this Las Vegas Breakfast joint! It's a must eat for those just wanting to have good food and service. Thank you Egg Works!"}
{"text":"EGGS-ACTLY what you want!!!!   PARKING: FREE in the complex PLACE: clean, big space like barn WAIT TIME: 10-15 minutes MENU: comes at the newspaper form  MEXICAN influenced breakfast place, family owned. You will find poached eggs, omelettes, scrambled, skilled breakfast, egg-crepes, Hawaiian Loco Moco, wraps, burgers, sandwiches. They also served Mimosa, Habla Diablo Michelada (red beer).   CHILI RELLENOS OMELETTE: a whole green chili stuffed with Cheddar and Jack cheese, folded over in a four egg omelette topped with Habla Diablo Original salsa, Cheddar and Jack cheese, fresh cilantro and sour cream (warm, not spicy at all, huge portion)  Served with Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes (a bit too salty, they put tons of SALT) and banana nut muffin (warm semisweet fluffy).  COFFEE: All you can drink!  SERVICE: friendly, a bit slow on taking order and getting the foods out, fast on giving bill.  RESTROOM: the sign is not restroom, but OUTBARN (I was spending a good amount walking around the whole restaurant to find the restroom).  In overall, good place to visit for hearty breakfast with Mexican touch menu. The place is quite famous for breakfast amongst Vegas native.   Notes: no separate checks, non-smoking restaurant   EGG-CEPTIONAL!!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went here on Father's Day. Had never been here before and got seated after just a few minutes. I noticed how the food portions were very generous, so we split our food choice. An egg scramble with seasoned potatoes. The food arrived in a timely manner...and heated perfectly. The oj was delicious and our server was personable and attentive.   We will definitely be back !!!"}
{"text":"I love egg works. They are friendly staff. The food is typical of a diner but you can taste the quality. The moco loco is amazing choice. Not the nicest looking place but you pay for what you get."}
{"text":"I had the awesome opportunity to eat breakfast here during a recent visit to Vegas. The breakfast menu rocks - The food is absolutely fantastic and the portion sizes are Huge!! The muffins we were presented with were also great - Out waitress - Donna Henry - Made us feel like the royal family when we were there. She was very attentive and really worked hard to make our visit memorable.  The only bad part about this place is that they dont have a EGG WORKS on Long Island in NY. If they did - this place would kill and the owners would be very wealthy!!!! HINT HINT!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here and wanted to try their popular diablo potatoes. They were delicious, and they had a variety of egg dishes ! I got the french toast egg sandwich it was savory and sweet and came with side of potatoes. The muffins are also AMAZING and free when you do a yelp check in ! ^.^ ! The service was awesome and the decor was super cute. I would love to come back and try some of their other dishes. But for the most part it was a solid brunch/breakfast spot .. great for family and locals."}
{"text":"OK so first off this is a very popular place when I ate here it was very busy. In fact it was so busy I felt like I was at some government service office. Screaming babies lots of people cluttering the aisles. When i first came in I went to use the restroom,there were a ton of un-bused tables not very attractive or sanitary. My waitress was  helpful but over the top fake customer service. Now to the food....why doesn't anyone know how to make a proper hollandaise sauce? Powder mix all the way,average bordering on not really good at all. And the potatoes they serve,omg.They had more salt then the dead sea...easy with the salt moses your killen me. I felt like i was getting hyper tension with each bite.Then I go to check out,lady behind the counter doing something counting receipts finally looks up at me and says how are you,im fine. she goes back to doing what she was doing...lol ..ok np ill just wait for you dear. Please give me five singles as my change ,she hands me a 5...here take this 5 and put it towards a new hearing aid.....this place might be ok to soak up a hangover but other then that mediocre at best...pass."}
{"text":"All 6 members of the family agreed that this place is bomb diggity!! We ordered the butterscotch pancakes, works skillet, works omelette, crazy chicken omelette, veggie sunrise omelette and egg Benedict with gravy.  Everything tasted great, the portion sizes are big, we had a lot of left overs. I would recommend sharing if you are not a big breakfast eater.  Their banana muffins were soft and moist, I definitely would come back if I'm ever back in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"Went to Egg Works for breakfast this morning; It was jam-packed! My wife and I were greeted and sat down immediately. Even though the restaurant was packed, the service was amazing! Food was served promptly and was excellent! Every time my wife and I eat there (at least once every two weeks) we have a great experience. Keep up the great work! We greatly appreciate the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Located close to Red Rock casino and Costco. Great for families and dog owners. Tremendous great taste,  quality, prices and selection. Recommend stopping here for breakfast before you head out for your morning hike"}
{"text":"We had a good birthday breakfast for my boyfriend, and Chelsea was very friendly and very pretty. Normally we always go to the 215 and west side location but next time we will come back here."}
{"text":"Came in really early and I was immediately welcomed by VICTORIA, loved the service and her food recommendation."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. Great omelettes and the service is always excellent. Despite being crowded the vast majority of the time, the wait is never too bad. Plus, try allow small dogs on their patio, which we love."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the food is great. Just moved from LA was looking for a good breakfast spot and this spot is it. Caitlyn (might be spelled wrong) was our server she was the best server I have ever had. Always checking in on the table answered my silly questions (why is one location named different to why do u have these things that slide over the top) she explained it all. She was always smiling. If I was her boss I would send her to Disneyland for Christmas she deserves it. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"The food and the servers are always great! Donna is the absolute best!!! Great French toast! Nice break from the workday to go eat breakfast."}
{"text":"Twila was the best. Awesome service...took time out to  get to know a little about us etc...checked on us often making sure we had everything and making sure we were happy. Never had a bad food experience here. Food is always excellent."}
{"text":"Arianna is awesome! She was very friendly and her service was impeccable. The food was also excellent as usual. 5 stars in all regards."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Device was great. Don't forget to order the banana nut muffin instead of the toast."}
{"text":"Extremely noisy environment but should be expected from a family location. It took an hour for us to receive our food (one of the worst feelings in the world is watching people who were sat well after you, receive their food first). They had apparently \"lost\" our ticket in the window. They did pay for our drinks (one mimosa and two orange juices), but overall, we were tired and not looking to wait around an hour for sub par food. Two stars for our server who was a nice guy and tried to make the situation tolerable.   I'll go to The Cracked Egg down the road 10/10 times."}
{"text":"Always amazing service. Fantastic menu items. Ask for Travis hes the man!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for post-Vegas recovery. The menu is gigantic and so extensive and everything sounds so freaking good! I decided on the Veggie Bennie because I love avocado and it was great. I asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side which was probably a smart move because the cup was huge! The breakfast potatoes are really good and seasoned perfectly, and the service was pretty fast. There's a reason this place has a line--because it's delicious!  Great place to come for brunch or breakfast with friends or family. Would definitely return... I wanna try that banana nut French toast!  Check in to get the free banana nut muffin!!! It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Really like this place for breakfast. Have enjoyed every breakfast item I have ordered. Service is great. Nice portions. Not a long wait I have been here many times ."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to go for breakfast when I visit Henderson (which is pretty often).  Amazing food and amazing service!  Personally, I'd recommend the country Benny or the chipotle pork Benny, my favorites there so far!  Also make sure to ask for one of their freshly made banana nut muffins. I don't even like bananas and couldn't stop eating these!  Very nice servers that are very attentive. Good family environment as well.  Super cute that they also have a little train that goes in circles around the restaurant up by the ceiling!  A small touch that makes it that much more special."}
{"text":"A fair attempt at servicing large crowds. We took the patio which was comfortable with the mist'ers and the server seemed quick and approachable. Food was good (although my pancakes were dry) and timely but the service style was not good! A jovial guy making lots of random comments to his tables, not fully understood, but the food was thrown at the table by backwaiters with zero interest for the table. No one checked back, no one brought butter or cream for coffee, etc. no one refilled my 2.25 iced coffee or other beverages. After our order was taken we never heard from the server again even tho he walked by our table countless times. No comments, no check on satisfaction! Too many great breakfast joints in town!"}
{"text":"James rocked it! Service was on point and breakfast was bomb. Always order food to go here, but never get a chance to sit down and enjoy it.   I eat the breakfast tostada, for sure a must try!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!   Went this morning with my daughter and we've been going now for about a year (maybe 6-8 total visits) and they all know us and great us nicely.  Nice and warm environment.     Food is amazing!   Period.    Decor - who cares. Never really noticed, but it's about the food, service and cleanliness to me.    Wait time - this can get ugly at times, but hey, a great meal is worth waiting for.     Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you like the gravies that go on a Chicken Fried Steak or a Biscuit then you'll fall in love with it hear!! This is by far one of the tastiest if not the \"BEST\".  It's worth the visit here in Village Center."}
{"text":"Vegas is known for buffets but we found a great Groupon Deal and decided to try this place out. We were seated right away. The menu is extensive but I like the option to choose from a lot. Everything sounded great. I got the Sunrise and My boyfriend got the pancakes, eggs and turkey bacon. We were both pleased with our plates. Huge portions, very tasty and the service was not bad. It wasn't great but it was very busy for a Thursday afternoon. Look forward to trying other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food great service. First time here definitely coming back on our next trip to Vegas. Thank you telly for the great service. Have to try the muffin."}
{"text":"This place has such a variety of food options. Great breakfast spot. The potatoes are amazing and the princes are decent."}
{"text":"Rob the man, what an excellent waiter. He fell all over to keep us happy. Great food too but Rob is the star here. Sorry PK!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm so impressed! The food is great...but more impressed by our most awesome server Raul! :)   Let's start off first by saying that the wait for a table wasn't bad at all for a Sunday morning Brunch. About 15 minutes. We wanted to try something not so Denny's or IHOP....we actually were on our way to The Cracked Egg but ended up here by accident...a pure mistaken identity for the other egg place (???...don't ask I just told him to turn in here...) It gets crowded and kind of cold in that little waiting area just inside the doorway but they do seat you as promptly as possible. LOOK and READ all of the specials they have on the chalkboard at the entrance before you go in! They have a pretty good spread for an egg restaurant lol!   The ambience is a very cozy warm family friendly atmosphere. We sat down and was a little unsure of the menu...as we had no idea it was a menu at first glance...Lots of reading...so bring your reading glasses!...The Awesome Raul took our order...He was kind enough to run back to the front to tell me exactly what the firecracker(somethin...somethin...) was. I don't remember what it's called...but it's pretty much chili cheese breakfast nachos with potatoes on the side and choice of toast or muffin...yummy!   The food came out and was all delicious and well worth the dollar amount...Raul was very attentive to all the patrons he served and what impressed us so much was his genuinity...he shows he cares about every patrons experience and doesn't stress under pressure. He is definitely management material! Hubs and I rave about this restaurant mostly because of the service and not just from Raul but from all the servers there as well! His name is the only one that stuck because we interacted with him most.  So here is the score: Restaurant cleanliness - Four Star  Menu - Four.Five Star (lots of reading little time before ordering lol)  Service - Five Star  Food - Five Star  Parking - Three Star (lot is kinda small)  Total score:...Five Star (yes my math is wrong...but it's soooooo right)   Would I come back again...absolutely! Would I refer to a friend...HYFR! Would I go back to Denny's?...only if I'm not in Las Vegas and craving breakfast."}
{"text":"Unbelievable...we usually frequent this place once a month for the last 8 months and gradually service has been getting poor. Today was the last straw for us...  We are a party of 5...wanted to bring my nephew here because he's never been. We were seated promptly. The restaurant wasn't crowded at all. But we waited. And waited...20 mins and no one has even come by to get our drink orders. It wasn't until one of the waitresses that was tending to a nearby table turned to Waitress #2 and very politely said, \"You know that's your table.\" Waitress #2 peered over to our table continued to pick up after an empty table and turned and walked away. Quite a surprise at the lack of customer service today...enough for us to just get up and leave right now. LITERALLY just walking out...  We will continue to go to EggWorks but we much prefer the service at the 215 & Rainbow location."}
{"text":"Ashley was an amazing server! We had many food allergies and she was so accommodating! The food was so yummy and hit the spot! Service was quick and they checked often if we needed anything. We will for sure be back since finding places to eat with allergies is rough."}
{"text":"This place deserves 29 1/2 stars!!! We couldn't wait for the egg & I to branch out w/ Egg Works!  Staff 5* Service 5* Environment 5* Price 4 1/2* Management 10*  PLEASE OPEN ONE IN NORTH LAS VEGAS!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! The food was good and our server was even better! She was so sweet, I wish I could remember her name because she was really nice. The food was good and we found a really great groupon deal so that's nice too. I would really like to have given this place FIVE stars but the cashier was so incredibly rude, it was almost like we were bothering her to pay for our food! As you can tell I'm not good with names otherwise I would have remembered hers too..."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and they always have a groupon 13 for 20 which is a great deal. I love there omelettes the best my friend got the Italian skillet I didn't like it. There banana muffins are so good!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast spot. Fast and great service. Got the original breakfast burrito and it was full of flavor. Also love the idea of flipping the egg so your server knows you need something!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here and both times the service has been sparse even though they have a lot of people working the floor.   Let me tell y'all about the food though. Based on my personal experiences here, it's average. Today though, with my meal it was just down right trash y'all, honestly truly. I had the Carlsbad sandwich on sourdough with a side of fries. The sandwich is essentially a club ok and I can't even make this up but 3/4 of this sandwich was sad iceberg lettuce. The turkey was barley there. Like there was maybe an ounce of shredded turkey breast on one half of the sandwich. Also the fries were so overly fried that they were nearly burnt through.  Personally I don't see myself or my family coming back. The food we've had is average and not worth the price. But as always make your own opinion, I hope it's better for you then it was for us!"}
{"text":"Donna was our server and she was outstanding! Water was always filled which is a big thing to me and she gave us complementary muffins which were amazing!! Would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"There's so much competition in the breakfast-lunch market in this area, that I had lived in Vegas for two years before trying this one. I think the other breakfast-lunch places have lost my business. I haven't found anything else that even comes close.  Portions are filling, but not ridiculously overdone. If you order fruit as a side, you get actual large slices of a mixed variety of fruits. The banana nut muffins are good as homemade. (I won't say \"better than\", because I make great muffins.)  I've ordered the eggs and pancake combination, and the Eggs Benedict today. Both very good, although surprisingly, I liked the platter better.   Service is both efficient and friendly. The wait staff acts like they enjoy their jobs, and their customers. Nice to get smiles and helpfulness!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast enjoyed delicious meal. Love the banana nut muffins. Andrea was a very attentive server and most pleasant."}
{"text":"Hi, I went here for father's day and I saw roaches on the floor. Two on the patio and one inside. Managed to also take a picture. Please clean this 'dirty dining' up."}
{"text":"I had gotten sat at a small table next to the kitchen. When it comes to breakfast, I really care about how the potatoes are done just as much as the rest of the meal. I did not enjoy the potatoes as it was over seasoned. Considering that was what was covering most of the plate it was disappointing. The food is just ok, nothing spectacular. The servers were kind and attentive, but it's not enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"Do not miss out! this was the best breakfast meal that I had all weekend. I wish I had an egg works where I lived. The potatoes were well seasoned and the eggs were cooked to order. Dont miss out on the banana muffin either its delicious.    The service was great. Our server was brady, he had a great attitude and was attentive. He took the time to check in with us  to see how the meal tasted and to make sure we had everything we needed. The restaurant uses a yellow egg/black egg system that alerts all servers that some sort of attention is needed at the table. This is a very helpful way making the restaurant more efficient and an overall better experience. I will absolutely return and tell everyone I know how eggs-cellent this place is!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is amazing and the staff is always fast and friendly. Martha is an exceptional server as well!"}
{"text":"Donna was awesome and the food matched! We had a great breakfast and she made it even better. What a great spot for some homemade breakfast."}
{"text":"We are regulars and always enjoy the food here, especially the Mexican crepes and waffles. Our server, Charmagne, was great!"}
{"text":"This has become my favorite breakfast place in Vegas.  Above all, I feel the customer service is the best but the food is pretty good too.  I had the egg white, mushroom, artichoke, etc omelet, potatoes and fruit.  My kids ate everything on their plates which is unusual."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite brunch place in Vegas! They have both amazing food and customer service it was so pleasant being in here. Every server passing by was willing to help my boyfriend and I out even if they weren't our designated server. They all work so hard while still being able to keep a smile on there face! Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is so Amazing!!! Everything is Bomb!! This place only deserves 5 stars! I had the breakfast burrito and blueberry pancakes and my gf had a salad and biscuits and gravy and we shared a banana mufffin. Everything is home made and incredible. We will return."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was tasty! I got the classic breakfast which was the perfect amount of food, and the seasoned potatoes were awesome! The staff was friendly and they cleaned the tables well when turned. My husband got the California Egg Crepe which was also good! Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I had never tried this place out and I had lived in Vegas my whole life. On my first visit back (since moving to California) my bf and I decided to eat here after my doctors appointment because we were starving. I ordered the stuffed french toast and he ordered the original breakfast burrito. The works potatoes were delicious! I truly wish this place would open more locations outside of Las Vegas. I liked it that much! Service was great and VERY fast. Ashley was our server and she was very friendly. We will definitely be back when we visit."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!   Ordered the 'stuffed french toast' and the portions were extremely generous... 2 full french toasts slices, a half a plate of eggs, and a half a plate of the MOST AMAZING tater tots...  Pretty much two plates of food since i asked for the french toast to be 'unstuffed'  The potatoes were TO DIE FOR, and I would go back simply just for these potatoes....  It's a lil bit pricey for me, ~$10 per order but the food is AMAZING"}
{"text":"Sayra is an amazing waitress she made sure all our needs were meet and even remade the bacon when it was brought to us to crispy. She helped us save money on orange juice by getting us a pitcher instead buying 2 individual one. Excellent service will be returning!!!!"}
{"text":"We keep going back.   Excellent service by Andrew.  I'm addicted to the Chile Relleno omelet.   I order avocado on the side to make it perfect.   Quick friendly service at this location.  It's a favorite!"}
{"text":"Knowing most Egg Works are typically packed for breakfast hours I called to make a reservation, but was told reservations are for six or more in a party (I highly recommend reservations if applicable).  When we arrived they were full.  All of the indoor seating in the waiting area was full, and we were told there would be a waiting time of about ten minutes.  Because it was cold outside, we stood near the registers trying not to block the walk through too much.  After about five minutes, we were able to get some seating in the waiting area.   When we got seated we were greeted and offered beverages almost immediately.  The service and food was excellent (I've always had really good service at any of the locations I've visited).  I tried something different today; the brioche breakfast sandwich -without the cheese- and hash brown patties in lieu of the signature potatoes.  It was very good.  Everything about the experience was very good with the exception of the lack of adequate space at the entrance of the restaurant.  Not enough seating for those waiting and if there is a line of people waiting to check out at the the register it quickly blocks a main walk through.  If you happen to have been seated near the entrance, you will have people standing right behind you waiting in line to pay (when it's backed up).  If you are at the table next to the hostess, you'll have people directly across from your table in the \"waiting area\" seating.  Luckily, we were not placed at a table near the entrance.  I will definitely go back to an Egg Works.  I don't think this location has outdoor dining seating."}
{"text":"I like to come here around 2 for a late brunch on weekends.. Any other time they are usually busy. But make sure to get here before their last seating at 3. Everything here is pretty good! I love their chicken tortilla soup & banana muffins. I usually either get a bacon avocado omelette which comes with their yummy potatoes or a spinach berry salad with grilled chicken. The portions are good and the service is nice! Nothing TOO special but definitely better than Ihop & Denny's~"}
{"text":"Good, not great. The special potatoes suck.  Just seem to be sysco home fries with paprika. The rest is fairly standard breakfast stuff.  Nothing amazing.  Not worth the line. The banana muffin is pretty good."}
{"text":"Suzzy! Suzzy! Suzzy!  She was the best, I go to Egg Works quite frequently and she has been the best. Super nice and patient, constant smile on her face, whether she was with us or others or just walking from table to table taking care of her tasks.  My new favorite person aside from Justin Timberlake."}
{"text":"We came in here on a busy Saturday morning and were sat right away.  The staff was nice and friendly, but slightly inattentive. My friend ordered an omelette that looked and apparently tasted amazing, except that he ordered a side of sausage and instead of giving him a SIDE, they put in the omelette.  When he told our server, the server just said, \"oh sorry, I thought you wanted it inside the omelette,\" and never brought a side! LOL. I ordered a Works Skillet and was disappointed.  It was all potatoes and barely any bacon or sausage. I ate the eggs and as much of the sausage and bacon as I could find and when I was done, it looked like I had barely made a dent because there was so much of the potatoes.  The coffee was good though and the food was cheap, but I'd venture over the 215 to the Cracked Egg instead!"}
{"text":"Place is AMAZING !! We live in California, so every time we're in town. We make it a point to come here !!! Breakfast is  I love the Country Benny! And their muffins OMG !! They're the best !!! You must check out this place !"}
{"text":"I love egg works and their other resteraunt The egg and I!  My friends and I have been coming here since they opened! The joint is usually packed! Worth the wait! They have EVERYTHING you can dream of on the menu! All things breakfast! I typically get a cup of coffee, and then stare at the menu for 25 minutes trying to decide what to get!   I have a lot of food allergies, they have always been very accommodating! It would be a great idea to have a sampler platter for those of us who are just indecisive!  Over the years I've had many items on their menu, I love the stuffed French toast, the biscuits and gravy with sausage patties, the skillets, and the build your own omlet! Bacon, jack, tomatoes, avocado and spinach yum!!!  My only complaint, can ANYONE in this town do prime rib for breakfast????"}
{"text":"It's always busy here but egg works staff tries  to really take care of you.Ash was my server today , she's super sweet and got my food pretty quick can't complain best breakfast spot before I head to school :)oh they give military discounts just FYI."}
{"text":"Who would have figured that this place would have been so good in a small nondescript strip mall?? You gotta come tot his place...  a. Location - Not bad, but kind of hidden away at the Park 2000 Strip Mall on the Northeast corner of Sunset and Eastern. Not quite visible from the street, but there are some signs.  Plenty of parking.  b.  Ambiance - I was pleasantly surprised by the feeling of the restaurant. I was thinking that it would be small and budget like.  It was rather large, well lit, and the feeling was just right. A bit homey, plenty of room and a feeling like, this is comfy!  c.  The menu - OK, I am generally not too confused and know what I like. However, this place has an amazing menu.  It is like a local newspaper with several pages.  From these amazing egg/bacon/ carb combos, to hawaiian breakfast, to omelets, salads, hamburgers, chili the cincy way.... everything sounded so good.  I opted for an omelette with sourdough toast, and I am saving myself for the hawaiian breakfast and for the chili over spaghetti.  That sounds so cool... You cannot go wrong at this place, the choices are quite amazing.  d.  The service - I would say, this is more than great. They check on you all the time, they are professional, very courteous and very friendly.  I think they have servers that believe in their company, in their product and proud.  It is such a great feeling.    e.  The food - I described the menu, and the food is just as great.  Everything here works well. It just clicks. I have already come back since this lunch on Saturday to try out the meals on Sunday morning which is a busier time at their other location. Guess what, it was only a 15 minute wait.  Denny's Ihop,  WHO?  Never again.   GK says, for a great experience, try the Egg Works."}
{"text":"Chicken or Egg?  That is the proverbial question.  When I am it comes time for breakfast, you will k now that the egg comes first and Egg Works is like the best place for breakfast in Henderson!  Here is the dealio....  a.  Location - Sunridge Heights and Eastern on the West side of Eastern.  Easy to get to and plenty of parking!  b.  The wait - This is the key to any breakfast restaurant and the wait here is quite satisfactory.  I have come here from 7:00 am to 8:30 am and even lunch and the wait on a Sunday or on a popular holiday Sunday is never more than 15 minutes.   c.  The wait control - As much as the wait, with  your anxiety at a higher level, the control by management of the list is also proactive and top notch!  d.  The menu -= Yeah baby...  Whatever you want, whatever your \"diet\" ,  whatever you are feeling, they have it.  A list of key menu items are:  - Egg Substitute - Hash Brown Substitute - Cottage Cheese and Fruit for sure. - Hawaiian breakfast - Cincinnati chili - Thin chili sauce over spaghetti!!! - Pancakes - Omelettes - Traditional eggs - Biscuits and Gravy - Hamburgers - It goes on and on......  e.  I love the menu because there are times when I want an omelette and when I want something decadent like a hamburger or biscuits and gravy and they have it all.   f.  Pickiness - If you have picky kids, or family members, here are there are so many choices that are scrumptious and fun that you cannot go wrong here!  The right wait, the right food,  great service, what more can you ask for?  GK says....check it out."}
{"text":"Good experience. Rob was our waiter. He was genuinely pleasant. I could tell he loves his job. He was very attentive & gave good menu suggestions since this was our 1st visit. After ordering my husband & I were surprised with complimentary banana nut muffins. The muffins arrived warm and literally melted in our mouths. When our food arrived we asked for muffins to go. The food portions were excellent. My husband & I both had leftovers. Overall wonderful experience and we will definitely be back the next time we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Victoria is the best waitress ever !! The hobo scrambler can't say the same for but having such an awesome waitress made up for the wrong choice to order"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices, attentive service.  What more could you all for?  Oh yeah,  great banana nut muffins!"}
{"text":"Let me just say WOW. I ordered the tostada salad. what I got was a salad big enough for the table. I hd no idea how huge this thing was. HUGE! and I'm from west TEXAS! and yes everything is bigger and better there. . but this place is awesome in its own right.   The salad had meat, cheeses, so many things I just thought it was so good. and when I took it to go there was still so much left I couldnt even fit it all int he to go box. yes. that big.   I loved it and almost couldnt stop. The salsa wasnt hot but it was yummy. my bf ordered a skillet which was good but nowhere near as good as what I ordered.  I wanted to order the cobb salad so bad but I already had it in my head that the tostada was what I wanted so till next time!"}
{"text":"This place serves breakfast and lunch only..pretty big portion for the price...service is on par...has outdoor seating too"}
{"text":"Great place and a sister resturant to Egg and I.  I got the Burrito with fruit and it was very good and very filling.  The place is fast so you don't have to wait long for a yummy breakfast!"}
{"text":"Went to Stacks and Yolks, and waited 20 minutes to get drinks. Left and went to Egg Works, and was immediately sat and got our food within 20 minutes. Excellent service and excellent food, definitely will return for the Banana Nut bread!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place numerous times and it has never disappointed.  It has become a must when my family members from out of town come to visit.  The service is a given considering the yellow/black egg.  The food is great!  I have had a number of their breakfast dishes and the Breakfast Tostada is by far the best!  The Chili Omelet is great as well.  Their seasoned potatoes are just plain delicious and they serve alcohol.  Beer for breakfast?  Indeed.  I used to live right down the street but have moved further away.  My wife and I still try to hit this place up at least once a month.  I have gone here after my bachelor party and after running the rock n' roll marathon and both times the food helped to ease my pain."}
{"text":"A good diner atmosphere with large portions and a friendly staff will always get at least 4 stars. There was nothing particular about this place that made it stand out supremely to give it 5. A solid place I would go back to with a wide selection."}
{"text":"I think this is the best place I ever been for breakfast. It was a bit wait but it's worth it. People who work there are so fast, professional and kind. We order two classic Benedict's it came with pork bacon.I don't eat pork but I don't like to throw food so I had to eat it. Btw it was too thick and it's not classic thin bacon. Yikes....Beside that everything was good, hollandaise sauce was best of the best!!! I got free muffin as a yelper which was really good add to my coffee haha.  I have only one tip for this place: please guys add to your menu lox (salmon) Benedict. You have all type egg Benedict's even with turkey but my favorite is only lox."}
{"text":"Hector was amazing - service was on point. The food was incredible - highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast. The service is always great & the food is always so good. Today I tried the chicken, mushroom & spinach skillet. It was good & filling (potatoes are on bottom). Just couldn't finish it. Ate half. I usually order the spinach Benny or Classic with bacon & scrambled eggs.   I love their season potatoes & banana nut muffins. But been getting wheat toast instead for a healthier choice.   Also another thing I noticed is that every time I come here I notice that the manager is always checking on every table and is friendly.   As far as the atmosphere. It was pretty comfortable despite it being very busy. It's always very busy in here.   They also serve lunch & really good bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"What came first? The chicken or the egg? Well it was me that came once I put their delicious chicken n' chorizo hash down my gullet.  Good sized menu and great sized portions with some eclectic menu items made this a very desirable spot to break fast.  The running choo choo train was a nice touch."}
{"text":"I got NY Steak and Eggs for 11 bucks. Not a bad price. The steak was a little small. Came with potatoes and a free banana muffin. My sis got Country fried steak. She didn't like the CFS cause it was all jammed up together and a bit mushy.  The Potatoes that came with the meal were delicious..The seasoning on them were very tasty. The muffin was....well let me just say i finished it in like 3 seconds. Prob the best muffin I ever had.  My sister didn't eat her CFS so they took the charge off the receipt. I was shocked because I told the waitress not to worry about it, but she refused and took the charge off anyway.  So the customer service was 10 out of 10 which made the whole experience even that much better.  You can't go wrong with this place"}
{"text":"MANUELA, Was really nice...great customer service and food was Great. Keep it up Manuela. This was my first visit , and I for sure will come back. It is a great place for family breakfast. Really nice people, clean and cozy. Thank you for your caring Manuela. ;)"}
{"text":"To be far I tried this place twice. Very disappointed as it is across the street from my residence. Totally over priced !!  Slow service ..poor quality. My favorite egg dish is Eggs Benedict....  a total disaster.   I'll drive the 12-15 min. to go back to Blueberry Hill Rest.  They get it right 100% of the time."}
{"text":"Have been going to this location for years and I feel bad for not having written a review in all that time.  The staff, no matter how they've changed over the years, are always cheery and get your orders to you in a fast and timely manner.  I've had many different  things on their menus and they've always prepared it on point. If you order a steak at a certain temperature, it comes to you that way. Any special requests, they always find ways to finagle and accomodate them.  A great place to recommend groups of friends to go catch up with, or your roommates and family."}
{"text":"Ate alone after a morning of hard labor.  It was nice to a have a bar area looking outside or able to watch TV.  Sometimes eating alone is awkward.  Reina was sweet, fast and attentive.  The food was amazing.  Will visit again soon."}
{"text":"We usually love Eggs works, however today was a miserable experience to say the least. We were given a 20 min wait... seated 45 mins later. We sat on the patio and were dive-bombed and swarmed with pigeons for the length of our meal. Secondly, we had a party of six however when the food came out only two people were served. After several minutes we asked on the status of the other meals and the waitress advised us that she could only place 4 orders at a time when the kitchen is busy. The two people who had food were half way done by the time the rest of us got our food ...while waiting surrounded by pigeons. Needless to say we will not be back."}
{"text":"I arrived around 10AM so I understand the place is busy, but not one server came to assist with seating. I was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar after about 10 minutes. I agreed. Waited a good 15 minutes after about 3 \"be right with you\"... no water nothing. I order coffee and it was horrible and super hot. I order eggs benedict, salty salty salty and for no reason came in a to go bag. Bill comes, way overpriced. Much better choices than this establishment. I suggest to avoid."}
{"text":"Had the chipotle pork Benny, insanely delicious. We went with a huge group and got sat quickly. Amazing service and Everyone enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"We come to Egg Works frequently even though it's a decent drive from our house.  The restaurant is large, so there is usually not a horrible wait.  But, like any popular breakfast place, the waits can get long on weekends during high traffic times.  So, plan accordingly.  When the weather is nice, they have a patio with a few tables.  I usually get the breakfast burrito, which is very large and cooked on the flat top to give it a nice finish.  My wife gets the chicken enchilada or mashed potato omelet.  She always gets a half size, which is a great amount for her.  The potatoes are squared, fried, then covered in a fantastic seasoning, basically a seasoning salt, but it doesn't appear as salty to me.    The french toast stuffed with eggs, cheese, and your choice of meat is another dish we frequently order.  The scrambles are very good as well.  Clearly, we have eaten here a lot.  Once, I could bring myself to order a burger, and it was fantastic.  Large, juicy, and not overly cooked.  But, 99 times out of 100, I'm ordering breakfast at Egg Works."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place around! We eat here at least once to twice a month. They have great customer service and the food comes out fast which is good when you have a hungry one year old! Thanks for being awesome guys! :)"}
{"text":"I Love Love Love This Place!!!  The chicken pesto scramble is the BEST EVA!  OMG!!  I have to go here every single time I come to Vegas!! The people are so nice.  The food is so great.  Its the best :)"}
{"text":"Yummy place to eat!! Our server Amy L. did a wonderful job!! She was fast and very attentive!! So sweet!! She made our breakfast experience pleasant! Our favorite spot for breakfast from now on."}
{"text":"Great food, generous portions, excellent service at a good price. Try to get there early in the morning since it gets pretty crowded for breakfast on Sundays."}
{"text":"Chistopher was an amazing server and the food here was amazing!  Thank you for an amazing experience."}
{"text":"Asking for a review when I was craving something I couldn't find on the menu is a tricky task lol I didn't choose coming here for breakfast  I came along with my mom  But I would still come here, besides the fact.  This place has a good country home feel.  The first thing I noticed as I walked through the doors was the country music coming from the speakers, that's the way to my heart.  As soon as I sat down, our server, Nic came to greet us happily.  And brought my banana nut muffin upon check in, super quick. Along with my coffee.  The perfect pair.  I ordered the country Benny, I was feeling for something with smoked salmon, but couldn't find anything on the menu with it. So I went the completely unhealthy route of country gravy covered everything.  I'm not opposed to this choice.  It was great!"}
{"text":"Late brunch the past Sunday and we brought a friend whose never experienced the egg wonders of Las Vegas's breakfasts.  (He's usually fast asleep after the graveyard shift!)  He chose the Beef Eater \"Grilled Parmesan sourdough, Swiss cheese, caramelized onions, and grilled roast beef and a side of horseradish sauce.\"  I'm not sure if they are still using horseradish sauce, but my friend thought it was hollandaise sauce!  I tried a bit and found it 'interesting.'  The sandwich was decent as he finished it all, and the Works potatoes was a generous portion because he had a lot leftover.  The Husband was craving the Country Fried Steak \"A hand battered chicken fried steak, topped with Grandma's country gravy and served with two eggs, Works potatoes and a choice of toast or banana nut muffin.\"  He has his two eggs over easy with sourdough bread.  The country gravy was definitely creamy, but needed a bit more zip.  I wanted a side of corn beef hash, and the waitress said they could definitely do that.  She asked if I wanted the homemade version or the canned, which I had never been asked before.  Apparently they just started doing the homemade version, but most people prefer the canned one instead.  Feeling the need to experiment, I went with the homemade version, knowing ahead that it was going to be more stringy-like.  And she also asked if I wanted it more well-done, which I took as \"crispier.\"  They also serve it as a small or large side order.  The homemade version is definitely a bit more stringier and something I've had quite often since most Filipinos eat their corned beef like that.  However, it definitely needed a bit more flavor - some heat and pepper took care of that!  Overall, our breakfast experience this time was okay.  Our friend wasn't as impressed, and just found it to be average.  We weren't wowed the same way as the first time.  (Pics posted!)"}
{"text":"Ive been to many a different egg works.  this review is for this specific location -every other would probably get 5 stars.  the service was prompt as per usual in all the locations.  crowded on the weekend as is also usual (we sat at the bar).  parking here is a little trickier. but we were lucky and got a spot out front. i wanted 2 eggs over medium, toast, and potatoes, bc their taters are just so darn good.  i also wanted one chocolate chip pancake.  when i placed my order with our waitress she told me to get some combo that is the same thing but comes with a meat and 2 pancakes. that it would end up being cheaper. i dont really eat breakfast meat but my brother in law said he would eat it. so i got it. when my food came, my eggs werent cooked right. and, AND, there were no taters with my meal. which is pretty much the best part of their breakfast.  i didnt complain bc i was hungry and didnt want to wait, so i ate some of it but really just ate the pancakes.  the pancakes were good. overall i ended up spending $15 for 2 pancakes. i most likely should have complained. i would go back to this location just bc it is the most convenient. but i'll watch out for the waitress, and send my food back if it isnt done right. and until i go back they are keeping the 2 stars. oh, and the sauce that comes with the breakfast stromboli, really just tastes like tomato paste."}
{"text":"Moved back here 2 days ago from Cali, and we don't have any food in the house yet. We decided to eat at Egg Works 2 days in a row :)  We got Nicole both times, and she is awesome!   The first day, we ordered the steak skillet (special of the day), the chicken and spinach skillet, and the mouse pancake for our little one. The food was excellent, and came out very quickly. Nicole let us take our time as we looked over the huge menu, and even let our baby keep taking straws from her apron pocket. She also explained about their homemade salsas, homemade muffins, and told us where to find coupons to dine there again!   The second day, we came back and were again seated in Nicole's section. She remembered us from the day before. She again gave us plenty of time to look over the menu and decide, and gave the baby straws again. She loves them! This time we ordered biscuits and gravy, and the veggie works benny. Yum! Also, since we just moved back, Nicole asked if we knew about some local changes since we left, such a new grocery stores.   We went to pay, and discovered they offer a 30% military discount!  Score!!!  We will definately be back (maybe tomorrow?) And will request Nicole's section!"}
{"text":"10.15.10  I love breakfast.  Greasy potatoes, cheese, eggs over easy, and giant cup of coffee.  This place does it great."}
{"text":"Pros: Excellent Eggs Benedict. Great ambiance and average prices. Excellent customer service.  Cons: Almost three bucks for coffee and it tastes as though it's very low quality coffee made with unfiltered water."}
{"text":"This location is one of the best! Food didn't take too long. Our waitress took well care of us and checked on us just enough times at the end of my BF omelette found onions which he hates he showed our waitress and she apologized and offered a new one he said no because he stated he could even taste them till he saw them, shortly after the manager came over apologized again gave us a discount and a loaf of carrot cake yummy we weren't even complaining and they still took matter into making our experience great!"}
{"text":"Can I just say excellent?!!  I wish they were open longer hours. They have the best tuna melt sandwich I have been able to find in the Las Vegas or Henderson area.  They have many other items including their breakfast items that sound wonderful I just can't break away from the tuna melt!  I have only visited the one on Sunset and Eastern but every time I have been there excellent food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Great food, even better service.  Ask for Amber."}
{"text":"You don't get this creative with an omelette in Dallas. Average restaurant, about as thrilling decor as Denny's. The food however...wow!  I had the chicken omelette with guacamole and Muenster cheese. My mother in law had a delicious rice/egg bowl, brother in law had the mashed potato omelette, husband had the Mexican omelette, brother had chilli and cheese omlette...can't remember what else our party of 8 had, lol. Our server saw that we we're tourists and brought free banana but muffins for us to try. We were so excited because the service alone was impressive. We kept taking bites out of each others food because it was so much food, with so much variety, and so many different flavors. It was so good! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I went to this location on Sunday morning. It was not busy and plenty of employees working. It took 10 minutes for a server to come to our table once we were seated!  Food here is terrible. I ordered a bacon & cheese omelette with their home made banana nut muffin. Choice of DEEP FRIED potatoes of hash brown patties (2) or their DEEP Fried \"Works\" potatoes. Both are frozen. I chose the hash brown potato.  The muffin came first, it was small and looked to be a cupcake, not a muffin. The muffin was dark brown and black....it was burned and dry. I asked for another muffin that was not burned. The second muffin was the same way. I looked around at other tables and noticed all the people had toast, not the muffin.   The thin omelette arrived. It was burned and the bacon was small pieces of crumble which you could not taste. Sent it back to be made again. Received the same thing back, but it was not burned. The hash brown patty was like McDonalds but it was dense and not good. Not at all like McDonalds.  I gave this one star due to the manager coming over to our table to apologize and telling us she was taking care of the check.  p.s. The manager wanted us to try the Works potatoes.  They were small deep        fried potato pieces with Paprika dusted on them. They were served        cold and they tasted old, like they had been sitting around for a long time."}
{"text":"I was excited about going to Eggworks because I have seen good reviews and I have seen the long lines waiting to get in.  Unfortunately, my meal was rather underwhelming.    I ordered flavored coffee and they gave me regular coffee that tasted like burnt rubber, melted into a molasses like consistency.  They also forgot to give me the side dish that I ordered.  The poached eggs and toast were serviceable but nothing out of this world. Biting into the chicken fried steak was like chewing on beef jerky that has been smothered by plain Crisco.  The best thing about the meal were the little pre-packaged packets of jam.    The decor is a half hearted attempt at country kitsch.  The place is mostly decorated with a massive throng of humanity.  I find it perplexing why the place is so popular.  Go to the Coffee Cup in Boulder City to find what Eggworks strives to be."}
{"text":"customer service was very friendly and many egg choices if you love eggs. They even have turkey bacon and sausage. The did my poached eggs just right!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast in Summerlin.   Maryann was great!!   So many things on the menu - hard to choose. Definitely try the Banana Nut Muffins."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. Raw bacon and under cooked eggs. Best thing here was the toast"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast food. The banana nut muffin was amazing. Make sure you check yelp and get your free one or just get it in general. Worth it. Great service and nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Crowded but no wait. Service was efficient and the food was very good. Many interesting breakfast items. I can see why this place is so crowded all the time. I will have to revisit many times to try all their different menu items."}
{"text":"*****FIVE STARS*****!!  Yay!! Egg Works!! You deserves my five stars!!  & esp. to Waitress Donna, we had outstanding service, during our visit: 9/23/2015 This is my first time at this location & 2nd visit to Egg works.  This is my \"must go\" to place, when I vacation here in Vegas.  *I also recommend this place to a friend who was visiting & she thanked me for the recommendation.   We stopped by after 11am on a Wednesday & the place filled up fast when we left.  There were many people waiting for a table. This comes to show how popular & good this place is.   I love how they have cute signs on the table & on the shirts, all egg-related.  This place is cute!!  &  for all those missing Hawaii! They have: loco moco, Portuguese sausage, spam, & Aloha Shoyu!!   I like to mentioned why Donna is so great!!  My order is a little complicated but she managed to get the request in & asked the cook if it was possible.  My order: the country ham breakfast My request: ham well done, eggs:  scrambled & over-easy starch: half rice & half potato & YES!! exactly as requested.   My other half got the omelette breakfast & he enjoyed it.  We both enjoyed our breakfast & our experience @ Egg Work.  We had an EGG-ceptional time!!   Try the potato & of course the banana nut muffin.  These are so yummy!!  I really love how the potatoes are cut up & seasoned so well.  & the muffin is so moist!!  ( check in on Yelp for a free muffin) Thanks Yelp & Egg Work for this offer!!   See you on my next Vegas Vacation Egg Works!!  I hope to have Donna as our waitress again!!"}
{"text":"Awesom job, Ashley! Loved the food and the waitress was terrific. The mashed potato omelette was yummy licious!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Ever since we stopped in for brunch I've been craving their delicious biscuits and gravy and banana bread French toast! I don't know why it took us so long to get here but it won't take nearly as long to get us back! We only tried their breakfast items but their lunch menu looked pretty awesome too! The food came out fast and hot and we couldn't stop stuffing our faces to answer the waitress when she came by to refill our glasses and check on us. Definitely a must go to in Vegas!"}
{"text":"candice is the best.......we got food super quick......very very pleasant person........if you don't send her to disney.......your a fool....lol"}
{"text":"I love this place! I probably come here way too much being staff knows me but why not go where you feel comfortable. The staff are always pleasant service is great and for breakfast/ lunch price is so reasonable. It's also great the serve liquor helllllooooo mimosas!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to try it. What a great decision.  My wife had the best corned beef hash ever. I had the Works Scramble which was soooo good. Everything I would put in eggs. The potatoes are a must and so is the banana nut muffin. Ashley was awesome and we will be requesting her again. Walk, crawl, drive, or skate board but get here for breakfast."}
{"text":"That banana nut muffin and coffee was already enough to make me want to come back and try more menu items! Fast service; however, I would plan ahead or choose to come on the weekday since it gets really busy Saturday-Sunday."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast food (not in love with their lunch foods). My favorite menu item is the Spinach Benny without the Canadian bacon.  Their Poached eggs are done just right. HUGE portions and, if you're not a big eater, most things on the menu can be obtained as HALF orders. EggWorks' waitstaff are really on the ball - have never been disappointed by the service. If you prefer sweet dishes you won't be disappointed either.  For those of us who live in Anthem this is definitely the place for breakfast! I've been less impressed with their lunch menu. That said,  I always try to order the type of food a restaurant is known for - so, for example,  if I'm going to a steak house I don't order fish. In this case as its a breakfast place I don't order lunch foods."}
{"text":"Great service, thanks to Thay!!  Very attentive, never had to ask for refills, which is a pet peeve of mine."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. Worst service of all the Egg Works in the valley.  Server was unfamiliar with the menu, and my order was incorrect; manager did not seem to care.  She just told me that our server was new. No kidding.... No concessions were offered, other than a muffin that I did not want.  THREE people tried to clear my plate WHILE I WAS STILL EATING. Just shocked that a new restaurant in an established chain could have such poor service."}
{"text":"*DONNA DONNA DONNA- our server who was lovely! *  I ordered the prime rib Benedict and I found it to be a 7 out of 10. Conceptually the components were all delicious. The bread was lightly toasted, the hollandaise sauce was as it should be rich with a mild zest. The meat was savory but I found all of these ingredients together kind of washed each other out. Oh and my egg was poached perfectly. Next time I want to try their country Benedict.   My boyfriend had the beef style club burger and I can't speak to how it tastes but I was told it was also savory and nicely cooked.   Now on to our service.... Donna was our server and even though this place was packed she checked on us regularly. She was lovely, friendly and genuinely interested in making our first visit here a good one. Can't wait to come back again and try another of their breakfast masterpieces."}
{"text":"We came here to eat on a Saturday morning during their lunch rush. Me, being the asian that I am, ordered rice with my eggs Benedict. Food took a little longer than usual( which is expected for a place like this and for a Saturday morning) which was totally fine with me. Our food came out BUT... NOT. THE.RICE... :(. Which was totally fine with me to be honest. But then the manager came out and apologized for the delay and even gave us a discount on our bill!! How awesome is that. And then they gave us one of their big a$$ brownies!! 5 stars for the food (which was hella good btw) and 5 stars for the awesome service. Come here and eat. The wait is well worth it"}
{"text":"They're always so friendly, I've only had 1 issue in the 3 years I've been coming here. I really wished Lino was still here, he has an adorable laugh."}
{"text":"Came here on day off from cooking to enjoy a late brunch with my wife. Ashley our server was awesome.  Only reason not five stars, wife's eggs were over easy not over medium as she requested.  Will be back because great service is always hard to come by in this town!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and our server, Rob, was very helpful. Suggesting the half size omelette for my wife. The coffee is fresh always . Our new breakfast place"}
{"text":"Good food dog friendly padio friendly staff good place to eat. Recommend to go early to beat the rush."}
{"text":"Service is always good when I come here, I love their omelets, the service today was great I was waited on by Manuela, who was very prompt and courteous with my order, I highly recommend this place for breakfast either by yourself or with the family they are sure to please."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We bought a groupon to try it out. So worth it.   Items bought: Loco moco with country gravy Traditional benny  Corned beef and scrambled eggs Kids scramble eggs and fruit With 2 banana nut muffins  All delicious!! Server was so nice and very efficient!"}
{"text":"I do love me some Egg Works. My hands down favorite is the Santa Cruz burrito - the sauce is outstanding! And you cannot beat their breakfast potatoes. One of the best breakfast places in town."}
{"text":"I had the bacon maple stuffed French toast and the scramble. Both were very good the server was wonderful and nice. The orange juice was oxidized but that was fixed replacing it with coffee"}
{"text":"Not often when a 4 star rating brings down a restaurant's average.  That says a lot about Egg Works.  As Emily R. noted, the tables are comfortably spaced.  There is sufficient parking in the strip mall lot.  The varieties of eggs benedict are interesting but might have too many simultaneous flavors.  The basic eggs are nicely done and served along side potatoes or pancakes, depending on the dish ordered.  Waffles, interestingly, are ala carte and don't have a combination offering on the menu.  Pricing is average: not dirt cheap but not a wallet buster either.  Recommended for a nice, casual, relaxing breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Excellent service today by Blade. It was our first time in, and we were very pleased. Originally we were seated by a very loud guest and asked to move. We relocated and ordered the Veggie Breakfast Skillet and the Sunrise Breakfast. The portion size was plenty for both of us. The Habla Diablo seasoning reminded us of Bojangles seasoning(Fellow Southerners will understand) . We will definitely be back! PS. The Banana Nut Muffins are so fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to get breakfast in Vegas. Went here a bunch of times and loved everything. Everyone loved everything, and I was here in groups. I don't know that there's anything bad on the menu. You could order blindfolded and whatever you get will be good. If this existed in our area, we'd practically live here.   The only downside is it's not on the Strip, so if your reasons for being in Vegas put you on the Strip all the time, you have to go out of your way and maybe you don't have time for that. We happened to be visiting friends who live nearby and that's how we knew about it. If you're not renting a car, this is out of the way of anything you might be doing on the Strip that you could otherwise walk to.   That being said, it's delicious and inviting and groups hold their meetings here so everyone will be happy and satisfied.   So go!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I always have a great experience here! We always sit at the bar. Service is fast and friendly. This is a great go to spot for traditional breakfast food. The waitresses are fun and inviting. They are all willing to give recommendations. I'd recommend it. Coffee is good too"}
{"text":"We were looking for a local type brunch spot - NOT a Vegas buffet. Egg Works was well recommended here so we found our way. Definitely locals eating here. My husband had the Santa Cruz burrito which was yummy. I had the French toast which came with Apple compote. Deanna, our server was happy to get me more compote which made my light and fluffy French toast perfect. Service was great. There were many waiting when we got here and we still had a table within 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Awesome service and food !! PK is the best server hands down !!! fast , friendly , delicious place!! One of my favorite breakfast spots ! Love the banana nut muffin!! great omelettes too!!"}
{"text":"The Spinach Benny was awesome and the Bloody Mary was the best I've ever had. The homemade banana nut muffin was delicious. Our waitress, Randi, was great! We'll definitely be back for breakfast. Next time though I will try the hash browns instead of the Works potatoes."}
{"text":"Veronica was the bomb dot com!! We came here two Sundays in a row and was able to grab sit in the same table both times. Veronica was friendly and very helpful."}
{"text":"Had high ratings, so was curious. Definitely deserves its 4 1/2 stars. I ordered the breakfast special and the lunch special."}
{"text":"I had read the reviews online and wanted to try it.  The food was pretty decent the portions were large.. We took the muffin with us when we left and ate it for lunch on our flight back to TO.  Omelettes were tasty and my husband's home fries were good.  I had fruit on the side in place of the home fries and it was a decent sized portion.  My husband liked omelette house more so we'd probably not go back.  However, I would recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Food and service were fabulous as usual!  Donna was attentive and friendly.  We enjoyed our brunch tremendously."}
{"text":"Had a breakfast before before taking off for the Grand Canyon.  Good hearty breakfast.  Potatoes are a little too salty, but all the other food is great.  We came before on a weekend and it was totally crowded.  Go on a weekday!"}
{"text":"Donna was great!  She was super friendly and accommodated our large party of 9. She met all of our nit picky special request with a smile. Make sure to get the banana nut muffin. That was keeps us coming back"}
{"text":"Good breakfast, muffins are good  Plaines fly over your head landing   No problem with coffee refill"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their veggie Benny is amazing. I refuse to get a Benny anywhere else since there is no comparison. Donna , our server was awesome and we will surely be back next weekend...maybe tomorrow."}
{"text":"After an early flight into Vegas this morning we wanted to start the day w a good breakfast. We chose eggs works because of the location and reviews. Great choice! The menu offers many options from standard breakfast dishes to more adventurous choices. Portions are hearty! Neither of us could finish our dish. The service is also wonderful. You can tell they have it down to a science. Loved the banana nut muffin! Coffee was not too strong as is often the case at breakfast joints. Prices were more than fair. Worth the little drive away from the strip to have a wonderful breakfast experience!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times but haven't reviewed it. The food is decent and the service is good. There is always a wait so we know it is popular. It is not the best breakfast in Vegas but it comes very close. The service is very good. I love restaurants that have the things you can flip if you need service. I know it really helps the servers. We will come back, my wife loves the potatoes they serve and as they say \"happy wife, happy life.\" :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast I had chili omelet very fast service all  the time. Staff always friendly and they give you enough food for two people so go hungry."}
{"text":"Delicious Breakfast. I got the homemade corn beef hash with eggs and potatoes.  Delicious."}
{"text":"We love this place for our family Sunday breakfast. I wish they had chicken and waffles !! Great food great service."}
{"text":"If you grab a seat at the counter Austin is the AWSOME ! If your at a table Kris is King! Heather is an Amazing manager and runs a tight ship so you know when you get your \"classic breakfast\" with turkey bacon on the side it's hot and cooked just the way you want it! Bonus the coffee is always hot and fresh and the service is super fast!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is nice. I like the murals inside the place, as well as their notification system. Flip over a a little dangling egg, from black to yellow, and someone will help you immediately. It works!! The staff is really nice and friendly as well.   This time my friend and I had the bacon and avacado omelette. So good. We both agreed. It's popular for a reason.   The first time I came to a different Egg Works. I had a skillet. It was okay. Not bad, just alright."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place to eat. I haven't found anything I don't like. I drive all the way from Nellis Air Force Base for this food. Awesome food awesome staff and the Train the goes around the ceiling the kids just love."}
{"text":"Love having breakfast at Egg works, love the food and the service. The three pigs omelet is fantastic. Every Time we go we always ask for PK. He is the best server they have. He's very friendly and never forgets about making sure you have everything you need. Would recommend everyone to go!"}
{"text":"Donna was excellent. She had our order in and out in a flash.   Ask for Donna to be your server and you won't regret it!   She's got the old school customer service skills we don't see anymore. Thank you Donna!  Well be back during or next trip."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast. Terrific food and excellent service. Our waitress, Donna, was great! The banana nut muffins are so good."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for breakfast. So much on the menu, it's hard to decide. Service was excellent and our meals were delicious. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh, service is great! And the wait isn't too long!!"}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp after a disastrous visit to the Crown & Anchor. This is everything a great breakfast place should be. Despite it being a \"mob scene\" on a Sunday morning we were seated and served pretty quickly and the breakfast was delicious. GO THERE FOR BREAKFAST."}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was great! It does seem to get pretty full, so expect to wait a while before being seated. The restaurant itself is nice. Good casual ambiance and there's a cool little train that travels around the restaurant near the ceiling. The food is delicious and comes in gigantic portions so come with an empty to stomach to eat everything! Our server was good, but I got the vibe she didn't like it when I turned the little egg signaling that we needed attention. But other than it's a great place to eat breakfast, brunch or lunch!"}
{"text":"breakfast is the most important meal of the day why not make it a great one, yes of course what you are going to eat here its not going to be the healthiest but it is delicious. I am from LA and this is one of the reasons i would come to vegas that omelette with feta to die for and blueberry pancakes with cashews wow. if you head to vegas follow the locals and this is one of those places,"}
{"text":"Ky is one of the best servers my family and I have ever had! She was very great to let us know about special offers for the banana nut muffin over Yelp. She made my mom fresh decaf (which never happens anywhere we go). Our typical egg works is the one off 215 and flamingo in which they are also great but this superseded our standards by far. We will be coming here more often! Thank you for being great to us Ky!"}
{"text":"Their potatoes are amazing. Other than that food is good, but it gets really crowded. I am sure I will go back but will continue to look for other breakfast places."}
{"text":"My office is about a mile away, and this is my favorite place to go for lunch.   EVERYTHING I have tried on the menu is fantastic.... so much so that it is sometimes hard to try something new.  But when I do try something new, it always impresses me.   Hard to go wrong here, and there a extensive variety on the menu!"}
{"text":"Country eggs Benny!!! Where have you been all my life??? I don't know why I haven't thought of this before..."}
{"text":"The girl working in front this morning needs to start waking up. I noticed she was busy writing something on paper after helping us. I went back to her shortly to ask the price of the coffee mug special  (bogo). She was still too busy to make eye contact she began to say what she thought the price was and then said to me \"isn't there a flyer that's posted out there?\" I said yes but no price. Again she went back to \"I think but continued with umm $7.00...it's either it is or it isn't.  Aside from that one negative everyone else is really personable helpful and friendly.  Lots of good food choices and quality.  I used to come here for our Union meetings too bad they won't accommodate our party at the sectioned area any longer."}
{"text":"As always, Egg Works rocks it out.  Great food, friendly staff, quality every step of the way. Our server, Ashley was attentive, knowledgeable and very friendly. The Island Favorite is always my go-to choice for a taste of the islands. Special orders are always OK!"}
{"text":"Apologies for not posting a pic of our meal. Meal was scarfed down before i remembered to take a pic. Wife had the biscuits & gravy, scrambled eggs and diced potatoes. I had a waffle with sliced bananas. The food was quick to the table. Six pack abs will have to wait another day!  1st time here. Parking lot was full and we got seated right away. John our server was quick, attentive, personable and came back several times to check on us. The food was pretty good and the menu was extensive. We have dined at the location by Summerlin library and everything is consistent in what Egg Works offers. Now i just have to deal with the traffic on South Rainbow coming at me at 60+ mph on a rainy day.  Watch out!"}
{"text":"Olivia was an awesome server I will definitely be back. The breakfast was great and the banana nut muffins are the best."}
{"text":"I may not be so much of a morning person but I love breakfast! Egg Works definitely works for me. I enjoyed the country kind of vibe in this place. It was 12:30 in the afternoon and we were greeted with \"Good morning\" and a newspaper as a menu. I thought that was adorable!!! I look forward to returning. The food tastes home cooked kind of delicious and the portions for sure will satisfy your tummy."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to check out Egg Works since moving to Vegas six weeks ago. Finally stopped by this morning. I was seated immediately and was eagerly given assistance by my waitress. I am disabled and needed a little assistance in transferring from scooter to chair. I ordered coffee, veggie omelette with a side bacon. Coffee was served hot and fresh with a pot of coffee left at the table. The omelette was just okay but the bacon was tasteless and had a stiff, rubbery texture. Oh well. I'm sure it's just one of those things that doesn't happen often. I will come again just to see if the breakfast served me next time is any better. My bill came to $15.00. My waitress' name was Lisa, if memory serves me. Very likable, courteous and competent."}
{"text":"Came around 8am. Our waitress was Ashley. After one of the other folks finished taking our drink orders, Ashley returned to take our food order. She was polite and very attentive. After she left in just a few minutes she returned slightly flustered and very honestly told us she had accidentally thrown our ticket away. After retaking our order she left and returned with two muffins. My wife asked why the muffin as she was not to get one. She smiled and reminded us it was for her gaffe regarding our ticket. She left and we chuckled about her being so concerned for forgetting knowing we'd probably forget where we parked our car until we left. Anyway breakfast was awesome and actually the order wasn't any longer to our table than normal. No thanks to Ashley. She also comped our drinks which she didn't need to do but again I think for the error. Its nice she had both the courage and obvious pride in her work to simply be honest. Taking full responsibility for anything today especially in a restaurant is rare. We'll return again for sure no doubt because of food but mostly because of service! Well done Ashley! Now pack your bags and get on that plane...you're going to Disney!!"}
{"text":"First time here and we waited for about 10 minutes. It was crowded on a Sunday morning at 9:30 but was happy to be seated so fast. Our waitress was Maryanne and she was so nice and helpful. We each got a free banana muffin since it was our first time! So delish. I ordered the maple bacon French toast but when it came the stuffed part tasted like blue cheese for some weird reason. They were immediately happy to take it back and offer me a new dish which was awesome. I tried my moms corned beef hash-so good and very flavorful. My husband got the Ensenada burrito and that was smothered in a verde sauce that was great too! My second entree came out and it was the strawberry cream cheese stuffed French toast. It was smothered in a strawberry jam sauce and very filling -sugar high! The only thing I wish they would do is rename the fence toast since the \"stuffing\" wasn't actually stuffed in the bread, just sat on top like butter or a sauce. So that was a little deceiving but it still tasted amazing. Our waitress was the best-very friendly and an amazing host for our first time at this place!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend come here every so often in the mornings usually before work. The last time we had come in, my boyfriends order was messed up and we had to wait about 20 minutes for his order to be corrected. The next time we had went in his order was messed up again, and we had to wait another few minutes for it to be corrected. We understand mistakes happen and that's totally understandable, however, twice in a row is not okay. We had consulted the manager, Sunshine about it. She was super sweet and had awesome customer service. She was super apologetic and compensated my boyfriends meal for both messups. Other than the mistakes, the servers have great customer service and the manager is awesome for making sure that her customers are taken care of. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is EGGsellent!  So i decided to have breakfast here with a friend of mine on the rainbow location. Location is great located near the 215 kinda far from me but a perfect meeting point for people that live on opposite sides of town.  The place looks great everything is clean that's what i normally look for before i enter an establishment. Place smells great, smells like breakfast, a great aroma.  The place is a little bit loud but, you are still able to hold a conversation with your party without screaming your lungs out.  I normally have the eggs benedict but decided to try something different. the Loco Moco. To be honest i was a bit disappointed. For the price i paid for the Local breakfast plate which included spam and eggs the serving was small. The plate cost me around $9+ and i was seriously disappointed! Well at least i know now not to order that plate, I hope someone from that restaurant reads this and makes changes to their Hawaiian plates.   If someone from hawaii ordered that dish they will be starving after eat it.  Overall the service was great., The staff knew when our table needed attention, because they have those EGG markers , which indicate if we needed something. They were on top of that.  I still give this place a 4 star because aside from their terrible hawaiian local plate dish their other dish the eggs benedict was the bomb! and their racheros potato is really good too.  This is by far one of my favorite breakfast places and i still highly recommend this place if you are craving a good breakfast!   Just remember if you are going to order the hawaiian plates it will be small!"}
{"text":"Man, those banana nut muffins!!! They're hot,  delicious, and big! I ordered the bacon avocado omelet, and it had a lot of avocado &  Kudos to my server, Twila for suggesting a half size omelet.  It was exactly the right size. Still a HUGE omelet!!! This place is very attentive.  You can flip the little smily face on your table to a sad face if you need something!  They pay attention to that and come running if they see that you've 'flipped'!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots and I just loved Donna she was amazing!!"}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 80/100***  I have bookmarked this place for quite some time now, but being that I'm not a big breakfast person it has taken me a while to cross it off. Last Saturday was the day we finally decided to check it out. I was still apprehensive thinking that we most likely would have a long wait as this place appeals to locals and tourists alike. Surprisingly though, at around 11:30 there was no wait at all, probably because the morning rush had passed. Though the place was packed it didn't feel over crowded, the restaurant has a nice lay out. We were given a corner booth that was just perfectly sized and was kinda like your own private area.  Their menu is extensive and is creatively in a form of a newspaper. So cute! lol. I was glad I had my mind set on what to get as I perused the menu online ahead of time, or else I probably would've spent a good minute deciding as my husband did.   I got the Spinach benny ($10.55), coffee ($2.75), hubby opted for Corned beef hash ($11.25), hot chocolate ($2.75), kids each got a kids meal: Mickey mouse pancake with added blueberries and comes with a strip of bacon and a drink ($6.25) and Buckaroo which is toast, egg, bacon and a drink ($4.50) All meals except for the Mickey mouse pancake came with a side of their famous Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes which judging by the name I thought was gonna be painfully spicy but thankfully wasn't, they were actually quite delicious! The food was very filling and satisfying, everyone was happy with their respective orders. Although for me, the hollandaise sauce on the benny was a tad rich and thick. I could only eat one. I can't wait to come back and try their omelets though.  Service was very commendable, Sandra was attentive but not overbearing. She brought everything we needed before we could even ask for it. We only had to turn our sign once and that was to ask for a to go box when we were ready to leave. Prices are reasonable for portions you get and comparable to most breakfast joints. All in all this place has what it takes for continued success and worthy of all the positive reviews it's garnered.   Don't forget to check in with Yelp to claim your free Banana nut muffin you can take home for dessert ;)"}
{"text":"It was our first time at this particular location and probably our last. This one is so much smaller than the Rainbow location so the wait for a party of 5 was significantly longer.   Service was so much slower but the food was consistent with the other Egg works so that part was good. Didn't appreciate having to flag down someone though every time we needed something.   Being that it's a new year hubby decided to try something new as opposed to sticking with faves, lol not the wisest idea as the Cincy Chili Loco Moco he opted on was probably the worst tasting item in the menu. Looked like dog food and most likely tasted just as bad. Lol definitely stick with tried and tested faves!"}
{"text":"Second time and it was awesome! James was me and my pop's sever this time. He was great I recommend you sit with him hell treat you well. Was going to try something else but I went with the Sunrise Mountain again which was just as good as the latest time! See you soon Egg Works!"}
{"text":"I love eggs no matter how it's made. It could be scrambled, boiled, poached, or pan fried. I love them all. My favorite is over easy, if you're wondering. When I saw this place on Yelp, I knew I had to try it.  This place wasn't too hard to find on S Eastern Ave. It was on our way to The Hoover Dam. Once we got there, the workers were really nice. The restaurant was about half full so we got seated quickly. Our server brought us the menus and asked if it was our first time. We told her that it was and she promptly got us two banana nut muffins. The bread was warm and moist. I just slathered it with butter. It was yummy goodness.  It took a while to browse over the menu as it was quite extensive. I decided to stick with my tried and true, the Traditional Benny. Two grilled English muffins topped with Canadian bacon, with two poached eggs smothered in hollandaise sauce. It came with a side of Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. How could you go wrong with this? Of course you can't. It tasted just as good as it sounds. The entree was huge. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the hollandaise sauce didn't separate. The potatoes were so so. I like my potatoes crispy and this wasn't. I would have preferred crispy hash browns instead.  The hubby had some kind of turkey skillet breakfast. Turkey is not listed on the menu for the skillets. If you ask for it, they can make it. He really enjoyed it. I never got a chance to taste it. I was busy working on my own plate. I couldn't finish, so he ate my other benny muffin."}
{"text":"When I was an omnivore, I frequented here because there weren't many breakfast places off the strip (in the Flamingo/215 area) and it was good enough, plus they serve alcohol.  I had family in town this weekend for Thanksgiving, and brought a party of 10 to Eggworks at 9am on Sunday morning.  I called in ahead of time and they were gracious enough to take a reservation, even though that's outside the norm for them.  Two of us in the party are Vegan (my husband and I).  We knew the menu, and knew we would need to modify dishes to meet our dietary needs, but I was disappointed w/ the lack of accommodation the restaurant provided.  We each ordered the Veggie Skillet, no cheese, no eggs and asked if we could get avocado instead.  We were told we would need to pay extra for the avocado.  I reminded the waitress that per their menu, a side of avocado costs more than a side of eggs and cheese (arguably the most expensive parts of the dish) and she advised there was nothing she could do.  Had it just been the two of us, we probably would have walked out instead of paying $15.00 each for a dish of veggies and potatoes, but we had 8 other people with us so we bit our tongues, and paid for the extra avocado.  The meal was tasty, but that's besides the point.  In addition, they offer no non-dairy milk for their coffee, so we had to pass on that as well (non-dairy creamer still has milk products in it).  Come on, most breakfast and coffee houses around town at least have an almond or soy milk option.  The vegan community in Vegas is only getting stronger, if a restaurant isn't going to have vegan options on the menu, they should be accommodating of the vegans that do still frequent the restaurant.  I e-mailed the restaurant that morning, it is now two days later and I haven't heard a peep, hence why I decided to write this review.  The next time I have a large party like this, I will take them to many of the other restaurants in town, where we can all be accommodated."}
{"text":"Today was our first time at Egg Works. We arrived during the Sunday morning rush but we were seated within 10 minutes. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our waitress Danielle was kind enough to immediately bring a new cappuccino when we said it lacked flavor. The food came so fast we thought we stole someone's order. The decor is cozy and comfy like grandmas kitchen. We had The traditional Benny and the Ensenada burrito, both were superb! We will definitely be coming back as regulars. Great spot. The habla Diablo sauce is a must have. Thank you so much to Danielle for making the experience great!!"}
{"text":"Oh my Gosh! The food at this place is sooo delicious and flavorful. My tastebuds were pleasantly surprised and wanted more. I had an omelette and it was so flavorful and fresh and I cannot stop raving about it. The seasoned potatoes were great just as well. All the spices used here were just enough for you to thank your taste buds. Orange juice was freshly squeezed. It just tasted so fresh and awesome.The place itself is very casual but the breakfast here is to die for. I just loved the food here and will try again if ever in town! :)"}
{"text":"The food is always good but the service by PK is awesome!  He serves good food, always with a big smile. He definitely brings the Aloha!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I have been to. Large portions, delicious food and very fast service."}
{"text":"Robert was our server, attentive and friendly. Had mushroom omelet with coffee, love the creamers. I love this place. What else could I say. Hopefully you will love it too.  If not allergic, get the Banana nut muffin. So many options for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and Kathleen was great!  Highly recommend the potatoes, best we ever had!"}
{"text":"Just got back from breakfast and I have to say, you could do better than eating here.  The place is busy, so I may be in the minority on giving this a less than stellar review, but there are some important things to point out:  The Good:  - Friendly and attentive service - Food was hot when served.  The not so good:  - I had an omelet - the Western.  Maybe just a personal preference, but the cheese should be IN the omelet, not on it.  When you melt the cheese on top, it overcooks the eggs.  - Omelet eggs are tough, like they are mixed in large batches and watered down.  The egg was very pale and tasteless.  You could see the color difference between these and the scrambled eggs.  - Fillings, onion, pepper, mushrooms and ham, were not flavorful and over cooked.  Also chopped very small.   - POTATOES - They have some type of house seasoning that they put on the potatoes.  Fine.  However, there was so much of this salty seasoning on them that they were inedible.  This was true for all three plates delivered to the table.  Way too salty.  - Toast was cold and soggy.  Finally, a smaller issue but one that always gets me, the check was delivered with our entrees.  This always makes me feel like we are getting rushed to turn the table over.  Not cool.  One other item:  Not once or twice, but four times I heard them apologizing to customers for ill-prepared food or other issues, including us being seated at a table that was not cleaned yet.  It was $44 for three of us to eat with no additional sides, which puts this on the higher end of breakfast in Vegas.  You could get the same quality food from a casino at half the price easily."}
{"text":"To be perfectly honest, I'm not the hugest fan of breakfast food.  I realize this is odd. However, this restaurant does something I don't care much for very, very well.  I always have special requests regarding my breakfast food (egg whites only, I don't eat potatoes so I always have to make substitutions) and I've never felt like I am being a nuisance.  Their omelettes are divine.  The service is always friendly and quick.  I can't really say anything bad about Egg Works 2!"}
{"text":"In my book, great customer service doesn't automattically translate into a higher rating as reviews should be focused on the food.  But there are a few exceptions and this is one of them.  Our waiter, Manny gave excellent customer service, was very friendly, patient and explained the menu items to us.  The whole restaurant has the home town vibe and is very welcoming.  They have a cute system where if you need something, you turn a tag to the unhappy face.  For the food, this is an excellent breakfast spread.  Be careful when ordering, these are big portions.  The breakfast burrito is a classic dish with beans, eggs, and your choice of protein.  They give tons of potatoes.  The skillets are offered every way you can imagine.  We could barely finish the half order, imagine how a full order would look like.  The total bill for three of us was a tad of $30, it's a great deal.  Recommended."}
{"text":"After eating at all the breakfast buffets on the strip, a mom and pop diner was much desired.   Even though my husband and I visited on a weekend, we did not have to wait more than 10mins before we were seated.   The restaurant is quaint and all the servers were friendly and efficient.   Our food was delicious, largely portioned and reasonably priced. If you're looking for a simple and delicious breakfast, don't hesitate to visit this place."}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome. Lots of food and Ashley was fantastic.  The banana nut muffins are to die for.  Came back for day two of our trip. Today we had Brandi as our server. She was awesome as well.   Both Ashley and Brandi were very friendly and waited on us with a smile."}
{"text":"On of the best places for breakfast is Egg works. Food was yummy and menu is extensive with a vast variety of choices between breakfast and lunch items.Big portions,service is good and fast,reasonable price. Busy place with homy atmosphere. We will definitely come again :)"}
{"text":"I didn't feel like driving too far from my neighborhood to find great spots to eat so I found this place as an alternative.  The service was good, but the food was just okay for me. I had the Biscuits/Gravy with Egg. The potatoes were fantastic and the eggs were good. The gravy on the biscuits was bland, I added some hot sauce it didn't do anything to add flavor.   I might be back to try other things."}
{"text":"Rachel and Sidney were exceptional, great service, great food. Would come back again just for them and the waffles ."}
{"text":"I love the egg works chain, but I think this might be my favorite out of all the locations!   It's always busy, but the service is always friendly. I love sitting on the patio so my son can enjoy the planes landing. It totally makes the outside experience! And it has enough roof coverage to create shade so your not basking in the sun.   I normal get the veggie benny, it's my favorite! It's served on an English muffin with spinach tomato and avocado with their home made hollandaise with their fresh potatoes on the side that are generously seasoned. I get this every time I come here, I am a creature of habit! BUT today I switched things up as we came later in the day and got the veggie pesto grilled sandwich! And that was delicious as well! With grilled zucchini, squash, tomatoes and peppers served on a grilled bread with pesto and topped with mozzarella!! It was so good, and I got it with their shoe string fries which were crunchy and crispy and seasoned like there potatoes! It was great!   So if you can manage to wait a little for a table I would recommend eating here, if you can wait a little longer, watching the planes land while enjoying delicious food and hot coffee is always a good start to the day!!"}
{"text":"When in Vegas, try this place, you must!  This is my second time coming here.  It will definitely be a tradition everything I come to Vegas to make this my last stop before heading back to L.A.  Everything on the menu is good.  The service us awesome.  Michelle was our server and she's excellent!  Make sure you pick up a hot sauce from their general store."}
{"text":"Great spot to get breakfast with a full bar and a mighty tasty bloody mary. We went twice. The Apple cinnamon pancakes are excellent as well. Terrific service despite being BUSY both times. Wait time was only 5 to 10 minutes each time, totally worth it. And the breakfast potatoes are super good and seasoned well."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of egg options. and I mean.. a lot. I think they had 4-5 pages worth of different types of breakfast. I was a bit.. overwhelmed.  I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy with eggs and bacon. It was freakin' amazing. It's possible that I could have been hungover and anything hearty tasted good. That said, I'd still come back to try out their other options.  Anyhow, there's no wait on a Monday, and the waitresses were very attentive and kind. Food arrived promptly and we were on away shortly after we scarfed down our breakfast."}
{"text":"Hardy and delicious breakfast and brunch food. Ambience is cozy and family friendly. Wait is attentive but not overbearing. I highly recommend coming hear for breakfast. The chicken, mushroom and spinach skillet and banana nut muffin are amazingly good."}
{"text":"Breakfast with the grandparents? Go to Egg Works! Hungover? Go to Egg Works! Gotta take the kids out in public? Go to Egg Works!  Family-friendly casual style dining that post-Jager bomb college kids can also appreciate. Really enjoyed watching both demographics fill up the joint on a Monday morning before Christmas. Perhaps there were some vacationers in the mix, but for the most part, it seemed like a locals joint.  Probably the best thing about the menu is the wide variety of dishes, anything from healthy scrambles to cream cheese stuffed French toast. Which do you think I chose? Damn straight I had the French toast! Ho ho ho... gettin' that Santa belly ready! My parents leaned on the other side of the spectrum, taking their bran muffins to go for a snack. Since when is bran ever a snack, btw?  Waitresses are as sweet as the strawberry topping on my giant plate of goodness. Definitely the \"sweetie\" and \"hun\" crew. There's usually about 2-3 lovely ladies taking orders, cleaning plates and running food, so tip them for their hard work, folks.   Solid breakfast food served with a smile and some syrup... What's not to like?"}
{"text":"The best place to go after Sunday church. Or before church lol every item of the menu tastes delicious. I really wish the place was a lil bit bigger bcause it does get very crowded at times & the wait can be very long. I like the staff."}
{"text":"This place is \"Eggs\"tremely awesome! The food is wonderful. So many choices. If you are ever in Las Vegas...this restaurant is a must. And our waitress Dolly was the bomb. She was just the right amount of attentive.  Again this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"I love breakfast!  It was my first time here and EW2 didn't disappoint. Even the 20min wait was worth it. Great, friendly service even during a packed house at noon on a Sunday. Accommodating our large group was not a big deal.   Reading over the newspaper like menu, there were so many items to choose from even three hawaiian dishes! I went with The Works Skillet, even though the stuffed french sounded amazing. The works skillet is packed with flavor and textures. I really enjoyed the banana nut muffin as well. My sis got the Haole Moco and that looked very good as well. The other orders in our party all looked great. (drool)  Being in Vegas, I had to keep the vibe going, so i got the Greyhound (vodka and grapefruit) and it was darn good.   Also, we had two birthday celebrants in our party and our server brought out decorated banana nut muffins with a candle. We all sang \"happy birthday\". That was fun!  EW2 you're now on my list of favs in Vegas! Being off the strip, it's a nice little drive away from the touristy atmosphere.  Also read, Joanne C's review. :D"}
{"text":"Love the food and variety at Egg Works!  The menu is huge!! It's always a task to choose what to order. My go-tos have been the corned beef hash, Hawaiian style dishes, omelets, and the skillets. If you're one hungry, hungry person, you'll be happy with the portions.   One of the must-gets is the Banana nut muffin! Usually it's included as an option with many of the entrées, but if not, be sure to check into yelp, and get one for FREE!!   Recently, it was my first time at this location and I've been to other locations though. All have had good, friendly service. For warned, expect to wait, on average, 20-40min minutes on peak breakfast and lunch times as well as weekends*. But it's so worth it. It gives you time to look over the extensive menu anyway. You're welcome!  *Note: At this location, you give them your cell number and you can check status on the link they text you until they let you know your table is ready. Very cool!   Looking forward to returning to LV. I will be back."}
{"text":"Went here on s recommendation  it was so buddy we could not get in. Second time we got a table service great  food was great loved the omelette And hash browns were great. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Went there about 2 mornings ago with my wife... got seated and sat for about 7 minutes or more and nobody acknowledged us.. then  2 guys sat at the table next to us and within 30 sec got their drink order taken. Tried to get some attention but still nothing. About a minute later the waitress goes and takes the food order of the 2 guys next to us and we still haven't even gotten acknowledged. Another min or so passes and I'm getting pissed. We finally get some attention but by this time we are ready To leave this place. I'm from hawaii and now reside here in Vegas. My wife and I eat out alot and have never experienced this kind of treatment before. The ladies working that day were I believe Hispanic, and seems like they were probably racist of my type of people. A few friends of mine have also recieved this kind  service at this specific location on rainbow blvd. This place NEEDS to get their shit straight cause it's becoming Way too obvious and will bite them in the ass one day"}
{"text":"Had an amazing breakfast!  Veronica was amazing! Working at a breakfast place myself, I'm glad to see other restaurants aspiring to such good standards."}
{"text":"Great place, portions might be a tad to big for a breakfast place. Don't wanna feel disgusting the whole day, other than that really good food and service."}
{"text":"Wow where have I been pass this place everyday and always thought it just another breakfast joint...how wrong I was stopped for an early bird breakfast on Saturday and was pleasantly surprised the food was fantastic had a bacon avocado omelette, house potatoes were to die for coffee is hot and plentiful service fast and friendly. I'd say when you do something well don't change a thing. I will be back!!"}
{"text":".We love this place and Kelli is great. The Island Favorite is always fresh.  Portions are perfect"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Ask for PK to be your servant. He's great. He'll do anything you ask him. I almost always get the classic. It's a great choice since Egg Works uses the best eggs, the best bread, and the best of everything. You can tell the kitchen is full of love when they make their food."}
{"text":"My dad has been bring my kids here for a while on the Saturdays when he watches them and my kids have been begging to go for a while so I finally broke done and we went. I was great they weren't that busy so we got our food fast and had great service. Our server Christopher was great has catered to my kids which always wins points in my book. The food was great to. They have pancakes in the shape of mickey mouse for the kids and me skillet breakfast was great."}
{"text":"Really good! Lots of choices and great service. Food was brought out quickly too. The only thing I didn't like was how loud it was."}
{"text":"I absolutely love loco moco and i couldn't imagine finding AMAZING loco moco here!! It's so yummy and the meat is super duper juicy and thick! I usually get over medium eggs for loco moco so the yellow egg yolk can be runny with all the gravy, rice, and meat combined! The rice was sticky and perfectly cooked, the egg is exactly how i wanted, and the meat i got was well done and so flavorful! I couldn't imagine having this amazing loco moco and beating my all time fave place to get loco moco (L&L).   The service was super fast & caring. The server was really attentive and the food came out fast as well! There wasn't a wait time despite it being packed! I love how there's a variety of american breakfast dishes as well as hawaiian! There's so many different dishes options. The portion plates are huge as well! Their menus are adorable newspaper style, with a lot of cute decorations around the restaurant. I love eating breakfast here!"}
{"text":"Always love this place for breakfast. Today I went to have some quality time with my 10 year old son, and Travis our waiter was on point. Egg Works NEVER disappoints."}
{"text":"Probably our most favorite breakfast place. All of the locations are good. The owner is awesome!  The food is always fresh, hot, and delicious. The staff is friendly and fast. We enjoy taking our dog and sitting on the dog-friendly patio. It's always clean."}
{"text":"This place is great! Great food, and great service! Maryann was awesome! I had the Santa Cruz burrito. It was so the best! The banana muffins are delicious!"}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast! Portions are huge- 4 egg omlette fair warning!  I am a biscuits and gravy snob and found their version excellent coffee was very good and I wisely got a half order works skillet. Don't go to a chain restaurant when this is right here!"}
{"text":"When in Vegas for business or pleasure, I always stop here for breakfast at least once during my stay. As mentioned everywhere, the banana nut muffin is super tasty.   The service has always been great, with special mention going to the happy egg / sad egg sign. The sign is cute, but what really deserves mentioning is the fact that if you flip this baby to sad egg, you will get help from whoever on the staff sees this. Any other place, and you are going to have to wait for YOUR server to come around....not so at Egg Works! I have been assisted by other servers, the manager, and even the hostess has stopped to help when they see that I am needing assistance. This is a huge plus for me. I love the team mentality.   The menu is huge. The variety of choices is amazing. I have yet to order the same thing twice, intent on broadening my horizons each time I visit. The burgers are good too, and yes, have one for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love Egg Works! It's always busy, but have never had to wait more than 10 minutes. I have tried many things, but my favorite is the Sunrise Mountain with bacon. So yummy and cheesy!! And I really like that you can get different sides besides the potatoes. I'm not a huge potato fan at breakfast, so I always get cottage cheese and there is no extra charge! BONUS!! Alexa is a wonderful server. She kept our drinks full and even gave me a Diet Coke to go too!!! This is one of my favorite breakfast places in Henderson!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  Thank you Donna! You were so pleasant and had a great idea with the Veggie Omelet & broccoli. Delish!"}
{"text":"Good food, decent bloody Mary that wasn't over the top like some of them in Las Vegas, and without the over the top price either. Bridgette was a great server!"}
{"text":"My family loves to visit egg works whenever in Vegas. The banana nut muffins are delicious and the Loco Moco Hawaiian style breakfast was so yummy. Everyone that works there is very nice and helpful. Our waitress Donna was very friendly and gave us great service."}
{"text":"Nice and clean. Really nice service. Welcoming faces. Food presentation is IMMACULATE. Try there avocado bacon omelet the best and there Hawaiian french Toast"}
{"text":"In Vegas for a conference and this place was close by the airport. Overall, ok food. Wait time was long but they tried to get us in fast.   I had the basic 2 eggs, potatoes, toast. My co-worker had the hash and it turned out too dry and burnt. He didn't like it.   Service was friendly enough but the food did take some time to come out. It is a very busy place w lots of people coming and going."}
{"text":"The wait is worth it! They skipped our name -__- but the food made it okay! Lol I had a mimosa and a blt! Soooo good! Our waiter was great! Deff recommend it!"}
{"text":"Heather, @EggWorks Key Manager of 215/Rainbow, is all smile on Father's Day. #AwesomeService!!! 5-star with 10 thumbs up!!!  #lasvegas"}
{"text":"Customized for healthy eaters loved the buckwheat pancakes.  Server gave us more energy than the coffee lol pk I think his name was. Great place overall"}
{"text":"Customized for a healthy diet . Worth the wait on the weekends . Love the buckwheat pancakes and omelets"}
{"text":"Just can here on my way to work to pick up a quick meal, the reason I'm leaving a review is the waitress Marianne just had such a positive and great work ethic. She did everything right it's very refreshing !"}
{"text":"Had a great time at this Egg Works! The customer service is outstanding! Plus our waitress Donna was amazing!!"}
{"text":"I come here from time to time and never had a problem, today I placed an order and had some miscommunication with the phone person. Katie comped my entire meal. Staffs always nice."}
{"text":"Very dissapointed! No comparison to the cracked egg which is right down the street. Food is bland! Nothing special about this place at all!"}
{"text":"Adrienne was amazing!  I was here with my parents and wife and we had a great experience.  She was friendly and attentive.  The food was great, super quick service!  Thanks do much Adrienne!"}
{"text":"My review goes to the sitting staff. Starting off by walking in and putting my name down to be called. We were told our wait time will be 15 mins. Which is an awesome wait time for such a busy restaurant. My name was called, Kat! Party of 3! We walked to the booth seeing that they had taken someone else by the name of Catalina and not Kat. Being swooped on our table for Catalina party of 2. Yes party of 2 was the first clue that the wrong person was called. They said that this has never happened and didn't know how you react to it. Best thing they should've done was go back to her table and apologize and say that it's Kat party of 3 that was called . Knowing her party had just gotten to the restaurant... Instead we waited for another 10mins for a table to be cleared while they called me Catalina to be seated.  The one star goes to being called another persons name.  The food review will come later.."}
{"text":"Very good and fast seating! Me and a friend couldn't stop talking how good the food was while we were eatting it!  I usually can finish a big meal but this one was very hard and I failed. That is a good fail though because they gave you a lot for a good price!"}
{"text":"The chili relleno omelette was the bomb, add the sour cream and salsa.... Party in your mouth! I can't wait to come back to Vegas to have it again... It is a must try fo sho!!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  We were visiting from out of town and we were quickly seated, and greeted by the waiter just as fast.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy...yum!  The biscuits were to die for.  Also, I had potatoes, turkey bacon and eggs.  All were cooked perfectly.  The waiter, Joshua, was attentive the entire time even though they were extremely busy.   All in all, a great place to check out and get stuffed."}
{"text":"We were seated and served quickly. Our avocado omellette, banana nut muffin and french toast was delicious.  The female server was professional and prompt. No complaints."}
{"text":"oh yeah...;)  would the \"bf\" agree on my four stars, maybe not but we are not asking him, are we?  So...visited the first day of the new year.  Seated after a 30 minute wait at about 11am (ish).  Seated, and our coffee (crappy coffee -- we cannot even discuss here) taken by a coked-out server. Prior to even being brought coffee, my bf observed (saw, with his own eyes!) our server putting his fingers in his mouth, not sure why. We caught a passing hostess, retold our \"issue\" (server/fingers/mouth = uncomfortable) and not but two minutes later...greeted by a different server --- thank you. THANK YOU! I really appreciate this attentive service and saving of our brunch/breakfast.   The bf ordered the stuffed french toast with eggies, bacon and....some sort of potato. good. not what i would order...but....what can i say.  I had, egg white omelet, with spinach (extra spinach), mushrooms, and Swiss. Could not decide if i wanted to be totally \"bad\" or just a little bit bad, so the server suggested i have 1/2 tomatoes and 1/2 some sort of potato. Thank you...for recognizing.   I did order a side of hallandise AND a side of sausage gravy --- i ordered egg whites didn't i? and i just wanted to taste... 2oz portion of each, enough to know for next time.   everything was completely greasy spoon - type, and...really what we needed, just.... wanted and...was.   this place is great.   could i cajole my bf to another meal, um...i think so. (he doesn't even like eggs - so .. i can only say 'wtf')   i was happy ...greasy spoon -- but plus plus plus...  i would probably order again my same order. it is...better than average, certainly. local. decent. no airs.... i go back."}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I go on the weekends and sit at the bar. Staff is amazing, food is great and customer service is the best! Love that we can find a place where the staff is friendly and remembers us and our orders."}
{"text":"Wow !!!! I shared my experience with management and was surprised at how fast they got back to me. They are addressing the situation and I am happy to say I am so satisfied with the customer service.  This company really cares about their customers!!! Thank you Daniela."}
{"text":"Who would have thought a place named Egg Works would have tasted so good. I came here because my dad kept telling me to try this place out, since we were always in the area.  Anyways, we went there about 10am and the place was packed! We had to wait for a table that seated 4adults and 1 child, which was about 25mins but that was okay, we had plenty of time to chill outside. We were finally called in and the waitress was pleasant. My bf and I, were still thinking of what to order while dad and cousin already knew what to get. We decided to just share a plate that had fresh corned beef, option of getting that or the canned version (no thanks, fresh is always better), my dad got I believe the egg combo?? I could be wrong I forgot the name. He got a half serving because they have half servings there which is a plus because I don't eat much.  As we were waiting, we seen this egg shape happy face at the end of table, my cousin explained to us that there are two faces, one sad and one happy. If you need service you would just flip the happy to the sad face and a waitress will come over. As he was showing us, I kid you not like 2secs later a waitress came by and ask if everything was okay. I was impressed but we just simply told her that we were just curious of what that was.   Our food came, it was delicious! I tried some of my dads food and it was really great. I liked mine more because my Filipino side loves corn beef canned or not ha ha. My cousins daughter had a fresh banana muffin and of course we stole a piece from her when she wasn't looking because she will not let that go, and that was really tasty. Of course being such \"tourist\" we decided to take a pic of the egg and flipped it once again and 5secs later the waitress came up and asked what was wrong. Still so amazed on how quick she came again!   The food here is great so try it out (it doesn't hurt to try right?) and the service was just as great. I like this place and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Awesome service from Ashley H! Friendly and professional. Best eggs and toast in town."}
{"text":"Food is good and the service is great, our server was Sarah amazing service looking forward to our next visit"}
{"text":"First time here for breakfasts, food was great, staff was awesome. They really know how to provide customer service. Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"I was uneasy walking in.  It is a huge space with tons of people waiting for a table and the background roar of the hungry breakfast crowd is hard to ignore.  But before we knew it, the hostess is calling our name and we're being shuffled through the restaurant to a more than accommodating table.   Christopher, our server, was great.  He checked on us frequently and was very courteous.  I had the special for the day, the firecracker scramble.  It was cheesy, spicy, saucy, and huge!  Everything I wanted.  I actually fed the last of it to my fiancé -- I was defeated.    The banana nut muffin is ridiculous.  I don't know what to make of this thing.  The muffin top isn't your run-of-the-mill rounded little top, but a flying saucer of sorts just perched right up there like nobody's business.  I'm upset we didn't get a dozen to take back with us.  Ain't no muffin like an Egg Works muffin!"}
{"text":"Easy to find a  parking space, when busy not to long of a wait, service is great and clean... Unfortunately there is way too much seasoning on potatoes , next time i better try hash browns, if they have that option? And the omelets and crepes tend to get cooked too much and so inside ingredients tend to be dry.. But the portions are huge and they offer a 2 for 1 buy coupon in the local paper. And the best thing that comes with breakfast instead of toast,opt for the banana nut muffin, that is real yummy..."}
{"text":"Our last stop before heading back to LA. This place is pretty packed on Sunday morning but we got seated real fast.   We had Country Fried Chicken and Mashed Potatoes Omelets. Their portion is big and it comes with muffin or toast. If you want extra muffin, you can check on yelp to get free banana nut muffin!   I love the food, better than other breakfast place. The gravy and fried chicken are perfectly cooked. The only minus point is our potatoes are too salty, too much seasoning I guess since we compared to another plate of potatoes. Other than that, everything is good and servers are friendly."}
{"text":"My kids and I went to this restaurant after reading the good reviews on Yelp. The food was fine. It was fairly good - really sweet, but still good. (My kids couldn't finish because their pancakes were really sweet with the syrup and whipped cream.) My omelet needed salt. But otherwise good food. A muffin came with my meal - it was super sweet. My main complaint is the price. I couldn't believe the bill. My two small kids ordered from the kid's menu. I ordered an omelet. We all had beverages. And our bill was OVER $50! I would have expected that at a pricey place on the strip, but not at a breakfast restaurant across from a Wal-Mart. The prices are just too high. We walked out $57 poorer. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We got into town late morning yesterday (Sat. of Labor Day weekend) and drove to Mr. Mamas in the hopes of trying it. We found the place when we spotted the large crowd in front of it. So we figured we'll try this Egg Works (we've now been to 3 Egg Works/Egg & I locations) as it's really close to our new house we bought in Summerlin.  The service, like the other 2 locations, is great. So nice to see people who actually like their jobs (or at least very good at faking it if they're not), from the hostess, to the waitress and the cashier (she was a hoot).  I tried the chicken fried steak skillet and holy poop, it was AWESOME!!!  My husband ordered eggs & bacon and after tasting mine, said \"I should have ordered that.\"  We look forward to becoming regulars here soon, based on the wonderful service and the really really good and very reasonably priced food."}
{"text":"The food was good. But the customer experience in this location is poor. They are too busy to want to provide a good quality experience. There food is way too expensive to be rushed and hurried out the door. I would rather patronize a business that appreciates my dollars."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. We were greeted and seated by Kaitlyn... smart businesses employ great hostesses. Great job Kaitlyn. Our server was Dana, and equally spectacular. I had the avacodo omellete with turkey sausage and fruit... excellent. Great food, large portions.... of course the banana nut muffin is a must."}
{"text":"This place has horrible food. The kitchen is a wreck and needs new leadership. Three other patrons were returning food at the same time we were. Dont eat here"}
{"text":"Very good..Wow! Loved it..The ingredients are especially fresh, always important in a breakfast and lunch only restaurant. Enjoyed everything. I went alone, was not made to feel lonely..great service. Their menu items are great! Must try..."}
{"text":"The best Eggs Benedict I've ever had. It's all I eat there. Yes, I've had their huge Belgium waffles and their choco chip pancakes but the eggs Benedict is the best!   They put their benedict in a broiling dish and smother it in holladasie sauce. They top it with a little caynee pepper and put it under the broiler for a minute or two. It also comes with a huge side of cajun style home fries. Absolutely amazing.   The service is spot on. Friendly smiles and great attitudes. If you don't like something, you simply flip your egg over on your table (it's part of the menu holder) and they come fast as can be. Always someone running around with coffee so your cup never goes empty. It's what all breakfast place should be!   When in Vegas, avoid the hotel buffet and come here. It's awesome! You won't leave disappointed. Just make sure to get here early on the weekends. It can be a little busy..."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place. Have not had anything that I did not like. Decent prices, friendly staff and awesome food."}
{"text":"Celebrity sightings alert! Given the star power that regularly graces the Strip, my Egg Works sighting might not be too stirring, but when I saw members of the Wranglers hockey team, it thrilled me. They practice at the nearby ice facility, so I imagine they do coffee and eggs at the Works fairly often.  I do too, but I must admit that the 2 for 1 entrée coupons in my edition of The View are a big big incentive, as is the banana nut muffin. That muffin is habit forming! Just so you know, the muffin is an option in addition to the usual toast you get offered at breakfast restaurants.  Muffin or toast: you would be crazy not to choose this muffin.  Egg Works is technically a chain; the sister restaurant close to us is The Egg & I, but I think Egg Works is a smidgen nicer. It is a newer location. There is also Egg Works II on Sunset. Completely unrelated to the food, but they have a great website, so if you have any questions, you should visit it.  As you may have guessed, eggs are their specialty, so there are plenty of omelets and scrambles and sunny-side ups. The menu is pretty extensive, and they do have non-egg items such as buckwheat pancakes! They also have lunch, including hamburgers. They offer egg whites and egg substitute in addition to your regular chicken eggs. Often, the tastiest thing is their special of the day. The best thing I have eaten there was a chicken and pesto scramble special! Generally, I will get a scramble with vegetables, which are always fresh, not canned. I will say that the eggs can taste pretty plain, but I think they want to leave it to you to add salt, pepper and hot sauce to satisfy your own personal taste level.   The serving sizes are very generous and include a mighty helping of their breakfast potatoes. The potatoes are diced and are not greasy at all. The secret to their tastiness is the magic dust--a little spicy, a little salty, a lot of yummy.   The service is always attentive, and the servers generally look like they are having fun. They work as a team, which always makes service snappier. If you need something, there is a little egg on your table that you can flip. Now that's using your egg. Bwahahaha!  Overall, I think that Egg Works is a solid option for breakfast. There is something for everyone, the ingredients are fresh and the execution is respeggtable. (I can't resist a good egg pun.)"}
{"text":"This is my third time coming here since they have a groupon. The food was so so, I had the loco moco and my bf had the bbq burger. The burgers are huge but the fries were super thin. My loco moco was ok, the rice was a bit hard and the meat patty was dry. Our server was pretty slow, we had to keep looking for her to get a refill or ask another server to call her. The previous times we went was better but today the server sorta ruined it and so did the food. I do recommend getting the chicken fried steak!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  We visit Henderson every year and stay with our friends...this has been a staple for breakfast over the years.  The service is always great as well as the food.  The corned beef hash is great, as is the Santa Cruz skillet, but my go-to is usually the Crazy Chicken Omelette.  Their seasoned potatoes are really good, and I'm not usually a fan of the cube-like potatos.  My hubby's fave is the 5-way Cincy Chili which (in case you don't know) is chili on spaghetti, then add cheese, onion, etc.  The chili is not normal Tex-Mex chili...it is a chili sauce and is a bit sweet, so I'm not a fan, but he LOVES it!  They also sell their own bloody mary mix, which I have got to buy and try one of these trips."}
{"text":"Jennifer is amazing!!! Seriously the best service! The food is amazing and even though they were busy there was little wait to be seated and our food came out within 10 min of ordering"}
{"text":"Friendly open atmosphere with attentive staff and wide menu options. Good for breakfast with fast service and decent prices."}
{"text":"Best customer service and the food was amazing! Even the toast was amazing. Marc was our waiter and had a trainee named nancy who was great too. They definitely earned a regular customer."}
{"text":"So eggworks is a hit and miss  We have been going here for about 6 years and watched them grow and have tried several of the different locations depending on where our day was going to take us... I have to say each location the food does have a little different taste, same menu but I order almost the same thing here and it is better on one location then another I love brunch so unless I am going to go to LA or the strip and want a nice variety, we have 4 spots and this one tends to get us fed at least once a month, however it seems the larger they get the quality drops...  as well as the service has seemed to suffer since their boom..  I always get a skillet and friends get egg white omlets, pancakes etc. We always leave full and it is a good spot to have a good brunch, just a pain during 11-2 but that's a good thing since they are busy.  Their orange juice is always freshly squeezed, coffee is always a bit burnt so expect to add extra sugar.  Yummy banana muffins (they do have nuts so warning if you are allergic)   Portions are great and you can get half sizes which is nice compared to other places.  They Rarely get the bacon or meat products cooked to order but the eggs are usually spot on (perhaps that's why it's called egg works ha ha) They used to have fresh fruit on every plate but for some reason discontinued that practice.  Pancakes are always huge and kid portions are enough to feed a teen so no skimping there...  Good comfort breakfast foods..."}
{"text":"Comfort breakfast food!  This place makes the best Banana muffins and I love their skillets..I always get the chicken cordon blue skillet and add avocados and hollandaise sauce (they even take out the calories for me )  Service is always great and they are very accommodating to whatever we need .  So if your in the mood for some breakfast or lunch this is a great place, they even have healthy choices and yummy beef stew.."}
{"text":"The hostess Nicole is the best! She's always super sweet and has the best customer service. It's always a pleasure to come see her and eat the best breakfast food ever! Definitely recommend this place it's very homey in the food is always bomb :)"}
{"text":"No wait on Saturday morning.  Excellent service and large portions of food, everything was very tasty. Our waitress Carla showed good hospitality with quick service, we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location. It is easy to find on the southeast corner of 215 and Rainbow.  It was a Sunday at 1 pm and I had expected a long wait but was pleasantly surprised when, even with a crowd of people in the lobby, we were seated almost immediately. There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating to accommodate the crowds.   The menu is extensive and, even with that, the restaurant is happy to make adjustments to your orders when requested. I had the vegetable omelet and added avocado. It was light, fluffy and delicious. I thought that they forgot the avocado at first since it wasn't on top but there was plenty on the inside!  The seasoned potatoes were quite good as well. I didn't have the muffin that I read all the raves about.   The service was quick and our server and the manager checked in with us during our meal as well.   I would definitely return when I want a great omelet!"}
{"text":"We come here every Sunday and we try something new each time, we love the service and delicious breakfast. The key largo crepe and stuffed French toast are a few of my favorites. My son is always asking for the potatoes and a muffin and my husband always getting a new special. Thank you for the friendly faces, fast service and making our Sunday's mornings memorable."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Good service. Clean place."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to Egg Works after passing it numerous times. First thing, it is cool to see the toy train goes around the restaurant. Keeps you entertained while waiting for your name to be called. During our visit, we tried their regular egg burrito, avocado omelet, chicken fried steak, and beef burrito. They were all delicious and yummy. I jokingly made a comment about the sauce tasting like Taco Bell but was told by my companion that it might taste like Taco Bell but it is fresh. The portions are big, I can stay a two person can split it and still be full. They give a lot of potatoes on each of our plates. We did not finish it all. Also, their banana nut muffin is great! I could come to this place and just eat that! If you are wanting huge delicious breakfast and in the area, I recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"I love Egg Works. This is the first time I've been to this location, and they did not disappoint.   It was PACKED on a Saturday morning, but the wait time was estimated at about 10 minutes.  7 minutes later we were seated.  I'd been dying to try Eggs Benedict for weeks.  I found a recipe online that I want to try, but I'd never had it before, and had no idea what a hollandaise sauce was supposed to taste like.   I ordered the Spinach Benny, which is the traditional EB dish, with spinach leaves.  I DEVOURED it.  It was so tasty!  The English Muffin was delicious, the Canadian Bacon was flavorful, and the eggs were poached to perfection.  I just love when the yolk oozes out nice and slowly...I love poached eggs.  So much.  The hollandaise was light, delicate and YUMMY!  I can only hope that my own turns out this good.  The works potatoes served on the side were delicious too, and were seasoned very well.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The service was no good and the food was 2 stars We tryed this place because of the ratings ...nope never again i choose dennies over this place"}
{"text":"Thought this location was probably one of the better ones in town. Came here on a Saturday morning, considering the amount of people, the wait was less than 10 minutes. They have outside and inside seating. The service sitting outside was not so great, but it's worth it if it's a nice sunny day :D   Excellent breakfast spot. And great if your trying to eat light and healthy as well. The menu has a variety of options, eggs (durr) waffles, pancakes, breakfast meats, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, and the absolute best part MIMOSAS AND SCREWDRIVERS. I wasn't impressed with the mimosas but holy moly the screwdriver was served in a mason jar and deceptively strong :D  I had two eggs, WHEAT Banana pancakes, and a fruit granola parfait. The eggs were de-lish, especially when I sprinkled some of the provided greensauce on them. I admired how they made the pancakes with real cut banana slices cooked inside them. And I think the menu description \"short-stack\" is somewhat of an understatement, try HUGE ROUND STACK of three pancakes. Also, try sharing them with someone else, too much for one in my opinion- unless you're a beast. The fruit parfait was disappointing- too much yogurt, not enough granola or fruit.   Of course this chain of restaurants is most famous for their banana nut muffin- and yes- have one, you won't regret it. Overall, great spot for an early breakfast with friends and fam."}
{"text":"Everything people say about this place is true! The food was excellent and the orange juice was beyond amazing!"}
{"text":"Our server Veronica, was awesome! She really likes her job and interacting with people, and it shows! So nice to actually have good service. Our food came out fast, and it was delicious! They also give a military discount as well. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place, to bad there isn't one in California! Had the Mexican omelette and my husband had the Mashed potato omelette. Yummy! Everything tasty. Great friendly service. Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"I came to eat here with my sister and my mother on Monday. The food is on hit! Like the portions are great and everything was so yummy.  The look of the place might not be fancy but it's very clean and welcoming.  The service though. The service is what is making our family is excited to eat there again when we return to Vegas.  Candice I hope I spelled her name right. She was soooooo sweet and super attentive and just a delight. Like she made the experience THAT much better.  I can't wait to eat here again. I wish we had one in San Francisco  Thank you egg works!"}
{"text":"My regular breakfast place. Never disappointed with the food, service or atmosphere. Everytime I come I try something new on the menu. There's a little bit of everything to fulfill any cravings."}
{"text":"Food was so yummy!  I had fried eggs, bacon, home fries and a side of chorizo.  Not sure which was the food item...including the banana nut muffin served at the beginning of the meal.  Great service, and, they have a dog-friendly patio...that was the bomb!   I like to think of myself as a breakfast connoisseur, and this was definitely in my top 10 across the west coast"}
{"text":"Can we talk about how shitty my experience was just now! I had to wait 10 minutes before I finally got out of my seat to go ask someone for a server to take my order. She comped my coffee... Big deal... My breakfast came with coffee anyway... Now I'm still sitting here after I've been done for 15 min waiting for a Togo box.... Thank you Amy for the shittiest breakfast experience of my life. NEVER COMING BACK!"}
{"text":"Great food. Short wait time while place was packed on Black Friday. Great service by Donna. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place! We come here weekly. Food is always delicious and the service is great. Highly recommend the Cordon Bleu skillet."}
{"text":"This place is always consistent! Great service and food comes out fresh and piping hot every time! They always come check on you several times throughout the meal, I just love this place! We probably eat here at least a few times a month!! And the prices are just right! Portions are HUGE also! Best breakfast spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Always come for their egg white omelette with tomatoes, spinach and pepper jack cheese.... yummy!!!!!!!! For lunchtime I recommend their turkey club sandwich. Service is always friendly and on point, great local spot for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit Las Vegas I have to stop in for the amazing food but more importantly the friendly, energetic staff. Today our waitress, Caitlin was so helpful and always on top of anticipating our needs. She talked me into stepping out of my comfort zone and trying something new. I had the Eggs Benedict Pizza, yup I said PIZZA. Being Italian I am surprised my family has never thought of such a genius idea. Thank you Caitlin I'm so glad you wee our server."}
{"text":"Love me some Loco Moco so I was a little reluctant to try the Haole Moco but I'm so glad I did. Service was excellent too"}
{"text":"Wait Time: Minimal, App/Online updated Food Type: All American wIth Spanish options Staff: Helpfull Location: Off Strip Owner: Family Owned Portions: Generous Future Return: Yes Price: $$  Note: 1 Order was mixed up but before i could bring it up they fixed it ASAP. Portions are very generous and sharing is actually encouraged.   Food is very very good folks."}
{"text":"Food is always great and having a groupon discount never hurts. I love coming here for breakfast. We were at table 13 on Sunday the 11th and DIANA was awesome. She totally deserves a trip to Disney so she can hang with Mickey"}
{"text":"Items Selected: 2 Buttermilk Biscuits Ham, Egg, and Cheese Stuffed French Toast with Strawberry Jam and hash browns Candied Walnut Buttermilk Pancakes (seasonal special)  With household chores needing attention it was largely a matter of location combined with a buy-one-get-one coupon that led me to Summerlin's relatively new Eggworks on Saturday, and having visited sister restaurant \"Egg & I\" nearly a year ago I'm happy to say that its fifth spin-off replicates the formula well, a very competent breakfast served amidst friendly confines fit for any age.  Obviously not the sort of place looking to reinvent the wheel, but rather a locals-only kind of spot where nearly all the patrons present during my early morning meal were 'regulars,' it was with nothing but smiles that I was greeted at the hostess podium at 6:45 and offered a seat at the kitchen-side bar or a table I opted for the later, a small two-top amidst spacious confines already loaded with condiments, menus, and utensils as College Gameday played on televisions all around.  Never shy to over-order, even as my waitress informed me that two entrees was \"a lot,\" it was mere moments after seating that I made my selections and starting with two doughy, $3.49 biscuits finding slight salvation in butter plus honey I quickly realized I should have again ordered the signature banana bread, though things would soon improve, my BOGO coupon yielding a duo of plates nearly overwhelming my small table.  Beginning first with another item dubbed 'signature,' the stuffed French Toast is offered with an option for bacon, sausage, or ham and doing my best to recreate the Monte Cristo the results were admirable - the fluffy eggs loaded with cheddar and chopped pork beneath slices of vanilla scented, golden bread ready to be gilded with syrup or jam.  Moving next to an item from the seasonal menu, a $9.75 three-stack of pancakes was next in line and topping the fluffy discs with pure-maple syrup brought from home plus a few pats of butter I'll be honest when I say these could just be the best buttermilk flapjacks in town, each bite surprisingly light with ample buttermilk tones punctuated by pockets of melting brown sugar and rich caramel with toasty walnuts through and through.  Far larger and brighter than the original Egg & I location with similar smiling service and a 6am opening every day of the week Egg Works Summerlin is a great addition to the neighborhood and with coupons frequently offered in the local mailers serves as a great place for families to enjoy a good breakfast without breaking the bank or succumbing to big chains like Denny's or IHOP.  Certainly not a 'destination,' but a great spot for a leisurely morning while reading the paper, watching gameday, or just sitting on the dog-friendly patio I only wish they advertised specials more prominently, the only indication of those lovely pancakes found on a laminated menu left at the table."}
{"text":"Food was really good! The service as well ! Had the bacon avocado omelette and it was delicious! Great portions and fast . Menu was really big with a huge selection to satisfy everyone ."}
{"text":"Olivia made me smile and treated everyone with her presence!!  What a fabulous cute place!!"}
{"text":"Very good but, remember to ask for eggs soft if you like em that way. Pancakes are very good as well."}
{"text":"I've been over 50 times and will continue to go. Sevice is good, never a long wait and the prime rib benny is addicting."}
{"text":"great place. been here three times so far..the french toast was great but the cinnamon apple pankcakes are awesome..i was gonna try something else last time i went but had to have them again. very fast service and good prices."}
{"text":"This would be my favorite breakfast place for a chain restaurant. We go all the time & not one complaint.  The staff head always been friendly & service is good. I also like that they have a dog friendly patio. I haven't brought my dog yet, but I like seeing all the other dogs there."}
{"text":"There are many places to have breakfast in Vegas and if you're one to venture off the strip and away from the usual breakfast buffets, drive 15 mins west of the strip and try this place out. Egg Works is definitely the place to go for great breakfast. There are plenty of egg dishes from your traditional eggs, bacon and potatoes to a host of different omelete styles.   I tried the Eggs Benny which is essentially a more hearty, country version of the bougie eggs benedict. You can have your eggs served any style, I chose over medium. Service is very quick and we didn't have to wait long for our meal to arrive. The Eggs Benny comes nicely plated with country potatoes and a seperate dish for the biscuits topped with sausage patties and eggs on top. The gravy basically covers the whole dish of biscuits. I should have asked for the gravy on the side, but I was hungry so it didn't matter. The biscuits are flaky and flavorful, the sausage patties are very tasty, and of course the eggs are awesome. The gravy is definitely authentic and tastes the part! The country potatoes are tasty but if not careful, the seasoning could be a little overpowering.   Overall this is a great breakfast spot with tons on the menu to satisfy your hunger. Next time i'm in town, i'm trying the omeletes!"}
{"text":"With so many choices for breakfast, what makes one place stand out from the others? Well, Egg Works (http://www.theeggworks.com/) has a a little something special up its sleeve. Its not the only place that does this, but it definitely a nice change of pace. What is it you ask? Banana nut bread as a toast option! If you didnt get excited by the last sentence, you've got issues! =). On my daily trek to work, I always pass by a mom and pops breakfast place called The Egg and I. Egg Works is by the same people and its closer to my house. We head out on a Sunday morning around 10am and this place is packed. After a minimal wait, we sit down and open the extensive menu. Its one of those menus where you find something you want on every page. After about 15 minutes we finally agree on two dishes. We order the Bacon Avocado Omelette and the Country Fried Steak and eggs. Oh yeah... This is my favorite part. \"What kind of toast would you like with your meal? We've got wheat, white, sourdough, banana nut.\" OMG. Nothing makes a yummy breakfast more yummy than a banana nut muffin that doesnt cost extra! Haha."}
{"text":"Well I've heard a lot about this place and seen a lot of good reviews. Decided to give it a try. I ordered the buckaroo scramble for my son, he seemed to like it. The banana nut muffin that came with it though wasn't the best. I love banana bread/muffins and this one was overdone. I ordered the traditional Benny because I love eggs Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was good and the rest was good too. Nothing super special but not bad either. My husband ordered the country Benny and liked it as well. Our waiter, Brady, was very friendly and accommodating. Overall, it was good but nothing wowed me."}
{"text":"It was my families first time here and we really enjoyed it. Great food! Abby was a great waitress! We'll definitely be coming back:)"}
{"text":"Food, great. Service, great. Outdoor dog friendly patio seating, great. Prices, reasonable. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This dish is way too big, I rather you charge me less with smaller portion. I don't want to gain weight and I don't want to waste food.... but I think this is the perfect spot for guys, I ordered blueberry pancake in smaller portion... damn, when I got it, I was shocked, one dish has 3 large pieces, I didn't even finish one piece. I shared half of the omelet with my sis. It's good. The waitress are very nice with smile on their faces, but we waited too long for our food. We had to keep nagging them for our orders. The people who came in later than us got their order before us. ummm, not so good. The price is good for that big portion. You should try this restaurant if you've never been there. :)"}
{"text":"First time here and I had the Country Fried Steak skillet. It was delicious and more than enough food. Great attentive staff with a positive attitude. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Come hungry, leave happy and satisfied!  When you first walk in you get a down home warm feeling, and the same is reflected in the staff and service. A nice selection of basics breakfast fare as well as quite a few unique combos (Hawaiian and texmex).  Food is never short on flavor and definitely not lacking in size. We have yet to be disappointed in our selection of food. Banana nut muffin is served warm and is absolutely delicious; glad you can get a free one with yelp check in!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Excellent service from. Travis Love the Traditional Eggs Benedict and the Omelets are great too."}
{"text":"Had brunch here and I can't say enough great things! Amy was an excellent server, she was very sweet and attentive. The food was amazing! We had the sunrise mountain, Mexican omelette and the traditional breakfast. The portions are huge and the quality excellent. Kalle also made a great impression on us, he was very friendly and made sure we had a wonderful experience. We will be coming again soon!"}
{"text":"Early birthday breakfast was spent at this place. Rossy was our server and she was outstanding! She was very kid friendly (made life easier) and very attentive. She had a great personality and she took care of my family and I.   My Husband and I ordered chicken fried steak. My all time favorite! The chicken was lightly battered and crispy! So yummy!  Their banana nut muffin is soooo delicious! Btw, check in on Yelp and receive it for free which is even better! Yay! It's so moist and flavorful. It's definitely a must have when going here!  I also love their diablo potatoes! So good! Well seasoned and crispy outside yet soft inside."}
{"text":"It's definitely better than going to Denny's!  There's many locations in Vegas and the staff is always very friendly.  I've ordered most if not  all the different omelet selections on the menu and they're all pretty good.  My favorite is the cheese, avacado with bacon!  SO good.  All their meals have big portions and come with the option of getting seasoned potatoes, which is half the reason I go in the first place.      DON'T MISS: They offer you a banana muffin with most meals, and it's the best I've had in Vegas.  Always fresh and fluffy."}
{"text":"Brunch today with the family. Got seated within 15 minutes during busy hours.  We come here frequently and it feels great that Marc recognized us and came by to say HI, makes us feel really great when people remember us.  Victoria was our server today and she's awesome. Got our drink orders within seconds of sitting down and she put I our food order too.  Our orders had a few tweaks in it, but she was really great about it. She even came back to make sure the orders were correct before the kitchen fired it up.  We love it here!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast and friendly service. The refills kept coming and you can't go wrong with any of their egg dishes."}
{"text":"Had a most enjoyable brunch with friends. I had a western omelette w/fresh fruit on the side , a carafe of coffee was provided for the table. ...Also had a warm banana nut muffin. Prices are reasonable and the food is fresh and so good."}
{"text":"We were supposed to go somewhere else for breakfast but the place closed, we were famished and this was the first place we saw. My friend was trying to avoid having to go to this place and so, I was like \"how can you possibly mess up breakfast food?\" and he was like, \"oh, you'd be surprised!\"   There were a lot of cars parked outside so we thought it was going to be packed and service will be slow. But it wasn't. We got seated right away.  They have sandwiches, pancakes, waffles, omelets, etc. We got 2 different kinds of omelet and a loco moco.  Crazy Chicken Omelet: Julienned chicken, mushrooms, guacamole and cheese. I had mine with egg whites only since I hate egg yolks. Comes with fruit/potatoes, toast/banana nut muffin. I got the yummy banana nut muffin. With a few drops of hot sauce, I was all set. 3.5/5  Loco Moco: This was so messy. Gravy everywhere! Thick beef patty, sunny side egg, gravy and rice. This was alright. 3/5  The service was alright. Nothing fancy, nothing special, no fluff...just breakfast."}
{"text":"Great staff. Clean environment. Tasty food. Fair prices.   Busy place. Unless it is a weekday or there is room at the bar, expect to wait 15-45 minutes. Sundays seem to be the busiest day of the week.   Recommended for anyone who enjoys American breakfast/lunch."}
{"text":"What? I can have prime rib in my eggs benedict? Awesome! Last November (2010), I fell in love with getting breakfast/brunch after coming to this place (I dont care if NPH says guys can't have brunch together!)   I wanted to try one of their omelets, but couldn't pass on the hollandaise sauce... mmm.  This place is GREAT, but the wait was pretty long (40 minutes) on a Sunday afternoon (1pm). It's also pretty far from the strip. We messed up and didn't notice that they had a sister egg works closer to the hotels. If you're staying on the strip, try the Egg and I instead."}
{"text":"My family and I came to try out Egg Works for the first time because my husband found a deal on Groupon. We both used to work for a very well known breakfast chain so our expectations tend to be high. We really enjoyed the food and service at Egg Works. Evan, our server, made the whole experience for us. He brought a muffin out for our children right after taking our order before the food came out. As you can imagine that was a hit for our kids. The food came out hot and fast even with the restaurant at capacity. We will definitely be back and make sure to ask for Evan again."}
{"text":"In my opinion there are much better breakfast places. I find the Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes offered with most breakfasts to be too heavy on seasoning and very dry when all I want is some classic hash browns that I can season myself. Unfortunately that's not an option here. In addition, I ordered two eggs over easy and got what appeared to be poached eggs still dripping with water. If this is their version of over easy then my breakfast was even farther from the classic ones served at so many other places. So, with the above negatives and the fairly high prices I'm afraid I won't return soon."}
{"text":"Great food, and great service from Reina. Had a problem with my original order, and Reina fixed it right away. Thanks again for making my breakfast a great experience."}
{"text":"The service I received today was excellent!! Laura was very attentive and catered to our every need. The food was great. The atmosphere here is great also. Love coming here for breakfast everyone is always nice and the food is always good."}
{"text":"Had wonderful lunch with mom! Our waiter Curtis was AMAZING!  My first time here and he helped me decide on the perfect yummy for my tummy!  The eggsald sandwich was BOMB!  all the veggies were super fresh and the muffins OMG!!!!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best brunch spots I have been too. This place is always pretty busy, but the food is worth it. The banana nut muffins and potatoes are no comparison to other places. I always order the one of the skillets. Fav brunch place in Vegas"}
{"text":"Marc and Jennifer were great. They checked on us frequently and were very friendly. It helped that they were serving awesome food. If you like creamer in your coffee, don't forget to ask for flavored creamer, they'll bring you out a special plate."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE  this Egg Works location! Always get the Huevos Rancheros breakfast - tomatillo salsa.  TO DIE FOR! My daughter got the waffle with fresh blueberries. She ate every bite, sadly I didn't get to try any- scared of getting my fingers bit off. CLEARLY it was good!   Nick was fantastic! Attentive, fun, welcoming and listened to be jabber on about my daughters wedding. We met a local girl from Hawaii \"Blade\" ... another SUPER cool person at this establishment.   Really started our day off right! Thank you for a wonderful breakfast and a great staff.. ;-)"}
{"text":"From the yelling in the kitchen to the mediocre food --- The distinguishing characteristic to me was how this place could have the worst parts of a greasy spoon breakfast joint without any of the homey food quality.  It is a crowded and trendy version of Perkins or Dennys.  Well below even IHOP.  I see its a chain, some might be better, but I kinda doubt it."}
{"text":"came here and had the corned beef hash and eggs.  the banana muffin that it came with was really good.  service was good and the food came out very promptly.  everyone i ate with enjoyed their food and we all ordered different things.  they had a couple big screen tv's with espn on which is a great touch for sports fans.  i would definitely come here again"}
{"text":"We visit Vegas a few times a year and there are breakfast places on the strip that we'll hit up, but they're often crowded and expensive. Egg works is in a really convenient location if you're flying in and the cost is significantly less than what you'd pay on or near the strip.   It's got a typical diner feel. Newspaper style menus with about 50+ items to choose from in all. I got a skillet with bacon, sausage, eggs, potatoes, and cheese for days. The portions are huge and you will NOT go home hungry. My wife ordered some sort of open faced croissant sandwich that came with potatoes on the side. It was sooooo good.   Honestly, the biggest surprise of the whole meal was the banana nut muffin that we got. When you think of a banana nut muffin, it doesn't exactly stir up the same excitement that you'd get for other breakfast food, but let me tell you...these muffins are to die for! They come out warm, so cut it in half and slather that baby in butter and you are in for a treat!   The service was very good despite the restaurant being super packed. We were always getting refills quickly and our food came out right on time. They're really a well-run operation which is just as important to me as the food itself.   Overall, a fantastic experience that is probably more of a hideout for locals than it is for tourists, but it was wonderful. We'll be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my little family. We're always looking for new breakfast spots to try out. Kyla was serving us and she was amazing and fast! Super friendly & helpful as it was our first time here.  Kyla also gave us free muffins! Super good with the butter. The food was overall delicious! Def. Will be coming back again because of the quality and the service!"}
{"text":"We hit Egg Works right after we arrived on a morning flight - a friend lives close by and suggested we meet up there.  We were dying for a decent breakfast before we checked in at our hotel.   Food was FABULOUS - best country gravy I've ever had.  Eggs were done perfectly (I'm a freak about eggs being well scrambled - no runny stuff) and my husband had the excellent corned beef hash.  And yes, the banana nut muffin was delicious.  :)  Will definitely visit again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I'd prefer different flavor or specialty coffees and the muffin is a bit dry , but the service was quick .I would recommend this place for people with a huge appetite. Overall delicious and friendly staff ."}
{"text":"Everything was great. Potatoes are something else. And French toast with blueberries and bacon were on point. Definitely be back. Thanks Reina!"}
{"text":"What's not to like?  Breakfast is the best meal of the day and this place does it right!  I can usually find a coupon for a buy-one-get-one-free meal (up to 8 dollar value) in the weekly View newspaper.  GREAT value.    They have a huge menu with lots of choices, including lunch options (burgers, sandwiches, etc.).  The omelets and a few other meals have the option of either toast or a homemade banana nut muffin and I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't emphasize how freakin' awesome the muffin is!  It's served warm and fresh before your meal comes so if you're starving going into the place choose the muffin to get you started.  Also, the potatoes are perfectly seasoned and totally addicting.  I couldn't leave one tiny morsel behind, even if I wanted to.   The decor is cute and has a country feel.  There is a condiment tray on your table that has a little egg on it to signify if you're OK and don't need your server (black egg that smiles) or if you need something from your server (yellow egg that frowns lol).  Cute touch!   The service was decent - no complaints there.    If you have a coupon and are around for breakfast or lunch then you just can't lose coming here!"}
{"text":"Stuffed French toast is awesome. The server Jodi was amazing and provided great service."}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict were good.  The banana nut muffin was great.  Didn't care for the Diablo potatoes, but blow your carbs on the muffin and you should be fine.  Our waitress, Candice, was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"A pretty good place with plentiful large portions. Homestyle Cooking. Very good service. However nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Awesome service from Ashley....great tasting, large serving portions!! Onolicious...mahalo from honolulu!"}
{"text":"Ok, service was really slow, food ok. Expected better after reading reviews; maybe we just ordered the wrong thing. Had waffle plate with eggs and bacon."}
{"text":"Want a nice, hearty breakfast? The try this place. From breakfast pizza to Cincy chili spaghetti you are sure to find something on the menu you will love. If you are in the mood for a meat lovers omelet, try the three piggy omelet...it is packed with ham, bacon and sausage and it is delicious.   The coffee is amazing and the service is great. If you are coming here on a Saturday or Sunday make sure to expect a wait of up to 30 minutes because the place is ALWAYS packed...a testament of how awesome it is."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast places in Vegas. The service is fantastic! Maria is a very friendly server and she's very helpful. I checked in and got my free banana muffin. The banana muffin is great and comes in a good size. I ordered the Buckaroo from the kids menu. The potatoes are amazing! They are seasoned very well and even though it's not on the menu by itself, it's my favorite food at the place! (Hahah) The eggs are perfect and the bacon is good. I got Toast as a side and the only thing that I didn't like was that they put butter on the toast without asking. I am not a big fan of butter, but they only meant good. They are only open until 3 pm, but until then, the place is very good for breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved to vegas- and this was our first time to egg works! We sat by the bar and within the first 2 mins of being seated we were greeted and asked for our Oder on drinks. And then our server Brady came and took our order. Me being a server myself I was very impressed by how everyone worked as a team here. Quick and friendly service! The fruit they give is a good variety and great portions! Portuguese sausage was amazing! And I loved the potatoes works! Enjoy our time and experience and we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"First time coming here. Won't be the last. There was a little wait to be seat because of the high demand. Our waiter Ashley H mad our visit better with her service. I told her what I wanted and she recommended it. I didn't even look at the menu."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Vegas. A bit of a drive from the strip but worth the trek. The Santa Cruz burrito was fantastic, and our waitress, Donna, was super fast, courteous, and fun. Bravo, Egg Works!"}
{"text":"Egg works is the breakfast place of heaven! Everything you order here taste amazing! The stuffed French toast, unstuffed and the sun rise mountain are definitely my top two go to breakfast meals! The service is great, food is great, what else can you ask for."}
{"text":"**Hours**        - 6am - stop seating at 3pm **Summary**        - Best of Both Worlds - You get the quality control and pricing of chain restaurants with the taste and feel of a family owned joint. This is the fourth in a string of egg works in town and the first that is actually close to me.        - Seasoned Center Cut New York Steak - One of the two items I always get when I'm here. They use their own special seasoning that makes the steak simply delicious.        - Works Potatoes - Seasoned home fried potatoes. Their seasoning is so good they even sell it. Their fries are done the same way.        - Banana Nut Muffin - Comes with almost every dish. It's sinful how moist and addicting this muffin is. If it's your first time and your entree doesn't come with it, I believe they'll give you one anyway. They know it's like crack and it'll keep you coming back.        - Works Burger - The other item I always get. Sauteed onions, mushrooms, bacon, and cheese. Need I say more. It tastes just as good as it sounds.        - Bennies - If you like eggs benedict, they have 5 different kinds. One even is topped with blackend prime rib. **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice breakfast or lunch place."}
{"text":"Good for breakfast,  they have a dog friendly patio, kids liked the mickey mouse pancake, the breakfast potatoes are delightful and the atm5is nice, they have a train that runs along a track through out the restaurant that really entertained the kids"}
{"text":"This place rocks. A shout out to Candace your server here. She's a sweet heart. Of all the franchised stores we've been to here in town I have to say she's the most personal one. Whatever you're paying her pay her more. We'll definitely make the drive out just for her."}
{"text":"The pork chops and eggs was okay the hash browns were average to poor.  Why do I care when i don't like the service from them.  It was average overall, my son likes his place more than I do that is why I come here.  I am bot a breakfast type of person.  They have a loco moco is your looking for something Asian.   My son likes the pancakes here."}
{"text":"A good break breakfast place opened early in the am.  The egg thing probably works better when there are more people in the restaurant.  Our server was okay... I compare them to how I was a server so maybe that is not fair.  She came right away and offered to bring drinks + then she took our order + then she brought the banana muffin + food came much later.  I requested tabasco and our party ate one third of their food before I got it.  I had the crepe carnitas and needed the hot sauce for the potatoes and carnitas.  It would have been nicer to have the food warmer.   She left the check when I still had food and my husband too.  She didn't offer to bring to go boxes I had to ask for them. There a saying to to tip the breakfast server more.  We usually do, in this case she didn't really deserve it.   The food was decent yummy but not more than that.   If there were other places that open early we would be there."}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast!! The food is great and good size portions. You have to try the banana nut muffins/bread, delicious! Chris, our server was the best, very friendly and accommodating. I wish we had a place like this in our area! Thank you, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Best spot to get breakfast in the entire city. They literally have everything breakfast you could imagine. Their omelettes and skillets are like no other. Also, the quality of the ingredients is top. The atmosphere is homey and comfortable. On top of that, service is good too. I would definitely recommend visiting this place every so often."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning and did not have to wait which was a good surprise. I had the HUEVOS RANCHEROS OLE- A flour tortilla layered with refried beans, melted cheese and two eggs any style. Topped with salsa and sour cream. Served with our famous ranch potatoes.   The BF had the CHILI RANCHEROS OLE- A flour tortilla layered with refried beans, eggs, your choice of Works chili or Cincy chili, cheese, salsa and sour cream, served with a side of Works potatoes.  Both were really good but I thought the serving size was small for the price. I love ordering Huevos Rancheros in restaurants. It is always different no matter where I go, but usually good."}
{"text":"This is by far THE BEST place to go for a breakfast joint. It never cease to amaze me how great it is!  I LOVE IT.    Normally, when we come here its generally always packed with a 10 to even a 20 minutes wait time. (of course i wait) because usually it means 5 minutes less than they actually say and I would not go to another place.  If it it means I have to wait, then so be it! HA.  RATINGS (out of 5) 1: lame - 5:amazing!  Service: 4 Food: 5  (I always order the waffle works w/ strawberry & whipped cream, bacon, & egg thats over-medium or sometimes scrambled)  Atmosphere: 3.8  (It is nothing fancy, but it works with the theme they have going on)"}
{"text":"I am a glutton by nature and the way that Egg Works II does breakfast only fuels my sinful constitution. The week before my birthday, I tend to go on a strict diet in preparation for the voracious appetite to come. Out of the blue, the craving for Eggs Benedict manifested, so I succumbed. It was the first time in five years that I have even thought about ordering this dish, so I did my research to find a combination that would best suit my personality.   Egg Works happens to have the veggie works benny with grilled tomatoes, spinach, avocado, and two poached eggs smothered in hollandaise sauce. I almost got this, until I saw the blackened prime rib served on a grilled croissant with sauteed spinach, bell peppers, and eggs covered in the same decadently rich dressing. I could not resist and why should I? The  huge portion was served in a skillet with a a few slices of fresh fruit and home fries. The potatoes are well seasoned and crisp. I started by saying I would only eat half of them and soon the whole side was gone. The eggs benny was delicious, but not without some minor issues. The hollandaise is plentiful and salty, ask for it on the side. The prime rib was cooked to well done and on the tough side. What it has going for it outweighs my complaints. The soft, airy croissant gives a texture that is not often associated with this dish, and I appreciated that. The eggs were poached to perfection. With one swift slash of my fork, the center burst out with all the fatty goodness of the yolk. The paprika on top, cut through the dense creaminess of the sauce.   With my craving subdued, I can go another five years without it and a day without eating. It will take a few hours in the gym to work off this meal, but there is no remorse or regret with this decision."}
{"text":"AMY won my heart with her superb customer service. Brilliant food and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday around 9:30, the parking lot was packed but there were still empty tables to be had inside.  All the staff we encountered were helpful and friendly. We were waited on quickly. We were both in the mood for a Mexican type breakfast so Doug got the Bandito Scramble and I got the Breakfast Tostada with Chicken. We got our free Banana Nut Muffin which was moist and delicious. We didn't have to wait long for food. Doug loved his, devoured it, I didn't taste it but it looked good. Mine was huge, and was more like a breakfast bowl. They used a Crispy tortilla salad bowl, stuck it to the plate with refried beans and stuffed it full of potatoes, eggs, and chicken. The chicken was rather bland so I wish I would've gotten the carnitas instead, otherwise it was good, but I wouldn't get it again.  The menu is huge, so many options, it's hard to decide. I want to go back and try more, plus they have a pet friendly patio!!"}
{"text":"Busy place! Good food delivered quickly despite being full. WIll return."}
{"text":"Do not go to this location. Their food is way over priced and flat out horrible. I got the cheese steak with chicken and it was so dry' and the chicken tortilla soup was so salty I had to down a ton of water. Then when I called to complain they offered me a gc! Nice but why would I come back to a place with horrible food. And service was bad too' I had to go to the back to pick up my own food. I will not return' ..."}
{"text":"This place is Delicious with a capital D . I can be pretty picky when it comes to breakfast but this place does not disappoint . From the service to the food it gets a A+. Had the Chicken Enchilada Omelet , which their potatoes and toast . It was piping hot and melted in my mouth . This is my new favorite place and will recommend this place to everyone . Keep up the great job Eggworks !"}
{"text":"My New Stop once in Vegas!  After seeing the Board of Health reviews of Ellis Island, November 2012, I decided to go to a different stop on my next trip in Vegas. There are two locations for Egg Works. Here goes, the cliffs notes. For breakfast I ordered the Italian skillet with a banana nut muffin, skipped the toast. The skillet was huge! I had my eggs scrambled hard. The were perfect. I can't stand runny eggs. It had potatoes, onions, peppers and sliced Italian sausage with a marinara sauce on the bottom. I would give it a strong 9/10. See the pics.The nut muffin a strong 8.5.  My wife had the corn beef hash. She like it but would like a bark on the hash. She also felt the potatoes were a little large. She loved the muffin. All in all, she gave it a strong 9/10. See Pics.  On our second visit, for lunch, I had the chicken steak sub with onions, peppers an provolone cheese and seasoned fries. The roll was toasted on the grill and buttered. Once again it was a lot of food. My wife had a burger with bacon, mushrooms, onions, cheddar cheese and lettuce. She too, had the seasoned fries. Both would receive a solid 9/10.  The service was great on both visits. They have a system when you require service. You will have no problem finding parking. Just a note, it gets busy very busy on the weekends. We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time ever eating at Egg Works and it was a busy Sunday morning. The bad news - The kitchen missed one of our orders and it took at least an additional 10 mins before the last plate came out. The good news - our server and the manager were super cool and hooked us up with a loaf of the banana nut bread (which is amazingly yum!!) And our son's plate was on the house. They were able to turn my frown upside down with their superb customer service. I had the spinach eggs Benny, and the hollandaise sauce was on point. Big fan of the potatoes for sure! Highly recommend and will be back again soon."}
{"text":"The place was pack wall to wall people, it was easy to carry on a good conversation and we only had to wait less them 10 minutes.   I had the home made Corn-beef Hash and Eggs, it was awesome!    Coffee wads hot and they gave us our own pot of it.    Highly recommend eating at Egg Works!"}
{"text":"Food was great and our server Kat was awesome! Second time here... Wish we lived in the area to come more often :-)"}
{"text":"Good to see another breakfast place in Summerlin. It was a busy Saturday morning and the wait time for 2 was only 2 minutes. The table was still a little dirty so the hostess asked for the bus boy to clean it. Service was professional and quick for us. Our server checked to make sure we were ok at least 3 times which was great. Food was good and so as their coffee. The decorations had funny signs which I thought was refreshing to see. Kudos to the owner for the place and training his people to serve and take care of the customers."}
{"text":"Banging breakfast.  Delicious coffee with premium creamers upon request (French Vanilla or Caramel Macchiato**).  Love love love the caramel.  They have a book of a menu, which you really can't go wrong no matter what you pick.  My favorite is the Carnitas Ranchero.  Bonus points - they have a variety of hot sauce.  Just ask if you don't see it.  It can get a little packed mid morning on weekends.  They have a little egg face that you can flip to notify the wait staff that you need service, and it actually works!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for breakfast.   My first visit I was seated fast, though they were busy.  My server Tina was extremely friendly and went out of her way to make me feel special. She made great suggestions, my drinks were never empty, and I felt like family. I am going to always ask for her when I visit again and again.  The food was fresh and amazing. It felt like moms cooking and I loved it.  The prices are perfect for the tasty amount of food you get.  This is my new favorite breakfast place with a smile :)"}
{"text":"Very clean and the Breakfest is awesome and you can't beat the Price. This is our place to come on Sunday morning. Our server is Lisa T and she is very helpful and courteous   Thank you Lisa T for the wonderful service."}
{"text":"Warning, if you are not prepared for American-sized portions, do not come here. Foreign boyfriend was on continuing American breakfast quest. Next stop: Egg Works. Service was very good, very friendly. This was surprising seeing how busy our server must have been. The place was packed with a line, though we were seated very quickly. Food is typical huge American-style breakfasts. The massive omelets, waffles, pancakes, etc. Wish I had taken a picture of the pancakes as they were literally bigger than the dinner plate. HUGE.   TIP: If you want pancakes (like I did), but want a normal portion, just order the one pancake side order. The short stack has THREE massive pancakes that are impossible to eat.   Also, heads up to dairy-free people: they serve both buckwheat and wheat pancakes which are dairy-free and taste (the wheat does) just like the real thing. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Busy but worth the wait! Air conditioned, and clean the employees are friendly with their customers and amongst each other makes this place for a pleasant and delicious \"eggcellent\" breakfast. Been coming back since I found the place a month ago!"}
{"text":"Tried this place after reading the Yelp reviews of others and wasn't disappointed. They have a small outdoor seating area that I figured I'd take advantage of because in from Seattle and eating outdoors is very rare because of the rain. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. The food arrived quickly and the milk I ordered came nice and very cold. I tried the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet based on one of the pictures I saw on Yelp. The food arrived very quickly and was well presented. Eggs were cooked perfectly for my taste. The meal was very good and was fair for the pricing. The only small complaint I might add was the country potatoes in the skillet were seasoned with some type of seasoning that really overpowered the taste of the meal. For my taste, I would have preferred them without the seasoning and that way you could taste the gravy and chicken fried steak better. However, be that as it may, it was still very good, just not to my taste buds. I will try something different next time. They have a pretty diverse menu selection and there are many other breakfasts and lunch combinations that sound really good from reading the menu. I'd definitely go back and eat here again. Oh!!! Make sure you get one of their Banana Nut Muffins!!!! They are amazing as other Yelpers have mentioned. I'm going to order a second they are so good."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends during our vacation in Vegas, and we agreed that the good was great and fairly priced.   If I could I would have tried everything on their menu. Our server was nice and everything came in accordingly. I ordered the stuffed French toast, very fulfilling and flavorful. Come here on a en empty stomach and leave stuffed! When I go back to Vegas, I will definitely be back. Also their banana nut muffin is amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood Breakfast and lunch place. They have many branches all over Las Vegas area. Their  service is good, food not greasy a pure wholesome place. If you have time try out this restaurant. You will like it."}
{"text":"This place is great. Fast service and delicious food. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait, but its well worth it. Do yourself a favor and this this place out."}
{"text":"This is probably the best breakfast place I've tried. Out of the dozens of times I've been here i always get the muffin and it never disappoints. Make sure to get a muffin loaf for the road.   Plates I've tried:   Chile Relleno omelette, this is a must.   Country fried steak, whoa! Amazing but ask for  gravy on the side   Muffins muffins muffins muffins and more muffins"}
{"text":"Food was way to salty for me. Not good for people with high blood pressure. But they give a lot of food."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience while passing through Las Vegas en route to California. While the restaurant was crowded due to popularity on a Sunday morning, we were seated quickly and given time to explore there extensive menu. The service was great and the food even better, especially the banana bread French toast. Can't wait to return to Vegas so we can stop by again!"}
{"text":"Egg Works is my favorite breakfast spot. Probably come here once or twice a month with wife and kids. They added a train that rides along the top of the wall where the ceiling starts. Both my kids love it. Food is delicious; they have classics as well as some new takes on breakfast dishes. Came here last weekend when my dad was in town and got the smiley chipotle eggs Benedict and it was very good.  Service is always outstanding as well and prices fair. Now that we live on this side of town we will be here much more often!"}
{"text":"John!!!! Was fabulous...  Came in on a busy Saturday got to sit right away and the food came out fast!!!  Go John!!!"}
{"text":"Candice was a funny and attentive server, made us very comfortable and got the good out quick!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came for breakfast at Egg works and had a wonderful first time experience. We were served by Jessica, she was courteous and attentive. The ambiance was calm and relaxing. The food was delicious. I definitely do recommend people to try this place out, you won't be dissatisfied.  Now that we know this restaurant has a dog friendly patio, we are definitely looking forward to coming back along with our furry buddy."}
{"text":"Holy smokes this place is good!!  You can tell that management is doing a good job running this place. The food is amazing with unbelievable prices!!! It's also very clean (including the restrooms)."}
{"text":"Cece is probably the best server that I have seen in a long time. She handled are large party with ease, class, courtesy & a little bit of sass. I would come back here just for her."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior of this quaint eatery fool you.  Inside is warm and inviting with a fun miniature train set that travels around the restaurant.  The food was outstanding and far exceeded my expectations... from the green chili hash, to the veggie omelettes/skillets, you can't go wrong (unless you don't douse everything in their in-house hot sauce)."}
{"text":"Maria our waitress was super. Made a couple of recommendations that were just delicious. We split a mashed potato and bacon omelette and a chicken enchilada omelette. Very very good. I was skeptical of the mashed potato omelette but it turned out to be ta awesome start of my day. Coffee is good, service is lightning fast! Highly, highly recommended.  This app is the best. A total necessity when traveling. In yelp we trust!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy a good hearty breakfast, so eating here makes really good sense. The menu selection is focused on, what else, eggs, so there are numerous omelets to choose from and you can get any style of eggs and the portions are very large and can keep you satisfied for most of the day. They also serve lunch with sandwiches and burgers.   Today I tried the bacon avocado omelet with potatoes and toast . My husband came with me and he wanted to try the carrot cake french toast. this was very delightful and we enjoyed it. He also ordered the tuna melt and it's toasted inside out approach to this sandwich is what makes it unique.   I don't think anyone would be disappointed with the menu or the service. We have been to their Phoenix location as well, and it's this restaurants consistency that we count on to keep us coming back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the omelettes over here, bacon avocado, western, chicken enchilada. Good service, good coffee, and good food is always consistent at egg works."}
{"text":"Service is just as important as the meal. Josh is fantastic. I like eating in a positive environment. Josh was kind, courteous, efficient and positive. I hope management reads the Yelp reviews. Egg Works, you have a great employee."}
{"text":"Very busy during the mornings, but the food and service are great!  They have a large menus with lots of options, so you're not limited to just breakfast."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice. The Hostess blew his nose never washed his hands or use hand santizer. Lipstick on coffee cup. I asked for grandma's biscuits graveyard to go with medium eggs and bacon. Hash browns weren't even lukewarm warm. After waiting ten minutes to place my order than getting it is was running late couldn't get fresh potatoes although they were offered to me. To over season. The biscuits were not Fresh. The gravy was okay. The bacon was okay too. Over priced restraint though!!!!"}
{"text":"Egg works is great, love the food, the service and the quality. Never had a bad experience"}
{"text":"By far the best customer service from any eggworks I've been too and the food feels likes it was cooked right at home!!!! Love the atmosphere"}
{"text":"We actually ordered take out because of the poor service we received the last time.  We ordered the haole Moco and corner beef hash with an extra side of banana muffin.  The hash was a nice serving but it's fresh corner beef not canned....I actually prefer the canned and like when it's done crispy but this was still good! Haole loco looked good (but didn't try).  The banana muffin as always was very moist...yummy! We were overall very satisfied for about $20 and change. I'd recommend take out because their servers aren't very friendly and also not very friendly to kids (under age 5).  Both times we went there they just stuck us in a corner like we were an annoyance.  I must say that there are adults who are just as annoying of not more annoying that kids...so that's that.  Good food....bad servers."}
{"text":"Service sucks here!! Go to BabyStacks or The Griddle! Unfriendly and they never have coffee hot and ready....you always have to wait.  Wouldn't recommend if you have young children either, they seat you far away and treat you like an inconvenience.  Banana Muffins are good, but nothing you couldn't make or buy from any bakery."}
{"text":"My fiance and I decided to visit this restaurant for Sunday Brunch. It was relatively busy at about 9:30 when we went, but the wait was only 15 minutes. They sat us and quickly got our drink orders. We went over the menu before we decided to order, and I decided I just wanted the classic - eggs and hashbrowns (I believe it also comes with a banana nut muffin or toast.) I noticed that adding meat on was an extra $2, so I decided not to get any. But, I was surprised when the waitress then took my order, and asked what kind of meat I wanted. I figured the menu was outdated because I didn't think the waitress would offer me meat that was $2 extra without telling me. My fiance got the stuffed french toast and a coffee.  The food came out and it was amazing! I think the classic says that it comes with two eggs any style, but I felt like I got waaay more than just two eggs. The banana nut muffin was to die for. The bacon, unfortunately, was overcooked and hard to eat. I took one bite and decided not to eat any more of it....that is until we got the check. I noticed that she had charged me for the bacon, which made me upset for two reasons 1) she didn't mention that it was extra and 2) it was completely inedible. (But after I realized 3 pieces of bacon cost me $2, I tried to eat as much as possible...never again.)  I guess maybe it's my fault for not correcting her or assuming she'd mention that it was extra. It was not a big enough mistake to stop me from coming back, it just put a little damper on my day, especially since the bacon was rock hard. Next time I'll just make sure to mention I don't want any sort of meat. Overall, the rest of the food was good and the service was quick."}
{"text":"Consistently good, I get the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet with unseasoned potatoes and Over-Easy eggs. Eggs came out perfectly and gravy was on point. I love that they leave the pitcher of coffee with you so you never need to ask for a refill. I sat at the bar since there wasn't a wait for it and Nicole was my server, she is fabulous. Smiling the whole time on top of all of her section an A+  server (other than being a Cowboys fan). My food came quickly and the order was correct. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is about as good as it gets for Breakfast. They even have a happy or sad face sign at each table to indicate to the servers that you are in need of something. Our server (Lilly) today was great.  Brought a smile to my face as I wasnt feeling too good. She made sure we had everything we needed and checked to see if eveything was good.   The portions are large and they have the Best muffins, fresh fruit and their own hot sauces.  My only complaint would be. They do not accept american express and the girl at the cashier counter really looked like she was going to a Halloween party.  The makeup was hideous to a point it was comical"}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times in the past. My bosses and I would go on Friday mornings for administration breakfast meetI ha. We always sat in the same spot and typically had the same servers. They always remembered what we wanted to drink when we sat down. Breakfast was always delicious, I usually tried to eat something different everytime since we came so often. I was never let down. Nothing was ever bad.   This place has always had great customer service. They are attentive and helpful.   The restaurant is clean. They have a train that travels around on tracks close to the ceiling.  Today I came with friends for lunch. The customer service was great as always. The food again was delicious and I had nothing bad to say about it. I had the Reuben with french fries. My friends has the French toast, the turkey sandwich and fries and the BBQ burger. No one had anything bad to say.   I highly recommend this place, they have never let me down."}
{"text":"While the food was really good, mostly I wanted to write this review because of the staff.  There was a problem during my visit and the staff was very apologetic, and went out of their way to make amends.  This is how a business should be run. i hope they do well for a long time."}
{"text":"Chelsea was the best! She was our server and recommended the best breakfast!!! And she knows how to sell a banana butt muffin!  Haole loco was amazing. 2nd best country gravy I have ever had. And I eat a lot of country gravy!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good on both occasions we've been here and I really liked the chile relleno omelette. Food wise they're a solid 4 stars and in close competition with the Cracked Egg down the street but there's something the Cracked Egg doesn't have...  And that something is none other than Jennifer! The reason for the 5 stars is our favorite waitress Jennifer! She is absolutely, bar none the absolute best waitress we've ever had in Las Vegas!  And if you're reading this we don't know her personally outside of work so don't think it's a biased, BS review. And if her boss is reading this give her a raise as she's fantastic!!! And if Jennifer's reading this Cash said to say hello :)"}
{"text":"Really enjoy a good meal before flights and no exception today. Tried the new bloody mary mix today...spicy!"}
{"text":"Even though there are a few of them, don't think of this place as a \"Chain\".  The staff is very friendly and welcoming, the food is fresh and delish.  Had an omelet and wow was it good.  Asked for some customization on it and it was not a challenge.  NO ISSUES!!!!  Wow.  The pricing is not high, but the quality is.  The only challenge was having to wait a bit for a table, but I guess that is a good thing for them.  We will be back"}
{"text":"I ate here today for the first time, Service, food was great, that's why I've given them five stars.... Not only was the food very tasty/great, The portion size was crazy huge and I pretty, The banana nut muffins were very tasty served with warm butter, that was a first for me, WARM BUTTER, lol ...place was clean staff was friendly and professional in my opinion. I would definitely go back when I'm in town and this will be a favorite place for me to come and eat breakfast and lunch they close early, 3 PM. It's in a strip mall setting so parking is great as well."}
{"text":"I would give the location 5 stars but the guy at the front desk who seats you and takes your checks is a real crappy person. Talk about needing to learn customer service. YIKES if management reads this please either train him or get rid of him!   The server was excellent and my food was wonderful. I love how many options they have for food and will go back. Also, unless you totally love multigrain pancakes, don't order those. They were nasty. However the waitress made it right and got buttermilk instead."}
{"text":"Victoria was awesome! Food quality and quantity were great! We love the service flag system to show if you need assistance.  Great atmosphere in dinning area and low wait time. We will return!"}
{"text":"Holy cow. This place is the place to go for breakfast! Wow they have amazing food!  The service was great! The food came very fast and it's very cheap for how much you get! I will definitely be back there!"}
{"text":"Our waitress, Ashley was fabulous! What a hustler! She never stopped making sure we were taken care of--the table next to us were her regular customers and they raved about her too. Superior service, delicious food, and prompt removal of dishes when we were finished."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! Scott always surprises me with something new. The waitress  Veronica was really nice and she told us about all the entrees and her suggestions were perfect right on it.  If you ever come to Vegas you gotta come check it out! #Now we are ready to eat ."}
{"text":"Used to be my go to spot for breakfast but the last 3 times have been bad to me it's been slowly going down hill from the service to the food just not having the flavor it used to have   I went in today and probably will be my last had to wait 35 minutes for my food only handful of people waitress says it's due to the health department doing a surprise inspection anyways food was luke warm should've sent it back but had to get a start on the day"}
{"text":"This place came so highly recommended and I don't really understand why! The service was great, I'll give them that, and the famous banana nut muffin was decent (not the best though). The potatoes were okay but other than that the food was AWFUL, can only be compared to microwave college cafeteria food. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Sunday around 11:30 AM with a party of six and waited about 25 minutes. Ordered their traditional Benny which was really creamy and we also ordered their home made corn beef hash that came with a banana nut muffin that was so moist and yummy! Love coming here for super cheap breakfast when we're in Vegas! Has never disappointed and we leave super full!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for several months now and the service is really good.  Most of the time I sit at the counter and Victoria is super special.  She always treats me like it is my first time in (although I go several times a week). Its nice to go to a business where they value their regulars:)  #Applause"}
{"text":"First things first: Amanda was an exceptional server. Very funny and engaging, she made us feel welcome immediately.  For this reason alone, I will be back. I haven't ordered yet, and will continue this review after I eat :)  Annnd, I ate. It was really yummy. I had the country benny and at first I was thinking \"theres no way ill finish this..\"  Fast forward about 5 mins, im looking down at a completely clean plate....yep. Im not ashamed. Youll probably do the same thing."}
{"text":"Perry was an amazing server. He was ecstatic,  energetic and most importantly, helpful. The food was great, very filling but in a satisfying way. Would definitely come again, the quality is top notch. We will be coming here more often. Try the fried chicken steak!"}
{"text":"The worst place to eat when in Vegas. Eden was one of the worst servers ever. The cooks could not even cook an over medium egg. Eden came yo our table and let us know that his cooks were getting mad and claimed that they were cooking the eggs correctly. The whites were still runny. The country fried steak was very greasy. They even under cooked the eggs for the traditional benny. I will never come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite Sunday spot.  I have never had a bad experience with the service or food.  I would recommend a skillet or the sundance omlette (yuMmm!)"}
{"text":"The food here is great! The prime rib benny was pretty good. The only thing was that the prime rib was a bit overdone. The banana nut muffin here is extremely moist. Had to order a second one for the road. The thing that impressed me the most was the service. The service here is EXCELLENT! Candice was extremely nice to me and my friend visiting from LA. She was by far the best server i have had in my life! If you guys are lucky enough to have her as your server, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Egg works is great as usual! Used our  $8 coupon from the local newspaper and out total for 2 came out to $13 :) CAITLIN was our server! Cute gal, great service and really friendly. Service was quick and easy. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Jay was our server he was awesome and made our 1st time experience here great!!!!!! Food was delicious...   I got the Chile relleno omelet. Boyfriend got the stuffed french toast we both enjoyed our meals.   Oh! And the banana Nut Muffin so fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Good food, large portions and awesome service. Our server was Donna and she was great. Loved the complimentary banana breads. It was our first time there and we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Perfect place for breakfast or lunch! Service eggceptional!! Always happy after a great meal here! Get any of the eggs benedict!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant no stars I would. I brought my family of 5 for breakfast on my husband's birthday. First, we were incessantly hounded to have our order taken, asked at least 3 separate times in under 5 minutes...and every time they asked my kids were in the bathroom and hadn't even been to the table yet or seen a menu. We definitely felt rushed. Next, I ordered eggs benedict and when it was served the eggs were raw! As in when I cut in to them the whites oozed out like snot, which is disgusting. However the third and final offense came when I flipped my egg over to yellow for service and when I requested some cooked eggs, the waitress proceeded to explain to me that if I wanted my eggs cooked hard I should have ordered them that way. What?! So I said that all I wanted was for them to be poached until the whites were actually cooked...2 more servers asked what the problem was, again alluding to having them cooked over medium or hard. I gave up, asked them to just take my plate and sipped on my coffee while my family ate their food. I most certainly won't patronize this establishment nor recommend it to anyone I know. Shame on you Egg Works staff for bullying and speaking condescendingly towards your customers. We came in for a leisurely breakfast on a Wednesday morning, it's wasn't a packed Saturday brunch rush...you should let your patrons enjoy their experience!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! But super salty gravy and potatoes. I feel dehydrated. But hey. We got right in and bought some of their Bloody Mary mix to try for the new year hang over!!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was great. We had a rather large party of 17 and yet still received great service! They even offered to spit up checks, however, we didn't need that since one person paid for all 17.   Bacon Avocado Omelette was yummy."}
{"text":"I love their skillets and their southwestern salad! Our server Brigette was so nice and friendly. I went with a picky eater and she was so polite despite my friend being annoying!!"}
{"text":"Bruce is seriously the best server ever!  Got my regular 1/2 order of the stuffed French Toast Sausage...he noticed I was wearing a Cleveland shirt and he too is an Ohio guy....great service and killer convection with his patrons and tables...I live on Windmill and Rainbow so I'll certainly be back...."}
{"text":"Get a 1/2 order of the stuffed French Toast extra cheese.... With double potatoes!  Have Ethan be your server!  He's patient, quick, kind and not bad on the eyes .... Had a great quick catch up breakfast this morning with my best gal pal!  The hostess was a sweet heart too... See attached photos ..."}
{"text":"This place has become one of my all-time favorite breakfast joints.  I have been here a few times now and never do they disappoint.   My two favorite dishes are the stuffed french toast (it's basically a french toast sandwich with eggs, cheese, and your choice of bacon, ham, or sausage.) I usually get this with bacon and it is by far amazing. I love sweet and savory dishes equally so this dish is the perfect balance for me.  Second favorite dish is the banana bread french toast (can you tell I love french toast?? lol). But this is by far THE BEST french toast I have EVER TASTED. It's so soft, melt-in-your-mouth delicious. If you're craving something on the sweeter side, this is definitely the dish for you. It will NOT disappoint.   Portions sizes are generous, I usually always have leftovers (which make a great snack for later). The service has always been quick, efficient and friendly, though, I I've seen this place get pretty busy (especially on weekend mornings) so expect to wait a little if you choose to go then.  Their menu is pretty impressive (lots to choose from so I need to start venturing out of my \"comfort zone\" and try other things).   So for all you breakfast lovers out there -- this place is without a doubt a must-try... I can pretty much guarantee there's something for everybody!"}
{"text":"Took my daughter for her 16th birthday. Her favorite meal of the day is breakfast and this place was right on. Delicious food and generous portions. Waitress was a little strange but efficient. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I don't get what all the hype is about this place. Service was fine, but food was not good, especially not for the price.   The weirdness started when we got seated. Our waiter introduced himself, took our drink orders, then left. A few minutes pass and another waiter comes up, introduces himself, and takes our drink orders. No mention is made as to why the first waiter left, etc. For any business to be successful, you have to communicate and manage expectations, and Egg Works failed in this one simple transition of wait staff.   It was our first time (and last), and neither of our two waiters explained the \"egg\" thing (where you have to flip it over to get service). (another failure of communication).   About our actual food, that was sub-par too. I ordered a waffle works with a waffle, sausage patty, and over easy eggs. My mom ordered a spinach benny. I could've made everything at home and it would've tasted better had I made it at home. Eggs had none of that cooked in buttery goodness that you expect at a restaurant, eggs were underdone even for an over easy because there was still that albumin in there. My waffle was the same kind of waffle you'd make at a continental breakfast at a motel (& dare I say it was worse than a motel waffle). And my sausage was not made on site, as they said it was. It tasted and looked like a jimmy dean frozen sausage microwaved for a minute before being put on my plate. My mothers potatoes were reheated out of a frozen bag. The Canadian ham that came with her eggs benedict had a bone in it!! Gross. Our hot sauce bottles were unopened, so I had to rip off the plastic wrapping (this shows that they don't think about the customer experience, just re-stocking the tables without concern as to how it would affect the customer).   Also, it was expensive! Our breakfast for two people was $27! There is absolutely no way I'm coming back."}
{"text":"This is always a go-to for my family, it's right around our area. The place is easily accessible, clean, and has good food. My son and I came here the other day w his aunt, during a weekday is the time to come! Usually during the weekend, the place is packed and rightfully so.   They have a good vanilla cappuccino - I think it's the one that's similar to the ones they have at gas stations, but it's still really good.  The banana nut muffin is so good! So soft and flavorful. It usually comes w the meals, I believe. I always order spam and rice. That's why I love this place - allergic to eggs and don't really like bfast foods, so SPAM it is. They give you two pretty big cuts of spam and really good, soft white rice. It comes w eggs but I always sub it for some fruit.  My son, always orders pancakes from the kids menu. You get a free drink and a huge pancake along w either bacon or sausage - all for under 5 bucks.   I think this is just a great establishment. Nice staff. Good bfast food. We will continue to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place in town to go get Cincinnati Chilli! The staff is friendly, the atmosphere gives off a fun vibe, and the food is incredibly good. The service is spectacular as well, great response time from the staff. It's a shame they don't do dinner or else I would be there all the time."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time eating here and I haven't been disappointed yet.. The food the atmosphere and the staff are so nice!! If it wasn't so far we would definitely brunch here more often.."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good breakfast joint that is worth your money, this is eggs-actly the place to be. We got the Loco Moco and Biscuits and Gravy. The Loco Moco was good enough to bring us back to Like-Like Drive Inn in Oahu but the gravy in the Biscuits & Gravy was a bit salty - thus the 4 stars, instead of 5. Our server, Tanya, was awesome. She was very attentive and also very pleasant!"}
{"text":"Waffle Works w/ bacon.... Delicious.... I'm feelin' like I want to crawl up in the bed right abkut nkw and start my day over..."}
{"text":"Good food, service, and menu. Never disappoints and always a good value. Makes it better when you have a Groupon"}
{"text":"I wish this place was closer!  Probably good its not though  The muffins are the BEST!  I always get an omelet w/everything in it!  LOVE IT!  I do ask for light seasonings on the potatoes or it's a bit overwhelming for me!"}
{"text":"Nice positive atmosphere. My family and I always come here in the mornings for breakfast. Plus, they have crayons and paper games for my little one."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast before we left Vegas. We got here around 9am or so and the line wasn't too terrible. The workers all wore shirts/jerseys representing their favorite football teams, which was awesome.  Server was super friendly, and the atmosphere was very family friendly.  I ordered the chicken fried steak skillet. The menu says skillets come with two over easy eggs, but she said all the menu items can be done with any preparation of eggs, so I subbed in poached eggs. The bottom had delicious potatoes, topped with chicken fried steak, country gravy, and two poached eggs. DELICIOUS!  My boyfriend ordered the prime rib benny. We were honestly expecting slices of prime rib, but they were just small pieces. It was good, regardless.  We could not finish our food though! The server told us that all of the menu items can be ordered as a half-size, so I'll have to do that next time I come!  Overall a great brunch place with great food and great people!"}
{"text":"Saturday Morning came quick this week and boy did I want some breakfast, we decided to turn to yelp to figure out this dilemma and what I found was egg works.. We hopped in the car and headed to this joint. Upon arriving the parking lot was full and this is sometimes a good sign... If you think about it like a fisherman... If you follow all the birds you will find fish. Anyways, we walked in and were sat immediately, Now none of us out of the group had ever been there and the waitress informed us because it was our first time there they throw in free banana nut muffins which happen to be delicious. I then took some time to look over the newspaper... I mean menu and chose the country Benny. How do you go wrong with a biscuit covered in Eggs and country gravy.. Well a coronary is how you go wrong but the food was great. The food came out very fast. The waitress was crazy friendly and on top of all the drinks. I was extremely happy with this choice and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Christian was awesome!  Great service, the BEST food!  We will be back.    I'd consider making him a manager :)"}
{"text":"Food was awesome.   PK, our server, was the bomb!   I will ask for him whenever I come back!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why there was a wait and so many people. My Waffle works was $10. I could pay that anywhere and not have to wait 10-15 mins. The food was okay. Service good. But checkout sucks. You can't pay from the table. You pay as you are exiting. They don't have it where you can enter your own pin so you must show ID unless you're paying with cash. Then you are asked by the cashier if you would like to tip. I find this rude. You can request to have your receipt printed and you can write it down. Cashier wasn't the friendliest either. Don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"The wait in the morning is like any great breakfast spots in most metropolitan areas, with families coming and going. So if you are planning on coming here on a weekend, be patient. We had a group of 20 and we were seated within an hour. Our server was Raul. He was extraordinary! I've never been served food that well! He took our orders and the food was out in minutes. Depending on what you order, the food can be great. Honestly, I couldn't remember what I ordered, everyone else's food around me was way better! My sister's husband got this gumbolaya that blew my mind. The blackened prime rib eggs were delicious. The Michilada was ginormous. The waffle wasn't crispy and that is generally how I like my Belgium waffles. My other sister complained the fruits were not that fresh but I really didn't mind them. My other brother in-law got the country fried steak which was great too! The food is really up to your preference. The house potatoes which resembles hashbrowns were amazing and so were the free banana nut muffin when you check in with yelp. My sisters ordered extra to take home. Great place! I highly recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Food 2; Service 3.5 ... So overall about a 2.75 but I don't round up.  I really LOVE breakfast and honestly, this place simply was a drag. The only thing that I could agree to love was the gravy. The biscuits were \"doughy\" but the gravy masked it. It was simply that good. The other items, eggs, bacon were just meh. The potatoes were the biggest disappointment... just crunchy squares.  Waitress was nice and very attentive. Just wish the food lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday we had a large party and our waitress Maryann was awesome!!! Had a great experience here."}
{"text":"I want this place to be my last meal on earth .   Hands down the best breakfast spot in Vegas . Everything here is amazing . Service is great . Quick , Efficient , and entertaining . Bathrooms are clean . Portion size is very generous . American style breakfast with some Hawaiian style flare . Mention it's your first time and you'll get a banana nut muffin which is to die for . I rarely dream about places that I have ate and and end up dreaming about . This is going to be one of them . This place is a must if you want breakfast . Hablo Diablo everything ."}
{"text":"This is my dad's favorite hang out. The food is delicious. Be aware that you can order 1/2 orders of the omelets. They are still huge at that size! The patio is nice; you can bring your dogs. Pleasant service. Would definitely recommend. My brother eats the breakfast burrito, every time!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but it just didn't impress me. I do appreciate that they serve alcohol, but I prefer caffeine with my breakfast.  I wanted to order a cappuccino, but the waitress told me that it was the really sweet kind that doesn't taste like a cappuccino (aka the sugary liquid that comes out of the cappuccino machines in gas stations). Blech!  I do appreciate the heads up though. My boyfriend and I split a prime rib country potato etc. skillet that they had on special.  The meat in it didn't even remotely resemble prime rib, and all I could taste was the  Worcestershire sauce that they doused the whole skillet with.  :( I would give this place another shot, but with so many awesome breakfast places in the neighborhood...it might be a while before I do."}
{"text":"Great food, decent service, middle of the road prices.  Husband and I have enjoyed different samplings.  Pancakes, omelets, original benny, french toast, etc.  All good!  Kids breakfast meals are limiting.  There is only one pancake option.  It's a mouse pancake with a weird face on it.  No bacon or sausage.  This is a major issue with my ten year old.  He is too cool for the face and wants some meat.  He has ordered lunch or off the adult menu to avoid the mouse pancake.  I tried to talk him into asking the waitress to not make it a mouse and we could add a side of bacon.  Instead our server talked him into an adult meal that he had for breakfast the next day too and I threw away the eggs.  I won't be back with the kids.  Three times now and we just couldn't make it worth it.  I would like to try without kids."}
{"text":"Fully enjoyed my meal.  Met a friend on a Saturday morning there.  I was a little concerned because I know that another Egg Works location would have been completely full at 8:30 a.m.  Thankfully, the Summerlin crowd is late to raise.  I walked in and was immediately seated.  Nice touch to have flavored cream for the regular coffee.  Spinach omelette was perfect.    Generally, I recommend and would go back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Huge omelet that I split with my niece for breakfast with ordered sides of turkey bacon.  All yummy and service was spectacular."}
{"text":"Food is great. Servers are quick, but the hostess, Linda, is probably the rudest person in Las Vegas. If you have the misfortune of dealing with Linda, I feel for you. She has the worst demeanor of anyone I've seen in the service industry in a long time. It's a busy location and small, most of the waiting happens outside, which is not great during \"winter\" months. They can't really accommodate parties of 6+ because of the limited size. The food is great. No complaints. We've tried almost every dish on the menu between Egg Works and Egg & I, so food wise it's worth it. The food came out quickly in spite of how busy the restaurant is on Sunday mornings. Maybe an off morning today, but when the experience is soured before you even sit down, it sets the tone. Maria, our server, did a good job of making our experience egg-ceptional! She really did save this review from being a 2/3 star."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast this morning with family. My sister had an omette, I had Grandma's Biscuits and Gravey and my niece had the Sunrise. Coffee was tasty and plenty of it, food was excellent; tasty, hot and just the right amount. Nicole D, our server, was quick, efficient and fun! We will be back for a great meal at a great price. Egg Works rocks!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was very nice and helpful. It was my friends first time and we enjoyed our breakfast. We LOVED the banana bread, esp when we got a free one for checking in on Yelp! Thank U Yelp!"}
{"text":"This a FANTASTIC breakfast spot. I don't think I can stress just how well cooked everything was. I came here with some friends (this place is definitely fam-friendly) for a quick brunch, expecting the a \"typical\" american breakfast. It was a pleasant surprise to get one of the best egg benedicts I've ever had! For the more daring, the turkey benedict with chipotle hollandaise sauce was also excellent.  Service was friendly and efficient; had out food out within 15min, and dirty plates out in 10. The relaxed atmosphere and cozy vibe invited us to stay longer and enjoy our coffee (it's nice when a carafe is left on the table for all to share). All in all, this is the kind of place that reminds you why breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and possibly can be the most enjoyable."}
{"text":"Brad's Scramble, a banana nut muffin, and a cup of coffee- the perfect breakfast. I don't know how they do it, but every server in this place is incredibly friendly and attentive. I recently picked up takeout and they referred to me by my first name the whole time I was there. The dine-in service is really quick (15 minutes is the longest we've ever waited here). Just one tip- there are often a lot of families here, especially for brunch, so depending on how tolerant you are of crowds and/or toddlers, plan to go at an \"off\" time."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! They offer military discounts and if you check in on yelp, you get a free banana nut muffin too. :-) no wait if you sit by the counter for those who are super hungry or impatient! will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Found this place on accident, and so glad we did! Food was unique and delicious! If we are ever back in the area its a definite stop!"}
{"text":"This is my husband's favorite spot and we go at least once a month. They're always a friendly staff, always fast with the food, and I have never been disappointed. They have everything from basic omelettes and pancakes to experimental takes (like my husband's mainstay - the chili relleno omelette).  Try the muffin - even if you don't like sweets or walnuts. It's PHENOMENAL!"}
{"text":"I come here every Sunday evening! The staff is always super nice and welcoming. The prices are great, and so is their food and coffee!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Seated quickly and our server, Jessica, was quick to get to our table. Ordered the Chile relleno omlette with a side of fruit, and hubs ordered the 3 pigs omlette. Foid was excellent. Potatoes were seasoned and crispy and delicious. The side of fruit was large slices of pineapple, pomelo, cantelop, honey dew melon, orange and waternelon. Food portions are very large.  Excellent food and service for a reasonable price. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast place! Always so friendly and helpful and the food is amazing. I've tried other breakfast restaurants but nothing amounts to Egg Works. They also have great deals in the newspaper and sometimes on groupon!"}
{"text":"Seated right away for Saturday Brunch.  Place was super busy, but we got seated right away.  had the home beef hash.  Was excellent and flavorful.  Server was super friendly.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Egg Works after some fasting blood work, and it was quite possibly one of the worst breakfasts we have ever had due to the poor food quality. I couldn't have been more hungry, but both of our meals were flavorless.  My omelet had a strange burnt oil flavor, though nothing seemed burned.  Apparently, the restaurant uses a liquid butter alternative (translation:  margarine and soybean oil mix) instead of real butter;  this is all I can imagine caused the strange chemical taste on an otherwise uneventful menu choice. There was no real cream for your coffee unless you asked for it (instead they serve a chemical non-dairy creamer), and we were told (when inquired about ingredients) that the potatoes \"come from a bag\" and the waitress couldn't really tell us what was in the seasoning.  I opted for a side of fruit instead.  The food tasted very processed, and gone seem to be the days when \"The Egg and I\" (1st restaurant) used to serve \"homemade\" breakfasts that you actually had to wait for--because they were cooking them--to be served. The speed with which the meals were served at Egg Works also indicated how truly processed these meals are. We ate little, and couldn't stomach taking the food home, though it was offered.  I noticed that tables on both sides of us were also leaving much of their meals.  When we left and saw the U.S. food delivery truck at the back of the restaurant, our suspicions on poor food quality were further confirmed.   Items ordered:  Coffee Hash and eggs Vegetable omelet w/fruit side  We cannot recommend Egg Works based on our experience.  At least consumers need to be aware that this is not \"homemade\" food, nor is it healthy."}
{"text":"Absolutely hate this place, didn't want to even pay the bill, it certainly has gone down hill from last time. Frozen, bottled everything, tap water to drink, go to McDonald's you'll get the same thing for pennies. Yuck!!"}
{"text":"Egg works does it again!  Just got back, my family goes here every couple of weeks.  Food is always amazing, Lisa C was our server again she always does an amazing job.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new breakfast place and Yelp recommended this one. I was impressed with the food and the service. I had the veggie Benny (half order) yes they give you that option! And it was great! My husband had the classic breakfast and I heard no complaints. We were seated right a way and the food came out fast."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy are fantastic!!!  Kat is an excellent server!!!! She deserves a trip to Disney!!!"}
{"text":"We used to buy salt licks for our horses each summer, since salt was not something they naturally came by and needed. I, however, am not in need of a salt lick. But I got one this morning for breakfast.   Potatoes? Completely crusted in the house seasoning, which was at least 75% salt. They glittered in the florescent lighting. Even slightly crunchy...and not because they were fried to a crisp. It was SALT.   Gravy? Lukewarm, but that's okay, I couldn't eat it due to the salt level.   Bacon? Appropriately salty.   I should've taken the leftovers to my horse. I'd never have to buy a salt lick again."}
{"text":"Great, filling omelets !!! Sat down pretty quick on a Sunday morning... Service was nice !"}
{"text":"It's really hard for me to review this place because I got a really bad reaction to some medication I was taking while I was here.  It kind of taints my review.  But I'm going by my husband's reaction to it.    This is the only place where I have seen them serve whole grain pancakes and sugar free syrup.  I should have had egg whites but the whole grain pancakes were calling me so I had the banana pancakes with sugar free syrup.  I liked it a lot, but as I said I got sick and couldn't finish these.  My husband had a croissant griddle that he loved.    I've read how much people love the potatoes here, and I honestly hated them.  My husband felt the same way.  I love just traditional potatoes with salt and pepper with some fresh herbs, but these were riddled with seasoned salt or paprika or something and they were inedible for me.  However, what saves this place are those pancakes and the cheap prices here.  While we don't go out for breakfast hardly at all, when we do, we'll be going back here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for breakfast. The food is always great and our server, LISA was amazing."}
{"text":"Best eggs in town, but we really come for the banana nut muffin. My kids say we should come daily just for the muffin!  The service was friendly and quick. Rosie was so festive and made my children smile with her dancing hat, friendly words and big smile. It was a busy morning and Rosie stayed happy and cheerful to all the guests on the restaurant. If all waitresses were like her this world would be a better place! Thanks."}
{"text":"We have been here before and it's been decent, but today it really wasn't.  My food was tasteless.  My husband's eggs were like plastic and cold.  The only thing that was good were his potatoes habla diablo. Server was nice enough but my husband needed a refill hakf way through, and never got one.  We drove 25 mins to go here specifically and it cost us $30 for some yucky cold food and and empty soda for half our meal. Unhappy."}
{"text":"Omg! I finally got to kill my craving for the Waffle works with Portuguese sausage. Weird combination but I absolutely love it! I love coming here. The banana nut muffin is ahhmazing, so moist light and fluffy!  From the waffle to the scrabbled eggs and portuguese sausage it was definitely cooked to perfection. I couldn't help but do a little dance in my seat while eating lol. The service here is always outstanding! The menu is hugh. Everything looks so good on it. I always have trouble choosing what I want for breakfast. One day I'll try everything on the menu... Will come back again... Hehe"}
{"text":"We ate in the barn. Now you might think we would be ignored, but Ashley was right on it, refills flowed, and service was great and the food is always amazing here. Plus she offered substitutes for the potatoes and offered me a substitute for the bread since I don't eat gluten."}
{"text":"So, we walked in and wanted to walk out because it felt so dark inside. Though, we sat outside and this is a game changer! The food was awesome and the experience was great outside."}
{"text":"After a hard workout on a Saturday morning this is the place to go for a good hearty breakfast. I was tempted to go for the pancakes w/cinnamon butter or the waffles, but decided to be good and split an omelet with my sister. OHH EMM GEE..It was super tasty! Blackened chicken, Artichokes, Feta, Spinach, Mushrooms, and Swiss cheese oh my!! It was simply amazing food. Our waitress was really sweet and although I only could eat about 10 lil pieces of potatoes, they left me extremely satisfied. I would advise anyone who loves breakfast to make a trip, it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"This is one of our goto traditional breakfast spots on the weekends because of the many perks  Pro's.   Check into yelp and get a free banana nut muffin  Extensive menu for breakfast and lunch so whoever is in our group they can always find something  Look on Groupon for a discounted voucher you can purchase  Also check the local newspaper they usually have buy 1 get one 50% off specials    Con's  The service you get can be a hit or miss. Sometimes we will have the most friendly servers and times we will get the basic of the bunch.  That's the only reason I didn't give it a solid 5 stars because there's no consistency.  Also this is not a con, but more of a caution there's a wait on weekends so be prepared.  At least 30 minutes or more depending on the number in your party.   Just don't come here expecting to be seated immediately and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Thanks yelp for my free banana nut muffin !     Seriously I don't think you can go wrong at egg works.   The variety of food can suit anyone's needs, traditional breakfast entrees, skillets, benedicts, pancakes, Mexican dishes, Hawaiian dishes and if you're not a breakfast person they also provide lunch.  Great place to start your day.  Note: This place gets packed quickly, especially on the weekends so I hope you're not in a hurry, but when you're food is good ... It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Veronica was amazing! Great service and awesome sense of humor! We will continue to come back!!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and as always the food was delicious and service was on point. Our waiter Eden was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. He even packed us up some fresh banana nut muffins to go!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast cafés to visit! This morning our server DONNA was very attentive and polite. She immediately noticed there was no creamer left on our table and was quick to bring more for my coffee,she also brought me a new ketchup right away. It's not easy to find great service in a busy place,but I am very pleased with everything here including the food. The chicken enchilada omelet is a fantastic choice! The coffee is amazing & they bring you your own pot to pour from instead of having to wait and hope that you'll get a refill. Next time you're hungry for a hearty meal,this is the spot!"}
{"text":"Rob @ Eggworks was awesome!  Very attentive service, super friendly, brought water and treats for my lil fur babies , and the fried chicken  skillet was sooooo tasty! Thanks Rob! Ohhhh and the michelada is a must order"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place especially after reading all the rave reviews. Asked the server what she recommends and she said the skillets were popular. I ordered the chicken, mushroom and spinach skillet and I felt that it had been fried in an oven. I couldn't even eat the potatoes underneath the eggs and toppings. My friend and I also shared an order Of pancakes which were large an tasted pretty good but the syrup tasted fake and commercial. My bill was $15 after splitting and it was a waste of my money... Wish I knew what people were raving about on here but unfortunately I won't be back to find out.."}
{"text":"Veggie Benny is delicious.  Coffee is great, will be back.. Jeny was great.. You really should try this place.."}
{"text":"Went back for a second time while visiting family, and this time around I was quite pleased. Food was great, restaurant was cleaner and staff seemed happier.   I'll he back for sure"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for work and this place was just up the street.  Pretty crowded with what seemed like some pretty frequent locals, so it must be good huh??  yes, the service was quick and the food was very good.  I had the corn beef hash and loved it....  hopefully I will be back."}
{"text":"Egg works?? Well they do if they are made right and this place does it right every time. I am not going to lie, I am a chain breakfast kind of girl liking place like IHop and McDonalds (I know, guilty as charged)  I knew I had found a good place when I walked in and the place was packed! I mean, packed...but no one seemed stressed out to wait. Hmmm...place that is worth the wait, I'll wait! We were seated very quickly however and greeted immediately. The service was fast and friendly and the food was great. I had the eggs benedict and it was soooo yummy.   They even have a cute egg on the table that you can indicate if you need help or not...CUTE!  Overall a great find for breakfast...and I heard they make a mean burger too so I will have to come back. Egg works......It does for me :)"}
{"text":"I used to go to other breakfast places...not anymore. Once you've had something at Eggworks, no other breakfast will do...but it's not just the food...the service; from busboys, to servers, to managers, it just doesn't get any better...always a smile and a hello, my iced-tea is constantly filled (even while I'm not looking)...sometimes you DO want to go where everybody knows your name. You can't go wrong with ANY of the servers, but yesterday it was Divina (yes, like Divine, only better), who made sure everything was perfect about my order, including the toast !  Everything should run (ad taste) like Eggworks...great job everybody."}
{"text":"server donna was great got our food quick and as always the chicken enchalada omlette was the best!~!!!"}
{"text":"Hanging out in Las Vegas we came across this cool place for breakfast.  With an atmosphere that reminds me of Cracker Barrel and a similar staff. They were friendly and I had a good expectation for decent food.   We weren't disappointed. I had \"Traditional Benny\" (Eggs Benedict) and my wife had a cheese omelette with bacon sans carbs.  The side of potatoes was unique and tasty!  Both meals were very good and the bill came to $29 including tip.   Coffee was served to our table with a carafe which was nice.   A decent place for two or a family. A bit pricey for breakfast but worth it."}
{"text":"Service was decent, coffee carafe instead of refills etc. Only reason for only 3 stars, I asked server if they served blueberry pancakes with blueberry syrup, he says that they serve with compote. When my food came only one small container of compote as well as maple syrup with my blueberry pancakes.  I would have asked for more but no more server until he brought the bill. My daughter really liked her food.  Restaurant was clean and orderly, not overly crowded, generally a nice place. Only improvement I would recommend maple syrup with blueberry pancakes is nasty... invest in a couple of bottles of blueberry syrup."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend about a month ago and it was so delicious.  I love all of the different omelette options.    Because i LOVE salt and i don't eat meat (not unless it is suspicious meat) i ordered spam and rice.  Yum.  how do you go wrong?  i just love that they offer spam!!    My friend ordered the chile relleno omelette.  I didn't even know that such a masterpiece existed.  It was savory, cheesey, and had a yummy kick that only a chile rellano can deliver.    I'd love to go here again in the future... though i'm always in Vegas, not sure when the next time i'll venture \"off-strip\"."}
{"text":"Very great breakfast , service was great their seasoned potatoes are sensational . The wait staff is also very friendly ! I do come in from time to time before church I will definitely be coming back ."}
{"text":"Dropped in for breakfast before leaving Las Vegas to head home for LA. Plenty of parking, clean yet well loved interior, friendly and attentive staff, impressive menu, and loved the free banana nut muffin we got with yelp check - in! Freshly warm, super moist and fluffy. We woke up a bit late so had to wait 20 minutes to be seated on a Sunday, 1130am, for group of 4. Crazy busy so food took a while to come out, but we were fed well with hearty portions. One of our orders' eggs were wrong, but servers were efficient and quick to fix all our needs.  One of my reason for 4 stars: water tasted like tap, just a bit of personal pet peeve. Yuck. Encourages ordering drinks from menu, yes, but I don't like anything else, so I guess I'm just picky. Easy fix: perhaps get one of their juices by carafe, or get their bottled water (noticed this on menu after we left)   1. Omelet stuffed French toast with their signature potatoes: for those who want both sweet and savory, dry crunch and moist fluff. French toast was dipped in maple syrup with one bite, hot sauce with next bite. Well done, egg works!!  2. Chicken mushroom spinach skillet, eggs over easy, with banana nut muffin: no complaints when melted cheese stretches 8 inches long! Nom nom all around, banana nut muffin was preciously kept intact to take home (since we gobbled up the freebie muffin)   3. Works veggie Benny, ordered spinach sautéed, side of fresh fruits : average but solid hollandaise sauce. Beautifully complimentary flavors of grilled tomatoes, cooked spinach, avocado, poached eggs, and creamy sauce. Full and rich, this is a hidden gem that may be  overlooked because it's a veggie dish. Fruits were edible and sweet, unlike most places where they seem to just be hard plastic  decorations. Nice variety of watermelon, orange, pineapple, two melons and grapefruit. You won my heart!   4. Corn beef hash on skillet, eggs scrambled with toast and their signature potatoes: good flavors, we expected a portion of the hash grilled so a bit disappointed it was all moist. Enjoyed with their variety of hot sauces."}
{"text":"Great service and a fun atmosphere! Really affordable, good for a family brunch or a lunch date with friends. They do have vegetarian options as well! Traditional Benedict is what I alway recommend!"}
{"text":"Egg Works they live up to there name for sure. I came in went straight to the bar and had service instantly. Our waitress name was Heather and she was very helpful and awesome. I ordered the Stuffed French Toast food was delivered within 10 minutes and served hot. The stuffed French Toast was a good size quantity and just really good all around. Food was good, service was good, and atmosphere is good. I will be back"}
{"text":"In my quest to support local businesses, we checked out Egg Works this morning. SInce it was after 10 on a Sunday morning, I figured it would be crowded and it was. We only waited about 10 minutes. That was a shock. Our server was Kim and she was outstanding. The food was OK. I had regular pancakes, eggs over medium, and bacon. She asked if I wanted the bacon crisp and it was (crispy and good). The eggs were runnier than I wanted (maybe my fault for not asking for over hard). I am a pancake lover and the pancakes were some of the worst that I've had a restaurant. I didn't like the taste of the batter and they were too heavy and doughy. My partner tried them and liked them. He had waffles, ham and scrambled. He didn't like his waffle and neither did I. Something about the batter. ANYWAY...The place is called Egg Works...I will go back. I liked the atmosphere. I really enjoyed the employees. They were all very nice, helpful, and funny. Next time, I will focus on an egg dish which I'm sure will be very good. Oh...we did order a banana nut muffin because so many Yelp reviewers talked about it. It was definitely delicious and I'll stick to that next time. There will be a next time..."}
{"text":"Came to have breakfast with my mom and we both ordered a omelet.  The breakfast potatoes that were served with the omelet were delicious.  I don't even know how to explain it.  The seasoning on those potatoes were BOMB!  Server was very friendly and nice. The coffee refills saved me because it was so early. I would definitely go back to Egg Works when I am craving a good breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Waiting: Went in at 12:00pm on a Friday. No wait. Seated right away.  Food (Vegan): Ordered The veggie skillet without eggs and cheese. Added tofu and potatoes. Side of toast without butter and an extra side of avocado. Delicious! The potatoes are soo good. Whole meal was super filling. Last time I came here, they got my order wrong and service was slow and terrible. Glad it was better this time!  Service: Came with a party of 22. Excellent service this time and food come out pretty quickly. Waiters were attentive and fast.  Convenient, delicious, and would come again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! first time visitors get a free banana nut muffin and it's so warm and soft. My wife ordered the stuffed French Toast which also comes with a side of potatoes.  Her plate was huge and of course wasn't able to finish it. I had the Country fried skillet, I almost wished I would've gotten a half portion but didn't know it was an option until I overhead another waitress mention it. it was definitely amazing though.  I added the red hot sauce that is on every table and Daaaaaamn.... Excuse my gangsta but THAT SHIT WAS AMAZING!!! Definitely will come by next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"First time visit and the food was terrific as was the service.  I had the Chile Renellos omelette.  The spices  and amount of sauce were perfect.  The pepper was not over cooked.  I had the beans and rice and they were just as one would expect from a Mexican cuisine.  My spouse order CinnciChili 5 way and he was able to recapture his childhood through a meal.  My niece ordered a burger and fries.  The fries are seasoned deliciously and the burger was juicy.  My sister had strawberry stuffed French toast.  Wow!  Unbelievably beautiful and sumptuous. I can highly recommend this place.  If you want an egg dish they got it and more."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Egg Works. Great food and phenomenal service from Evan our server! I am a VP of a major chain hotel and customer service is extremely important and I was beyond impressed with the service. You get a large amount for the price.They even have an outdoor seating area for you and your pet!  I would highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"It was a good hearty place for breakfast. Nothing earth shattering on the menu and no gluten free bread but that's ok. The eggs were cooked well and the bacon was crisp just the way I like it. The kids loved this breakfast of french toast for my younger one and a french dip for my teenager. :). The best part of the meal was the service. Hector was super. He was warm and friendly, fast to bring us drinks and get our orders. He gave great advice and followed up well. We felt like we were well attended without being nagged which is a hard thing to do and we really appreciated his great service. Definitely recommend for a solid, yummy breakfast with good service."}
{"text":"Great first experience here today! Was welcomed by Tina with homemade muffins and great service. Will definitely swing by again to try the buffalo chicken pizza!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, happy M.L.K. day!  The wifey decided to take advantage of a Groupon deal to kick off baby's holiday outing.  ...see what I did there...cross network marketing baby lol.  Last time I was here I suckered my self into getting the Prime Rib Benny, little did I know that the PR was niblets, what do I look like a child?  Real men eat fast slabs of rare+ PR, not scraps.   Never again.   This time I decided to try something...classic,  chicken fried steak it iz.  Of course nothing beats Rise and Shine's CFS and that Country Cafe place in Mountain's Edge ain't half bad as well.  Mr. Mama's was aight or shop I thought, it's actually leaps and bounds over Egg Works sadly.  Again wroth the damn niblets!  Not only that, it was way over cooked and got me thinking that it was not made to order and most likely pre-prepped, boo!    The wifey had the Works Crepe which was way better than what I got,  had we paid full price and not used the Groupon, I just might be cussing as you read this.  I love me some breakfast around the clock,  especially the simple dishes.  I think from here on I will stick to what I know and only go worth the fail safe items here from now on.   Unlimited poor your own coffee simplified things without having to hunt anyone down and can't go wrong with marmalade on toast, otherwise,  pretty mediocre of you ask me and can make something better at the casa."}
{"text":"There aren't many choices for a good breakfast around Anthem and the opening of this Egg Works location wont change that.  This EW is new so it doesn't have the old feel of the Sunset location but the food is average at best.  The service reminds me of a factory and the server was about as enthused as a factory worker.  When you factor in the price of various menu items; I don't  foresee returning any time soon.  I am happy to continue on down Eastern Ave. to Sunrise Cafe."}
{"text":"I was in the area after an oil change and wanted eggs bacon and potatoes.    I yelped and found EGG Works.  Walked in was seated in Lisa's section.    Received my free banana, but muffin from yelp.   Ordered OJ, the classic, scrambled eggs, potato's toast and bacon.    My service was fabulous, even though it was extremely busy my server Lisa was very attentive and made sure my first experience at EGG Works was worth coming back   The banana muffin was not very banana based. It did come out warm and moist.   It was very good tasting, but not a banana based muffin.   So my breakfast came out fast and hot.   The eggs, and bacon were good and fresh.  The Potatoes have a good kick to them.  If you do not like spicy, order light or no seasoning.    The restaurant was clean and orderly.    They have a good section for big parties in the back."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Daniele did a great job, very friendly, got the hash and eggs and everything came out perfect ! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always great food and great service! They give you an entire carafe of coffee which is so great because you are in control of heating your own cup! There is a fantastic menu and we have never had anything that wasn't great! We eat here at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was great!!! Our server MANNY was awesome! He let us sample their banana muffin, which was so delicious.  My husband doesn't like banana bread and he ended up eating the whole muffin! Manny was prompt and knowledgeable. The food and service was great. Will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"this was our first time at Egg Works - we had a great experience and our server Nicole - made it extra nice - she was very informative and made some great suggestions - we ordered extra food for the next day, and she told us about what other things we can get with our meal if we wanted to substitute... She was super nice.    - in fact we thought she was the owner...  Thank you for making our experience very nice.  Regards,  Rosie and Dori and Pat"}
{"text":"We love this place and come here every few months. Today when we came there was a slight change in the menu and the staff informed me it was not a change even though i had ordered this several times in the past. I still love the food here and will continue to come back for their banana nut muffins, they are killer."}
{"text":"Service was amazing, let's start with that. Our waitress was Twila and she was a very lovely lady.   We came here for breakfast after doing some shopping in the area and saw we had a free banana muffin coupon available so we decided to give it a shot.   The ambiance is so homey and very much reminded me of some of my favorite spots back in northern cali.   My friend decided on the Santa Fe wrap, while i decided on biscuits and gravy with a side of toast (because it came with eggs and you can't eat eggs without toast!). Our portions were HUGE. I think we were a little shocked when our plates came out. I had one of 2 eggs, 1 of 2 biscuits, 2/4 pieces of toast and 1 of 2 pieces of bacon. Just writing this review is making my mouth water because the biscuits and gravy were so delightful.   My friend didn't get breakfast, but his wrap was amazing! I don't even remember what was inside of it but it was like a caesar salad with additional seasoning. It was perfectly savory, but since it was a cold wrap it almost felt refreshing to be eating.   It was pretty busy when we arrived and we ended up parking in the lot next to this place, but the walk was nothing. There's parking all around and it's busy during obvious peak breakfast hours, but the food was worth it and the service was quick. Definitely glad we came here!"}
{"text":"Donna is THE BEST!! First time in and the food and service were great!! Veggie omelet and banana muffin was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Egg works has always been one of my favorite restaurants, but at times it can get pretty busy. We had an excellent server, Jennifer, whom provided quick and excellent service, even in a busy restaurant. Food was amazing as always, and I'll forever love coming here. Thanks Jennifer."}
{"text":"First time here for me. I got the country fried steak and my fiancé got the pork carnitas which was highly recommended by our server Candice. Everything from the moment we walked into the door till we walked out was amazing and delicious. Besides the awesome food we also had an awesome server. Candice you the best.!!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious especially their signature potatoes that come with your meal. Nicole is the best server!! She makes you want to come back and request her personally."}
{"text":"A great little place. My son and I came to try it from a groupon I bought. I had the chili omelette with the works chili. It was very tasty and the portion was huge. The works potatoes are very good. They have like a Cajun seasoning to them. My son got the mouse pancake with chocolate chips. He got the sausage patty. Our server Christian was awesome. It was hard to decide if the food or the service was better. I definitely recommend and if u can score the groupon even better. Next time I'm in Vegas, I will definitely come here."}
{"text":"First time eating here and everything was so freakin delicious!! I have the Denver omelette. my husband had the biscuits & gravy. We also tried something new, the gumbalaya!! I definitely recommend trying the gumbalaya!! Your mind will be blown!! Will definitely need eating here again!! Thank you, Alexa for being so amazing and helpful!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in Las Vegas.... Every time I come to Vegas I have to eat at egg works. Erika was the best server"}
{"text":"Love the food and service. Always friendly staff members and front desk. Food portions are good and enough food prices are reasonable and good to share. Lots of locations throughout Las Vegas my favorite location is in summerlin."}
{"text":"Great place to eat Great service Great staff Great management  Islanders from the 808 Hell yeah...real friendly"}
{"text":"The 5th Egg Works location has opened up in Summerlin in the Trails, off of Village Center Drive and Town Center.  The location of the former Maru Korean BBQ restaurant, the site has been transformed into one with ample seating.  I arrived this Saturday morning around 10:30am expecting to wait since the parking lot was packed.  However, my friend was already seated, which was a good thing since we were both starving.  Our waitress, Nohemi, was very friendly and attentive.  As with the other Egg Works restaurants, their menu comes in newspaper format and you'll find the same crepes, omelets, pancakes, waffles, and scrambles.  I was craving pancakes, but also just wanted eggs and bacon, but that simple combo is not available, for some odd reason.  I ended up ordering the Blueberry and Cashew pancake short stack, which is three smaller pancakes (you can also get one huge pancake instead of the short stack), a side of turkey bacon (3 strips), and a side of 2 egg whites.  My friend got the huevos rancheros, which came with breakfast potatoes.  Our food came out in a timely manner considering the place was packed and it's brand new.  For a \"short stack,\" the pancakes were bigger than I expected them to be so I ended up eating only half of them.  Blueberry and cashews together sounded interesting, but I didn't love it; I would probably order a different kind the next time around.  I don't remember what the side order of eggs cost, but the turkey bacon was $3.50.  My meal came to about $14, which is more than I like to spend for what I had, so I don't think I'll be coming here too often.  However, this place is definitely going to give the neighboring restaurants that have been serving the breakfast crowd here a run for their money."}
{"text":"We met some friends here for Sunday brunch around 10:30 and the place was packed to the gills!  We waited about 20 minutes for a party of four, which I suppose isn't too bad for that time of day.  There were people waiting to be seated the whole time we were there; business is good at Egg Works!  This is a local chain and a decent option to go for eggs, omelettes, pancakes, waffles, as well as chili; yes, they have Cincy Chili on the menu.  Unfortunately, I didn't have anything too exciting except a 6 egg-white omelette with mushrooms and spinach and three slices of limp turkey bacon.  It was okay, but if I have the choice for breakfast, this isn't my first one.  If you go on the weekends like we did, just be ready to wait a bit. Open until 3:00pm."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday morning during prime breakfast time.  The restaurant was busy, but the wait wasn't bad and we were seated 5 minutes sooner than expected.  The service was quick and friendly and the food was delicious.  I ordered a Country Benny and I are way more than I normally do.  Overall, a very positive experience and the food hit the spot."}
{"text":"The corned beef hash here is to die for. Homemade and delicious!! Best hash I've ever had and I love hash.   Service was mediocre but the breakfast stole the show. I think when they give you the coffee pot that they don't check back as often as they need to because you don't really need the refills. Doesn't mean you don't want to add more eggs to your plate."}
{"text":"The day was slow and our server was very attentive.  She was super friendly and I will be back she deserves a trip to Disney...thanks Twila u were great"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast in vegas. They have three different chefs. One for potatoes, one for pastries, and one for eggs. Everything is delicious. It is the sister to Egg and I. They have mimosas too!"}
{"text":"The food was great- we enjoy our meals here. Portions are a generous size, prices are even better! Our server CHRISTOPHER was also very attentive. We'll be returning for sure."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots.... The works chili is amazing. Anything with it on it and you won't be sorry. I've had the omelette, skillet, and burger with chili and can't decide which one is the best. Those are usually my go-to choices, but I've tried many things before finding my favorites. All of their breakfast food is amazing and the habla diablo potatoes are a can't miss item. Not a big pancake/waffle person, but theirs seem pretty good to me, as I've tried a bite of other's food. It can't get pretty packed on the weekends, but you usually don't end up waiting very long for your food once you've sat down, which is surprising. The only real downside is the wait to be seated on the weekends if you're not willing to sit at the counter (which looks like it's pretty uncomfortable to be smashed in if you're not a smaller person like I am) and also the wait to pay. I wish you could just leave the money on the table because it can get pretty backed up trying to pay. If you're coming in at a time that isn't during their peak hours (weekend mornings I'm assuming) then everything should be smooth sailing. Their prices are okay, just average, but every couple months a Groupon pops up and I grab the maximum amount of them because it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast. John was our server and he did a great job! Not only did we get a great breakfast, but we had some great conversation as well.  The Denver omelet, bacon and avocado omelet, and eggs Benedict all get a great review."}
{"text":"If you're new to Vegas, a tourist, or just simply a local looking for a new breakfast spot that is always consistent with quality, customer service, and portions!  Vegas has many places to eat especially for breakfast but as a local tgeres only a couple that actually keep me coming back weekly. The Egg & I/ Egg Works family is hands down my go to becuase of tge overall satisfaction of service and food quality.   When you first walk in you are welcomed with a very \"home cooked\" feel. Its a quaint little restaurant that is there to please. Everytime in everyway this place delivers!   In 2 simple words:  JUST GO!   P.s. check in on yelp and GET THE MUFFIN! Your welcome!"}
{"text":"Great service with the help of Robert who was very informative and attentive,  welcomed us with great service and made sure our experience was awesome. Thanks again Robert. Great atmosphere, food quality is awesome. Free wifi. I got the spinach Benny and the portion is amazing. Presentation is on point and it taste amazing. I recommend this to anyone. They now serve lunch so I will have to try that out soon. The food comes quick and fresh when you order. Received my order within 15 min. And had a party of 7. Great place. And a definite must try! Pruces are perfectly reasonable too. Always will be back for more."}
{"text":"Diane our waitress and she was amazing. The food came out quickly and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out after seeing images of their breakfast potatoes on yelp. They looked so crunchy, savory, and delicious! We drove about 9 miles off the strip to eat here and unfortunately the experience was just okay.   The environment is very homey...and old timey with a farm mural all over the walls and a \"general store\" by the entrance. Their eggs were cooked really well I'll give them that! I ordered a skillet and I really wish I hadn't. My skillet cane with potatoes, chilies, a hugeeeeee amount of cheese, and the over medium eggs on top. Sounds good right? Might have been good if it wasn't totally and completely smothered in their house salsa of which I wasn't a fan. This made the potatoes have no crunch, the cheese was overkill, the salsa was subpar and not spicy at all, and I basically only enjoyed the eggs.  Service was fine. We were able to order quickly and were checked up on. When we went to the register to pay we were ignored for a couple minutes while the two working at the register were chatting nonstop.   I definitely would consider coming here again because maybe I just didn't get the right thing. This place definitely seems to be doing something right to draw such a crowd."}
{"text":"Still amazingly delicious!  Just ate at the Sunset/Eastern location in Henderson - Donna was our server, and the food and service was impeccable as always! Thanks Egg Works!"}
{"text":"I have to say this was a great visit!! Angelo our waiter was super friendly, was patient and explained everything.    Your first visit you get a free banana nut muffin.    The place appeared very clean the only thing that bothered me was seeing the wait staff not wash hands before throwing bread in toaster and I actually saw one female pick her teeth and then touch food.   I didn't get toast just because of that incident.   I'm glad the waiter and food was a fantastic experience because when paying the cashier she was short with us and rude.   This won't stop us from coming back, maybe she was having a bad day!! If not hope She can find a happier place within"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Had the country fried steak with the side of toast  will be coming back again"}
{"text":"My gosh, eggs on eggs on eggs! I highly recommend the biscuits and gravy though to add as a side. Their fries are surprisingly great too. Actually, all of their fried goodness is pretty spot on.  I'd definitely come back and the servers recommend some pretty great items too."}
{"text":"Ordered 4-egg Veggie Omelet + cottage cheese + banana-nut muffin. Since I'm more of a 2-egg omelet guy I looked for that but 4-egg is it for all omelets.  I glanced at the tables next to me and plates piled high were being served. No wonder Americans are overweight. Whatever happened to petite meals of good quality and that taste good?  First to arrive was a chocolate-colored muffin, I said 'I ordered banana nut', waitress said 'it is'. Sure enough it was and it was the best banana-nut muffin I've ever had.  Shortly the omelet arrived with a large, 1-cup serving of cottage cheese (and a soup spoon to eat it). The veggie omelet was covered with two types of cheese which didn't add to the taste so I scraped it off. The omelet was excessively oily; too oily for my taste. That's why I have given it two stars.  Final bill was $14 which I consider overpriced for the quality of the food I was served."}
{"text":"Should be named MSG works. I ordered corned beef hash and my boyfriend ordered eggs benny. The corned beef and the potatoes should come with a health warning because of the amount salt they put in it. His poached eggs were over cooked and covered in a ridiculous amount of cold salty hollandaise sauce. When we brought it to our servers attention she asked if it was our first time and then informed us that we can ask for easy seasoning and that she should've let us know. It was a very disappointing experience"}
{"text":"I love this Eggworks location! The staff is always friendly and helpful even when it's not 'their table' if you use the Epoxy app you can get a free breakfast/lunch. Kid friendly and overall a nice environment for all. We're here at least once a month -highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Definitely found a new favorite. Food is absolutely delicious, the menu is extensive which can be a bit overwhelming, but everything tastes good so i guess thats ok. We go alone and with our two small children and we always have a good experience. Best day to go is Sunday mornings because everyone is at church, otherwise you'd better be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Great food and over the top service,  Luana's service was above and beyond!! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow, I was utterly surprised and glad I've tried this place. Probably one of the best breakfast places I've ever had. I'm just a little upset that I have to travel 300+ miles to go to this place. I wish this came make this place or something similar to it here in the bay.  If I'm not mistaken I ordered \"This Little Piggy\" breakfast skillet. Which contained a combination of crisp bacon, diced ham, pork sausage, and bubbling cheeses. And yes it just as mouth watering as it sounds. What I did like most was their seasoned potatoes that came with my meal. Can't believe there are no other similar places like this around the bay. I simply fell in love with their breakfast there. You better believe this spot will be a must stop every time I come to Vegas. I can go on an on about this place buy I'll save some thoughts for an update review when I come back trying another meal.  Next update will be on a new meal, service and environment (this place has a shizzzz load of flat screens). Thanks for breakfast Egg Works, I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Love love love their banana walnut muffin!!! Soooo good, fresh and warm when they serve it.... their food are good and huge portions, service is fast and we had an awesome server (sorry im poor in remembering name).... we will be back definitely!"}
{"text":"Went here on 08/17/14 with my 3 siblings for breakfast. While I've lived close to this location for the good part of a year, I haven't stopped in until now, because I know that they're a little on the pricy side.  I had the California Crepe: \"Diced bacon, sliced mushrooms, diced tomatoes, guacomole and Swiss cheese. It is served with a side of Hollandaise sauce.\" Hollandaise sauce was great, the crepe was REALLY stuffed full and I enjoyed it. It came with a banana muffin and home fries.  My sister had The Classic: \"Two eggs cooked any style with Works potatoes\" with toast. She ate about half of the plate and had the rest to go.  My brother had the blueberry pancake and our waitress, Nancy, upsold us on adding eggs and bacon so his meal came out to more than $9. My brother said his pancake tasted rubbery and that the eggs made his stomach hurt. Once he got home he said his head was hurting and ended up going to be bed early. I think he had a reaction to the blueberry sauce - I'm assuming it has corn syrup in it, which bothers him.   My youngest sister had the kid's meal mouse pancake and she ate about half.  While it seems like my meal was by far the best and our waitress was great, our breakfast for 2 kids and 2 adults came out to $46 with tip. Yikes! Not sure it was worth that price."}
{"text":"I don't know how the food is because we were waiting for over 20 minutes (we timed it at one point) and received no service. What makes it worse is that at least 3 waiters walked right past us, made eye contact and kept it moving. We didn't even get asked what we wanted to drink...   We eat at restaurants probably about 8-10 times a week and I can honestly say I've never seen something like this happen before. Its unacceptable and really disappointing since The location was so convenient.  Anyways, we made the drives to the Egg Works on Eastern and Sunridge heights and the service so far is amazing we have drink already and its been less than 5 minutes. The sunset location should be ashamed."}
{"text":"I love Egg Works. I always get the Huevos Rancheros because it's the best I have ever eaten anywhere. I get mine with added avocado and it really adds to it. I'm really happy they have a frequent flyer card (Epoxy app) because I eat here all the time. I get people addicted to this place on their first time."}
{"text":"Our go too breakfast place! Make sure to check in on YELP to get their amazing banana bread muffin. We've been to several of there locations and they are very consistent on the taste of their food. Since, we've been to Egg Works so many times we have pretty much tried everything on their breakfast menu. I can't really think anything that we did not like. You can't really go wrong with anything you'll order, one think you have to make sure is to order the diablo potato instead of hash browns. It's really super good...I can have them for snacks."}
{"text":"Blackened Prime Rib Benny!  https://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/photo/ntBG6Umktvb2GX3HtRrKjw/l.jpg  Imagine a creative twist on your standard eggs benedict, then turn it up a notch. What you get is the Blackened Prime Rib Benny. It's made up of a grilled croissant with chopped, blackened prime rib, sauteed spinach and roasted red bell peppers, two poached eggs, then covered with hollandaise sauce. And that's not including the side of home fries that they pile alongside this beast. I figured if I was going to cheat on my diet I better make it worthwhile...and it was. Simply amazing! I couldn't even finish half of it as portion size is huge.  Despite it being a busy Sunday and having a full house, they sat us down after only 15 minutes, provided swift courteous service and had our food out in no time. Menu is extensive so you there's something for everybody here.This is a great breakfast spot and seems to cater to the Vegas locals so you know it's good. Will return!"}
{"text":"Overall a very good breakfast place. It can get crazy busy sometimes, but I actually find the waitresses to be more on their game when it is that busy. If we go after the craziness, they are sometimes less attentive for some reason.  I always get the same thing, the Eggs Benedict, and it is pretty much perfect every time. I say pretty much, because I had to learn to ask for them to poach the eggs medium, otherwise you get a runny white, which is gross. Runny yellow, yes, running white, ewww. Potatoes are delicious!  Hubby always gets the three pigs skillet, which I think they recently renamed but he loves it and there is never anything left on the plate.   Price wise, it is very reasonable for Vegas. We always get out of there for less that $30, (20% tip included) which I feel is a good value for that kind of breakfast. We have been many times over the years and bring out of towners here, so we would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Ask for Robert, he's awesome! Very tasty food,  love the fruit option and don't forget the banana bread"}
{"text":"Went here on Monday January 2nd.  The food was very good.  The problem is that the person who served our food - an older woman named Adrienne - did so and then promptly went and talked to some friends/family type folks in the waiting area telling them all how she hasnt got over being sick and she still fighting it.  Here we are 3 days after being served by a sick employee and my family is sick.  Thanks - we're all really enjoying this cold.  Thanks Adrienne...how about next time you dont serve people food when you are sick...that has to be a health code violation."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday around 11 even though it was super busy the service was still great. Got our food decently fast and everything was delicious ^-^ one of my favorite breakfast places! I wasn't a breakfast person before trying this place a couple months ago~    His: Sunrise Mountain Mine: Works Omlette  Positive: The omlette is bigger than my face so expect leftovers and or/ if you eat a lot like me your tummy will be happy ;D  Negative: Sometimes the fruit that they give you along with your food (depending on what you order) it may not always be fresh. My boyfriend and I shared his pineapple and we both had to spit it out bc it was so hard and dry. LOL."}
{"text":"This place is breakfast food heaven! I go here more than the average man should, but with corned beef hash, country fried steak, and their AMAZING bananas nut muffin, no other place seems worthy of my money. Kenny is the man, so if you get him as your server, you're in good hands. Coffee is great and has a huge variety of creamers to add to it. Now that I'm writing this, I'm going to go wake my wife up so we can go eat there!! Banana muffin, here I come!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago at Egg Works located at Town centre, I was quite disappointed in my service with Veronica. She was our server and wasn't doing any of the work. I understand when it's busy that happens but she was busy gossiping not doing her job. Every time I turned my egg over for help; the young gentleman who sat us got us whatever we needed. He had blonde hair and was tall. He didn't seem to mind helping; we were just irritated because he's not our server! When we left to pay he checked us out and smiled and said to have an \"eggcellent\" day. He never was aware we were upset; we never led on. We wanted to tip him and asked him if we could. He smiled and politely refused. My husband tried to pass him money anyway but the host wouldn't accept it. That made a big impression on us. Because of that young man, we will be back. Just didn't realize youngsters existed like him anymore. Quite refreshing! It was on a Sunday this happened. Food was amazing as always just a little disappointed in the server but everyone has an off day."}
{"text":"Just as the rating states, this place is A-OK.   This place is super packed on weekends, so plan accordingly and be prepared to wait. I suggest going BEFORE you are hungry, because you'll definitely have an appetite by the time your table is ready.  Luckily, there isn't usually a wait to sit at the counter, so that's what my boyfriend and I did when we went on a Saturday morning.  Why only 3 stars? Some of you may hate me for saying this - but it's because of their lack of decent hashbrowns. They have potatoes, and although they are tasty, it's not what I like. They do offer a hashbrown option, but they look like what you get from McDonald's and not the shredded potatoes I prefer. Additionally, I like my eggs runny, and I ordered them over easy. They came out over hard with no yolk at all and that is quite disappointing.  I ordered the CFS and it was very tasty. My boyfriend had an omelette with basically the kitchen sink in it and he loved it.  Overall, the service was fast and friendly and I will definitely go back - hopefully on a day when I can try their blood mary mix or a michelada!"}
{"text":"First time going to Egg Works and let me tell you: I'm not sure why I waited so long to go!! Arrived Sunday morning around 10:30, put our name in for a table and about 5 minutes later we were seated. This place was packed though, and I quickly learned why!!  I kept it simple and ordered the classic breakfast, mainly because my friend was telling me how good the potatoes and the muffins are, so I wanted to try them. So glad I did because the seasoning on the potatoes is AMAZING and that warm, freshly baked banana nut muffin was heaven in my mouth. One of my friends got the chocolate chip pancakes, which I had a bite of... yummy!!! My other friend got some sort of chili skillet thing, which I didn't try because I'm not a chili fan.   The service was great and they have these little things that you flip the face on and a server comes by ASAP to see what you need. It's a great system and I wish more places did it that way!   So, my reason for the 4 stars instead of 5? While the seasoning for the potatoes was amazing, the potatoes themselves were dry and not the best texture breakfast potatoes I've had. I know this is little, but dry potatoes are just blah to me.   I will go back, because it was delicious. But I may skip on the potatoes (and instead pick up some of the seasoning to make my own)."}
{"text":"This place is well staffed. They wear very cute shirts. The staff seems genuinely happy, friendly and chatty.  I am incredibly hung over.  They couldn't fill my water glass fast enough.  Those banana muffins are special. Over easy egg whites were slightly runny. The potatoes had good season but they were a little to salty.  The pork chops had paprika seasoning on them and they were good.   The waitress did forget to bring me tobasco. No biggy. She was pretty busy."}
{"text":"Love the menu combinations here! Stopped in for breakfast while I was having graphics installed on my car. I ordered the Mashed Potatoe Omelet,  Amazing! My server, Matt, let me switch my side to fruit as breakfast potatoes would have been over kill. (I love potatoes,  but there is a limit.) Super tasty omelet and the fruit was fresh cut slices. Not the canned fruit you get in some restaurants.  If you are in the area, and hungry you should stop in."}
{"text":"A very mixed experience. The place was jammed but so big that we got seated quickly. Service was good. Started scanning pictures of various breakfast options on Yelp and was immediately distressed to see what were obviously frozen cubed potatoes heaped in ridiculously huge portions with many dishes. Ordered an omelet, which was absolutely top shelf. But it was served with a massive pile of the crappy potatoes, and they were as bad as they looked in pictures - very dry, clearly frozen, devoid of flavor (other than the \"seasoning\" they were coated in) and just.. lousy. And, my wheat toast had to be at least a week old - incredibly dry and obviously very stale. So odd for the side items to be so bad when the omelet was so right. Give me some fresh hash browns and reasonably recent toast, and this would have been a really great breakfast."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot with multiple locations, decided to try the Fort Apache and Flamingo location this time.  I must admit the service was a bit off compared to the location on Rainbow and 215.  I was sat at a table for two waiting for a friend and literally received no service for 10 minutes as I waited.  My friend arrived and I had to tell him no one even came by for a drink order.  A few minutes passed before we were able to flag down a server for our order.  I ordered the classic with scrambled eggs, bacon and fruit instead of the potatoes.  Always get the soft and delicious muffin which seems to fill me up so I only eat half before the meal arrives.  The food is consistent with the other locations and quite satisfying but the service this trip was just a bit off."}
{"text":"Great food and service was fantastic. Will be back. The staff was friendly and made sure I was happy with my meal."}
{"text":"The food was great! The only thing thag bummed us out was that the service wasn't great. We waited a really long time (25 mins) before our server came by and the food was incorrectly prepared for 2/4 dishes. Overall food quality and quantity is good and that's what gives it 4 stars."}
{"text":"I had the works omelet and added advocado.   They were super generous with the advocado.   The omelet and home fries were delicious.   My husband got the tuna melt.  He was very pleased too.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We decided to take our visitors to egg works because of the service and food.  Jennifer greeted us shortly after being sat.  Jennifer was patient as we had two kids in our party.  She checked on us often and offered us banana muffins. Thank u for he great service and good food.  Will be back"}
{"text":"Fabulous in all ways. Nice comfortable restaurant with good lighting and AC, great staff, great food. Ask for PK. He is a great waiter. I used my napkin right away and without asking, he brought a stack of extras. Now that is paying attention! Top notch servers catch stuff like that.   Chicken fried steak was fantastic. The seasoning on the potatoes that they call Haba Diablo is really pretty mellow so don't think it is a fire breather, it works.   A great experience and we will return."}
{"text":"Joshua is the best, EVAR!!!  Had the Denver Omelet with Spinach. Eggs were soft and fluffy. The potatoes were crunchy with the right amount of seasoning. My iced tea was always full."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food, and even better service! Thanks to Ray for being an exceptional server!"}
{"text":"Food and service is excellent!!! Our server Alexa is very attentive and very nice. We will surely come back again"}
{"text":"My dad found this place (He's an electrician) while installing stuff at the bar next door. They had told him \"We just opened we would love for you to come by with your families and tell everybody you know about this place\" So my mom and dad decided to go two weeks later, my sister and I also came along. When we got there we were greeted by a very friendly waitress who sat us down immediately. She took our order for drinks and food. My ideal meal consisted of milk, scrambled eggs, sausage, the works potatoes, and a banana nut muffin. The muffins and potatoes are to die for. My family comes here every weekend but sometimes I try something different such as pancakes, or french toast. Come here for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Terrance was awesome and very friendly. I don't usually get up for breakfast but it was a breath of fresh air having such great service in the morning. Food came out exactly how we requested and it tasted better than anything I could make. Highly recommend the chile relleno & chicken enchilada (aka chicken on chicken) omelette. Thanks again to Terrance for the great breakfast experience!"}
{"text":"Why is this place so popular? Bad coffee and below average food."}
{"text":"First impression was great. Cute bustling breakfast spot with a super pleasant waitress. Jazmin was the best thing about the experience. The food looked appetizing but unfortunately my entire meal was SO over SALTED, it was hardly edible. I didn't bother sending it back because I was with a group.   My spinach eggs Benedict was extremely salty and so were the side potatoes. Additionally the poached eggs were completely runny (not the gooey consistency). I guess I expected a little more based on the great reviews.  I do not recommend the Benedicts. Ask them to hold the salt."}
{"text":"I usually go to the sister restaurant, \"Egg and I\" but we decided to try this location.  Plenty of parking, and  I was really happy that it took only 15 minutes to be seated.  The location is bigger than the other one, and they seem to get people in and out.  They have plenty of TV's and, being Sunday, it was a great place to watch the NFL and have brunch with the family. Unfortunately I'm not into football, but I still enjoyed my breakfast: the pork chops and eggs.  Its 2, thin cut pork chops, cooked perfectly served with the home fries and 2 eggs, and toast, or, their muffin.  Knowing they have large portions, I opted for english muffin.  Stephen had the Cincinnati chili omelette and his mom had the Stuffed French Toast, which was stuffed with eggs and bacon.  HUGE.. where we took 1/2 of it home.  Overall a great meal, and even better that we had a groupon.  It beats eating at the Strip, and we dine where the locals eat."}
{"text":"Great place off strip. Very friendly and great service. Excellent place to fill your tank   Plenty of parking and excepts CC. Enjoyed there breakfast skillet."}
{"text":"Today was not the best experience we have had.  We we're eeated the same time another couple was seated. That couple had the same waitresses us.   We placed our order before that couple (because we looked at the menu before we were seated). Long story short; we barely received our meal as that other couple was leaving.  We never were checked on by our waitress, we stopped another waiteress to find out the status of our meal.  The next time we saw our waitress was when she brought us the check, not even asking if we want a box to go, we ended up stopping someone else (again) for a to go box.   The Cordon Bleu skillet wasn't it's best today.  I understand it's Saturday and busy, but I've had better experiences  here (including on weekend morning)"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a great breakfast and the best customer service. The staff is wonderful and our waiter Chris was the best!!!!"}
{"text":"I came for a quick breakfast before a meeting and the service was amazing!! Marianne was super fast and very polite in understanding my time restrictions.  The only problem I had was with my eggs; my poached eggs were cold. With that said everything else was great! Thanks, I will be back again."}
{"text":"My chili relleno was super good!  Our server Jessica did an awesome job! Great food and great service every time we eat here!"}
{"text":"Went to Egg Works today at 2:45 pm. My server was a very nice guy and everyone was so accommodating seeting us right before closing. We were the last ones in the restaurant. I always get the waffle works and the strawberry were fresh and delicious. Love the service and food overall!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time a couple days ago. Service was good. Food was good but slightly high in price. You could go to the Beach Cafe or Mr. Mamas and probably pay a little less for good food and good service. I was happy with the experience though."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast although the serving size is gigantic.  (I recommend sharing most entrees.)  The dog-friendly patio is the best in the city!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast this morning March 3, 2016. After being seated, our waitress Candice took our drink order within a couple minutes. She was very polite and patient because I hadn't yet decided what I wanted. Our breakfast was very good and large portions. Candice was very attentive and brought me more DrPepper which made me very happy! Thank you Candice for making our first visit a great one. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast!! Love the banana nut muffins they give you! I also like the skillets they have!! Overall a pretty good place to have breakfast in a cute neiborhood!! Sometime is very busy but the service seems to keep up! Good place!"}
{"text":"Our party got various things and everything was average. We were there at like 7:00 and there were only 2 other parties of two people. It took almost an hour to order and receive our food. The wait wasn't bad because it was empty and our table had lots of room, but i don't think the food should've taken that long. I got the New York steak and for $14, I should've gone to south point for $4 steak. The steak was NOT cooked medium rare. It was rare in some parts, well done in some and burnt in many parts. Very unevenly cooked. Also, they burnt our toast and we had to wait even longer than that. Their staff however was friendly, but the food just didn't cut It. Overall very average food with no unique flavors."}
{"text":"Waitress never explained the pancake works to me. Instead she charged me for two pancakes at $749 and classic bfast for $10.49 so she can increase her tab and get more $ for tip. Shady. Food is good but experience was garbage. Paid $18 for a breakfast plate."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was good. Pricing of the food is decent. However, at the end of our meal we found a bug crawling on our food!! We don't know where it came from and how long it's been there. I told the cashier at the end, just to let them know. She said she would tell them what happened. Not sure if we will be coming back."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times, but never again. There was food on the wall next to our table and trash everywhere on the floor. There were 15 people in line waiting to pay their bills, and I waited 20 minutes in line to pay. The manager did not even say he was sorry for my wait."}
{"text":"Had a lovely breakfast. Candace was a great hostess!"}
{"text":"Excellent food & service, Maggie was awesome!!  I never try this place before, recommended!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Egg Works so we decided to try them on a whim. I dont know if we just hit them on a bad day, but it was possibly the worst breakfast I've had in a while. The service was decent, we were seated immediately. The place was very busy, so I thought we were in for a winner. I had french toast and my Mom had biscuits and gravy. My french toast was less than mediocre - the bread was spongey.. My Mom's biscuits were absolutely awful, they tasted like they were made with some kind of chicken stock/boullion. The gravy was good. We let them know and they even said they were trying out a new recipe to replace the frozen biscuits they had been serving, but were having trouble perfecting it. They took it off the bill, which I was pleased about. I also felt like for what it was, they were extremely pricey. I've had better breakfast at Lenny's."}
{"text":"ANY egg choice you make here, you can't go wrong. Everything is EGGcellent and EGGceptional!!!!   I have eaten here for breakfast SEVERAL times and whenever I do, I am not disappointed.   What wins the BEST breakfast award, you ask?  Drum roll please:  The Mashed Potato Omelette:  Bacon omelette stuffed with garlic mashed potatoes and melted cheddar and jack cheese, dollop of sour cream bringing together my two favorite meal times, Dinner and Breakfast to make my new best friend BRINNER!   Best side dish award?   Corned beef hash and the FAMOUS banana nut muffin that EVERYONE has mentioned in their reviews!  My awards are the most serious of all breakfast awards- My cat told me so."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 star I would. The cashier Linda is a racist older lady. At the register it's says have ID ready for credit cards & debit. Well my African American husband was asked for his ID. Although we watched her not ask the 5 white customers in front of her for their IDs or the white customer behind us. When I questioned her she was mumbling & fumbling her words saying because she knows them they come everyday & proceeded to point to a white man standing next to us & said see like him. WTF does that have to do with anything! I should have asked her the Guys name. I was so steamed at her lying ass. All customers should be treated equal. You might as well have a sign posted white customers don't need to show your ids black customers have your Id ready. I'm reporting this restaurant the BBB & every organization I can think of regarding racist business practices! DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS!!  Since my 1st review I received racist emails as well as kind emails applauding me for standing up bc they too had experienced the same behavior from this business. Please see photos. One was from someone with the initial L & had the restaurant's notice as a profile picture. The cashier's name was Linda how ironic. (To that person who I am sure is reading this; I'm Asian get your facts straight buddy.) He she is hiding behind a fake profile using the same initial as the employees. I'm standing up to what I see is as an injustice. It goes back to when restaurants had signs saying \"whites\" & \"blacks\" to determine where you sat by the color of your skin. I hope this establishment stops hiding behind emails & publicly puts an end to this racial profiling."}
{"text":"Just off the airplane and needing to 'layer' for the impending Vegas adventure. Egg Works (Part of the Egg & I family) fits the bill perfectly. This chain of egg diners rises above mediocrity and serves some damn fine egg dishes. My rellenos omelet was delish. Friendly and fast service (assuming you aren't waiting for a table). What makes this place noteworthy is that you find yourself amazed that such solid food is coming out of a short-order kitchen. And, really, all my staff interactions were above and beyond friendly! Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"Ashley is a great waitress! She is very helpful and very patient with new comers like us. Ask for her when you come here. The omelettes are very filling and delicious. Overall a great experience. This place is a keeper!"}
{"text":"Love that there was no wait times. We got seated and ordered our delicious food Hawaiian Style breakfasts coffee was good. Our waitress Tina was very friendly and helpful we will visit again"}
{"text":"Early morning flight from NYC had us in Vegas shortly after 9am...  Hungry from the long flight we decided to go and grab some breakfast.  After a quick Yelp search we realized that Egg Works 2 was just around the corner from McCarran Airport.  We forgot that it was Saturday morning, so the place was sort of busy.  We decided to sit at the counter since there were seats open.  Service was prompt and our order was prepared in no time. The menu is extensive, which made it difficult to make a decision.  My buddy ordered some sort of skillet which he really enjoyed.  I went with a bacon, egg and cheese on a Ciabatta roll with home fries.    Can't beat a really tasty breakfast, served quickly at a good price.  Would go here again if I'm looking to get some AM grub while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food! Fast service! Fruit was fresh no run of the mill food here! I would bring my family here definitely. Price if meal goes from $6-$13. Great value!! Banana nut muffin is killers!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me, their food doesn't seem to agree with me. The last time I was there I had a skillet with chicken, spinach, and mushrooms, which does taste good, but which sadly did not agree with my system. The dishes aren't particularly inventive, but they are pretty tasty, and I think that unless you have the same reaction I did, you would probably enjoy a breakfast here."}
{"text":"It's like a better version of a waffle house, basically. I had the veggie benedict. Solid, a little bit overpriced,  would've liked a few more greens with it. Service is friendly but not the most attentive. The menu is large which is both good and bad. I would come back, but I can't say I would be that anxious to do so."}
{"text":"Not only is the food here delicious (try the Stromboli) but the service from Darlyn was phenomenal. I asked her what kind of veggie burger they use because I'm allergic to nuts. She went back to the kitchen and took a picture of the ingredients list so that I could see for myself that it was safe. In addition to that, she was courteous, attentive, and friendly."}
{"text":"I've tried literally over 30 breakfast spots all over town and some how I find myself coming here almost every Sunday. They have the best kids menu: Buckaroo is my daughter's favorite,  come with eggs, potatos or fruit (a lot of it!), canadian bacon, their MUST have banana nut muffin and orange juice, all for $4.50. As for the adult menu, I love their country fried steak, omelets, and pretty much everything I've tried. Service is FAST, never had to wait too long for our food. Staff is nice, some of them are just nicer than others but overall a great spot. Highly recommend,  specially if you have children."}
{"text":"Candice was our server today and she was excellent! Upbeat, informative and made sure we got exactly what we were looking for you! Thank you Candice for making our experience so amazing!"}
{"text":"Veronica was such a sweetheart! Very attentive and personable! The food is delicious as always!"}
{"text":"We love this place, the food is always good especially the banana muffins and the food comes quickly! Delicious breakfast and wonderful service today! Thank you Amy B!"}
{"text":"1. The works Bloody Mary 2. In house banana muffins 3. Habla diablo potatoes 4. Carrot cake French toast 5. Tuna melt  Guest service, large food portions, great pricing, delicious food and kid family friendly. Worth the wait if busy!"}
{"text":"Good service. Although Maria forgot one item or two. No silverware and forgot the creamers that were asked. Still enjoyed my self. Husbands happy with ALL his food. Oj is just the way I like it. This is our second time and will be back. Btw Maria made up with a banana muffin that I can get for free now that I checked in on Yelp. Lol I will use for a later date so yes, we will be back."}
{"text":"What's the saying? I can't believe I ate the whole thing?   It's like that.   Ended up here for breakfast a good twelve hours after we had dinner at grimaldi's across the street. Haha, good thing it is so easy to navigate Vegas.   Cute breakfast spot, reminds me of those local joints in SD, and SB. Not a diner but a place focused on eggs, pancakes, and all things breakfast.   Worth a visit, good service and it's where the locals are! My favorite part was the \"happy face\" egg sign that you flip over if you need something. it turns into a sad face. Awwwwww.   The kids breakfast menu has spaghetti for breakfast. How amazing.   Would love a calm quiet place like this to sit and read over coffee and breakfast (that isn't ihop! ) cuz millbrae pancake house, stacks, and the like are not the place to lounge over breakfast. Somehow I think we'd be kicked out of stacks if we sat there w ipads and newspapers on a Sunday morning...."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and many other Eggworks location, but i love this one the most.  1. Convience. It's right by 215-Rainbow, so u can get to super easy. 2. Atmosphere is great. 3. Service is always a plus and it's the main reason that I coming here. Everyone is nice and friendly here, but Nicole is overly-awesome. She always greet u with a smile and makes sure that you leave with one too. Love Nicole and would recommend this to everyone"}
{"text":"Always a great place for breakfast. I'm from Hawaii and there Island Favorite has what I need to get my home fix meal. Great service from Victoria she was so good even with a party of 8 she's amazing !!!! Thanks Victoria  !!!"}
{"text":"From the smile that they use to great you at the front door, to the smile on your table to keep you happy. This place is doing breakfast right, great orange juice, fresh warm banana nut muffin, delicious bacon avocado omelet and awesome breakfast potatoes.  Nice ambiance, TVs, cool train running through the restaurant on a track suspended from the ceiling. Oh, did I mention reasonable prices? And Winner of Las Vegas Review Journal's GOLD Best of Vegas 2 years in a row. This one is worth trying, have a great day!!! SMILE"}
{"text":"The parking lot was full I thought for sure we were going to have to wait.  To my surprise we were sat immediately.  I has the veggie works Benny.  DELICIOUS!  My hubby had  the works skillet he liked it a lot too!  We love the service!  Great place!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Great food at a great price.  Amy L. knew egg-actly what we wanted to order and tweaked the little changes with ease and expertise.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is a must go when you're in Vegas. If your are an egg lover such as myself, definitely make the trip.  The place gets crowded with tourist however locals make their regular stops Sundays after church. Great for families and great for couples.  Best breakfast in Vegas."}
{"text":"TINA! Seriously, Tina. If she's working, see if you can get seated with her. A group of friends and I were visiting Vegas from Boston for a bachelor party and she was the best part of our breakfast. Which is saying A LOT since the food is delicious and inexpensive, and the portions are huge! Five of us ate and had drinks for $100, had food leftover, and were full for hours after.  Tina was super attentive, incredibly friendly, and made us all want to hang out with her later. If we could have come back here during our short trip we would have - both for the food and for Tina!"}
{"text":"Our \"go to\" place when I want traditional breakfast. Banana muffin is really good especially if you pair it with coffee (i believe it contains walnut, just a heads up if you have a nut allergy). My son loves their spaghetti (kids meal comes with a drink). I usually get their country fried steak. But I've tried their country benny which is delicious! I've also tried the Sunrise mountain, which in my opinion, lacked flavor. Maybe because I ordered it with ham instead of bacon or sausage? Idk. But it was missing something, so I had to put a lot of Tabasco (I still liked it, but maybe will go for a diff. Meat next time). The staff are always nice and friendly! Always welcoming and never rush us!"}
{"text":"It is always busy for a reason. The food is fantastic! I love the breakfast tostada. I like the place and the service is good. Plus you can change your egg upside down if you want to get their attention."}
{"text":"One of the cutest and tastiest breakfast joints. Definite 2 thumbs up form service, to an extensive menu, to a dog friendly patio. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, big portions. Great service! A tad too salty for me. Great food server Victoria ! We will be back."}
{"text":"Yummy every single time!!! We always have nothing less than great service. This time Dolly was our server and she's awesome!"}
{"text":"... Its ok food. I  been here twice. Once I got the chili,  and the other time i got the Spinach benny The benny was actually wonderful! Perfect combo of raw spinach and yummy sauce!  I do recall my mom getting a breakfast burrito and it was hideous. It had gravy and all kinds of shit in it. Just nothing acidic to balance it. It was eggs and gravy and meat. No salsa or tomato. She kindly asked the waitress to change her order, it was  yucky. She did, and everything worked out...   We asked for a coffee cup and the girl put the cup rim down on the dirty table. I understand that is how you set up a table, but usually when the rim is down there is a napkin or paper doily under it. She just didnt get it.   Good thing: they put a sign on your table that lets the staff know if you need anything. Thats a good idea!  Prices are good! Location is great. Not sure what I keep missing about this place that others are raving about? Maybe I am not ordering the right stuff???. Sorry. If that changes I will def update this."}
{"text":"This place is Eggcellent!   After reading my Yelp buddy Judy C.'s review of Egg Works........I quickly booked marked this place to give it a go when I was out here in Las Vegas.  Apparently Egg Works has 5 locations - 4 restaurants are in the Las Vegas area, and 1 restaurant is in the Henderson area.  This location on E. Sunset Road was not too far from our hotel...........I wanna say it was about an 8 mile drive to this place.   When we got here in the late morning (10:30 AM or so) the restaurant was packed! We had a short 5 minute wait before be got seated outside. (They have indoor & outdoor seating). May I recommend if you're from Hawaii and not use to the winter cold.........you should sit inside, because when the wind is blowing, and you're not moving around.............it can get pretty nippy outside. Lol!  Upon scanning the menu, I decided to get the \"Sundance Special\", which is basically a Veggie Omelet which consisted of the following - Spinach, Sliced Mushrooms, and Artichoke Hearts folded with Swiss Cheese, with a special works artichoke cheese filling, topped with Feta Cheese, and fresh Tomatoes. I also added some blacken chicken with my veggie omelet, and with my meal, there was this square cut potatoes that came on the side.........  One of my friends had ordered the Country Fried Steak, and my other friend ordered a Spinach Benny.  With my breakfast, I got a Banana muffin, and I must say it was soft & warm. It went great with my pot of coffee!  Overall I loved my Sundance Special........the veggie omelet was awesome! What I didn't care for was the square cut potatoes, because the potatoes were rather salty & dry. I ate very little of that, and had to stop because it was just too salty for me.  The menu you here is pretty extensive.........and they are basically opened for breakfast & lunch. as the hours here go from 6 AM to 3 PM."}
{"text":"My wife and I had breakfast today at our Egg Works, near Sun City Anthem.  One of my favorite breakfast dishes is a Loco Moco.  When I asked our waitperson, Rita, to make sure the beef patty was not overcooked, she assured me she knew exactly what I wanted and would tell the chef/cook to prepare it that way.    Boy, she was right!  The burger patty, when I barely cut into it with my fork, melted into perfectly cooked rice & blended with a dark, rich gravy in a way I've never had before!  I've had this dish in Hawaiian restaurants and none came close to the perfection of this one today.    I thank Rita for making sure my Loco Moco was the best...EVER!"}
{"text":"The complete OPPOSITE of a charming breakfast experience. Shitty food, shittier service. I would've had a 10x better breakfast cooking it at home. Everything was dry, old, and cold. They had no hasbrowns (what kind of breakfast joint doesn't have a hash brown option?) so they ended up serving me some old, dry and overly salted \"seasoned potatoes\". Their bacon was ALL fat and no meat and their eggs were soaked in oil. The cherry on top was that all of the waitresses were rude except for the hostess and the older waitress. Who are the leaders that are letting this place sink? This place definitely needs a 360 degree look-over ASAP."}
{"text":"I was really excited when i learned that an egg works was opening up around the corner from my house.Unfortunately upon going there it's safe to say that i'm highly disappointed. I understand that the restaurant has just recently opened but i cant say that i'm impressed. The service was slow! I know that during the time of our trip their main customers were the elderly but COME ON! After being seated it took about 20 min before someone came around to take our order. We had to resort to flipping the unhappy egg.   For those of you who don't know, Egg works and Egg and I both use the \"run forest run\" system. They have happy eggs for those who don't need assistance that flip over and reveal an unhappy egg which means you need assistance.   The food wasn't that great either. I had the waffle which was pretty routine, nothing really great or bad to say about it. My girlfriend got the one of the crepes and when i tried it it wasn't that bad. I did drown it in hot sauce but still... it was OK. The worst part of our meal was one of the tostadas. The lettuce used in the tostada was still wet and that caused, what should be a crispy and delicious shell, to become soggy and mushy. The taco meat was over sauced and  that caused the lettuce to wilt as well. Overall the dish was really bad. They were able to take it off of our bill since we only took a few bites from it."}
{"text":"Exceptional service from our server,  VERONICA!! Even though the wait was long and the kitchen was backed up, she took great care of us. Our food was delicious and the experience was a good one thanks to our server.  We usually come on the weekends, so we expect it to be busy.  Portion sizes are huge and I can only usually eat half."}
{"text":"I've been to egg works a few times.    This was my first time at this particular location.   I like the menu even though I do believe that it's a little too big.  I like that there are so many choices and that you can pretty much get whatever you want depending on your mood.   I will say that the flavor of stuff is usually a little lackluster but I don't expect fine dining here.  Just know you might have to add salt or hot sauce and ketchup to stuff.    I usually looove the banana nut muffin.  Warm with butter is the best.   This time we went the muffin tasted a little metallic and it was not warm.   Maybe because I got the free yelp one?   Not sure.  Also the potatoes were a little off.   Like there was too much flavor but they tasted like nothing.   Hard to explain.   We had ok service.   Very attentive at first but then very hard to get toward the end.   Overall I'm not going to stop coming to egg works but it definitely isn't my first choice."}
{"text":"Mover priced. Over greasy n buttery, over n undercooked, stale fruit n raisins, misorders,   3 strikes n ur out."}
{"text":"Go. Seriously. You will not be disappointed one bit!  We were craving breakfast food and decided to check this place out. We shared a skillet and a few breakfast sides, each of which were cooked to perfection and super tasty. The atmosphere here is cute, clean, and just what you want for enjoying your breakfast.   What really made our day being here was our awesome server, Tina. She was so cool, upbeat, easy to talk with, and was the most accommodating server you could ever hope to have. We plan on returning for more good eats and to see Tina again. :)"}
{"text":"Banana bread french toast. That's all you need to know because its delicious. Eggs, yeah, ok. Bacon...definitely could improve with thicker applewood slices. But this banana bread french toast, with apple compote and some whipped cream was a moist, flavorful, delicious item to try. Try it. Enjoy it.   Special shoutout to my waitress Tely....who was fantastic. Great service, always checking up on me. Brought over the whipped cream (not part of the menu) and said add this. 5/5 for Tely's service.  Place was pretty busy for Noon on a Saturday, so again I found counter space for a quick sit down. I needed food to replenish my body after a 4 mile hike. They have a full menu with everything from eggs, crepes, benedicts, sandwiches, etc.   Located on the corner of Sunset and Eastern across from Sunset Park."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food but the overhead train was a treat.  Nothing spectacular but it was great comfort food that tasted good.  Crystal was a delight.  Did a great job with our order and kept coming back to check if we needed anything.  Will definitely go back to try something else..."}
{"text":"Love breakfasts here. I think the potatoes are my favorite. Always good. We have also done business breakfast groups with success which is tough for breakfast."}
{"text":"Always consistently good which is why people line up. I love the potatoes with everything. Waffle, pancakes, bacon, don't care just make sure to get the potatoes too!"}
{"text":"Breakfast here was really good. My entire family loved there meal to the point that my kids ate everything on their plates. No take home boxes for us here.  I loved their Mexican Omelette with the chunks of chorizo and jalapeños. This just hit the breakfast spot. Loved their banana bread muffin, you can tell it was freshly made and very moist and good. Will definitely return when i go back to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We have nothing but raves for the Egg Works on E. Sunset Rd.  Our friend in California told us that going to this restaurant is a must--the food selection is phenomenal and the quality of the food superb.  What added to the pleasant experience was a waitress named Chelsea who was extremely pleasant, helpful, and efficient.  What I thought was a quaint touch was the way you can make known you need to speak to your waiter/waitress.  There is a yellow tag next to your table.  Under that tag is another tag with a different color (black).  When you flip the yellow tag so the black is showing, your waiter/waitress knows that you want their attention avoiding the need to shout out their name or trip them as they walk by.  When we return to LV in the future, Egg Works is on our list to go for a great meal and wonderful service."}
{"text":"I always leave happy and satisfied. Food was delicious my servers name was Donna, she was fast and very nice.    Must try this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Egg & I many times  and had wonderful service and food, so expected good things from Egg Works.  I was wrong.  The service was terrible and the hostess had a terrible attitude.  I had my little service dog with me and they refused to bring her some water because we were eating inside.  You cannot discriminate against service dogs.  I will NEVER go there again and don't recommend anyone else go either.  Instead go to Egg & I on Sahara where the service is exceptional."}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service the variety of food on the menu is really great. Try the Banana nut muffins !!!"}
{"text":"Veronica was our server and she made our first time experience at Egg Works worth it. She was attentive and patient with our group. The food portions are big which was great for the 3 guys that came with us. Because of Veronica we will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best restaurant for breakfast!  Stopped here for a breakfast with family and found the menu to be fun reading.  I ordered the veggie omelet and it was delicious!  Our server, Theresa was so nice and helpful with her suggestions, as there is so much they offer to eat. The coffee was great too!   Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast with the family! Friendly staff, good Midwest style food, clean bathrooms, and the country decor makes you forget you're in a Las Vegas suburb.   My son loves the pancakes that looks like Mickey Mouse with a piece of bacon for a smile!"}
{"text":"All I can say is I really like this place or I wouldn't keep coming back. I love the service the people the location and the food. I think I will try something new today. I need some eggs in my life!"}
{"text":"This location is always busy and I can tell why. We usually sit at the counter because it's only two of us eating. But we have had two great waitresses one is fairly new , CeCe she was very attentive to our needs and made sure we got our order right. There was a person who was giving her a hard time next to us but she explained to them what type to order if they wanted food a certain way. But she was very friendly and helpful to us. The next waitress is Lisa, she really knows how to run her tables and counters she remembers us from coming here often. Which we will continue to return to this location. She is very friendly and nice to speak with always willing to make sure your cup,is filled and your order is right. These type of employees are what make a company great and get customers to be returning frequently I bring all my out of town guests here because if you want a local place to eat a good breakfast lunch place you should go here and that's what we do."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for breakfast. Friendly and fast service. Tried the house made corn beef and hash, very good. Stand out would be the warm banana muffin. Would go back just for that."}
{"text":"I am still looking for an incredible place to have Breakfast or Brunch outside the Strip and I still cannot find it! I went to the Egg Works following the Yelp reviews and don't get me wrong, I wasn't disapointed by the place. The food was good and overall experience was satisficing.   Atmosphere 0/5: That's a Killer, I don't know if all the Egg Works looks like this but it's just terrible to have Neon as lighting, even more when you're hangover on a Sunday morning! From outside, the place looks nice and I believe it's a new joint they just opened, but inside, it's a different story unfortunately. Food 4/5: Breakfast is good actually. I like the potatoes, I think it's mixed with Paprika! Awesome experience and the Banana Walnut Muffin as a starter is awesome! I used the Foursquare Check-In Special! My friend had the fried-chicken steak and it looked really good! I had the Breakfast burrito, a killer! Service 5/5: Great service by our waiter always aware of his tables and making sure we were ok. A+  I am still reticent to go or no because of the atmosphere. As I usually say, the atmosphere of the restaurant count as much as the food for me so I hoped they could work on that aspect. You should give it a try tho, you might like it."}
{"text":"Was in on 11/29, hubby and I stopped in for a quick breakfast. Diana was our server, must say she was awesome. She greeted us right away with a smile, she took our order right away. And  our drinks were never empty and she made a point to check on us. Even with a busy section she didn't miss a beat.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Walked in this morning for breakfast and couldn't bring ourselves to stay. Felt like a barnyard meets trailer park. Hostess and waitstaff covered in tattoos and greasy hair highlighted every color of the rainbow. Sat at a freezing cold table in the middle of this mess and when asked for a booth, was told it was all they had (I counted 3 empty booths). Really??? Then the hostess said \"pretty much\". Yeah, I don't think so. Decided we wanted a better dining experience, so we left. Not paying for dirty chaos. Sorry.   Came to the Cracked Egg a very short distance down the road and VERY happy with the service and ambiance."}
{"text":"Egg Works definitely deserves its high star rating.  The service was friendly and helpful.  The food came out fast.  Try the biscuits and gravy.  Delicious!  The banana bread was a revelation."}
{"text":"Amy L was a great server very courteous right on top of everything! Couldn't ask for better service! & food was great!!!"}
{"text":"Egg Works is notorious for a wait, but if you're a party that's three or less, this location can get you in and out. One of the more ideal places to go on the west side of town if you're looking for a full breakfast that has an over-abundance of sides, because for the price they offer, you get more than what you expect out of the portions (I would even go as far to say maybe even too much!)  Ordered the vegetable crepe without the swiss cheese, and got sides of wheat bread and seasoned potatoes. The vegetable crepe is HUGE and delicious, and they give you more seasoned potatoes than you can need! If you're a bread lover, they'll give you five slices in this meal! As delicious as it was, I could only finish half of the entire plate. Service was fast and friendly, and is even more so when you sit at the bar top when it's just for two (another reason why I enjoyed it... in and out in no time!)  I can understand how the unusual bright lighting could be a problem with enjoying your breakfast in that atmosphere (maybe they don't want hungover people enjoying too much time grubbing out in the mornings?), but the bright lighting didn't bother me whatsoever (and I appreciated it for waking me up some!) If the bright lights bother you, they have an outdoor porch area to enjoy the beautiful morning!  One of the better Egg Works locations in Vegas, I was very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Incredible brunch/breakfast! The croissant breakfast was devilishly delicious and I wish I could eat there every day! If you're in the Summerlin area and need a good, solid breakfast, you gotta check it out!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Egg Works and it was a great find. The menu is quite extensive and will take several visits to really get a good sampling. I had a great Frittata with chorizo that was on special for the day and it was a tasty creation. My buddy had Veggie Eggs Benedict that was perfectly prepared and his son had some French toast that was decorated into a face with the fruit and bacon and was a big hit. Thanks to our server Bridgett who rounded out the experience with excellent service and a great attitude. I will definitely be back to enjoy this breakfast spot."}
{"text":"The staff was very accomodating to my hockey team.  The wait was lengthy, but we showed up at a busy time, and it gave us all a chance to chat.  Once we got seated, they were very solicitous, and gave us great service.  Service was quick, as well.  They checked on us regularly, and fixed anything that seemed amiss.  If you have a chance, check out their website, www.theeggworks.com.  I ordered the chicken pot pie.  The serving was rather large, so I couldn't finish it.  It was served in a bread bowl, and was the ultimate in comfort food.  The chicken and veggies were in a warm, creamy sauce.  I was in heaven!  Looking around at my teammates' entrees, I noticed that the biscuits and gravy looked great!  I'd come back to try that choice!"}
{"text":"The carnitas rancheros is to die for.  the service is impeccable.  and you will find yourself unable to resist stuffing their banana muffins in your pockets.  I came here twice on my last trip and will be coming here every morning in the future. especially on the day you leave since it opens at 6 am and I like to leave on the early flight Monday rather than Sunday night.  It's an easy drive from the strip if you just head east away from the madness to S. Eastern Avenue, and then south to E. Sunset. From the MGM, it was like 5 minutes. just on the far side of the airport (and like two minutes from your rental car drop off)"}
{"text":"Love this place, come almost every weekend. Love their omelets and especially yummy Huevos Rancheros!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice on this place only.. I am so happy with the service, great food, and most especially the area."}
{"text":"As always egg works knocks it out of the park once again! My girlfriend and I came to this location for breakfast while waiting for our car at ABC Hyundai. We were quickly seated as it wasn't busy, but we went early enough to where everyone normally is still asleep.   This location has a brick oven to do pizzas and such which is pretty cool! Next time we go I'm eager to try the pizzas! My girlfriend ordered the Hawaiian plate and I ordered my usual haole loco which was pretty good. I have noticed everywhere makes it different, it's not always that bad.   Service was fantastic and the food came out in a timely matter!"}
{"text":"Every week my girlfriend and I come here for breakfast or lunch, depends when we wake up. I guess you could call us regulars! Today we had Manuela as our server and she did an amazing job! My girlfriend wasn't a fan of a breakfast item and Manuela told her that she could get something else instead of paying for something she didn't like. Which is a first, cause I've never heard anything like that before, but it is was nice! This place always has the best service and that's why we come here all the time!! So thank you Manuela!!"}
{"text":"WORST BREAKFAST EVER!   I ordered the crepes.  Okay, a crepe is a very thin, light, delicate pancake.  When the server brought my order it was a massive, thick, doughy \"something\". That looked like an omelette!  When I told her I ordered the crepe, she replied \"this is the crepe\"!  When I explained to her what a crepe should be, she called a woman over, who I am assuming was a manager!  I explained to her, also that I ordered the crepe and said it was a thin pancake, she became very defensive and said, \"well, that is not how we make it; this is how we make it!\"  No offer to rectify the matter.  I took two bites and it tasted worse than it looked....very heavy, and doughy.  Needless to say, I didn't eat it.  As mentioned, there was no offer to correct the matter.  I was paying full price, no coupon or Groupon like most of the other diners.   The was no offer to take off my meal or discount the bill, even though I never ate their version of a crepe.  Due to terrible food and bad at tide, we will never return.  There are too many breakfast venues that serve good,food and have better service."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a year, so thought we would give it another chance.  I ordered the California Crepe and partner ordered the Bandito Breakfast ( I think it was called that.)  When I think of a crepe, I think of a very thin, pancake like batter rolled with filling.  When my \"crepe\" came it was like a pancake omelet.  It was huge, and very thick \"breading\"!  I thought the waitress brought the wrong item, but no.  It tasted \"heavy\" and was greasy and \"doughy\"!  I could only eat half.  The Bandito breakfast, (or whatever). Looked like dog food.  It did not look appetizing!  It was cooked too long and \"crispy\"!  It was not fully eaten either! The only redeeming part of breakfast was the smattering of fresh fruit and banana muffin.  I ordered fruit instead of \"The Works\" potatoes, as I remembered the potatoes were dry and salty.  (They still looked that way!)  Service was just okay!  We did not have silverware, we had to ask.  Waitress only came to table to bring the check.  No refills.  She wasn't very friendly, either!  Sourpus,  There are too many other good breakfast venues in the area, so will be hard pressed to return soon!"}
{"text":"Uhm what can I say.. Well banana muffin and toast both burnt. Presentation doesn't look anything like the pictures posted. Don't know if it's bc we were there at 3pm and ready to shut down, that the food was not tasty at all. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"my family loves this place! great food and friendly service! eat here all the time and never a complaint. the food is always very good and tons of things to try on the huge menu.   something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming to Egg Works for the great food and service.  Today I had Ashley as my server.  Enjoyed her friendly and efficient service."}
{"text":"Always a great breakfast. Great food great service. If I owned this business, I'd want it run like this. ....... (\"and the people!?\") make ya feel like family. Thanks again for a high level of service, and food to die for....."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way home from Vegas... food was amazing!! Had the enchilada omelet and my husband had the chili hash.  Huge portions and amazing service.  Our waiter Raul was perfect! He was attentive, funny and polite.  Would definitely make this a stop every visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Omgggg this place is to dieee for! We had the three pigs omelette and the chicken fried steak skillet. They were both incredible. Our server was Jessica and she was killing it on the patio. She had 9 tables and was short a busser but still managed to be totally attentive to every table. She was incredible. Definitely a new favorite breakfast spot!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for something different. Loved the Cabo Breakfast Burrito and the potatos. The banana/walnut muffins were delicious too. Our server PK was the best."}
{"text":"It was good the wait wasn't very long. Staff is friendly, nothing exceptional. The only thing was my Benny was so soggy :/  Other than that it was ok."}
{"text":"Great service by Ali for a first time experience I was very pleased and the food was good, service expedite and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"5 stars for the service. We live in the Bay Area and each time we come over Vegas, we try to stop here to see our great waiter PK! Such a nice waiter to have for your first meal of the day! The food is good too! Great combo to have in the morning! Make sure to check it out! Highly recommend PK to serve you!"}
{"text":"Amazing service,  been here many times, our server Manny was extremely nice and super attentive."}
{"text":"Took my friends here from Utah for Sunday brunch and Nikki did an amazing job taking care of us really well for how busy it was! Good portions for the price and best potatoes!   Came back again and fast service! Manny was awesome :)"}
{"text":"EGG WOOOOOOOOORKS.  I gotta give it up to them for their corned beef hash. It's pretty good. I wouldn't say it's the best ever, but it is definitely up there. I don't know why I chose to get scrambled eggs on it. Bad move on my part, but it was still amazing.   The banana nut muffin is OK. I don't quite understand how they're \"famous\" for it.   A friend of mine ordered some country benedict with gravy. I'm just not a huge gravy fan, and this stuff was just not working with me. It reminded me of those boxed gravies, which I cannot stand."}
{"text":"Our server was Eggggsaleeent! You go Alexa! You Rock!! Her service was great! Definitely recommend her as a Top Notch Waitress!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The southwestern cobb salad is amazing! So is the huevos rancheros! Our waitress, Manuela, is such a sweetheart! We always ask for her. She is so helpful! Will go back again and again."}
{"text":"i wrote this place off as being just another breakfast spot for a while now but this was out first stop today! and man was it the right choice!!!! its my new favorite breakfast spot.  the omelets are stupid huge and comes with a mountain of potatoes.  both of ours where perfect and they come with delicious banana muffins ( some came home with me). i cant wait to try there banana nut french toast next time.   we shared a plate of the pancakes, there not bad but they just didnt seem all that spectacular but in all fairness we where already stuffed when we got to them.   our server Ashley was amazing! its hard to find some one who is excellent at there job and still fun.   overall its a little on the spendy side for breakfast food but the quality and the service justify it. we WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"I must go there 4-5 times per week. Food is good, staff is pretty good. Order the Works Crepe - the dressing is insane!!"}
{"text":"The host of a restaurant makes a big impression on customers right when they walk in and today left a pretty bad impression on me. There was a gentleman who asked me for my info right away and then there was a young man seating people named Tyler. Tyler had two people walk in that he knows and immediately asked them if they wanted to sit outside to get seated quickly. My fiancé, my daughter (in a stroller) and I were also waiting to be seated outside. My fiancé stood up and asked him to make sure he still had us on the list and he said, yes. Then, he welcomed his friends again as if he didn't know who they were. It's one thing to wait because of business, I understand that. But watching the host try to seat the people he knows first is a little degrading."}
{"text":"We are so happy we stopped here! The yelp reviews don't lie, this place was amazing! Our waitress Diane was the best she went above and beyond to make sure our first time here was amazing. The banana nut muffins are to due for! My wife had the Loco Moco and I had the banana bread french toast, both were absolutely delicious! It was clean, family friendly, fast service, and service again was great!"}
{"text":"Great meal EVERY time. We had Marianne as our server and she was fantastic!  Chile relleno omelet is amazing and not to be missed. They do half sizes as well. A must try in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Egg works is a must stop place, off the Vegas strip! The banana muffins are to die for! Crepes and omelets are rad! Our waitress Candace is flippin amazing. The food was fast and she was welcoming friendly....and also shared our love of muffins! Please please go here this is seriously a gem!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a seat at the counter to eat breakfast today. Caitlin was great and very personable.  Food is always great and my usual isn't on the menu (although it should be) the kitchen does a great job and always gets it right."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  Friendly staff and server came right away for our orders.  Will be back again !  The potato's are the best... all the eggs Benny are great and country fried steak ! Yum"}
{"text":"Extensive menu, generous portions, great flavor... and friendly staff to boot! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service.  Strawberry & Cream French Toast is yummy. Candice is awesome!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town all week and wanted to try it, so we tried it on our way out yesterday. Nice decor, a step up from IHop. Our server Alex was great. A pot of coffee to the table was a nice touch from the old days. I had the spinach bene and she had a veggie omelet. Both were good, the potatoes were ok but a little heavy on the seasoning. The muffin was over the top good, gratis from the store. Even saved some for the flight home later!"}
{"text":"Their breakfast is eggcellent I enjoyed the Santa Cruz burrito with their special Santa Cruz sauce. I mean thinking all of the possibilities using eggs in every dish. There was something missing in the burrito and I think that there was no salsa or beans, the chorizo was there and it was good but they could of pack it with more flavor and add sour cream in it (on the side is good which I had). I only visit this place once and I would like to explore and try most of the egg dishes. Until next year..."}
{"text":"Egg works is the best!!  Our server Veronica was awesome!  She was very attentive and always right there when we needed anything.  We'll see you next week..."}
{"text":"TL;DR: I like this place and they have top notch customer service. I would recommend the french toast and any benedicts, but I would not recommend the omelette.  This place is pretty good. What we ordered: The Works Omelette, Spinach Benny, Bacon Maple Cream Stuffed French Toast, and 2 Coffees.  Cons: This place is called Egg Works so I thought a safe choice would be an omelette, but the omelette was not that good at all. It was actually very bland and was layered too thick. It was overcooked on the bottom and was sweating oil on the side of the plate. I would have given it 5 stars, but the omelette was sadly disappointed.  Pros: The best part of the meal I believe is the seasoned potatoes. They were well seasoned, crispy but not too crispy. With a little dab of ketchup, they filled me up and made me happy. When I go back, I will always order the potatoes. The salsa verde was amazing! It saved the omelette. I was ready to not eat the omelette after the first bite, but the green salsa verde has a very rich flavor and make the omelette edible.  The french toast by itself was ok at best, but the cream cheese was the staple element of the french toast. The candied walnuts added a very nice touch to the french toast. It was good, but I don't think it was worth the $10.50. Eggs Benedict was good as well. We asked for a side of the chipotle hollandaise sauce and damn it was good. The eggs benedict was already good by itself but the special sauce they have makes it even better.  **Recommendation for management: Reduce the menu. The menu is extremely extensive. Long menus are proven not to be good. It may give customers a larger selection, but creates a lot more work and tends to end in lower quality food for consumers. Keep up the good work with the great customer service."}
{"text":"Been apart of my Las Vegas living experience for the last 12 years...down to earth folks serving up just good food."}
{"text":"We are just had a very nice breakfast our server Paul was very attentive explain the menu very well even my special request was made  we've been there a few times first time somebody open up a little bottle of champagne for the mimosas.  \"Will be back\" Terminator voice!!!"}
{"text":"Thankfully food is good.  \"Service\" is horrible. Ignored for 15 minutes and then Ash H disappeared.  Like watching grammer school kids run around with zero supervision.    If busy I understand but I'm sitting at the counter watching server after server walk by.  Couldn't wait to make this review while sitting in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I came to this place for breakfast and it was absolutely amazing! This service including our waitress Sophie was impeccable with her service to us and other tables. I will definitely recommend this place again to anyone I come across. In fact it might even be my new favorite breakfast place I'll be here a few times a week!"}
{"text":"*****2011 Entertainment book...buy one get one free meal coupon*******   Was hankering to eat out for breakfast one morning so I looked on Yelp for ideas. As luck would have it after deciding on Egg Works I also found a coupon for buy one get one free meal in my Entertainment book...score!  Wow, I have been missing out. I truly enjoyed my experience!  What we ordered! All was Hearty, fresh and delicious!  The portions are VERY LARGE.  Denver Omelette Cheese, ham, green peppers and onion.  Chicken Enchilada Omelette Sliced seasoned chicken, green chilies, cheddar and jack cheese folded inside, then topped with a tasty enchilada sauce, more cheese, homemade tortilla chips and a scoop of sour cream  ***By using my buy one get one coupon they deducted $15.30 from our bill! Talk about savings for such an enormous hefty meal! We walked out a winner, stuffed and happy!!!!!!!!  Fantastic service and food! The quality can't be beat!  Will be back soon...very soon!"}
{"text":"Always love the food here when I'm in Vegas. ..this is the place to go for breakfast food.  Our server Robert (Sunset Rd branch) was very attentive, friendly & nice. He took very good care of us.... awesome food and great service, the best combo! And we got a free banana walnut muffin with Yelp check in!  :)"}
{"text":"Great banana muffin!  :) spinach benedict was good but too much hollandaise sauce. I forgot to ask them to put them on the side.  Coffee good. Glad they have the flavored creamer (just ask for it)"}
{"text":"The sister restaurant to The Egg and I located on Sahara Blvd, but don't expect to see the exact same menu.  We jump back and forth between the two restaurants depending on what we feel like eating that day.   Fairly standard breakfast combinations of eggs breads and assorted meats, so it's hard to go wrong with the food, but the definite favorite for me is their Banana Nut bread which is fresh made at the restaurant and always served piping hot. The service is excellent, with a lot of the same faces being there for a while now.  Highly recommended for breakfast."}
{"text":"Traditional benny and banana nut french toast. This is a great place for breakfast in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place for years  Just minutes from my house they open at 6am and it gets busy fast."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast!  Good, fast service and the food is decent!  We come here often!  They offer flavored coffee creamer but you have to ask for it...vanilla and caramel."}
{"text":"One of Las Vegas breakfast places it's always busy but that means the food always good there Bram muffin is awesome"}
{"text":"Great spot for a locals home style breakfast. Good coffee, solid breakfast choices, and their potatoes are so crispy and tasty. If you don't wanna wait at Hash House, hit this joint up!"}
{"text":"I live out of town but come to Las Vegas a couple of times per year. I love a good Chili and Cheese Omelet and these guys do it well. I'm gonna make it one of my regular places from now on. Good food and good service in a nice area, with reasonable prices. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Pork chops were delicious, French toast great,  eggs made with many choices of style you like!  Candice is an amazing server!"}
{"text":"Just want to say that you still need to do something about your WATER at your restaurants.   It taste horrible ... On the other hand, some of the best servers around and friendliest ... Even Nicole ..."}
{"text":"Well, Another restaurant going down hill ... Potatoes undercooked, warm bread not toast .. And carbonation out on soda and no one seems to care ... Check this one off the list ... Hope they can turn it around ... Use to be much better and more consistent."}
{"text":"On our 2nd day in Vegas we decided to try this place. Nice big open area. We sat down and had a look over their big menu lol. The staff seemed nice, but our server was a bit anti lol. She wasn't personable and gave us the vibe like she didn't want us there, yet she was polit...  makes sense?? It was like going to a friend's house knowing their mom doesn't like you, but she's nice to you because she know you're friends with her kid... yeah...  The food tho, maaan. The food was good. Big portions and them potatoes !! A bit salty but had a great taste and had a nice crunch to them. Pricing wasn't bad and I see us returning... i just hope we get a different server... sorry !"}
{"text":"We've been coming to this location since they've been open. Service is normally great to good but the last few months had me doubting. Food is always awesome but lately the service have been ok to ehhh... I wouldn't say terrible but going to the fort apache location eventhough we live closer to this one, now their service is fantastic! From the greet to the server, and even the cashier. Just awesome!  Our server today was Bridgette... She was ok but not very welcoming. She made us feel like we were asking her to do too much from the start. We asked her for some French vanilla creamers for our coffee when she came back to take our order and her response was \"ok do u wana order first\"?? And when I told her that we had been waiting awhile and the coffee was kind of getting cold, she gave me an annoyed look and just walked away without saying anything. She then came back and gave them to me and even with the attitude she had I still said thank you only to get no response from her. That's one example and there were more. The only time she actually lightened up like she actually liked her job was towards the end she came to check up on us and handed us the check. Even with that kind of service we still added 20% gratuity since my father is a firm believer of tipping the right amount but I myself had second thoughts not to. My parents and I share our traditional Monday brunch from egg n I to other egg works location and some other breakfast places also. We were not as happy to say the least but we will still be coming back since the food is great!"}
{"text":"Everyone was so welcoming n so nice! Our server Bambi was fantabulous!!! Haven't had a server go above n beyond for everything in a long while n she was super accommodating n just such a wonderful server!!!! We have egg works closer to our house n have gone there numerous times but coming here just made it stand out. Wish this location was closer to our house but will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Cool newspaper type of menu, loved the breakfast theme.  10 min wait and I came around noon. There is A lot of selection ! Nice and cool inside on a hot sunny day.  I ordered the Spinach and Benny, nothing special. I like how they give a slice of watermelon and pineapple.  The banana French toast is not good. Too sweet, it sounds better than it tastes. They need pictures in their menu. I was expecting French toast with fresh cut bananas on top.   Waitress was super friendly and never forgot about us. She was always there to check up on us and it was busy!  Amy L deserves the Disney trip!"}
{"text":"Ashley was our eggcellent server she provided first class customer service and was very attentive to our needs for breakfast. I have never been disappointed by this establishment and wish you eggsisted in South Florida our home. Great job team and she gave great advice for our stay...awesome job!"}
{"text":"Was a little early for work today so thought Id stop by egg works 3 for a meal and to kill some time. I wasnt expecting a good old fashion mom and pop dining experience but that was exactly what I received.   The servers were great, keep my drink filled and always had something nice to say.   The food was top notch and I have to agree about the banana nut muffins. I may just come back and make a meal out of those.   This is just down the road from my office and it will be my pleasure to come back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at other Egg Works and I do enjoy the food here (their served hot Banana Nut Muffin is the Bomb) but today our food was lacking a little. The GFs Egg Benedict was bland and just not satisfying. That may of been my fault for not building up the breakfast here and her craving Egg Benedict for over a week.    My Omelet was good but it seemed like it was missing something; I think it needed salsa or refried beans it was a Mexican omelette after all.  It was the first time I remember having to pay at the door on the way out. I definitely didn't like having to get up after eating a big breakfast and stand in line at a crowded entrance to be allowed to leave. What if I didn't have cash to leave a Tip at the table and didn't want to put it on one of my cards? I'd have to go back to tip and fight my way out the restaurant... It was very inconvenient.   Inconvenient is an understatement for the shard parking lot with a busy McDonalds and a fairly busy shopping plaza. Get there before the rush times and parking shouldn't be an issue."}
{"text":"This place is packed, but they manage to provide good service to each and every single patron.  That's what I would like to think at least.    I had the Plain chicken sandwich, served with potatoes.  My chicken was moist and potatoes were a bit salty, but filling as always.  I like their fruit options, because it's always seasonal fruit that they offer.    This place is like an All-American breakfast joint, with my favorite Hawaiian flare options.  For whatever reason, they usually forget my muffin, but they always make up for it by giving me an extra one.  It's the best I've ever had, in my opinion.  The muffins are fresh, super moist, not too overly sweet and just addictive."}
{"text":"When it comes to early morning breakfast joints in Las Vegas..... nothing beats Egg Works 2! Generally this place is always packed from 830AM until about..... well later then I usually get there but it is well worth the wait.   They have the only home fries in town that they put just the right amount of seasoning on and are just the right texture to line the lower portion of your plate with when you order a skillet and pile it high will all sorts of artery clogging goodness.   My one tip is... get there as early as possible, especially on weekend as this place get packed."}
{"text":"All I need to say is that this is not The Waffle House . This is the go to family breakfast/brunch spot! Those Diablo seasoned potatoes.... all that!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite breakfast spot in Henderson. Great service, food, atmosphere.   I got the Traditional Benny. Super hearty and flavorful with delicious and crispy Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. Everyone else enjoyed their orders and we all left full and happy.   The banana muffins are delicious and are free for first timers. They are so generous and even insist that you can take it to go and it'll still be good. Which is true; they were good for another two days, still soft and moist.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good potatoes and bacon, scrambled eggs fairly dry. Nice hot sauce choices; much better than the usual Tabasco. Good service, and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the Diners we have back on the east coast. The customer service is the best and I felt like they were always there right when I needed them. Sometimes it is a wait, but it is well worth it. As far as the food, it is pretty good. You start out with the banana bread and you will not be disappointed. While I am not a coffee connoisseur, the coffee is on point. I have not had a single dish here that was bad. If you want a home cooked breakfast meal, this is your place!!!!!!!!!!!!  Pros - Customer service, food, selection, prices  Cons - Hours of operation, wait on weekends."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in Las Vegas... Seriously you must go to Egg Works when you visit Las Vegas.   For all military personnel they give you 30% off your total bill    Some of my favorites include; The Classic, over medium with Chorizo.  The Chili Verde Omlette and The Loco Moco!"}
{"text":"THIS IS MY FAVORITE PLACE TO GO TO FOR BREAKFAST IN VEGAS!  we come to egg works every single time we get to vegas.  and we try to get here at least twice on our trips.  everything i have had here is good.  this place has the best muffins too - a banana nut muffin (that you can get instead of toast) with the hugest muffin top you'll probably ever see.  their potatoes are also the best breakfast potatoes of any breakfast restaurant we've been to - they are flavorful and crispy.    the service has always been great and fast, the food comes quickly, and the prices are very reasonable.  if you havent given egg works a try, you def gotta go."}
{"text":"First time here & our table got free muffins . They were delicious ! Everything on the food menu looked delicious not pricy at all. The waiting was about 20 minutes but seem less time. Customer service was great ! I got the groupon deal totally worth it !!!"}
{"text":"Seriously, I'm addicted to this place. Best place for breakfast and brunch outside the strip. I have tried other options and I always return to eggworks. It's super tasty. Perfect for a nice  Sunday breakfast.  My personal favorites are:  1- bacon and avocado omelette.   2-bandito scramble (super good deal cause it includes a choice of toast or banana muffin)  3-Classic Benny (always cooked perfectly)  4-Works scarmble is algo good.    The waiters are always friendly. I go every weekends. The banana muffin is good. The cinnamon roll is great.    Eggworks is like sunday church for me. And I always leave happy."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for rock and roll half marathon. My wife and stopped for breakfast. Waited for a table for around 20 minutes. Service was good. I ordered the biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon also came with potatoes. The potato's were very salty I wasn't able to eat them. The food was ok. My wife had a omelette and it was good."}
{"text":"Awesome food as usual... Our server seemed to be a little over whelmed.."}
{"text":"This place is always great. There menu is big but everything is really delicious. Service has always been great. They're super busy every weekend and always have a wait time but it's well worth the wait. Two thumbs up for this breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Egg works is one of the best breakfast and yummy cafe restaurants in town! Huge menu and always amazing customer service. Their banana nut muffins are to die for, there is something for everyone on this menu!"}
{"text":"I love this place especially their gambalaya and everyone in Here is so friendly. Good environment."}
{"text":"I'm from LA, pleasure kept me on the strip, but business took me off the strip this morning,  and boy am I glad it did.  Also glad I happened to get hungry near this place. Yelped and bam. .... here I am.  I will NEVER eat breakfast on the strip again.  I had a pork carnitas  crepe. ... AWESOME .... banana muffin wa moist and delish.  My entire party enjoyed their food.   DO NOT skip out on their potatoes.... seasoned so good. ... a rare thing at a restaurant.."}
{"text":"Egg Works is hands down my favorite breakfast spot in the Southwest part of Las Vegas. The eggs benedict is delicious, the potatoes are seasoned perfectly, and the banana nut bread is so tasty! It is usually busy so make sure you get there early but it is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Possible wait time if you have a party bigger than 4 on a weekend.  Extensive menu from eggs benedict to eggs ranchero. Do not skip their potatoes. They're very seasoned and tiny.  Portions are normal - do not expect gargantuan mounds of everything like they do at other places.  French toast was really bad. No crisp to it. Not a whole lot of flavor. Disappointing.  Corned beef hash was homemade and good, but it could've used more time in the pan to get the browned crispy bits. Potatoes were large chunks.  Their green hot sauce is really yummy.  Server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Great food & reasonable prices. Sunday afternoon was very busy. All the workers were friendly & helpful. We decided to order to go vice waiting for a table but it took a while to order & get the food. Overall great place to eat but we may avoid Sunday afternoon next time....."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast diner around UNLV! My boyfriend and I grab breakfast here weekly, and we always ask for Ali. She's always super friendly and attentive and remembers our usual order. Food review as follows:  Mashed Potato Omelette: 5/5 My absolute favorite omelette, this is a perfect order for all the potato lovers out there. It's a huge omelette stuffed with garlic mashed potatoes and bacon topped with sour cream and melted cheese, and served with a huge side of the potatoes. I usually get a half order and it's the perfect size (plus it's a little bit cheaper!). I also order it vegetarian style aka without the bacon and I find it delicious!  Banana Nut Muffin: 5/5 A lot of the meals come with either toast or the banana nut muffin, but do yourself a favor, and get the muffin. It's served warm and it's heavenly with butter.  Stuffed Toast: 3/5 I wasn't a fan of the stuffed toast. It had too much cinnamon for my preference and not enough savory to counteract the sweet. To be fair, I ordered it without meat and it would probably be way better with sausage.   Habla Diablo Potatoes: 5/5 These are one of my favorite breakfast potatoes. They're super well seasoned, crispy, and delicious.   Overall: 5/5 I love Egg Works! It's a super cute restaurant with an amazing staff and great food ^_^"}
{"text":"We decided to come to this restaurant and meet up with My Cousins. I loved the set up and the service. The pricing is pretty good for Vegas. The food did not disappoint. It was absolutely delicious. I had the Reuben and Skinny Fries. Next time we come, in definitely going to dig into one of the omelettes."}
{"text":"They made breakfast into new meaning. Every things was cooked perfect and taste excellent with lots of choices. Will be back many more times."}
{"text":"Char was our waitress and she was super sweet and friendly. We got our free banana nut muffin and gave us another one on the house. :) this place has a large variety of menu options for your sweet/savory tooth. We were happy with our prime rib eggs Benny and stuffed French toast, yummy!"}
{"text":"Oh man~~ This place is my new go to spot in Vegas before heading back home!   Arrived on a Sunday (brunch) - this place was packed!! But decided to enjoy our food at the bar. (No wait just sat right up!)  Our server Austin was great! On a note we had the view of the chefs working up there magic... now let me tell you about Chris... he knows his stuff! We were both AMAZED on how he worked up all the orders!  Service here is #1 and please do! get their Banana Nut Bread! (Soft and sweet I had to togo a loaf for my mama!)  Will def be back - Cant wait!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for Breakfast! Delicious food! Great Service! What more can I ask for?  Def a local spot we all should try when in Vegas! Love everything about this place! Also, Oh my~ their banana muffins are my fave!!!!!  TRY IT OUT!!! YOU'LL THANK ME LATER!"}
{"text":"\"Works\" potatoes:  Restaurant supply frozen cubes drenched in Lawry's seasoned salt, then baked.  Scrambled eggs:  Rubbery Egg Beaters.  Grandma's biscuits & gravy:  A thick, dry, spongy biscuit.    Extremely fat-laden sausage.    A very noisy place.  Not their fault, just a lot of loud talkers.    The shop is located in an unattractive industrial park across the street from the airport.    Several screens carry soundless sports & news broadcasts.  These will occupy diners while they wait for their meal.  Our wait was not long.  Free wi-fi is available."}
{"text":"I definitely love this location better then others we been too(anthem) the food is excellent, i had the pork carnita burrito and it was a good size portion, i am literally stuffed. The banana muffin was great too. Plus our server was awesome, he was so nice and attentive, love his hospitality and i cant express how awesome it is that our server checks to make sure we are ok.... if you stop bye, try to sit in PK's side, he is an awesome waitor!"}
{"text":"Visiting family in Henderson. This was our first time here. Amazing service by PK. We got the chicken enchilada omelette. Sooooo good! And the Santa Cruz breakfast skillet. We will be back here next trip! PK, thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"Lisa T. Is awesome , we enjoy our Sunday breakfast  Mashed Potato Omelette & CFS Skillet  Best in town     Today 12/17  Cashier was rude Jaz  Everyone there is usually nice friendly"}
{"text":"I come here often, the food is never a disappointment. Omelette are the way to go here. Their breakfast potatoes are also seasoned perfectly. The atmosphere is comforting and the decor gives me a welcoming feeling. Now the only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because of the staff. Let me start off by saying I always ask for Veronica. Her service is flawless, whenever my friends and I come here we need her to serve us or it just won't feel right. Nicole was also one of my favorites, it's too bad she moved locations. I will have to visit her sometime! But for the few other servers I got while eating at egg works. Their service was not so flawless, I remember a young man with glasses. We had to wait a while to even be greeted by him. Did not refill our drinks till the very end. Also only checked on us once to drop the check. The other server I had was not very welcoming. She seemed to be rushing us the whole time but, when I saw her taking care of her other tables. She took the time to make sure they were okay but not us so much. Don't know why but that bugged me. Overall Egg Works is a great place to grab some breakfast. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We've had great experiences with other Egg Works locations so we had high expectations for this one. On the door it says Best of Las Vegas 2016 and 2015. However, we ordered 3 Mouse Pancakes meals for our kids. ALL THREE ORDERS OF PANCAKES WERE COMPLETELY RAW IN THE MIDDLE. And the best part is when then remade all three orders and they all came back over cooked. They gave us two 1/2 off our meal cards to use and told us we wouldn't be charged for the pancakes. BUT they only took 1 pancake meal off our ticket and we could only use 1 of the 1/2 our meal cards! And they wouldn't allow my husband his Military Discount because we used one of the cards. Absolutely ridiculous! We paid for 2 pancake meals that didn't even get eaten. NEVER AGAIN! I suggest another location before you choose this one!"}
{"text":"Wow.. I was pleasantly surprised!!! My hubby and I went here after purchasing a groupon. When we walked in, it just looked like a regular old place... to my surprise it wasn't. The food was good and the service EVEN better!! We will be back for sure!! Our waitress was Christina S. She was amazing!! Very friendly and helpful!!"}
{"text":"LuAnna was a great server and was amazing with my kids. The food was awesome must try the Cali crepe."}
{"text":"We are really blessed with so many great breakfast options in Henderson and Egg Works is at the top of the list. I love the simple wood floor and wood panel decor.   The breakfast menu offers something for everyone. Egg dishes, waffles, pancakes, french toast, skillets, omelets and even some Hawaiian favorites like loco moco. This is not a place for those on a diet, the portions are huge. Most egg dishes were made with 4 eggs so take your cholesterol meds.   We went with the cabo breakfast burrito (plenty for 2 to share) and the bacon maple stuffed french toast. The burrito was huge and came with their habla diablo potatoes which are a little on the spicy side. The french toast was stuffed with bacon and maple flavored cream cheese and topped with pecans. Both were very good.   Service started off a little slow with waiting quite some time for our order to be taken as well as for our food. This will be a definite return for me with so many different options to try."}
{"text":"Just got off plane after a five hour flight and found directions to this place on Yelp . Staff very friendly makes out of towhees feel at home . Meal was well worth the price and delicious ... Thank you to perry our server for the great customer service"}
{"text":"Awesome service from beginning to end. From the host seating us pretty quick with updates on our table to our super friendly server offering us the banana nut muffins although I ordered sourdough toast. She said that we had to try their muffins. That was really nice of her and she was right. The banana nut muffins buttered with their Grassland butter, was HEAVEN! The muffin was warm and the butter melted immediately and was a nice salty bite.   I ordered the corned beef hash with a side of their seasoned potatoes and sourdough toast. The corned beef hash was made fresh, not from a can according to our server. The hash was on point. The potatoes were crispy and had a seasoning that was similar to BBQ."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Egg Works on Sunset. The service was great and it had a fun atmosphere. We all ordered the Veggie Benny, mine came with an egg shell in it. The shell itself was pretty big. I was hesitant to tell the server because I hate complaining but my group insisted that I did. She was super wonderful about it. She comped my meal and gave me a free muffin (it was DELICIOUS). Unfortunately, I did get sick shortly after breakfast. I feel like the sickness was more of a result of my sensitive stomach than anything the restaurant did. I would have given 5 stars for service and food quality. I deducted a star for the shell and getting sick afterwards. I'd totally try it again though!"}
{"text":"I love Egg Works, after a night of partying, it's the perfect place to go to cure any lingering  aftereffects.  I love the eggs Benedict and the biscuits and gravy with the homestyle potatoes, definitely won't go wrong with either, and did I mention they also serve SPAM???!!!  How awesome is that?  I heart Egg Works!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place for decent price. I got the board special - eggs scrambled with Mexican chicken and tortilla strips. Very hearty and satisfying. I would have liked more spice or Mexican flavors, but that's a personal preference. Would recommend to anyone who needs fueling before a day of hiking."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Juan was a great waiter. Food was great! Portions are massive. Clean and friendly! Nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Time: Friday 10:30AM  15 min wait. We walked in thinking it was going to be a much longer wait. Not the case obviously. Very friendly and accommodating. Some out-of-towners like me but mostly locals like I like. Really cashed in on the free muffin coupon. Great muffins!! Oh, and there is a train that circles around the inside and part of the outside entrance which was a treat!!"}
{"text":"breakfast time before the pool!!! cant go wrong with egg works!! we got a killer waitress nicole shes blasted with tatts, super friendly and out going not everyone with tattoos are scary!!   great service and food, the food came out quick and we got seated fast too."}
{"text":"Alright, I must admit that I hate eggs. I know, I'm weird, and yes, I see all of your hateful stares! I have met 2 other people who hate eggs just as much as I do. I don't know what it is, I CAN eat eggs in fried rice,  and I LOVE egg rolls, but I just can't eat eggs by itself. Nonetheless, my husband loves Eggs Works, so you may find me here quite often.   I appreciate that they have items on their menu that doesn't have eggs. Although, I would stick to the breakfast dishes because the one time I ordered a burger, it was very dry and tasted horrible. I usually order Grandma's Biscuits and Gravy. Sometimes they drown the two biscuits in their sausage gravy, but it tastes good and is not too salty or watery. The works potatoes are also very addicting, although I feel that sometimes they give you too much of that as well. It makes me wonder how much  they end up throwing away everyday? My husband loves the Island Favorite because of the Portuguese Sausage, and Egg Works is a much closer drive than going to downtown.   Usually service is average and quick, but our visit today was just horrible. First of all, we waited about 20 minutes for a server to take our order. Second, they screwed up my order. I ordered my usual, and our server said \"it comes with works potatoes, is that ok?\" I replied yes. Then she asked \"would you like to add any eggs or meat with that?\" and I said no. Another server delivered our food, and when I saw my small plate with just one biscuit with gravy, I told her that it was missing the second biscuit and the potatoes. She informed our original server, and although she apologized, she just seemed very confused. Apparently she thought that I wanted the side order portion. Funny, the side order doesn't come with the works potatoes. Also, she should have known that because she asked me earlier if I was okay with them. Really? Then she told us that she wouldn't charge us for it, but she did anyway. Well, at least she only charged us for the price of the side order. We also had to wait 20 minutes for our bill. What a disaster! This was the first time we experienced something like this.  I'm sure I'll be back again whether I like it or not, lol. Hopefully we will get a better server next time!"}
{"text":"Wife and I came in for breakfast Sunday morning. Sat at the bar/counter with no wait. We were greeted by Randi, the manager, who gave us some of the best service I have ever received. Super friendly and helpful. Always smiling, and seemed very genuine.   I ordered the special of the day which was a spinach artichoke frittata. Sounded amazing, but when I dove in, it wasn't all that to me. I'm not one to send things back, ever, but I couldn't even force myself to take it down. Randi was super understanding and took my order for something else. Was extremely happy with the fiesta skillet replacement. Amazing service and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The only American restaurant  that has good loco moco.  Their muffins are great too.  Always busy so you know they're good."}
{"text":"We had a great time dinning here. Our waitress was wonderful. Portions are huge. Food tastes and quality 3* Service 5* Portion size 4* We will definitely come back when next time we are in town."}
{"text":"We LOVE the VIBE that this place gives the PORTIONS are huge and  super filling I suggest to go with the banana nut muffin and the bacon avocado omelet and the half order of cream cheese French toast .... best part is that they have FLAVORED CREAMERS ....."}
{"text":"I usually work nights, so breakfast for me is usually lunch for most people. That being said, on the rare occasions that I'm up before 11am, I get a little excited to eat breakfast foods, and usually, Eggworks is my to-go place.   As their name suggests, they serve typical breakfast faire; omelets, breakfast meats and egg plates, waffles, pancakes, etc., but most of their menu is centralized around the always versatile protein.   My personal favorites are the scrambles, specifically 'The Works' scramble, which is a medley of 3 scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, sausage, mushroom, onions and bell peppers. Simplicity wins here at Eggworks, and their consistency of the quality of food is what keeps me a returning customer. They also give you an option of toast or banana nut muffin with your meal, but I have to urge you to opt for the muffin, it is mighty tasty.   Service has been good up to date, and it can get very busy during primetime breakfast hours, especially Sunday.   So if you're in the area, ignore the national franchise pancake houses and diners and come here, it works."}
{"text":"Egg Works, is one of are favorite places for breakfast. My wife had the chicken fried steak skillet ***** and I had  Grandmas biscuit and gravy ****. Which is basically, the Country Benny ***** with the eggs on the side and potatoes. I think our waitress was new. Just a few little things."}
{"text":"We park in a lot of a semi-shopping center that looks as if it's prime was in the late 80's and early 90's maybe, and is now a bit run down. We see a tacky \"Egg Works\" sign, and to me it looked like one of those restaurants that tries really hard, but just isn't that good. However, according to Yelp, it's a pretty good place, and so we walk in. We are greeted by tacky decor - it's a pseudo country-farm experience with the tables and newspaper menu - the theme is apparent, but the aesthetic and curb appeal just aren't all the way there yet.  A group of three, we get seated in a nice, comfy booth, which is terrific after a 10hour overnight drive. Named appropriately, they have the works when it comes to dishes with eggs. We peruse the extensive newspaper menu of everything from pancakes, waffles, french toast, omelets, eggs benedict, scrambles, skillets, crepes, salads, burgers, and even an egg substitute, if you don't like eggs but chose to eat at a restaurant called Egg Works...  Anyway, we make our decision. A skillet, and omelet, and country fried steak and eggs. We get all sorts of options for toast, and are greeted with bright and friendly service.  Overall, a good breakfast experience. It was the only full and solid meal we ended up having that day, and it was filling. You are certainly breaking fast with a meal at Egg Works. Anything you order is one hell of a meal!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast food and service I've gotten in a long time! Oscar was our waiter and he was excellent! I Haven't had that kind of A+ service in a long time. Food is excellent, tight run ship and did I mention Oscar was awesome! Good service is all about the details and Oscars got it covered. Hot coffee left on table, all the food was good. Something different on every TV, Including Fox News."}
{"text":"Worth a trip off the strip for generous portions of breakfast grub.  Kids loved the Mickey Mouse pancake and I loved the French toast sandwich w eggs and cheese.  Real winner was the seasoned potatoes!"}
{"text":"egg works lives up to the chains rep . but i ate at the counter which i dont like because the staff always bullshits by the line and i hate it when i hear other resturants gossip and rif raf sucks but other then that my eggs where eggs my toast was toasted and my coffee was hot cant ask for more from a breakfast place"}
{"text":"Jessi is our server.   My family and I have been long time customers at egg works. My ultimate favorite ranges from the classic \"the works\" to their skillet and the feel good classic \"California crepe\"!   U can never go wrong with egg works!"}
{"text":"We had an EGGcellent experience at Egg Works. The food was amazing the portions were huge and the service was amazing! Big Thank you to PK for his amazing service"}
{"text":"Cordon Blue Skillet was amazing! The banana nut muffin was a delicious start. My families main spot for breakfast in Vegas. Staff was friendly and service was accurate. Good vibes."}
{"text":"Food is great. Had the Loco Moco (a Hawaiian favorite). Banana nut muffins are the bomb. Server was awesome! Thanks Kat!"}
{"text":"The waiter was friendly, but kept messing up the order.  When the food came my husband asked three times for a side of salsa and never received it.  The hash browns were basically McDonald's hash browns.  The Sundance omelette was ok.  Coffee was excellent.  The hostess and waiter were all very friendly."}
{"text":"Yummy husband had a California crepe biscuits and gravy and I went basic waffle and eggs .. all good"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about this place.  Food, fair to good.  Prices, decent to slightly high.  Ambience, pretty basic.  Service, not so good.    The place was packed, especially for late Friday morning.  Does anyone work?  I know I don't, but geez, where did all of these people come from?  And dressed like they just rolled out of bed or were going to go wash their cars after getting a bite.  It's a casual place.  The hostess was very pleasant, but it did take awhile for two of us (place a baby) to get seated.  There were tables vacant, but not cleared.  It took a bit of time before anyone came and cleared and set a table (they were very busy and busers were working hard, but maybe they needed more busers).  Took awhile before we saw our server.  He didn't seem too happy to wait on us.  We asked for a side of raisins for the baby and an order of unseasoned french fries.  We asked to have the raisins and french fries come out first.  He said he was going right then to get that raisins but that the french fires would have to come out with the omelette.  We did ask for the fries to be unseasoned, so maybe that added to the cook time, but what happened to getting kids' meals first (I don't see places doing this anymore)?  And a simple, I'm sorry, the fires will come out with the meal would have gone a long way.     We ordered the Bacon and Sliced Avocado omelette with sour cream on the side.  My girlfriend HATES sour cream and can't stand it anywhere near her food.  The food came, took longer than I would have liked or expected, and your guessed it, the sour cream was dolloped right on top and center of the omelette.  We were also not brought an extra plate despite stating that we were going to share a meal.  When we asked our server for another plate, once he finally re-appered, it seemed like a major inconvenience and like an over the top request to get an extra plate.  So, the omelette was pretty good, but no great shakes.  Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes, again, pretty good, but nothing special.  I did appreciate the cleanliness of the restaurant and it was noisy but not in a bad way (so very good to have a cranky baby with us).  Food was good quality and I liked the variety of the menu.  I noticed they had savory crepes and some Hawaiian dishes.  It was nice to see these.  The crepes looked fabulous, but I was disappointed that they did not offer any sweet or fruit crepes.  I will definitely go back and try some other times, but I am by no means rushing on in."}
{"text":"Why not 5 stars?  Everything was very good, 5 stars says as good as it gets, which would need be exceptional.  With that out of the way, let me say it's hard to beat this place for normal breakfast grub.  I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs skillet.  Christopher was working the counter, very quick, efficient, and just the right amount of friendly professionalism.  The corned beef was very good, shredded beef roast/brisket with potatoes and some spices thrown in to compliment the salted beef and the eggs were fresh.  Toast comes pre-buttered!  Which is great!  Normal jellies in the little single serve squares and the portions are large, enough for two in many cases.  The coffee comes with your own pot so you can have as much as you like and it's piping hot.   Don't expect gourmet, just very good, hearty food in large portions.  This place clearly has quite a few local regulars along with the tourists looking for something local.  I'll be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I had county fried steak, perfectly average. Not a very big portion for almost $12. Potatoes are quite salty. My mother ordered the fritata, came out covered in feta cheese, tons of it, even though the specials board listed it as having cheddar jack cheese. They remade it, no big deal. I am not fond of the atmosphere, very bright fluorescent lighting, feels very commercial. Our server Nicole was very nice."}
{"text":"Came with the family-two kids are 4 and 19 months. Very accommodating substituting things do everyone gets what they needed/wanted. Very popular place Sunday so expect a wait. The food and service were both excellent and they happily gave us substitutions, I'm on a keto diet, my kids wanted eggs and pancakes and waffles-they were happy to substitute the normal sides for some eggs. I definitely will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast, huge menu, something for everyone to chose.  Natasha was our server and she was fun and enthusiastic.  Very accommodating too.  I wasn't feeling eggs so much, so I went with a crepe.  It wasn't your typical thin pancake crepe, its more like a very thin omelet.  Still, it was tasty.  I wanted all the sauce on the side and turkey sausage instead of bacon.  I got turkey bacon instead, but that was fine because my spouse said the turkey sausage was spicy and I don't do spicy.  I also wanted my banana muffin ( unwarmed) and to go, but it was warmed and presented to me on a plate.  No biggie, I just packed it in a box to go.    My spouse had the blueberry pancakes with eggs and turkey sausage.  I did think that was slighty pricey at 11.55, however, I did have a groupon( 12 for 20) so it was still a decent value for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great customer service abd the good is good. You'll find whatever you have a taste for on the menu. Traditional American style restaurant. Each time we come we try to order something different. So far, we haven't ordered anything we were not satisfied with."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast-lunch location in Summerlin. Always a great meal with good staff customizing your order in detail. Reminds me of small town breakfast diners in the 70's. Great price for quality and quantity.  Very busy at times, but that happens a great places. Late breakfast or early lunch is a great time to stop by."}
{"text":"First time here at this location, the staff was very friendly, energetic, engaging and welcomed us soon as we entered. We soon got seated was offered coffee and they leave the coffee pincher on the table. I ordered the waffles, cream on top, turkey bacon and egg over easy. My husband ordered the egg omelette spinach, green peppers and onions. The banana nuts muffin was super good. We did not leave anything on our plate and I hardly finish my breakfast unless its good! The bathroom has an Outhouse sigh, that's a nice country touch. Also, cleanliness throughout the restaurant and overall awesome experience. I would of given a 5star but I nothing special to separate from other EggWorks. It would of been nice to ask, if it's our first time, offered their best or favorite dishes to try out. Otherwise, if we're ever on this side of town again, we know that this would be one of our breakfast option to go to."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Stopped by on a Monday and didn't have to wait but 5 minutes for a table. Service was great, really liked our waitress. Food was good but typical. Good portion sizes. Recommend."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast and food was great! I had the crepes filled with Mushroom, spinach, guacamole, and cheese. It tasted a lot better when you add hollondaise. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"Picked up santa Cruz skillet with extra sides of the Diablo sauce before heading to Zion canyon. That Diablo sauce sure has a kick, way beyond my expectation. For an American restaurant, I never expect flavorful salsa but this one hit the spot. They even sell it in bottles. After the savory dish,  my palate was happily dancing with bites of banana nut muffin. I would def. Return again."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. The staff are extremely friendly. Lexi was amazing she was sweet and engaging.  Diana the Manager runs a tight ship. thank you all for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to go to egg works. I have been here before a few times. The customer service was always great. Today however was phenomenal as we met Ashley. She was amazing and her attitude was so refreshing. I will be recommending my friends and letting them know to ask for Ashley at the Flamingo store. you guy's did awesome hiring her and the food was great as always.."}
{"text":"Another food outing with my OG Ryan B and we decided breakfast for lunch was the way to go. We arrived around 12:45 and they weren't busy at all, which is always a plus when I have time constraints.   Service was friendly and our food came out at lightning speed. I got the avocado and bacon omelette with wheat toast and cottage cheese. I ordered the cottage cheese since I really don't like the potatoes they are famous for but I was a little disappointed to find out that they put that same paprika or whatever it is on the cottage cheese so I'll have to make sure I tell them to skip the seasoning on my next visit. The omelette was good albeit a little too much cheese was added for my personal taste. Another thing I'll have to be a little more careful with how I order my meal for the next time.   Overall our meal was good and very basic for a breakfast."}
{"text":"One of the better Egg Works locations. The restaurant is more roomy and less crowded than others and I enjoy the ambiance quite a bit more. Even better, on a Sunday morning they were airing quite a few football games so my fella didn't feel like he was missing out too much by helping me satiate my breakfast food craving.   There was a bit of a wait, but once seated we were asked by three separate servers in a 2 minute period for our drink orders, so I was already optimistic on the service. My fella and I both went with iced teas which they were refilled regularly. I ordered the sundance omelet and my fella went with the quiche pizza. The quiche pizza was tasty, although I probably wouldn't recommend it simply because I would prefer more egg and less dough in my breakfast. My sundance omelet was really good. Cooked exactly as I requested and had lots of veggies and cheese in it. I also got cottage cheese in place of the potatoes. I've never been a fan of their potato spices, so this was a great decision on my part.   Overall, our meal was excellent and we both left full and happy. Service bordered on over-attentive, but I dare not complain about that as I would prefer that to servers who are completely inattentive. I don't see myself becoming a regular here, but with a coupon for Groupon, I'm always happy to come out for breakfast."}
{"text":"I have been to this location on several occasions and I'm usually drawn there because of a coupon. On this occasion, I had a buy one breakfast get one breakfast free (up to an $8 value) coupon from my trusty Entertainment Book with me.   As always, I suggested to my fella that we share a savory and a sweet dish and once again, I was rebuffed. I ordered the pork chops with scrambled eggs, my fella got the sunshine skillet and my mom ordered the classic breakfast with hamsteak. All our food was solid breakfast fare. I have never been a fan of the home style potatoes they serve at Egg Works, so I went with the hash browns well-done. The hash browns were more like hash brown patties, which I was a little disappointed by, but they were actually pretty tasty. My meal was tasty. When we were finished eating, each of us had about half of our meals still left on our plates. The portions are enormous. At this point, my fella finally admits that my suggestion of sharing plates would have been a good idea - victory!   This restaurant is great for breakfast treats, just get there early on weekends or you'll be waiting a while for a table. Service is fast and efficient. I'll be back, and next time I'm getting sweet and savory!"}
{"text":"Great place! The food was really tasty, especially the wrks breakfast potatoes. The biscuits & crazy were magnificent. We didn't care for the bloody marry. The server was very nice and talkative, though she forgot our coffee and OJ. But that was no problem and we overall had a good experience."}
{"text":"Our server Ashley was very nice. She made great recommendations and was very patient when we weren't sure what we wanted. My gf had the works skillet which was amazing. But we really came here for the banana nut muffins which are to die for. We will definitely come back here next time we're in Vegas and ask for Ashley to be our server."}
{"text":"Great family place to go for breakfast.  I used this restaurant to help me gain my appetite back from my food poisoning affair from earlier in the week at a different restaurant.  The wait staff was exceptionally good, great service all around.  Complimentary muffin for new customers as well, so check it out if you haven't been yet!  The eggs were good, though nothing amazing, but the fresh fruit was delicious as was the toast.  They don't cheat you on a hearty breakfast!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and each time there's been a short wait, but I don't mind because this place is worth it and the wait is never that bad.  The menu is fairly expansive so deciding what to get can be overwhelming. However the quality of food is so good I don't think you can go wrong with anything you get here. The portions are on the very large side, so unless you want to pig out or take some leftovers home ask for a half order.  Everything tastes good and is priced very fair and the staff is nice. Too bad we don't have an Egg Works in Southern California."}
{"text":"Tried the new bread bowl. Tasty but the stew  could have been warmer.  Enjoyed the omelette.  Service is always attentive and solid."}
{"text":"During my trip to Vegas, my friend and I wanted to check out food that wasn't on the strip and had great reviews. We were able to get seated at the bar pretty quickly. There seemed to be a long line just to get a table. When we received our food, there was so much of it. We could have probably just shared an order of the omelet. I actually think my parents used to make breakfast of that size for our family of 6 to share (and feel satisfied). It's sooo much food.  The food itself was pretty good. There was a few Hawaiian-inspired items on the menu. I didn't end up ordering them even though I kind of wanted to."}
{"text":"The service 5 stars . Merissa give me a very pleasant experience, I wish I can say the same about food."}
{"text":"All my friends and classmates seem to love this place since, so I decided to give it a try ! I was treating my boyfriend to breakfast and it was our first time here. They place was pretty packed ! But we were able to have a seat without a long wait.   The menu was overwhelming, well for me since I don't know what I want half the time. Our server was nice, BUT I hate how I couldn't order the way I wanted. I wanted to substitute my \"house special\" potatoes for regular hash browns & she made it VERY DIFFICULT for me. So I COULDN'T order the way I wanted to and gave up. Honestly, that a big no-no in my book since I am the customer. She kept making excuses for me to not change it and I gave up trying to tell this ignorant server girl. Def didn't even want to leave here a tip !!!! But she was somewhat accommodating, but I waited a VERY long time to get her attention.  The food was brought out and it was pretty yummy. My food was just okay since I got a simple meal and it really wasn't as described on the menu. But ohwells ! The pancakes were good and my meal filled me up ! So that was good.  Everything was fair priced, food was food. Didn't find anything too special particularly and if only my server kept her mouth shut, then I guess they would have redeemed a few more stars. Haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Good omelet for 12.00 bucks  Service was okay. Potatoes had too much salt though. Breakfast for one cost 16.50."}
{"text":"Huge portions. Ordered the fiesta skillet with chorizo. Dee-lish. Hubby enjoyed the country fried steak. The potatoes are great. Loved the banana nut muffin. Kids enjoyed the Waffles and choco chip pancakes."}
{"text":"WooHoo! is Rite!... this place is great for breakfast and brunch. They offer a large array of breakfast items: pancakes, omelets, corn beef hash and Benedicts and my FAVORITE \"HAWAIIAN STYLE\" breakfast!. (Spam and Eggs baby!!) but if you really wanna try a great Hawaiian favorite, you have to try The LOCO MOCO. Some places try to have there own style of Loco Moco such as special kind of ground beef patty or special kind of rice. Although, the secret in having a great \"LOCO MOCO\" is the gravy! Thank you Egg Works for making the gravy wondeful. Such great flavor. not too salty, not to runny or thick but just rite. Lastly, order the egg over easy on top of your loco moco. you will not be dissappointed.  Other than having great breakfast food the atmosphere is great. Nice and clean which I like. Especially, the restrooms. If the restrooms are unsanitary, than I second guess about how clean the staff is. With 3 adults and 1 two yr. child the cost of eating was very affordable. Service was very nice and personable."}
{"text":"The food speaks for itself, but I can't say the same for the servers. I won't mention her name however this morning our food was brought out by a food runner, and our server never came to our table once to check on us. We needed, napkins, Cholula, and refills we didn't get any. I just hope to not sit in her section next time we come."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted to check out somewhere new for breakfast. Little did we know that Egg Works was the same company as Egg & I which we loved. Pretty much the same menu with a different name.  Country Fried Steak was awesome! The batter was crispy and while the meat was juicy. The gravy was thick and flavorful, but not too overwhelming. Chile Rellenos - it was good for an American restaurant. Banana Nut Muffin - warm, buttery goodness. Free with Yelp Check in! Habla Diablo Potatoes were fantastic! I'd come back just for these.   Service: Good. If you need something, you can just flip the metal egg face to indicate that you need service."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  Definitely going to be our go-to breakfast spot from now on!!  I had the eggs benedict with the seasoned fries and it was so good!  Absolutely LOVED those potatoes and they come with most of the entrees, so definite plus!  Coffee was good.  We really liked the layout of the restaurant and how everything wasn't too crampy walking around and the dining area was very clean for how bust they were.    Can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast spot. The pork verde breakfast is awesome, and my wife loves the country egg Bennie!"}
{"text":"I practically live here on Saturdays, but I can't help but keep coming back. They have a great selection of breakfast and lunch dishes, along with some pizza specialities because of their brick oven. The service is the best part. They clearly have a well oiled machine, especially when handling the huge crowds that accumulate for that breakfast/brunch rush. I still can't find a breakfast spot that handles the morning rush the way this place does. Don't come here without having one of their skillets. They're delish."}
{"text":"Always delicious and gratifying! Stay away from anything that has the Cincinnati chili. It looks and smells like dog food. Other than that, everything else I've eaten here has been delicious !"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places around! All their food is fresh and delicious. Large selection for the health conscious and just great service all around."}
{"text":"Eggs, always perfect every time.  My husband takes his over easy, never a broken yolk.  I take mine poached medium and they are exactly that.  Service is fast, friendly, and efficient.  Side of fruit always fresh and sweet.  We are frequent patrons."}
{"text":"I used to love bringing my family every week but the management and Epoxy made us change our mind. The food was good and the servers are great but the management desided that $54 inepoxy was now worth $5.40 toward $10 in rewards. Itried yo straighten it out with the company management but they turned me off. So we will explore giving other restaurant our weekly business."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants for breakfast and lunch in Las Vegas.  The service is always great and the food is the goods.  I am always pleased to come here either by myself or with friends.  I love the breakfast selection of omelettes but what keeps me coming back over and over again is the Cincinnatti Style Chili or Cincy Chili. You can have it 3 Way (spaghetti, chili cheese), 4 Way (spaghetti, chili, cheese, onions) or 5 way (spaghetti, chili, cheese, onions and beans).  Any \"way\" you get it, it's to die for and just one of many reasons this place feels like home."}
{"text":"I have been to Egg Works a couple times.  Both times I have been it was a busy Sunday morning.  Despite the people waiting, they get you seated pretty quickly.  The first time I went I had Traditional Benny because I love eggs benedict.  I was disappointed.  They were just ok.  Just last weekend we went again.  This time I tried Grandma's Biscuits and Gravy and my husband had the Bacon and Sliced Avocado Omelette.  I was disappointed again.  The biscuits weren't that good and the gravy had a strange taste to it.  My husband said the omelette wasn't bad.  The servers were friendly but the service itself was just okay.  Perfectly ok but nothing great here."}
