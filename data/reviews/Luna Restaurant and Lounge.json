{"text":"We come here when we order a Groupon. I usually get the Paella, which is really really good.... what is expensive the small hookah with one coal for $20. The servers are usually nice but don't understand a lot of English."}
{"text":"Very good food, the best dominican food in town I'll say. The workers are very friendly. I love how they also sell tacos makes the place very diverse. Over all i reccommend this Dominican restraunt. Its the best !!"}
{"text":"I love Spanish food especially from DR and PR so I purchased a Groupon deal.  I ordered steak with onions and it was very bland and tough and needed seasoning.  I asked for sweet plantains and received plain.  Two of the staff greeted me but the redheaded lady at the bar wasn't friendly.  I was really hoping for a better experience."}
{"text":"Last time that i ordered food from this place it was not good.  The empanadas were fried in a old oil and the filling taste bland not like a latin food seasoning.  That makes the empanadas to taste horrible.  The lunch special was ok, with plenty of rice but with only three pieces of beef stew.  I would never go back"}
{"text":"Only Dominican resturaunt I could find in Charlotte. Got food to go and it was okay just a little more seasoning needed, and it took a very long time to receive food."}
{"text":"Very welcoming, service was top notch and the food was outstanding. Even the presentation of the dishes were beautiful. There were two of us and we both enjoyed the dining experience here. Our dishes were bursting with flavor. Kenny and Jose were the cherries on top. Will definitely be back."}
