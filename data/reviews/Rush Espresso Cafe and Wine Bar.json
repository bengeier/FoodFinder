{"text":"Came here in pursuit of a local small coffee shop that ain't Starbucks! It's very homey- the table tops are made out of wood grain and the atmosphere is very relaxed. The cashier is all smiles.  You think there are only three tables but you look to your left and there's a whole other seating space to take advantage of. I came here right before the said happy hour and got a medium cappuccino sprinkled with hot chocolate powder for $3.75 (with tax). I saw that they also offered breakfast items that are similar to Bluestone Lane in NYC, like the avocado smash bagels and avocado eggs Benedict.  The drinks are all under $4, but the price of the menu items seem to make up for the difference. A fruit cup will set you back $5. However, my friend ordered a bagel and it was served on a nice platter. Good service and good environment. Bring a friend and have a coffee chat! It's quiet in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Went here looking for a place to get a coffee, some breakfast, and work for a couple of hours. Started off with a cappuccino and the \"Power Rush\", which is a bagel w/ham, avocado, and...other stuff I can't recall. Very happy with both orders. Ended up working a few hours, and having a cup of the green/mint tea, also good. Friendly staff, good seating, good vibe."}
{"text":"There is not a better coffee place in Charlotte...quality and service is impeccable.  Just wish there was one in the Promenade."}
{"text":"Went there today for breakfast. Got the espresso in a mug, very good. Also, got the eggs benedict panini and pancakes. The panini was delicious and I would definitely recommend that. The pancakes were just okay. If you are not sure about what to get go with the panini.   Haven't tried the place out at night but will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love to sit on the patio with their delicious lattes. The food is good too. Even my husband, who rarely says a restaurant is more than okay, was impressed by the fresh-baked bread."}
{"text":"Looking for a traditional European Cafe complete with the accent then stop by rush espresso located in Ballentyne.The shop has a cycling theme and gasp the Tour De France was playing on the tv. I almost fell over at the mere sight. Not common in Charlotte trust me. This place won me over the minute I stepped in the door. Not the mention the Aussie accent when the coffee is served. Now on the the more important things yes the coffee. This is the best place so far I have been to for coffee. The cold press is smooth and non-bitter as iced coffee should be and the hot coffee is perfectly prepared. I should mention happy hour is from 2 PM to 4 PM where you can get the Java jolt of your choice for half price! That gives me an excuse to sneak out of work and head over to Rush for a quick afternoon break. I have not sampled the foodies but I can say the coffee is awesome. I am a coffee snob and none of the shops I have been to have stacked up to this place. As far as the atmosphere goes the servers are pleasant and you get the periodic how is everything are you satisfied Mate? There is a modern decor similar to some of the shops I have frequented in Europe. I just wish they had those little Italian pastries to complete the package. The only downfall I can see is that they are located in Ballentyne and not close to where I live bummer. Otherwise I would become a permanent fixture similar to the time trial bike hanging in the shop! Oh well guess I can't have good coffee and a close location to where I live. Sigh..."}
{"text":"There are a number of good things about this place but my last visit left a bad taste in my mouth. The drinks are good but decidedly small. Although the menu says the size of a large drink is 16 oz the actual size is actually probably half that if you get it \"for here\". The \"to go\" sizes are closer to the menu but still don't match. Make sure you look at the sample cup/glass sizes in front of the register, rather than the menu, to tell what you're getting. Had the barista acknowledged this when I asked about the discrepancy, I'd probably feel better about my experience right now. But he didn't ... Nonetheless, I'll probably return here at some point because it's one of the few coffee houses in the area that isn't Starbucks. I'll just be more strategic in my approach to ordering!"}
{"text":"Hi, I have reviewed this cute space before. However, now that I am a regular, I wanted to give some credit to the employees there. Many times we are quick to review poor experiences and not the good ones. There will be both because we are not robots and you can not be \"on\" every single time you work. With that said, I noticed a fella with a beard and silly mustache, maybe his name is Alex, always bustin his buns. He is always professional, attentive and pleasant. There is also another fella with a hipster bun, don't hold that against him, who does a great job as well. I would love to say the same for the females but they seem to what to spend their time giggling and pretending not to see customers.  Overall, this place is good and I enjoy when I am helped by either of the gentlemen there. Its hard to fine good workers and honest people, so when you do, hold on!"}
{"text":"Asked for gf breads on all sandwiches. Got it on one. Person who took our order was very distracted during the order process. Our kid doesn't have celiacs, thankfully, so we said her sandwich was fine, but mine showed up with no bread at all. I said, there is no bread and she says, you said no bread. I said no feta, gluten free bread. She says I didn't ask for gf bread for mine or my child's in a very defensive way. She takes my plate and brings it back with the gf bread, not toasted and no pesto on it. Ok, I let it go, but 9 bucks for a lousy sandwich is, well, not worth it. We won't be back here. Anyone want my punch card?"}
{"text":"Best little secret in Charlotte let alone Ballantyne! My new favorite! I feel like I'm back in Europe in local pubs with awesome music, vibe, wine, and most of all proper management and ownership that gets it!!!!"}
{"text":"Their vanilla dirty chai was one of the best I've had; not watered down and bitter like you get at coffee shop chains. Also, the lemon poppy seed pound cake was divine. I'll be making this a regular stop when in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm able to focus on my day and relax simultaneously while enjoying my coffee and food at Rush."}
{"text":"Having moved across town from ballantyne to southpark I found myself driving over for the perfect cappuccino more than twice weekly since discovering this gem. The illy coffee is brewed to perfection and i can no longer stomach a starbucks coffee after tasting time and time again the delicious brew at Rush. The owners are so friendly and I love the cycling decor he has up in the shop. I'm only hoping that a second shop will open up in the future so I can get it daily,"}
{"text":"Great spot, great coffee, great food.  My favs are the Americano, best in town and the breakfast panini.  Great way to get the day going.   Paul and Jenny run a great business make sure you stop by to support a great local shop!"}
{"text":"Went here for a cup of coffee after reading rave reviews on Yelp and I was not disappointed in the slightest. I love espresso and Rush's was the best Americano I think I've ever had. I liked the decor and searing options. The padded benches and low picnic tables are definitely great for a group of friends though. Maybe a board game or two?   I'm only in Charlotte for another month but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food, great coffee, decent prices. Is becoming my \"go to\" local coffee joint. Laid back atmosphere. Sometimes it's a bit of a wait for food, but otherwise no complaints."}
{"text":"Fav place for an espresso. I'm almost hesitant to review it because I feel like it's a hidden gem and I do t want the masses to figure it out!   The large party room they have is super weird though. It feels like you're in an entirely different place and it's so empty when you talk it just echoes really loudly and it's awkward."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, excellent espresso. Free wifi and comfortable environment to sit for an hour or two sipping espresso. Good chai and lattes too, have not tried food but looks better than what you can find at the big coffee chains."}
{"text":"Amazing little place. A place that I would dream to own! It's coffee place and wine bar. I've been only getting ice coffee from here because it's been so hot but last night I had a chance to order a hot caramel latte. My husband had a slice of cheesecake that was good. Our friends said they have great breakfast. We have yet to try but can't wait to go!"}
{"text":"I got a small vanilla chai tea latte to go. The cup was just the right size for me, and it was delicious. The only negative would be that it was $3 for such a small size."}
{"text":"Great place!  Staff is fast and friendly, the store is cute and clean, and they have Great coffee and pastry.  I stop in every time I'm in Ballantyne.  It's a great place for meeting with friends or studying alone."}
{"text":"Excellent little traditional coffee shop, with the added bonus of a wine bar.  Good service, good food and coffee to die for."}
{"text":"I have been to Rush several times and have given them many chances, but I am finally done giving them my business.  The staff here is the opposite of friendly and they couldn't care less about customer service.  Many different times I have ordered and paid for a certain size drink and received one size smaller \"by accident\". Then, when I mention the fact that the drink is the incorrect size, I am accused of being incorrect and the staff gets annoyed at me for having to fix the drink. Lets not forget that coffee here is not by any means cheap. I also very rarely get my latte made with any amount of foam on the top, which is a pretty common signature of a latte. Whenever I come in at busy times, I am rushed through the line in a way that makes me feel as though I am an inconvenience, and my drink is made in about 20 seconds (which is why it tastes awful). On another occasion, I hurried over to make it in time for happy hour (3-4) and paid for my drink at exactly 4:01, only to be told I missed happy hour. Talk about customer service! Overall, I am just not impressed with Rush in terms of the quality and taste of drinks, the attitudes of the workers, and the prices. There are way too many coffee shops around Charlotte for me to keep giving my money to Rush. This place is overrated. If you are looking for awesome coffee and a friendly vibe, check out Javas Brewing, Mugs Coffee, and Fabo Cafe!"}
{"text":"It's rare that I ever desire to review a place. It's additionally rare that remember to actually complete the review two months later.  It's safe to say that my first impression two months ago was impactful.  I had the Australian pie and goat cheese, potato and onion tart. The seasons and flavor... perfect.  There are lots of options (but not to overwhelming) and the servers are friendly and helpful if you can't decide.   The only thing they leave you wanting at the end of your visit is a location right down the street from you.   Needless to say my best suggestion would to open a location in Mooresville or Huntersville/Cornelius.   Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Best cappuccino I've had in south Charlotte.  They also make a great Caffe Viennese, which I've found is hard to come by!"}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee, fantastic people, great location in Ballantyne. I love this place, I can't rate it highly enough!"}
{"text":"Nicely laid out place, feels very Euro. The staff (two of which I believe were the owners) were very friendly, as were the rest of the employees. Made me feel very welcome. I had a macchiato which was very good, then a Panini. The panini had lots of flavor and was a good deal at $7. Wifi speeds were solid (used the Ballantyne Village hotspot) and the outdoor seating was nice. Can't wait to go back here, excellent all-around experience."}
{"text":"The owners of Rush Espresso have definitely set a new standard with cafes in the south. When you walk through the door you immediately feel the contemporary European vibe, which is heightened by the superb customer service and friendly atmosphere. The coffees are rich and smooth and custom made to your preference. The sandwiches/meals are made fresh to order with only the best ingredients..   My top (4) list:  1. The Muesli 2. The Perth 3. The Darwin 4. The Fresh Start  If you are looking for somewhere to relax and socialize, then give Rush a try!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best chicken salad I've ever had. Wish they put more than 2 tablespoons on the bread though for the $8.50. Good service and atmosphere. Friends love the coffee."}
{"text":"Ordered a chai latte based off some reviews and holy. smokes! It was delicious!! It's pricier than some coffee places but I would gladly pay $5 for that bomb drink again"}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in town.  Great cappuccinos, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Friendly service, yummy breakfast menu, and nice tea selection. My personal favorite is the BLAT. I get to indulge with turkey bacon and mayo while pretending that it's healthy because of the lettuce, tomato, and avocado."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this weekend after driving by. Very clean and the employees were nice. You order inside and they serve you, if you're dining in. We sat on their patio due to the nice weather. The coffee was rich and bold, and the first refill was free. The breakfast was delicious and the servings were large for what you pay. I got  eggs Benedict and fiancé got some sort of breakfast croissant sandwich. We both enjoyed our meals and coffee for $20."}
{"text":"I really like this place good staff and selection of a lot of good stuff. The coffee I had was great The espresso I had was great The pastries I had were great The seating is good and the also have the choice to sit outside which is great.  Parking in this whole shopping center is terrible"}
{"text":"Great Coffee and fresh wonderfully prepared food. The new wine bar addition is alot of fun, with a casual but upscale neighborhood vibe, especially on music nights."}
{"text":"This place has delicious coffee.  Their cappuccinos and lattes are perfect I would recommend ordering a large so because the mediums are kind of small.  The owner is from Australia and he seems to be very dedicated to his business"}
{"text":"This is a local hangout.  Tasty treats and great people.  Owners  are always around too.   Love it."}
{"text":"We have a self appointed coffee connoisseur staying us from another country who loves a quality cappuccino. They tried Starbucks and were very disappointed. They then began the quest to find a quality coffee shop that could provide a great cappuccino. A few offered something decent but fell short.  The quest ended when we found Rush espresso. We've been back 3 times and all three times they have delivered wonderful tasting cappuccinos with Italian cycling cafe styled decor.  We haven't tried the food, but the coffee is great."}
{"text":"Comfortable layout, good service, nice atmosphere, great food and drinks. The vanilla/spiced chai latte at Rush is better than anywhere else. There's a huge selection of tasty homemade food between the breakfast and lunch menus and fresh bread and pastries are always out... the prices are very modest and reasonable. Easily my favorite coffee shop in south Charlotte."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee shops in Charlotte! The staff is always attentive, friendly, and expedient. Not unusual to see the owner around chatting with customers. Overall - great coffee, stellar customer service, and cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've walked by Rush a bunch of times, had some great passion fruit iced tea, but tonight, finally tried out the food menu, and I just may have a new favorite panini!  The Perth Panini (named Perth, inspired by Australian owner, Paul) is innovative and different, and although has no meat, would be great for carnivores and vegs alike.  The cibatta is soft and fresh, and inside, a layer of grilled sweet potato, caramelized onions, spinach, zucchini, red peppers, and HALOUMI CHEESE! Love me some Haloumi! (you know, the Greek cheese that usually is served flaming?)  Paul said most of his customers didn't know what it was, but once they have it, love it.   I also got a side salad for $3 which was a nice size.  It had feta cheese, yellow bell peppers, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes and red onion.  No heavy dressing-- really refreshing with the panini.   When the woman behind the counter told me their desserts are all made in-house, I bought 3 mini cheesecakes (before you think I'm a pig, know these are about the size of a Sacajawea coin) for $1, and a mini cream-filled carrot cake.  The cheesecakes were super rich and yummy, just the right size, and the carrot cake was moist and not too sweet.   TIP:  Get a frequent buyer card. After 9 coffees, your 10th is free.    The setting too is modern and inviting-- the owner's wife is also super nice, and makes you feel welcome. Love the Australian touches, like the Australian Meat Pie on the specials board, and the European drinks, like the affogato. (They use Illy coffee so it's gotta be good.) Can't wait to go back and try them!"}
{"text":"Great cappuccino! Quality coffee with expert execution. Takes me back to traveling in Italy. Amazing that the owner is Australian?????  but he obviously knows how to make great coffee beverages. Hope they expand to many locations in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Service is good, wasn't used to it at first.. but please order the Vanilla Spiced Chai, literally heaven. If you order it around 3-4 you get it half off and it is super cheap and amazing."}
{"text":"Rush Espresso is our new \"go to\" coffee hang in Ballantyne Village. Paul pulls a fantastic espresso, or any other drink you want to order. The atmosphere is modern and chic, and a cyclists dream hangout. In addition to coffee, their panini sandwiches are delicious, and the Australian Sticky Cake is to die for as a late night dessert.   If you're tired of the suburban Starbucks and you wish you could get better coffee in a place with a more authentic, European feel, I highly recommend Rush. And if you walk by and see Paul back there making the drinks, you owe it to yourself to go in and try a latte. His are the absolute best you'll ever try!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had some good drinks and delicious lasagna. Steve and Madison working the bar were awesome. We had great conversation and some good laughs. Steve makes an excellent watermelon martini (which Madison recommended) and he had good knowledge of the wine offerings. I will be back next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Best coffee near the office. Their pastries are local and staff is friendly. Parking can be a pain but there's tons of space inside with the wine bar open"}
{"text":"Have always had on par service/coffee here. Food is good.....owner is awesome, staff is great. No complaints any time we've been. Is exactly what the doc ordered every time we go!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice alternative to big box coffee shops like Starbucks or Caribou. They do offer ample table seating with Wifi.  In the evenings they do offer live entertainment, typically a small band or guitarist. The coffee offerings are what you would expect."}
{"text":"Friendly service, good coffee, amazing hash browns. I like my coffee really hot. The americano tastes good but comes out warm. Thats my only complaint. The coffee itself tastes good and comes out at just the right temperature for me :) They also have a truly delicious set of baked goods. After a hike, or run, Rush is the perfect place to treat yourself :)"}
{"text":"We came for a little birthday party on Friday night with some friends what a pleasant surprise!! Live music from Scoot was excellent.  Very up beat and fresh feeling over all.   Food was great! Ordered Pimento cheese assortment (With Bacon was my fav!!) and guacamole was excellent too. Others at our table had pasta, risotto a huge cheese tray and everyone raved how good it was! The wine list was great. I thought liquor prices were very reasonable. Staff was on it!! We did not wait for anything! I would highly recommend this place for a fun night out!! Or even a date night. I can't wait to go back!! Thanks Rush"}
{"text":"Discovered this place a few days ago after dropping my daughter at the movie theatre across the way.  She wanted to find a coffee place that she could go and hang out afterwards with her friend and I decided to check this place out for her.  I almost didn't go in because of the wine bar part and thought it might be too froofroo (is that a word?) or adult.  It wasn't!  It was a really cool, comfy looking cafe that was bright, clean, not too loud and just overall nice.  The seating was plentiful and they even have a hallway to sit in as overflow that seemed nice and bright, crisp and clean.  I was only able to peek into the hallway because it was closed due to some construction work going on but it's definitely a cool place to do some studying, hang out with friends and get some work done.  My other daughter was with me and we decided to stay and have lunch.  Now, I must say I do wish that their menu for both drinks and food was displayed somewhere because we just happened to be looking to see what was left in the baked goods display and saw a stand with menus in them nearby.  We also had to have the cashier look up the prices for the hot drinks because they aren't on the menu and neither is the hot chocolate on the menu, we just happened to ask if they had any. The prices for the food were very reasonable in my opinion, especially since each meal comes with choice of a side.  Score!  We ordered two hot chocolates, and two meals.  I got the Australian meat pie with a side of thick cut fries and my daughter got the chicken pot pie with a salad.  We got our number, found our seats and patiently waited.  Someone brought our hot chocolate over and it was delicious. My only complaint was that it was lukewarm which was a bummer but we still drank it.  Next time I will ask them to make sure it is hot.    The Food:  The food came out in a timely manner and it wasn't a long wait at all.  The cashier said that the pies were made in house, the fries are not (but they were still good).  It was my first time trying an Australian meat pie and it was pretty good but it had a tartness that I wasn't expecting, maybe from worcestershire sauce or something.  No fault of theirs, I just didn't know what to expect.  I brought the leftovers to hubby and he loved it.  The fries were hot and salted nicely and I was promptly brought mayo when I asked for it.  I'm not a ketchup girl.  The chicken pot pie was meaty and very good, though it needed a tad bit of salt but hey, that's what salt and pepper shakers are for.  It was supposed to have bacon in it, I thought, but we didn't see or taste any bacon at all, which was a bummer.  Maybe the bacon would have added the saltiness it needed.  The salad was perfect.  It had mixed greens, feta, roasted red peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes and a lemon vinaigrette on the side.  Both meals were 8 bucks a piece and worth every penny.  Check out the pics.  Beautiful flakey crust, good amount of filing and no skimping on the sides.  We fell in love with the place!  My other daughter and her friend did go over to Rush after their movie and they said they walked in and it was really busy and they didn't see a drink menu or any menu so they left and went to get TCBY!! What?!!  I texted her pics of the food and drink we had there and told her to ask for a menu but by the time they went back her friends brother had come to pick them up so they have a date planned for next week. Happy to know this place is so close to home and I look forward to future visits because it appears, from the yelp pictures, to have different menu choices available at certain times. This will certainly become my go to coffee shop/cafe.  That is all!"}
{"text":"I am always looking for new and interesting places to get work done. After reading several reviews I decided to give this place a try. I arrived at around 3pm on a Saturday and the place was moderately filled. No mothers with strollers or excessive little children running around typical of many coffee houses today.  I walked in and was not greeted by a sudden feeling of euphoria, but I do love the way they designed this place. I ordered the Australian Meat Pie with the pasta salad. SUPERB!!! I will definitely be back and hope to finally meet the owner who seems pretty easy on the eyes. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The lattes are great!  They have a really cute menu for breakfast and lunch and a ton of drink choices.  They even do that cute thing on lattes and make the foam into an image which I always love.  The people are really nice and the ambiance is like a real coffee house/cafe not like Starbucks.  They don't pressure you to leave or anything and there are plugs for you to use if you decide to do work there.  This place is great :)"}
{"text":"I visited here for a late breakfast and found my new heaven!  I had the sausage and tomato frittata and was absolutely enchanted.  The tomato relish on top was sweet and a little spicy and I couldn't get enough. The frittata itself always gooey and warm and awesome. Whatever the potato side was albeit burnt was still amazing. It was served with toast but that really wasn't necessary. I had tea this time around but will try the coffee next time I go in. Staff was amazingly friendly and helpful. Too many good things to try on a first visit so I foresee a return trip to here very soon."}
{"text":"New space, odd communal hallway kind of connected to the coffee shop via door and garage door. Probably will add more food places   The real issue was 8 dollars for an egg sandwich, add $3 more for 2 slices of bacon. Add a Latte and $15 dollars for Breakfast! Sorry that will never happen again."}
{"text":"Yummy coffee and teas! Their salads are amazing. I love that they have an awesome place to set up your laptop and get work done. The place is bustling but not too loud which is nice when you have to hey work done."}
{"text":"Edited review because Rush continues to be AWESOME after becoming a quasi-regular there at the Ballantyne location.  The only downside is the wait on some days.  Every selection I have tried from the breakfast and lunch menu is tasty.  The coffee options remind me of a high-end Italian sidewalk cafe.  Worth the drive. Full-on five-star experience."}
{"text":"Wow. We decided to try Rush on a Saturday at 11am. So, when we arrived they did tell us that it would be 35 minutes for food, so we were prepared that it would be a little wait. Well, we waited nearly 50 minutes for food, which, by the way only included 2 poached eggs and 2 pieces of bacon that required actual cooking, my husband had a toasted bagel. While we were waiting an eternity for our food, with our 9 month old baby, someone doing maintenance in the ceiling actually asked if we could move so he could put his ladder where our table was. Um no. We cannot. Finally when our food arrived, my husband said to the server \"wow, that took forever\", to which the server responded \"yeah, man.\" Now I know why they ask for tips up front. We won't be returning, obviously."}
{"text":"Spacious, bright and airy espresso and wine bar cafe with nice selection menu for breakfast and lunch. We came for breakfast and had a delicious egg and avocado burger, egg Benedict and avocado toast, Nutella French toast, cappuccino and latte.  Since it's not a fast food place, be ready to wait about 20 to 30 minutes for your food to be ready:(. Overall, it's a nice place to hangout with  nice selections of coffee and wine drinks."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great stop for a coffee, breakfast or lunch. Parking is getting better but still a little tough. Food, service and quality makes this a must stop if you live and work in the area. The sandwiches have a great taste and creative flair."}
{"text":"Rude owner! When I went in I sat at wine bar and it was my first time there. I waited ave waited but nobody came over to greet me! I finally walked over to the coffee area and ordered. Won't be back  Overpriced and just not that great!"}
{"text":"I originally came here to study one day after school. I immediately loved the environment as the staff is super sweet and natural light fills the cafe. I liked it so much i came back a couple days later and grabbed some breakfast & coffee with a friend. The breakfast was really good, a bit expensive but I would say it was worth it. The coffee is pretty good as well but i would especially take advantage of the happy hour they have every day from 3-4. Overall, 9/10!!"}
{"text":"When Dilworth Coffee closed and Rush opened, I admit, I was a little turned off.  I spent almost every day working from there, hosting meeings and chatting with their staff. After giving Rush a fair chance, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The spot got a complete makeover and is now a European, trendy vibe.  The layout is much more conducive to meetings and getting together with friends and the seating is comfortable and stylish.  I would say that Rush is a little pricier but the quality of the food and coffee is definitely worth it.  I'm very glad to see a locally owned coffee shop again rise in Ballantyne!  Paul, the owner, is incredible - Such a personality and is truly grateful for his customers.  He may be running in and out but he always takes a moment to say hello to his customers and thank them for their business.  I give it 4 stars because the barista's are not as friendly.  I'm notorious for going into a new place and asking what servers, barista's etc., suggest and at Rush, I sometimes get a strange look for doing so. I have had wrong orders delivered a few times. I think those are kinks that will work themselves out but all in all, I'm a proud regular!"}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast and some great coffee. Tonight we tried it for some wine and charcuterie which was good, not as great as it is for breakfast though, had some nice live music."}
{"text":"The coffee is still the same, just different location (i haven't been in for almost a whole year). My favorite drink is the Chocolate Hazelnut Martini."}
{"text":"What is that obnoxiously loud humming sound? I didn't notice it at first, but it started to become increasingly annoying while seated and I left as soon as I finished my espresso.   The interior does not appeal to me. The cafe side has unattractive fixtures and furniture. I started to migrate to the restaurant side because it was more appealing but the staff corrected me and asked me to sit in the cafe because I wasn't dining. I felt a little embarrassed and complied.  The espresso was proper, but I won't bother to try and sit down next time."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, friendly service. Good place for a chat with friends or your significant other."}
{"text":"Awesome place. I like a good coffee and starbucks is not the place to get one. I was recently visiting Charlotte and stopped in to have a coffee and use the WiFi to plan my day. The vibe is great here! The staff is pleasant and friendly in a great way. Everybody new my name within minutes and that was something they practiced with everybody that came in. The Music is hip and cool but not blaring and distracting. They have a great food menu too. Had I known I would have had breakfast here, Most important my medium decaf late was delicious. Big props and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Their coffee is so good, their food is ok. I like the location and it's a cozy little place. I'll be back for a drink but I don't think I'll be ordering anything next time from the food menu."}
{"text":"Always a great experience.  I love going in the morning for coffee or in the evening for an adult beverage and dessert.  I've never eaten dinner there, but everything I have eaten has been great.  Love the vibe, the love music and great staff."}
{"text":"Wouldn't you like to grab a nice cup of coffee or tea in a warm, cozy neighborhood coffee shop while either reading today's newspaper or chatting away with your friends or family, or simply just taking in the atmosphere?   This is where you can do just that! I've only tried a handful drinks from here, but the spicy chai tea latte with almond milk is what I LOVE so far.  Wife loves the pecan chocolate chunk square.  They do serve sandwiches and some other food items, but I am yet to try them. Will provide an updated review once I've done so."}
{"text":"I had a mid week brunch craving and found this place. Their caffeine selection is outstanding. Lots of choices and really well made.  I was realy surprised by the food! Top restaurant quality in a small coffe shop. I had the Eggs Benedict that was on top of a heavenly potato hash. I also indulge on a blueberry croissant. My husband was very pleased with his panini and the side pasta salad was delicious. Everything was amazing and the staff was very friendly. Considering the line of people my order came out really quick. I'm looking forward to trying more of the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick coffee while running errands, and I'm glad we did!! My aunt and I had our drinks to go but I would definitely come back here for food or to relax with another cup.   My aunt asked what brand chai tea they use, and we were told they make their own. She was hesitant but said okay, I'll go out on a limb. He asked if she wanted it spicy, and she said no, so he made it \"regular.\" It was DELICIOUS and she loved it. I had a medium roast with sugar free hazelnut. They make their own flavors, and love that they have more sugar free options than Starbucks.   So great. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great prices. Accept Ballantyne corporate card. They also offer a large variety of sweets and food. I love their frappuccinos. Atmosphere is nice. Also offer a happy hour."}
{"text":"Rush espresso is a cool place to hang out when you want to get out of the office and get some work done offsite.  With free Wi-Fi and plenty of seating, this may be my new favorite place to work when I am escaping from the office.  They play cool music and thankfully it is not too loud.    They offer all sorts of coffee  and other drinks, sweets, and sandwiches.   On my visit today, I splurged and ordered a piece of coconut pound cake . Yum!    Can't wait to go back to try one of the breakfast or lunch offerings!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  Great atmosphere, fun vibe.  Friendly staff.  Yummy food. Terrific presentation.  This is the ONLY place in Charlotte where I can get consistently good cappuccinos.  They serve Lavazza.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"This place was a NICE find!!  Breakfast and lunch place. We ate at 11 and tried both menus. Good menu with a mix of familiar and eclectic items. We plan t make this a weekly gathering spot with family.   The best part of the place, however, is their coffee. Excellent selection and really nice brew. Highly recommend this place for a lazy Sunday Brunch stop!"}
{"text":"There is a glint of hope for south Charlotte! A non-chain coffee shop! We're saved!   This place has great ownership. I've met them before, but can't remember their names. Pretty sure one guy is from Australia and boy is he friendly!  This place serves some high-end product. They recently switched from only selling blends from illy coffee (one of my favorites of the commercial world) to a more recent brand called LavAzza. Pretty good stuff.   On occasion, I've even seen a bit of latte art come out of Rush! Not sure who the baristas are, but some of them can actually make you something special. Nice to see in yuppyville.   It's so nice to see some baristas who can actually tamp, pull and pour a decent espresso in south Charlotte. These places are few and far between from Ballantyne to Uptown. Definitely worth asking for something daring, folks. Step away from your cozy and boring triple shot, venti frappucino. Or whatever. This place knows how to make you a cafe latte.   Definitely worth venturing and trying some of their teas as well. They carry a great brand of bright and flavorful teas to choose from.   The vibe inside is a little pretentious but that's a bit expected. It's a little too clean and overrun with non-hipsters. Can't be too choosy, though. It is Ballantyne after all.   If you're in the Ballantyne area, support this local business rather than one of the larger chains. Definitely worth the coin and much more love goes into their beverages.   Get to know the owners as well! They have great stories.   Thanks for existing, Rush. Glad to have a place like this in our neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Wow! I am very impressed! I have client meetings at Starbucks 5-7 times a week.  As much as I do enjoy Starbucks, Rush Espresso trumps Starbucks in all capacities.  It is so nice to see an owner involved and engaged with ALL of the customers. You can tell he is truly HAPPY and that is contagious. I sat here waiting for my client for about 10 minutes and personally saw the owner talk to every single customer and knew almost everyone by name. I love to support local places wherever I go and will definitely be coming to Rush instead of Starbucks, every time I am in the Ballantyne area.  Staff, service, quality and prices are impeccable. Even from the small things of having free water, to having a fun and different coffee sleeve.  I will be back and highly recommend this place.  Support local coffee shops and give this place a try!:)"}
{"text":"I thought this place would be a great place for me to work and gave me the job after an interview, but when I came in to work, the person training me wasn't even there so I waited an hour to even get talked to. They had no structure. I was not even shown the ropes of the espresso machine or anything. They didn't train me in any way, I was left there to watch. I have a year of coffee experience and they wouldn't let me work. After that I got a text from the owner that I was no longer \"fit to work there\" which made no sense whatsoever. I felt disrespected and like they didn't give me a chance at all. The only thing different about this place from any other coffee shop is that they have a bar and get their beans from Australia. It's not that unique. I will never step into this place again."}
{"text":"This coffee shop was my saving grace while getting my nc real estate license while working full time. Never had a single thing I didn't love! I've had all three meals here so many times and the coffee is amazing! The owner has put his heart and soul into this business and it shows! Always my first choice when it comes to lunch and brunch in the area"}
{"text":"Went to Rush a few months ago... My dad stumbled on it and is loyal! Great coffe selection and breakfast is surprisingly delish! Eggs bene and make sure to try the spinach feta balls.. Amazing!  We go for weekend breakfast... A quick ham and cheese croissant for lunch... And late afternoon coffee with sweets! Yum! The Aussie owner makes it a point to remember customers.. Great casual place!"}
{"text":"There is no better place to be in Ballantyne on Wednesday night than Rush. They have a great list of wine/beer selection that pairs with the cheese/meat board. All the while with live performance in the background as you sip and snack. Do get a cheese board, and they don't skimp out in giving the cheese or other pairings!  If you want a full dinner, they have the option as well - amazing short rib sliders, burgers, tacos, and crab cakes that will easily fill you up.   Don't skip out on the dessert either - the molten chocolate cake is cooked to perfection - warm and moist that balances awesome with ice cream."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and unfortunately the quality of service has very much deteriotated.  They have young kids working not only the kitchen but making coffee. Upon arrival today the cash register girl with dirty fingernails and a dirty, wet rag in one hand placed my order and took my credit card with a dirty, wet hand holding the rag. What is going on? The music is super loud that one can not even carry on a conversation They seems to spend time socializing with one another then paying attention to what the customer need. On sitting here and observing muliple people have asked for something not only to be told they would attend to it tirght away and then turn around and continue their conversations for several minutes afterward. I used to see the owner in here all time, where is he ? Does he realize this once great coffeee shop is going down the tubes?"}
{"text":"First time visit and I had a breakfast sandwich which was delicious. The baguette was ok but the rest of the food was just delicious. The coffee was high end and they even gave me the first refill free. I will go back as the food was way superior to most places. If you are into food give this place a try you will go back.  They had a stage set up for live music but at  8 AM I assumed all the musicians were sill tucked into bed."}
{"text":"We came in for late breakfast on a Saturday. I had pouched eggs on wheat toast with a side of fruit and my wife had muesli with vanilla yogurt and fruit. Both were well presented, fresh and tasty. The service is friendly and our cappuccinos were excellent as well.  I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great house blend, great latte's. Nice place to sit and relax in the AM. The parking, as noted in some other reviews, is ghastly."}
{"text":"Service is beyond the charts and the coffee is great too!!!  I have never been to a coffee shop like this where they actually come over and ask you if you liked your drink!  WOW, will be back often!!"}
{"text":"Everything a good coffee shop should be. Good espresso and eats! Was skeptical it could stand up to supposedly \"world class offering in Boston, New York, and Portland on a recent vacation and Rush surprised us as the winner.  Glad to have it for our local pusher."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple of times and every time is a joy, everyone is so nice their place and drinks are perfect specially on this cold weather. If you are not trying to spend too much money then definitely come here. It is a place you can come with friends to catch up and have a great talk."}
{"text":"Friendly, intimate feel and service! Great choices of beverages and food. Only drawback was that they didn't get my order right. Though, I appreciate the quality of ingredients and products. For a quick stop it would be my second choice to Dean & DeLuca."}
{"text":"Best coffee, atmosphere, service, and value for coffee in South Charlotte. Go for happy hour while they still have it. Tables are not super-comfy like in Panera, but that's the point! Sleek, trendy... You'll forget you are in Suburbia within minutes."}
{"text":"We had signature sandwich with a perfect blend of flavors and rustic bread and a fresh flaky quiche and the lattes and espresso were great!  Great place to stop before going to movie upstairs."}
{"text":"I don't even like coffee and this is seriously my favorite coffee shop I always order the hazelnut expresso and it is so the bomb. The owner is such a sweet person and the staff is so friendly. I also recommend a chocolate croissant."}
{"text":"Rush Espresso is fantastic! Love to support locally-owned, non-chain businesses so was very happy to discover this place. The front patio is lovely and the atmosphere is relaxed and casual. I ordered the sausage and tomato frittata and it was amazing... not to mention the out-of-this -world hash browns! They have the best spiced chai in the area and cinnamon rolls are to. die. for. I'm not a coffee drinker but my friend raves about the lattes and espresso. The staff is super nice, helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place! Stopped going to Starbucks after I found out about this place. Also the happy hour rates, everything for half. You can't beat that. I think the timings are 2:00pm to 5:00pm."}
{"text":"Rush espresso never fails to serve wonderful coffee and amazing food. The delicious cappuccinos always make my day. My real complaint is that they have a small, ugly, and uncomfortable restroom. At a coffee venue you should be able expect a pleasant restroom to use after your morning coffee. I might also add that the fake plants should be replace with real plants to add to the over all decor of the new location."}
{"text":"I have now been here twice... Rush Espresso came very highly recommended and I now know why!! I came here on a Sunday morning and the girl working there was super nice and the coffee she made me was amazing!! Blows Starbuck's out of the water!! I could have drank 3 more rather than the 1 I limited myself to lol.    I came back in a few days later after work. They do close at 6pm and it was probably around 530-540ish when I walked in . They had already closed the kitchen so I couldn't try anything there and the guy working didn't seem thrilled about having to make me a drink.  It definitely was not as good as my first one, and he forgot the Hazelnut that I asked for. It was still good but I was disappointed. I know it's because he was in a hurry and wanted to finish cleaning up so they could close up (even thought there were many people still sitting in the store). I will obviously be back again and hope to get the girl I had previously :-)    All in all I recommend this place highly. Everyone raves about the food and the sweets that they have there and their coffee is a really great quality and tastes fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in town for breakfast for brunch for small dinner the best restaurant in town I visit this restaurant every Saturday morning for brunch I love it my granddaughters love it the whole family loves it good job making clean wonderful tasting food"}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review and my first time at Rush espresso. This quaint little coffee shop was the perfect relaxed atmosphere for a business meeting. I had The Vert a la Menthe and if you are in the mood for a nice green tea, definitely don't miss this one! Will definitely be back the next time I'm in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"We have a rather 'fancy' fully automatic espresso/latte/cappuccino maker on our coffee bar at home, so I am not typically one who buys a coffee drink in my own neighborhood...so why do I find myself at Rush at least 1 morning a week and lately, a few times more than that? The location is great! The selections are lovely! Inside and outside seating is a delight and the people around us are either quiet in their conversation or welcoming and inclusive if a tad louder.  Baristas are generally friendly and make a consistently fabulous drink!  I have had breakfast there, it was easily enough for lunch and took it into the office with me to enjoy part II later that same day. The lattes, my personal choice 99 times out of 100, are phenomenal and beautifully crafted!  I'll also say I've not used any app ever that was so effortless to navigate than that of Rush!  I would love for more to be done in this style!  GPS doesn't want you to find this little hidden gem, so be persistent in your looking, though once found, you'll wonder how you ever missed it. Located 'inside' the Ballantyne Village by Mellow Mushroom and Blue Tag, near the theatre area but on the first floor.   Single, unisex bathroom often has at least one waiting person, so hamster bladder clients (you know who you are) this is your warning to queue up earlier vs. later!  They have a half price happy hour in the afternoon and every 9 drinks nets you one free! RUSH on in today!"}
{"text":"Wow. Great atmosphere and so glad to see some bicycle memorabilia on the walls!!! First time here and will be back- staff super friendly and offered some recommendations. So glad to see a coffee house in Char-town. Will be back and can't wait to try the food!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and couldn't believe my luck to find a coffee shop that has not only good coffee but almond milk! Add to this amazing find, they also had gluten free bread. I swear I died and went to heaven. I visited often while in town and found the staff friendly and helpful and loved hanging out here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a mid afternoon pick me up on our travels. We tried the caramel frappe and the iced coffee. Loved the smoothness of the coffee. Not bitter and not watered down by the ice. Definitely a step above Starbucks if we had to choose."}
{"text":"They have amazing coffee drinks that are good to the last drop. Their menu is small. I had the BLAT sandwich turkey BLT+ avocado and it was simple and delicious! I definitely want to go back and try more items!"}
{"text":"Pancakes were delicious, servers were polite and courteous eggs Benedict were delicious on hashbrowns and a bed of spinach no bread!!! the guacamole Benedict a little well done but beautiful display and casual  ambience good with kids and they have outdoor seating if you get there early enough"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm an idiot.  I thought Rush closed down... turns out it just moved across the street.  And man are they movin' on up in the world!  The new place is really the bees knees.  Open, airy, bright, clean, AWESOME.  How did I miss this?  I'm kicking myself.  This is quite literally the perfect place to have any sort of work meeting, plug in solo or have coffee, wine or tapas with friends.  Did you read that?  WINE!  TAPAS!  Needless to say I am going to be a regular here."}
{"text":"Awesome cafe well worth checking out. Loved it! Choices for the health concious and the indulgent. Mmm. The staff was especially friendly and accommodating with requests of information about the menu as well as desires."}
{"text":"I Wasn't too impressed with this place, the coffee here is great and so is the ambience.  The three stars are mostly for that.  We ordered a few things off the menu and unfortunately all of them were very dry.  Maybe I will come back and change the review after trying it again, very open space to get some work done.  It seem like they do have Live Music as well, we went in the afternoon.  Coffee is good, the wine collection looked good.  A place that can be tried again, but I would be very wary of ordering any food."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! The food was amazing, the coffee was great and the ambiance was nice. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This coffee is delic. It's smooth, robust and tasty which we cannot say for the major coffee joints around town. The staff is friendly, approachable, efficient and it's a joy to swing by there. I recently ordered a small drink and they upgraded it for free just bc they are snazzy and nice. It's especially fun to stop by there to get coffee before catching a flick at the ballantyne theater. I recommend this place wholeheartedly!"}
{"text":"I didn't like this Ballantyne coffee shop while my boyfriend was pleased. I think the difference in experience rests in the dessert choice.  We were looking for an inexpensive outing so we picked out a well Yelp reviewed coffee shop.  The ambiance was nice, a little trendy but European.  My boyfriend ordered the coffee, which he said was incredible, and the lava cake. I tasted it and it was delightful.  I ordered a medium hot English Breakfast tea and the last lemon bar. My medium cup of tea was served in a small coffee cup. I felt taken advantage of. Then I tasted the lemon bar.  It was waxy. There was no sharp bite of lemon or flaky shortbread crust.  Again, I felt cheated.  Altogether we spent almost $20 on what should have topped out at $10."}
{"text":"Rush is a lovely little coffee shop in Ballantyne. The cafe area was bustling and there was a consistent flow of people in line.   I had a simple latte and was happy with it. FYI: A medium is 12 oz. They had a full breakfast and lunch menu that looked tasty. The pastries looked yummy too. I'll have to stop by again to sample the food."}
{"text":"Would you like the best coffee in town?  Do you want friendly service?  How about something tasty to eat while you sip your delicious coffee?  Then this is the place for you.  Everything is good here.  The Chai is amazing, the coffee is fantastic, the pastries are lovely, and the BLAT, well it is just too hard to not order it.   I have had nothing but pleasant experiences here.  I used to drive well out of my way to bring my staff their coffee instead of Starbucks!  Keith Haze"}
{"text":"A friend and I each had a BLAT today.  Unfortunately there were two thin meager slices of avocado on each sandwich.  When a bite included the avocado, it was delicious, but there wasn't nearly enough avocado on either sandwich.  The sandwich would have been excellent had there been enough avocado."}
{"text":"Delicious consumables, comfortable atmosphere, reasonable prices. Highly recommended for coffee, a bacon and egg breakfast panini with spicy tomato relish,  and oatmeal reason cookie ($10)."}
{"text":"After a Friday dinner elsewhere, my wife and I developed a yen for a latte and immediately knew where to go... Rush Espresso! They have a newer, more expansive location and it is quite an improvement over it's old tiny space. One thing that hasn't changed however is their great lattes.  The place was packed with diners and those there for the live entertainment. It was a festive and enjoyable environment. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food (varied menu and super fresh). The mochas are phenomenal- perfectly balanced where it's not too sweet, bitter nor acidic and they give you latte art each time!  The actual space is divided into two sections. The main area is very comfy and perfect for meetings and lounging.  The second half is great for working.  It reminded me so much of the coffee scene in New Zealand.  Definitely my new favorite coffee shop in Charlotte, hands down!"}
{"text":"Rush Espresso is a Fantastic Coffee Shop. Superior to Starbucks. The Specialty Drinks are off the Chart's. From what I have tried, the Croissant and Chicken Salad are Delicious!  I have always been extremely happy with the service, the atmosphere and the coffee drinks. The owner's and staff are very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I don't know if I am being picky about my coffee or if it actually is pretty mediocre. Either way it just wasn't working for me.  I'm going to say Rush was a last minute resort after finding out Terrace Cafe nearby had a 25 minute wait for lunch. No thanks we're on a 1 hour timetable and we've already used at least 15 minutes of it looking for a parking space. Along with weird way it's set up where you need to turn onto the street after making a round through the parking lot. For a fun game, see how many Ron Paul 2012 stickers you can spot while trying to find a spot!  The inside is sleek and modern looking, cool I guess. I really prefer warm tones to go with warm coffee and food but that's just me and you can't judge on appearances! The baristas here are friendly and patient while we figured out what to order thanks for that. I settled on a ham and cheese croissant, that was a total disappointment though I probably should've known better when I saw Swiss cheese paired with a croissant. Not exactly my favorite cheese to pair with a croissant but I figured it would be okay. It wasn't. The croissant tasted to me like something you'd buy in bulk at a grocery store toasted up a little and then pressed like a panini so as to kill the airy light butteryness that is a croissant. Ham tasted decent though! I understand that it is primarily a cafe so I decided to get a single macchiato. It was disappointing as well. When I order a single shot of espresso I don't really expect it to come in a huge cup warm and rapidly cooling. No big deal lets test it out anyways. Blech, I didn't realize this but it is possible to have an extremely mild watery tasting espresso shot. I'm not sure about what type of beans they use but it just tasted like a regular coffee to me. At only $2 it's very reasonably priced though!  Return trips? Maybe for the desserts. The staff was genuinely nice and all, I just think the food and coffee is meh. There are better choices around town for a sandwich and for coffee as well."}
{"text":"I love this place! The frapuccino is great and the food is wonderful. Everything is made to order. Good food fast, not fast food."}
{"text":"Rush's has a nice atmosphere, good coffee, and great service. I've been making the 20 minute drive just to come to Rush's since my friend turned me in n to this place a couple of months ago. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I love it!! I love Lavazza and the food is great! This is one of the only places in south Charlotte that I have found that serves Lavazza Italian coffee. Simply the best.  Oh and try the meat pie. Something different but well worth the try. Breakfast is also great!"}
{"text":"Everything a little local coffee joint should be. This place for being in the Ballentyne beast is still cozy and friendly. Awesome coffee!! Food looks great.. Love the tons of seating, inside cafe in small longer tables for groups, in the hall tons of seating, cute bar area at garage doors, and outside!"}
{"text":"First two shots at a Cuban with an Italian!  The Owner (Wife) made for me two different versions (two techniques) for a Cuban Espresso.  My description is that the flavor was more complex than most.  Unsweetened it grabbed my attention!  Sweetened I almost fell in love, which would have been easy to do with the crowd of cools in this place and the Espresso was real good too!    It is still Italian ...\"illy\" is GONE... LavAzza is here now and I could not tell a difference because I did not drink enough \"illy\" before!  This place makes it look REAL Easy to get on my \"Lookalota\" list!  I have been here Late, Early and In Between - This place is NEVER amiss for who I'm talking about and talking to... Maybe my heart will Break... I'll RISK it!  With plenty of outdoor seating and a Cool Modern Interior, it is plenty Romantic and fun even if I'm alone!  My friend asked:  Who drinks Coffee at 9:00pm, and on Tuesday Night?  We were in this almost full shop at closing time!  Some places make it easier to fall in Love."}
{"text":"Chai Latte is the best item on this.   The service is great and it's so nice to sit outside. Great place, friendly service. Had most of their teas, which I really enjoyed, but will particularly recommend Fruit de la Passion.   Owner is very friendly and originally from Australia.   Highly recommended. Great place.  Parking is very easy."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the prices very reasonable.. They have a music on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. Great environment."}
{"text":"Just spent 20 minutes after paying and tipping a rude overweight gal and an inattentive young register lad to get two consecutives coffees - neither of which were what I requested.   After the first mistake I attempted to explain to the rude girl what I wanted and had ordered...she waived her hand dismissively, cut me off from speaking, then proceeded to effectively make the same mistake a second time.   I walked out shaking my head - threw the drink in the trash - after paying, tipping, being treated rudely and dismissively, and wasting a large part of my lunch time.   Never going back. Too many good places to deal with rude service and poor quality product."}
{"text":"Best vanilla chai ever. At under $3 for the largest size they offer, getting out of my car and walking inside instead of sitting in a Starbucks drive thru and paying almost $5 is a no brainer. Super friendly staff, beautiful furniture and deco, great menu and it's always clean. Maybe not the best place to try to study since it's kinda noisy, but there is a separate hallway that's quiet (think Amelie's in noda). They are always very quick when it comes to bringing out my drink, even when it's packed inside and there's a line to the door. Ditch Starbucks or Panera and give this place a go next time you're in Ballantyne!"}
{"text":"You must get the vanilla chai tea!!! It's so yummy! I love it so much that I usually buy two and save one for the next day to reheat."}
{"text":"Great coffee but often out of chai lattes which is my daughter's favorite. They've been out of it the past 3 of 4 visits. We do love the location and quality of coffee, as well as the shopping/spending local aspect so we'll continue to go but do wish they'd beef up their supply of chai because after leaving I still need to take her to Starbucks it's the her only drink of choice  Update: after the owner personally reaching out, I am so impressed that I am updating my review. The coffee here is delicious and our only request was that they hopefully increase their stock of chai. Personally responding to a concern is a great example of why we love to visit local businesses. Also to clarify, our visit occurred a few weeks ago and point taken that I should have been more specific. Thank you for caring about your customers' experience!"}
{"text":"Rush is a real gem! It has some of the best risotto I've ever eaten. The waiter was quite knowledgeable about the wine selection and we ordered his suggestion. Great service and music occasionally make Rush a wonderful place to relax , enjoy and pretend you're in Europe.,"}
{"text":"I considered Rush Espresso the BEST restaurant in Ballantyne Village. . . .until lately. Clearly the owner (who I find VERY rude - I'm talking about Paul, not his lovely wife) has an ego the size of Jupiter and is   A VERY SEXIST. Their food was great but suddenly went downhill rapidly. As a VERY successful Manhattanite, I don't put up with CRAP. His latest sandwiches have almost no fillings, and no I/we don't blame the wonderful staff. It's arrogant POS Paul. You won't find us back there again. . . .overpriced everything & really CRAPPY FOOD!!! DON'T BLAME THE SERVERS, IT'S ARROGANT, INSULTING,CHEAPASS HIM!!!!!"}
{"text":"Rush rush get the espresso! Nice little coffee shop in Ballantyne village. The atmosphere is very relaxing and the staff is very friendly and inviting. I've only had the coffee and yogurt crunch but I look forward to returning and trying more of their breakfast options."}
{"text":"So addicted to this place! Great atmosphere, free wifi, and best coffee in Charlotte! Make sure you go during happy hour (3-4 pm) to get your drink at 1/2 price!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Looking for a late morning breakfast and found this place with the high ratings. Spot on!!! Had the Bacon Jam and Eggs, which is two perfectly prepared eggs atop toasted sourdough with sliced cherry tomatoes. A side of fresh guac and -get this- BACON JAM. WHAT?!?!? Never even heard of it but glad I tried this flavorful creation.  Good vibe, clean store and friendly employees.  This perfect meal and a great cup 'o jo to go with it at a fair price makes for a five-star experience. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"As a regular since the opening of Rush I have to say it just keeps getting better and better!  The owners are always so nice to see, as well as the staff.  The owners really know how to add-on to the beginning idea of an espresso cafe into a breakfast, lunch and after dinner locale.  The eggs benedict and perth panini are my favorite!  The coffee and tea is leaps and bounds better in quality than any Starbucks or Caribou Coffee junk.  I always recommend this place to my friends, go now!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular here during the week since August and would never go anywhere else for my morning coffee. Their latte is second to none. The atmosphere is very inviting and clean. Paul, the owner, is one of the friendliest people I've met and he is often the one making your coffee. If you make it for breakfast, I recommend the breakfast panini, it's a favorite of mine and my girlfriends."}
{"text":"Still love it. Still a regular. But wanted to add that the food is AMAZING. I had the Power Rush the other day for breakfast. Delicious. Avocado, cheese, turkey. I actually might go get one today... Continuing my Rush love affair."}
{"text":"I love the fact that this is a locally owned coffee shop and not another Starbucks chain. But I have noticed that there seems to be inconsistency in the quality of drinks depending on who is making it. This would be my only suggestion!"}
{"text":"Rush is my go-to coffee spot when I'm at the office and can get away for a little while. When you walk in, you immediately notice the modern, European aesthetic: lots of sleek black and metal accented by splashes of red. Most coffee shops tend toward the cozy, which is not a bad thing, but Rush's approach is welcome.  Fortunately, the coffee is high-quality as well (and also European). I have to admit, I didn't really care for the brew when they were serving Illy, but LaVazza is a much better label according to my taste buds.   Two more things I appreciate about Rush: the loyalty punch-cards and the fact that the owner remembers my name, even though I am sure he has customers who are much more frequent visitors than I.  If you're in Ballantyne, Rush should be high on your list of coffee options."}
{"text":"Great little coffee place that isn't *bux.   Been here several times for Lattes and even grabbed a sandwich when I needed a quick lunch. Their sandwiches, chicken salad, and other food selections always look good, but I simply haven't sampled them.  I find the decor to be a little sparse and cold for my tastes, but the owner, service, and atmosphere are anything but cold  Good coffee and good, friendly service. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"I love Rush Espresso.  When I came back to Charlotte after being gone for a year, I was very happy to see the business still open and seemingly doing quite well.  I visited the establishment every day while I was in town and the espresso drinks and breakfast was on par with just how I remembered it.    If I had one criticism of the espresso drinks at all it would be that the lattes really lack a discerning espresso flavor.  I really like a nice balance of sweet and espresso, and I detect more of a cream and sweet flavor when I drink my latte from Rush.  Maybe it's the barista making the drink, or perhaps it just the type of espresso used in the drink, but nonetheless, it's my two cents.  Having lodged this criticism, what I will say is that the flavor is consistent...  So they do have that going for them.    I would encourage everyone to support this coffee bar.  The owner is doing a hell of a job and I want it to stay around for my future visits to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Cute place, good coffee... Usually just get a latte. I try to stop here when I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great atmosphere and even better drinks. The coffee and specifically their cappuccino are fantastic. Definitely one of my favorite spots to come on a weekend morning."}
{"text":"First time reviewer here. I googled coffee shops in the area and this one came up. Definitely what I was looking for, although the wine and tapas made it sound a little dressier online. It has a casual feel to it, and there are lots of fun things to order. All I got was a cortado, which was fabulous but I have had better. I don't think they roast their beans here (nothing compares to freshly roasted single-origin coffee), but they prepare the drinks very well! About as pricey as Starbucks, but tastes better. Very spacious. Good for studying or meeting groups. Free wifi."}
{"text":"I heard great things and went there with high hopes. \"Re-opening has been delayed\", the sign read. Perhaps you need to advertise that fact. I am moving to the Charlotte area and I am very critical. Since I got there at 06:30, it was very disappointing. I had just read an article about the owner and he said something about never being caught in a Starbucks apron. Well, that is where I had to go. Thanks."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte's Ballantyne area!  Paul & Jenn (The owners are extremely friendly and they have the best selection of coffee and wines!  The staff members are also nice and good looking!  Devin even helped me with my car issues one day! What more could you ask for? :)"}
{"text":"The service was amazing! Awesome wine selection. Although we didn't eat, the food smelled delicious. I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Great coffee, breakfast and lunch!   Better than any in town.   I am a regular visitor and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Live music is amazing. Jason Hilliard? Cabernet! They only have one bathroom but the line didn't take long. The salmon and potatoes was the bees knees. I'll be back soon. Specifically for that singer...."}
{"text":"I popped in to Rush this afternoon after a movie, majorly in need of a sweet treat and a pick me up. A Double Espresso Affogato was just the thing. I've been in to Rush a few times, but only just to grab some coffee to go. Today I actually sat down to savor my drink. As usual, the espresso was poured fresh and piping hot. Not sure what ice cream they use, but it was delicious - a perfect complement to mellow out the espresso. Great atmosphere and perfect spot for people watching! I will definitely continue to stop by when I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Finally, an authentic flat white and brekkie!  They will do an avo mash; just ask. Owner Paul and staff friendly and personable. Definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"This is my first review so here goes. I really love this place. The prices are reasonable, and every drink and food item I have had has been amazing. (Iced coffee and pancakes during breakfast are my favorite.) You can order to go if on a time schedule but stick around if you can.   The service is wonderful and the staff is friendly. The owner, Paul, converses with the customers and will also be the first to get behind the counter and help when it gets extra busy, which I admire as not all owners will get their hands dirty, so to speak.   There is outdoor seating available and I enjoy sitting outside as well as inside. There is a wide variety of foods to choose from and I have yet to try all the things that look good. Whether you want a meal or pastry with your coffee (or smoothie) they have you covered.   I also really love that it is a local place. The atmosphere is very modern yet cozy and not too loud. There are plug ins scattered around for those who want to get some work done on a laptop or tablet. I always feel like I belong there and I love the experiences I have had, so definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"So... Maybe I just got the wrong thing? But I got a salad, a large, with chicken. It was $10.75. It's roughly the size of a side salad from Harris-Teeter which would run me about $4.50. It's also got gross brown lettuce in it, so I've got that to look forward to. Plus, the sign out front that says $5 Express Lunch should probably be taken down since there is no such thing as a $5 express lunch. The only thing on the lunch menu that's $5 is a side salad, which I'm guessing would be maybe a cup of greens and a tomato? Not gonna lie, I'm crazy disappointed in this. Maybe their other stuff is better."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that I really love this place.  I have visited often professionally and personally for breakfast and coffee.  My husband, son and I were out to dinner at another place several weeks ago and just happened to pop in for espresso on a Wednesday evening!  We were excited to be warmly greeted with live music and dinning menu featuring tasty snacks to full on dinner.  We ordered wine and dessert and really enjoyed our night!  Our service was incredible and personable.  Excited, the three of us returned the next week and had the same great experience.  My husband and I decided then that we would make Wednesday our date night at Rush.  And so we returned for two more consecutive weeks for our committee to date night.  Once during regular dining menu hours and once during their Wednesday \"rush\" hour.  Sadly for the past two weeks we have had really poor service.  There was a very distinct difference in the service between the first two times and the last two times. Notably the timeliness.  It just felt that there was a disconnect between providing  service and just getting by.  Each of the two evenings had different servers.  Both not happy, not upset to be there but rather just going through the motion.  No smiling or greeting....just doing the job.  Slowly....  This most recent visit we were there for over two hours and it took 35 minutes with empty glasses on our table,  locked eye contact with our server twice and eventually my husband standing up to get our check.  This was confusing when 35 minutes before we told the server that we were done.  Not because she asked if we wanted anything else but because she happed to our table and I took that rare opportunity to ask if my husband wanted anything else.  We both told her we were finished.  No offer of dessert or coffee or more wine.  She said ok, cleared the water and didn't return until my husband stood up 35 minutes later.   No table should wait 35 minutes after beverages and plates are cleared for the check to be dropped.  The restaurant wasn't full,  no one was waiting for a table but she just kept slowly cleaning one dirty table while keeping her eyes down.  Basically,  it was  just poor service.  The food and beverages are great here,  but two out of four visits had poor, aloof, disconnected service.  The visit before the most recent was much the same.  The server was just very slow, never even smiled and didn't inquire if we wanted more of anything or if we enjoyed our dinner until he was dropping our check.  I will still visit for coffee,  but my husband and I are back on the hunt for date night it seems.  Our time is precious and I just want friendly and efficient service."}
{"text":"Rush Espresso! Che bouno!   Love that they use Lavazza. My Café Latte was so delicious, smooth and creamy. Sorry Starbucks but this was awesome. Great house blend too!   When I ordered an éclair and apple turnover, I did not expect them on a plate with syrup drizzled and puffs of whipped cream = nice presentation. Great! The pastries were so good though, they could have easily stood on their own.    Looks like they have a full breakfast and lunch menu. Would have been a five star visit but service was less than friendly; the cashier barely interacted and seemed either sleepy or like he wanted to be somewhere else. The products here are excellent though."}
{"text":"I love good Italian coffee and it's done well here. The owner is really nice and remembers your order fairly quickly which makes for great service!"}
{"text":"Devin makes the best Bloody Mary's in the entire world! Seriously these beauties are beyond perfection - I have lived in most major cities and travel consistently for work but this is my number one Bloody Mary spot. Coffee is on point, food is delicious and staff is kind."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best tasting coffee I've ever had anywhere. Period. They serve LavAzza and the latte's here are to die for!"}
{"text":"I went here with high expectations the place is located in Ballantyne Park a neat area.  The place had a nice coffee shop decor and nice.  I ordered the Ham, egg and cheese on a Croissant it was pretty good nothing amazing but good. I also ordered a Caramel Latte which looked amazing when they brought it out.  So i took a sip and it was cold and also had no Caramel in it.  So I took it back and the guy said I think I gave your girlfriend yours (which he didn't). So he took it back and put Caramel in it and gave ti back to me.  I still could barely taste any Caramel in it but I wasnt going to take it back again.  I will try this place again and pray I don't get a COLD latte this time!!"}
{"text":"Lavazza coffee (no more illy) was excellent with my eggs benedict and homefry cakes  - which by the way were loaded with feta, onions and spinach. A little pricey but would do it all over again."}
{"text":"My review is based on a Saturday night at the bar. This is a decent sized coffee and bar shop located in a mini shopping center in Ballantyne. It's a decent size where half is a coffee shop and the other half is a bar with stage area. On Saturday nights they have a live band. It was clean and the staff were friendly. The bartender is what made this place 4 stars. He was attentive nice and noted he is there most days. He did a great job on our drinks and made suggestions. The drinks were tasty and strong. I would recommend the evening bar scene and can't wait to see what the day time coffee shop is like. Hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is weird. I do not feel comfortable eating here. I don't get the impression that food safety and cleanliness are priorities. The cashier who is always there is strange and covered with tattoos. She acts like the coffee shop is her own personal living room (notice I did not say kitchen) and that she prefers her own squad to visit her there. You can't call ahead to place to go orders (I've tried 4 times) because she/they always take their off the hook.   Update: The defensive response from Paul M. to my write up of my experiences at this coffee shop validates my opinion. He insults me rather than taking the opportunity to make improvements. I have given this place 4 chances and was let down each time. The first time the pastry I got was dried out, the second time the waitress got pissed because I asked her about a Nutella dish, and the last two I had to sit and wait because the phone was off the hook and I couldn't order in advance. So in short, the food, customer service, AND management are lacking. I have other options and will not give this place a FIFTH chance. I have been more than fair! Go kick rocks Paul M."}
{"text":"I really like Rush. Foods good and coffee offerings fill the bill. Why I won't go back is their inability to serve. Today, two gals couldn't make up their minds. They allowed one customer to \"pass thru\" and when he finished one gal put in her order but the other still couldn't make up her mind. I left. I didn't study the situation but I believe that they only have one register? Also,their display case was so fogged one couldn't see what was in the case."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Tired the first time it opened. Great service and good to have something good and we need more options besides Starbucks and dunkin donuts."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop in the Ballantyne area. I went to today with my wife and we enjoyed great coffee there. I ordered a latte and my wife ordered a mocha and it was done very good. I wanted a medium but the barista brought me a small and due to the mistake he gave us coupons for free coffee next time. So we will definitely go back and will try the food next time. Love that they serve Lavazza!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and the couple of food items I've tried are good too. The Sydney panini tasted very fresh. Nicely presented. Unpretentious. Friendly barista & staff. I think the owner is onto something here with his approach. Refreshing in the world of corporate chain franchises. Hopefully there will be enough business to sustain unlike all the other businesses that come and go in the Ballantine village.  Best coffee in charlotte in my opinion. Support Paul and hit rush next time you want a bite or a good cuppa joe."}
{"text":"The only complaint I have is, for a place to be called Rush, they're not very \"rushed.\" If you're on a time restraint, this isn't the best option. They live by their slogan - \"we make real food, not fast food. With that being said, they are delicious and fresh! Made to order, healthy options too. Friendly staff. Great place to just hang out for coffee or wine, grab a bite to eat, and not feel rushed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get coffee! The staff is friendly and the coffee is always wonderful. I haven't tried their food, but I definitely plan to!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Finally a coffee house that's not overpriced or pompous!   The vibe here is cool, the owner rocks, and there are a ton of options!     From 3-4 the coffee is half price, so what's not to love!  Deliciously well crafted drinks in an adorable part of ballantyne:)  I highly recommend trying this adorable cafe!!"}
{"text":"I was pet sitting in Fort Mill and this was the closest option for coffee that wasn't a Starbucks. I go to the Uptown location almost every day since it's by my office, which means I knew I'd like their coffee.   All that considered, it seemed an obvious choice to go here and boy am I glad I did. This location has a breakfast menu with very basic but unique choices. I got a panini with turkey bacon, egg, and Indian chutney. Yum! I also got an iced coffee for a change, vs hot.   The service was really friendly and the vibe of the place seemed comfy and inviting. A nice little gem in Ballantyne, if you ask me."}
{"text":"I went up the road to have breakfast and coffee at Rush Espresso. I've been to plenty of coffee shops/breakfast cafe's and this was by far the most friendliest place. You wouldn't think a place located in Corporate park would be so friendly and comfortable, but it was. The owner pulled a chair from our table, sat down, and began to chat with us. He wanted to know where we were from, what brought us to Charlotte, and all about our coffee/breakfast habits. It was really refreshing to see an owner of a coffee shop so engaged in his costumers, involved in the kitchen, and outgoing. I thought that was really classy.  I'm not only coming back because the owner was so nice, but the food was really good, too. Plus it was super cheap. I ordered their low fat yogurt granola & berry parfait.  My roommate and I split their ham and cheese croissant. It was melt in your mouth heavenly!   I also ordered a latte on the side and it was so good. They make their low fat milk so smooth and frothy. The espresso was strong and smooth!"}
{"text":"Great place to feed your caffeine addiction. Quality coffee, lattes, and tea. The menu is limited. I ordered the chicken salad. Not bad at all, but the sandwich was thrown together and the chips were from the bottom of the bag (crumbled and smashed! Gheez! just open a new bag). The dessert, though a good variety, looked old and stale. There were at least 2 flies on the chocolate croissants. The location is pleasing as you can take a moment to walk over to TCBY or Mellow Mushroom. Also the movie theater is upstairs if you prefer."}
{"text":"Rush is the best coffee option for over 15 miles. Not only coffee, but great breakfast, lunch and night life, wine, drinks, food, all around great place. Live music - check. Passionate, present and friendly owner (Paul) - check. Tons of fresh, delicious options, check. Daily specials, check. Oh - and insane bacon jelly compote (whatever it's called) - CHECK. I wish I could take a shower in that stuff. Friendly people that have been working there for years - check! This place has it down to a science. We should all learn from how they do it. If you haven't visited, and you are within a 10-15 miles journey to Ballantyne, go to Rush, you'll see."}
{"text":"When in for a quick breakfast and coffee, ended up waiting 30 minutes for a simple breakfast panini. Frustrating that when we asked where the order was, they simply said it was lost in the process. Cool environment, but not the best customer service. As much as I love supporting local, we will not be coming back to this restaurant because of the overall poor service from the staff."}
{"text":"I've gone here countless times over the past year, and I have hardly been disappointed. The coffee is always wonderful (my favorite is chocolate hazelnut martini) and according to my sister the chai tea is the best she's ever had. If I lived closer, I would get a coffee from here everyday.   I've eaten more breakfasts than lunches here, but it's great all the time. I do prefer the breakfast to the lunch, I feel like it is more expensive for lunch for the amount of food you get. Most of the time I get the eggs benedict, my eggs are always poached perfectly on top of ham and the hashbrowns, all over spinach which is my favorite touch. The fruit option as the side always has a great variety of different fruits, which I love!   Finally, the owner is very charismatic and always greets his customers with a warm smile and converses with his regulars.   A+ all around"}
{"text":"I'm not one to put negative reviews but this place definitely deserves it. I was told my food would take 30 minutes to come out. Waited over an hour and still didn't get my order. I asked for a refund since the food never came out and all they can said was \"sorry about that\" Don't waste your time coming here. If I can give this place a zero I would."}
{"text":"Chain coffee shops seem to be running rampant these days.  It's always refreshing to walk into one that is unique, has it's own style, ample seating, friendly, helpful staff and a good selection on the menu.  Since I had just left dinner, I only had a drink, but it was FAB-U-LOUS.  If you like iced coffee, give a try to the Hazelnut Choc Martini....sooooo good.  seriously.  The desserts and menu items look great, but I can't give a review on them other than appearance, however, i do believe the mini-quiche lorraine is calling my name....o darn....i suppose i'll have to go back there for breakfast/brunch and dessert sometime, :).....and another rousing round of hazelnut choc martini."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast twice this week while visiting from out of town. The yogurt crunch and light start were both excellent. Also tried a latte and a chai latte. Both were phenomenal."}
{"text":"Can we say slo-mo expresso? Very slow service with staff members who don't listen well or ask enough questions. Also very limited pastry selection for 11 am on a Sunday. Latte was pretty but mostly foam."}
{"text":"Not living or working in Ballantyne, I don't get by Rush often enough. But having been here a few times recently (twice in the last week alone!), I thought I should leave a glowing review.  Almond Chai Latte - get it! You won't be disappointed. I finally found another coffee shop that makes them exactly the way I like them.  I've been pleasantly surprised by the food options. The chef (can I call him that in a coffee house? I think he's earned the title) even stopped by my table to ask what I thought of the sundried tomato melt - I assured him it was delicious & proved it by ordering it the next time I visited.  For a local shop with stellar coffee & food, I think the prices are reasonable.   Parking at Ballantyne Village continues to be a hassle through no fault of the store owners. (Google the drama about the former BV owner who kept the parking lots & won't allow customers to park there... ) Rush has been busy, so I'm very happy to see customers supporting the stores there.  If you're uptown, check out their new location in Latta Arcade. I haven't been by yet, but hope to trek a few city blocks from my office soon. I'm sure it will be worth it."}
{"text":"Best chai tea in the world! Thanks for helping me boycot Starbucks I will now be a customer at rush FOR LIFE. Super awesome owner, great employees, Healthy food, delicious coffee, awesome atmosphere, 10 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Basics first: coffee is good, speciality drinks are good, bakery items are GOOD (give the espresso muffin a try -- thank me later).    Beyond the basics, I love this spot because the atmosphere is great. The staff is always upbeat and helpful, guests are all very polite and generally interacting.  What actually keeps me coming back beyond all that is how amazingly the environment is conducive to productivity.  Every time i go in there I plow through work that I have been putting off.   Caffeine + wifi + upbeat environment ...  adds up to something I can get into."}
{"text":"The chef is the best in town and you should really go here for the best coffee around. Paul the owner is the friendliest cafe owner in Charlotte.   Try the Aussie Meat Pies. They rock."}
{"text":"The coffee is the best! My favorite beverage is the spiced chai latte. The breakfast food is all right, hazelnut French toast was drenched in chocolate and hard to finish."}
{"text":"Rush Espresso is in the former \"Dilworth Coffee\" location in Ballantyne Village. They've given the space a more modern look since Dilworth Coffee moved out.  They give you the option of either having your coffee drink in a mug (if you're staying there to enjoy) or in the now traditional to all coffee purveyors, the cardboard cup. I personally enjoy being able to get my coffee in a mug since it seems a lot less common at most coffee shops.  In terms of the actual coffee, they use \"illy\" coffee and of the half dozen visits I've had to \"Rush Espresso\", the coffee has been great!  I'd definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"We like this place excellent service and attentive the owner and he manager always make a point to say hello to their customers and the food is also pretty good! Live music on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Have to agree with Sally B's review from earlier about Paul and his attitude towards her.  She is a very successful, attractive NYC strong woman and apparently he is not able to handle strong women. Totally unwarranted and offensive enough to cross Rush off our list of places to go.   As she said, not the staff at all, but all him.  Not once during multiple visits did he ever acknowledge her or say anything at all to her, let alone friendly or welcoming.  Enough is enough."}
{"text":"Rush Espresso is a great place tucked into the Ballantyne Village. I feel like I'm in another great coffee house in Seattle. They serve such well made and exquisite coffee and tea. You can tell they take pride in what they do. This is the best coffee I've had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend dig this place! On an average, we go here 7 days a week, sometimes twice a day! In winter I was hooked onto their mint mocha. I also love the Fruit de la Passion tea that my boyfriend orders, which has a very pleasant Passion Fruit favor (I never order herbal teas at cafes myself, but steal my boyfriend's all the time). I particularly love their chai though, Vanilla more than the Spiced. I always order them with 2% milk so they froth more. This place is just amazing! And it is a lot of fun to sit outside, watching the life at Ballantyne Village. The servers as well as the owner are very sweet and friendly too!"}
{"text":"This please is great. I come here often to work or study. Their coffee is excellent and their food is underrated. It's fantastic"}
{"text":"I have been going to Rush for coffee for a few years, but just recently started ordering breakfast. The croissant with egg and Swiss is delicious especially with a lovely latte. Fast courteous service, too"}
{"text":"This place is adorable. I am a coffee addict and especially love a good locally owned shop. I came in here early before class to grab a quick study session. There are probably ten to twelve tables but they do have a wonderful outdoor seating area that is a pretty decent size.   They have great food and coffee (duh!)  I came in and had the power bagel. I think it was called that. Anyways it had ham, Swiss, avavado, tomato, spinach, an cream cheese. What a great way to start the morning! I have had coffee wise two different drinks. The vanilla latte which was so amazing. They serve their coffee drinks in clear glass glasses and do a beautiful little design on top of the foam. I have also had the chai tea latte. I found the chai tea to be a little more sweet than I typically like it so I didn't finish it. They have a choice of vanilla spice or regular spice and maybe I had the vanilla. The location is great and seems to be convenient to everything!! Love this place and look forward to trying every drink they offer!"}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out. Great coffee in the am. Love the vibe with music and wine on the weekends. Don't think I've had a full meal here in a while but we've had great apps, desserts etc.. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Best coffee in town. Never bitter, nice smooth blend. Brought my mom here who is very picky and she loved it too. Staff is always helpful and kind. Love their daily coffee happy hour and new coffee martini. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my first visit to Rush, and I'm sure it won't be my last. With Adam R's affinity (addiction?) to coffee and that fact that he now works in the area, I imagine I'll be returning.  With Charlotte awash in restaurants and coffee shops that revel in their French coffees, a place that specializes in Italian coffees is a fresh change. While Rush very clearly advertises that they use Illy coffees and machines (a well-established provider of Italian coffees and espresso machines), they are still a locally owned, private business - don't let the branding fool you, it's an original.  The coffee is pretty dang awesome. It's light and has just the right touch of bitterness. You can see the owners' little hints of their native Australia mixed into the menu - all of which seems like a pretty good value and branches out beyond just the traditional baked sweets. The names of the menu items are straight-forward and very easy to order.  The interior is very sleek and trendy-modern with lots of stainless steel and bold colors. The patio is spacious with at least as many tables outside as inside.  Can't wait to try them again!"}
{"text":"I ordered a coffee today, and it was cold. I just don't understand: how could you bring someone a cold cup of coffee. I had to request it be put in the microwave. Just why?"}
{"text":"Are you fucking kidding me, Rush Expresso? This morning I fasted before my physical and decided to treat myself to breakfast here. I ordered a Egg and Avo Burger with bacon. I waited for 30 minutes before they realized that they never placed my order, and then, ten minutes later, I was handed a lukewarm lemony, watery mess. No bacon. No apologies.  I loved this place for their vanilla chai, but honestly, this was the worst customer service experience I've ever had. A 40 minute wait during morning rush hour for an incorrect order is completely unacceptable. I wish I could give negative ratings."}
{"text":"Their new location is a lot roomier with lots of seating options both indoor and outdoor.  I ordered the breakfast guacamole benedict and a cappuccino. The benedict was pretty tasty - there are 2 poached eggs on top of guacamole and spinach on sourdough with baby tomatoes on the side. The best part is when you break the egg and you soak up the yolk that runs down the side with the bread. It's definitely pricey for the portion ($12) but it's a good option for a healthy, light breakfast. They bring your food out to you but they call your name once they make your coffee and you have to go to the counter and get it. Coffee tastes similar to what you would get in Europe, but sizes are smaller also."}
{"text":"Came in during Happy Hour and got my drink half price off. It's a great brunch place with a various sandwich/panini options on the menu. They have a plenty of space-good place to get some work done while enjoying some great coffee. I also like their location too. Very convenient and relatively easy parking compared to other cafes in downtown area."}
{"text":"My favorite go to place for a great cup of coffee in Charlotte or to meet up with friends to have a nice glass of vino from their extensive list of wines! Love the owners and their energy. They have become a huge success in Charlotte with more than one location including Piccadilly Cafe!"}
{"text":"I'm bummed that the parking situation could put this place at risk - they're lovely and the service is always above and beyond...."}
{"text":"This has quickly become our go-to place for a good night out. The food and the wine have been consistently good the few times we have been here. They often do live music but somehow we keep managing to miss it but looking forward to going again soon."}
{"text":"Wish I knew this place was closing.  Rode up. No longer there. And I was just here Sunday."}
{"text":"I must be on a quest to find the best cafés in Charlotte because I can't stop checking out these places.   I got a caffe mocha with pumpkin syrup and it was absolutely delicious. They had a lot of syrup flavors like vanilla, peppermint, etc.. When I went to check out, my total was only $1.90! Apparently they have happy hour everyday from 3-4 PM. Drinks are half off excluding those with ice cream and smoothies.   I was a little disappointed because my drink came in a to go cup when I said the order was for here, but the taste made up for it. There is both indoor and outdoor seating, plus strong wifi!   I will be back to try more of their drinks and maybe even some of the pastries too. Sorry Starbucks, I'm coming here now."}
{"text":"I'm going to start this with I am not a big fan of places like these. So many people working and holding meetings , we stopped going to Amelie's because the tables were always filled with people working. That being said I loved this place, the coffee was good, I had the poached eggs and I am going to say they were some of the best poached eggs ever. I hate when poached eggs are wet when you get them, these were dry and perfectly creamy. I had some tea and my friend also ahda meal which she loved.   While there are a lot of people there working, I never once felt crowded by them and actually enjoyed listening to some of the sales pitches I heard.I actually took out some paper from my bag and started to write down some ideas I had for my projects. I can't wait to go back, maybe have one of those ginormous sugar donuts and definitely some poached eggs"}
{"text":"I've never been more impressed with an owner of a business. It shows! Amazing service - perfect lattes - food is prepared with excellence!"}
{"text":"The beet latte is good, and the hash brown burger is delicious.  The \"egg and avo\" burger was okay, not worth the $9, an extra $3 if you add meat.  The guy making the lattes was nice, everyone else seemed too busy, but at 7:30 in the morning on a Sunday, really how busy are you? (We were the only ones in the shop.) I especially couldn't stand that they repeatedly walked by our table without saying, \"hi\", smiling or at least taking away our plates. Who likes a messy restaurant? We asked one lady to help take the plates away, she said she would be back, and never did return. And la piece de resistance... The dirty cup that was available for water.... Yuck."}
{"text":"Great coffee, very busy but cashier seem to keep things moving alone very quickly with a smile"}
{"text":"I go here often because my friends like it. Good prices and great food selection.The Strawberry smoothie was too much milk, not enough berry. I've purchased 2 other coffee drinks but I can't remember what they were... The tea needs an upgrade, PG Tips would be my suggestion. Nice presentation on everything."}
{"text":"Great latte! I just tried their new uptown location in the Latta Arcade. Cool little Cafe. I got a nonfat latte. Generally I have to dump some sugar or more cream in it to enjoy (I'm not a huge coffee person, but still enjoy it), but I did nothing to their cup and it was awesome. Cool design art in the foam, the Barista knew what he was doing. They gave me the classic jab at Starbucks \"we don't burn our beans\" speech. Which is fine, even though I don't think Starbucks burns their coffee; it's just a different bold roasting process they go through. Anyways....  the coffee was great. Price was fine. Will be a regular when I want to stretch the legs and grab a cup of coffee at work."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and the environment is great too, casual, nice music, lots of natural light and the staff very friendly!   Good quality coffee but too sweet, hard to finish ;(  Totally worth the drive from Southpark!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, I love it!!!  The coffee is second to none, and the hollandaise sauce they serve on their eggs Benedict is the best I've ever had in the whole of America...   All the staff are super friendly, and the owner is a ripper bloke, top notch in my books, you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Super cute, would definitely come back! Nice employees, chill atmosphere, good drinks. I got the beetroot latte, and while I'm a coffee fan it was nice to get some veggie-powered energy. It had some nice spices in it, tasted like gingerbread!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I had a fabulous little date night at Rush last night!  The ambiance is lovely, food was delicious, and the service was even better.  We had the crab and asparagus risotto that was incredibly tasty and we split some cheesecake that was out of this world.  We chatted with the GM, Stephen Johnson, for a while and he was super fun and entertaining.  We'll definitely be back!!!"}

{"text":"Had breakfast here on Thursday morning with my husband. As soon as we walked in,  we were greeted and it was a pleasant experience. You place your order at the counter and then grab a number and a it down at a table. Your drinks are followed by food order are then brought to your table. There is a self-serve counter with water and glasses and milk and sugar, etc. That was nice as my husband usually drinks several glasses of water and this way he didn't have to bother anyone for them. There were plenty of tables to sit at and there were outlets and WiFi,  so you could work there.    The food was good and light. The presentation of the food was likely the prettiest I've ever seen my breakfast presented. If you're looking for a reasonably priced and good coffee and a seat,  then you're gonna find that. And,  you can get a yummy and healthy light breakfast that is a little on the pricey side.  If you're looking for a large breakfast to cure you from a hangover or prep you for some intense day of running,  this is probably not the place for you.  Would definitely come back here for a coffee and a light meal. Also,  this is a good spot if you want to have a chat with someone over breakfast/coffee. It's not too loud.  Just depending on the level of privacy you need for the conversation,  you might want to choose a further table from where everyone else is sitting."}
{"text":"I always enjoy having coffee when it's not from the green lady people and Rush does an excellent double espresso. Just as good? The lemon cheese pastry with a side of sweetened cream cheese. Delicious!  I sat here at Rush for about an hour and used a good amount of their wifi while drinking my coffee and eating that pastry. Mostly decent music played and there were several interesting conversations going on that kept me entertained.  Cold morning, so the outside seats weren't occupied and there were still a couple of two-tops available inside. I liked this place!"}
{"text":"When I lived in Ballantyne, I'd end up at Rush as often as possible - steering potential coffee meetings to a place other than the giant green-themed chain. Enter Rush.  Occupying the former Dilworth Coffee location in Ballantyne Village, it's got virtually nothing in common with its predecessor. The space is modern and fairly austere in its appointment. There's a ton of outdoor seating as well.  As for the coffee, they recently switched to Lavazzo, which is fine by me. I wasn't particularly attached to Illy, their original supplier.  The menu is large, offering a wide selection of brewed coffee, espresso drinks, teas, smoothies, etc. Delectable offerings line the pastry case, and breakfast/lunch sandwiches are available to order.  It has more of a café feeling rather than a coffee shop, which I rather enjoy.   The owner is friendly and always goes out of his way to greet customers. Pretty much all the employees are overtly affable. A nice touch.  The usual lovelies: free wifi, no withering glances designed to make you leave your chair after hanging out and working for an hour or two, gender-specific bathrooms, indie music playing...  Prices aren't especially low, but I don't mind. It's worth it, to me. I just wish I lived closer and could frequent this south Charlotte gem more often."}
{"text":"Rush Espresso why have I waited so long to walk in?  This place is fantastic! The people are great, love their accents, and they are genuinely happy to see you. It's happy and comfortable, quiet and relaxing. Latte's are great, desserts are better. I' ll be back soon and often."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the ambiance of this cute little cafe. On one side they have coffee, sweets and sandwiches and the other side they have wine. This is definitely somewhere I would come to hangout and get some work done.  I wish they had a better selection of packaged coffee but I bought a bag anyway to grind at home. The prices are a bit high for the sizes they offer, but it was still a great cup of coffee."}
{"text":"I wish I would have known about this place a long time ago. This is great coffee and desserts. I didn't go to the old location but the new one is nice. Cute seating arrangement. Very good expresso"}
{"text":"The experience I had was such a shame. I went in with a friend and while trying to decide what to order asked the young man on the register if they could do Cortado's (a shot of espresso with a little milk). He asked his female coworker (looked like she was the cook) if she could do a cortado and she said yes. The young man started entering an item into the register, to which I said, \"hang on, I'm still deciding.\" He than recommended I try a latte so I went with his suggestion. My friend ordered food and I even said at the register that I was sorry to make her eat alone. When they brought out my friend's food, they also brought out a frittata. We said we hadn't ordered that and the guy took it back. A minute later the female cook came out and asked in an aggressive tone if I just didn't like the frittata or decided I didn't want it. I was confused and said I'd never ordered it. She said \"Didn't you ask about the frittata?\" I wasn't sure why I was being questioned when I had just said that I didn't order a frittata and no, never even asked about it. She was obviously annoyed as she took it back.  My friend and I were both kind of taken back by the experience. Some time later, I realized they must have misheard me when I'd asked for a cortado. I went to the counter and told the gentlemen that that was the case thinking it would bring some clarity to the confusion. He corrected my pronunciation of how I was saying cortado (by calling it a cortadito - which is another drink but who's counting) but said nothing else. No, \"sorry about our miscommunication\", \"that was our fault\", \"sorry for charging your friend for a meal she didn't order\", nothing. Just the same look of annoyance we got from the female employee.  Maybe I'm expecting too much from coffee shop employees but the place really did seem to be about more than that. The food presentations looked like they did have some real passion for what they were doing, much more so than a normal coffee shop. Maybe that's why it was such a disappointment to leave feeling like I'd been accused by the staff for what was their error.   It's unfortunate that the customer service was so bad when the coffee was good and the food did look great. Luckily, I can get great coffee and great food plus customer service that doesn't leave me feeling confused at a number of other places."}
