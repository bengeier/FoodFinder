{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. Excellent location, nice decor, comfortable seats, and very friendly service. 

Their quinoa salad was ridiculously big. It's probably enough for two people. I liked it but I found it a bit too salty."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The place is filthy, sits old and the place dusty.
I have a meat eater basically a hamburger, it was old and gross bacon was precooked and the mushrooms too.
My friend asked for a pat Thai, the flavor was okay but it was really oily. 
We were waiting over 20 min for our meals and really disappointed. 
Also we sat on the bar and we saw people eating in their station while serving... that's just not right.
We saw a little inside the kitchen, and I couldn't imagine how filthy the kitchen was. 
The service was okay but I definitely won't coming back"}
{"text":"Queen Mother Cafe is like a White American in Asia who seemingly looks like a tourist but then he speaks and speaks the local language better than me, a Canadian-born Asian. But if you've heard me speak my language that's not saying much. Basically what I'm trying to say is that by looks and name, Queen Mother Cafe looks like they serve the traditional Western fare. However, it boasts a pan-global cuisine with Thai as it's most impressive dishes. 

I'm not one to really give this restaurant a complete review because I've only eaten 3 dishes there. And quite frankly, the rest of the menu could blow so hard and I wouldn't even know because I only order (and will only order) 2 dishes: the Ping Gai and Quinoa Salad (with added grilled chicken). I lay in bed at night and dream about them. 

The Ping Gai is so flavorful with the perfect amount of heat. The spicy lime and coriander dipping sauce is wonderful and the meal is incomplete without it. 

The Quinoa Salad is big and filling. I'm not normally a fan of goat cheese, but they execute this dish so well that it would be devastating if the cheese was omitted. 

The Pad Thai never really crosses my mind - I've definitely had better. 

For those who aren't offended by the look of the restaurant, give those dishes a try!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend for lunch. We shared the grilled veg panini with goat cheese, the QM burger and  calamari.

I LOVED the burger. I'm not a fan of chewy soy veggie burgers, which are the norm. This one was nutty and substantial! I am a big fan! I wish the patty was bigger though. 

The grilled sandwich was amazing too. Loaded with the perfect amount of assorted grilled veg and cheese.

The calamari was mediocre. The meat was very soft and good but it was too oily and there was too much batter."}
{"text":"Very poor service and automatically charge tip of 18% for literally nothing. Waitress spilled my drink and her collegue dropped dishes next to our table. Fine drinks and meal, however i suggest something else. Toronto offers much nicer places :)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and got the Ping Gai.  It didn't disappoint and was well worth the 12.95 I paid for it.  I particularly liked the sauce that came on the side that added a sweet and tangy flavor to the chicken and the rice.

I also went here for dinner last year and got a steak off the specials menu.  I remembered it to be good, but not much else about it. Also, the ambiance of the place was nice for dinner since it was dimly lit (you know, it makes it romantic.)"}
{"text":"Have come here 2wice now for sunday lunch and both times been very pleased with the food. Had their savoury corn bread (corn bread stuffed with italian sausage and other goodness) which was delicious, and today i had one of their noodles (chicken with thin egg noodles served in coconut soup) was VERY good. i'm always hesitant of places that have multiple cuisines on their menu (i.e. western and asian) but everything here is delicious and very good quality. If your looking for GOOD food on queen west, u've found it."}
{"text":"Great service, really great food.  I highly recommend the Asparagus Salad.  Also the hot chicken entree...starts with a P??  
I had never been on the patio before (you have to go down the stairs then up the stairs) and it is perfect for quiet Queen Street dining.
I wish they carried Peroni because that's my beer of choice but they have other good options.
3 THUMBS UP!"}
{"text":"I will definitely be going back here! I love the fusion menu and the decor is kitschy but cute. Their noodle dishes are huge but their salads are the perfect size and not overwhelmed with random toppings."}
{"text":"It is not hard to see (or taste) why Queen Mum's is such a local icon.  I ordinarily tend to steer away from fusion restaurants in trendy districts but this might be one of the few places that can pull it off.  Queen Mother is great even if you just have some time before or after a show, get drinks and dessert and/or apps if you don't have time for dinner.  

They have a great assortment of vegetarian starters, including a swoon worthy pumpkin dip that I wish I could spread on every sandwich I ever eat from here on.  The Laotian spring rolls with peanut sauce are also really tasty.  

For mains, the curry vegetable roti is surprisingly good.  The filling is delicately spiced but is nice and creamy.  It's a perfect warming and satisfying comfort food the leads me to scoop forkfuls into my mouth faster and faster while trying to suppress audible mmms.  

Of course, that suppression only gets as far as the dessert case.  Once that chocolate-peanut butter cheesecake crosses to my side of the glass, all table manners are tossed aside, as is sharing etiquette.  Sure, I'll still use utensils but I'll be guarding every bite like an animal hovering over its prey.  You should probably get your own slice..."}
{"text":"Unbeknownst to the outsider, Queen Mother has a great patio in the back (although it takes a bit of a trek to get to it...). Came here for lunch on the first day of official summer weather (finally!) and enjoyed some food and drinks.

Nam Jeun - crispy spring rolls with a sweet and spicy peanut sauce. The sauce wasn't spicy at all (and trust me, I don't handle spice very well) but the spring rolls weren't oily (always a plus) and pretty tasty.
Ping Gai - boneless chicken served with salad and steamed rice. Full of flavour and cooked just right. I can definitely see why this is a favourite!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I've had dinner here a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. I've tried many difference things on the menu- including the Ping Gai, which I recommend- and all of them were delicious!

And they also have a great patio in the back- you just have to know it's there and ask to be seated outside."}
{"text":"I experienced unbelievably rude service at the Queen Mother. After being sent out to the patio to look for the group of six I was meeting by the hostess, I found I was the first to arrive. I asked the waitress if she could arrange a table for us on the patio, which was a third or more empty (the hostess hadn't bothered to follow me back there). For some reason unbeknownst to me, this made her very angry. After being interrogated about who had sent me there and lectured to about how they don't take reservations on the patio (yes, we had the courtesy to make a reservation on a Tuesday night), she threw some tables together in a bizarre and irrational way that blocked access to the rest of the patio. She then disappeared. I sat down and tried to move the tables and a chairs a few inches so they weren't literally hitting other patrons' chairs. The hostess then appeared and rudely demanded to know if I had arranged the tables. I explained the waitress had done so, but that I'd be happy to help her rearrange them in a less disruptive way. She said no, if that's how the waitress wants to do it that's her problem. A minute later she came back and announced she was moving the tables back to their original position. She then set up three two seater tables and informed me that there was no room on the patio and that if we wanted to be seated there, we would have to wait until a group of ten who hadn't even sat down yet finished their meal and left. There were several ways she could have accommodated us, but she didn't even bother trying. She seemed completely indifferent to the entire situation, so I can only assume this type of behavior is par for the course at this establishment. I then went inside and met my friends who were arriving. Because one member of our group was on a tight schedule, we decided to stay and eat inside, where it was quite dreary and empty. The food was good, but not great, and was excessively over priced - real restaurant, not cafe or pub prices, despite the place clearly being in the category of the latter decor wise. One can get equally good Asian fare for half the price down the block and without the bad attitude. We left after eating and had our drinks and dessert elsewhere. Granted, the waitress we ended up with inside was very nice, but after the initial disgusting patio debacle, I will never return. I certainly don't demand palace etiquette, but I'm not in the habit of spending my hard earned money being treated disrespectfully and ungraciously by lazy, surly staff having a bad day."}
{"text":"I am so lucky to live only steps from the door to this surprisingly quaint gem. 
The menu is diverse to say the least. 
The nightly specials are well prepared and do not make frequent enough re-appearances. I guess that's also says a lot to a rotating and fresh menu. 
Last maybe the best desert in the area. 

Thank You QMC!!!"}
{"text":"Well, technically 4.5 out of 5. The Ping Gai chicken is a must have. Their calamari is good too. Just don't order the sticky rice as the bamboo holder has some funny smell ... Service is good! White Sangria is good too..."}
{"text":"The place is a bit overhyped and not  a lot of my friends like it but  I thought the Ping Gai is pretty awesome.  Its the only thing I've ordered"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. The food was good the service was soso. I enjoyed the decor but found the place extremely crowded so I don't know if I would go there again."}
{"text":"I have no idea what everyone is raving about and maybe I don't know what to order, but in the three times I have been to this restaurant, the food has been bland and entirely uninventive.  The dishes are so mashed up in my mind I can't even distinguish them from one another. The setting is cute for a drink but as for dinner, the city has much, much better funky fare to offer than here."}
{"text":"Had the best peanut sauce with rice and a nice glass of red wine
Very good service and nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The queen mother was a surprise to me and my boyfriend who were walking down queen street and were starving. We popped in and it delivered not only fantastic service but good food.
I had the argentinian flank steak and he had the argula and pecan salad with chicken. My steak was FANTASTIC the chimichurri was soooo good.

His salad was good but I'm biased because I love blue cheese.

We finished off with a yummy (huge) piece of carrot cake which was 6 bucks, which made me sad lol.

Overall, well priced. good food. good service. A little slow but that's the way I like it when I'm with good company."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars because the service was terrible however the food was really good. Even from the moment my sisters, mom, and I came in our waiter had a really bad attitude. He took us to a table directly in the sun(when it's 90 degrees outside) and we asked him if we could be in the shade. He looked annoyed and took us to another table. While we were ordering he looked uninterested which all of us noticed. He got my mom's order wrong and when the right dish came, he literally dropped the plate on our table. 
Summary: Food=great 
Service=awful"}
{"text":"Great service, the food is a-ok

We brunched on 
pulled chicken crepes - tons of chicken but I wish it were spicier!
KHAO SOY GAI - a curry chicken soup noodle dish; pretty tasty

Nothing to wow about
but nothing disappointing either."}
{"text":"Like lots of British pub's, the Queen Mother is a surprisingly good place to get Thai food. The back patio is nice and it's a good option on a part of Queen west with few choices. Definitely a go-to place."}
{"text":"Between the Rivoli and the Queen Mother, Im more partial to the former although neither is really my bag.

I warn you now, it gets drafty in there in the winter, but the back patio is sweet in the summer. It's big brunch spot and it's been around for a long time so all the old Queen Street people talk about it like they still go every day.

Locals call it the Queen Mum and they have great booths for an intimate lunch but not a great bar scene if you're looking for something to do later on. Much more of a day spot than the Riv."}
{"text":"Cozy and den like, this place had quite a lot of foot traffic and the menu was ok.  Only serving half menu before 530 however.  Staff were hard to differentiate between them and customers but the male waiter we had was polite and helpful through the entire service.  #TwoEntrepreneursApproved"}
{"text":"Stopped in for Tea & Dessert and it was great. Our Waiter needs to be discovered by Some Talent Agency or something because he was trying too hard to be all funny & cute. 

Once it was funny, Twice it was like we got the message, Third time I just wanted to tell him to \"Shut the hell up & leave us alone to enjoy our tea & dessert.\"

BTW the Blueberry & Lemon Cheesecake,,,,,,,,,Yummy"}
{"text":"Great Food! Nice Atmosphere! Great Location!

Friend of mine wanted to have a dinner with the guys and we decided to go here. The menu is quite an eclectic assortment of meals, but you can definitely find something to your liking. Ended up having the KHAO SOY GAI which is a Laotian dish with noodles and herbs in a Thai curry style sauce. It was amazing. Other friends had different meals and they enjoyed theirs nonetheless."}
{"text":"Tried to love this place because the service was good, location is great, and the atmosphere in general is nice.  oohh But the food.........I'm from Vancouver, I know what dim sum is suppose to taste like!  That rubbery thing that they pulled out of the microwave is not Dim Sum.  Also do not try the noodles there not matter how great it sounds on the menu!  It is not good.  No flavour and very mushy."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on a Saturday night after an evening full of skating. We were looking for a late-night spot to grab some coffee and dessert and Queen Mother Cafe fit the bill. 

The candle-lit space felt very intimate and the atmosphere was warm and cozy (and dare I say a bit romantic?). Our server was very friendly and attentive. He was also knowledgeable about the menu items and made helpful suggestions. In addition to coffee and slices of cake, we ended up ordering the Nam Dip appetizer (3 Vietnamese fresh spring rolls served with sweet and spicy peanut sauce). The coffee was quite good and came with free refills, which was a nice surprise. There was a nice selection of cakes to choose from and the toffee cheesecake I ordered was tasty and filling (free cake refills were not offered, unfortunately). The Vietnamese fresh spring rolls were pretty standard but this dish is waaaay overpriced ($9.95). Oh well, you win some you lose some. Overall, we had a very pleasant experience here!"}
{"text":"Walked in on the recommendation of a local, and we're grateful we did! Place was hopping at 8:00 pm on a rainy Monday night. Tried the Sweet Potato Soup, the Mushroom Ravioli (the special, it was perfect), Arugula Salad, and a Lemon dessert sent from Heaven! Service was great, and the place was adorable. Would absolutely return!"}
{"text":"The food was deffinitly worth a solid 5 stars, with a wide variety of flavors for all types of tastes. Was a very nice environment, and good prices (which is very important to me). My only reason for only 4 stars is that after the meal, the service was a little slow. Waiting for the check afterwards seemed too long considering many waitresses were just standing around. Overall worth another trip."}
{"text":"I loved my dish. I don't think my friend really enjoyed the KHAO SOY GAI, it's noodles in some green sauce. 

I tried to find my dish on the menu but it's not on the online menu. It was some sort of rice dish with Corn bread, maybe a creol dish I can't remember. The corn bread was amazing. Everything about that dish was fantastic.  I wish I knew the name, maybe it was a Jambalaya. 

Another time I came here and had desserts, key lime pie and pecan pie. I also tired their snickers cake. Their desserts are awesome.

Never drank here but noticed how they don't skimp out on the wine and pour you a nice full glass. Also the drink prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been here twice - once on a cozy date and once with a group of friends. And the Queen Mother was perfect for both! Everyone seems to find something perfect on the menu, and then enjoys what they ordered. The ambiance is kind of dim and busy, but not too noisy - it seemed very romantic on a date, and then just fun and interesting with friends. 

It's slightly on the pricy side, but I'd say that's worth it to know that what you get is going to be tasty and nicely presented. The drinks are average price and perfectly good, and the drink list is fabulously descriptive...the best I've ever seen, actually. 

This will definitely be a go-to restaurant for me."}
{"text":"3.5/5. Recommend the kale salad (add goat cheese if you like) and the beet ravioli (special). Always busy so make reservations"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good...for the most part a 25-35 crowd.  Shared the PING GAI chicken and the QUINOA SALAD and they were both very good. The PING GAI chicken had a good amount of chicken (enough for both of us) and overall, meal, tax and tip for about $45 (1 beer and 1 tea). They also have a nice selection of desserts which we did not try.  The seating is a little tight in some areas and the lighting is very bright which creates a nice cozzy atmosphere"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant for the consistently delicious food. The ambiance is a little \"vanilla\" and borderline boring but the food and service definitely make up for it. Tonight we ate the spring rolls with homemade peanut sauce and the arugula salad with pumpkin seeds to start. Main course consisted of Ping Gai (my hubbie's fave) and steak frites with blue cheese sauce. An eclectic menu for a wide variety of tastes. This is a \"go to\" restaurant for us."}
{"text":"I went in for Sunday brunch, and couldn't believe how busy this place was! Even with the number of people, I was extremely surprised and pleased by how quickly they got everyone seated and served. My food was super quick!

I was a bit annoyed with the lack of brunch options without egg - I ended up having the BLT, which while good, was massive. I didn't end up finishing it because of how huge it was.

Most importantly though, the coffee. The coffee was incredible. It was definitely the best coffee I've had since I got to Toronto and I would be back in a heartbeat for another latte. Props on having a proper espresso machine!

Overall a good experience, and I'll be back for another coffee before too long!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always had the amazing Pad Thai. My friends have had other things, and none of them spectacular, but the Pad Thai was AMAZING. None of that over-ketchuped nonsense here, Queen Mother's Thai chef makes a really good Pad Thai. The sauce was really good, tamarind with a hint of peanut. Large pieces of chicken and shrimp and fried egg goodness. The Pad Thai comes in three levels of spiciness, but even the most spicy one doesn't take away from the flavour. 

Another must-try is the calamari -- crispy on the outside and really tender on the inside. I've always had calamari with tzaziki, but Queen Mother serves it with sweet chili sauce, which is a really nice fusion taste. 

Service is fast and friendly but could get hectic when the opera rush comes in (since the COC is just down the street). 

P.S. The Pad Thai is $2 cheaper on the lunch menu, but the dinner version is almost twice as big as the lunch version. No dinner menu until 5:30PM!"}
{"text":"Best pad Thai I'm the city. I love heading into the city and stopping there to get pad Thai. I have had some of the desserts there and they are quite rich but they are not the best the at the queen mother. If you are looking for a real authentic Thai restaurant it isn't that but it is a great place to stop for lunch and the service is pretty good too. The food had great flavor. Both the pad Thai and the Ping Gai are terrific and I recommend both of them to all!"}
{"text":"So long Queen Mum, thanks for the memories!

The Queen Mother Cafe was one of the first Queen Street restaurants I visited when I came to Toronto to attend university in the 80's.  It became a special place to meet with friends and discuss lofty subjects over sticky rice with peanut sauce, Pad Thai and wine.  Cozy, warm, eclectic and cool.  The Charlie Pachter 'Queen on Moose' prints welcoming one to a uniquely Canadian experience. 

Perfect after skating in Nathan Phillips Square or for sitting on the back patio on a hot summer evening, I frequented the Queen Mum about 12-15 times throughout the 80's and 90's.  The food changed very little, and that was always reassuring.  The service was always casually friendly and consistent.  I brought many visitors to Toronto here to share the experience, always to a very positive response. I remember my mom trying Pad Thai for the first time. In fact, that was her first try at anything Asian, (beyond sweet and sour chicken balls) and her mind and taste buds were jolted awake. 

Over the last 15 or so years, as Toronto's food scene exploded, my taste buds drove me to continually try out new experiences and I somehow neglected to return to the Queen Mum.  

We found ourselves in the neighbourhood recently and while deciding where to grab a quick early dinner, my partner ventured 'How about the Queen Mum?' Perfect! 

Well, not so perfect.  We were seated and promptly shown the menu and told that the kitchen was only currently making a limited version of the menu. We were shown the appetizers and then 2 of the mains. Fortunately, the two dishes were ones we were interested in, the Pad Thai and the Ping Gai. We overheard another server explaining that the full menu was the dinner menu, which started a bit later.  Why not have a separate lunch menu??? No, let's show you what you're not allowed to have.

After about 10-12 minutes, we were ready to grab our coats and leave without ordering when we were finally approached by our sever. We ordered drinks and our food. After another 12-15 minutes, our drinks arrived. One of the drinks, a $12 gin cocktail, was served in a tiny stemmed glass and tasted as though there was no gin in sight.

The food arrived a few minutes later.  The Pad Thai was tasty at first but very salty. After several bites it tasted mostly of ketchup.  2 small shrimp and no sign of tofu.  The Ping Gai was basically a piece of dry chicken and half a plate of leafy greens with a bland oil and vinegar dressing, mostly oil.  The saving grace was the bowl of very yummy dipping sauce.

Worst of all, part way through dinner, a Swiss Chalet delivery guy showed up with an order for the kitchen staff.  What the???  We had a good laugh about that one with the table next to us, but it really showed how far this place has sunk.

Disappointed, we ate our food, polished off our drinks, skipped dessert and coffee (would have NEVER done that back in the day), paid and left.  We stood on the sidewalk, looked wistfully at the facade and decided that was the end of an era, our last ever visit to the Queen Mum."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. The first time I went to this place, I tried Khao Soy Gai. They were very bland for my liking I've tasted better KSG before. Friend had pad thai, she seemed to like it. I think it looked pretty standard.
Second time I've been here, I ordered the Ping Gai. From then on, I only order Ping Gai if I go to this place. They cook the chicken in a different way than what I ever tasted before. It's kind of like blackened chicken with Asian twist. The salad accompanying the chicken and the rice were soggy. So yea, I just go here for the chicken...
My friend had the arugula chicken salad. Personally, I think they looked over dressed and soggy. She thinks it's ok.

Service: OK, nothing to brag about.
Price: Reasonable for Queen West
Atmosphere: Cute, cozy settings"}
{"text":"I've only had the pad Thai here which is really good. Nice ambience and good service."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed recent visit. Backyard patio was packed but service efficient and friendly. Calamari a little on the greasy side and dim sum not their best dish. Overall though, wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"J'ai essayé le Pad Thai sur recommendation d'un amis! Il y a des saveurs dedans que je n'avais jamais goûté avant dans un Pad Thai. 
Je recommande chaudement!"}
{"text":"Some friends had a birthday gathering for me here recently and it was wonderful!

It was a sleepy Wednesday night in September and we (somehow) wound up with the patio all to ourselves. They kept the drinks and the Love flowing freely all night:)

Our server (lord help me, I can't remember her name but she was awesome!!) comped us a round of shots and brought me a free piece of celebratory birthday cake (with a candle...*sniff) Our bill ended up being about $250 and though I'm sure any manager would freak out at the free round, that gesture and the amazing service guarantees that I will come back here again and again.

The whole evening was soaked in love, so much so it glimmers like a little drunken jewel in my memory and I can say, without question, that this place and the service (+ food and drinks) made the whole night fabulous for all of us!

Hats off to the Queen Mum and the sweetheart who helped make my birthday extra special."}
{"text":"This was a delicious experience. I got the cannelloni, green salad, earl grey tea and banana chocolate cake. My friend got one of their popular chicken dishes with a huge serving of chicken considering the price and quality. Our service was great, although there was constant bickering and tension amongst the staff throughout our meal that made the atmosphere slightly uncomfortable. One of the staff members, who wasn't our server, was pretty rude to us. We think he was the owner, but we're not certain. However, the constant atmosphere provided by the big comfy booths, local art, candles and low lighting made this a good experience. It was a bit of a pain that they didn't have debit, but that seems to be a constant issue in many restaurants these days."}
{"text":"A stand by in my group of friends for bday celebrations.  Yes, the tables are squished together and it does get noisy.  And I have waited for a table almost everytime I have come here. However, they have a great patio and excellent food.  Love, love, love the ping gai chicken and the steak is delicious too.  For lunch I recommend the burger.  The portions are huge."}
{"text":"We went to Queen Mother Cafe on a Tuesday night and surprisingly (at least to me), the place was full. They have a bar and a few sessions of dinning tables. The decor is very Queen West, church benches, old photographs on the wall, and vintage light fixtures.

It was not a horrible meal experience but what I experience was not a good meal at all. I have to say that my friends were not totally disappointed with their food. One of the dishes was extremely sweet but I did not taste it so I rather not comment much on it.

My main was Khao Soy Gai as I felt that I needed to ask for asian food in there. It was a traditional northern Laotian dish of chicken and noodles. The chicken was strangely soft. The noodles were very similar to cup noodles so I did not enjoy that part much.  The broth of ginger, fresh Thai herbs, turmeric, curry and coconut milk was the only thing I could enjoy in my meal but I left half of the noodles on the plate.

We had dessert and I really don't know what I ate as I took a picture of the one I wanted to try and showed to the waitress but it consisted of some buttery cream, cake, walnuts, and meringue. It was a huge piece. We shared between the four of us and we left most of it on the plate. It was too sweet. 

The service was ok and the place itself was nice but I would not come back there based on the food I had. Thank you God I was in good company!"}
{"text":"The food was good here, but the service was slow and not attentive. Expect to wait a while for you order. Way under staffed."}
{"text":"After shopping at Umbra one snowy Saturday afternoon, my friend and I were starved and the weather was terrible so we stumbled across this charming place in search of a warm, cozy ambiance and that is exactly what we got! I loved my scallops dish served with coconut rice and steamed vegetables and my friend enjoyed the Ping Gai dish as well. Portions are generous and I am a fan of daily specials, so it's nice that the menu changes up a bit. I will definitely go back and try some of their healthy options like their Kale and lentil salad. Great service! I'll be back:)"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Queen Mother Cafe. I found the atmosphere to be very warm and cozy. It felt like the kind of place you'd go to have supper and then stay for 3 hours to have tea and catch up. I had a cup of coffee which was very average although I've never heard anyone rave about their coffee. I have however heard very good things about their Pad Thai, so I dove in. I ordered the Pad Thai and opted for the Vegan option (tofu instead of chicken/shrimp and no eggs) and I asked for it to be spicy. I personally love spicy Pad Thai and I was a little disappointed that this one was more sweet then spicy. I will note that I have a very high heat tolerance so that could be a factor. I was pleased with the amount of vegetables included but this was definitely a very different taste from the  Pad Thai I've eaten in various Thai establishments. The portion size was perfect and overall the food was good. The staff was super friendly and overall I had a good experience. I definitely plan on coming back and I'm giving them a 3 on this visit as I think they have other items on their menu that could push them into the next level."}
{"text":"Here for 38 yrs. used to frequent this restaurant in early 90s. Food remains very good. Pad Thai and sticky rice peanut sauce takes me back to younger days"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for vegetarians

You can order the red curry vegetarian and they are very accommodating about that.  

The ambience vibe and food hasn't changed much over the years but still one of my face places"}
{"text":"I recently had the misfortune of eating brunch at this establishment. I must admit that the only reason I did is I had a 10% discount with my season tickets to the opera, and they are close by.

Our first experience was with the host who was meandering around the place looking quite lost. We asked for the patio but then changed our minds as we needed prompt service and didn't want to be forgotten \"out back.\" Turns out you can be forgotten anyway here.  

Our server was neglectful to say the least requiring flag downs each time we needed her assistance. Such as a beverage, how about to order?? 

My daughter asked for bacon instead of peameal on her eggs-benny. Nope not possible although they offer both on the menu. We both had the BLT, I added a soft yolk fried egg. The sandwich comes on half a loaf of bread with three tiny microwaved pieces of bacon on it. Shameful. The egg was so over cooked it was entertaining. Flat as a pancake and rubbery. When I complained our waitress, who I am certain was still enjoying REM, remarked, \"well you said you wanted it soft.\" I said soft yolk, not the egg softer than say a tire.  

As a finale we once again flagged her down and asked for salt and pepper. She went back to the bar to get them and struck up a conversation with a fellow server. With total memory loss as to why she had made the trip up there in the first place. My daughter went up to get the salt and pepper and the waitress asked her where she was sitting, not even remembering that she had just been asked to bring them to us. By the way we were 10 feet away, hard to miss.

Both the service and the food fell short. I would skip this place and enjoy one of the hundreds of other venues in Toronto that offer fabulous brunches."}
{"text":"During a couple nights stop over in Toronto last month  I was introduced to the Queen Mother by my son who declared, I would dislike the name more than he did but, we had to eat there. 

Ordered a beef strip loin and roasted roots. Was not the size/ fusion/ flavour I expected and was way too much food, but the steak and vegetables were flavourful and done to perfection.

The atmosphere and service were regally appropriate to the locality and clientele. All in all the Queen Mother is an enjoyable trip, rerun."}
{"text":"Very good food while the service was a bit slow. The DIM SUM QUARTET was good.   I had the Ping Gai as a main and it was amazing and there was so much food!  Wow I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Do I wish it wasn't so crazy busy in there sometimes? Yes.

Do I wish the service was a little better sometimes? Yes.

Do I love this place regardless of the above? YES!!!

My fav pics: Calamari, Sangria, Ping Gai Chicken, ANY salad...but the new Kale, Jicama and Apple Salad is out of this world!!! GET IT. NOW. ;)"}
{"text":"Always a good bet on Queen West!

Service can be a bit spotty during super busy times, but For the most part, it's very good. The wait staff tend to be long time professionals of the trade. We don't go that frequently (once every couple of months) but they often remember us and our menu selections!

The food is always good. The Ping Gai is fantastic! I wish they would make the Pad Thai a bit spicier. Even when I've asked for \"hot\", it doesn't have any bite. Ask for the chili sauce on the side..  I wish they would bring back the Seafood Hot Pot!

Ambience can be more than a tad loud and frantic during peak busy times.

Even at it's busiest, I have always enjoyed my meal here."}
{"text":"Gotta order the Ping Gai sensational flavours with a nice presentation. Wicked cool area and pretty reasonably priced. It's a perfect place for a date or to have a meal with an old friend"}
{"text":"Three of my friends and I went there after work last night.  We only had to wait a few minutes for a table...and we lucked out with a booth.  (I always consider myself lucky when this happens!).  We were all really hungry and as we read the menu, our mouths were watering...We made sure we all ordered something different so we could try eachother's dishes.  All 4 of us were super happy with our choices!  That almost never happens.  Gnocchi, Duck, Smoked Paprika Chicken and Ping Gai were all ordered ....mine was the latter.  I LOVED it!  The portions were all very generous and no one had \"order envy\", so that worked out well.  I'll speak mostly about the Ping Gai...the rice, the salad, it's dressing...the dipping sauce...they were all amazing.  A part of me thought about saving some for lunch today...but I just couldn't do it.  I had to finish it all.  I l loved every bite and now...reading some of the other reviews, I see that it's a favorite among other diners.  And I can definitely see why.

I will definitely be back for you, Ping Gai.  

**Side note**  At first, I was joking and saying \"I\"m going to order the pink eye\"...now I take it back...that was immature and an (unintended) insult to such a delicious dish!  

Do yourself a favor...order it.    :)"}
{"text":"Although the place was busy and noisy, the service was ok but the food was excellent. The price was exceptional good for the location of Entertainment District. We are party for 4 and we did order Dim Sum and Calamari to start with and follow with Seafood Hot Pot, Seafood Fried Noddles and two Ping Gai which is total of GREAT! Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"I loved the food, but the didn't have many choice. Half of their menu was alcohol! The bathroom were in the basement and kinda spooked me out. I took a while for the food but like I said was delicious and was worth the wait"}
{"text":"Looking for a succulent and perfectly grilled chicken to satisfy your hunger?  Well, look no further!  

Ping Gai (Ping = grilled, Gai = chicken in Thai) at the Queen Mother Café was one of the tastiest grilled chicken meals I have had in a long time...in fact that last time was also with the Queen of Toronto and her Wingman but at a roadside stand in Chiang Mai. Coincidence?  It was smoky, crispy and bursting with flavor.  Perfectly marinated with black peppercorns, garlic, and corianders.  So good!

Another one of my favorites was the Pulled Chicken Crepes.  Two rolled crepes stuffed with spicy chicken were simply fantastic.  Awesome contrast between sweet and savory.  The side salad kept this dish light and fresh!

And if ... you are looking for something sweet, the Stuffed French Toast here is fabulous!  The French toast was crispy on the outside and melt in your mouth good on the inside without being soggy.

Service was superb!

Good food, homey patio and excellent service.  This is a great place for brunch in my book."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great atmosphere. I've eaten at this restaurant 4 times before and it's always been tasty and the options plentiful. On this visit I had the grilled jerk chicken breast with lentils and other yumminess. There was a person with a severe allergy at my table and the waitress was very accommodating. Also the service was quick!  Definitely eat here"}
{"text":"Another great meal at the Queen Mother Cafe. I've been dining here for many years. Tonight we were back for dinner. I had the kale salad (with lentils, tomatoes and pistachios) that was absolutely delicious. My husband had khao which he really enjoyed.The service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Found the QM Cafe by accident recently.  The family and I stopped in for a late lunch around 3pm on a Monday.  They were happy to see us, and offered seating out back on their patio.  It started pouring rain at one point and the staff were worried, but we stayed dry under the awning.

The menu here is unusual, and varied.  That's good as we have vegetarians and non-v's to please in our group.  Daughter had the burger and fries - very good.  My wife and I had the curried red bell pepper and chick pea soup, and if you want a light, spicy vegan soup this is a good one.  We had the kale and the quinoa salads, also both very good.  The quinoa salad could have used something to give it a little more flavor though.

Didn't have time for dessert, but their case was full of fantastic looking items.

All in all, very pleased w our lunch!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner, I Really loved the atmosphere and decore, very cozy. The food was very delicious (\"Ping Gai\" was the best), and the staff were charming."}
{"text":"The Queen Mother Cafe used to be a vital place that was part of the Queen Street of yore,  but this spot lost its charm. 
Something has changed. It isn't as friendly over all with one exception. The pretty red-haired girl greeting us was very sweet and eager to please but the snarky waiter was difficult to find for anything except the bill. I asked for more ping gai sauce and it took asking him too many times and it arrived when we were done. He seemed like there was someplace he would rather be.

The food was ok but the atmosphere there is not nice. I cannot put my finger on it. My friend's salad was underdressed and too expensive for what we had.  Overall, not acceptable or worth the effort. It was a great cafe in my memory and I guess, that's where it stays."}
{"text":"After a friend's recommendation, I brought my boyfriend and his mom to this restaurant last night. We ordered a couple drinks, I had pink sangria and it was pretty good. After waiting for an hour for our food to come, my boyfriend's mom caught our waitress as she was walking by our table. She asked (politely in a non accusatory tone) when the food would arrive. Our waitress brushed the question off and said \"not long\". As she continued to walk by, my boyfriend's mom said (loud enough so she would hear) \"well, I wanted to know how long it would be.\" A couple minutes later the waitress came back and in the rudest tone possible \"I JUST talked to the CHEF and HE said it would only be two minutes\" The tone was rude enough for my jaw to drop. I couldn't believe she talked to us like that. The rest of our time there was really uncomfortable because of the way she treated us. She was down right condescending and mean! Eventually she stopped coming to our table completely and had another waitress take care of us while she served every table around us instead. I honestly cant even tell you how the food was because I was too upset to enjoy the meal. I have never been treated like this as a customer in my life and you couldn't pay me to go back to Queen Mother Café."}
{"text":"This place has the best calamari out of 10+ restaurants that I've been. Very polite services and nice people to talk to!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Khao Soy Ghai ($13.95), but really shouldn't have. I think they used chicken thighs and the meat looked slightly undercooked. The noodles were kind of sticky, and overall not appetizing, but I was just so hungry that I ate it anyway.

The mimosa ($9) was miserably small. Get a beer instead.

We were seated in the back garden patio which was lovely, but the reflective table tops were kind of annoying because they reflected the sun right into my eyes.

I came here for indoor service a few years back and I don't want to think about how that carpet has probably seen better years. They really need to rip it up and replace it with something more hygienic."}
{"text":"I would never have noticed or thought to venture into Queen Mother Cafe if my co-worker never recommended it. The signage is worn out and the exterior is in general very shabby.

Similar to the frayed exterior, the interior is small/cozy with faded wood as the predominant feature. Our server gave us directions to this 'hidden' patio - we had to go down to the basement first, past the washrooms and up the stairs again to this secluded patio! It was too nice of a day outside to resist eating outside - the chairs are uncomfortable (needs cushioning) and the space is cramped (no where to put my purse), but the sun feels extra nice in October! 

I ordered their lunch special - Butternut Squash Ravioli - my all-time favourite combo! The serving size is a bit small for over $13 before tax, and personally, I didn't taste too much of the squash in the ravioli. The ravioli skin was under-cooked and simmering in a bowl of oil. 

They're quick with serving food during lunch hour, but next time I'll go with something that's not Italian... or maybe dessert - their cake display is extremely tempting."}
{"text":"Some really solid menu selections, comfortable boothy seating. It's hard to say if QM is evolving or sort of stuck in time without any effort to change with the times - be the latter good or bad - but would like to re-visit the Queen again soon anyway. Ping Gai was better than the Phad Thai which was flat and greasy. Places like this can at least get you through the day if you don't exactly dream about them."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday on another friend's recommended.

She told me, \"I don't like chicken. But the Ping Gai is the best chicken I've ever had.\"

I was a little skeptical, but I took her recommended when we arrived and ordered the Ping Gai since the rest of the menu did not really appeal to me much (Asian fusion).

The Ping Gai was soo crispy crispy on the outside and very tender on the inside. At first, I wasn't too pleased because sometimes, I tend to forget how difficult it can be to perfect chicken. After about a week about pondering it (and eating other chicken), I decided the chicken was pretty good and I found myself craving it. 

(When I saw the dish, it wasn't what I expected because I rarely eat Thai food but the dish looked and tasted very similar to grilled chicken at Vietnamese restaurants.)

Good selection of dufflet cakes.

Also, the interior of the restaurant is cute! A little dim and rusty atmosphere with a lot of history. Caters to the \"hipster\" crowd.

I haven't tried anything else at this restaurant but I will probably come back for the Ping Gai one day."}
{"text":"I ordered Pad Thai without much expectation. There was nothing on the outside that made me think it served Thai food.
However the food was real. I was pleasantly surprised by how well the chef executed this dish. It came with chunky pieces of chicken, big shrimps, and a generous portion of noodles that was cooked just right. The overall seasoning was slightly strong, but I did not mind it.
The servers were very friendly and prompt. I was almost taken aback when they took away my plate as soon as I finished it, but I was generally happy with the service. I would like to come back whenever I feel like a Thai food."}
{"text":"I hated being there. I saw the owner/manager yelling at the young server girl unnecessarily  and hated the disrespect. The food we ate was okay, but it used to be better when the place had different owners. The place had a fun funky vibe and okay food but now that there is so much hostility, I will find another place to spend $20 on an entry next time I am in Toronto. Too bad, another favourite off my list. Toronto is changing now that charm is being replaced by greed."}
{"text":"I love the Queen Mother Cafe. I've had the steak, the ping gai, the spring rolls, even the pumpkin dip with pita bread. And with each one, the first taste is always followed by two things: 
1. Hmm. This is not at ALL what I expected. 
2. My GOD I want to eat this for the rest of my life.

It is one of the few restaurants where I seriously struggle over what to order, because it's all so delicious. 

The wait staff is friendly, the service is pretty decent, and the food (like I mentioned above) is amazing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a Saturday night.  It looked pretty full, but they immediately seated the two of us.  I ordered some tea (which I think the waitress was disappointed with) and we started off with their dim sum appetizers.  For a main course I got the daily special which was prosciutto wrapped scallops with mashed yams on the side.  The meal was all good, but nothing spectacular.  I think, weirdly enough, my favorite part was the mashed yams.  

I know that some people here raved about the service, but I really found it somewhat lacking.  I realize that they were pretty busy, but everything took a much longer than it really should have.  However, I'd definitely be willing to give it another shot."}
{"text":"I know my frickin' Asian food.  Ping Gai (a.k.a. Gai Yang in Thai) is a pretty close interpretation of its Thai cousin.

Took you a little time to bring it out to your salivating customers but we forgive you.  It's delicious, tender, meaty, and generously served.  Try it without the lemon and sauce first to build up how you want it.  Allocate about 30 minutes for the chicken to come out during weekday lunch.  Not their fault though, chicken has to be charcoal grilled to get the flavour."}
{"text":"Lunch: 

Food: 3/5 (Veggie burger which apparently is one of their stronger dishes)
Service: 4:5 
Ambiance: 3.75/5 (quaint) 
Value: 3.5/5

Repeat: No"}
{"text":"This place confused me a little...the decor, menu and atmosphere didn't really match, but whatevs, I was here for the stellar reviews. I was debating between the Pad Thai and the Ping Gai, and my really easygoing-friendly waitress recommended the Ping Gai (\"This is what people come here just for\") so I ordered that after reading the reviews on various websites.

The portions were really well sized, the salad simple and delicious, and the chicken's marinade + dipping sauce were good together or separate. I went during the week (a Tuesday, perhaps?) at about three. Not too busy. Good stuff.

Definitely worth a try! I definitely would go back, this time for the Pad Thai though."}
{"text":"Green Light! Come and try it. Especially if you are looking for food at late . Regular menu until 11pm and still great selection till midnight! Love it. 

Interesting menu of Thai dishes even if the ambiance is more of an european flavour, with a little bit of an english pub for the wood and the soft lights. A couple of italian dishes in the menu, burger  and steak frites too. 

Chicken Pad Thai: I tried the first night. Not my favourite I ve had. With a lighter sauce I would have appreciated more. 

House Salad : Nice Balsamic Vinagrette ! My salad was fresh. 

Lomd Som Gai: I loved it. Creamy sauce that nicely ties the chicken, the rice and the vegetables in a spicy lovely sauce. 

Ping Gai: Best Deal! a littel salad, steamed rice and looots of chicken cooked as the thai tradition wants, very soft and nicely spiced. The side dipping sauce on the side, veeery nice, a tiny bit spicy but  a new flavour. 

Starters around 8$
Entrees around 20$
Noodles around 15$

Nice selection of cocktails to be drinked at the nice intimate bar.

Nice music, not loud."}
{"text":"The sticky rice and peanut sauce are even better here than in Thailand. 
They serve a diverse world of food- the Italian dish is on the menu just for the non-adventurous out there. The chef is thai, so he makes the real stuff. Although I don't eat it, the Gai Ping (or Ping Gai) aka BBQ Chicken is served in massive quantities, with rice and salad and is reportedly very good. 
The desserts are amazing too, from Dufflet. The bar selection is great and the outdoor patio is a secluded city oasis. All hail the Queen."}
{"text":"Came by Friday with a colleague for lunch. I got the khao soi gai and she got the ping gai. The ping gai was delicious especially with the house special sauce but the khao soi gai was so... underwhelming. My noodles were super soggy and my dish wasn't hot or remotely spicy.
They serve desserts from Dufflet - we ordered a white chocolate (berry?) cake and the cappuccino one. The white chocolate cake was so stale we couldn't even finish it."}
{"text":"Way back in my youth, my friends and I used to trek from the suburbs, downtown to eat here and then go for drop-in life drawing at the TSA. Hence the evening became 'Food & Nudes'.

Fast forward to like a million years later and I still love this place. ESPECIALLY the sticky rice with peanut sauce -- though I kind of miss the nudes."}
{"text":"The pad thai was amazing and so was the calamari.
They do gin and tonics just like the british.

I knocked the star off only because of the layout of the place. 
The tables are just that tiny bit too close to each other, i dont wanna hear my neighbours conversation.
The big windows at the front are nice, just a shame about the view.
But those things cant be helped.
Its a great eat.... Little bit expensive.... But worth it."}
{"text":"Wandered in here randomly on a Thursday night with a friend. We had no idea this would be more of an Asian fusion restaurant, but was pleasantly surprised. We did have to wait about 15-20 min for a table though, this place seems really popular. We weren't really hungry so we only had a few drinks and apps. We had the Nam Jeun( spring rolls) and calamari. Both were tasty! Makes me want to come back and try their entrées. Their menu seems pretty extensive with a mix of different foods to suit different tastes. I do agree with some other reviewers that it might be a bit confusing though. Overall, service was friendly and I would definitely want to come back and try more of their food!"}
{"text":"This place was slightly confusing. Looking at the menu it felt like it was trying to accomplish too much. A Laotian dish followed by a burger, followed by fries, followed by Pad Thai. Just strange!

We ordered the Khai Soy Ghai and I really enjoyed it, but if I returned would probably prefer the Bah Mi Hang which a friend ordered and I thought was great.

Still... not sure I'd return though."}
{"text":"I've always had some sentimental attachments to this place since it was a first date discovery, but at since coming back I have to admit it isn't really as special as I'd hoped (which I can't say without noting the irony).

I've sampled/stolen for dinner(s): quinoa salad, calamari, chicken tacos, canneloni, pad thai, and ping gai. Ping gai was very good, as reviews claim, but as an Asian foodie I was not impressed, knowing that similar fare can be had in Chinatown for half the price. Other dishes were good with decently generous portion sizes (especially the pad thai), but all had to work to justify the slightly inflated prices considering quality (about $15-20, with a few things closer to $10). 
It should be noted that food is significantly ($3-5) cheaper during lunch, though they do change/cut down their menu

The ambiance is actually quite nice - especially late at night. The place becomes intimate and lovely (dark, candlelit, etc). Service is also fairly friendly. 
Why a 3, then? They have a 18% service charge for groups of 5 or more(!), and don't take reservations. I guess the conclusion is don't come here in groups.

Food versus price: 3.5/5
Service/ambiance: 3/5

Overall, this is a place that I could come back to if (less than a group of 4) people suggested it, but it's not high on my priorities list."}
{"text":"Pad Thai ($14.95 as of 3/15/2017) was one the best Pad Thai I every had.  I like Thai food so I went to many Thai restaurants in USA but it was so good."}
{"text":"Queen Mother is a whole better than the sum of its parts.
The Laotian/ Asian fusion food is great. It isn't the mind blowing thai coming out of Pai or Sukho Thai, it's  (from what I understand but could be wrong) Laos focused and a bit sweeter. The Pad Thai is tamarind forward and so delicious. The apps are all solid, and all the noodles dishes are super \"yummy\" and go down like comfort food. 
Over your favourite pad thai, QM is the place to come for a big yummy comfy plate of noodles.
The vibe is a (clean) dive bar in the heart of Queen West. It's unassuming and has a chill, hip vibe perfect for a casual dinner or a late grub after an event nearby.
Service always great. Crowd always friendly.
Also, clearly noted variety of gf and vegan options."}
{"text":"Small portions, overpriced. Good flavour in the ping gai curry but it was mostly filled with noodles and nothing else, which is in no way enjoyable. Pad Thai had some good things happening, the sauce was flavourful but not very legit Thai."}
{"text":"I went about a year ago on Friday just before the crowds. The ping gai was so moist and delicious. The pad thai was okay, but I'm starting to think I'm not a big fan of pad thai. I loved the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The pad thai here is some of the best pad thai I've ever had. While the portion looked small when it was fist served, it was actually very filling. My only complaints are that the service was a bit slow (although to be fair I was there on a weekday at lunchtime), it's on the pricey side compared to a lot of other Thai food restaurants (edamame is almost $7!!) and they are very skimpy on the shrimp in the pad pad Thai (I only got 3 small pieces). Other than that, the food was good and I will probably go back every once in a while for lunch. I just wish they would put a bit more shrimp in the pad thai!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a late night bite to eat, coffee and cake on the recommendation of a friend. Apparently this place is 'Asian-fusion' although you'd never know it from the outside or the decor. Haha, it just looks like a standard diner, contemporary cuisine, maybe cafe-style place. 
We got a Spinach Dip to start and it was a little off-putting. It just wasn't all that appetizing: the dip was ice cream scooped in a ball on top of some lettuce like some giant puke green lunch room slop. It didn't taste bad, but it didn't taste particularly good either at all either and some of the chips were soggy with water (I assume from washing the lettuce the dip was placed unnecessarily on). We'd ordered this dish as a \"What would you suggest?\"-recommendation of the waitress, so it was a little disappointing. 
For dessert we ordered some cappuccino and we tried the lemon crunch cake. The cake slice was huge, but a little dry and a little boring unfortunately. Maybe it wasn't incredibly fresh? It seemed to be mostly air, crunchy cookies, and very little actual cake and icing. Not incredibly lemony either, more creamy than anything. Again not bad, but underwhelming. The cappuccino was fine. 
I might be back in the future, but it would be up to a friend to choose this place because I wouldn't be likely to with so many other options to try or go back to nearby. Probably 2.5 stars. I'm a little iffy on this place."}
{"text":"Best pad Thai in Canada. Sat on the patio, away from the traffic, and was not disappointed with yet another great supper.

Highly recommended the Queen Mum for a great basic supper."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I really enjoyed it. The service was super nice, originally we had gotten a small table in a shadowy corner but when the couple in the window seat left and we asked if we could move they were more than accommodating. They also were kind and quick taking our orders and bringing food and water. The atmosphere and building itself is a little bit old but can come across in a cute, typical queen street, kind of way. To eat I got the arugula pecan salad with chicken and holy it was so, so delicious. I'm not generally a salad eater but needed a light lunch and this was perfect. I would come again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Lively atmosphere. Great service. Absolutely loved the Ping Gai - Laotian Grilled Chicken. I would make the effort to eat this dish at this restaurant every time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Cute place! Only 2 beers on tap, but a good bottle selection. Good pricing. Staff was friendly. Pretty dim lighting though; not good for taking photos. 

Sat at the bar, but the booths looked cozy. Wouldn't mind trying the food."}
{"text":"This is a classic spot in the west part of dT. Very intimate setting good for dates, outings w close friends, etc. they have a variety of options for example  coffee, drinks, food. It's  better for drinks and speciality coffee than dinner. Definitely worth a try when in this area."}
{"text":"Terrible service, with a waitress who barely made eye contact and, insult to injury, handed me the wrong bill.

Would have been forgiven were the food good, but it's not.  My pasta dish of uninspired, overcooked vegetables and pasta and cheese arrived barely warm. At these prices - about $16 per entree - I expect more.

I can't believe this place is often crowded.  To me this is like the Mcdonald's of the hipster scene."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto from Northern Virginia, and yelp seemed to have a lot of positive reviews so I thought I would check it out.  I brought a friend who was non-vegetarian, and I was not eating meat during this meal.  

We had the following. 

Appetizer: CURRIED QUINOA SALAD
Her Entree: KHAO SOY GAI
My Entree: SPINACH AND RICOTTA CANNELONI 

The Quinoa Salad appetizer was pretty decent.  I've never had quinoa before, but I've heard of it as a healthy alternative to rice.  

My friend wanted to try the Pad Thai, but I talked her into the Khao Soy Gai.  I later had leftovers of this a few days later, and I agreed with her assessment.  It wasn't very good.  It was basically some chicken with some noodles.  I was expecting something a lot more flavorful.  It was not really up to that. 

I had the Spinach and Ricotta Canneloni, which I thought was pretty tasty.  I also had leftovers a few days later, and it was basically still very good.  For a vegetarian option, this seemed pretty good.  I often have a tough time finding a vegetarian option that is healthy and tasty.  This menu had limited options for this type of diet.  

The location was relatively easy to find on the north of Queen Street opposite a few indian restaurants.  It has a relatively busy environment.  Many fo the folks there were engaged in heavy conversation, and most seemed to be having a good time.  I would recommend this if you are looking for a chatty environment that many people would enjoy.  Also, the desserts looked good althought we didn't get a chance to try them out.  

I put $$ for the cost, which is in the $11-30/person range, but we didn't have any alcohol or other drinks, just water, so please take that into account. 

As far as the service, the waiter seemed relatively nice, but I wouldn't say anything memorable. It seems they are fairly busy, so you can get lost in the shuffle."}
{"text":"The Queen Mother Cafe violates a sacred restaurant rule:  You should get what you pay for.  This means that so-so food can be enjoyable in a laid back, cheap cafe setting and it's also reasonable to pay a lot for outstanding food and service.  But Queen Mother is far too expensive for what you get - both in terms of service and food.

Arrived there tonight around 7:30pm after a wonderful day and drinks with friends - so we were in high spirits.  But Queen Mother brought us down. 

Fresh roll appetizer was mediocre - the filling was pretty good with tofu, mint, peppers, lettuce and glass noodles, but the rice paper wrap was clumpy, clumsy and full of holes, so the rolls fell apart.  I'm no Top Chef contestant, but if I had made those rolls, I wouldn't have served them looking like that.  The dipping sauce was tasty, but strangely grainy.

Veggie Pad Thai was really disappointing.  The server told me that I couldn't get tofu instead of the chicken and shrimp they usually serve with the dish.  When I asked why, given they clearly had tofu in the kitchen (since it's part of two other dishes).  She just said, \"vegetables only\".  Of course, they had no problem charging the full $14.  The noodles were overcooked and the sauce was just badly balanced - too salty, too sour, a little too intense.  As though the chef used a pre-made thai paste without diluting it properly.  Weird.

Vegetarian Roti was pretty bland and actually tasted microwaved.

Not a bad place for coffee and dessert, but for dinner I recommend you go elsewhere.  There are so many great places on Queen street where, for $14-$20 mains you can get a lovely meal and terrific experience.  You can do better.

Vegetarian Score: This is a tough one.  There are veggie options, but who cares? They are low on protein and high on \"meh\".  5/10.

p.s. When the server cleared our plates, she said, \"Would you like to wait a bit or would you like your coffee now?\"  Note to server:  manipulation is a sign of weakness, my dear."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended. Even though I've been to Toronto many times before mainly around Caribana time it never really afforded me the opportunity to check out different restaurants.  At any rate my family and I ate here and shared three different entrees and all plates were cleaned.  The Ping Gai chicken was excellent juicy and fill of flavor as well as the Pad Thai as well as the Bah Me Hang which had a nice kick to it. 

I will def come back here when next I am in town and will try replicating the Ping Gai as the recipe is online."}
{"text":"I'm a visitor to Toronto but once lived here and have always visited the Queen Mother as the food is great and prices are reasonable.   However this time they have fallen short with food quality. 
We had the Dim Sum that was ok, but not great, then we had a dish with shrimp, chicken and egg noodles that was Very salty, a couple Small pieces of chicken and 1 shrimp...yes one (1) small shrimp!!!
I asked the server if this was normal and he said no, it should have 2.....yes two (2) small shrimp. 
He then returned with  small bowl with you guest, 2 small shrimp....wow."}
{"text":"L'ambiance est agréable, décor original, funky. La cuisine est correcte. Reste un inconournable de Toronto"}
{"text":"I've had some solid meals here lately:
Both the spinach and cheese cannelloni and the quinoa salad were fantastic.  Everyone in my party also enjoyed their meals - Pad thai and Ping gai)   Service is always good.  There is a great selection of fresh Dufflet cakes in their fridge, although with their amazing large portions, I'm never hungry for dessert!

Tip: If you're coming on a weekday, arrive at 12 on the dot... because by 1 pm this place is JAMMED!"}
{"text":"With so many places to try I keep going to Queen Mother Cafe. Especially now with the little summer outside patio in the back. Lunch or dinner we consistently order the same thing. I love to try new dishes but the Pad Thai and Ping Gai are our favourites. We now have to share so we each can have both. Medium spice Pad Thai warms it up but not hot. Noodles are sauced but not saucy and the prawns and chicken are tender. The Ping Gai is so good. Tender grilled chicken with dipping sauce are perfect. The sticky rice and salad are good together. I don't know what the salad dressing is but it is simple and good. I see people having different dishes that I may try some day but I would need to go with at least three people with one  ordering Pad Thai and the other Ping Gai and willing to share!"}
{"text":"As always there are places that are known for some things and not for others. Personally, the Queen Mother is not a place I would go to eat anything. It just does not inspire the concept of a gastronomical positive experience. If I wanted good Pad Thai I can think of a half a dozen better places, three within walking distance that I would rather eat at. 

Also, I am not a fan of fusion, unless it is really, really well made. Why? Because I generally prefer authenticity over just filling up my stomach, specially if I am paying for it. So, I can honestly say, when either a friend or myself have chosen this venue, it is not because of what you will find on their food menu.  Oh no. 

Queen Mother is like a cleaner, less book-shelved and less trippy version of the Red Room or the \"someone-call-a-food-inspector-to-shut-this-dingy-place-down-again\" Green Room. As their menu seems to be akin yet slightly more appetizing and pricier than the ones found in the other two locales. Which is not saying expensive. 

In the end you come here to chill. Spend a few hours without being harassed to leave (quite hill of them), have beer(s) or coffee(s), meet and chat with friends and watch the hipsters in their natural habitat. For that my friends, this venue is well recommended. :-)"}
{"text":"I didn't know this is a Thai/Laotian restaurant by the name of the restaurant until I searched it online standing outside the restaurant door.  The service is okay.  I ordered the Khao Soy Gai, a northern Laotian noodle dish.  It was my first time having Laotian dish.  It was flavorful.  The broth has ginger, turmeric, curry, coconut milk, and some fresh Thai herbs.  It is garnished with mint and shallots on top of the noodle.  The menu said it has marinated bok choy, but I couldn't find any in mine.  I think the dish was a bit pricey for the amount of food in it."}
{"text":"soo good...halibut. yumm.
came here before a ballet show cuz I wanted to try something new on the higher ender side.  real nice warm interior- lovely back paio.  delicious food- really nicely done dishes that are just right.  not overthe top in anyway- the flavour is delicate and perfect.  
the servers are so lovely as well.  can't think of anything bad about this place.
i would totally make this a regular place.

oh, and did i tell you i hate HATE fusion places?  but for queen mum.. i'll get over it."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times, including last night.  I like this place, it is a solid choice for food and drinks.  My friend and I headed to the patio.  He had a yummy dish and a beer.  I just had a beer.  The patio is awesome, although getting to it is confusing for new-comers.  I like the vibe, it is very laid back.

I remember eating here years ago, and being happy with my meal.  My only complaint and it isn't really a complaint, was that the service is a bit slow.  Other than that, great space for food, drinks and a catch-up!  They've been around for as long as I can remember, and I think in Toronto that says a lot!"}
{"text":"good vibe for brunch, nice patio in the back, food is just ok tho, nothing special, but service is good, their trout dish was dry and overcooked, their egg noodle dish was too salty and dripping with sauce - i could get better in chinatown quite frankly, if you order the plain dishes though it can be an ok meal - the location is great right in the heart of downtown Toronto"}
{"text":"It's nice. I went to the back patio (which is downstairs, through the restaurant and then back up and then out....) to enjoy the sun. Even in the middle of the week it was packed. The drink options were okay - not a full bar at least not in the patio area, but they had some beers, cider and wine so it was fine. Had some snacky foods. The price was okay, the service was quick. 
It has a very laid back and hip vibe. I imagine it would be a good bar to go to with a group, though even for one-on-one the ambience was good on the patio. 
A solid place, nothing to write home about, but worth checking out if you're nearby."}
{"text":"I did not like this place. I recall the food and service as being mediocre and the prices a bit on the high side given the portions and good quality. I also found a hair in my food, which is always disgusting. I just don't get the hype about this place!"}
{"text":"I went here after I read about it on the weekly Yelp newsletter. 
yeah the back garden patio is very secret as it's hidden from the front streets. but it's also way packed with little tables... we were seated so close to a couple next to us that it felt like we were lunching with them.
we changed the tables though.
the food is good and the portions are great. but somehow I didn't expect thai and indian in queen mother cafe.... should be something more european on the menu no? I loved my pad thai though."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool spot for coffee, dessert, dinner. Their pasta and dessert dishes looked great and saw someone eating sticky rice here. Prices are good too and there is plenty of space."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai I've ever had! Hands down!
The decor, atmosphere is very misleading, as it looks very \"pubby\" and unkept. I wish they would have a better beer selection too.
But their pad thai! Oh man! I'll come back for that any day!"}
{"text":"Had dinner on Friday with four girlfriends, had no issue getting a table, which is always nice. We were greeted quickly and have friendly service for the evening. The food was great.  Three of us opted for Khao soy gai (mine has rice noodles to make it GF) and one had ping gai. Everyone enjoyed their meals and had no complaints. What was great was that we didn't feel pushed out after we were done eating too. If you like authentic flavourful Thai food, check this place out."}
{"text":"Keep in mind that I've only eaten here once, but it wasn't entirely amazing.  The food was fine, but the place was very noisy and cramped.  Maybe we were there at the wrong time!"}
{"text":"I used to go here years ago and it was a favorite during any trip to Toronto back in the day. But I seemed to have forgotten about it while running around after shiny new restos and bars. But I met an associate for lunch here yesterday and I was impressed all over again. The place is as bustling and vibrant as ever. I had the Ping Gai which was really delicious. A nice portion of perfectly marinated, and grilled to crispy black in places, chicken. Side salad and rice were nice as well. Service was great considering the place was pretty busy at lunch. Very happy to have found this old friend again."}
{"text":"Got a booth for lunch on Friday at 12:15. If we'd been later we wouldn't have scored.
Waited one hour for our meals. Ordered dim sum which was four pieces in a pot. Friend ordered spring rolls which were three small tasty rolls, but not enough food for either of us. The two guys ordered pad thai & some other noodle dish which looked delicious  Wouldve ordered more had we known the portions were so small and such a long wait. 
Server was good to ensure our water glasses remained full & was apologetic for the slowness. 
The other three of my friends were served their meals and I was told mine would be right up. They waited, but I told them to start eating because it was 15 minutes before my order came out. I felt like I was going to be the left out one which happens at disorganized restos sometimes - I was worried. 
Don't know if I'd go back."}
{"text":"The Queen Mother strikes me as a better version of my much despised location \"The Red Room\" over on Spadina and College. I attribute that to mainly the dark ambiance and menu. To directly compare the 2 for myself I ordered the vegetarian pad thai and was pretty happy with it, it was a pretty large portion and I was unsure I could finish it off but managed to get around it. 

Our service was friendly, nothing alarmingly great but just good enough. They have a decent sounding menu and a good drinks list, I really enjoy the fact that they also provide free wifi.  Brings them up at least 0.5stars for encouraging people to hang around. 

But until next time (there will definitely be a next time) the Queen Mother remains a 3 or 3.5 star location for me."}
{"text":"When I discovered this place it became my new pre-club, pre-theatre restaurant venue. (the old was was the brasserie which unfortunately closed down and is now a Jack Astors).

I love that the place has character, and this unique feel. Inside, it's warm and friendly, and the menu is full of everything from confort food, to fusion food.  Usually they have a specials menu that's also quite good. I haven't tried some of their 'asian dishes' but everything else has been done right by me. 

It's my first recommendation if someone wants to eat in the area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite dining spots in Toronto.  I've tried most of the menu items--the crab cakes are so-so too much filler not enough crab but the steak frites and calamari are excellent.  Pad Thai is ok but can be too sweet depending on who is making it.  Service is brisk and efficient.  Summer patio area can be unbearably hot at time it would be great if they could install some fans in the patio area."}
{"text":"I went here today for food for the first time and I was disappointed. First, we waited far too long to be served, everyone else around us had service, but it took forever for someone to finally notice that no one had asked us if we wanted even a drink. Then I ordered a veggie wrap, with salad. When it came, I was given half salad, half fries, so I had to have it fixed. Then the salad was drenched in dressing, so much so that I had to blot it with my napkin. And my wrap was dripping with oil, again - blotting with my napkin. When I got the bill I was charged extra for the half and half fries, that I didn't ask for in the first place. Doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here and the food was incredibly tasty. However, the noodle entree dish I ordered was all noodles. Two tiny shrimp and two thin small pieces of chicken. I feel ripped off! Told bartender and all she said was \"sorry\". Didn't offer to get manager or make amends. Not a well run restaurant."}
{"text":"A great place for late supper when I am at the Hilton. Love the ping gai chicken and the quinoa salad. If alone it is nice to sit at the bar and have a draft while enjoying dinner. Open late but menu gets smaller. If I end up there late I end up with a soup. A very good soup mind you but the name escapes me. It is the only item containing meat on the late night menu.
Have a little patio in the back that is nice for summer dining."}
{"text":"My partner and I always default to the Queen Mother when we don't know what we feel like eating...the food is generally delicious, the atmosphere a bit romantic and great for people-watching, service is genuinely kind, and the location is a perfect place to start your night. 

I usually start with the Nam Dip and get the to-die-for Ping Gai. Really healthy portions ensure you leave feeling full."}
{"text":"An absolutely wonderful find! Cozy atmosphere with tons of character and very quality food. Plenty of vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options. You get the sense you could stay there for many hours!"}
{"text":"I had the Bah Me Hang which was really good. I like the food overall, it's not quite authentic, but I wasn't expecting it to be. Drink menu has a lot of variety as well. 

Service was good, we had a nice waiter who was patient and friendly and gave us good recommendations. 

Atmosphere is cosy, might not be the best if you are a party of 10 or more. 

We noticed the dog paintings on the walls which we thought were cute. 

This place is quite pricey for both drinks and food, especially food. Prices go well with the portion sizes, but for overall creativity and quality, I don't think my plate was worth the $13.50. I probably would price it at about $8 at most."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. I ate here a few times during my first Toronto vacation and just had to come back. Honestly, the calamari here is the best I've ever eaten. The squid is tender and the outside is perfectly crispy. The Laotian spring rolls were delicious as well. 

We sat out on the patio which was quaint and relaxing. Overall, really good dining experience."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch to this classic spot in the city, and of course service and food were amazing as always! I had the Smoked Eggs Benedict with a cappuccino and I am for sure going back and having the same order... it tasted amazing.
For a Sunday morning it was not as busy as expected, so would recommend going here if you are not willing to wait on long line for a Sunday brunch at downtown Toronto.

The eggs Benedict come with potatoes and a slice of strawberry and orange, in my opinion they could serve more fruit."}
{"text":"Very very good Pad Thai.  Sat on the patio out back.  Very worth the wait."}
{"text":"Most importantly, the lighting is excellent. Dim but not too dark. Food is eclectic Asian fusion done very nicely. The artichoke dip comes with some sort of root veggie chips - very crunchy. Spring rolls are fresh, peanut sauce is delicious. The service is average but you are there for the food and the atmosphere.

Beer selection could be larger but the wine list is decent. Also, tables are small - no room for winter coats. I was torn between 3 stars and 4 but since you can't give 3.5 I will err on the side of optimism.

Oh and faux pictures of the Queen drinking beer are pretty fun to look at."}
{"text":"This restaurant thoroughly confused me. I've passed by this place many times throughout the years and I never would've guessed that it is an asian fusion restaurant just by looking at it. The interior is dimly lit, cozy and eccentrically decorated. While it is a comfortable place to grab a bite to eat, there are better places to get asian or asian inspired food around Queen St W. 

I had the Nam Dip ($8.95) and their pad thai ($14.95). The Nam Dip is 3 rice paper rolls filled with tofu, carrots and greens served with a peanut sauce. While I enjoyed it, the portion for the price was lacking. They also skimped on the tofu (which isn't even that expensive). The pad thai was a decent portion. While I enjoyed the cook on the noodles and the amount of protein (chicken and shrimp), the sauce had issues. There was too much sauce, and the sauce didn't taste like pad thai. I understand that this is an asian \"fusion\" restaurant, but I'd hope for some authenticity in a traditional thai dish. 

A quick peruse through the menu shows a slew of pretty common asian dishes (pho, khao soi etc) that you could easily get elsewhere at a similar price and with a more authentic experience. I do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"If you want to sit comfortably in a quaint café, and enjoy a piece of good quality cake in the Queen Street West area, this place is for you.  You have to choose your cake at the display; it's not posted on their website or menu.  I highly recommend the one called \"Turtle...\" at about $7-8/piece."}
{"text":"Queen West area of Toronto.  We walked here after visiting Ripley's Aquarium- 15 minute walk north.  Very interesting restaurant with Thai, Laotian, Sri Lankan, Italian and burger options plus rich desserts - all under one roof.  

Most everyone in the restaurant were having the south Asian food.

I had the Laotian Khao Soy Gai - Chicken simmered in a spicy broth served with egg noodles, being sprouts garnished  with mint , shallots and bok choy.  The coconut based curry went well with the egg.noodles.

Two in my party had the Bah Me Hang one prepared with shrimp and the other with Tofu.  I had a taste of both - both were excellent.

The desserts looked too appetizing to pass up.  We shared the Pink Velvet cake.  The cake was delicious with. Chocolate cake base.  A great ending to a mostly South Asian themed lunch.

Interesting lunch in Toronto's hip Queen West district."}
{"text":"The food was fine, aside from a weird pickle taste in the Khao Soy Gai.  The problem arose in finding gluten free options.  Before we went, I called them and asked them specifically to name the items on the menu that were gluten free.  They named most of the salads and recommended the Ping Gai chicken.  I went planning to order that, but I wanted to make sure that it was gluten free, so I asked again.  The waiter came back and reported that it was not, as advertised, gluten free.  They completely mislead me about their gluten free offerings.  The staff needs training on knowledge of allergies and their menu."}
{"text":"I have been to Queen Mother Cafe three times. Overall, service has been adequate. There were times when the service could have been better - at times, it took a while to get seated (even though the cafe itself was not very busy). It also took a while for the servers to get my bill. Apps and entrées were good - nothing out of the ordinary, but good nonetheless. The food was a bit overpriced - I mean $11 for salad? I would pay maybe $6 max. for the quinoa salad that I got today. Desserts, however, were delicious! I remembered trying their triple chocolate cake and it was really good! 

After my experience with QMC, I would probably come back just for desserts (and perhaps try out their espresso and coffee)."}
{"text":"Quirky, to say the least. Offbeat. Decorated with irreverent posters and pictures of QE II and her mother. Food is Asian oriented. Lots of noodle dishes. Service is actually efficient and cordial, even during a crowded lunch hour. It must be a favorite because it's been there 40 years and this visit it seemed to be the busiest eatery on Queen Street--which is crammed with places to dine. I love their Cosmic Burger (vegetarian) on whole wheat pita. They have a full bar and make great cocktails. The place is also known for its deserts. If you can get a window seat, it's great for people watching. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Just want to say that the outdoor garden seating was very nice. We especially enjoyed the calamari. We thought the sauce that came with our Laotian egg rolls was the better sauce for the calamari than the one they came with. Personal taste perhaps. Laotian egg rolls were great as well. Quinoa salad was very tasty. We really enjoyed the place."}
{"text":"Unnff this place was SO good, it's not even funny.  It's cute, quiet, not too expensive, and the staff is super friendly.  I ordered the Ping Gai and it was amazing (description from their website: boneless chicken marinated with garlic, coriander and black peppercorns, grilled crispy and served with a spicy lime and coriander dipping sauce, green salad and steamed rice). Maybe it doesn't sound too exciting, but it was sincerely one of the best chicken dishes I've ever eaten.  Although I was too full to try dessert, the options were extremely tempting.  They had several huge cakes in a counter display that were just calling my name..

If you're in Toronto and looking for a place to grab a bite, stop by!  There's no reason to skip over this place, especially since it's surrounding by interesting places to shop."}
{"text":"I was so happy when i stumbled across this restaurant. It's always packed for obvious reasons. The Ping Gai Chicken and Pad Thai are a must try!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times now so I feel confident saying I quite like it! They are good at accommodating lunch groups without a reservation, which is great as we often don't preplan our food outings. Twice I have gotten the kale salad and it is so good that I actually crave it, how many kale salads can you say that about?! The last time I got the quinoa salad and unfortunately the feta in it tasted very strongly of goat cheese and it ruined the dish for me. Not sure if this was an error or if they are using goat feta but if it is the latter they need to update their menu, some people hate goat cheese ;-) My coworkers always seem to enjoy their meals as well and this place has been around a long time so they must be doing something right! My only issue is the price for a salad, this is not a highend restaurant, if anything it is causal, the prices need to mimic that."}
{"text":"I always have a good time here. The food is inventive and there are generally interesting people at the bar from all walks of life, spinning yarns and sharing world travel and foodie experiences. 

I make it a point to visit the Queen Mum whenever I'm in Toronto, it just feels like home."}
{"text":"An often busy lunch and dinner spot, the Queen Mother Café definitely deserves its reputation for serving great food at all times of the day.  They offer both American cuisine (things like burgers, sandwiches, etc) as well as some more popular Asian dishes (Phad Thai, etc)

Honestly, this is probably one of the best Phad Thai's I've ever had.  A friend said to me that it was his favourite in the city, and I thought to myself as you may now be thinking to yourself, \"it's highly unlikely that a café will have a great Phad Thai,\" but I was dead wrong.  I tried it and don't regret it at all.  I guess the only downside is that I can't look at other Phad Thai the same way anymore."}
{"text":"Can be hit and miss.  Basically - a good place to come in the summer and sit in the back garden area - you kind of feel you are not in Toronto (the back patio garden area is a great place to hang out).  Inside is small. (so in the summer I give the place a 4 - for the back patio ambiance factor)

This place is an institution and I can not count the many many times over the years I have come here.

Good:
Pad Thai
Veggie Burger
Cafe Au Lait

Decent place to meet and connect with a friend for a bit and a chat as it is in a good area where you can do errands and also connect with a friend for those moment you need to multi-task and connect over a Latte and get back to being busy.

If it's summer and you want to go to the back patio... You Have to:  Walk down the stairs and continue onwards towards the back of the restaurant....there is where you access the back patio.  Don't walk into the back in the mainfloor - not unless you want a job in their kitchen :-) ..the back patio is downstairs"}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance, knowledgeable and approachable staff, great food. A high recommend from me."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan.

The atmosphere is bustling and the staff are cool cats and kittens. I really dig the eclectic menu and they mix a great cosmo.

Recommended for casual, yet fun dining. the prices are great and you can get a three-course meal with a bottle of wine for two for under $100!

One of the gems in the downtown-downtown core in my opinion. Try the sticky rice, spring rolls and dumplings from the appetizer menu, then I'd recommend trying whatever the chef's specials are for the main course. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years for the Ping Gai. Only thing I've ever had in the 20+ times I've been. Perfect every time. Wish I could make that dipping sauce at home mmm.

Love the place. A bit noisy and dark, so I only go when I'm in the mood for that."}
{"text":"Went with a group about 10/11 for a farewell dinner on a Saturday night in early November 2010

Atmosphere:
Darkly candle lit restaurant with a vibe that could make you feel romantic or just a little chic. I always appreciate places that have real candles on tables and/or around the facility. It adds more real illumination to faces and food etc. This was probably the best part of the experience in my opinion. This place looks better at night and more atmospheric than it does during the day

Service
Our waitress was very quick and helpful in trying to secure a table(s) during a weekend for our party. But she did become a little over obsessive with our table wit the overly fake helpful attitude. But I'd rather that than rudeness.
Drinks -Half the table had water, half alcoholic beverages. Those who had wines and beers seemed to have a hard time getting their drinks refilled. Something when I was serving I tried to never miss - keeping people drinking runs up their bills/ my group gratituty/ and usually their spirits

Food
The biggest disappointment of the evening. The menu does look nice and has good variety.
I ordered the calamari described as: \"marinated with ginger, garlic and chilies, dusted with seasoned flour and served with a sweet chilli dipping sauce $ 9.50\" I'm still looking for the squid underneath the mountain of 'dusted seasoned flour' batter. I think KFC has less layers of batter on their chicken. It was a bit over salted as if to throw off the tastebuds of those who don't know what good flavor is. The sweet chili sauce is the same one I buy at the dollar store. I'm very pocket aware and watch every dime I spend as a student - I only ate maybe half of my meal being so unsatisfied and let the guys finish the rest.  My out of town friend who was visiting ordered what I believe was the |BAH ME HANG -fresh thin egg noodles stirfried with bean sprouts, onions, celery, chopped peanuts, sautéed shrimp and golden sliced chicken in a spicy lime coriander sauce, topped with green onions $12.95\" This meal that was dreadfully spicy hot. He needed his beer to help it go down, but spent half the time trying to get a fresh beer every so often. But he did enjoy the taste of his food as did I.
The best meal of the night ordered (from my end of the table) was the 
Quinoa Salad - it looked healthy hearty and delicious and was so. 

I have no intention of returning to Queen Mother Cafe and although I would not recommend it to anyone, this does not mean I would suggest against going there. It is a restaurant that if I happen to be hungry, walking on the street and am standing in front of it, I would go in. But this city has so much more for me to try to feel the need to return."}
{"text":"Delicious place in Toronto with an eclectic menu and fresh, savory taste. Can't wait to go back! Several meals on the menu looked appetizing. The ping gai chicken entree was juicy and flavorful, vegetable sandwich filling and grilled perfectly, and the pad Thai noodles were the best I've yet to taste. Small gem!!"}
{"text":"I've been walking by this place for years along Queen St always trying to find time to go.  Towards the last week of the TIFF determination paid off.  The floor to ceiling windows, fusion, bar tavern- southern- partially dim- cozy-avantgarde interior at Queen Mother can make you scratch your head in confusion.  After all its pan-asian fusion restaurant, however the name doesnt really speak for it.
Though we came in btw dinner and lunch time, their menu had a lot of restrictions due to food availability.  Where there's a will there's a way.  
We took the advise of the waiter! and it tramendously paid off!

Starters: their Calamari! Probably one of the best calamari's ive had in a while, 4.5 due to size of the calamari.  Perfect balance of batter, and it wasn't drenched in oil.  Biggest kicker is the freshness!! you can taste it. good job!

Pad Thai: This is among my favs, the portion, taste, and overall presentation is worth your palate! 4/5

Ping Gai: WOW!!!! holy sh#$ the grilled coriander chicken was definitely a nice surprise, and amongst one of my fav all time dishes! There's plenty of chicken to go around in this dish, enough to serve two! It was a nice to see them add the arrugula salad on the side which was a breath of fresh air from the white rice, and lots of chicken which came with.  Among my all time favs! 5/5!!!!

Dessert:
Lemon crunch cake!! another all time favs that I have added to my list!! think of it like a LA ROCCA caramel crunch, but this is pure lemon....i can barely comment on the taste because its goodness gave me memory loss!! is it possible to give it 6/5 lol???"}
{"text":"For what it's worth, this review can be taken only as an indictment the menu items noted below. Looking at the other reviews, I see a lot of plates that look great, but I'm not sure I would risk it again.
The dim sum quartet tasted fine, but had an \"off\" smell, indicating poor quality ingredients, and lack of proper seasoning. Also, the texture was rubbery like food cooked from frozen.
I had the red curry seafood hotpot. The rice was served inside the hotpot, instead of in a separate bowl as one expects from a hot pot - I can't imagine why, other than to reduce portion sizes, and the pot itself was quite small to begin with. The supposed coconut sauce was mostly peanut sauce, and it was very extremely thick and heavy - again, not what I expect from a hot pot. There was hardly any spiciness. The white fish portions were very thin and fatty - mostly just skin and fat with a thin bit of meat on the underside. The calamari and shrimp were extra rubbery. There was nothing fresh about this despite the menu stating \"daily fish, shrimp, and calamari\". The only vegetable was a bit of eggplant. It was all topped off with a sprig of wilted cilantro. I finished less than a third of it before it became unbearable. 
My friend had the Lond Som Gai. It was edible. But again, the menu is not to be trusted. It was missing most of the listed ingredients that would add to the flavor profile, and the supposed coconut bean curd sauce was mostly peanut sauce. 
Perhaps if the menu was adjusted to reflect what's actually being made in the kitchen, we would have chosen differently, or just had lower expectations. 
Service was fast and attentive to the point of being rushed. I was asked if I was done with my dish despite having barely made a dent, and my friend was still eating. To be fair, I had placed the lid back on the pot, but it was a glass lid and they didn't ask if I wanted it to-go. I guess they knew how bad it was."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place a million times but I just never noticed it. When several of my friends spoke highly of it I knew I had to give it a try. I went last Saturday and I agree, this is a great restaurant. It makes a great place to not just have your meal but to sit around after and hang out with friends.."}
{"text":"After watching the Nutcracker at the Four Season's, my friends and I were hungry and wanted a quick bite.  We wandered over here and luckily since it was past 9pm there was space for us.  It's pretty small, but if you just want a drink there is great bar seating.

The decor is quirky and the lighting is pretty dim so if you want to hide your pimple to your date - come here!

We ordered the Mac and cheese, the chicken skewers and the Bah me hang - noodles, shrimp, chicken in a spicy lime coriander sauce with peanuts and bean sprouts.  Everything was tasty but I wish there was more shrimp in the Bah me hang dish.  I think only 3-4 pieces.  The portion was big enough for me to have leftovers :)

I've been here before for drinks but this is my first time for food.  Definitely be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"OG Asian fusion comfort food with other stuff.  We have been coming for years and is our go-to in the neighbourhod.  Try the Ping Gai."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and always get a good meal.  Asian and Asian inspired menu full of delicious things.  My faves are the ping gai and khan soy gai.  They also do brunch but generally a great place to stop at when on Queen West"}
{"text":"We live super close to this place and after crossing by a couple of times, decided to give it a try. First impressions: This place looks like a European coffee house from the 20th century and yet somehow serves Asian fusion. Well, that said my husband and I are very open to experiences. We ordered Srilankan curry vegetable roti and Indonesian Grilled Chicken. The chicken was a 3.5/5 but the roti was a total disaster. It was gooey and super bland. They had a good selection of desserts. However, we were full given the decent size of the portions served. It sports a good ambience but I've had better Asian fusion in Toronto at half the price.

Tip: They have a cute little patio at the back of the restaurant that they save for sunny days."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday for lunch during the winter. The restaurant was not particularly busy and we were seated near the front so I did not have a chance to see the rest of the restaurant or the patio which other yelpers have mentioned.

I had the kale, roasted tomato, and green lentil salad ($9.95) and asked for it without pistachios. The roasted tomatoes were unique and quite tasty, but I only received 4 slices of tomatoes, and given that it is in the title of the salad, I was expecting a bit more. The service was standard, although we did have to actively ask for refills on water / tea a few times. 

Overall it's a fine establishment with a wide selection of food, although I may be more inclined to try a different restaurant in the area next time as there are lots of options"}
{"text":"It's a small menu at the Queen Mother but a nice one. Our calamari was particularly flavorful. We had identical suppers--shared calamari, long island ice teas and the chicken. So while we didn't work the menu out, it was good food all around. The service was fine. My only thought was that the restaurant was oddly laid out; there were few sound barriers so it got very noisy."}
{"text":"I had the Pingay, my date had the Cajun Steak Sandwich.. They were both delicious. Queen Mum never disappoints. Prices are good too. :)"}
{"text":"An interesting twist of flavours, with great presentation. Service was great. The seating is set up quite tight, so if you are looking for quiet and intimate, then you would be disappointed. Overall a pretty good experience, I'd go again."}
{"text":"What a weird place.  An English style pub that serves Asian cuisine.  It really is nice inside and the bar tending staff is super friendly.  I ordered a ravioli dish (not Asian cuisine, I know) and really liked it although it was a little bit expensive.  It seems like a cool spot to hang out on Queen Street and definitely one of those places to go hang out with friends for a couple beers."}
{"text":"Came here one afternoon when I had time to kill, so I just sat at the bar. It was very relaxing and comfortable in there... They had some old 70s and 80s R&B like the Brothers Johnson and the Deele playing. The guy and girl working were both super nice with me. I ordered the Pad Thai and it came in less than 10 minutes. It was absolutely delicious -- a little heavy on the sauce but I will take that over the overly dry versions I've had from other places. The pieces of chicken were large and plentiful.

Not usually in that Queen and University area too often, but this is definitely going to be a place I will come back to again either for some drinks or a quick bite to eat. Lots of people came in ordering their cakes, so I guess they have a pretty good thing going on with their pastries and desserts."}
{"text":"I went with a rather large group, that required two tables (we had reservations, not a random drop in, and we knew this), however our tables were split right by the stairs that led to the bathrooms and the patio.
This seemed endlessly annoying to staff, not sure what they expected putting a large group by a place of heavy traffic?
Granted people showed up rather staggered which can be annoying. We were ordering at different times, but the first table had drink and food orders, where needing a minute at the second table meant waiting an hour. Nevermind the server seemed absolutely miserable, only cracking a smile when the check came. 
The food was okay, nothing that special. 
If they had placed us literally anywhere else in the restaurant, and if our server (One for a table of 20 is ridiculous), was above \"all of these people are a huge burden on me\" perking up again, only when we finishing up and we were asking for bills. Not cool. 
I mean I worked in food service for over five years, and somewhere not far from here, during dinner I could only imagine the freakouts any one of my former managers would have had at just the entire experience. And I hate leaving bad reviews, and I try not to give out reviews for places I haven't been to multiple times. However this is one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had, it seems it's better if you go with a small group. 
There's better ways to handle a large group, but for average food and terrible service."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here today and I can't wait to return! Sadly, the patio out back (aka the \"secret patio\" as I like to tell out of town friends I want to impress) was closed, because it is winter, I guess. 

The food was fresh, plentiful and had great flavour! The service was efficient and friendly. I had the Gai Ping (or was it Ping Gai?), which is essentially crispy roasted boneless chicken in some amazing spice mixture with rice, salad and dipping sauce was perfectly executed. Moist, hot, crispy, yum. 

My significant other had the quinoa salad with goats cheese and sun dried tomatoes and it was hearty and healthy. He liked it. 

The only thing I would change is maybe the decor, which is pretty dark and has not changed in years, and those carpets on the floor must be a bitch to clean, but \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" could most certainly apply in this case!

Will be back!!"}
{"text":"I guess my biggest problem with the Queen Mother is that is always busy.  I guess that's a good thing and says a lot about the restaurant.  Found on Queen Street West, this small restaurant has much to offer in terms of its menu and décor.

The restaurant is U-shaped with a bar and counter found at the rear of the room.  The menu is decently focused with a wine list that is completely complimentary.  Specializing in sandwiches and noodle dishes with some other entrees available, this is a great place to have a good size launch or a light dinner depending upon your timing.  The décor is fairly simple yet coolly elegant, and even when busy, still allows for intimate conversation.  The ingredients are fresh and this comes through in the food.  Everything that comes from the kitchen is plated stylishly, and tastes divine.

There's only a couple of beers on tap but the wine list more than makes up for the lack of draft beer that's available.  Besides an intimate dinner should be all about the wine.  Though there's not much room to wait for a table, you'll do well to ensure that you hang about and get one.  It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"In a world of Jack Astor's, Montana's and Gabby's that pop-up seemingly everywhere, the Queen Mother is exactly the type of spot you hope to find when you're wandering on Queen West.

The place has terrific character with closely packed together tables and booths.  Hip and somewhat aloof waiters, and the feeling that you can strike up a conversation with just about anyone.

The menu has a good selection, and the Pad Thai is a great go-to if you're unsure about what to get.  At lunch, the place can get packed, so it is definitely a good idea to sneak out of work a bit earlier to get there.

The service can be slow and the price is on the upper-end of reasonable.

The beauty of the Queen Mother is that it combines good food, reasonable prices, with a great ambiance and the feel of Queen West.  It's definitely a spot that I look forward to going to whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and always enjoy the food and the atmosphere. The service is always friendly and attentive. 

Every time I visit I order the Pad Thai and every time it's really good, very flavourful and tabby, not too spicy and not too sweet. It's well balanced. We also ordered the Sriracha Sweet Potato Hummus, which is made with sweet potatoes, chickpeas and sriracha. A simple combination and well made and delicious, not a drop was left on the plate. The Dim Sum Quartet was a nice addition and surprisingly good, and that's high praise from a guy whose eaten a lot of Dim Sum, Toronto has a lot of Dim Sum restaurants.

Not my first time eating here and definitely not my last time, it's always an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday evening with two of my girlfriends. The shape of the place almost makes it seem like two restaurants. It's quite dim inside, which results in an intimate aura. 

It's labelled as Asian Fusion/Thai but there is a good chunk of the menu that does not fall under either of those categories. I ordered the Pad Thai, while my friends ordered the ravioli (a special) and the nam dip. All the ingredients in my dish complemented each other well, but definitely too much for one person. 

Service was decent (a bit slow during the paying process), but this would be a great place for a group that wants a variety of cuisines."}
{"text":"Interesting place.  It doesn't advertise as Thai, but lots of the food is from Thailand or around (Laos).  The Pad Thai was very average, smallish portion and kind of greasy.  The Khao Souye (sp?) was much better though, very savory peanut sauce and well-done noodles.  The chicken in both was fresh (one can feel the freshness of the meat restaurant-owners! you're not fooling anybody with old/stale/repeatedly frozen/unfrozen meat). The shrimp tasted fresh too.  They have many decadent desert, but my girlfriend saw the server at the desert station taking a bite from one of the cakes before serving them - I guess it is ok (they make them there, after all), but not overly professional."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch here. 

First, the desserts are from Dufflet, so you the ending to your meal will be fantastic.  This visit we had the lemon dacquoise. Fantastic.  They also had a cappuccino one.  Plus chocolate banana cake, apple caramel tart, and other great selections. 

For our meal, we started with the nam dip (salad roll) and nam juen (crispy dried spring roll ).  Both delicious with house made dipping sauces. 

For the main course, tandoori chicken sandwich with a salad and the red curry seafood hot pot.  Fantastic fresh flavours.  

Friendly and attentive service topped off this dining experience."}
{"text":"Took a while for me to try this place cause i always thought the restaurant looks really weird and sketchy. Now i am so glad i got to try this place.

Both interior wise and food wise, this place is trippy. They are kinda western but not really. Have a bit of south east asian but not really. I guess this suits them well since they claim to be asian fusion.

The food here is pretty cheap considering the huge portion you get. I have tried their duck special, Bah Me Hang, which is similar to pad thai but with egg noddles, and Khao Soy Gai, which feels like pad thai in curry. They are all very good and I would definitely recommend then to people who want something more than typical thai dishes.

Service here is okay. Nothing wrong, but you come here for food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I go here usually before catching a ballet, opera or show at the TSO. 

They do not take reservations between 6-8 so plan your visit accordingly. Call ahead and book for 5:55pm. This has always worked for me. 

Food here is delicious - depending on what you order. The Ping Gai is my go to. Succulent, tender, boneless chicken that I served with a salad and a bed of rice. 

My partner had the Pad Thai, which she disliked, and I tried, and I have to admit - it sucked. It was too ketchupy and just not street style enough. Noodles were over cooked and the flavour was lacking - compared to Pai (for instance). 

If you like chicken - do yourself a favour and order the Ping Gai. If you don't like it, I'll cover the bill ;)"}
{"text":"Ping Gai was truly excellent. Just the right size. Very filling. Delicious zesty dipping sauce. Lovely and juicy chicken. Salad greens could have done with a bit less dressing. When the meal left me so satisfied, it's hard to take anything away on the star rating. It'd been ages since I'd been. Will try to get here again really soonish!"}
{"text":"MUST TRY: Khao Soy Gai. (rice noodles in curry soup)

People will tell you that the Ping Gai is the best, but get the Khao Soy Gai instead and thank me later.

Sticky rice is a good snack.... though it can be inconsistent. Last time I ordered this, it came as post-sticky rice. The rice had hardened and was one giant grain of rice, so I had to rip off chunks of it and throw the delicious peanut sauce on top.

This also begs the question: Is there a singular form of the word rice?

There is a back patio. BTW, it has a really strange entrance where you have to walk downstairs, then back upstairs, and your waiter walks through the kitchen. For a moment, it's all a little bizarre and reminiscent of a bugs bunny cartoon.

Servers are good, laid back. 

BONUS: Kitchen is open late"}
{"text":"The menu is limited to salads, appetizers and alcohol late in the evening but the quinoa salad I had was fantastic."}
{"text":"I went with my friend on a Tuesday night after a movie.  It was quite packed inside, but we were quickly seated.  Service was okay - but I can see that they were quite busy, so I can't really complain too much.  

My friend ordered the pad thai, and I ordered the khao soy gai (because I just wanted to try something new).  I absolutely loved the pad thai - probably one of the best pad thais I've had in Toronto - not your ketchup-on-noodles.

The khao soy gai was pretty good as well, but I would have prefered the pad thai.  I'm not a big fan of egg noodles, so I wasn't very content with my dish (but that was m fault because I didn't read the menu very well).

The desserts are delicious - the cakes are from Dufflet!  I ended up getting a lemon parfait cake (which was a tad too sweet for me) and my friend got the toffee apple cheesecake - definite recommend.

Would definitely come back here soon time."}
{"text":"Went there on Friday, waited in line for a bit, ordered Pad Thai and khao soy gai, waited for 20mins. Both of them are not good and over priced."}
{"text":"Get the Ping Gai chicken. Seriously. I'm sure other items on their menu are lovely, but why go for anything else when the Ping Gai tastes so damn good. 

It's sweet and savory, loaded with garlic and cilantro and roasted to perfection. 

Be sure to get a side of their hot sauce for an extra kick."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located just 5 minutes from the City Hall. The entrance was confusing lol, there were like 3 doors and only the left door leads to the actual entrance. We came at around 5:30 so we were able to get a pretty good seat near the window.

 My friend and I both ordered the highly praised Ping Gai. The dish was about $20. The portion is huge and they do give you quite a lot of meat. I didn't quite like the salad however, not a fan of the type of vegetables that they use. I don't remember a lot of details about this meal to be honestly, the food just felt average to me. 

The service was slow, it was difficult to call the waitress over whenever we needed something. One of my pet peeves is when the server not splitting the bill and sure enough here the waitress gave the combined bill. I ended up just giving the curtesy 10%"}
{"text":"It's actually kind of crazy how long I've been meaning to check out Queen Mother Café. It feels like it's been on Queen Street forever and I've been hearing for years that their Pad Thai is something special.

So when the opportunity finally arose to sit down for a meal there, I was more than happy to finally break my streak of simply walking past its ornate doors.

I knew walking in exactly what I wanted to eat: Pad Thai (surprise, surprise). I asked for the dish, which is prepared with \"soft thin rice noodles stirfried with chicken, shrimp, bean sprouts, scallions, egg, chopped peanuts and ground roasted chillies, in a tangy, sweet and sour sauce,\" extra spicy and even requested their \"home made jaew bong sauce\" on the side.

It arrived to the table piping hot shortly after and it's...fine. I mean, it's far from the worst Pad Thai I've ever had, but it's also not even close to being the best.

There's plenty in the dish that really works - the chicken and shrimp is plentiful and the noodles are cooked quite well - but the sauce the whole thing's swimming in is just so lackluster (to put it mildly). The pronounced lack of Thai flavors is certainly a big problem here, but it's the sickly-sweet sauce that transforms this dish into a bit of a chore to finish. (I did eat the whole thing, but the last few bites were not pleasurable at all.)

With Pai and Khao San Road just around the corner, this kind of below-average treatment of a venerable dish just doesn't cut it anymore. (Heck, I'd sooner eat the surprisingly tasty Pad Thai at Thai Express before I'd order the Queen Mother Café's interpretation again.)"}
{"text":"Ping gai chicken is just amazing. I dont know how they do it! The sauce is addictive, the chicken is crispy, the salad and rice accompany it perfectly. A must try!!!! Garlicy limey with a hint of coriander. it is great!"}
{"text":"Been coming for 5 years now. Consistently well prepared food and great service. I love the ping gai.  Partner had calamari and kale salad and was very happy too.  Price reasonable for location."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise. Great service. Marvelous deserts. I ordered ba me hang, with small noodles ( like capellini), chicken and shrimp. Tasty. The dim sum was perfect and calamari tender and cooked well. Definitely worth your attention."}
{"text":"I had the Sri Lankan Curry Vegetable Roti which arrived so hot that it was steaming for several minutes. I soon figured out that it had been microwaved for way too long. After it had cooled down enough to start eating, the roti started to become very tough. Before I could even finish, about 1/3 of the roti was literally rock hard (as a result of over-microwaving). I mentioned this to the waitress and showed her that the remaining portion of roti on my plate could not even be cut with a knife. She didn't even feign caring and just said she would mention it to the cook. 

If I develop a cancerous tumour in the next few years, it will almost certainly be attributed to this meal at Queen Mother Cafe. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"My friend got the ping gai and the chicken was fried with a crispy skin! Delicious! I got the pad Thai medium spice which was way spicer than I expected! My other  friend got medium and it was much less spicy than mine so they might have messed up my order or something! Good food still! Would return but I'm a bigger fan of pai since they have a Thai ice tea that goes so nicely with spicy food!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for lunch at 2ish. Since it was a beautiful day, we sat in the backyard patio. I got the Bah Me Hang, a noodle dish with 'lime-coriander' sauce. I ordered it at medium spiciness, but it was not spicy whatsover, so I ended up adding hot sauce as well. The sauce was overly sweet, in my opinion, maybe to cater towards Western palettes used to sugary thai noodle dishes from fast-food restaurants. Portion size was huge and had lots of chicken and 2 shrimp (for $11). All in all not too bad, but there has to be better Thai food out there in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went there with my girlfriend for a sunday brunch. The good was good, with medium sized portions. Definitely a hipster joint, but would recommend going. They also sell some ridicusely expensive paintings. The food and the service was quite good.."}
{"text":"Hello.  I'm a stupid American that doesn't pay attention to local holidays.  I still don't really know what a \"Civic Holiday\" is, other than it means almost EVERYTHING is closed.  Funny I'm writing this on the American \"Labor Day,\" eh?

We struck out at Pai, Khao San Road, and one other Thai restaurant before finding Queen Mother Café.

Thank you, Queen Mother, for being open for us ignoramuses.

In the mood for Thai (duh), we ordered the Pad Thai.  While the waitress assured me that the \"spicy\" was indeed, spicy, this dish was milder than I had expected.  It tasted good though, and (bonus points) had both chicken and shrimp in the dish!

I had two margaritas, both tart and strong.

The menu is a little all over the place in this moody, casual café.  There's also a full bar menu.  It saved our asses just before we started to get hangry.

Queen Mother Café still probably would not be a \"destination\" for me, as I was obviously headed for some serious hot spots for Thai, but it worked beautifully as a back-up plan.  We left with our bellies full and satisfied."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to this place. Me and a few friends came here after drinking at moxies. Our primary reason for coming was to have the pho we had last time. We were disappointed to find out that it was a special and wasn't on the menu tonight. 

It was pretty busy tonight but we were lucky enough to get seated right away. I knew right away that I was going to have the quinoa salad since I saw someone else get it the last time I was here and it looked good. Also I'm a sucker for goat cheese. Given that I cleaned my plate it's safe to say that it was a good choice. It was a large portion but it felt like the right amount because it was light and fresh. 

Everyone enjoyed their food.  Although I like the food and the portion sizes are quite large I feel like the prices are high relatively speaking.  Obviously not too high to keep me away."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for lunch/dinner before seeing the ballet or opera at the Four Seasons Centre. Cute neighbourhood restaurant with an eclectic menu and friendly service. The food is not terribly memorable, but decent. I have tried some of their salads and pasta. There are usually a few daily specials. They offer dishes such as pad thai, but I am generally against ordering pad thai at non-Thai restaurants... Desserts are just okay -- they have a wide variety of cakes and pies but they are not made in-house. The cakes are catered and are the same ones you might find at TImothy's coffee and other similar places (e.g. oreo cheesecake, chocolate mousse). Prices are decent. The main draw is the convenient location."}
{"text":"filling. portions are huge. and yummy! a mix of thai/viet type food as well as some other \"more white\" additions.

patio. gorgeous an relaxing during the day, romantic at night! wooden lattices with plants growing up them, little (christmas?) lights strung about when the dark falls. to get to it, you must go downstars, through an alleyway, and up the stairs out the back. when the waiter or waitress points you downstairs to the patio, it is not a trick! no need to beware.

having been here a few times, the one gripe I have is that the waiters don't seem to come out to the balcony as much. they're a bit hard to flag down, but maybe think of it as an elusive treasure.

definitely a favourite place on queen street!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has an interesting victorian meets diner decor and the food is categorized as fusion but looking at the menu, it doesn't seem as such.

Had a group lunch here a few weeks back and majority of the group enjoyed the food because of the flexible menu options and the larger portion sizes (compared to other downtown toronto based restaurants).  But if one were to compare to authenticity compared to the main cultural version of the dish, you may be disappointed.  The group enjoyed a variation from khao soy gai noodles to pad thai to pang gai to burger and everything was well grilled/ cooked but when it came to the thai dishes, the spice level was a little low. 

The waitress did a great job managing large group while balancing the weekday lunch crowd.  Quick and attentive service the whole time.  However, closing bill was a little poorly managed.

Overall would come back here again for casual lunch."}
{"text":"Found this place walking down the street.   It was in an old building and has been around 15+ years.  Food was decent.  My wife enjoyed the fish tacos for $19.95.  Not a large portion.  They snuck in a $3 side of guacamole.  My son had a noodle dish (Bah-Me_Hang) for $13.95 that he enjoyed. It had a decent amount of meat. My dim sum appetizer was overpriced at $8.95 (for 4) and the 9.95 Romaine and fruit salad was OK.  I was looking for something lighter.  My daughter ordered a dip with chips for $9.50 (good goddess) that she enjoyed. I am putting the prices down for perspective since many restaurants are very expensive.  They have several cakes for dessert and we chose a banana and chocolate slice for $6 to share.  It was good.  

Net result place has a reasonable sized menu with reasonable prices for downtown Toronto.  Good service and host who spoke about the ghosts when asked."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch and though there were no tables, we quite enjoyed sitting at the bar. The quinoa crab cakes and quinoa salad I had were delicious, and so was the cannelloni my dining companion had. The atmosphere and service are terrific also, and it is easy to see why they are always packed on a weekday for lunch!"}
{"text":"A nice place to go for a late bite. My partner and I went last Monday at around 2300. We were greeted and seated very fast (being the only patrons). 

The waitress was very pleasant and knowledgeable. We started with the Dim Sum appetizer (4/5). Nicely cooked, good taste and decent portions for 2 people to share. 

For main I ordered the Pad Thai (3/5) and my partner had the Ping Gai chicken (5/5).

The Pad Thai was good, a huge portion but was lacking with proteins. Only 4 pieces of chicken and 3 shrimps. 

The Ping Gai chicken, however, was the star of the night. Super tasty chicken and the coriander sauce was just a great complement to the dish! Such a huge serving, there was enough to make a full lunch the next day. 

Try to keep some space for the desserts, the cakes look all amazing and there is a selection rotation from time to time."}
{"text":"It was great! The atmosphere is cozy (perfect for date night) and there are a lot of sharables. I had the quinoa salad (highly recommend) and my bf had the Pad Thai (he said he has been on the hunt for a good pad Thai for YEARS and Queen Mother's Pad Thai is by far the BEST he's ever had!) We will be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! The calamari was the best I've had in the city, it literally melts in your mouth! The Ping Gai was phenomenal, i've never had such tender and juicy chicken. The staff was amazing, very friendly and helpful. I also love their social media account on Instagram, it has tonnes of helpful info like daily specials and upcoming events. Will be coming back! :)"}
{"text":"I only tried the spring rolls and the Ping Gai. But thePing Gai chicken plate was phenomenal. Crispy, juicy and an explosion of flavor. Both sauces from each dish were wonderful and complex. I will dream bout this food til I'm back in Toronto."}
{"text":"We walked by here serveral times but had always ended up at one of the cheaper Indian restaurants instead because of the price.  But today I decided to give it a try.  There is obviously a lot of fusion food on the menu as well as more traditional aisan fair.   We ordered both the fish hot pot and the Khao Soy Gai.   

The fish hot pot was particularly good. It had really nice flavor and a good bit of heat.  The Khao Soy Gai just couldn't stand up.  It didn't have nearly the flavor.  

The atmosphere is kind of trendy/hip.  Service was prompt without being intrusive, or particularly friendly.  

The only thing that would keep me from really recommending the place is that the prices are a bit high for what you get.  Lunch ended up costing $34 after tax and tip, for two.  Not horrible, but you can do as well for less."}
{"text":"The quinoa salad is fresh, generously-sized, but under-seasoned. The Ping Gai tasted good but it was quite dry and did not live up to the hype.

The menu is really diverse! Will come back to try new dishes if I'm in the area.

The employees are chill, helpful, and friendly. Be careful when venturing to the washrooms in the basement, the stairs are worn and really easy to slip on."}
{"text":"Stopped for late lunch. Good service, friendly staff. Liked kale salad, it had very tangy tasty souse, lots of pistachios and an interesting addition of green lentil. Overall - unexpected and tasty . Mussels were good - fresh in a tasty souse ( i love mussels and hate when they come in a watery over-salted souse , this one was perfect). Fried calamari were also very good and cooked from fresh, not frozen. What i didnt like were the fritters that came with mussels ( mushy, i was expecting Belgium type - crispy on the outside and soft on inside) and rose hip tea - terrible, comes from a tea bag , not tea leaves, at at a price of $3 , and smells and tastes like steamed hay. 
Wil go back for food but will stick with beer for drinks"}
{"text":"This Toronto institution is great for so many purposes - first dates, family lunches, post AGO meals, and any other reason to put delicious food in your belly. The sister of my other fav Toronto institution the Rivoli, the Queen Mum is always busy - all day long tourists, regulars and out of town frequenters keep this place thriving. 

A warm space with cozy booths, tables, and a bar set up, a surprising number of people can fit into this restaurant. There's also an upstairs patio for those few warm months we get here. But what matters of course is the food! Having tried most of the menu I can recommend a lot of things - my favourite trio is the edamame with temptingly drinkable chilli soy dipping sauce, the nam jeun with equally temptingly drinkable peanut sauce and the nam dip make a lovely start to any shareable meal. 

Another favourite of mine is their kale, roasted tomato and green lentil salad - I know it doesn't sound very exciting but it's really well balanced and dressed and filling so buyer beware, it's a full size portion and not a starter salad in my opinion. I really like their Pad Thai (tofu version for me!) as their vegetables are fresh and not overcooked. Many of my friends enjoy the Bah Me Hang too.

Many of my meat eating friends rave about the Ping Gai so I always suggest it to my companions if they're new to the Queen Mum. I've never heard anyone disappointed. I can even admit it looks delicious to this veg-head.

Drinks are well made by the staff from caesars to martinis, everything is professionally done. A small but decent and relatively well priced wine list is available as well. And of course for dessert, there's a full display of delectable cakes and pies on offer that is worth a look even if you are too full from all the other delicious food. 

My only complaint is the tables are quite small and it's tough to get your drinks and food to fit on it comfortably and if it's really busy, you'll be right next to your neighbours so it can get a bit loud and lack intimacy - but it's a small concern for such a good dining experience otherwise. 

Adorable pictures of... who else, the Queen Mum await you in the downstairs lavatories so you feel these folks care about your experience from start to finish. If you live here and haven't been there, what are you waiting for? If you've got parents or friends coming to town and you haven't taken them there - do! There's something for everyone here."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place based on reviews of my cousins and friends....I of course yelped it but like you can see it sounds good right? After a good afternoon of shopping Queen West we headed over to celebrate a cousins birthday. 
The wait was around 40 minutes, not so bad and we got great seating. The service was friendly however the food wasnt that amazing. We ordered the artichoke dip(a-ok, its not warm) and calamari for starters and I ordered the Pad Thai recommended by others and it was good but nothing that blew my mind. I would have to comment that the serving size is huge, totally worthy of family style if you go with people who actually understand the concept. 

The pricing is awesome for a restaurant like this, under $25 a person with starters and soft drinks. 

I probably wouldnt go back again for dinner because the atmosphere while cool was a little loud to carry on a conversation over dinner and the food didnt ring any bells for me. Probably a better place to meet up after work for a quick bite or drinks."}
{"text":"I went here to meet someone I had never met before. I did not enjoy myself. It is a very intimidating space, when going there alone, especially on a Saturday afternoon.

It was craZy busy too. Too busy. I sat at the bar, stayed for about a half hour and ordered a tea. My total came to about $2.55. The guy misunderstood me when I asked for my change back from my $5. He kept a dollar for himself and I only got $1.50 back. I wouldn't be too hard up on this if it wasn't for me tipping an additional 50 cents, in which his deserving of, was questionable.

I wasn't altogether there that day- my mind was somewhere else. So I didn't notice this change discrepancy until after I had left. But by default if you are a server and misunderstand the patron, you don't take money from them, you give them ALL their change and let them deal with it. Period.

I will not be returning in spite of their quinoa salad looking tasty. 

On another note, since the capacity was reaching it's limit, they had a line right behind the chairs at the bar. People kept on knocking, although accidentally, their feet against the legs of the chairs; my chair, making for an uncomfortable stay.

My recommendation for anyone venturing to the Queen Mother Cafe in the future is to go when they aren't so busy.... I guess their busy-ness speaks of the reputation their food has, as in being good, worthy of a line. And people seem to really like their atmosphere too. Guess it depends on the seat you have.

Good Luck!"}
{"text":"When in town I must make time for the Queen! Great little spot full of tasty and unique food with an even better selection of drinks!

This is one of the places you can get St-Ambroise Apricot Wheat Ale, well that I know you can, and also have some amazing options for food. From asian fusion cuisine to classic steak frites. I had only ever been for lunch but this time got to experience their dinner! The dinner menu compared to the lunch menu is a nice change of pace. The lunch menu consists of lighter fare and lighter prices, then the dinner gives more substantial meals and with that come more substantial prices. (which is fair!) 

The Atmosphere, I would describe as dark and cozy... the booths are a great size but the table seating is slightly squished for my liking, but a great way to make friends!

All in all... great spot and great food! Worth a trip in when on Queen W."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Asian fusion restaurants in Toronto. On this visit, we had the hummus dip with taro chips, the dim sum, and the rice rolls with tofu. 

Everything was served the right temperature, garnished well, and tasted delicious.

A previous visit, I enjoyed the pad Thai.

We also enjoyed the gluten free  chocolate torte. If you like dense and fudgey, this is a must."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy my lunch here at all. I can't even remember what it was I ate here but I recall vowing to never come back. 

I had one of their \"Thai\" noodle dishes and was so disappointed. I think it was the Pad Thai, but I can't be too sure as it tasted nothing like what Pad Thai should taste like. The flavours were all over the place, and I had to just add lots of lemon to be able to continue eating my meal. 

Incredibly incredibly disappointed with this place as I had been meaning to try this spot out for the longest time and was severely disappointed. I will definitely not be coming back unless the whole menu gets revamped."}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner with my hubby on the first night of our Toronto staycation.
Sat on the patio - such a lovely spot, however our table was so close to the couple next to us, we practically joined them on their first date. (Which we knew they were on because we could hear everything they said - ha!)
We ordered the sticky rice for an appetizer - I think it's gotten smaller over the years, though the peanut sauce is awesome.

I had the salmon on soba noodles - it wasn't totally cooked through and was sitting in too much watery sauce. Hubby had the pad thai - not terrible, but not great either.

So it was a bit of a meh experience - not the great time I've had there before."}
{"text":"My Sunday in Toronto started with a search for the best sticky rice in town. Unfortunately, Kuan on Yonge was filled to capacity, so the search was on. A review on Yelp and Blog TO led me to Queen Mother Cafe.

Upon arrival, one has to navigate to figure out which door to even use as there were multiple with only one being functional. Once inside, presented with a decor that was a throw back to British colonial days but was dimly lit, run down looking and a place that one might recommend for an extreme restaurant makeover. After, seeing the rather gross carpet flooring, I should have gone with my instinct to leave but was starving and decided to give it a shot.

Initial place settings were dirty - glass, plate - and were quickly replaced by the server.

The menu is a cross between Thai/Asian Fusion and typical brunch fare - eggs benedict and sandwiches. I ordered only from the Thai side of the menu starting with the sticky rice. This came served in a small toy plastic coated woven basket with lid and accompanied by peanut sauce on the side. The plastic coated old taste of the basket was liberally infused in to the rice making it unpalatable. The peanut sauce was nothing more than a reconstituted packet that one might purchase off the international section of your local grocery store.  The whole mess was just unbearable to eat.

Next up was the Dim Sum Quartet, an assortment of wonton wrapped dim sum filled with chicken and shrimp, steamed and served with soy sauce and a garlic chilli dipping sauce. Clearly this was not freshly made but frozen packaged Dim Sum that was simply reheated in a steamer. Watery soaked wonton and lacking in basic flavor.

And the grand finale was Bah Me Hang, billed as fresh thin egg noodles stir fried with bean sprouts, onions, celery, chopped peanuts, sautéed shrimp and golden sliced chicken in a spicy lime coriander sauce. The noodles were severely overcooked and mushy as was the shrimp. The golden sliced chicken resembled \"mystery meat\" more than chicken. There was nothing fresh or vibrant about this dish.

I will credit the rather young waitress with taking this last dish off my final bill, but this was simply one of the worst meals I have had in Toronto. My guess is this place is better for desert and coffee or more of the \"British\" or pub fare and one should simply stare clear of the Asian/Thia cuisine. That is assuming you can deal with the overall atmosphere and lack of cleanliness of this place."}
{"text":"Healthy food shouldn't take soooooooo long to serve.  The servers aren't bad-- they are just perpetually under-staffed to the point that I want to hang a sign in the window for them. By the time I finish my lunches there it's usually dinner time.

Then again, I can't stop going to TQM cuz the food puts a spring in my step. 

- MUST start with the white bean dip! Sadly, their fresh take on Terra Chips are too brittle for the dense dip. It's so salty and goood!

-  Quinoa salad (HELLO, gluten-free!) with pepitas (pumpkin seeds), a little feta, cranberries, bibb

- cold spring rolls

- The Ping Gang crispy chicken. I always convince someone else to order this so that I can maintain that I ordered a healthy meal while stealing from said friend's plate. 

(The pad thai was way tomato-ey and a bit too sweet. But some make like that.)

I'll be back, and when I do, I know I'll get antsy once again."}
{"text":"Put simply, I LOVE this place.

I always thought that I would have my engagement party at The Queen Mother Cafe one day, but that was when I still believed in romance, marriage and true love.  Now, it's at least my number 1 death-row last-meal pick.

I always order the same thing.  Not to say that the entire menu isn't amazing, because it is, according to everyone I bring there.  I just LOVE the sticky rice (which comes steamed in a cute straw basket served with peanut sauce), the Nam Jeun (crispy Laotian spring rolls), and a cup of peppermint tea with honey.  I never need to look at a menu.  It's the perfect meal for me.  If you have room for it, they have a glorious dessert case.  If you don't have room for it, they are still fun to look at and dream.

In the past, I have celebrated many important occasions there with loved ones, and ones I used to love, and the staff always went above and beyond.  Once, they even placed fresh flowers on all the plates they brought to our table for my birthday/anniversary.  And when my younger brother graduated from Ryerson Film school, we sat together as a family on their absolutely magical and intimate back patio, which is the best on a warm summer night.  You feel like you're in a quiet English garden somewhere, and not the downtown core.

A perfect date place, if you still believe in all that \"love\" crap."}
{"text":"Tried this a few days ago with a friend. Have to say this is the worst pad thai I've had and I have Thai food pretty often. It seemed as though they made zero effort with the dish - very oily, large peanut chunks and  chicken chunks. I had two servers, the man was polite but curt and the woman was friendly and kind. The one star is for her."}
{"text":"Environment: Has more of a bar type feel than a fine dining restaurant. The patio in the summer however is excellent and is worth checking out. There is plenty of seating area. 

Service: Service was great. Both times I have gone the servers were very friendly and accommodating with good recommendations. Even when busy they are able to be reasonably attentive. 

Food: I've had the Chicken pad Thai and the Ping Gai during my visits here and both are excellent items that I would recommend and would get again."}
{"text":"Decided to check this restaurant out after reading about it in BlogTO. My husband and I LOVE Thai food but this place definitely did Thai food a big disservice. Every item we ordered was disappointing. The waitress was nice and the food came out relatively quick, but I'd rather wait for better cooked food. 

For appetizers, we ordered Sticky Rice with peanut sauce dip and Wasabi Guacamole. Both sad imitations of what they could be. First of all, the rice was sticky but ridiculously bland and dry. The peanut sauce tasted pedestrian, like they just mixed peanuts with coconut milk. No depth whatsoever. I've tasted better sticky rice at a Thai place in Whitby, of all places. Second of all, the guacamole was fine. It was fresh but why stick the Wasabi label on it if you can't even taste it? Not even a hint of it. I expected a sharp hit of wasabi with the guacamole but tasted like avocado blended with no other ingredient. Couldn't even taste any lime. It also came with taro chips. Very dry. Taro chips and guacamole do not go together, especially when neither have any salt or seasoning. 

For mains, my husband ordered Crispy Calamari since he wasn't that hungry. I ordered Khao Soy Gai. Sounded amazing. Spicy broth with ginger, Thai herbs, tumeric, curry and coconut milk. Uh no. Tasted like watery curry powder with dry noodles. The noodles was the wrong choice because it can't soak up any of the sauce. Where's the thick rich coconut? Where's the  fresh Thai herb flavours? Very disappointing. For the first time, did not finish a Thai noodle dish, packed up and actually decided to throw it out because who wants to eat a watery mess? The calamari was fine. The batter was crispy but this dish can't save this restaurant.

If you want a poor imitation of \"Asian Fusion and Thai\", come here. I can't believe any of the positive reviews here. It was two years ago that I read exciting reviews on BlogTO. What happened? ANY other Thai place, even the fast food place Thai Express, would be better than this place. Plus, this place doesn't even sell Thai beer like Singha. Wow. Won't be coming here ever again."}
{"text":"Lots of tasty options and a great quirky vibe. I find it easy to bring different people here because there is something they will like, and the service is great. Great kale salad for when I am being good, comforting Bah Me Hang noodles when I need them. Spectacular spring rolls keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Two words: pad thai.

Two more words: secret patio.

A bunch more words: the Queen Mother is a gem.  The decor, atmosphere, service and food are all awesome.  Honestly if you go here and don't have the pad thai, I am going to hunt you down and kill you.  I kid, I kid - but it's that good.  Not sure what they make the sauce out of, but I think it flips the same switch in your brain that makes crack addicts so addicted.

And for dessert, a fine selection of Dufflet cakes will make you fat - and sassy.

Oh and did I mention secret summertime patio?  Accessible only by an underground passageway, you'll feel as if you're going through Fred Penner's hollowed-out tree and arriving in Mr. Rogers' fantasyland, except with better service & food and fewer hand puppets.  Surrounded by trellis'd foliage and flowers, it's a great place for an afternoon drink.  In the evenings the patio lanterns come on and the ambiance is exquisite - perfect for a post-movie dinner with your love.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A great little cafe for brunch on the weekend!

I had a BLT w/ Yukon fries, which was excellent. It's served on a fresh baguette with Chipotle mayo and what may be the tastiest bacon I've ever had in my life.

Although you have to navigate a series of underground tunnels to sit out back on the patio, it's quiet and perfect for an afternoon meal.

I also love the nearby wifi network called \"Queen Mothership\" which has absolutely NOTHING to do w/ the cafe! Exactly what I'd do if I lived upstairs."}
{"text":"PING GAI CHICKEN! C'mon, you have to admit this dish is so fun to say. It does live up to its name as it is absolutely delicious! It is rare to find a place that can cook the chicken perfectly - extremely moist and flavorful. This is definitely one of those hearty home cook meals that will always make your day better. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Asian Fusion, so when it was suggested that we go to Queen Mother Cafe for dinner, I was easily persuaded. 

I can see this as maybe a good first few dates type location - I'm a fan of the dark ambiance, it's romantic but not in a cheesy or cliche way - I'm going to go with \"romantic casual\". Combine that with good service, and you're pretty much guaranteed a good experience! 

I'm also a fan of the large menu and drink list. I had a Thai inspired chicken/noodle dish, (unfortunately I forget the name...) but it was really great! It was in a soupy broth, which was so good that I just ate it with a spoon when the noodle contents were gone. I also saw that the person next to us had what looked like a great lemongrass soup, which I will definitely order the next time I stop by. 

I can definitely see myself checking out Queen Mother again soon!"}
{"text":"This place was never a \"destination\" spot for me, but having lived 2 minutes away at one point in my life, you tend to run out of options. I've probably been here a dozen times, which should be an indication that I need to go to the gym more, but that's another story.

Long story short, you need to order the following:

1. Get the Ping Gai. Tasty, moist chicken served with rice and spicy sauce. 
2. Calamari. It's pretty standard but they do it proper. Lightly breaded, and cooked perfectly.
3. Quinoa Salad - Add chicken breast.  This plate is huge and tastes amazing. Huge chunks of feta, with cilantro.

As a note, if you're not from Toronto but looking for \"authentic\" asian food, this is not your spot. You may think it is, but trust me, its not. Don't panic, Chinatown is just a few blocks west ."}
{"text":"It was nice Thai food. Looks nice cafe and good location. I got khao soy gai . It was not very delicious but yummy yummy!! next time I wanna try Pad Thai ."}
{"text":"Excellent place for lunch.  We all had the signature chicken dish as well as sharing the pad Thai. The food was delicious and nothing was left on anyone's plate.  Service was fast and friendly and the owner Andre was extremely pleasant and recommended our meals"}
{"text":"Pretty nasty pad thai. The meat  tasted dry and the sauce was most likely from a  mix. The soup was ok, but everything was expensive  and the service was very slow.  My father got a curry that was really bland as well. The menu had a bunch of crap about the British royal family on it. . . .that alone is enough to make me lose my appetite  . I think this is one of those places for white people who are afraid to eat real Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"After a great tour of the Kubrick exhibit at TIFF, we needed lunch. Heading north, fancying a pint, we landed at this landmark. Having not been here in well over a decade, I was curious to see how the Queen has aged. As is to be expected, she is timeless. Our pink corduroy wearing hostess/server was lovely. She initially sat us right beside the kitchen, but was accommodating when I was fussy and asked to be moved closer to the front window. She warned us and was extremely apologetic about some very boisterous regulars who have not mastered the concept of indoor voices. They were, in fact, pretty annoying, but we can't hold that against the joint. And we can't say we weren't forewarned. I ordered the vegetarian Nam Dip and really enjoyed it. It was nothing fancy, but the ingredients were appropriately fresh and the dip was tasty. My friend had the infamous pad thai. I tried it but wasn't in love. All in all, it was a pleasant lunch."}
{"text":"We didn't eat but spent a few hours escaping the cold with some friends. Staff was friendly, but this whole place is a blast from the past (great if that's what you are looking for).  Overall beer/drink selection leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Ping Gai. try it, love it. 
On a lunchtime walk, I took a friend to this hidden gem and forced her to order the ping gai. We take it back to work and go to eat at our desks. About 3 hours later she calls me in tears because it was soooo good but she waited till it got cold to eat, I have to promise to take her with me the next time I go. 

Basicially everyone who I take here loves it, and has to come back and bring other people wit them. I can't say much because about 4 months ago that was me. Some advice when you go try the ping gai, if there are 4 of you order 4 ping gai, if you are the one person who wants to try something else, I am sorry for you, everything is good maybe even great, but the ping gai is magical, it is so good you miss it when you don't have it."}
{"text":"Ping Gai - OMG!  One of the best tasting meals I've had in ages!!!  Recommended by our AirBNB hostess, we came here for dinner and left feeling like we are just let in on a huge secret:  eat here for the yummiest chicken in Canada!   Asian Fusion
mostly with an excellent steak & fries as back-up.  Food would be 6 stars. Weak drinks would be 4 stars.  So a five-star dinner!"}
{"text":"Ok, so it's a little pricey for what you probably expect given its decor...a little small, a little dingy...on Queen West where the hipsters are hanging out, but the food here is sooooo good.

Last time I was here I had the ping gai - the flavour just explodes in your moth. This time around, I went with three friends and we ALL got the pad thai. It was that good. However, if you order it hot, they dont just add chili or anything, they add the hot sauce, so it might mask its original taste. 

I got a drink this time too - orange creamscicle. Not very sweet but very strong in alcohol, despite the tiny tiny martini glass.

$30 after tax and tip for a padthai and one drink is not cheap, but I enjoyed every chewing and sipping."}
{"text":"The Ping gai dish is tasty, but service is really lacking.  Feels like the customer is a complete after thought or could depend on the server.  We just kept waiting or when she did come it wasn't pleasant."}
{"text":"Ping gal is a revelation.  Really great!"}
{"text":"Queen Mother Cafe looks like a dingy dive bar, but actually serves \"Asian Fusion\" cuisine, which confuses my concept of how the world works. The interior is dark and kitschy, complete with booths and carpeted floors, but the menu offers meals ranging from Pad Thai to roti and steak. 

I came here to catch up with a friend for dinner after spending some time at the AGO. I had the Nam Dip -- basically three fresh spring rolls with peanut sauce -- which were a little bit dry and didn't taste as fresh as I would have liked, and seemed a little pricy for $9. Also, service was incredibly slow and a little thoughtless -- my friend ordered the Kale Salad and asked for the dressing on the side, but the salad came fully dressed, and when we finished our meals, her plate was taken away while mine sat in front of me for another 10 minutes. 

Another thing to note is that the place is quite dark and does get rather loud and crowded in the evenings, so having an intimate conversation here may not be ideal. What Queen Mother does get points for is location and variety, plus I saw lots of cakes in a display case and who doesn't like cake...

A decent casual spot to meet anytime, as they do lunch, dinner, and late night here, and the menu offers something for everyone. Also a brunch menu on Sundays, I believe."}
{"text":"I decided to give the Queen Mother a try while waiting for my concert to start at Nathan Philip Square.

Once we were seated, we waited a bit for a the waitress to get to our table.
I ordered the soup of the day: Chicken coconut,  the calamari and a white Sangria.

My Sangria was alright but did not warrant its $7 price tag. The soup was bland and it felt as if it was just made of old scraps instead of fresh ingredients. My calamari however was perfect: golden crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.

Next time I will probably give the Ping Gang crispy chicken a try. I stole a bite from my friend and it was honestly the juiciest chicken I had even tasted!"}
{"text":"Sadly I have to downgrade Queen Mother Cafe to a 3 star.

A bunch of us came here for a late snack after an Elite event since their kitchen closes late.

Services still top notch and QMC is definitely great for groups as our waitress able to provide us all with a separate bills.

However the food was just disappointing.

Nam Dip ($8.95) has this dried rice wrapping and my Khao Soy Gai ($13.95)  was just a mess of overcooked and soggy noodle in the bland broth.

The Fried Calamari though tasted great, should have ordered that instead.

Maybe I should have stick with Ping Gai which was so delicious last time I ate here?! But I do want to try different items on the menu...."}
{"text":"A real hidden gem!!!! When I first entered this cafe with tiny door, I thought it was just a normal cafe.
When I said I want a take-out latte. They said we don't do take-out.
Wow, how could a cafe without taking-out service.
Then I sat down and had a look of the menu.
Thanks to the quick glance, I decided to have lunch here.
There are variety of Asian food from Laos/ Thailand/Vietnam/ Sri-lanka.....
Yujie ordered a VEGETARIAN NAM DIP(soft rice paper rolls filled with tofu, bean sprouts, cucumber, lettuce, vermicelli noodles, carrot, bell peppers, fresh mint and coriander, served with sweet and spicy peanut sauce 8.50) I had a KHAO SOY GAI (traditional northern Laotian dish of chicken simmered in a spicy broth of ginger, fresh Thai herbs, turmeric, curry and coconut milk, served on a bed of soft thin egg noodles, bean sprouts, watercress, garnished with mint, shallots, marinated bok choy and fresh coriander 11.95) So yummy !!!!!!! Highly recommend this Laos Dish to all, very creamy and very curry, very mild.

Tanya is our server, she has amazing hair, wow...purple. She's really nice :P

Do I forget to mention the coffee here?
THE LATTE IN A BOWL IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!! The barista draw a rabbit on my coffee!!!!!!!! So impressive
Love here, must come back"}
{"text":"We came here as group 8 at 6pm on Thursday and the patio was all full so we sat inside. The menu is mainly Thai-Lao flavours with a mix of western and other asian flavours. I've heard the Ping Gai is the most popular dish but I felt like noodle that day so I ordered the Bah Mi Hang, which is a stir fry thin egg noodle. It wasn't crunchy like the Cantonese version more similar to a pad thai, which is still good no complaints. But not something I'll come back for. The others ordered the pad thai and liked it as well. The apps we ordered was good - Wasabi guac with taro chips, sticky rice with peanut sauce. I like their sangria which you can order by glass or pitcher. The overall experience was good. It's one of those places where you don't love it enough to bring people but wouldn't be opposed to coming again."}
{"text":"Service was very slow on a Friday evening. I had to wave down the server and do a hand motion to get a menu. We tried the Ping Gai and the Ba Mee Haeng. The sauce that came with the Ping Gai was excellent but the chicken itself was pretty standard. The Ba Mee Haeng was tasty but seemed like something I could cook at home."}
{"text":"Having strayed from the path (ordering something other than the pad thai), I was a little disappointed. Serves me right. There's no way a chicken salad sandwhich could live up the high expectations I walked in with. Regardless, this place still does the job. I miss their patio. Come back summer, come back."}
{"text":"Great desserts. Food is not bad. Service by the wannabe art students and actors, not so great.  ALways a good location, but stick to the dessert."}
{"text":"Last night, I attempted to have dinner here with a friend who I haven't seen in 10 years. We arrived around 7 pm and each got a beer while we started to catch up with one another. Admittedly, we both have loud voices. It was also a Saturday night in a full restaurant on Queen street in the middle of a major city.  A middle-aged man with a gray beard asked us about 20 minutes in if we can speak more quietly. We were confused but agreed that we would try. After the restaurant got louder, the music that turned up, and more people were there, we were approached after about another 20 minutes and asked again to be quiet. When we objected that it was louder in the bar, they indicated that we probably should just leave. It was both very Canadian in terms of it's passive-aggressiveness and incredibly rude, considering that we were in a restaurant in the middle of the city on a weekend evening. We decided to leave.

On the plus side, the beer that I had was very good and the woman who was my server was very nice and appeared horrified when I tipped her directly and told her that we had to leave.

As a side note? I have hearing loss. I can't hear in environments with a lot of ambient noise unless my conversational partner speaks up. So thanks for making your establishment ableist as well as rude, dude.

That said, will i return? Nah. We spent $60 for dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is place isofficially my latest favorite restaurant in Toronto.

Casual atmosphere but great service make this a must dine on Queen Street. I have had lunch outside on the patio which is wonderfully private and also dinner a few times in the main restaurant. The signature dish of Ping Gai is sensational with some of the most tender and tasty chicken you will ever taste. They don't have it on now but come winter ask for their scallop risotto which is absolutely one of the best entrees I have had in years.

For a very reasonable price and great downtown location it doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"Great food and service was awesome as well. We tried the pad Thai and khao soy gai. Both were awesome but I think the khao soy gai won!  Dessert was also top notch."}
{"text":"The Queen Mother seems to have been around forever... and given that it's outlasted its namesake (there was a time when it seemed she was immortal), it's nearly iconic in Toronto.  The Ping Gai is excellent.  It's all I ever have.  I have no idea what the other food is like.  I really don't care.

The cocktails are above average.  Certainly they know how to mix a Manhattan, though I've often found their Gin and Tonics flat and too weak for my tastes.  

I've been served by the same person the last three visits and she's absolutely charming.  Most attentive and almost seems to care that you enjoy your experience."}
{"text":"In a strip of Queen St. that has mediocre food, this restaurant is OK.  Like the ambiance of the restaurant and staff are pretty nice (they seem to leave you alone!), but the food is nothing to write home about.  There's a lot of Asian fusion places along Queen and the food here is comparable to something you'd get at Spring Rolls (that's unfortunately not a compliment!).  Not much passion in the food - I would describe it as mediocre to good - there is always one thing off with the dishes.  The noodle dishes are OK, not a lot of flavour.  The curried quinoa was also OK but lacking spices.  The goat cheese artichoke dip was tasty, but the accompanying taro chips were a bit too greasy."}
{"text":"Everyone I know SWEARS by Queen Mother's (\"the queen mum\") Pad Thai and were I fan of pad thai in the first place, I'm sure I'd love it. But I'm especially drawn to Queen Mother's daily specials, which include creative soups and creamy pasta plates. I once had a plate of tortellini with roasted red pepper, zucchini, asparagus and cherry tomatoes that was drizzled with a creamy tomato sauce that I'll never forget. I haven't had it there since but I really wish they'd bring it back!

Make sure you leave room for dessert as they have an extensive/revolving dessert menu (you can go up to the counter and ogle the full cakes to pick one out) that's out of this world!"}
{"text":"Sauntered into this quaint joint based off the recommendation of a local store front I was buying souvenirs from. Great vibe, very low key and laid back - very friendly staff. 

The food was amazing! I had the Monday night special, a linguini dish. This dish was simple yet had phenomenal flavor, linguini with zucchini, shiitake mushrooms and artichokes. I finished with the pink velvet cake for dessert - moist, delicious and not too sweet. 

I will definitely be back to this little gem on my next Toronto trip."}
{"text":"This was my first time in Toronto and my first restaurant I ate at. It was recommended by a local so I thought, why not? I typically don't spend a lot of money on Asian fusion as it's usually overpriced but I figured i'm on a weekend getaway. The food was delicious, I got the Pad Thai which had nice portions but wasn't even remotely spicy enough to be Thai food. For dessert I had a piece of the triple chocolate cake, was delicious but most likely from a box, should have gotten the lemon pie, which looked homemade.

After reading the reviews of the Queen Mother I just have to laugh at the reviews who call the restaurant, kitschy and like a dingy dive bar. This place was the furthest thing from a dive bar, but considering how upscale the neighborhood I imagine the Queen Mother would be considered low-class compared to other places to eat on Queen Street W."}
{"text":"I didn't really like the food here. I thought the place was kind of cool in the sense that it's an English style pub with pretty diverse things on the menu (quinoa salad to pad thai) - but the food didn't do it for me. 

The portions were massive, but the taste was mediocre and not worth the amount you pay for it. The dessert we ordered was too sweet and tasted like butter and sugar, not cake. Not sure how they made it but totally didn't cut it for me! Service was alright though."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to give it 5 stars - as I love almost everything about this place.

But I had one experience where my sticky rice ball dish was not good. The rice is served in this adorable little bamboo basket, but at the heart of the rice - it was rock hard. It had dried out on the inside, so I had to waste 20-30% of the main component of this dish.

But that was just one time out of several... so here's the experience of the other 9/10 times:

ATMOSPHERE: Dimly lit, part nostalgic, part hipster and kinda romantic. Generally busy and lively atmosphere. Great place on Queen Street and in the heart of the downtown core. 

SERVICE: Very relaxed. But service is friendly and courteous.

PRICE: Average. Matches it's atmosphere.

FOOD: They serve Thai food with twist - they offer a fusion menu. One of my fave pad thai is served here. I love their pad thai more than Salad King's. More flavour and ingredients here! 

The serve a large selection of Dufflet cakes - so it's one of the few places that have a larger selection of sweets.

Also, I love their brunch!"}
{"text":"The pad Thai was great, but the menu was a bit erratic. The art displayed was a homey touch, but it didn't really fit the vibe of the food."}
{"text":"I would have never known this place even served food had a relative not taken my husband and I. His recommendation was either the Ping Gai or Pad Thai. I've had my share of Pad Thai back at home, so I figured why not? Ping Gai it is!! And YES it was! It was very very good and loved the light crispiness of the chicken when it came out.

I also had the Crispy Calamari. Ok, now I've eaten fried calamari EVERYWHERE. This is by far THE BEST! It's not hard, it's not dry, it's not chewy. The exterior has a nice crisp (not crunch) and the inside is so soft and melts in your mouth!! That's right! Calamari that melts in your mouth...is that EVEN possible?? YES IT IS! This appetizer will SERIOUSLY not disappoint.
