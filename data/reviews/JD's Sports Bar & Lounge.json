{"text":"My brother got married last weekend and was staying at the Plaza. We ended up at JDs for a celebratory early dinner because Remington's was closed on Sundays.  We seated ourselves on the patio area and it would be several minutes before our server Josh appeared. I told him that we were celebrating my brother and his new wife married that afternoon.  Josh responded rather sarcastically  \"Good luck\". We were all a little stunned by this remark. I don't remember my exact response but it was something like \"at least pretend to be happy for them\". Josh held up his left hand to show his wedding band and told us \"I'm married ... Good luck\".  Wow. What a crappy server. You have marriage troubles? So sorry, but don't project your negativity and sarcasm on someone else's happy day. Fake it till you make it, buddy.  We ordered drinks but never got a glass of water as you would receive in every other American restaurant.  We ordered our food and I think ended up putting for a second round of drinks at the same time. It was at this point hat Josh seemed to try to turn it around. All of the sudden he was trying to be friendly - saying he would ensure our drinks were perfect blah blah.  Food comes along....Ho hum. My brother had the salmon with veggies. You know those frozen mixed vegetables that come in the microwaveable steamer bags by Green Giant? Yeah, he got those. At least that's what the side looked like to me. I had tomato, onion and green pepper fajitas with some shrimp- oh wait, sorry, \"Shrimp fajitas\" is how they were advertised on the menu. With Mission brand flour tortillas. My boyfriend's Cuban sandwich looked good but he only shrugged when I asked how it tasted. That was the general consensus amongst all of us: the food was \"Meh\". My boyfriend quipped \"Coco's by any other name...\"  So We brought in a little cake and Josh is trying to be \"Super Friendly Helpful Server\" now and offered to bring us plates and even offered to cut the cake for us. I guess he finally realized his tip was on the line. I recognize that he did try salvage his service but it was too little too late.  In the end we had a $200 bill, half was drinks. The drinks were good. The food was overpriced,  bland fare comparable to Coco's. The service was a little slow. It was a Sunday afternoon, no Big Game was on, not crowded. We weren't in a rush or anything, but it just added to the poor experience.  Hope Josh gets some job and marriage counseling to help with his attitude. As for us, we will never, ever return to JD's."}
{"text":"We frequent Jds often.    Today:  Enjoyed my spinach salad, except for the piece that I found stuck in my tooth after leaving the establishment!  Not their fault.  That's what spinach does!  My friend enjoyed his French onion soup.  The music was heard but not overwhelming as you find with some places.      We could actually hear each other speaking!  Do some people seek out the places with very loud music so they don't have to communicate with each other?  Just asking.  The dark wood decor was very relaxing.    Bar tender/manager Terry is the best."}
{"text":"This is a cozy place for locals and hotel guest to hang out with no pressure. The best part if having Holly singing on Friday and Saturday.  It livens up the place. Too bad unless you know about it there is no sign on a marque for people traveling in the area.  That would be my only suggestion."}
{"text":"Good pub faire in a decent setting. I had sliders with a fruit salad. All ingredients were fresh and tasty. My experience last week was good, with friendly and efficient service. Although, I was a single diner arriving at 2:20 pm on a quiet Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Don't bother. My husband and I, headed to a movie that night, chose J.D.'s for the \"Fish Fry\" on a Friday night that I found on an onlne search. We were completely ignored by the staff for so long with no greeting, menus or drinks we got up and left. Never again."}
{"text":"Two stars for the food, 5 stars for the bartenders and free popcorn. Sent the dog biscuit dry chicken back, got dry flavorless ribs in its stead. Don't eat here. But great place to come for drinks!"}
{"text":"JD's is located inside the Scottsdale Plaza Resort and is the place to get a drink or a meal if you don't want to leave the resort.  This particular day, I had been on a long run in Paradise Valley and needed to refuel before lazing around the pool with my book for the afternoon.  I seated myself at the bar and waited.  And waited.  And waited. I knew they saw me come in, as the hostess greeted me.  Several people were working in the not-crowded restaurant area.  No one seemed to be working at the bar, though!  Finally, after literally ten minutes, a woman came back and asked for my drink order.  FYI, the Leinenkeugel Sunset Wheat is always $3 a pint.  I didn't see this until after I ordered a $5.50 bottle of Sierra Nevada for my one midday vacation beer.  Oh well.    I ordered the veggie wrap.  Lettuce, tomato, sprouts, avocado, cucumber, all chopped up with a side of spicy cheesy ranch for dipping. This was perfect and huge. I give the food five stars, and the slow service two.  Service would NOT keep me from returning, though, as they were very nice."}
{"text":"Par for the course from the most boujee \"resort\" I've ever been to. I got some nachos because none of the food sounded good. Got gas station nachos. The servers are very nice and gracious. I feel bad they have to serve sub par food in a sub par dive bar at a sub par \"resort\". Not even real cheese. If you want protein or even veggies it's an extra fiver on an 11 dollar ask. If you want resort prices and a motel feel then you will be right at home here."}
{"text":"Stayed at this resort for a conference and spent a lot of time eating at JD's!  Servers seemed very attentive and pleasant, food was fine quality, price was reasonable, and the atmosphere is great.  There are huge TVs all around showing whatever sports events are on at the time, buttery and salty popcorn at every table -- pretty good experience all around.  I didn't have a bad meal, though I thought that their monthly special (a Hawaiian bison burger with sweet potato fries) was the winner of the weekend.  It's not likely that I'll be back to the Scottsdale Plaza unless I come to another conference, but if I do, I'll have no problem eating at JD's.  EDIT: Updated to drop from 4- to 3-stars because they don't have the Pac-12 channel in the sports bar, but they do have it in all the hotel rooms.  What??!!"}
{"text":"Extreme lack of service. We waited around 15 minutes after getting drinks to even see somebody who worked there and I had to shout across a few tables to get the ladies attention. The man and his son next to us were in the same boat as us. If you have lots of time to kill and don't have any expectations, this place would good."}
{"text":"For my 1300th review, I am going to review a lounge named after me...?!  :) Awesome!  I found this place via Groupon.  It's a small lounge/bar area in the Scottsdale Plaza Hotel.  There's a small bar sized (6 ft) pool table in the lounge as well as a few TV's so you can watch sports.  During Happy Hour it gets pretty busy.  During my visits, I sampled the following menu items:  Nachos http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j-d-s-lounge-scottsdale?select=NoabkdWqBta-5RRtK-9opg#NoabkdWqBta-5RRtK-9opg  Potato Skins http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j-d-s-lounge-scottsdale?select=BhrLIs6tTlghmU_u3AuU-A#BhrLIs6tTlghmU_u3AuU-A http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j-d-s-lounge-scottsdale?select=5IOo_SDPNd1AfPEdQwNzwg#5IOo_SDPNd1AfPEdQwNzwg  Cheese Sticks http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j-d-s-lounge-scottsdale?select=gfj_9__b4wBDoFmKVNq1IQ#gfj_9__b4wBDoFmKVNq1IQ  The food was average.  The Potato Skins were bland and quite small.  The Cheese Sticks were just OK.....so were the Nachos.  For a sports bar type lounge, that surprised me.  Usually, they get the bar food down pat.    The service was so/so too.  One visit, it was good....the other it was bad.  There are too many other choices in town.  Return Factor - 30%"}
{"text":"Don't eat here. Music was pounding. Servers were not helpful and will ignore you when you try to flag them down. After 2 hours and no food, it was time the leave. Our waitress couldn't even split a check correctly. When one of us paid in cash the waitress pocketed it and charged my friend with $73 of food we never got. We still haven't gotten our money back."}
{"text":"The reason you get two stars here and not one is the fact that the wait staff is good and the food was decent. However the decor is drab, and well past it's prime. I was here for a conference, and therefore there was not too much of choice to get a cold one and watch the game. There were several TV's, although most of them were small and this place is pretty crowded when you get 15 or 20 people inside. The food was pretty good I must admit, but again the stale green carpet and dark wood paneling leave a little to be desired."}
{"text":"Still having the ND game watch parties here. They haven't really appreciated our business this year. No more Saturday night games. They have a band now, so go elsewhere or stay home. Food is better this year, but service is still very slow ... you may die of thirst before you get a drink!  I always used to order the wonderful gelato but it's so darn cold on here today, I have to skip ... and it's 80 degrees outside! Turn down your a/c folks!"}
{"text":"Veggie tacos consist of lettuce,tomato, and sour cream. Veggie tacos are also knows as fries apparently.  Skip if possible."}
{"text":"Ate here as we were at a conference and did not have a bunch of time in between sessions. It is just ok not great not horrible. The free popcorn was yummy and the perfect amount of salt. The chicken fingers I split with a coworker were extremely overcooked and dry. Ok when you are rushing between sessions."}
{"text":"This was an incredibly mediocre experience. I am trying to find words to say and things to write, but everything was so incredibly plain and unimpressive that I am not inspired to write anything great or profound. We had a party of 8 and the service was fine. The decor was pretty dated. I had a salad but don't really remember much about it. I'm going to stop now because I have nothing productive to offer, it was that unmemorable."}
{"text":"For bar food, it's pretty darn good. I definitely would like to acknowledge the amazing service by Anna our waitress! She was warm, friendly and knew when to check on us. She wasn't too talkative and that was great because I was having a business dinner after and event. Maybe she knew  Any way, I really enjoyed having her as our waitress.   This place is pretty large and has both bar and table seating. It has a bar feel to it though for sure. I went back the second night and they had a guy playing and singing. He was pretty good and it wasn't too loud or too low. It was perfect! The food is okay. I had a burger with gluten free bread and fries. The fries weren't as hot as I like but that's just me  I would definitely come back again and would recommend eating or hanging out for a drink if you don't want to be out and just want to go back to your room afterwards. They also have free hot  popcorn!! The smell hits you when you arrive in the foyer of the reception area and literally makes you want some. Great way to pull people into the bar because you will want some popcorn when you arrive!!"}
{"text":"The bartender was short rude and wanted to get me the heck outta there. I arrived 20 minutes before closing. I confirmed they were still serving food and drinks. Given the \"yes\" answer, I ordered a grilled cheese and a beer. I found it kinda weird she served me a beer in a to go cup but didn't think twice about it until my food was plopped down on the counter as if I had ordered it to go... Well, guess you're pushing me along.  Too bad, because I was looking for a \"go to\" place while I'm staying here on an extended stay.   **work on customer service**"}
{"text":"Here's the description of JD's from Scottsdale Plaza's website: \"J.D.'s Lounge Enjoy the atmosphere of an English Sports Pub at J.D.'s Lounge at the Scottsdale Plaza: shoot a game of pool, play a few holes of Golden Tee, catch some sports action on five large TV's and choose from a fine selection of beers on tap all accompanied by the best free popcorn around. Open at 11 a.m. to midnight, daily\"  Pretty much sums up my numerous visits there during my stay for one night at Scottsdale Plaza. The food was good, better than your average bar/pub food. We got the Southwest Chicken Sandwich and Tuna Sandwich. The tuna wasn't really flavorful, kinda bland. Nothing special. The Southwest Chicken was good, but messy. It fell apart really easily. Chicken was cooked perfectly though, not dried out at all. The fries were okay, would prefer them to taste more fresh to order, but instead they were sort of stale.  The favorite is the $4 schooner of the Sunset Wheat. Such an amazing deal! We got that at the start of our day and end of our night."}
{"text":"I ate here two nights in a row while attending a conference at this venue.   The staff were friendly, not very expedient, but we were a large party and they were nice.   First night, I ordered a burger and fries. It was better than fast food, but not a great burger. The fries were quite good.   Second night, I ordered a chicken pot pie. The presentation was amazing, more what I would expect from a resort restaurant, but not necessarily from the lounge at that resort. The presentation is where my amazement stopped. The flavoring of the pie was quite good, but the chicken was way overcooked. I mean so dry and stringy and chewy and gross. My friend had ordered another chicken dish and reported the same.   The atmosphere is nice, and if you're looking to drink and have not great food, you're good. Stay away from the chicken."}
{"text":"The waitstaff here has been so friendly and awesome. Had a club sandwich, French onion soup, and the tacos.    Chicken Tacos are huge and have good flavor. The soup was very savory, on the saltier side, but I love salt.   This has been a good little spot to kill time at the plaza resort."}
{"text":"This pub was great, but the food was not that great. They're open late plus they offered us a 15% off coupon! There are numerous big flatscreens all around, which made it great for grabbing lunch, beer and some sports. They have a Sunset Wheat that's pretty much like a hefeweizen for $3 for a pint. Great deal in my book.   The food was OK. The service for the food was a tad slow but maybe because the pub was packed at the time. The ranch was delicious, totally made my meal."}
