{"text":"Looks like a 80's Fern Bar but the Indian buffet at lunch was surprisingly good.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ok... just as a preamble, I'll start by saything that I'm not going to comment at all on Nathan's the restaurant.  This is really part of my current series of Downtown Calgary Lounge/Pub reviews.  What I would say though is that it is pretty funny to now see Nathans (which used to be a kind of a old school 80's Irish Pub like lounge/restaurant), now with new ownership, rebranded as 'Nathan's Tikka House' (think strip mall Indian food with ubiquitous 'lunch buffet').    What I can absolutely tell you is that (at least with respect to the lounge side) some things never change.  First the good news... Nathans is about the only place I can think of that has Big Rock Brewery's 'McNally's Extra Ale' on tap - from one of Calgary's premier, truely world class, breweries, McNally's is one of their flagship labels that has always done well at exhibition but for whatever reason has never really caught on with consumers (who are much more likely to buy Traditional or Grasshopper Wheat Ale).  To me, McNally's is really worth the trip.... maybe the only reason...  Now the bad news(ish).. if you're looking to hide out some place where no one will ever see you have a beer, Nathan's is definitely your place.  Many afternoons (even after work...) there will be no more than 2 or 3 people in Nathan's (and one of them will be the bartender!).  It has that tired 80's feel throughout (sorry David G., with all respect, \"great atmosphere/ambiance\"?? really?  if you're comparing it to a Royal Canadian Legion branch or 'pub night' at a retirement park maybe, but otherwise I just don't see how you get there) and you you can't help but feel... that at any moment... suddenly... without any warning... absolutely nothing will happen.  You're nearly always right.    In fairness, service is always decent (but then, when it's just you, the server and the bartender, how couldn't it be??).  If you're looking for somewhere out of the way and quiet where you can go have a beer and not run into your boss (or anyone else), Nathan's is your place!  ...otherwise you'd probably want to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"One door west of Local 522 you'll find a restaurant with an interesting split personality! It smells like the Indian food buffet they serve every lunch, but looks like part diner, part family restaurant, part pub that serves Jack Daniel shot special when goals are scored during Flames games and who's bar has Sheesha pipe clusters to the sides. Yes, you read that last sentence correctly! I can't discern who they are trying to target, but I am entertained by the fact it looks like they are trying to satisfy everyone. E for effort!  First off beer is reasonably priced. I arrived just before 5 pm and was able to get a Keith's for $4.25, even after happy hour it was $6.56. The food was alright. We had wings, dry ribs, calamari and other standard pub food. It was nothing special, but after a few pints my tastes buds could really care less. The service was mixed. On the one hand they are very friendly yet on the other they can leave you hanging for a long time without checking up.   Though I would not frequent this restaurant I think it would be a fun option if you are looking for cheap beer and a place after work that will have tables available, but are willing to sacrifice an upscale atmosphere and being immersed in a plume Indian food essence while you drink.  It's not for everyone, but giving it 2.5 stars and may be back ... perhaps next year if the Flames are doing well enough."}
{"text":"This place is actually called Nathan's Tikka Haus. I walked around downtown Calgary looking for a decent Indian lunch buffet. Went into a couple of places and walked right out...$17 for lunch buffet is ridiculous in my opinion. Stumbled into Nathan's and they were just wrapping up the lunch buffet. Was able to get a carry-out box for $10. Dine-in is $13. Not sure what kind of cuisine is on the menu or why this isn't in the Indian category. The variety of the buffet was ok. About 4 vege items, 3 non-veg, good saffron rice, with all the usual sides, naan was cold and hard, and gulab jamun were horrible. Overall food taste was really good. So in weighing all the pros and cons, I'd give this place 3.5 stars."}
