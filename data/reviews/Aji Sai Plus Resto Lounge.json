{"text":"I was back at Aji Sai Plus Resto Lounge to try their AYCE. Although I still stand by what I previously wrote about their oyster and regular menu, I felt compelled to write another review about their AYCE exclusively.  For $12.99 (weekend lunch), not only was I impressed with their selection, but also impressed by their presentation and food taste. Compared to other AYCE in Toronto, including other Aji Sai locations, the food is definitely superior here: no sloppy business here. Among all the great things here, their fire kamakachi with banana as well as their long list of dessert menu really stood out. 

The service was extremely slow, and a lot of items we wanted had to be ordered multiple times since they kept being forgotten. The staff weren't very familiar with the food items on the menu and what was being served. We ended up ordering stuff we didn't want, and were served false items. All of this led to a very long lunch session... and because of this, we weren't able to order all the dessert we wanted - it was past their last call, and also by then, a lot of them weren't available."}
{"text":"I live pretty close to this place and have been here with my girlfriend a few times - the prices aren't bad (for lunch) but the service is ABYSMAL. Every server I have ever had here has been rude, cold, and stuck up. They often forget things you've ordered (even though its an electronic ordering system with a tracker, so you know what you have yet to receive) and if you say anything they tell you \"you got that already\". In any case, its AYCE, so maybe bring me another one? I don't like being lied to right to my face, but the food isn't terrible for the cheap lunch price, so if you just want to get full, hit it up. Otherwise, if you're looking for quality sushi with good service? Find somewhere else to go!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place and had to make a special trip downtown while i was visiting Toronto.  
No regrets, as I left as a satisfied customer with a happy tummy.  

Tako Wasabi and Deep Fried Brie are a must.  There's so much to choose from, but only so much stomach space.  

I'll be coming back when i come visit Toronto again."}
{"text":"Never coming back to this place, AYCE limited for 2 hours, but they took almost 50min to deliver 5 rolls and 2 hand rolls. 
The selection of food was very limited compared to other aji sai restaurants, and the quality of the food was not impressive at all"}
{"text":"The noodles and seafood soup taste like shit. Bad customer service. Never come back again."}
{"text":"the first time I have ever had to chew salmon sushi...the chef forgot to remove the silver skin. the butterfish was icy in the middle and the dim sum was cold...very disappointing"}
{"text":"Place smelled like stagnant rotten wet fish towels on entry..boom..lost 90 percent of my appetite from that alone. 
Rolls were lopsided and not well done at all.
Food was below average didn't taste fresh.
Ordered 2 items 4 times on all u can eat menu it never arrived waitress said nothing. Didn't refill our water at all and place was near empty.
Awful experience.
Clean the restaurant or at least spray some scents in the air..common now"}
{"text":"Worst place ever for AYCE! The service is fast but not friendly at all. The food is not fresh, cold and not tasty. In addition, this place is said to be a lounge but it is definitely NOT the kind of place where you want to have a drink. Stay away from it!"}
{"text":"I will never return to this location. Went for all you can eat during lunch.

- floors were sticky
- employee shopping bags on the counters
- yam tempura completely under cooked and not properly strained of the cooking oil
- Calamari was under cooked as well
- Siu Mai was suppose to be pork. It tasted exactly like tinned corned beef
- plain chicken wings are seasoned with curry???
- green salad was drenched in sauce
- Teriyaki chicken was slightly undercooked and used hoisen sauce?
- Kimchi tasted so watered down and sprinkled with chili powder
- bowl of plain rice was too al dente

I almost never write reviews. These are the issues I had with my meal."}
{"text":"I always go to the Aji Sai on Queen west but was in the area and tried out the Aji Sai on Yonge.

I have to say the sushi is better here! Rolls were well made and there were lots of special rolls to try out. Serving was nice and small.  Service was good, restaurant was clean.

Only reason why it is 4 stars is that it is kind of expensive!"}
{"text":"Went here for the oysters.

Don't!

After being served a bitter champagne cocktail, I proceeded to receive some of the worst oysters I have ever had. The 24 oysters were slimy with the smelly odour almost putrid and very certainly nauseated. I tried one but gagging I sent them all back. Disgusting. 
But it gets worse, though I really didn't want to pay for food I didn't eat, the waitress somewhat insisted that I did. She had a very strong accent so it was hard to understand her I think she said something about the oyster being too large which was the problem...?
Then something about them being shucked 'today' so my option was invalid.
Proceeded to bring me another oyster which I was forced to eat...? Like I had to prove to her I didn't want the meal.
She seemed to b trying to Jedi mind-trick into eating this gross food. 
And then she gave me lovely suggestion that I should go home and cook the oysters myself............. ?!?

Wow . I ended up paying just so I could gtfo and eat sometimes hygienic .


What the fuck..."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was.... confusing. Filled out our AYCE order on a paper with menu options listed and they kept asking us what we hadn't received yet (huh? ). Shrimp tempura was particularly greasy. Beef fried rice was also overdone with a *suggestion* of meat.  Prefer the California roll to how it's done the right way at Sushi on Queen. For the crowd on Yonge st who are ready to sit and eat anything after a long day of combat shopping."}
{"text":"Sushi tasted decent. Steak and chicken dishes tasted stale. 5 people from my group got sick after. Must have been rotten food. Do NOT try the buffet."}
{"text":"Out of many sushi AYCE that I have visited I find that Aji Sai Plus Resto lounge comes in my top 3 choices. They put minimal amount of rice unlike some places that try to fill you up with white rice. The rolls are unique and the sushi are really nicely made. They 're not that big so if leave you lots of room to try many different kinds of sushi and rolls there. 

Another thing I like if their kitchen menu (try the veal chop) and how they have shrimp tempura during lunch. For the price of $11.00 they have many choices and most importantly, their choice are all worth trying (except some soups)."}
{"text":"Walking downtown with my girlfriend and spotted this restaurant. Looks good from outside so we decided to give it a try. A girl at the door walked us to our seat. No Menu no nothing was handed to us.  \"ITS NOT THAT BUSY at the time\"  One girl is at the back of the restaurant chatting with a group of guys eating *must be her friends by the way their talking. 

And the other girl is just standing by the cash area. Almost 10 minutes after.. No Service so we decided to walk out. By that time the girl chatting at the back noticed that were leaving.  She said Im sorry and kinda asked us to stay. I said nope.. were done and were outtah here.

Very disapponted with the service. I can see that I am not the only one who had this issue.. New Restaurant already bad feedbacks.. Not recommended!"}
{"text":"Service: 4 stars
Food: 2 stars
Overall experience: 2 stars

I went to Aji Sai Plus for the first time with a friend on Friday evening. Since they had half price special on all appetizers, we ordered sushi pizza and takoyaki first, and also ordered grilled mussels, rice paper roll, and yonge st roll.

The food was just okay. Takoyaki was just blend fried bites with tiny piece of octopus (or squid?) and sushi pizza was actually quite tinier than other places. Grilled mussels were salty and had cheese and mayo on top. They could definitely use some less salt on that dish. (And they came with huge bed of sea salt underneath it--I'm assuming for the \"decor\".) When we asked the server how many pieces were in the rice paper roll and she said there are 4, but slightly larger. That was a lie. If anyone had a \"fresh shrimp roll (wrapped in a rice paper)\" at a Chinese restaurant, you would know what I am talking about. It was exactly that, except it had salmon and avocado inside. TOO small for the price (around $6). Yonge St roll was okay. But like another reviewer said, it's hard to screw up any deep-fried dish anyway.

The server was nice, and the food came out in pretty good timing. The decor was nice, although the music was TOO loud for me.

Overall, I am not sure if I would go back. The presentation of the food is REALLY nice, and perhaps it's a good \"drinking\" place (and while drinking you can't even tell if the sushi is fresh or not anyway). But for the price of food (at least $2-3 more expensive than other places), the portion was tiny, which I wouldn't have minded at all if the quality was good, and the quality wasn't even all great. I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from this restaurant, spent 10 minutes telling the person our address and they couldn't find it, hilarious because we ordered before and got it delivered to the exact place. People who don't speak English properly should not pick up the phone, I for one am Asian, and this is absurd. Horrible service."}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite all-you-can-eat spots for lunch, not because it is particularly good, but because it is close by and they have a decent selection. The service isn't great, as you can probably see from a lot of people's comments, but I really am not there for the service, and what I ask for usually comes, so that's not a big problem for me. 

The sushi rolls are quite good, although I've noticed that the portion sizes have changed. They are a bit smaller now, which is good in my opinion, since you can sample many different kinds of rolls. I'm not a big fan of their dinner all-you-can-eat though. The quality of the fish is not that great, which tastes fine in sushi rolls, but if you are there for sashimi, i would go elsewhere (I highly recommend Fushimi on church). Overall, i think it's a fine AYCE place for lunch if you are there to eat lots of rolls and don't care about servers coming to check on you constantly, but the extra $10 or so for dinner isn't really worth it."}
{"text":"Quality of food is below average. It's your typical discount sushi joint but with 'nice seating', laminate flooring, loud music, and some fruit flies. And because it's on Yonge Street, it is reflected in their high prices (in comparison to the quality of their food). The experience was alright. Our server had unnaturally blue contact lenses and I found myself lost in them to the point of forgetting what he asked me. The experience just wasn't remarkable."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday, and well the sushi was fresh and yummy. So why two stars? Well read this as 1.5 stars and I will tell you why:

1: My friend and I waited 10 minutes just to be seated when the place was only half full (around 15 people). Then we had to waive down our server in order to be served after waiting another 12 minutes of her ignoring us. 

2: My friend noticed they have a bar rail special on Mondays, so we asked to get one. The waitress replied that she could not give us the Monday bar rail special because the bartender was not working that day. However the waitress told us we can order other alcoholic beverages, just not the special. How does that make any sense?!?!! If there is no bartender working how can we order other alcoholic beverages? They just wanted to make more $ by not giving out the advertised special!!

3: The only other time the servers came around to our table was when it was time to pay. No water refills, no empty plates taken away.

4: They only allow a 2 hour table time limit for all you can eat (why do they call it all you can eat when they kick you out after 2 hours)?!?!?"}
{"text":"Good was lower than average and not as fresh as I hoped. This new location is not as good as the other aji sai location, maybe because this is one focuses more on drinks than food. I decided to give this one a try because it's closer to me. But I have to say that I'm really disappointed with the food and service.

Food
The sushis are not as fresh as other sushi places. The avocados were all overripe and already brown. I asked them to change it but as I assumed they probably all overripe. So I tried to avoid everything without avocado. It's a big minus as avocado is in almost every other dish or sushi, and I love avocado. The dimsum are obviously not as good as the dimsum restaurants but even Springrolls has much better dimsums. I tried the siumai and hargaw/ shrimp wonton, which tasted different from what I know and not as fresh. The sushis have way too much rice compared to the other ingredients.

Service
The service was ok, but the but very experienced. I assume they are trainees and seem very overwhelmed. We had to ask different waitresses to get our orders and requests because they kept forgetting. We were waiting for 1,5 hours just to get 2 or 3 dishes and then nothing came anymore. After asking a few times, the waitress confirmed that they might have lost or forgot to punch in the rest of our order. So we had to order again. This time it came out fairly fast. The waitress apologized a few times and we weren't too mad, because she is new and she tried her best to fix it. Some were really friendly while others were stressed. Overall, the service was ok. 

This location is very limited in space, and not recommended for big groups.

I would not come here again, just because the food was below average and waiting time is very long. The other aji sai locations are a bit better than this one. But I wouldn't mind giving the bar a try."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service could use some polishing. On my second visit, I was left standing by the doorway or entrance for a good 5-10min without anyone approaching me. The place wasn't busy at the time so I was quite irritated that no one came up to me to ask whether I had reservations or if I was dining in. I literally had to walk up to one of the servers after waiting for some time to get a table for my friends and I, and only then was I taken care of. The staff needs to be more attentive, especially when customers want to come in."}
{"text":"Great first time. My husband and I were looking for somewhere now for dinner tonight and liked the regular menu, if we had known it was a all you can eat we would have brought more people with us."}
{"text":"Had their shrimp tempura takeout once.  There were only two shrimps, for one meal.  I was left hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"I never expect much at Ayce but this was awful. I've been here once and I don't know why I came back the second time. I asked the waitress if it'd be possible to make a hand roll without rice... she looked confused which was fine so I showed her a photo. Immediately another girl came out wearing sushi gloves so I assume she was the cook. And very defensively said \"no we cannot make that without rice\". I know they don't premake their rolls so why wouldn't she be able to just hold the rice! I'm saving u ingredients! Needless to say I walked out. So much attitude from all the staff."}
{"text":"The price is cheap. However, the sushi and maki were below standard quality for AYCE. The service was terrible, the rolls were all falling part and overly packed with their dry and hard sushi rice. In addition, the avocado had a weird taste to it and the kitchen food was terrible enough that the sauces could not mask the bad taste even a bit. This is the second Aji Sai location in the GTA I have tried. It is worse than the one by Bayview/John and I will not be at any Aji Sai again."}
{"text":"NO MORE Aburi sushi on the  AYCE menu and the price is now $14.99 for lunch! They haven't added anything new but have taken away some items like the aburi sushi. How can anyone justify a price increase when product level has decreased. It's like the TTC raising its fare and not increasing service levels. And the quality of the food hasn't changed, it's still borderline average. The price hike is probably to pay for all the tablets each table orders from. Sayonara Aji Sai."}
{"text":"Came here after work with a few co-workers on a Tuesday night.  Was pretty dead when we got to Aji Sai.  The place itself looks clean and modern.  Space wise it was pretty big with enough tables to not feel cramp.  Food itself was decent but it is mostly an ayce place but we decided to do a la carte since not everyone was hungry. Pricing a little higher than the typical sushi joints in the area but the quality of the raw fish was pretty good.  The wait staff was attentive and came to check on us throughout the night.  The mixed out orders up and they didn't know which order belong to who so that was a big mess.  Besides that it is a decent place to grab some sushi and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. The quality of food is so bad and sushi tastes at least a day old. I ordered butterfish sushi and it was HARD and chewy!! I had to spit it out over fear of getting sick. So disgusting! All the other sushi tasted like the ingredients were old. For the price they charge you are better off going somewhere else. Will not return!"}
{"text":"The reviews are deceiving,  this place is great and the food is top notch for an AYCE restaurant.   The sushi is on par with most places in Toronto and the sashimi is fresh and tasty.  The food comes out quick and the service is pretty quick as long as you are a familiar face and tip well. 

My first few experiences here were good and I have eatten the $1 oyster specials before.  They are larger than your typical oyster restaurants and they still taste very rich and smooth.   The sushi itself is well made and it is made fresh and to order. 

The dessert is my favorite thing about this place.  The fried bananas and green tea iced cream keeps me going even after a huge sushi meal!  I will definitely be coming back here in the future again with my healthy appetite!"}
{"text":"Good: 15% off yelp offer works! 
Bad: everything else.

Save your money and just don't. Even if you just want a quick fix for ayce, the price still makes me feel overcharged. I understand you get what you paid for, but I rather pay extra couples of bucks to get some MUCH BETTER quality ayce somewhere else."}
{"text":"Nope Nope Nope.

I've come here a couple of times and it has been half-decent, but no longer...

Came here with the girlfriend for an early dinner after a short trip away. 
We had a wide variety of things on the menu. Some of the lowlights:

-Tiny bowls of seaweed salad (they used to be double the size)
-Weird super spicy rolls with way too much mayo
-limited selection of rolls. Their menu seems to have shrunk since introducing ipads
-Putting sashimi on the same plate as a hot dish and it started to partially cook
-goopy goopy rice
-Wasabi in the Green Tea Ice cream!!!!

and to top it off I tried to use my 15% off Yelp discount check in coupon. First they said I could only use it if I had cash... So i went and got cash. Then they said they could only ring in it with the manager and the manager wasn't there yet.. and we would have to wait 30 mins to an hour for them to come in...

We left. 

Never coming back. Do yourself a favour and don't come here either."}
{"text":"I've been here before with a girlfriend of mine and my little brother. We had some great times here. Their sangria here is amazing. The food here is also good. Not Great, but good. I like the decor of the place . It's cute and friendly. The staff were not very great at all. Kind of forgot about us at numerous times."}
{"text":"My husband and I were quite excited to try a new sushi place so close to us.  Unfortunately we were very disappointed. When ordering we asked for a recommendation, and the waitress told us she didn't really eat sushi, but the yonge street roll was really popular.  I mean, what sushi waitress in their right mind would tell there customers that  she doesn't eat sushi?!?!? ANYWAY, we took her recommendation and ordered the yonge street roll as well as oysters, some sushi pieces and sashimi. 

Of course, even though we said we would \"start\" with the oysters, almost everything else came out before them.  The sashimi and sushi pieces were NOT fresh.  When the oysters finally came out they tasted really old too.  Our roll came out after, and the waitress tired to balance it between two plates which ended up squishing our last scallop sashimi.... smart.  The roll wasn't that bad except for the \"cheese\" sauce that was all over it.  It tasted like melted cheese wiz.  It was really off-putting.  The actual roll wasn't too bad.. but then again its difficult to screw up a deep fried roll.

Overpriced old fish, cheese wiz & bad service.. no thanks."}
{"text":"Waitresses are friendly, the environment is relaxing, clean, and the service is quick. As for the price, you get what you've paid for. To be honest, I've been to better AYCE sushi that has fresh fish, but hey, it was only $21 for a dinner plus it was on a weekend :)"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi is not new to me, I've been to 2 other Aji Sai chain restaurants and both were better experiences.

The food: Nothing special, below average sushi but what you would expect from the average all you can eat sushi.

Service: The service was not bad but not incredible. They never checked up on us but were there when we wanted them. The only thing I really didn't enjoy that really ruined my experience was they charged us for the small amount we had left over. (Otherwise a 3 star)

Both other Aji Sai restaurants I've been to won't bother to charge you for remaining food if it's not a significant amount. We had 2 hand rolls left over and we were charged $3. If you ask me, that's just ridiculous.

Price: fair around $17 for lunch after everything and $25 for dinner

I would not recommend this place. Not worth your money and you can find better sushi"}
{"text":"Came here with friends for a get together for lunch ($11.99 Monday-Wednesday). The food was good but the servers were horrible. It gets pretty busy at lunch but there is only three servers! The service was slow, there was constant mistakes with our orders, and the waitress showed us disrespect by sighing every time we asked for our order and expected us to tip a higher amount after such poor service. We had to wait almost an hour for our order. I felt bad observing the people that waited at least 10 minutes to get seated because the two servers were always busy. 

On a positive note the food was decent and it was good that there was more selections than the usually AYCE lunch. 

I hope they hire more servers during busier hours (lunch & dinner)"}
{"text":"I went here twice since it is really closed to where i work.

-food is good  for even though  i am not a big fan of sushi. 
-Kimchi fries and Japadog were really good and speical.

Price:
--its like average price (similar to all other sushi restaurants)"}
{"text":"The sushi here was pretty good just not a huge selection on the all you can eat menu anyways. The ipad does make it easy to order though and it comes relatively quickly. The environment was fun and playing house music. Haven't been back since though with the lack of selection"}
{"text":"3.5*
After my first review- where I discussed my horrible experience with the terrible server- Yang, the manager, sent me a private message and asked me to come in for a free dinner for two and give them another try.  
Let me say that I am SO very pleased when managers and resto owners are really generous and provide Yelpers with this opportunity.

I came and gave it another try and I was, again, fine with the food - but this time the service was much much better.  As stated before- there was one particular server the last time I went who was just terrible.  The other servers were great.  This time that particular server was not there (Yang said he let her go-- even though I didn't specify which one it was... ) and the new server was incredible and very accommodating.

Amongst the two of us we had 4 drinks, oysters, some appetizers, sashimi, a roll and some other dishes that the chef's brought out for us to try.
The food is good and not your typical sushi restaurant but not an izakaya either.

I have a tough time letting you know what \"type\" of place this is- they are going for a lounge experience but it is not your busy/noise izakaya.
The best way I can describe this is like your Japanese Milestone's or Earls.  If you wanted to have good Japanese food, (but not your 10$ sushi joint), and not particularly your high end/overpriced Ki, and you had a large group to accommodate- I would bring them here.

The one thing I am fairly impressed with is their alcoholic beverage menu- They have quite the range of drinks- even though they didn't have the wine I wanted at that time- they had a good range that would suit anybody's tastes for a solid night out or your stop before wherever you end up.

For a large group and a better than average environment for Japanese food I'd take my group here for sure.  I just can't think of too many circumstances when I'd choose to come here.  I'm excited to see what will come for this place- I ran into another yelper there that was chatting with the owners about a sustainable menu.  I think if this place chose to go there they could differentiate themselves greatly and put themselves on the map.  As of now- it's a bit of an awkward business model on a weird part of Yonge street.  There are a lot of sushi places on Yonge- This place could fill a niche... or people might just opt for the cheaper stuff on Yonge."}
{"text":"Had an incredible time here with a friend of mine. We came in on a Monday night for their $1 oysters and \"Appy Hour\" (1/2 priced appetizers from 5-7pm). I don't know how the servers were able to say \"Appy Hour\" out loud without rolling their eyes or sounding hateful. Also, $10 pitcher of mojitos. Super fresh and tasty. 

We ordered the Japadog with spicy salmon, which was basically a good street meat dog with spicy salmon, and.. pickled cucumber? I don't know what was in it, just that it was super delicious. My friend and I absolutely fell in love with the Kimchi Beef Fries. It was kind of like poutine, but more savoury and just fantastic. The chicken skewers were good, but really, we were overshadowed by the kimchi fries. We also ordered a sushi appetizer which was 5 pieces of sushi. Decent quality fish and rice, but nothing to call home about. 

The oyster special only includes the Malpeque and Fanny Bay oysters, which were VERY fresh and tasty. They come with Worcestershire sauce, seafood sauce, hot sauce, lemons and horseradish. At $1 apiece, they're totally worth it, especially the Fanny Bay oysters, which were big and fat, and just super flavourful with a briny taste to them. Love.

The servers were super friendly and quick with food and drinks. It was super dead in there, though, possibly because of the insane rain we were having that day.

The total damage came to about $50 with a good tip. Considering the quality of the food and drinks we had, and the fact that we nearly had to roll ourselves out, I'd say that's a good deal for two people. The Monday night specials are a FANTASTIC deal if you want to share a bunch of different stuff with a friend."}
{"text":"Decent AYCE, it's nothing spectacular but it's the price you pay for. Drinks are not included in the AYCE price. 

The servings were small and the plates were still wet from being washed. Not much of a selection, and the service was just average."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a preliminary 4 stars.  They are new and I feel they are still getting things together and I have noticed changes in prices and the menu recently. 

The sushi, price, and location are decent.   The wait staff is friendly, but sometimes not as responsive as I'd like.  I feel the sushi is good but could be better as well.  Not quite up to the standard of the Queen St. location.  I feel like right now they deserve 3.5 stars, but since they are still getting into their groove I'll round it up to 4."}
{"text":"The service is okay here. But my issue is really the food itself. Was here for AYCE. The rolls were all lopsided and uneven with a ridiculous amount of rice. It wasn't even an even coating of rice. They include a 13% tip in their bill. The door kept being opened wide, letting in cold air, and as we had been seated right in front of the door, we kept getting blasted by frigid winds. I think I've been mostly unimpressed with the sushi houses in this neighbourhood. There are many, but nothing is worthy of $20/per for lunch (with the tax and tip), IMO.

I will say this, the first time I visited this place, they had just opened and did not have AYCE for dinner at the time (a couple years ago). The service was good and the a la carte food was delicious. So something's changed in that time, and not for the better."}
{"text":"I only got half of what I ordered. I really wouldn't bother with this place the portions from the picture and dish are really misleading and not that tasty"}
{"text":"I ordered food online on Christmas Eve and trying to have a relax night with friends. It said on the confirmation email that the order would be delivered in an hour, so we were just waiting in patience since it was Christmas Eve. Until an hour and half, we were still waiting and we tried to call the restaurant numerous times with no one answering the phone. We left few voice messages and we were angry with hunger. 
This restaurant is ridiculous! Will never ever go to this restaurant or order online from it. Even if it's Christmas Eve, it doesn't give them any excuse to mistreat their customers. I got no call back from them nor know if they even got the order at the first place.
We ordered thru JustEat.com, after that, we did a complaint and got our refund back.
Honestly, I've never tried the food so I can't judge the quality of the food. However, some of my friends have dined-in before and they don't recommend it. I ordered because it was almost the only Japanese restaurant open for delivery at that time and we were craving for it."}
{"text":"All 3 cups of Jasmine tea were served cold -  The Sashimi portions are ever so small. Thin little piece  of salmon in each order. Ordered 5 and if you put them together as one it would be about the size of a regular portion anywhere else. The fish was for the most part fresh. The tempura was ok-ay I guess. 

The cold tofu was disgusting - don't know if tofu can spoil, but waiting 30 min for what was incredibly disappointing -  tofu out of the package, cut in Squares and the put soy sauce on it - it was slimy, ice cold and gross! 

The wasabi was not good and the ginger was very fake tasting. 

I know I sound harsh - but as I write this I realize it was not very good here. I  will say the service was great and the 4th cup of tea was finally hot......just as I was leaving .......they poured hot tea....great !"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favourite AYCE sushi places, and I am completely shocked by the reviews on here! I decided to try it out on a whim some time last year, even though I had a bad experience at the Queen St location and have no regrets! It has become my go-to, and I'm there at least once every two weeks.

A lot of people have complained that the entrees come out very slowly, but I don't experience this as I usually put in a large order and everything comes out gradually. I don't see why it's such a big issue. 

The service is mediocre, as in they're very nice, but there's not much servicing to do really. They just bring out the food, take away empty plates, and pour more water. I don't have any complaints, since I don't expect anything more than what they're already doing. I wonder what everyone else complaining expects of them? 

Although the spicy salmon maki (one of my essentials) isn't made the way I prefer, I am obsessed with the Philadelphia hand roll and the salmon roses. The portions are great, since they don't go crazy and stuff it with rice like some other sushi places.

As well, they have a very wide variety of items on their menu, that again other sushi places don't offer. Although they're not really considered Japanese food, I thoroughly enjoy the options of dim sum, yam fries, sesame balls, and kim chi fries. It's a nice variety.


Lastly, I would like to mention that the restaurant is clean and I am very pleased that they serve their glasses of water with a straw! I think this is definitely a personal preference, since it's a pet peeve of mine when I am served water without a straw. (First world problems lol)

Anyways, I love this place for it's lunch price and variety."}
{"text":"Ordered a boat and they gave us regular sushi combo and said, \"Yes, I know it's just not on a boat.\" Then why the fuck would we ordered a boat???"}
{"text":"Service is flat-out bad.. even when tablets take off much of the responsibility.  Food was mediocre.. mostly a temperature issue (rolls were too warm, whereas dishes that should have been hot were lukewarm)."}
{"text":"Read my previous review first.  I really enjoyed the food quality the first time and this time as well.  The service wasn't great the first time but my coworker told me to give it another chance.

This time,however the speed of food coming out is absolutely unacceptable for an ayce restaurant.  It's almost like they purposely serve you slow or are understaffed in the kitchen so that you eat less.  It took a full hour for all our sushi, rolls and kitchen food to come out even though there were only 2-3 tables.  It was very awkward as some people don't want rolls, some don't want sushi and some don't want hot food.  It made for a very uncomfortable lunch.  Also, servers are so frowny.

Verdict: not for work lunch and need to be patient.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"I was taking some time off of wheat and dairy and didn't have time to pack a lunch so I figured I should get some sashimi. I got the combo that's like $11 for 12 pieces. It looked good. Nice variety, large slices. I wasn't very satisfied with it when I ate it though. The fish seemed bland and water-logged if that makes sense. I'm not a sashimi expert, I've eaten enough to know the fish was strange but not enough to say what was wrong with it. The staff seemed a little disorganized too. It took one to take my take out order, one to ring it in, and another to take my money and make change."}
{"text":"Not good at all. We love love sushi and know the best places in town. Didn't know this was here so decided to check it out. TERRIBLE QUALITY!! Was really disgusted and I was nervous about food poisoning; something tasted off. I'd advise against, truthfully. Nothing is great except the salad. Aji said further north on Yonge is 10x better. 
Terrible music to boot. 
Only thing they do have is alcohol. Can't mess that up. Too bad it's not all you can drink!"}
{"text":"First time visiting here on new years day. I ordered the salmon teriyaki bento box. The salmon piece was tiny and there was no teriyaki sauce. The california rolls were a nice size and the gyoza was great. The service was friendly and the washrooms were clean."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the service was very very slow.   We were going to a show on the area and figured 90 minutes for buffet was enough time to eat.  NOT!  It took a long time for the food to arrive.  In fact, we were quite disappointed that we had to cancel a lot of our order since we had to catch our show.  The low review is not a reflection of the food quality but rather the long wait (kitchen speed).  Definitively not the go place when in a rush!  We actually left hungry which is disappointing."}
{"text":"1.5 stars.

I was hoping for more out of the sushi bento box but to my disappointment, the food that was in my bento box didn't contain a lot of sushi and didn't look too appetizing. It's literally as though someone took the sushi, deep fried dumplings and tofu out of a sushi to-go pack and arranged them in a bento tray. There was definitely room for more sashimi and California rolls. The bento didn't taste very fresh either. That meal was definitely not worth $10. I'm also shocked that it's $22 for AYCE dinners. The other Aji Sai location (the one on Queen) is so much better. I would say that one of the few redeeming factors about the Aji Sai on Yonge would be how clean it is. Apart from that, I probably won't be coming back here any time soon."}
{"text":"They dont take the 15% off coupon that was on yelp as per the waitress. Calling bs on that. Service was horrible. I ended up putting up one order of green tea because they kept skipping my order...everytime. Food was meh at best and i only liked the edamame.

Not worth going for lunch."}
{"text":"They are still working out the kinks since opening but this place is a much welcome addition to the neighborhood! This is an upscale version of a sushi restaurant with no all you can eat, just a la carte. 

Their mixed drinks and cocktails were delicious (try the Sapporo mojito) and they have daily food specials like oysters on Wednesday. 

The sashimi was fresh and delicious and their rolls were really tasty. My only gripes are there are no handrolls on the menu (even though they are posted on the window) and there are no sushi / sashimi combinations together. Why not? There are only sashimi combos and none come with rice. :-(

I've been here twice since opening and I had a good time each time. I'll be back for sure for oyster night!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  Has well price lunch time AYCE.  Came here with a friend and brought baby.  They have high chairs, so that was a win.  The service was a wee bit slow, but we did come during lunch hour, so that's to be expected.  The seaweed salad portions were super small.  And they actually kept bringing the stuff we ordered to the table next to us, so that was a bit weird.  Overall, its wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Aji Sai is a large \"resto lounge\" offering menu and all you can eat sushi.  The bathrooms are not accessible and most of the menu is not vegan with a little bit of vegetarian sprinkled in.  Their lunch all you can eat is $12, which is very competitive for the area.

I came by towards the end of the lunch service, which I wasn't hungry enough to order.  Their were many people finishing up who looked like they were enjoying themselves.  The food was coming out quickly and regularly.  

I was seated immediately and ordered some tea and edamame.  I ended up having a couple of bowls of soup before filing up.  All of my food was delicious and warm.  It came out quickly.  I was also provided with the wifi password.  

I'm not a huge fan of AYCE ordering, but I like AYCE places 'cause you can often order a bunch of stuff off the menu at reasonable prices.  Aji Sai was no exception.  I plan on returning."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. What i even got..since I waited over an hour and I got half of my order. The sushi was hot. The kitchen food was cold and bland. I asked numerous times for wasabi and water. It even took 20 min to get the IPad to order my food. I got there at 2pm and finally left at 3;30 after only receiving half my nasty food. What a waste of time, money and calories. Never again!!"}
{"text":"The food is far below subpar (like a budget Spring Sushi), but staff are pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Not too bad for an AYCE place. Orders came out quite fast and it was satisfying. Bonus for checking in on yelp: 15% off on cash payments for the AYCE. The waiter made a bit of a fuss for it, but I insisted and they were happy to oblige. Good place with variety of rolls and sashimi."}
{"text":"I love oysters BUT  I don't love them here. Ordered a dozen and ate a few, left, came home and kept the receipt so I would know what my source of food poisoning was. The oysters were really horrific. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the sushi here. I always come for the AYCE lunch. They have a lot of variety in their rolls, lots of dessert options, and some interesting appetizers that are not always included such as takoyaki. I really like their mackerel as it is not too oily, unlike other restaurants. They also just introduced an ipad ordering system but I find it confusing. 

Currently, my husband and I are on a break from this restaurant because last time we came we never got a lot of the stuff we ordered (despite ordering it several times) and it took 2 hours for lunch because the food took so long to come out. It was a holiday Monday and they must have been understaffed or something as we can usually eat in about 45 minutes. However, the food they did bring out was still good and we will forgive them and try again in a few months just because their food is always good."}
{"text":"Though service was relatively good, there was a giant black cockroach in the dimly-lit washroom. So I don't imagine the kitchen being much better. 

Lost my appetite. I don't want roaches in my sushi, thanks."}
{"text":"I came here alone and got all you can eat sushi.

They serve you all the non filling, small items quickly and take more than 30 minutes serving you the rolls and sushi.

Spent more than 1 hour and was only served 1 of the 3 rolls I ordered.

They want you to feel full by serving all the small items and making you wait 30+ minutes for the main.

Also, my 2 orders of dim sums were late, so when I asked one of the servers, she came back within 1 minute with 4 orders of cold dim sums that probably was sitting there for a long time.

They seem to not know what you have ordered, what have been already served and what yet need to be served.

Won't be coming here again.

Ended up leaving with 4 orders not served at all, 2 of which were rolls I waited for 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Great AYCE sushi lunch!"}
{"text":"This place used to be my go to for AYCE because it was cheap and to my liking. The last few times I've been have left me questioning why I like this place, unfortunately.

I felt like it started out good, but there are times where I go and items don't show up until I'm paying the bill. Like I'm done and have accepted that it isn't coming then all of a sudden surprise! Here's those rolls you ordered while I hand you the credit machine.

Last time I was there, and it will be my last time ever, I was given room temperature water in a dirty cup. They use plastic cups because they are easy to wash and they get dinged up in the dish washer, I get that. But there was something grey and lodged to the side of my cup and I was immediately grossed out. My salad felt like it was washed in the same cup as it was served in, and it tasted like soap. Also when you order ice cream, it's scooped out prior (probably in the mornings), which is fine but sometimes you get one that's been refrozen after melting a bit. I noticed the couple beside me didn't have an iPad for AYCE and although I don't know if they hadn't decided yet on that or regular menu, they seemed a little annoyed that I got my iPad to order before them.

I was also waiting an unusual time to be seated and was only helped once another customer showed up and the waitress assumed we were together.

The FIRST time I ever went, was maybe 15 min after open and I was told to come back later (half hour later). I thought maybe I accidentally snuck in too early, but upon leaving I checked their hours and they were definitely suppose to be open.

I don't really know what to tell you. Food is super hit or miss, service is slow because they are clearly understaffed and numerous times I've had dirty cutlery."}
{"text":"I usually never write reviews about restaurants, but in this case, I felt an obligation to do so, just so that no one else goes through the same experience.

I'm only putting a star because Yelp doesn't offer the option to put 'minus' stars.

I went there for the second time since their opening, on Wednesday for the all you can eat lunch.
My friend and I were the first customers in, at 11:30am. As we sat down, after about 15min, the waitress informed us that the food would take about another 20-30min to be ready. We didn't think much of it, as  we thought perhaps since they just opened, they were still prepping. 
However, 45min after their opening time, I noticed the two sushi chefs just walked in the restaurant and started cleaning their workspace! What kind of restaurant has their chef arriving after their customers?! That really threw me off.

Now down to the food. By 12:40 (a whole hour after we ordered), we received a few samples of the food we had picked, namely two soups (which tasted like boiled water, literally). We even had to send those back.

By 1:10pm, we asked one of the waiter what was happening with our food as we were still waiting for another 2/3 of what we had ordered. By that point, we had received only 2 watered down soups, a seaweed salad, a stale and soggy tempura roll (clearly the tempura was from the day before), some fries, and 4 sushi. 

The waiter seemed surprised we were impatient, as he told us we only had 2 more items coming (we had about 5 more items to come!).

When we asked to see the manager, we were told that there was no manager.
So we finally decided to take our things and leave. 
It just wasn't worth the wait.

Clearly the chefs were rushing (after coming late to work) and so all our food looked nothing like our first experience there. Presentation was sloppy and the rolls were hollow and falling apart.

I would never go back and do not recommend this place to anyone.
My first experience was good, but to have such a drastic inconsistency is unacceptable.
On a side note, staff were like robots and did not seem to know what customer service is."}
{"text":"Average quality meal for sushi on Yonge Street.  Service was speedy.  Worthy of a return visit though I would prefer if sashimi was an option.  The miso soup was perfect to start with on such a cold winter day."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what a 3 star should be. It's entirely moderate and not disappointing while taking up zero memorable points in my brain. 

I love that this place is next to my gym and workplace. It's great for after a workout during bulking season. It's great for having a meeting. 

But again, really uninspired dining. You get exactly what you think you would. Even the service is perfectly moderate. Not great. Not a reason to complain. I wish I got more wasabi, but they get my water enough. Things just balance out. 

The menu is limited but also has some surprising things on it. The overage fee for ordering too much isn't that bad either. If you're in the mood for nothing special this is the place for you!

Note I lowered my rating because I think the service has gone down a bit."}
{"text":"I really don't want to say it is the worst restaurant I have ever been. And I hate to give a bad comment. But i really don't want anybody else waste their time and money to be disappointed. I saw Aji Sai on yelp and found their AYCE lunch menu had a lot choices with a good price. I am a sushi lover so i decided to go there have a try with my friend. I have been to almost all the sushi restaurants in downtown. Unfortunately, this was my worst experience.

Firstly, the food is bad enough. I had AYCE lunch with my friend, the fish were not fresh and the rice was very hard. The fried tofu and tempuras were extremely skewed that you could not even recognize. The seaweed salad and kimchi beef fries are ok.

Secondly, the \"funny\" service. The food from kitchen  we ordered on the first order were totally lost! I told the waitress twice. You know what, after the first time I told the waitress, the waitress took a  dish of tofu which was taken from another table(maybe due to the wrong dish) and asked us \"do you want to try this?!?!?!?\" wtf! It was the dish that was rejected from other table and the waitress wanted to give it to us.

The missed food were still not provided to us untill I told the waitress again. And when the food were delivered to us, another waitress came to us and warn us, if you cannot eat all of them, u r gonna pay 50 cent for each piece. I was so \"surprised\".
Firstly, this was the first time that I got a warning! And we didn't even have enough food. The food were missed and when they were given to us at one time, we got a warning when we even not finished! 

Well, the other table next to us was also complaining about the missed food and the two women left with unhappy face. 

I had a AYCE lunch but I didn't even want to eat more even though I could. Because the sushi rice was too hard and the rolls were made too bad except the spicy salmon.

Anyways, i will never ever go there and it is indeed the worst restaurant experience. It was horrible. 

\"horrible\" is the only word that I could think of.
Btw, wild ginger is even better than Aji Sai but it is not good. Takumi is not bad and Fushimi is good. 

Good luck my friends, I wrote all these because I don't want you to have a horrible experience like me."}
{"text":"Aji Sai restaurant is one of my all time favourites! Best AYCE restaurant in Toronto with great food and reasonable prices. 
The Queen St. location is better though."}
{"text":"Got a food delivery and it looks like puke. BENTO sushi is better  tbh and I'm a culinary student. Never again ."}
{"text":"My second time here. I thought I'd give it a second chance. This place is a bit disappointing. 
Service is quite slow. Wait staff is not very friendly. Menu items are often forgotten during peak buffet time. No one circulates to refill water. 
Food quality is okay, for the price. However, not always fresh. The fish is a bit dry with a sticky film on top. Edamame seems to be heated in the microwave and served without a side bowl to discard the skins. 
The lunch buffet is only $11.99 (doesn't include sashimi). The price is reasonable, and I'd probably return again in the future for that reason. However, don't expect too much for your money."}
{"text":"I just had lunch here with my sister. It was my first time, and i am not impressed. The food were either salty, TOO sweet (especially the eel sauce they use in almost everything) or too spicy.... Nothing caught my eye. Service was a 2.5/5 - forgetful waiters, and didn't know english. I showed her my coupon and had to repeat myself like 6 times... She said she'd ask her manager about it which she didn't. The food was OK... Ive had way better. The menu is pretty easy to understand and is pretty much like other menus from head to toe so you know what they have to offer. Menu is some paper and yeah.... we only ordered one round of food and left after 35 minutes or 30. I dont recommend this place... But give it a try if you wanna waste your money."}
{"text":"Came here first time with friends (no appetite, unfortunately) and came back with my brother, who was starving. My brother is a frugal guy, so even he agreed the prices were really good for a downtown sushi place! Especially with the Yelp Check-in 20% off our entire bill too!

Kimchi fries were good, sushi was fresh and good quality. Japa-dogs were my first time ever trying, and they were just ok. Overall a good experience, especially with the price-side. 

The staff was very helpful and attentive and, curiously, all very pretty."}
{"text":"Not the best place for all you can eat, believe me!
It is cheap (around 15$ for a lunch) but the foods they serve are not good quality. Suchis and rolls are not really good and the cooked food they serving are ridiculous: a snall bowl of rice with 2 pieces of beef for example. Please go to Mandarin, for 5$ more you got much better quality."}
{"text":"It's a good thing they have those ipads for you to pick out your food, because my server barely spoke English.

The Sui Mai was the worst I've ever had - anywhere.  They serve it at room temperature.  Maybe if it was hot it might be OK.  The shrimp dim sum was only a bit better.

The tempura maki was very nice.  The beef short rib was better than many places because Aji Sai cooks it lightly - so it's still soft and moist.  Some places turn it into dry leather.

The shrimp tempura was among the worst I've had.  It was a bit small, and the batter was meh, and there was just something really disappointing about the tempura sauce.  I think because it was not warm.

The onion rings were meh - with a blob of ketchup inside.  Eck.

The chicken wings were OK.  Not great, but not terrible.

The beef broth soup or whatever it was - was meh.  The beef was very bland - but my puppy liked it."}
{"text":"We were sat directly in view of the cleaning room and right in front of where the staff eat their meals (TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL). So in between wondering when the piles of dishes would go away when our food would ever come and staring at garbage bag clad dish washers walking in and out, as well as having to listen to the staff behind us actually MUNCHING their food and yelling out to the sushi bar, having a conversation, we noticed one improvement... That one really nasty waitress was gone. On our way out, I saw another staff member use the bar sink to wash his face.

Please Aji Sai... you have potential and you are so close to my house... can you please do the basics right?"}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed in my life with the service at a sushi place. You expect slow service at AYCE but this was beyond ridiculous. 

30 minutes to bring out 2 rolls. 

There are better sushi places in the neighborhood. 

On the pro side -  the sushi was fresh."}
{"text":"Service is AWFUL, food is pretty good.  Big AYCE menu.  The sushi is all right, not the best, but not bad.  I like the grilled items on the AYCE menu, and the desserts.  They close in the middle of the afternoon for a couple hours though, so if you're timing is off you can't have the AYCE--  it's really weird.  Also the servers seem to be very confused about everything and often things you order don't show up.  Once, the guy sitting at the table next to me got so fed up with the confusion with his orders that he just walked out.  I didn't blame him, from what I observed.  NOT a good idea if you have a short lunch.  Also, they seem to have DJs and loud music late at night, which is a turnoff for me.  Not sure what they're trying to do there."}
{"text":"Decent ramen.  This was a last minute dinner choice before a concert.  Definitely can't beat 8$ for the insane amount they give you,  cheaper than any fast food option. Although for 4$ more you could walk down the street for exceptional ramen.

Service was super slow though.  Especially while waiting for our bills. And quite frankly, the state of the restroom was embarrassing."}
{"text":"The usual.  Went here for a birthday one time. The sushi was average but their kimchi poutine was pretty damn good.  Wait staff can be a bit...aloof."}
