{"text":"I took my mother here to celebrate her 67th birthday and couldn't have been more disappointed with the quality of steaks we were served and the manger's refusal to honor a coupon.  I ordered the 22 oz. Delmonico steak  and my mom had the T-Bone steak both served medium well.   Both steaks were grainy, dry, and not flavorful.  My bill was just over $60.00, not bad considering what we ordered, however, I presented a discount coupon for $10.00 off my bill and the manager wouldn't honor it.  The waitress explained in order to receive the $10.00 discount, I needed to spend $60.00 prior to taxes being added to the bill.  Needless to say I was only $2.62 short from receiving the discount.  Mom said, just order another soft drink.  I refused to spend another penny at this point based on principle.  I didn't want to ruin  my mother's evening, but I thought to myself, \"What a crock of crap it was on the managers part to pull the \"READ BETWEEN THE FINE LINES\" card on me.  I didn't visually show my frustration, but I'll be lying to you'll if I told you my blood wasn't boiling inside.   However, I did have back-up, a second discount coupon for $5.00 which was honored because I spent over $30.00  Anyhow, I would never go back to this place again.  Instead, I'll stick to Longhorn Steakhouse or Brown Derby where I know the food is good and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"I had driven past Harry's a dozen times on Brecksville Road, and was always curious to check out this restaurant that towers over the road in a place you wouldn't necessarily think of as an ideal restaurant location.  When we arrived it was a rainy September evening; we decided to chance heading over without reservations, and even though it was 6:30 PM on a Friday evening, we didn't need them. The place was only about half full, which is still pretty busy, because the restaurant is large.  It has sort of a dude ranch vibe, with plank floors, rough walls, red checker table cloths, dim lighting, etc. The server was at our table within two minutes of our sitting down and remained pretty attentive throughout the meal.  My partner started with the French onion soup, a frequent choice of his at different restaurants.  He declared it good, but not incredible; it appeared to be at least partially home made, as the onions in the broth were not cooked down enough, and still had a little crunch to them.  Interestingly, instead of topping it with a slice of bread, they used a number of large croutons, over which they laid the cheese.  it did come out hot and the cheese was nicely melted.  He ordered the 12 oz. prime rib and I got the 16 oz. T-bone steak. While I didn't order a separate appetizer, both our meals came with salad, which is served family style - sort of like at the Olive Garden - but they give you your dressing in individual cups.  It was a pretty basic iceberg lettuce salad, with cheese, tomatoes, onions, some garbanzos, and maybe one or two other accoutrements.  He ordered the Caesar dressing and on the recommendation of a previous reviewer here, I tried the Italian dressing.  Both were fine, but I certainly didn't find the Italian dressing to be as impressive as the other reviewer indicated.  The meal also came with a basket of rolls, which were fairly good.  I think they baked them in house, but I couldn't swear to it.  It was a slightly sweet, white bread roll, and they offered both plain and cinnamon butter to go with them. I tried the cinnamon butter, and found it tasted like cinnamon toast - not exactly a taste combination I would have imagined to accompany steak, but I will give them points for trying something different.  Both of us ordered our entrees to be cooked to a \"medium\" finish, but we both felt that their medium was slightly rarer than we expected. We both agreed that we would have been better off with medium well.   Mine came with mashed potatoes that were very underwhelming. They were mashed with the skin on, which is fine, but overall they had a gluey quality and were not as hot as they should have been. He ordered his entree with well done fries, which came out very brown and good looking, but somehow failed to be as crisp as they looked or should have been.  In total we had 2 soft drinks, 1 appetizer, 2 beef entrees for $60, which included about a 20% tip.  The value seemed reasonable for the service and the quality.      Would I go far out of my way to eat at Harry's? No. Do I think I'll go back? Most likely. The place is not perfect but it's better than just okay, and they offer an early bird menu of two entrees for $16.99, which I consider to be a bargain for the product and service."}
{"text":"Good service, bad food. There were 6 of us and two meals were not prepared correctly and our appetizer of potato skins included a hair. Both were top sirloins, one was ordered medium and the other blue rare.  The first steak was over well and the second steak was medium rare on one end and well done on the other.  The server took our steaks back to be recooked with the same instructions.  The first steak came out barely cooked, supposed to be medium and the second came out blue rare as ordered.  The manager, who's name I did not receive did remove these items from our bill but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Portions and prices are very responsible. For a steak house there cooks seem to have a hard time cooking a steak. about half the time I dine in my steak is either over cooked or under cooked. When the cooks do get it right, the flavor is fantastic. I do enjoy there rib eye steaks. Side dishes taste great with good size portions. Hambergers are one of the best I have had."}
{"text":"The food is tasty I will give it that, but the place is dark and eerie, I'm sure its suppose to make it seem fancy but it just makes it feel like they will stab with that steak knife. Not to mention it took us eons just to get some gosh darn bread."}
{"text":"Well the place is very outdated inside. Dark as if right out of the late 70s or early 80s. With that being said,the food is OK at best. The bread and salad are pretty good. Steaks are descent. I've  have had the ribeye, sirlion,and fillet.   All were close to what I ordered,some over some under.  I don't know about drink prices as I drink water in a restaurant.      It is a nice break from the big chain steak houses. I do like to support a local small business when I can. With a remodel and some expirence d cooks this would be a great place to get a steak!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our service tonight, the server Jenna was very unprofessional, I will not be coming back to this restaurant in the future ."}
{"text":"If you want an \"old school\" steak house this is your place. No frills. I had the strip. My wife had BBQ rotisserie chicken. The steak was great.  Chicken was extremely moist. Rene was very friendly and efficient. Decent value too. We're coming back again for the ribs and chops."}
{"text":"Go here all the time with my girls. Service is always good, & food is consistently made well. The dinner rolls with cinnamon butter is excellent as well. Always recommend this place to people. And, it is near the movie theater so we can grab dinner afterwards."}
{"text":"My husband and I are on a quest for the best  $$ steakhouses in the US. This certainly qualifies as one. In fact I thought that the steaks were among the best in that category. The steaks were thick and well cooked. I had the Derby, a bone in strip, and my husband the Harry's strip. Both were beyond our expectations. The salad with house dressing was fresh and seconds were offered if we wanted them.  The service was a little slow, but that may have been our waitress because everyone else seemed very attentive.  Overall it is worth a visit. Don't expect fine dining, but do expect a decent steak at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Harry's steak house should be call Harry's tire shop. The steaks are dryer than my ex wife's humor, this place would have received a half a star but it wouldn't let me. I only recommend eating here if every other restaurant is closed including McDonald's."}
{"text":"My date and I went for dinner and to relax after a busy day. We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken. 10 minutes later we finally got our drinks, at least we got somebody's drinks. I ordered a Captain and Coke tall no fruit and she ordered an extra dry Grey Goose martini. I got a Captain and Pepsi in a rocks glass with 2 limes, my date got a dirty martini. I ordered prime rib with fries as a side. The fries were cold, limp, greasy, and very bland. I ordered the salad without cheese, it had cheese, had 2 ask for rolls twice, when they finally came they were hot on the outside but doughy on the inside. When we said something about the drinks I was told by my server that Harry's doesn't carry Coke products only Pepsi. I'm no great thinker but I think that bit of info should be relayed to anyone ordering a Coke product before pouring the drink. My dates drink was laughed off as the bartender \"Was slammed\" but nothing was done to try and fix our drinks"}
{"text":"We stop here about once a month for the 2 for $16.99 special.  Just the right size at a great price.  This Friday I had the baked scrod and my husband had the fried cod.  Both were tasty.  Our friends ordered the rotisserie chicken that smelled wonderful and looked juicy; they enjoyed it all."}
{"text":"Harry's is the best Steakhouse in the Cleveland area. Whether you are ordering off the value menu or a high end steak, you will not be disappointed. All of the staff is very friendly. You can't pass on the cinnamon butter on those fresh baked rolls. Harry's is a hidden gem. Well worth the ride to get there."}
{"text":"Just finished an amazing 1/2lb burger while out to dinner with my wife and son. Our burgers were cooked exactly to our liking. We added mushrooms and onions to our burgers and definitely got our money's worth. It's nice when you find a place that doesn't skimp out or cut corners. I grew up in the area and used to go there a lot up until the time we moved about 8 years ago. Boy am I glad Harry's is as good as I remember!    Another quick point: we got there late Saturday afternoon and were seated without a wait. The server was good and he even brought out our son's dessert early so my wife and I could finish our meals. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic reasonably priced steakhouse. The menu is fairly extensive and they have a variety of specials. I sat at the bar where the service was fast and friendly. I'm in my 40s and the crowd here makes me feel young. It seems like they have tons of regulars which is good. The casual atmosphere, good prices and great food have me visiting whenever I'm in town. Big portions too!"}
{"text":"I have had dinner here a few times a year for the last 10 years.   Never had a bad meal. Salad and bread are awesome. Love the salad dressing. Steaks are delicious. Sweet potatoes are huge and cooked perfectly. Also the half chicken is great too.   This place can be crowded. So be prepared to wait on some occasions. Go to the bar. Sometimes you can eat faster in there.   Prices are good for what you get. Service has always been good as well.   If in the area and want a good steak. Check this place out."}
{"text":"I go to Harry's fairly regularly also get take out. (Great big tasty burgers!) Last time had two grilled pork chops, very good. Came with a little portion of baked apples...nice touch and a loaded baked potato and unlimited salad with blue cheese dressing and crumbled blue cheese and warm rolls with cinnamon butter. Waitress was very nice!"}
{"text":"Terrible steak!  I went with a large group and more than one of the steaks were not cooked as we had requested. My medium rare bone-in Delmonico was very rare and barely warm.  It was also full of gristle. I could only choke down about 5 bites. The waitress asked if something was wrong and I explained it to her. She offered no apology or any compensation for my loss of $22.95 for a terrible steak. Others at our table ate only a few bites of their steaks, too."}
{"text":"Harry's is my go to steakhouse in the Cleveland area. Great steaks at an affordable price, and better than your neighborhood chains like Longhorn and Outback.   Harry's has an \"old school\" rustic atmosphere similar to Texas Roadhouse. We will sometimes dine here with a party of 10 or more and it's never an issue because they have plenty of seating and full bar area as well. Good selection of menu items raging from apps to sandwiches, steaks, seafood, chicken, & burgers.   Prime rib, Ribeye, and Delmonico Steaks are always tender and delicious. Never had to send something back. Entrees come with \"family\" style all you can eat salad (house dressing fantastic) which is a nice addition along with hot rolls.   Located in a nice area where you can go out to the bars after or catch a movie at Valley View."}
{"text":"Great steakhouse!  I've never had a bad steak here.   It's expensive steak house taste with a casual atmosphere.   Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"40 minute drive NOT worth it, so sad was favorite. have kids so always attend when NOT rush time, early dinners.  latest experience same as others, slow slow service-have to flag down for rolls or refills and check and box.  food not consistent.  dealt with manager \"harry\" unsure if owner but reeked of cigarettes and appeared intoxicated-hassled me on $5 kids meal being free-downright rude for $5-had better customer service @ McDonalds-that $5 was  added back to my bill and literally cost them my business-bad service too much for me.  Potato wasn't fully cooked or split-steak mostly fat, I will stick to Longhorn."}
{"text":"They have both a bar and  restaurant .... But my review is for restaurant ... We had a big Group 15 people. I ordered prime rib med rare.. It was decent ... Not best but not bad... I didn't like the ajus as much as other places but was ok.. It was cooked just right... Salad -- they only have one type it's iceberg with an Italian dressing.. It was decent... Also rolls we good and hot... This place also gets points for serving a big group at once... The host and waiters gave great service! Also was willing to do itemized Cks for 15 of us!!! And took 15 credit cards -- no hassle ! Atmosphere ... I would say very basic family restaurant style ... Prices very reasonable so great for family.... But if you want fancy atmosphere for date or special occasion this is not it... But heck this place delivers great value!"}
{"text":"I like going to Harry's Steakhouse. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The food is, to be honest, usually very good. I like the Boneless Pork chops on the \"Early Bird\" menu. These pork chops are simply the best pork chops that I have eaten in any restaurant, ever.  I have paid more than twice Harry's price at other restaurant's and been disappointed. Harry's has a nice selection of low priced meals if you arrive prior to 6:00 PM.  I do not normal purchase from this menu but I believe that you can buy 2 meals for about $15.  One can get a 10 oz. sirloin, chopped steak, grilled half chicken and more. The Martini's at Harry's are great.  I like mine dirty!  Good restaurant with good value for the dollar."}
{"text":"I would go 5 stars but would feel like that would bring them too many other customers! We love that we have NEVER had to wait for a table.  Great service, and the food is really good.   The Surf and Turf  is CONSISTANTLY great---and is only $26.  I usually go for the bacon wrapped filet and bigger than a football sweet potato. The kids love the hand-breaded corn dog and mash w/ thick gravy."}
{"text":"I have sadly disappointed after visiting Harry's. The food was okay. I ordered a steak ( there was nothing horrid about it yet there was nothing excellent about it) I went for a holiday party and wished the party would have been else where. I was very annoyed when it seemed like it took forever for our waitress to bring our check. I had somewhere to go be and around 20 minutes after you take people's plates away is a long time to wait. Ah well- will never go back but glad I tried it."}
{"text":"First time there in years. Food was  phenomenal, except for the salad. All iceberg lettuce and the tiniest bit of tomato. Prime rib perfectly cooked, great horseradish sauce, potatoes and veggies.  And the rolls and butter are melt in your mouth. My date didn't care for the large amount of mayo on her flounder, but it was good.  I wasn't too thrilled with the service towards the end of our meal. Our waitress, Maja, forgot about us after our last refill. She was efficient until we had to wait 10 minutes, then my date went to get a box for our leftovers because Maja didn't come back. Then Maja rushed over to our table ready to tackle my girl for helping herself to a to-go box. Not quite, but she seemed perturbed. Some of the busboys and servers also felt like they had the right of way when they were walking through, even the ones with nothing in their hands. No ' excuse me' or stepping to the side to let a customer through. I understand if they have a tray, but to just walk right in front of you is quite rude. We got our check, which was VERY reasonable considering the amount and quality of food.  Overall I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Great food and dining area, however the waitress only looked at my boyfriend to give the food and drink order to her like it was the 1950's."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I didn't quite enjoy Harry's after my boyfriend requested we come here  for his birthday.   The food quality is average at best. The steak had an odd taste to it I could not put my finger on as to the cause. I suspect it was the marinade they used, as it had a slightly astringent/alcohol taste. Perhaps too much Worcestershire? The cinnamon \"butter\" was good, but would have been better with hearty, homemade bread rather than overly processed dinner rolls that, although were hot and baked per order, tasted artificial and empty. The scalloped potato dish was decent; however, it lacked salt. While I appreciated the \"bottomless salad\", I specifically asked our server what in included ingredient wise, and after omitting the ingredients my boyfriend and I didn't want on our salad, it came back with cheese (which the server failed to mention the salad included in it). It wasn't a big deal, because although I don't prefer cheese on my salad, I don't have an allergy or aversion to cheese so I just said \"oh well!\" and ate it anyway. Not very knowledgeable on the servers part, however.   Although the service was polite and friendly, it was nearly nonexistent. Huge lags in time were observed throughout each step in our dinner. From getting greeted, to placing our order, to receiving our check. At first, I suspected our server was just busy with another large table in the other room that we weren't seeing. I was correct, as she apologized for taking some time to greet us and get drinks in as she was \"cashing out a large party.\" But after that, the service remained slow despite the restaurant only having two other tables at the time. I observed another table getting upset at (what I agree with) was a very long time to wait to get their food orders in. They finally flagged down the server, and in a slightly irritated tone said \"we've been ready!\" And the server said back in an uncomfortable exchange, \"All you had to do was ask! I thought you were waiting for another person!\" (Honest mistake, but having serving experience, one should never assume because the server wrongly assumed and the party could have had their meals in.) On a side note, that had no bearing on my star value, can we stop having servers write their name on the table? It's just a little cheesy and totally detracts from a classier steakhouse experience.  Overall I can't say I'll be back to Harry's or even comfortably recommend it. Perhaps with some changes in food quality and service Harry's can improve."}
{"text":"Went here for a meeting.  Seemed like a cool place.  I only had beverages but I would like to try the food menu."}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars just because I was visiting Cleveland and didn't really have much expectation for a place like this. I can't say I was impressed but it is a lower level steak house.  The food was actually good ,I enjoyed the family style salad and ordered the filet medium rare with sweet potato .  The steak was cooked perfectly and the sweet potato with the cinnamon butter is delicious .  We were a big group and everyone ordered different steaks and everything looked really good ,the Pinot noir was pretty good for being the house .light to medium body with hints of stone fruits and cherries . The wine paired great with my leaner filet cut .   I was disappointed by the management and the lack of hospitality from both the owner and his management staff . They were not accommodating and a bit rude .honestly didn't see a single smile come out of there face which shows to me that they are either in the wrong business or doing it wrong .  I was also disappointed to see that they didn't offer sparkling water as a water option .however during my visit , I realized a few places in Cleveland do not carry it .   To end on a lighter note ,even though the restaurant is old ,dark and outdated . It was actually clean and well maintained ."}
{"text":"Stopped here visiting the Cleveland area. Rolls and salad were very good. I got the Flounder stuffed with crabmeat which was out of this world. My fiancé got the 8 oz sirloin which was cooked perfectly. Our server, Julie, was super attentive and very nice! The only downside was that we were seated next to an obnoxious fat lady who was loud and overbearing, especially after not getting her steak prepared right!"}
{"text":"Harry's is a great family priced steakhouse with quality cuts at reasonable prices.  We have always received great service (in the dining room or at the bar) and we have yet to leave disappointed.  Keep in mind. this is a casual steakhouse, not Mortons, but here you can get a bacon wrapped filet for under $20 including sides.  The fresh rolls with cinnamon butter are a bonus.  They also have great burgers, ribs & grilled chicken & shrimp.  If you want a steak night out at a reasonable price, you can't go wrong with Harry's."}
{"text":"Horrible,  came in and ordered a porterhouse steak and when it arrived,  the steak was small and thin. My girlfriend got a T-bone and the steak was bigger and thicker. And the porterhouse is normally bigger. Bad experience"}
{"text":"Quite simple. If you are going out to eat why not go to a place that has pretty damn good food. Harry's fits the bill for just such a place. The salad and rolls are just icing on the cake."}
{"text":"This is a homestyle steak house. The atmosphere is very old style   A small step above the chains.  French onion soup was below par.  The prime rib was well seasoned and cooked to a perfect mid-rare.   Sides are very homemade looking and lacking elevation."}
{"text":"Decent place with a variety of menu items. Most entrees come with the bottomless salad, which I'm a fan of, especially the house Italian dressing. I've come here a number of times and have gotten the sirloin steaks, Hawaiian chicken, and stuff flounder, each item was pretty good. The prices are very reasonable and I'll definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"Better service could have left me with a better taste in my mouth about Harry's. A pretty cool place out in the Independence area with great prices. It has mixed remnants of other places. Family style salad like olive garden with no cheese add chick pea, rolls like Logans Steakhouse soft and sweet. They serve them with regular and cinnamon butter. I preferred regular butter.  Wooden booths and red checkered table clothes with white butcher paper made me think 'standard steakhouse'  but the place is huge. Anyway, back to the service. 4 top table, not needy, having to flag down for refills and really had to ask for any need when she came by to check up. Then, once the check was paid, she never came back to clear dirty plates,  or serve drink refills while we chatted for 30 minutes more when they weren't very busy. I saw the tip, it was a full 20% so it wasn't that.   I ordered the chopped steak and it was perfectly fine. I did need A1, but that's pretty typical unless the meat is something stellar. Got the baked potato side- it came unsplit, which I found odd. Dad got the bacon wrapped filet. Loved it. Brother got the center cut chops and sweet potato. The latter is a good use for that cinnamon butter. Uncle got the lobster tails. He seemed to enjoy them.   We drove 45 minutes to get to this place and I wouldn't do that again, but for that area it's a good dinner option for those who like steakhouses. Just hope your service is more on their game."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, nothing wrong, just good, straightforward american fare.  Have only ever been here for business meetings that were served buffet style, but the food aways looks good."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Harry's for a very long time and just honestly always forgot about it. I had heard good things so I was excited to try it and I gotta say I was not that impressed. It wasn't the worst but certainly wasn't anywhere near the best. I just went with the 8 oz sirloin. It was a little on the tough/well done side and I asked for medium well. The seasoning was not impressive, seemed like it was seasoned it just pepper.   The French onion soup was pretty good. But I would be more inclined to go somewhere else to try a bowl or somewhere I've been and have liked their soup.   Overall, I am in no hurry to return but that's not to say I would never."}
{"text":"This place has burger specials for 4.50 with a side of fries or onion rings if you sit in the bar area. The entire meal was delicious! The bartender was super nice and had worked at the restaurant before it Harry's. They had great selection of beer and The bartender was able recommended beer that would pair well with the burger. She was spot on. The bar area also has free popcorn. Highly recommend for a cheap night out with friends."}
{"text":"First time here and was pleasantly surprised. You don't find a better waitress than Jen, so attentive & so sweet. I ordered flounder stuffed with crab & shrimp & loved it.  My sweet potato was the largest I've ever seen & excellent. My husbands steak was a little more done than wanted but he still enjoyed it. Salad was plentiful & just right. Will be back for sure. Price was right also."}
{"text":"We were a table of five and all of us had the prime rib.  Our waiter was very attentive and the food was good.  You will not find a bigger sweet potato anywhere!  This was our first visit and we will return."}
{"text":"Over the last 10 years or so my family and I have been regulars and always love the service and food.  T-bone is wonderful and since I like my steak med. rare, I can reheat the leftover's the next day without over cooking the steak to death.  The appetizer's are ok though....I think they could be better.  But we usually skip the app's anyway."}
{"text":"Went to Harry's today for the Thanksgiving buffet. First, let me say how organized the staff was I n the face of being slammed. We had a 4pm reservation, got there at 340pm and were seated at 405pm. We both had the buffet - veggies, mashed, stuffing, pasta, and carve to order ham, roast beef and turkey. The meal included a family style salad bowl served at the table, delicious rolls, and a dessert buffet.  By the way, Maria was an outstanding waitress!  We sat in the main dining room and my only complaint was that the restaurant was so full it was difficult navigating between the tables to get to the buffet. All in all, a great experience for a very reasonable price - buffet was $24.95/adult. We will return to sample the regular menu."}
{"text":"Wow, probably the worst dinning experience in years! The wait was 25 minutes, not terrible. What was terrible was the fact that it took 40 minutes to get someone to take our drink order to start!!  In those forty minutes the server came over two times to tell us she'd be right over! I finally called the Manager over to ask why we can't even order our drinks in 40 minutes! No reason was given. We stayed because we didn't want to try all over again at another place. Our mistake! My wife gave her meal a B-, my ribs were undercooked and tough! By the way, the server must have  had another job as a magician because she disappeared every time we looked for her! Suffice to say, even though it's a neighborhood restaurant, it'll be a long time before we try it again! The problem in my opinion was definitely management! He didn't take the initiative to check kitchen flow or manage customer check in! A couple extra servers would also have helped!"}
{"text":"This place is dark and danky.  We were told they had prime rib and then 20 minutes later were told they didn't have it.  We spoke to the manager Nick and he said \"TOO BAD\"......  I have never been treated like such crap... in a crap dank place...  Service =0 Food=2"}
{"text":"One of my favorites places to eat. I've received great service along with great tasting food like their steaks, crab stuffed mushrooms and rolls to boot. A very nice atmosphere. I've never been disappointed. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I came in here with no expectations, as I was attending with a  a really large group. 1st thing I noticed this place is can be measured in enorms. Crazy big, they had some drink of the day that was blue, I alway stay away from that kind of thing usually ends up tasting like kool-aid, nothing again kool-aid but not when it involves alcohol. My friend had one and she agreed with that assessment.  Salad: Served family style, mixed greens, onion, croutons, cheese, pepperonici and Italian salad dressing. Pretty good.  The meat:  Split the 22 ounce delmomico which was probably half bone. Meat was grilled to a perfect medium, and had a nice grill marks and was well seasoned. Split this with someone as I was not in the mood for that much. It was actually perfect amount of meat. Oh there was very little waste as well.   Sides I requested the veg of the day and it was a medley of broccoli, carrots, and green beans. Decent but nothing special. Also ordered the sautéd onions and shrooms, they were excellent. Friend had a sweet potato the size of my frigging head.  Many people had the mashed potatoes, they looked pretty spectacular.  That staff was  effecient and friendly. Overall this was decent for the price point. I would comeback to meet friends but probably not seek it out."}
{"text":"It was alright. I had bacon wrapped filet with scalloped potatoes; the 'tatoes had a strange tangy flavor"}
{"text":"Really had a bad experirence on New years  potatoes 3 X   the size of the steak.  I ordered stuffed flounder with stuffed crab and shrimp never did find any shrimp don't think I will be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Ok...so we decided to give it another try.  We will not be going back a third time.  It's the kind of place you want to like, but just have to accept it's not going to get any better.  We ordered a bacon wrapped filet and crab stuffed steak.  Meals were served with salad and choice of side.  I opted for sweet potato and she opted for garlic mashed potatoes.  Meals were served appropriately cooked but inappropriate temperature.  Crab was cooked in steak drippings.  Bread rolls were stale.  Service was nothing to brag about.    Better to go to the valley steak establishments  Meh meh!"}
{"text":"This local gem is off the beaten path but definitely worth the little bit of effort to find it. It's not as fancy as Red or Morton's, but for the price, it's great! It's a perfect spot for a large group and they also have a party room upstairs. They have great early bird specials where you get two dinners for $16.49 TOTAL. And Monday is prime rib night ($23.79 with seconds) The rolls are amazing and the sweet potatoes are as big as your head."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant with very nice staff our food was hot and deliver to us in a timely fashion. I really enjoy this restaurant and I will definitely tell my friends and come again. The only downside about this restaurant is it's extremely cold. And I don't mean just a little bit cold it was so cold and make my fingertips numb other than that the restaurant is great"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Harry's. We had an excellent dinner. I ordered the stuffed flounder. My husband ordered a cheeseburger. My Dad ordered prime rib. Everything including sides were delicious. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We decided to come here vs Independence Tavern just down the road since the parking lot was full!   Entering through the front door we were greeted with the aroma of charred cow flesh and the smell reminiscent of a 70s hotel. While these may sound like a negative, I found it endearing and exciting as well!  The rest of the atmosphere was a mistrust of a Western Sizzlin' meets Stake and Ale.   After a quick seating we were introduced to an all American menu of burgers, steaks, and seafood among other goodies! The friendly waitstaff nabbed our order and we solved our hunger pangs with fresh hot rolls and cinnamon butter! The fillet had good flavor but a tad dry, and the cheeseburger was large and tasty. The veggies were all fresh!  Most delightful was the restaurant full of lovely patrons dressed in their Sunday best! Here it seems like home...check em out!"}
{"text":"We were going to try a steakhouse up in Cleveland for Restaurant Week, but I saw a couple reviews stating that this place was better, for half the price. So we were pretty excited to try this place out. I would say overall, we were a little underwhelmed.   We walked in around 8:30pm and were worried about the wait, because the placed looked packed. We actually got seated and got our drink order placed within 5 minutes though. We decided to order an appetizer of Mozzarella sticks and received those and our salad within 10 minutes of sitting down. We were pretty impressed. We placed our orders and tried the sticks. I thought they tasted like they were the kind you find in the frozen food aisle at GFS, but they weren't awful. Rolls were warm and fresh from the oven with regular and cinnamon butter. Honestly, our food didn't take too long to come out, even with a packed house. I will point out however, that I asked for a baked potato and had to go with the mashed, because the wait for the baked potato was over a half-hour. I was happy that the waitress let me know, but still kind of disappointed. I also heard another waitress tell a table beside us that they are running out of everything tonight and he can't have something replaced. Thought that was a little weird. I get that it's Saturday night, but you are a steakhouse... Our steaks were kind of a disappointment. Neither seemed to have any flavor and the sirloin was really really tough. I had asked for medium and it came out a LOT more pink than expected.   The staff was nice and the food came out really quick. I wish it all had more flavoring, but that's not a make-or-break for me. I don't think we will be coming back here for steak, but I'm sure we'll try it again someday for lunch."}
{"text":"My review is in response to reviews I've read .. Harry's is not Red Steakhouse or Ruth's Chris .. Harry's prices are a fraction of what a person would pay at those places .. my friend and I had the $16.99 dinners which included two dinners .. I had chicken stir fry which was quite good .. my friend had top sirloin which she said was also good .. it was a fairly small steak of good quality ...for the price we weren't expecting a huge steak .. each entree came with a side salad which was crisp and delicious and we ordered a side of Potatoes Au Gratin which at $2.99 was an amazing deal .. I haven't had potatoes au gratin since I was a kid . I'll go back to Harry's if for no other reason than the potatoes ... I noticed one reviewer was unhappy she had to pay for drinks .. and the $2.50 for a bottle of spring water .. I highly recommend Harry's for people who want comfort food at very low prices ..surpassed what I would have expected ... By the way , there really is a Harry and he made the rounds going to each table and asking about our meals .. that in itself was impressive"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Harry's on a recommendation from friends when we were staying at a B&B in the Cleveland area.  We were looking for a good steak without paying the ridiculous prices we were seeing as we searched around the Cleveland area.    We don't need fancy-schmantzy when going out to dinner, and Harry's isn't.  But the food was delicious, they had a very good beer selection and we really enjoyed ourselves.  The salad in the big bowl was very good and it was nice that you could put your own dressing on because we prefer different dressings.  I got the 16 oz cut of prime rib prepared medium and my wife got a strip steak prepared med-rare.  I would usually order med-rare, but read some reviews that made me think they tended to undercook, so I went medium.  My wife's steak was a little under med-rare but it was hot so she was happy and did not send it back.   Our service was very good and we enjoyed Harry's.  We would gladly return."}
{"text":"Great meal! We went today, and took advantage of their 2 for $16 lunch. Wonderful deal! Meal comes with bread (butter, and cinnamon butter which was delicious), decent size salad, choice of meat/seafood, with a side- for 2! We all left with boxes! Service was fantastic. Very friendly and welcoming. The inside is nicely decorated without being too stuffy. You are able to see the chefs through a glass window. The outside is a little disappointing - it could use a little cleaning and updating - it just doesn't do the place justice! Definitely a must go!"}
{"text":"I'm here on business visiting from the Atlanta area.  I like trying different places when I'm out of town - I figure why fly hundreds of miles just to see an Aplebees....  So, I found this place via Yelp.  I kinda like the place; laid-back atmosphere, good beer, not too loud.  The salad was pretty good; I'd compare it to a tossed salad like you might receive at an Italian restaurant.  The rolls were hot, fresh and tasty, and the choices of real butter or cinnamon butter were interesting.  I had scalloped potatoes with my steak.  They were probably the best scalloped potatoes I've ever had at a restaurant.  Unfortunately, the steak was sub-par.  I could tell that it had spent a lot of time soaking in meat tenderizer, rendering it flavorless and kind of grainy.  The addition of salt and A1 Steak Sauce made it taste better, but the texture of over-tenderized steak was still there.    If not for the not-so-awesome steak, I'd rate this place higher, but it was what it was.  Hopefully, they were just having an off night with the steak."}
{"text":"If you like overpriced, dried out, flavorless steak then this place is for you. The prime rib was as dry as the Sahara Desert that even my steak knife broke in half. McDonald's is better than this place!"}
{"text":"I had not been to Harry's Steakhouse since the 90's when I went there for prime rib with my family.  I do remember it being very good, but for whatever reason just never made it back there. Everything about this place was awful! After about 10 minutes our server \"Molly\" came to us for our drink order.  She had the personality of a paper towel.  Kind of like one of those experiences where you ask yourself \"Why would this person become a server when you have to cater to the public, both good and bad, and do it all with a smile and for tips?\"  She looked bothered to be there.  Brought out some rolls and salad.  Both were ok, might seem nitpicky to judge rolls and salad, but hey, it is part of the experience.  The rolls seemed weirdly dense with a weird texture.  Definitely had that frozen roll quality, but whatever..........they were passable.  My wife and I both got a variation of prime rib, mine larger and medium, her's medium well.  It is always funny to me how steak doneness is one of the most common mistakes in restaurants that pride themselves in steak!  Mine was rare and not medium rare, just rare.  I actually prefer mine medium rare but have got in the habit of going for the medium because most places can't do medium rare well.  My wife's steak was well done and dry as a bone.  Both steaks were cold, not warm, cold! It appeared as if most of the servers there were more concerned about their sidework than any of the patrons there.  I only saw one guy with a tie, ducking in and out here and there and never once even so much as made eye contact with a customer.  This place was not that full either for a Saturday night at 8 o'clock.  The server offered to replace our steak and I told her not to worry about mine as I personally felt that it was less to do with the temperature and more to do with the flavor. I remember my prime rib from this place having an amazing bark on it.  I won't soon forget it, it was incredible.  This time around, the steaks tasted like they were marinated in water and cooked with zero seasoning.  When the server brought my wife's steak back, it was in fact hot but somehow tough as leather and did not even resemble prime rib.  The server never came back to ask us how everything was until way way later, like where the hell is the check later.  You would have thought she might have pretended to be concerned as she was working for a tip.  Now , I am not one of those a-holes that thinks another human being has to cater to my every whim just because they are a server.  I honestly was just hoping to get one simple thing......... a sincere apology!  When she finally did bring the bill, she said \"he discounted the one steak for you\"  oh by the way my wife ate a grand total of two bites of both steaks.  She was starving when we left.  I just wished I would have had the chance to meet \"he\".  So a manager was aware of the problem and never even bothered to show his face?? Appalling.  My wife and I both concluded that if our server would have just been a little apologetic, it would have went a long way.  AVOID THIS PLACE!!! Below average food, below average service......what else is there\"?"}
{"text":"The name says it all! Nearly choked to death on multiple pieces of hair that was cooked to perfection and attached to my mushrooms and onions. But wait, they did take $5.00 off my bill. Glad that me choking and my loss of appetite on New Years Day was worth so much. Not to mention the manager never even stopped by our table to apologize. Used to be a great place for a quiet meal, anymore it has an old stale smell as soon as you walk in, food is very bland no seasoning at all. As you can see in my picture, they slap a big plain baked potato on your plate and don't even cut it or rub some salt on it. Nothing.  Anymore it feels like I'm eating at a nursing home. Waitresses are o.k. Long time customer very dissatisfied with last visit, not planning on returning until some changes are made."}
{"text":"Came here for my grandfathers birthday with the family to celebrate. My expectations certainly weren't high, but still everything was extremely underwhelming, and just \"ok.\" The service was ok. The atmosphere is actually pretty cute and I like the open concept kitchen with glass windows where I you can watch it being cooked but really just a cute novelty. The food was ok. All of the steaks were kind of a crumbly consistency and almost all of the 6 steaks ordered were overcooked. You do get a large amount of food but the quality is very...eh. No, it's not Mortons nor XO and I never expected that out of this joint, but keeping that in mind for the price I've been a lot more impressed with bigger chain joints like Texas Roadhouse. I won't be giving it a second chance."}
{"text":"After reading a few reviews mentioning good prime rib, I decided to try Harry's Steakhouse as I didn't feel like venturing too far from the hotel. What a bad choice!! It started with the long wait to get service. Once a waitress finally came by, I was told happy hour only in bar area although I was seated at table in the bar. I then ordered a medium rare prime rib with a side of coconut shrimp. The entree came out before my dinner rolls and soup. I was disappointed that my prime rib looked more well done than medium. The shrimp was okay while the marmalade sauce was entirely too sweet. Never have I wanted to leave leftovers."}
{"text":"$2.50 for a glass of water ... sirloin was tenderized by beating My wife and I went for late lunch/early dinner in September. There were several early bird specials for just under $17 for two meals. The banner on the front of the building failed to mention that two drink orders were required. We promptly seated. Decore was a bit on the dark side. Waiter was friendly and prompt. I ordered a beer and my wife ordered a glass of water. I was told not to worry that we did not have the second required drink order but I went ahead and ordered my wife a Margarita. Salads were fresh and promptly served. Meals were fresh and hot. My wife's water with a lemon in it cost $2.50. My steak was not bad but had been obviously tenderized via pounding. The seats in the booth were in dire need of repair as the springs were sagging so one basically was sitting on boards. we may venture back to try the burger specials in the bar area and NOT order that apparently exclusive and expensive \"Ponce de León fountain of youth\" water again."}
{"text":"Fabulous!! Great service...outstanding meals! Truly a class act!! There is no shortage of choices at the bar...and no skimping either. The menu has something for everyone...with daily specials. Has always been a family favorite!!"}
{"text":"I really liked Harry's.  My daughter and I went there last night before a show and we were greeted immediately and shown to our seats.  The staff was very friendly and our waitress was very helpful.  (She even poured my glass of wine herself because the bar staff was busy and she felt I had waited long enough!)  My daughter got the sirloin steak with garlic mashed potatoes and said everything was really good.  I got the prime rib and au gratin potatoes.  Both our steaks were cooked perfectly.  The potatoes were very good, too.  I've had really greasy au gratin potatoes before but these were really good.   Prices are very reasonable, too.  For the 2 of us, it was about $43.00 which included my glass of wine and my daughter's lemonade.   They have a 2 for $16.95 dinner menu that looks really good and the price can't be beat. I quickly looked at the happy hour menu and it looked like they had a decent food selection as well as drink prices.  We will be back."}
{"text":"After a reluctant second chance I am glad I tried this place!   I have to say that I had to REALLY give this place a chance or second chance rather because my first time dealing with this restaurant was unappealing.    I had called during the week for their dinner two for $16.49.  I understood their was a window of time for this deal; Monday thru Friday 3:30 pm - 6:00 pm.  This appeals to the working class, 9 am-5 pm employees and the mature middle aged group of men and women who still have dinner at a decent time instead of other establishments who serve dinner \"specials\" from 6-9 or even until closing.  Going back to my first experience here, I admit, here and now, that I made the mistake of calling at 5:55 pm.  By the time I finally got through to someone after being on hold it was just after 6 pm so I was hoping for leniency and generosity on this potential order.  I did not have such luck and what was even MORE unsettling was that fact that the server first implied that the 2 dinners for $16.49 was ONLY A DINE IN OPTION??  I did not see that mentioned or listed anywhere.  In fact, if you look on their website it is EXTREMELY misleading that they mention and list on their website in BIG, bold red letters \"Harry's 2 Go!\" followed by their phone number to call them and order.  This is then followed by, in the same big red font, \"2 Dinners for $16.49\".  I was upset by this statement.  When I first called I had spoken to an employee and asked, \"I know it's late but can I still order the 2 Dinners for $16.49?\".  This first employee said, \"Yes, I we can still do that for you. Please hold and someone will take your order.\"  They proceeded to put me on hold while someone picked up the line.  A second employee picked up the line and already did not sound happy from the start.  I asked him about the \"2 Dinners for $16.49\".  He immediately replied, \"It's after 6, this deal has passed today but that deal is Dine-In only.\"  This confused me and I was thrown back because there was no indication of this being Dine-In only.  I told him, \"The first employee I spoke to said you could still do the deal since I called before 6 pm and I didn't know it was Dine-In only.\"  This employee became very blunt and said, \"Well, I'll talk to this employee but I guess I can give it to you this time if the computer will let me.\"  There was NO need for him to be condescending for any reason.  A few seconds later he replied, \"No, the computer will not let me do it anyway.\"  I was so put off by this behavior that I just replied okay and hung up.    This whole experience really had me contemplate ever trying them again.  I can honestly say that on this day the ONLY two reasons I tried them were, ONE: I had a coupon and TWO: The coupon made Harry's Steakhouse cheaper than Outback Steakhouse.  What is disappointing about ordering from Harry's is that you can ONLY order over the phone, there is NO online ordering feature.  I still decided to try it.  Between my roommate and myself we ordered the 16 oz. Ribeye, and the 1/2 slab of ribs with chicken dinner along with two 'crocks' of French Onion soup.  Each dinner came with one side (we both ordered the mashed potatoes) and (this impressed me the most) a FULL size salad! I mean a 9\"x 9\" Styrofoam container full of salad.   With my coupon our WHOLE meal came out to $49 and some change!  It may sound like a lot to pay for dinner on a Sunday night but picture this: Two plastic grocery bags filled to the top on each of them with food!  5 large Styrofoam containers filled with food.  2 LARGE main courses, 2 large salads and 1 container for about half a dozen rolls with butter and cinnamon butter. Plus 2 round 8 oz. containers containing French Onion soup and then 2 more 8 oz. containers containing mashed potatoes.    Upon arrival I had to wait in the lobby because I had no idea where to go for take-out and there were no signs.  When the hostess greeted me, I said I ordered take-out.  She told me to go sit at the bar. REALLY?? For take-out?  This was unusual to me and on a Sunday evening (after the Browns lost again) the bar was filled with middle-aged men and women who had more than a few drinks so finding just a place to sit at the bar was hard.  The food made ALL of this a positive experience that I was able to look past the previous service.  My roommates steak was an excellent piece of rib eye, My ribs were tender but my chicken was slightly dry in the outside but juicier towards the center.  The mashed potatoes were AMAZING.  They are REAL potatoes with small pieces of the skin in them (if you like that though) and added some flavor with a lot of salt like some I've had in the past.  To top it off they do have one of the BEST French Onion soups I've had anywhere and will DEFINITELY be trying that again!    Overall, the food did overshadow the service in this case.  I would recommend this steakhouse to anyone to give a chance to with the hope of having a similar food quality with BETTER service"}
{"text":"Live the 3:30pm special two for 16.99!! 6oz, side and salad!! My steak is always medium rare perfection!! I love the crowd love the company everyone is always very nice! This is most def a go to if your anywhere in this area!!"}
{"text":"Always a great meal. It's old school and that's why we love it. Early birds and and always consistent. Great family or couple all around great place. One of our favorites."}
{"text":"Came to Cleveland for work and thought I gotta have steak the hotel recommended this place for the good steaks and the view. I wish I would of got picture of the food and the view but I was too hungry. I got he filet and loaded baked potato let me tell you soooo good. Def stop if your in Ohio. View was beautiful of the skyline of downtown it's was perfect during sunset."}
{"text":"I gotta give Harry's four stars based on our recent visit.  We called ahead to take my parents out for a steak dinner.  When we arrived, we waited approximately two minutes and then six of us were seated.  Our waitress showed up quickly and took our drink orders.  She was fast and friendly the entire night.  Everyone ordered steak except for me, who loves chicken, mushrooms, and onions.  I ordered a side of veggies too.  We were served bread and a large bowl of salad, which was really good.  The restaurant is really large and they were very busy, but they still brought our food pretty quickly.  My chicken was very tasty as were the shrooms and onions.  Also, my steamed veggies were nicely seasoned and they were tasty.  I really liked my meal.  The steaks looked and tasted very good - much better than on our last visit.  I didn't think we'd come back here, but the other steak houses were jam packed on a Friday at 7pm.  We got right in!  I will visit again."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where the price and the food spells good value.  The food is not the most awesome but it is GOOD for the price you pay.  I hope this makes sense.  They aren't super expensive like the steak houses near by.    The steaks are always cooked to temperature and flavored well.  The sides are well done and the bread/rolls are delicious with the cinnamon butter.    I will definitly be back, they are a friendly place to bring your kids and a quick date night with the hubby."}
{"text":"Just came home from a great dinner at Harry's. This was my and my husband's first time dining there.  The atmosphere is comfortable, classic rough hewn wood, hardwood flooring, and tables/booths a plenty. There were other patrons in business casual attire, we were in jeans and tee shirts and did not feel uncomfortable.   He ordered one of the burgers (bigger something, forgot the name of it) and I had the full rack of ribs. We started with the bacon and cheese fries which were probably big enough for 4-6 so we took most of it home. My dinner came with a salad and I had the Italian dressing. I HIGHLY recommend the Italian if you like good garlic flavor and some nice savory bite. My husband and I also found it delicious for dipping the freshly baked bread. The bread was also delightful with the cinnamon sugar whipped butter it came with.  He couldn't finish his burger which was mouthwateringly juicy and seasoned. The onion rings he had were also wonderful. I ordered the full rack of ribs (for $4 more than the half rack, why not have another meal out of it tomorrow?!) I enjoyed the slightly sweet and exquisitely tangy BBQ sauce with the fall-off-the-bone smokey rib meat. I also took a great deal of my dinner home. We didn't even attempt dessert, maybe next time though. For 2 soft drinks, an appetizer, and 2 dinners the bill came to $47. This will give us at least another meal each tomorrow.  The waitress was very friendly and prompt at her service. There were 2 other tables next to us where different servers were friendly and talkative with their customers.   We will definitely return here, and we will bring friends and family. Unquestionably worth the money."}
{"text":"We attended a sports banquet at Harry's Steakhouse and one of your employees named Sean, did an outstanding job!! My grandma is 80 years old  and has to use a walker with a seat and wheels. Sean took it upon himself to make sure she was attended to while we pulled the car around. Then he brought her down the ramp to the car and made sure she was safely in. He also went back to tell my sister that we were ready to leave. He is such a thoughtful employee. We remember he was once a server and we always had great service from him. He also made sure our steaks were done how we like them. We attended a banquet last year for the same sports event  and with him in charge this year, we sure noticed a definite improvement. Sean definitely deserves the credit. He is an exceptional employee!!! We have been coming to Harry's for years, great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Harry's is really very good.  It isn't fancy.  The steaks aren't those modern, high-end kind such as you get at Ruth's Chris. I would describe everything about it (the decor, the service, the menu, the style of preparation of the steaks, the selection of sides) as a throw-back to the 1970s.  And that's a good thing!  No cold, loud, granite tables.  No hip waiters muttering about cage-free poultry.  The prices are reasonable.  The service is comfortable.  It doesn't push the envelop on creativity or sophistication. You can definitely come as you are (maybe to a fault?).  I wouldn't call it gourmet, but it is very, very good.   P.S. The fish and burgers and pork chops are good, too."}
{"text":"Harry's is about what you would expect it to be.  They serve burgers, steaks, etc. just do not expect your steak to be cooked correctly.  None of these suburban steakhouses can cook a steak properly, especially if you are in a large group.    The restaurant was clean and dimly lit.  I was okay with the place, until I stopped in the restroom on the way out.  Any restaurant with a bathroom this dirty and run down cannot be trusted.  I was going to give three stars, but the manager working this afternoon just did not seem to care, and he seemed rude.  It must be safer to eat at a chain steakhouse, than at Harry's."}
{"text":"The Ribs are good; nice moist taste and their sauce is good as well.  The service is friendly and attentive.  I wish they had more variety when it came to their side dishes, like mac and cheese but the experience was pretty good."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are fairly large! Ribs are always tender and are never dry! Baked sweet potato and the cinnamon butter was so savory. Highly recommend this steakhouse! Harry's never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Love Harry's! Reasonable prices, great prime rib, not too stuffy, nice atmosphere. And the dinner rolls are great too!"}
