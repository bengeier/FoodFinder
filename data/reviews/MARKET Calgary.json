{"text":"My wife and I arrived tonight with no reservation expecting a great dining experience, but left a bit disappointed. The food was rather quite good, we shared the potato skins, I had the chicken and my wife had the pumpkin gnocchi. My chicken good; cooked well and the barley was tasty. My wife's gnocchi was amazing. Unfortunately the service was slow and terrible. First warning sign was that our server could barely make it through the specials without screwing up. She showed up infrequently and at the end of our meal, took us 30 min to get the debit machine so we could pay.   The food was quite good, albeit a bit pricy, but I wouldn't go here again due to the service."}
{"text":"Read about this restaurant in avenue magazine.   Was on 17th in search of lunch location on a sunny day and my friend and I decided to give it a try!  Cute little patio the down side to that was someone needed to be on wasp patrol!!  But we toughed it out as we did not want to wast a beautiful day by sitting inside.  The Restaurant has great look and feel and the food was very good.  The only thing I would point out is the cost of a Caesar was much higher than any other restaurant I have been too and no where near as tasty."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. We went for lunch on a Sunday - maybe not the best time. The restaurant was very noisy. We asked for another table but there were no other tables available unless we want to sit on the high chairs at the window counter.  In retrospect, that may have been better. There was a party of 3 right next to us and the noisy bar on the other side so conversation was out of the question.  We could hardly hear the server describe the specials. We both ordered the daily soup - a fennel and leek cream soup with bacon on top. Very delicate flavour almost to the point of bland. This says a lot as I rarely use salt at the table and only add small amounts in my cooking.  There is no salt and pepper on the table - you have to ask for it. A small amount comes in a container with a spoon.  For our next course, I had the steak sandwich and my partner had the chicken pot pie. The server told me that the steak sandwich is cooked to medium rare, sliced and served on a slice of sourdough bread with some argula and aioli.  I missed the bit about fries so I sent those back as I don't eat fries. They are actually potato wedges and you get a large bowl of them. They offered me a salad instead.  You don't get a choice of dressing and while there is a nice selection of fresh greens and toppings, I found the dressing did nothing for the salad. My partner's chicken pot pie was a flat bed of puff pastry with a chicken stew on top. It was very tasty and he enjoyed it.    For dessert, we shared a slice of carrot cake with a very tangy lemon icing. I found the flavour of the icing overwhelmed the carrot cake. Less lemon and it would have been very good.They also brought us two pink french macaroons because they were not able to move us to a better table which was very thoughtful. Now lets talk coffee. I ordered coffee which is good if you like it very strong and I do.  When our server offered a refill, I declined saying not right now. When I looked for my cup to ask for a refill, it had disappeared! I am sure  the server would have brought me another cup had I asked.  Tables here are small and the dishes are large so I see why she took it away but I  think she could have asked me if I wanted more coffee before she did that.  On the plus side, service was very prompt and requests were taken care of immediately. They grow their own herbs. and the ketchup is made in-house. It is delicious. It must be popular because they sell large jars of it for you to take home.  So should you try this place? Yes  - go at a quieter time if you want to talk. Do make a reservation and ask for a table by the side windows  - little quieter there. Ask if other options are available if you are told something is prepared or served a certain way. There are always fixed priced menus at lunch - 3 courses for 25 dollars.  And leave your kids at home - this is not a kid friendly restaurant unless you a toting a small baby in a seat bucket."}
{"text":"Wow great place.  They put a LOT of thought into the dishes.  Try to source or make everything local.  House made preserves and fantastic Ketchup to go with Parmesan Fries.  They even have an indoor green house in the back for herbs and micro-greens.  I felt this place could plop down in Portland and be right at home.  Our group of three decided to get a whole bunch of appetizers and share.  It is a great way to try a variety of dishes.  All were very clean and fresh with many layers to the flavor.  I would list them in this order from favorite to least favorite.  Spring Tart Smoked Pork Meatballs Winter Squash Salad Parmesan fries (fries were good but the ketchup tasted like marinara sauce and was very interesting) Duck \"Tacos\" (did not do much for me - just so-so and expected more after the above were so good)  We also shared two deserts: a pear something that was really good and a gingerbread that was VERY overpowering with ginger.  Not being a gingerbread fan this was too much for me but the others liked it.  Great staff and cool open kitchen in the back.  Also, gotta love the Chalkboard bathrooms!  Upscale and trendier (I hate to use this word but, Hipster'ish) than I have seen in the area.  Then again I have only had time to see a few places.  I would have loved to try lunch here (if they do lunch).  So if you want to support the \"eat local\" movement, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere , love the decor. Even though the restaurant wasn't busy, service was slow- sat with our finished plates for over half hour waiting for bill. The food was not up to standard. Had the fish tacos that were on special and they were dripping grease not only from the crepe wrap but also the deep fried fish. Side of fries were ok- but nothing to rave about. Very underwhelmed considering location and price- will not be returning"}
{"text":"Whenever I go eat at a place that serves asian food [which this place is not] I am overwhelmed by the choices of food. Most other restaurants as well. Their menu's are pages long and their descriptions reveal nothing that the obscure foreign language title didn't. Market, however, is rather different.   Their Menu has 9 Items. Two columns. And they make that food to such a high standard that I am inclined to go for every single business meeting there and neglect to check out Calgary's other eateries.   My friends all have heard me rave about this place, and the single dish that I make them all try upon first sitting here, is the Chicken Sandwich on the Mid-day menu. The thick, juicy, buttery flavoured, crispy piece of food-art that arrives is to die for. It has received my personal award for Best Sandwich in the World.   Now i've had my years on this planet, and i've eaten my share of sandwiches, but this takes the crown for being the best.   I have never been disappointed at anything at market. Plus they have a huge chalkboard in the washroom, which I have bestowed with my share of naughty drawings and clever quotes."}
{"text":"I love this place though I am kinds sour about the changing menu, they had these meatballs that were AMAZING... but they have been changed out for something else which I am sure is also delish. I love that everything is local, will keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice since returning to Calgary after 10 years away. Fabulous food and service both times! Love this place. Everything we have had (both food and drinks) has been excellent. Cannot say enough good things about this place! Go!! You will not regret it."}
{"text":"MARKET is a must if you love fresh, tasty food, and they have everything from lamb shank to potato skins, done with fine dining flair.   Their burger is the best burger I've had in YYC, or possibly ever. Simple, but done right. The romano gnocchi is as good or better than the gnocchi I ate in Italy. It's surprisingly light and fresh. If you're more adventurous, their duck tacos with gooseberry salsa are awesome!  The vibe is open and light, with cool white and black decor, but prepare for an open concept. It doesn't necessarily take away from the experience, its just something to consider depending on the occasion. I also like that you can see who cooks your food, especially when they look like the cooks at MARKET!  The bartenders are usually pretty good as well. They have some creative cocktails and are pretty accommodating.   Best restaurant in Calgary, definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Likes: -presentation of every dish was thoughtful -attentive wait staff. Knowledgable, friendly and not overbearing -ambiance, chalk artwork, the squid plates -wings. They must take forever to brine and cook to perfection like this. 24h? The home made hot sauce is flavourful and not too hot. I want the recipe.  Dislikes: -2 of the sodas we ordered (cola and lemon lime) weren't to our liking but that can be chalked up to personal taste. -the oysters were not on point and should have been left off completely. -Flavors lacking on the braised beef (my main). The sides were ok but the beef itself was not recommendable. This shouldn't happen in Calgary. -for the beet cheesecake it was hard to isolate the ingredients being used. it tasted like a regular cheesecake from a grocery store. The beet chips were a nice touch but not a saving grace.  After reading the menu and seeing what they are going for, I was really excited to try most of the appetizers. I'm glad we gave it a shot and it was a good birthday experience with the family, but I don't think I'll be returning to eat, because I personally didn't like the flavours I experienced. I really wanted to like it but if the wings were the taste highlight for me something is amiss."}
{"text":"Been to Market a few times now.  If it is a nice evening, try the cozy patio.  Every dish is expertly prepared and artistically presented.  A must for any foodie.  Several appetizers easily work as a main and definitely do not skip dessert.  The vibe is very cool and the service is excellent.  Highly recommend this little gem of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here while visiting Calgary. The food was incredible! I ordered the chicken and biscuits which were perfectly made, tender and flavourful. My friend ordered the gnocchi which was fresh and light, alongside the asparagus that was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The whole experience was great! Will definitely return on my next visit to Calgary!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, sweetbreads perfect!   Me wife and daughter love it here"}
{"text":"Had a chance to visit MARKET this weekend. Loved the whole white/black design where the bar area feels like a swank lounge and the white dining area has the feel of being invited into someone's kitchen for a home cooked meal. In the open kitchen, there is a giant fridge-like thing (but not a fridge) where they grow their own herbs & greens. Very cool. Food is local and very flavourful  - I had the bison tartare. Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and the service is even better!! My review is a little late but when we were meeting friends at Market for dinner, I had just found out I was pregnant, and wasn't telling anyone yet.  We got there first and had a chance to tell our server, Aaron that we were keeping this secret. He was beyond great, from making recommendations to subtly getting nonalcoholic beer and even blacking out the name on the bill so our friends didn't find out.   Beyond the attention to detail Aaron was extremely friendly and made our evening by treating us like old friends.  He is hands down the best server we've had in years!!   As I said, food is great but we will go back to Market because of the service."}
{"text":"Did a birthday dinner for 9 of us and the service was great!!  They had a new bartender so the drinks came out a bit slow but our waitress did everything she could to help get our drinks out.  She was awesome.  The food was outstanding! I had the butternut Squash soup and the chicken.  The soup had a bit of heat to it which I LOVED!! It was a perfect fall appetizer. The chicken dish was great too.  I did try to order the halibut first but it was sold out.  The juicy chicken dish came with spinach spätzle with mushrooms and sauce that was a perfect blend of flavours.  I will know for next time to go earlier so that things wouldn't be sold out.  I can tell you that I was still very satisfied with my 2nd choice."}
{"text":"Walked in on Sunday late afternoon hoping for a tasty meal. What we got instead was a waiter who disappeared often and a hostess who hovered and made awkward conversation, seemingly performing no other duties. Their prices are high, and I was not impressed with the menu or the flavor combos. They have sodas made in house, also disappointing. The most redeeming details of our meal at Market were my husband's beer (made elsewhere) and the outdoor patio. I made a huge mistake."}
{"text":"This was one big pleasant surprise. Not great street appeal but fantastic food. Had a great bottle of wine and service by Kat terrific."}
{"text":"I have been to Market several times in the past year. The most wonderful experience to date was on NYE 2014. Along with the 5 course meal we had offers of wine pairings and a wonderful introduction to each course by Chef Bohati! The evening was relaxing yet at the same time charged with excitement as each course was served. My celiac gluten free needs were easily and tastefully addressed by email confirmation so I could completely relax and enjoy. My sister still speaks about the boar belly and scallops. I cannot describe how much I loved the foie gras course. I need to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Sum up the food in one word - \"fun\"  We opted to share a bunch of the appetizers instead of ordering mains. All were interesting takes on traditional dishes - chicken wings, potato skins, tacos. All were very tasty and original.  Favourites were the dips plate (awesome mushroom tapenade on house made bread), duck tacos (really savoury crepes), and the broccoli.  Market also serves their own sodas. I tried the ginger ale, which was really ginger and citrus-flavoured soda water plus some sugar. The combination certainly worked.  The service was enthusiastic and the casual atmosphere gives the place a comfortable feel.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this resto is cool with a modern appeal and an open kitchen. Recommended for date night the food is pretty good, but its the atmosphere and the decor of the resto that made me like it more."}
{"text":"The hype about this farm-to-table restaurant is totally overrated.  Food was just decent."}
{"text":"Really tasty selection for lunch menu. Went here during lunch hour but service was not fast enough but food is worth the wait. Calgary needs more local fresh food places like this."}
{"text":"It was an interesting experience to say the least at Market. It was my first time for dinner last night, for a friend's birthday dinner, and her first time as well.  The first sign of something wrong, 3 of us ordered the smoked pork belly, to be told 5 minutes after placing our order that they were out.. Booh!   Secondly, my 2nd choice meal had to be remade for some reason, I ate 8-10 minutes after all my dinner companions had received and half finished their meals. 2nd Booh!  There was no manager apology or explanation. Just a lame server apology, and we weren't even sure if I was to be comp'd my order, for the terrible experience, until the bill arrived at the end. 3rd Booh!  The food was only 50/50 Some tasty original food ideas, but the 5 of us foodies found it to be all over the place in terms of flavour and consistency.  The steak tartare was bland and needed salt or something, the risotto was a tad over cooked with too many ideas competing for your palate, the mushroom toast was yummy, but ridiculous as a share, it gets soggy and hard to cut. The duck tacos were amazing( thankfully) but the Beet Salad was only good but not outstanding.  I had the chicken. Yummy flavours and perfectly cooked barley, when it eventually arrived. However, the chicken had a strange dense compressed texture that reminded me of ham half-way through eating it.  My friends steak was perfectly cooked, but I found her potato side unbearably salty .  Dessert was good, but at this point the whole experience was just a lets get through this-- kind of feeling.  So 1 star off for each Booh, and out of the 2 stars left, only a 50/50 on food quality.  I appreciate the concept and expense that goes into creating local sustainable food, but for 1000$ for food, prosecco, drinks and dessert for 5-- the experience left me and all of us disappointed for a first visit. I probably won't return, and I won't recommend this place based on inconsistent-sometimes-bland food and service."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere were great. The food was okay, but it didn't live up to our expectations. The sausage wrapped pork was very tasty. However, my boyfriend had the chicken - it was very salty and underwhelming, like something you made at home that didn't quite turn out.   Drinks were good, but the food needs to step up. There are so many great options nearby -- I want consistently good food when I dine out."}
{"text":"A fellow Yelp foodie and I decided to join Market for their hip hop brunch. Really, who doesn't love a little Tupac, Biggie or Dr Dre on a Sunday morning?  We thought we'd take advantage of the nice day and sit outside. Probably a mistake on our end. It was HOT. Like sweating into your seat hot and no amount of water could cool you down hot. And we were seated by the pit where they were roasting a (delicious) pig for their evening's AYCE BBQ (which we sadly had to miss out on) so there was that added heat and ashes flying into us when there was an occasional breeze.    I went with the \"Rolling with my Gnocchi's\" after consulting with our server if it'd be filling, given that it was on the small stage section of the menu and it was $18. When it finally arrived, there was a look of disappointment on my face. Although aesthetically pleasing with the micro greens, bacon lardons and truffle cream sauce, the portion was TINY.   So, still hungry, burning and sweating from the sun we settled the bill and left as quickly as we could.  With a prime location on 17th, people are going to want to sit on the patio! Maybe to make people's experience a little more enjoyable, Market should invest in some patio umbrellas."}
{"text":"Interior decos were a bit much for me, so opted for the patio. The cushions were still damp from rain despite the server reassuring us otherwise. BUT the pork belly sandwich was the tits. And they grow their own microgreens, which is kinda cool."}
{"text":"The Good: This restaurant is beautiful. It is a hipster's paradise. I ate on he lovely outdoor patio, which was filled with the scent of a vase of fresh lilies. The menu sounded inventive, and included an array of ingredients that sounded very flavorful, and the food seemed very fresh. The servers were friendly.  The Bad: While very fresh and served beautifully, the food was only okay. It was not flavorful-- which is hard to imagine given the ingredients. I had a chef's special pasta with olive oil, white wine, mushrooms, chicken, Parmesan, and BACON. But no flavor! How is that possible??  I don't think there was any salt in it... Same with the fried Brussels sprouts-- they were sweetened somehow, but the savory and salty elements were lacking. And, the food was a little pricey.  All in all-- I really wanted to love it, but couldn't."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow wow wow. 17 ave in Calgary is a mix bag of restaurants clothing stores and coffee shops. It reminds me of so many different main drags in so many other cities but yet it has it's own flavour.  I sat at the bar like I do. The two bartenders made bar standard drinks and cocktails with style and grace. It was a pleasure to watch Reese make a Mojito. I started my dinner with Sweet Potato Prawns then the West Coast Pacific Wild Salmon cooked to perfection. I feel like I'm at a loss for words when it comes to this restaurant.  The Decore was great the staff was great the food was amazing this would be a great place for all White dress party.   I was not recommended to this restaurant I drove by saw the vibe and felt the need to go in and eat here. This does not happen often to me. I know even though my review is vague of this great restaurant. I do know a couple things about it. The owner is a young 26-year-old decided that she wanted to open a restaurant with good food. This you did incredibly well. The restaurant was definitely not overstaffed or understaffed. I watched every meal come out of the kitchen going OMG. WATCHING ALL THE OTHER PATRONS EAT, YOU COULD TELL THAT THEY WERE HAVING A FOOD ORGASM !!!  I really don't remember the last time when I had such a great meal of a place I found on my own. So way to go Calgary way to go this is the best restaurant for the price that I found to date. I had three course meal, two drinks with it and my bill was $70.00 plus a $30.00 tip.  I would've paid more. So if you're from Calgary or if you're not I highly suggest this restaurant called Market.   Finally a restaurant that can even shut me up. There we have it that's the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth so help me. Wow I look forward to her next restaurant. I wish you were open for breakfast :-)"}
{"text":"Oh boy this food is amazing I had the burger and it was so fresh and perfect portion sizes. I love the atmosphere it's nice and quite and the lights are beautiful. The bar has so many drink options and what I love is the fact they made the pop in house so it's fresh and I have never had anything like it. The fries were crispy and the salad was so yummy. The average cost per plate is around 30$ and drinks are around 6$ or more depending what you get. The only bad thing is parking it's awful since 17th is backed up under construction it's hard to get to. I will be back but not until construction  clears up."}
{"text":"Focused on the popular farm-to-table philosophy, MARKET offers up some quality food showcasing the best that local producers have to offer. It's remarkable how blessed we are to be in such a place where we can enjoy such fresh and delicious product right here in our backyard, and when it's handled with care and precision to make it shine, there's no wonder why MARKET is such a busy place.  I had waited a long time to finally visit MARKET. Not wanting to get caught up in the hype of a newly opened eatery, I didn't want the surrounding buzz to hinder a good, honest perception of the food here. What I did see here was a lot of cleanly executed, healthy, vibrant and colourful dishes elevating the local ingredients based on their own merits. It's not a magic show here, folks, it's just really good food.  Among all the items on the simple, ever-changing menu I chose the most unassuming; The MARKET burger. Take a brisket and shortrib blend, grind it in-house and granulate the patty. In case you're not familiar with the technique, the meat is brought from the grinder very carefully as to line up all the grain in the same direction. The patties are made by slicing them from a large meat cylinder. As a result, you get this extremely tender burger that yields to your bite. It's incredible. Add to that, a house-made beer cheese, roasted tomato jam and a tender shortrib ragout. Put it in a pillowy brioche and call your momma. This is a hell of a good experience.  The burger is served with house-made potato chips, which in my mind, fares better than the traditional fries. They're lighter and complement such a rich burger very nicely. Wash the whole thing down with a Village wheat and you have yourself a kickass superteam, like the Superfriends...except without the Wondertwins.  If you want to enjoy an evening of drinking and dining here, bring money. This place is a little on the pricey side. 2 beers and 2 burgers ran us just over $60. Is it worth it? Yes, but at the same time, I can't see myself going there more than once a month."}
{"text":"Although the name makes it hard to find, this restaurant is a little gem.  It was one of several stops on a poutine crawl during Poutine Week and they were serving up a really delicious variation.  The Market poutine was Carbonara with a black pepper bechamel sauce, peas, pancetta, curds, pea tendrils, parmesan and sous-vide eggs.  I left the eggs to Derek and the others at the table as I can't stand the texture of eggs that aren't \"cooked to death\" as he calls them.  The fries were crispy and well seasoned while the cheese was gooey and perfectly melted.  The sauce was light and balanced the saltiness of the parmesan.  The real treat of the poutine was the peas.  They were fresh, the pea tendrils were delicious, and honestly they were the best part.  Fresh peas that tasted like they'd been pulled right off the vine can't really be beat.  Without the egg it had to be one of the best poutines I had the whole evening.  The drink list looked a tad expensive, but I'd enjoy a trip back to this place to try the regular menu for sure!  On a side note - the live music was amazing, it was great for background but not enough to overpower conversation.  The musician that night was playing some really amazing variations of songs that I hadn't heard before.  The chalkboard walls were cool too...they leave chalk lying around for you to draw on them and that's just fun."}
{"text":"Overall a hit, and a couple misses.  As my table of 7 next to the kitchen waited for our entrees the kitchen gave us a grilled cheese dish with poached egg. It was SO good! Best egg of my life in fact - looked like it was cooked in a sous vide.   We started with the cheese platter, which was ok. We liked the crispy fried cheese, but I could get better goat cheese and brioche from a mediocre buffet. Then the entree - pheasant with blood orange sausage. Everything was too salty and the sausage was falling apart in a weird mushy way like it wasn't cooked... I had no desire to eat it...   On a positive note, the decor and the presentation were exquisite... so go for a drink or two, but skip the entree."}
{"text":"Stopped into Market to partake of their YYC Taco Fest entry. Didn't realise that the tacos they had on offer are also on their regular menu. Bonus for that. Were really busy so we sat at the bar.   Potions are 4 tacos - with a choice of 2 meats. That way you get 2 tacos of each in an order. We decide to share an order of pork and duck. Kitchen and restaurant were super busy that day and when the order came we had 4 pork tacos. Let the waitress know we were missing the duck tacos. She went to immediately get us 2 duck tacos and told us to start on the 4 pork ones we had.   Where they shone is what happened without us. The waitress let the bar tender know what had happened and she told the kitchen. Bartender came to us to let us know he was aware of the issue and had also check that the kitchen knew what was going on. The manager brought our 2 duck tacos to us very quickly after that and made sure everything was good. Now I know this is how it should be, but you are often left wondering if everyone that needed to know about an error was told - this was absolutely the case. Very impressed.  And in case you were wondering, the duck tacos were a clear winner. Eat them all."}
{"text":"With the wide array of choices on 17th Avenue, it can get daunting for an indecisive person to pick a restaurant for dinner. Some nights you just need a friend to pick a restaurant and make that decision for me! MARKET ended up as that choice!  The first thing you notice is the beautiful and unique decor in the restaurant. Contrasting black and white seems to be the theme for the space, with accent pieces all over. A very trendy and modern look! We decided to sit in the patio as the weather was quite nice, but the area was quite crowded with a many tables trying to cram into a relatively small patio space. The tables all seemed to be wobbly, which made things more challenging throughout the night with plates and drinks.   Order a couple cocktails and quite enjoyed them. Always live a good Pimm's! The Pork Belly Potato Skins were absolutely delightful, with a beautiful plating and unique combination of tastes.  I got the steak which the overall plate was quite good, except for the part where the meat was quite tough to chew and get through. The sides that came along and the marinate was delightful, but the overall experience of the steak was ruined by the toughness of the meat. The dish was also served with the steak already cut into pieces, which is not something I would usually expect when ordering a steak. Just give me my big chunk of meat and let me carve into it myself!   Overall, a good experience that could be enhanced with a few changes. I did like the service as the server and manager did come to check up on us without being too bothersome, and they would explain anything that came to your table in full detail!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a lunch spot around the 17th Ave area, and after reading some reviews, decided to check out this restaurant for local seasonal cuisine.  Expectations were high since Market was named best restaurant in 2015, 2016 and third best in 2017!  Atmosphere: 4/5  It was a really hot day, so it was great to finally get indoors!  It was not too busy in the restaurant and had a nice, casual relaxed feel.  I like the decor including the chalkboard drawings and black on white.  Market also has a nice patio but it was too sunny and hot that day to enjoy.  Food: 3.5/5  Since it was a weekend, we had the brunch menu available.  I ended up getting the Market breakfast with sausages, bacon, 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, curd tots and fruit.  It was quite a bit of food!  The tots were good; otherwise I thought the remainder of the meal was as expected for breakfast and did not quite live up to the hype.  I would've also enjoyed something a little less oily or deep fried.    Service: 4/5  Very attentive server and friendly  Price: 3/5  Slightly high for the amount and type of food  Overall: 3.5/5  Overall, I had higher expectations for this restaurant since it had won so many awards!  I enjoyed my breakfast in this casual atmosphere, but maybe was expecting something a little more unique to the restaurant... perhaps I would pick something more specific to the restaurant next time.  The price was also higher than expected.  Otherwise, good service and at least interesting to try for a quick brunch!"}
{"text":"#115 Lunch on a Sunday during the BIG Taste of Calgary.   $25 gets you the following choices:  1st course:  Winter vegetable soup or kale Caesar salad (my choice today and appeared very fresh with bacon and parmesan crisps as mentioned in other reviews)  2nd course:  Bison burger or fried chicken sandwich (my choice today and the chicken was perfectly breaded and tender, coming with fries or chips with what appeared to be a homemade ketchup) or quiche  3rd course:  Apple turnover  Two mixed drinks:  Pencillin (2oz) for $16 Chocolate Orange Manhattan (2oz) for $12  Bright and light decor feels very inviting. Lots of tables of various sizes so groups will love this. Not good for kids but some person brought theirs. There are 3 TV's but they were not on today. The music plays in the background as it should and is not a hindrance to the conversation. The open kitchen is very nice as are the hanging planters above the bar.  The service was really good today as the hostess seats you rather quickly and follows up on drinks and such.  The menu is a little pricey for sure. That may change as more restaurants of this type open up. This is definitely a good once or twice a month spot.  The clientèle ranges from working class to the seemingly well-to-do so there is a little air of attitude floating around.  Luckily, I did not experience any of the other problems with service that other reviewers seem to have had. That being said, most of those seem to be in the evening hours.  From experience, farmers are not evening people so stick to lunch/brunch."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I just don't.   The pros: Infinitely better than the Yardhouse The food is very tasty  The cons: Inexperienced and just plain bad waitstaff Portions are tiny Prices are large  This place feels like a Model Milk wannabe; it's a shame. Maybe they'll figure it out once they get rolling but they're not off to a good start."}
{"text":"Really cute place to have your Friday night out. Food was nice, smaller portion but you won't be hungry afterwards. A little pricy but not too bad. Really enjoyed the place and will come back again"}
{"text":"Arrived for our table on the patio as previously requested when we made our reservation with our party of 8. What a beautiful day for the patio! However there isn't really any barrier from the street to our table and unfortunately several times that evening there would be homeless that would come and literally lean over the ledge and bother our dining party... Took away a bit from our dining experience. Some patios have a bit of a separation or a little higher of a barrier between the street and the patio.  Ordered the pork belly and shellfish for two platter to share with my girlfriend - it was amazing! Presentation was spectacular, food was so flavorful and well balanced. 5/5 for what we ordered!   That being said, my friend ordered a steak and requested it to be medium rare. Unfortunately the $30+ dollar steak came pretty much well done...It also came pre-sliced which I'm never a fan of. When its pre-sliced prior to serving you can see rareness of the steak so there was not excuse that you didn't know it was well done! (I'd give you the benefit of the doubt if you couldn't see inside and well-done was served when medium rare was ordered.) So the server offered to replace the dish which was appreciated - but she only offered to replace the steak! I think her intentions were good, she said \"Oh you must be hungry I'll leave the sides here for you so you can eat that for now.\" But really, am I going to eat all the sides and then just eat the steak on its own after? I don't know about you who is reading this but most people enjoy a bit of the steak, have some sides, and so forth. I'd offer to take the whole thing back and replace it or leave the old dish of sides and give my friend a new plate of everything.  Service was pretty prompt and friendly asides from that incident so no more complaints here about that. If the steak hadn't came out wrong and was handled better, I would of rated this place 5/5, but just missed the mark."}
{"text":"Food is good, the red wine however was served warm 72 degrees they should keep their wine cellar cooler. Desert was a chocolate cake a bit anticlimactic. Server asked if we enjoyed it though and removed it from the bill. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant meal in a very long time.  We came here to celebrate my daughter's birthday. We had a 7:45 reservation and were promptly seated at the appointed time.  The menu, which is essentially piece of paper attached to a chunk of wood, is not very extensive, but manages to cover several different groups of proteins in its half dozen entree offerings plus the one entree special.    We started off with the yam beignets off the regular menu and the lamb neck peirogies from the days specials. I am sure that if Shakespeare were alive he would have written a sonnet about the beignets! Some beignet with a little goat cheese and jalapeno aioli was the perfect, melt in the mouth bite.  I ordered the chicken breast for my main. Nice and moist with a crispy skin, yum!  The steel - cut oatmeal risotto provided the well seasoned complement to the chicken.  My dinner companions had ordered pork and steak and were as equally enamoured with their dishes.   For dessert we shared a plate of their homemade doughnuts. These were the perfect sweet bite to finish our meal, and to our delight, they were comped on our bill as a gift to the birthday girl.   The next time I am in Calgary I will be certain to have a meal at Market."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for our first date almost two years ago and we make a point of going there for our more fancy date nights. Is it expensive? Yes. Is it fabulous? Hell yes. On our first date we ordered the duck tacos and a couple other appetizers. The tacos were so good that I forgot all about the fact that I was on a first date and went to town on those tacos! When it finally dawned on me I realized that I was totally stuffing my face in the most unladylike fashion. I looked up and he was gazing at me. I made a comment about the food stuck in my teeth (jokingly) and he looked me right in the eye with a cute smirk and said \"that's not what I was looking at, you have really beautiful eyes\". .....tehe. Anyway, I always enjoy myself there. The service is excellent and the staff are great at making recommendations if you have trouble deciding. The atmosphere is beautiful and modern. The hipster in you will love this place. Soon it will be our two year anniversary and yes, we will be going to MARKET."}
{"text":"Went here on a sunny Sunday for lunch with my best friend. We sat on the patio and had a couple of drinks (specialty of the day from the bartender) and a light lunch. It was fantastic. Everything on the menu sounded great and our particular meals were delicious. The server was attentive and cheerful and our dishes came out in the appropriate amount of time. My favourite part of the patio was the planters all along the railing. They really have the sense that this restaurant want to make real, good, wholesome food. The only downside was that I thought it was a bit pricy for the casual atmosphere, but I would still definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been trying to get to Market for ages and Big Taste YYC 2017 was a good time to do it. I had a quick hour between opera rehearsals so made a reservation and booted it there. I told the waitress as she was seating me that I only had 40 mins at best for lunch and she assured me that it would be no problem. Service was excellent and the server even offered up a suggestion that instead of the rice pudding that was on the menu that they would be happy to substitute it for house made cookies as they were more portable. I opted for the salad, fried chicken sandwich and rice pudding that was on the Big Taste Menu. What I love about the chef here is not just the flavours of the food but texture. I think texture is sometimes neglected by chefs and yet it can enhance a dish and just bring up a notch. The salad had a flavourful dressing but was topped by the crunch of almonds, it was a mix of fresh greens, a bit of crumbled feta and dried cranberries and almonds but it was one of the best salads I've had. The fried chicken was crunchy and crisp and the chicken moist. I took half my sandwich to go so that I would have time to enjoy the rice pudding and the chicken was still crunchy when I had the rest of my sandwich for an afternoon snack. The rice pudding was served a little too hot as the ice cream on the top melted before I was even halfway through but I liked that it wasn't too sweet. It could have been a little creamier and was a little too dry but tasty. Market offers a 3-course lunch for $25 on a regular basis so you don't have to wait for an event like Big Taste to get a great deal. It's on 17 Ave S.W. so it's street parking and with construction going on along 17th Ave it might just be a little difficult to find parking."}
{"text":"So let me say that this is a brand new restaurant and having been a part of more then 4 openings myself I have learned that there are always kinks to workout once open. That being said here is my honest feedback. Hopefully the talented people at MARKET take it into consideration.   My date and I went this past Monday, the place was really quiet as it was 8:45pm. We were greeted at the door and sat right away with our reso. The server came over and took a drink order. We didn't feel like drinking that night so we went with the in house made sodas. I had the rootbeer and she had the ginger ale. The rootbeer was alright, a bit watery but the ginger ale was not pleasant so we switched it out for the cola which was better. For food we ordered the bison tartar and the foie. We both love these dishes at Teatro, Cucina, Anju etc. but found the texture contrasts to be unsettling. The flavours were great but when the textures were paired together it left us not to eager to go back. For example, the bison, which was very nice, had strips of jerky as a garnish. This just created the feeling of dried out bison bits rather then truly setting the two ingredients apart. Had the jerky, and the wheat grass been left off I feel this dish would be much better. The Foie itself was outstanding, nice work on that one, yet the beet reduction (I think) had a very fruit roll up like texture causing the melt in your mouth liver to become tacky. I think a few drops of the beet, in the form of a compote, would better pair with this dish. Just my thoughts.   The mushroom gnocchi we had was really nice, using a poached egg as the sauce. My date felt it was too salty but I enjoyed it.   As for the restaurant design, the womens washroom was out of order that night so I had to stand guard at the mens door while my date went to the washroom. The black side of the restaurant looked good as the kitchen looked awesome, I was not a fan of the white side, too sterile looking.   My favourite part was the music, loved it. That being said if they work on the textures of these dishes and bring the price down a little I think they have a good chance of being a focal point of 17th ave. If they don't I am not sure I will be a regular, which is too bad because if you go you will see, and taste, the promise this team shows, they just need to tweak it here and there."}
{"text":"I attended a private function here last night and it was the best location I could think of to have held this event which was a graduation party.  There specialty drinks are absolutely amazing especially the one called the Sally Anne or the Sally Anna.  In addition to this- I have never had highballs like I have here! There high balls are all made with sodas that they make in house. I would have vodka with their house made gingerale, vodka with their house made limeade, vodka with their house made cola and vodka with their home made cream soda.  Their gingerly is AMAZING! and actually tastes like ginger rather than the bottled stuff and they even put a slice of fresh ginger in it!  There Cola tastes like it has cinnamon in it which was amazing! Almost like non-alcoholic fireball.  As well, the appetizers that they were feeding us were amazing! We had delicious poutine, wings and pulled pork tacos!  AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I came here to try their three course lunch and I went with the smoked brisket burger. The sauce in the burger was delicious but the brisket itself was quite dry. It was also quite a large piece so it posed a bit of a challenge to eat while trying to enjoy the other components of the burger. My friends and I started off with their beef tartare and that was amazing! I would still come back and try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"We were there for a special event where the restaurant was closed for a wedding I was attending.  The good: Great understanding staff that let us decorate the place the Saturday evening before. Also a lot of help from them. The service was good and food terrific. Manager went out of her way to accommodate us. Bathroom chalkboard walls let's you use chalk to write on them (cool).   The bad: bartenders cannot calculate change right. They cannot serve a decent rum and coke. Parking is limited.  Our experience there was great and the awesome staff made this wedding extra special. Big thanks to Market!"}
{"text":"The chicken confiet  was only done for 10 hours.  A process that takes days.  Bare minimum.  My chicken came plated to the side, very unappetizing.  Avoid this place, I'll never be back"}
{"text":"Hipsters rejoice!  Yet another super trendy, farm-to-table, 17th ave hot spot filled with bearded patrons using the WiFi to update their blogs (I sound like a hater, but I'm drawn to these spots like a moth to a magnet, or whatever).  Had lunch with a friend today and sizzled in the glorious sunshine coming in from the open windows.  I chowed down on the kale salad, which was perfect for lunch - a springy bed of kale with double-smoked BACON and weird but awesome Parmesan crisps.  The highlight, though, was undoubtedly the egg on top - the blood orange yolk was cooked to runny perfection and acted as a dressing, as did my tears of joy at the pure masterpiece in front of me.   I also had a Caesar, which was kind of meh.  It tasted a bit watered down, almost in the way that the massively inferior Bloody Mary does when you have the tremendous misfortune of accidentally ordering a Caesar in the states and getting that instead.  Disappointment is what I'm getting at, folks.  The cocktail menu looked dynamite, though; wish I had ordered something from that instead.  This place is worth going to for the patio alone, but the bacon and the beards sure are perks!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent dinner at Market! We had the crab corndogs to start and they were AMAZING! I would go back just for those. I also really enjoyed a refreshing cucumber collins cocktail. For dinner, we shared the chef's daily inspiration platter for two. It was ribs, chicken, pork, mashed potatoes, green beans, and a side salad. The ribs and chicken were incredible but the pork was a bit overcooked. Overall we had a wonderful meal on the patio and the service was great. The platter for two is also a super deal on Thursdays because it's a lot of food for only $40."}
{"text":"Took my mother here for her birthday supper, overall a pleasant experience. A good place for adventurous eaters with a variety of entrees (bison, duck, lamb etc.). It is more expensive - so for me, it would be a more special occasions restaurant. The atmosphere is very nice and service was excellent - very friendly and attentive.  Overall, a more unique dining experience, a little more pricey but a good choice for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"We had a table of 12 for a birthday celebration. Oysters were delicious for the entire table to share. I had a bone in pork chop special with scallops, cauliflower and yams. The meal definitely exceeded my expectations and was superb. Everyone agreed that this place was severely underrated on urban spoon and Yelp. We will be adding this to our favourites list along with Model Milk, Taste, Ox and Angela etc."}
{"text":"I love Market, great location on 17th ave with a bright and open interior with a variety of seating from bar style tops, bench type seating over looking 17th ave and patio seats. This time we stopped by for a visit on Friday night and although there weren't many seats filled at the time they were almost totally booked with reservations and the restaurant was packed by the time we left. Our server was friendly and the perfect level of attentive. I also really appreciate that sparkling water is complimentary here, I can never get enough soda water....mmmm bubbles.   We were just looking for a little bite and shared the market options turned into a platter, there was a large bowl of veggie chips, chorizo poppers (fancy sausage rolls) and shrimp cocktail with homemade cocktail sauce, it was all delicious and satisfying and the two of us were really happy with the portion size."}
{"text":"This place without a doubt has the best meal I've ever consumed in the entirety of my life.   I had the 3 course meal for $25 including a fresh market salad, fried chicken sandwich which had things like fresh pesto, homemade garlic aioli and juicy chicken, and a moist carrot cake with cream cheese icing. I am not joking when I say it is literally the best meal I've had. All of the ingredients at this restaurant were fresh and local and it really made the difference! Along with the meal, I had the market iced tea which is also made on site and it is so so good!  Cannot say enough about this place. If you ever have a chance to make it to this hidden secret, or even if you don't, make time and eat delicious food!!!"}
{"text":"I have only been to Market once and I think I'm in love .  I loved everything about the decor and vibe of Market.  I loved that the front entrance has local handcrafted chocolates and sauces for sale. I loved the way the restaurant was divided into a white and a black side. The contrast was modern and created a day and night feel. I loved the bathroom and the way they used chalk paint on the stalls so people could leave messages in chalk. I loved the cozy patio, which was quaint and had fresh tomato plants growing along the divider. The walls provided just enough privacy for diners to enjoy their meal but still be able to feel like they are part of the 17th Ave social scene.   We had dinner on a Wednesday night with my niece on the patio. I mention my niece because despite the fact that Market doesn't have high chairs they still did their best to make our experience kid friendly. The special that day was $2 oysters all day so we ordered some and they were tasty. They came with a house horseradish, vinaigrette and hot sauce. Aside from oysters, we ordered the popcorn, halibut, duck, gnocchi and pork chops. Everything was amazing and my niece especially loved the gnocchi.   Like I said at the beginning, this was my first time at Market and I loved it. I would definitely choose Market as one of my new go to places for a dinner, a date or for summer night patio drinks with friends.   P.s the handmade chocolates were also delicious. We got a assorted half dozen to go and they did not disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is a 17th Ave gem! I love sitting on the patio in the summer and the fact that their herbs are actually grown on the patio. There is so much passion behind this restaurant and it's shown in the quality of the food and the drinks. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Oh Market. I had such high hopes for a $$$ joint. Beautiful, hip restaurant with a cute patio, I really wanted to love it. However, we had some issues as soon as we walked in the door.   We probably waited a solid 5 minutes standing at the door before we were even noticed, and the trend continued throughout the evening with a lack of presence from the waitstaff, keeping in mind that the restaurant wasn't more than half full.  That could have been forgiven had the food been amazing, but the highlight of the food was a complete and utter lack of flavor whatsoever.   We opted for the Meal for 2 to share, which in this case was a salad and a pasta dish. The Pork belly on the salad was absolutely delicious - packed full of flavour, tender, and juicy. The fried chicken on the salad was okay as well - nothing to write home about but definitely decent. Unfortunately that's where the flavour ends, abruptly and completely.   The pasta had halibut in it, and some parm shavings, but honestly nothing else. It was the blandest dish I'd ever tasted past sampling cooking pasta to check for doneness. There was absolutely no flavour, no sauce, no juices, no oil, barely any spices.   It was probably one of the worst pasta dishes I've ever had at a restaurant - and come on, pasta is so hard to screw up. for the price point ($$$), one would expect great food, or at minimum decent food. That pasta dish completely ruined the meal for us. I would not return to Market."}
{"text":"Great place - all foods are local from Alberta. We especially liked the duck appetizer and the lamb for the main course."}
{"text":"5 stars for MARKET.  The food has the wow factor.  Everything else is well done:  nice chic interior, good service, etc., but some of the dishes were among the best I've had in a long long time.  To wit: the pork salad.  It's a kale salad with several variations of pork (bacon, pork shoulder, etc.) to make up for the healthiness of the kale. I thought the bison tartare was also a stand-out.    We shared several small plates and the mushroom gnocci main- all really excellent.  It's loud, busy, and the tables are pretty much on top of one another so it's not a great place for quiet conversation or a first date.  But the food lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Sister came from Vancouver to visit me. Yes I was excited and I did some homework on where to bring her for dinner etc. So I googled and found Market Calgary. Food rating very high and I have to say I was not lied to.  I came here on Thanksgiving Sunday (No turkey for me). To my surprise not too many people (because everyone having turkey at home). I made a reservation on the day and usually you need at least couple days in advance. So we walked in and the whole night there were only 3 tables. Our server told us that their brussels spout are really popular here. I read the menu carefully and at the very far bottom corner right. There is a dinner platter chef special for 2 for $55. I had to ask what that was. I was told it was beef tenderloin with mashpotatoes, comes with a salad and brussel spout. I thought I heard it wrong. Too good to be true. So I asked if its Alberta beef. Server said yes. OMG..... This is such a good deal. I was amazed. Well I wanted my sister to have Alberta beef in cow town. Yes I got that.  The platter came with 2 piece beef tenderloin. It was delicious. Mash potatoes very buttery and fluffy nice. The brussel spouts were amazing. They were super delicious. Salad was ok. Food was amazing. We were very satisfied at the end.  Décor was nice. Kind of have that trendy, modern but not too classey feel to it.   Food did take awhile to come out but that is probably because of lack of staff working during Thanksgiving Sunday. Its a holiday so I can't expect too much on that part.  We also noticed that they have handmade chocolate. WOW interesting. I didn't pickup any chocolate.  Overall, very happy.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I wanted to be really really impressed!  But Market fell kinda short, and sent me home feeling a bit ripped off. like when your hot date wears a micro mini...and doesn't put out.   The food was very unimaginative. The descriptions on the menu sound awesome, and when it comes out you're like \"that's it?!\"   Especially the pork salad. Kale is kale, and  2 pieces of fried pork skin, the kind of you get 7-11 in a chip bag. And they also use that same pork skin in some of the other dishes.  Butternut squash soup comes out of a wine pour 4 ouncer glass. 4 ounces of wine is plenty, 4 ounces of butternut squash soup is petty. Fancy execution and mediocre product. I got the pork, which was ok but on the dry side. The beans and brussel spouts that came with it was straight steamed. Nothing really going on here. Actually, it was so plain it's lazy.  Milk & honey dessert was delicious, but I can't tell if I was just still hungry or if it was really that good.  Plus points for the awesome space that it is now, and the drinks were really good. Perhaps I'd come back for drinks and dessert, and I understand it is going through growing pains, maybe when the menu changes I would try it again. But i'm going to pass for now."}
{"text":"I really love this place. The decor is really interesting, the food is amazing and the service is excellent. It's a bit on the pricey side but they do have daily specials and a three course lunch for $25, between the specials and the prix fixe, it's in the same ballpark as the other restaurants in the area for higher quality food. Everything I've tried here has been delicious. So far, my favorite was the duck tacos. Try to save room for dessert because they're also really good!"}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I went here for dinner. We were greeted by a very nice man who seemed to really like that we were ok to wait at the bar for our table. We were greeted by a very nice bartender - so great that we decided to sit at the bar for dinner even though we had a table booked.  We enjoyed lots of wine and a couple cocktails with our dinner. We had two appetizers (dill pickle chicken wings and pulled pork potato sliders) and the steak main dish. We had them come out whenever it was ready and it was perfect. Great service from all the staff - I even got to taste some wine that I've never tried before I ordered my next glass. I thought it was very nice of them to do that.  I loved sitting at the bar because it gave us a front row view of the bartender making all the fantastic cocktails - seeing her make an old fashion really made me want that as my next drink! And then seeing her make the hibiscus drink with persecco automatically made me want that for dessert. Needless to say after multiple drinks and great plates of food we will be back."}
{"text":"Love the decor and the patio space.  Came here for yycburgerweek, but they were out of their burger week special :( So I ordered their market burger on the menu.  It is served medium (I think). Normally when you eat a medium burger it is juicy, I didnt' find it particularly juicy but it was still good.  and for $23... wow... pricey. and the chips on the side were burnt...."}
{"text":"Excellent food, had mushroom toast, and Duck it was excellent! Tried pasta and pork chops, excellent as well! Just hated not sitting at a table, was put at high table, and it was pretty loud! Also love their cola, amazing, but didn't like drink menu!!"}
{"text":"Great pork dish for two. Modern aesthetic, friendly service, creative menu. Worth it!"}
{"text":"Review: Wednesday night snack.  We came here during Poutine week and figured we'd try one of the contestants in the Gravy Bowl Challenge. I'm torn with this restaurant. We had an amazing dish but also subpar ones.  Bottomline: subpar service and featured food, but their mussels and fries dish was one of the best I've had.  Atmosphere: nice trendy open concept decor. It wasn't busy on a Wednesday night and we were seated right away.  Food: we had the Wednesday night special, which was the mussels and fries, their featured Lamb poutine, and their pastry chef's featured lava cake. Their mussels and fries dish was fantastic. Mussels were cooked perfectly and flavored beautifully. It wasn't the typical mussels dish where the tomato taste tend to overpower the mussels. Everything was balanced very well and you could taste the white wine in the sauce. The fries on the side came with truffle aioli that was truly heavenly. It was probably the best aioli I've ever had. Unfortunately, the rest of the meal was far below par. The featured Lamb poutine was not good. There wasn't enough cheese curds and it was so dry that we kept questioning whether they actually put the gravy in. We had the pastry chef special, which was a lava cake for that night. It came out in a plain tiny baking dish. There was no presentation, no garnish, no icing sugar, nothing to indicate that this was a restaurant dessert. It would have been nice if it was actually a lava cake, but they overcooked it and it honestly just tasted like a rich chocolate 2 bite brownie. For 9 dollars, this was a complete fail.  Value: the Wednesday special on the mussels and fries for 14 dollars is awesome! Definitely would come back for that. A 9 dollar brownie? I'll pass.  Encore? Yes. But I will most definitely stick with their regular menu."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I enjoy the fact that the menu is constantly changing, and every dish I've tried has been absolutely delicious! I'd recommend this place to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Love their local options and amazing drinks! Their menu is easy to read and everything is guaranteed to surpass your expectations. I love all of their appetizers but make sure you try their bread platter if you go! Its all so amazing"}
{"text":"The food is not half bad. However the decor is simply pretentiously. Knock-off Eames chairs is a poor choice and a sure sign of lack of confidence in the food.   If the chairs are genuine Eames then they should sell them and hire even better chefs, or perhaps rent a bigger venue. Nobody sane should run a restaurant with that kind of budget for chairs."}
{"text":"One of my favourite new restaurants in 17th ave. The first time I dined here, I noticed the modern design and theme of the restaurant. Very sophisticated but at the same time casual, just a really great atmosphere. And they happened to have live music featuring the local singer Jocelyn Alice who took our experience in Market to a whole new level. And the food, just amazing!! I definitely recommend the Salt Roasted Beet Salad, The Market Burger, Pork Shnitzer and the Char Grilled Angus Steak. Great service and most ingredients were home grown/made and locally produced."}
{"text":"Walking down 17th ave on a sunny Sunday afternoon and was debating on getting Starbucks across the street or a nice drink, opted for booze and picked this cute little restaurants as the patio had one more table open and it was in the sun. Our server was a young blonde guy who was super nice and helpful. I had a glass of prosecco and my fiancé had a light beer. One thing I noticed was that the champagne glass had nice thin glass (expensive!) not those thick plastic feeling ones some restaurants have (geeze I am picky!). I wasn't hungry but my fiancé had the grilled ham and cheese sandwich which comes with tomato soup (see pics). It has an egg right in the middle of the sandwich that is poached/soft boiled (Some crazy cooking process the server explained to us where the egg is spun around and cooked at 63.8 degrees). He said it was delicious and he could taste the freshness in the ingredients. All the ingredients are local, the menu talks about that at the top.  The inside was really cute all white tables and chairs. Would definitely try this place again, hopefully for dinner one night."}
{"text":"I went here during burger week.  I'll start with the atmosphere.  The decor was pretty nice, not too upscale but also contemporary enough to make it look like it's worthy of fine dining.  The food quality was top notch.  Presentation was great.  Do not go here if you're vegetarian or if you don't like beef, pork or seafood.  Why?  Because that's really all they have as main courses.  I had the #YYCBurgerWeek burger which really was a glorified meatball sandwich.  I thought the Parmesan was a little too strong.  I also had the roasted carrots on the side which were quite delicious.  Their home made ketchup was really just tomato sauce with oregano.  Not really a fan.  I'd be willing to go back to try the regular menu."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I've been here about 5 times and I've always really enjoyed it. The way I would describe it is just good tasting food without any pretentiousness. The layout is nice, relaxed and spacious and the staff is friendly and professional.   I've had many different dishes here and they have all been delicious. They don't try to get too weird with their dishes with  odd ingredients and I think they just focus on the taste   This is a great go to spot for a nice meal (especially on date night)."}
{"text":"Excellent craft cocktails.  Amazing menu. Snacks starters, soups, salads, beef, bison, duck, lamb, fish. Ryan bartender absolutely outstanding.   Torn between duck confit poutin and the crab corn dogs. I've had both elsewhere, but was convinced by Ryan the corn dogs were the way to go. He was right. I would consider this a must-have here. Beautifully served in asian style take-out container with  of Japanese seaweed and Asia fish sauce. Flavor explosion.   Again torn between halibut or brick roasted chicken. Went with chicken. About a quarter chicken. Brick pressed with crispy  and natural jus. Accompanied by garlic and cranberry smoked risotto and pumpkin seed pesto roasted carrots. Excellent. I like the portion control at this restaurant. You can have a starter and entree and maybe have dessert and not feel glutinous.   That being said, i felt like dessert but they ran out of cheesecake, even after specifically asking if I needed be worried they'd run out. Fail.   Whatever. Overall great experience. Would love to come back in summer and sit on the large outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Had a lovely late afternoon lunch here on a Saturday. The restaurant stays open from lunch through to dinner time. It was nice to sit there an enjoy a quiet lunch with my friend after the lunch rush. I had a lovely tuna salad ($16) - BC Albacore tuna, poplar bluff potatoes, tomato, tarragon vinaigrette and quail eggs. The salad was beautifully presented and was perfectly dressed. Service was attentive but provided space when needed when we were chatting and we never felt rushed.   Really liked the decor inside but the patio looked even nicer though it was too cool that day to sit outside."}
{"text":"Good, would come back but not quite a 4 in my opinion.  Relaxing decor, sat at the bar so only comment on the staff would be the bartender (Colin) and some of the staff who brought out the food - 5 stars in that category.  Colin was very helpful with recommending food, and even offered up a birthday shot for the lady.  Entrees were a bit mixed, the pork chop was a 'chef favorite' but found it to be pretty mediocre - meat was a bit too fatty (and I like fat!) and the attempt at risotto was misguided as it was way too creamy and lacked a bit on flavor.  The braised beef, on the other hand, stood out.  The meat portion, temperature, and preparation was spot on and the accompanying mushrooms were tasty.  The Apple Tarte Tartin desert was very good, however would likely try something else if I came back.  All in all, I would recommend this place but would temper expectations."}
{"text":"3 stars atmosphere 3 stars service 5 stars food  I'm going to start off by complaining a bit: Having wandered by and seen the place, we were intrigued. We stopped in to ask about getting a table, and were told it's impossible on a Friday without a reservation. We checked out the reviews later (here and elsewhere) and decided we had to try it out.  A week later, my brother came through town - here was our opportunity. I called late afternoon on a Tuesday to make a reservation. No tables available until 9 o'clock - unless we wouldn't mind sitting in the bar. Then they could accommodate us at 7:15. No problem - we'd been in and seen the tall bar tables upfront by the windows. It was almost better.  But when we arrived, we weren't seated in the bar. We were seated AT the bar. Not really cool at all. If there's no table, say so outright, Market people.  That out of the way, the food was as good as it gets. Market deserves to be packed every night, and cuisine-wise, deserves every rave review they've received. Both the pork and shellfish (for two) and the Angus beef were perfection.   The craft beer selection is great, and the wine list, while limited, has a good selection for food pairing.  The decor is a bit sterile in that modernist way, but reasonably nice. The plastic bucket chairs don't look very comfortable, but given that we didn't actually get to sit in them, that's conjecture.  Service wasn't bad, but wasn't great either - though the bartender is a very personable guy, and kept our glasses full."}
