{"text":"I noticed this restaurant in a shopping center next to a bar I frequent and decided to try it, I'm glad I did!  Although they are only open for breakfast and lunch the food was great and prices are very reasonable. I also enjoyed having a cappuccino after my meal! I'll be back to try more items!"}
{"text":"Good  food and great service from family operated place.
Denver omelet was very good and at a decent price"}
{"text":"Finally was able to enjoy the food here at Cafe Padella. The owners are a lovely young husband and wife team with the most beautiful little boy. He has those blue eyes that would stop anyone. The concept that they present here is so cute and family friendly. The atmosphere is ambient with so much love and joy. The owners really put their heart and soul into this establishment. They want to share their love of cooking with everyone else. 

I ordered the Ruben with sour kraut on the side. As I sit and wait for my sandwich I can hear the other half of the team busy at work. The smells coming from the kitchen are so amazing. The Reuben was fantastic and it was served on rye bread with french fries on the side. The smells coming from the plate are intoxicating too. 

The lobby is very large and family friendly. The chairs are comfortable and the couple that owns the restaurant is so wonderful. They will come out and socialize with the customers and make you feel like old friends or family."}
{"text":"Cafe Padella has this wonderful homey and comfort feeling. This is definitely my new go to breakfast place. It's a nice change and break away from the chain breakfast restaurants. I highly recommend eating here I had the corn beef hash traditional benedict that dish gets 5 stars all the way around!!"}
{"text":"Finally! a place that I can go to every day... always feel at home... eat good food... relax... start my day the right way."}
