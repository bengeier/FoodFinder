{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service. The lobster chimichanga is one of my favorites. The restaurant used to be Casita del Lago but now it's under new ownership and thankfully for the better. Everything is noticeably different from the lighting (it used to be pretty dark) to the food to the amount of people working in there. It always felt like Casita del Lago was closed but Los Amigos feels alive and I'm glad for that."}
{"text":"This place has a new owner and is now called Casita del Lago.    This Mexican restaurant is a hidden gem now that it has a new owner.  The food is authentic and tasty.  The furnishings are modest, but don't be fooled.  The food is \"excellente\" and the portions are generous. They use fresh fish in the fish tacos and the chile verde is heavenly.  The prices are reasonable.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try only because I heard there have been changes. The restaurant does seem to have a brighter, happier feel to it. The lighting and decor have improved. The staff is super friendly and welcoming. That is an improvement. On to the food. The fresh avocado dip is a nice touch. The complimentary salsa is very good too. Chunky and cilantro rich. We ordered the fajita for two and I can only be a judge of that dish. While the quality was good the dish was loaded with green peppers and onions and hardly any chicken. So if you are going to call it \"chicken fajita\" it should have some chicken. I am not demanding a super sized dish only that they actually give you what you ordered, chicken fajita not green pepper/onion fajita. Frankly the guys were nice enough that I feel that I could have told them in person. In conclusion, decent but definite room for improvement if they want to stick around."}
{"text":"Rumor has it that this was a happening night spot back in the day. It converted to a restaurant a few years back. I gotta tell you. This place is great for TexMex in NE Ohio. I travel all over the US and this is a great spot."}
{"text":"The front entrance feels more like a back one and the chips don't appear at your table almost immediately like some places but that is actually a good thing.  Previous reviews talk about their quality, I agree but all you do is save the salsa for the meals, which were very good.  My wife had the chili verde, good flavor and tenderness.  My fish tacos in corn tortillas were as good as any I've had on the west side. The host is a robust and friendly guy and the side salsas are very fresh.   I'm sure we'll be back, it'll be worth the trouble of sneaking my own chips in."}
{"text":"Under old ownership I had a few bad encounters, the last straw was when there was plastic wrap IN my beans. One of the biggest problems I had with them was that my food was always microwaved(caught them 3 times), they tried to pass it off as fresh, but I'm not a moron. I was told this place was under new management so I decided to give it another shot, but sadly, the food was no better. I ordered the enchiladas, beef and chicken. The chicken looked raw in some places and the beef tasted like ground Wal-Mart sausage. I also asked if there were onions in my order, I was assured that there were not, however the chicken was loaded with choppped onion. Our food came out in just minutes with a scalding hot plate, but when I checked the center of my food(because of past problems), it was lukewarm(as if it had been microwaved). Other than the already listed problems...the food was just bad, even the tortilla tasted like it hadn't been cooked, oh, and they drowned it in sauce, so the entire order was soggy within moments. The interior is still pretty bad, things are still torn and falling apart. I will never eat here again, and if you value your health (raw meat) you won't either. I would like to add however that the staff was very friendly. There are 2 other Hispanic restaurants not to far, both are far better, the one in North Olmsted has the best food. Try that."}
{"text":"They make guacamole fresh right beside your table.  Margaritas tasty, staff was nice.  Food came quick and was freshly made.   This will be my new hangout for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This place is like a blast from the past. The booth was falling apart. Our meals all came out at different times. The cheese in our quesadilla and meals was queso-- not regular shredded cheese. Some of the chips were stale and there were a zillion flies running around touching our food. I have no idea how this place has good reviews."}
{"text":"Super friendly. The salsa and guacamole are delicious. My favorite is the chicken nachos and fajitas. Daily special and very family/child friendly."}
{"text":"Just got lunch there this afternoon. I heard it was under new ownership so I decided to give them a try. I'm sure glad I did. Hands down this was the best Mexican food I've had around this area. Between the food and service I'm giving this 5 stars. I spoke with the owner a little bit and he went out of his way to make sure everything was up to my standards as well as all my needs were met.   I got a taco and beef enchilada and they were both amazing. The food is definitely fresh and confirmed with the owner everything is made THAT day and does not sit over night. There is a noticeable difference between the other places and this place. At the end of my meal I had asked about any deserts and told him I loved Churros. While they were not on the menu yet he went back and made some and brought them out. They were amazing. While I am incredibly full right now typing this review and probably shouldn't have consumed as many calories as I did at lunch, I sure don't regret going there. I'll definitely be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Great food: the presentation of everything was amazing. Awesome staff: everyone was very welcoming and friendly.   Well priced:  two sodas, two meals and a jumbo margarita came to $34.   I enjoyed every second here."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I ordered takeout from here last night. We ordered a steak burrito aend ground beef enchilada combo, Chori Pollo, and Cocktail de Camerones (Mexican shrimp cocktail- its like a gazpacho with tomatoes, onions, cilantro, avocado, and of course, shrimp! I eat it with crushed tortilla chips on top, although some prefer it straight or with saltine crackers instead of corn chips). The combo dish was delicious, the beef enchilada had an amazing flavor from the spices in the ground beef, the rice was pretty good too, the beans were a little too bland and kind of runny like they were watered down a bit, but not too bad. The Chori Pollo was AWESOME and I probably would not have thought to order it, but it was a daily special and I did want to try something new. The Cocktail de Camerones were what I was looking forward to the most, its one of my favorite dishes that alot of Mexican places do not offer (not sure why). I have to be honest, it looked just like Las Cazuela's, but is lacking a bit in flavor. I added a little bit brown sugar which seemed to do the trick just fine, but I also was eating it at home, so would feel weird asking for sugar in the restaurant. All in all, everything was very satisfying, and I would love to go back to sample their extensive tequila selection, The pictures of their margaritas look so delish! We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Awesome fresh food in a very friendly atmosphere. Table side guacamole and gold margaritas are the bomb. Be sure to try the mango mousse pie too. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst Mexican place I have ever been to. Meals were cold and I was given someone else's order. The taco was soggy and nasty looking. I cannot believe I wasted $10 there. The food literally tasted like leftovers. The place itself was a little run-down. There was a corner where dirty dishes/garbage was placed. This is a legit review...I am eating PB & J instead."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd give a bad review to a Mexican restaurant, but here I am. My boyfriend and I visited this place on a Wednesday night because I was really really craving a margarita and some Mexican food (and also because I'm always craving tacos). As soon as we walked in, we were a little overwhelmed by the smell of what could only be described as wet rags. There was also only one other couple in the place, which maybe should have been a warning. We decided to stay, but I wished we hadn't.       We were first brought out chips and salsa, which I never thought could be done wrong. However, many of our chips were either stale or soggy. I had read about their guacamole that is made at your table, and I wanted to try it. We passed on it because we couldn't have eaten it with the chips w were given.       I then ordered a classic lime margarita that I had been craving. I found it to be pretty weak and way too sweet. It tasted like it was pretty much straight margarita mix. I was very disappointed.       Then came the food. They had a special on fajitas, and both my boyfriend and I took advantage. They looked and smelled so good, but tasted like straight salt. I couldn't believe how overwhelmingly salty they were. We each ate very little and took the rest home. Mine ended up going straight into the trash, not sure about his."}
{"text":"Not good. The first noticeable thing upon entering the restaurant is the smell of wet, dirty dish rags. We were sat immediately, but it was a Wednesday evening so they weren't busy.   We were brought a basket of chips and a dish of salsa, but the chips were cold, seemingly stale, and half of them were literally wet and soggy. Off to a terrible start. I couldn't even stomach the chips.   My friend got a lime margarita and said it was very weak. She had been craving one all day, so she was disappointed when it wasn't strong enough. Also asked for not salt on the rim and the glass came with salt.   We both ordered the chicken fajita. It was the single saltiest thing I've ever tasted. Whatever flavor there was in the peppers, onions, and chicken was completely washed out by mouthfuls of salt. I boxed up my leftovers, but I'm pretty sure they are going in the trash."}
{"text":"Great, great food!  Everything was really, really fresh, obviously chopped and prepared right after we ordered it. The table-side-made avocado dip is to die for; not your usual guacamole. Creative entrées -- especially the burritos -- which are HUGE.  I highly recommend the chicken and chorizo burrito with queso sauce. Excellante!!! Sorry, no room for dessert.  Will try the mango cake next time."}
{"text":"Such a delicious place for fresh Mexican cuisine .   I always get the fajita burrito and its alway perfect .  They serve fresh guacamole made to order and the staff is superb   Can't wait to eat there again ."}
{"text":"So I was looking at the menu which didn't seem to have very many interesting things on it so I just ordered the chicken fajitas. As I was handing my menu back, I noticed there were two whole more pages that I didn't unfold to see. Well anyway, I thought the food was very good. Everything did seem fresh and the staff was fast and very courteous.   The fajitas were very good but there could have been more chicken. It seemed like they only used chicken breast in the fajitas, and I know a lot of people prefer white meat and I get that they are catering to an American suburb, but a little cheaper cut like chicken thigh could have allowed for more. They do guacamole at your table but I opted out since I was alone and knew I wouldn't be able to finish a whole bowl of guacamole by myself. I will be back."}
