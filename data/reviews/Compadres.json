{"text":"Expect exceptional service & great authentic food every time you go dine. This place is a real find!! (5 Stars)"}
{"text":"Go there on Tuesdays for Jumbo Margaritas! The food is pretty good, and the service is awesome. My girlfriend and I will continue coming back!"}
{"text":"4 stars only because I haven't ordered anything else but their chicken fajita burrito. It's HUGE and topped with queso. I'm a fan. Also really good margaritas. Try their cucumber margarita if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Chicken fajitas are good! BUT, prices are way too expensive & slow service compared to other authentic Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. Salsa was bland. My chili   Rollenos were terrible - the pepper was hard not cooked enough. Service was poor. Husband felt the same way. Never again!"}
{"text":"The food and service are pretty good.  My only complaint was the music that was playing while we were trying to enjoy our dinner.   it was a Friday evening, there weren't a whole lot of customers, and the customers that were there were all over fifty or so.  I don't think any of us enjoyed the Mexican rap and autotuned music.  I guess I'm over the hill."}
{"text":"The food was great! Very good salsa recipe & the chicken taco salad was exceptional. The restaurant was very nice & clean, and we had excellent service."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around. Always fast bringing the order out and delish! Staff are accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and atmosphere. Our food was ready in 10 minutes! A little pricey for what you actually get but it was very yummy!"}
{"text":"This is a really good Mexican restaurant in the Painesville area.  It doesn't look like much from the outside but has great service, great food, and they are quick with your food.  I would recommend this spot to anyone that is in the area."}
{"text":"Good place for inexpensive mexican food.   Excer service both tomes I have gone.   Fajitas were good and only 6 bucks on the lunch menu.  It was an excellent deal!   Im gonna keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I got tempted the other day and went to this place as is next my Karate place. Service is quick and friendly. We were seated right under the television which was on with low-volume but it felt like it as if we were sitting under a loudspeaker. Food was warm. As soon as we were done eating, it made us feel heavy and sleepy. This is not a good sign. I believe if food is too heavy greasy or not fresh I would feel this way. I ate only third of the typical vegetarian enchiladas dish. So something to think about."}
{"text":"Nice variety of food. The seafood chimichanga was full of seafood only and not filler! Nice! I'm lactose intolerant and they made alterations for me when I requested it. Good gold margarita."}
{"text":"Very good food. Decent service. Affordable. The food comes fast and portions are large. Salsa is excellent. Rice and beans were a bit bland. Will return"}
{"text":"Good Mexican with great Margaritas. A decent selection of Mexican beers, and a really friendly wait staff. I have been here many times and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about five times, usually on Sunday afternoons.  This is definitely one of the top Mexican restaurants I have been to.  Inside is decorated in the typical, bright southwestern colors of a Mexican restaurant. What sets this place above others is the friendly staff, fast service and comfortable atmosphere.   Located in a strip mall in a quiet part of town, it's easy to overlook this gem of a place.   Huge menu and variety."}
{"text":"Not only is the food fabulous but they are speedy!  It is easy to get in and out of here even for lunch on a work day.  Chips/salsa terrific and one of the best margaritas in town.  In addition, I am used to Mexican food from CA where a lot is authentic so take this into account on this review and others."}
{"text":"I have been going to Compadres for the past 4 or 5 years.  Fortunately, they are about ten minutes from my work, so I am able to go there often for lunch.  The food is very tasty.  I have not been to Mexico so i won't pretend that I can attest to whether or not it is \"authentic Mexican.\"  But I can speak authoritatively as a fat guy with experience eating at many Mexican restaurants when I say that Compadres is the best Mexican place in Lake County.  I have taken many co-workers here for lunch and meet my wife and kids here from time to time as well.  My four year old, who won't eat anything voluntarily, sits right down and tears up five tacos on Taco Tuesday.  My favorite dish is chori-pollo.  This is a grilled chicken breast smothered in chorizo sausage and melted queso fresco, served with an amazingly fluffy rice, refried beans and tortillas.  The servers are so attentive that they normally know my order before I sit down.  Very friendly staff.  The only knock I have on them is the chips and salsa can be inconsistent.  Sometimes the chips are totes awesome, sometimes they taste like the fryer oil needs changed.  The salsa seems to be varying degrees of spiciness (all good!) depending on the day.  Highly recommend this place.  Muy delicioso."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The beef wasn't seasoned. I doubt I will return here. I've had better down the street from here."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in the area. Service is friendly and fast food is great and margaritas excellent"}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of a hidden gem! We were skeptical to go at first because of its location in the back of an outdated shopping plaza but were pleasantly surprised at how tasty and flavorful the food is. We split the chorizo and cheese dip, an order of ceviche, a quesadilla, and fully loaded Mexican fries. Everything was absolutely delicious and in the future, I will choose Compadres over other fancier, more expensive Mexican restaurants I've been to in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food.  This place is hidden away in a dilapidated shopping center in Northfield but don't let that scare you away.  We had the ceviche for an appetizer and it was excellent!  I had the Camarones A La Diabla and it too was very well done and tasty.  We also enjoyed the free chips and salsa they provide when you are seated.  The salsa was excellent.  The service was top notch and quick.  New full glasses of water just kept appearing, I never had to ask for a refill.  The bill was 40 bucks for the two of us, which was quite reasonable for the amount of food and the excellent service.  This is our new go to place for Mexican!"}
{"text":"My husband loves the wet burrito and the bake nachos where huge.    Plus the staff are on top of their service."}
{"text":"I'm the absolute worst customer!  Being a former server all I ever see is the bad, but I had the most enjoyable dinner last night.  First time here... the food (enchiladas) was amazing, prices were fair (about $50 for two of us for dinner and drinks...margaritas.... YUM!  But the best part a server that was right on top of everything.  Pleasant and that sense of urgency you don't seem to see much in servers any more.  Thank you Carmen!  We will be back...OFTEN!"}
{"text":"What is it with you Clevelanders drowning everything in this processed queso sauce?! You wouldn't know Mexican food if it came in dancing La Cucaracha with a Mariachi band in tow and threw salsa on you?   This place is a spinoff of Taco Bell as a sit-down restaurant.   I grew up in Southern California and spent the majority of my days eating Mexican food... real food cooked by real Mexicans. Nowhere in that state is queso a thing. I have also eaten Mexican food in New Mexico- also cooked by Mexicans. No sign of queso there either. And the ground beef! Neither state uses ground beef in their tacos unless you are at Taco Bell, by which, SURPRISE! Its not real Mexican food. Somewhere, someone's abuela is saying 25 Hail Mary's 40 Our Father's and rolling over in her grave. Trust me.  We came to Compadres a couple weeks ago for dinner because it was slammed busy and the numerous good reviews. Boy was that a mistake. My hubby ordered enchiladas and I ordered tacos. everything was ground beef and drowned in queso. It was like a heart attack on a plate. I actually felt my arteries crying out for help or an angioplasty. The service was also terrible.   Never again. I will have my dad ship me some spices and I will have to make my own Mexican food from now on. A taco is carne asada, onions, cilantro and chile on a soft corn tortilla. None of this hard shell Taco Bell stuff.   I realize that this is probably a regional thing... the processed cheese sauce and lack of flavor. We are VERY far from the border. If I were to open a Mexican restaurant in Cleveland, it would fail miserably because people would die of flavor overload at the tables.   My tip to you all, travel. Experience real foods. Don't be afraid to experiment with flavors. Don't expect that this is actually Mexican food, because its not."}
{"text":"Best Taco Tuesday ever! Love it. $5 for 5 tacos. They are great! Taste fantastic. You'd think they'd skimp on a dollar taco but they don't. It's chuck full of meat lettuce and cheese. You can order $15 worth of tacos and the family is happy and full. Tuesday hang out!"}
{"text":"We just love the food and we have had really great service!  Marco is our favorite!"}
{"text":"They  are always very nice in here.. And the food always comes out super fast .. U dont have time to finish your chips and salsa ..."}
{"text":"Just tried this restaurant for the first time last night and we loved it. Yummy margaritas, friendly helpful staff, and delicious food. My husband is not a fan of Mexican food but even he said he would love to go back soon."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!!  Excellent atmosphere, very fast service. They get the chips and salsa out to you literally immediately (we weren't even sitting yet!) and they taste wonderful! Based on the location, you wouldn't think such a great restaurant would be hiding here, but this place is one of the best Mexican restaurants I have been to!   I ordered the \"wet\" burrito which was excellent. Chicken was cooked properly, tender and flavorful, though not the best chicken I've ever had. They give nice, hefty portions and even the salad was delicious. Everyone's selections turned out to be good, and our party was completely satisfied. Come here if you want the complete Mexican restaurant experience!"}
{"text":"This place is spot on each time.  The whole family loves it. Usually hubby and I order the Chimi roll appetizers and split the moljacete. Food is consistently good each time, never had a bad meal there AND never had bad service. Food always comes out quick no matter how busy. No not 100 percent authentic but definitely not like Taco Bell as one reviewer claims. So much better. Also to clarify the reviewers claim that there is no queso in Mexico is absolutely false. Different regions have different dishes. Part of my family up here is from Mexico, and no they don't  do queso. But I have been all over Mexico and I can tell you that deep in the heart of Mexico, copper canyon region yes queso exists! I know because I ordered it in error before lol. Just because you think you know one region of Mexico doesn't mean you know all of it!! And because you lived in Cali, been to \"New Mexico\" does not mean you qualify as an expert on Mexican food...it just makes ya look silly saying theres no queso in Mex. Long story short...excellent food, excellent service, excellent price. We regret whenever we choose another restraunt over this one. Usually that decision is made because they do not have a patio. Can I give 10 stars?"}
{"text":"Had dinner on our way across the country. Standard Mexican fare, good service, typical hacienda-style decor, and good prices. Food portions are also generous.  We had their chips and salsa plus a side of guac - chips seemed fresh made and were awesome - plus a good amount for two people. The salsa was very good, thin with tomato chunks and fresh cilantro, not spicy, but flavorful, and also a good amount. Guac was very fresh with an oniony flavor, but no discernible spice or real depth. But nice because of the freshness.  For dinner, my sister and I split the veggie enchilada plate which came with 2 cheese enchiladas, 2 spinach enchiladas and 2 mushroom enchiladas, plus salad, pico, sour cream and yellow rice. Surprisingly there were no beans in the enchiladas or on the side plate. The enchiladas were made with wheat tortillas and were overwhelmingly cheesy. So rich it was almost too much. The portion size was huge and we were both totally stuffed. I could not imagine eating all 6 enchiladas plus the sides if I was alone!   Total bill with tax and tip $18 and change. Great value, and I would recommend, though this is not what I would call 'real Mexican' or 'authentic'."}
{"text":"Head and shoulders above any other visit. The servers were attentive but not intrusive and the food was fantastic. As long as they maintain this level operations, they will surely become a local gem."}
{"text":"Not a whole lot of great Mexican food around these parts.  The restaurants that are here are very similar with identical menus and somewhat bland tasting Mexican food.  Perhaps I've been spoiled after living in Texas for a few years, but this is honestly how I feel about the food in the area.  Despite this, I enjoy Compadres because I the food tastes good.  I've carried-out from here on several occasions and have always enjoyed their food.  Probably some of the better Mexican food in the area.  I came here a few days ago with two other people for a birthday celebration. The hostess did a great job seating us.  Other than that, the service pretty much ended at this point.  It took 15 minutes for the waiter to introduce himself and get our drink orders.  We specifically requested the appetizer come out before the entres.  Of course, they came out at the same time approximately 45 minutes after being ordered.  The one thing that did come promptly was our check.  Despite the very medicore to below-average service, the food was tremendous.  Chips were fresh and warm.  The salsa tastes great with a wonderful blend of cilantro and a hint of habanero.  The appetizier sampler is a great value. For the main meal I had the vegeterian enchiladas which was a beast of a meal: 6 enchiladas--2 cheese, 2 spinach and 2 mushroom.  Simply tasted awesome.    I'll carry out here again, or perhaps sit by the bar to catch a game (very cool looking and nicely decorated bar area with a nice flat-screen TV), but I don't think I'll come here to dine in.  I hope your experience will be better than what mine was."}
{"text":"Everything was pretty good and our orders were delivered quickly.  The staff was attentive and helpful.   They charge for extra chips & salsa if you are wanting more after the first bowl. This isn't much of a concern as the bowl is rather large.    I ordered the buritos mexicanos.  It was great, I just wish the portion size was bigger."}
{"text":"I have no choice but to give this place just one star. My family stopped in here after a karate practice at the karate place next door. I will have to say that the server which prompt courteous polite and very apologetic. He didn't warn her that there were some weird stuff going on in the kitchen. They bring chips and salsa, but the salsa is pretty bland and could stand to use a little spice. I had a beer and we ordered our food. The kids ordered off the kids menu, and I ordered the burrito special which was a chicken burrito and a beef burrito. It was pretty pricey at 10 99 but I figure the burritos would be massive. I was sorely mistaken because it looks like they were made with 8-inch tortillas. At the 25 minute mark for waiting for food I ask the server what was going on he apologized again and said that the kitchen is really backed up all the place did not look that full. When the food came out the place too hot for the food was cold and I mean cold to the touch. The cheese was not even melted. Sadly, we sent the food back and told the waiter no thank you and he apologized profusely and comped the bill. Feeling shining star of this place would have to be the waiter, I don't know why there are so many 5 star reviews but from my time here he clearly is a place I will not go back to."}
{"text":"I stopped in Compadres for a quick dinner before going to a concert at Rocksino. There is really not much else in that area as far as good food is concerned, and Mexican is usually a safe bet for a decent meal. So we tried it.   It was definitely a quick meal. Our food was brought out in about 5 minutes which was nice especially since we were in a hurry to begin with.  It was just two of us, and we ordered burrito dishes.  The chips and salsa brought to the table was ok. I would say that was probably the disappointing part of the meal was the salsa. It had that dishwater taste and wasnt spicy at all. The chips were typical chips. The entrees were quite large,  I ended up taking more than half of my plate home.   The waiter was very nice as well as the ladies who greeted us at the door. I have no complaints about the service. The place also seemed neat and clean. The food was just very ordinary and nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Very bland food, that is drenched in canned sauce. The salsa had WAY to much cilantro in it, but I guess you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Meh... It all tasted the same which is why I am not a big fan of Mexican anyway.. Rarely can one find Mexican that has a diversity of taste or spice...It's only my opinion so research for yourself!"}
{"text":"Consider Compadres for your next lunch or dinner. The consistently diver quality food in a fast and friendly manner."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. The staff is always very friendly and welcoming. The environment is also very welcoming.   The food, I feel, is authentic. It is always fresh and the presentation is always authentic. I usually get the enchilada dinner which has 6 enchiladas: 2 beef, 2 cheese, and 2 chicken. They cover the enchiladas are covered in sauce to look like the Mexican flag. They use red sauce on one side, white cheese sauce in the middle, and green verde sauce on the other to look like the flag. My dad always gets the ceviche and says it's the best he's ever had. They also have drink specials Monday through Saturday. They also have Taco Tuesday!   Definitely check this place out if you want authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food inconsistent and bland.  Service is decent though.  Not a place I would write home to Mom about.   Margs are horrible.  I will never get one here again.   Tried on several occasions.  Gross."}
{"text":"Hmmmm. I'm from California and have really high expectations for mexican food.  As one of the newer mexican restaurant in the area I was never really intrigued enough to stop in. My dad actually found a 20% coupon in the mail so we decided to go up there to eat, have a couple drinks, and watch the game.    The greeter was very kind and our server was very enthusiastic, but my dad was quite upset when he found out they didn't serve beer nor did they have a Sunday liquor license.  While waiting for the food I noticed a couple of the guys chasing each other and whipping each other with towels (quite unprofessional).   At last the food came out after about 15 minutes.  My enchiladas were pretty good, but my dad was claiming his beef tacos were on the saltier side.  All in all... Mediocre place nothing that really stood out...mediocre food and mediocre service. Good for a quick takeout meal on ur way home."}
{"text":"Great place.  The food is always good and reasonably priced. I take clients there all the time and they love it.  My kids really love it!"}
{"text":"This is definitely no Dos Coronas and I'm done giving it chances. The service is okay and could be better. The food is the same way. Don't spend the money on the brochettas, they have done a surprising job on finding the smallest shrimp to grill. It is mainly all grilled peppers with a few shrimp. You get about 10 little shrimps, it would probably be more convenient of they skewered them on tooth picks. Also a poor choice to not let customers swap rice for salad. Lastly, I will quit coming here because I'm tired of the plates coming out so hot. Serve the food hot, not the plates."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican Dish, and very quick! Came here on my lunch break and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here with my family a few times and we always have good service and good food. The chips and salsa are good, including the cheese dip. Most times it's not spicy which is good for most of my family. One of the things we like the most is the grilled chicken. Whether it's in a burrito or whatever, it's very tasty. Tacos are good too. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"My sister and I were here yesterday.    Really a nice place.    Lots of room.  Could easily have a gathering there.   And most importantly, the food was delicious.   I had the chicken fajitas. Good size for a lunch special.   Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Food was eh though. My beans were a purple color and had zero flavor. Also inside my bean burrito was chunks of meat... not really what a vegetarian wants to find. Salsa isn't is flavored anymore. It was like I was dipping chips into a tomato. I'm looking for spicy Mexican food. Not this. Plus the prices have went way high! What happened here? It cost $30 for me and my two young kids. They had a kids meal and I had a bean burrito. I'm done coming here. So sad."}
{"text":"Tuesday Tacos!!!! Come on down! 5 for $5 and the Modelo beer is great! Tip your servers they are friendly!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Compadres ever since it opened. I'm not sure what is going on but the food quality and quantity is dropping.  Service can't be beat as the waiters and waitresses are fantastic."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place to eat for sure!  Great food and awesome margaritas. Would love to see a patio here though."}
{"text":"The best taco's and taco deal in town, 5 for $5! Margaritas are excellent as well and the have specials on them 3 days out of the week. The staff is great and very attentive."}
{"text":"Living in Painesville we're lucky to have our choice of good Mexican restaurants. Our favorite is Compadres. Although I have to agree with other reviews that the margaritas aren't the best. But that's where the negatives end. Service good, selection good, food very good. We are always getting coupons in the mail too, which is nice. I usually get our order to go and it is always hot and ready when they say it will be. I usually get the molcajete which is basically every ingredient they have well seasoned in a volcanic bowl. Last night I got the Puerto Vallarta burrito which was like a miniature version of it. My wife got the Pollo con Espinaca, which she liked. We also got the queso and chips and they give you plenty of salsa too. We'll be back, for sure. If you read my previous review of Moe's, Compadres is everything Moe's isn't. But if you want to throw your money away and go to Moe's you obviously have so sense of decency or taste, jk."}
{"text":"So boring it makes me weep to think that anyone would eat here and consider it good.  I wasn't super hungry so got a mushroom quesadilla.  It was grilled mushrooms in a pool of oil on cheese that tasted like it was Velveeta.  There was sour cream, rice, and refried beans which were lavender and tasteless.  My husband ordered a 3 enchilada plate, which literally had 3 rather unappetizing enchiladas on it, and a separate plate with some lettuce, pico de gallo and guacamole.  The chicken enchiladas were shredded breast meat, but with no spices, salsa, taste.  Apparently slow cooking the chicken with picante sauce and chicken broth or similar never occurred to the chef.  And there was no rice, no beans on an entree that seemed like it should have them - even if the beans are purple.  The chips were cardboard-like, the salsa more like ketchup with some additives.  I mean, seriously??  Nor was it particular cheap.  The entrees were generally in the $14.  That's what I used to pay in Napa, CA for and wonderful, tasty entree at one of our favorite Mexican restaurants.  This place has no right to be called a Mexican restaurant.  I used to go to the Mexican place that was in this location 3 or 4 years ago, and it was good.  Not the best Mexican food, but good.  And there was one in Sagamore Hills for a while.  But this place is an embarrassment.  I have no idea how this place stays in business - why anyone would want to eat her more than once - but it makes me sad to think that anyone might eat here and think that's what Mexican food is all about."}
{"text":"The worst mexican I ever had...chilli rellento was horrible tastes like from a can. I agree with Jared F."}
{"text":"Great staff!  Great food!  Even better Margaritas and Coronaritas! Definitely recommend the Chicken Fajitas.  Ole!"}
{"text":"There is simply nothing bad you can say about Compadres.  They always put out coupons galore so you never pay full price.  You can always get seated without a wait, even though the restaurant is usually busy.  The service is great and margaritas are even better.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Quick tips:  - the entrees we had were relatively solid. Well constructed - lots of food for the money - the margarita on the rocks was very sweet.  - we ordered shots of Patron on the side for the margs - very generous pour for the $ - Service was spot on - Bathrooms were clean! :) - Salsa was a B- it was tasty but lacked substance and anything to differentiate it from any other place. - beer selection was good as well.   The place was very clean. The service was more than adequate. They deserve more business than was in there. I would definitely go back if I was looking for a quick, inexpensive meal. Would have given more stars but some elements - beans/rice - were pedestrian."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in NEO!  The food and service is always great, but be advised we usually go at lunchtime when it is pretty slow.  The only knock is that they don't have a Sunday liquor license, which sucks when u r eating there and want that much needed margarita!  And they are very good margaritas."}
{"text":"Only ok. Nothing to write home about. I tasted one if my girlfriends tacos and it was tasteless greasy beef in a taco shell. Difficult to choke down."}
{"text":"So, my best friends recommended this place to my husband & I. First time we went, it was roughly around lunchtime on a weekend. We were sat quickly, chips & salsa are pretty good. Ordered our food less than 10 mins later our food was served to us! (Not sure about you, but I'm highly impressed)!  Halfway through our meal, I ordered a small strawberry margarita, no joke by the time we walked out of there I told my husband I was light way buzzed.   Now fast forward a handful of visits...the last time we were there(our Anniv. July 2014) it was dinner, pretty busy, got seated in the back, NO AC, and the place smelled like sweaty gym socks!"}
{"text":"Delicious salsa, guacamole and chips - everything tasted fresh. I had the enchiladas mexicanas - beef, chicken and cheese, each with a different sauce - perfect for when you want to try different favors. I loved it. Frozen margarita was good too. Service was quick, very friendly staff. I recommend when in the area!"}
{"text":"The food I got here was cold and below average. The ground beef didn't even look like meat. I would not suggest this place to anyone whenever someone suggests going there I tell them no. I never plan to eat here again unless it's the only thing open and I'm dying of hunger!"}
{"text":"Truly, this a surprisingly excellent restaurant tucked away in a little strip of shops on the north side of Route 20. My cousin and my daughter are big fans of Compadres and now I and my girlfriend are, too. The two of us love Mexican food and have been to many Mexican restaurants and we found this to be one of our favorites.  We dropped in on a Saturday evening and had a little bit of a wait. The restaurant was bustling and we were probably the fifth or sixth couple waiting for a table. The hostess was very pleasant and conversational, which was the same disposition as the rest of the staff we encountered. We had a table within 20 minutes, a surprisingly short wait for a popular date night.  Our server was very attentive and we didn't have a long wait for our food to arrive; about 20 minutes at the most. Our plates were filled to the edges, so portions were plentiful and hot, not to mention very tasty. We never had to ask for drink refills and a second server came by to check on us while we were eating.  We had a really enjoyable dining experience and can't wait to return to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am from Texas, and I was blown away by the food. I always get the Enchiladas Supremas. Everything tastes fresh, and is worth the price. Ice cold cervezas and beers decently priced. Great atmosphere, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great food menu was a little hard to read and translate but that did not stop us food came out very fast and was more than happy with it  Service was good but have had better  But if I'm in the area again and want Mexican I will return with out hesitation"}
{"text":"Finally able to celebrate sweetest day and so exhausted after a full day that I told fiance this place would be fine. Our Dos Corona was booted out by giant Eagle and could find a location to reopen.  So we drove on over to dilapidated Northfield Plaza and decided to check this place out.   The chips were not warm and barely a handful  the salsa wasn't bad.  The menu hard to locate and understand combination plates  nice choice and clear for lunch.  But at 830p needed to find how to locate combination for dinner.  2 items and 3 item choices  both overpriced   the food was good. Had a cheese quesedia and beef enchilada and rice. Asked for no beans extra rice. They spread rice to make look extra.   The food was decent but with the price I can't say would rush here to get Mexican food.  Would like to check out taco Tuesday 5/$5"}
{"text":"I wanted to give five stars because the food is amazing.  However, I elected on 4 stars because the margaritas aren't very good at all.  They had a $4.99 special and it tasted like  lime-flavored syrup.  But enough about the margarita.  Let's talk about the food.  I've been here several times and tried a few items, but my new favorite dish is the molcajete.  I'm not sure if I spelled that right, but you know what I'm talking about.  Shrimp, chorizo, chicken, and steak are blended with peppers, tomatoes and onions and served in this giant vessel.  It kind of reminds me of fajitas but much tastier.  The best part is that there's enough food to enjoy for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING ):  Food is very bad and employees are not very nice. I wanted the 3 steak taco dinner with beans and rice. First she rang me in for 3 tacos a la carte. I told her I wanted the dinner she said it didn't exist.   I had to point it out on the menu that it indeed was an entree on the menu of the restaurant she worked at and she changed it so I could have my sides.    I asked them to make them medium rare because I was reheating them once I got home.  The host replied \"I'll tell the other girl who speaks Spanish to tell the kitchen but I can't promise it.\"   \"Okay, whatever\" I thought. My steak was WE DONE, stuff, dry and tough. I took one bite and through it away. It was honestly the worse taco I ever had in my life. Doesn't help it was just dry beef with NO cheese, NO sour cream, NO lettuces or tomato. just meat in a tortilla.   It said it came with a side of pico de Gallo but I GOT A SIDE OF DICED ONIONS!!!!!  I'm really offended because it's not authentic and barely edible."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for the first time last night, and had a great time. We were greeted and seated immediately and had chips and salsa 30 seconds later. It was a busy night but all was very clean and comfortable.   We ordered and had our food hot and ready 5 minutes later. Both of our meals were good and filling. Our waitress was one of the best I've had anywhere and the prices and selection were great too.   We will be back and wish we had tried this place sooner!"}
{"text":"It has always been on my \"To stop and check it out\" list.  First impressions:  Parking lot, very clean, storefront was vibrant, a newer development.  We were greeted promptly, and shown to our seat.  The facility was very clean and inviting.  We were given a bountiful amount of hot fresh tortillas and salsa, which the waiter always kept full and/or asked if we wanted more.  I ordered the Tortilla soup to start, as with most Mexican restaurants, a lot can be determined by how the establishment prepares this.  It came out on a large platter, in the main bowl was the chicken, along with broth, in one side dish was hot (temperature) rice, and in another side bowl were the tortillas.  I thought this was cool because I can determine how much of what I would like in it.  I have never seen this done before, and I personally think it is a great idea!  I got a combination platter with the taco, tamale, and enchilada, all of them beef.  They were are prepared perfectly with presentation and taste.  Along with those came the re fried beans and rice.  The platter was just a perfect amount of food, not too much to the point where your sides were splitting when finishing it, and not too little to the point where you did not get your money's worth, it was perfect.  My buddy also got a combination platter, and enjoyed it, he also got a pina colada margarita, which he said was great, along with fried ice cream.  He did mention the fried ice cream was good, but nothing really out of this world.  All in all we had a great meal from start to finish.  The waiter was on the ball throughout the service.  There was one downfall, which is not the end of the world, but I was soooo looking forward to it on an 80 degree day and after running almost 3 miles at the gym, that is (drum roll) they do not have beer!!!!  They have margaritas and other frozen drinks, wine, and liquor, but no beer.  I found it odd that they would serve the hard stuff, but no beer... Really in the mood for a Dos Equis Amber.... must be the type of liquor license they have, hopefully they will work on that.  If you like Mexican, you will love Compadres in Painesville, Ohio."}
