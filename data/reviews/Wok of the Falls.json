{"text":"This place is consistent and will do special requests. Friendly service and some of the best wonton soup around"}
{"text":"This should never be a first choice for Chinese food in the area.  For any decent Chinese expect to drive 15-20 minutes outside of Olmsted Falls.  In one carry out order I had chicken the was undercooked.  You ask for items mild and they kill you with spice.  They manage to kill all flavor in dishes like Sesame Chicken and Governors Chicken.  Their foods are terribly, excessively greasy.  Worst of all they dreadfully prepare fried rice as yellow rice and not brown rice.  The rice should have been the first sign for me to just walk away."}
{"text":"I always got good food here. Maybe not the best but i always enjoyed it. I used to work at Angelinas pizza and would stop over there for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money here. The food is greasy and gross. Took a bite in the car and threw it in the trash at the next gas station we drove by... Never done that with Chinese food before! The sauce was tasteless. The woman who answered the phone was really rude too.. I got the Szechuan vegetables and asked what veggies came with that... She became really rude and got mad that I was even asking and was like \"I don't know! Vegetables!!\" Long story short... I was asking because I hate bok choy and that was pretty much the majority of the veggies in it. Egg roll tastes like it's from a freezer too.  Do yourself a favor, and just don't go there. Yuck..."}
{"text":"Been to Wok of the Falls for years.  Consistently good food with fast service.  I recommend the sweet and sour pork, egg rolls, and chicken egg foo yung."}
{"text":"The quality seems to have gone down hill over the past few months. The egg rolls now taste like frozen ones, but the veggies in the stir fry were still fresh tasting."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times.  I have always enjoyed what I've ordered.  The menu contains typical Chinese dishes, but I have my favorites so I don't try that many different things.  If I wanted variety though, there is plenty to choose from.  Tasty food with big portions and good prices."}
{"text":"This is the only place in the Falls to get Chinese food. This will be the first I have ever given a bad review.It's just a take out joint, so there's no dine in service...no biggie. The people are nice, the portions are just fine, but the food is just not tasty. I honestly can't think of a bad Chinese  restaurant I've ever been to before, and I've been to them a lot...and in many different states. In fact, I went to one in Mexico that was WAY better than Wok of the Falls. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to slam the place! It's right by my house and I WISH it was good, but it's not. It's bland and tasteless. Their lomain noodles are angel hair pasta...YEP! First, second and third time I though...maybe it's me. Nope, the place blows! Do yourself a favor and drive up the Great Northern. There's a couple places around the mall that you can google with way better results. Sorry Wok of the Fall... I wanted to like you. :-("}
{"text":"New to the area love Chinese food especially sweet and sour chicken so i thought I would start with Wok of the Falls well I should of started some where else the chicken was chewing and the sweet and sour sauce was not sweet at all! I won't be going back any time soon"}
{"text":"Good standard American style Chinese. Best in the area. They take no shortcuts unlike other places that use too much \"instant\" stuff. Try the sub gum wonton soup - lots of meats and veggies.  Great place if you live nearby."}
{"text":"We had the chicken fried rice, wonton soup, chicken egg roll and a general Tsos meal. The kitchen was clean and service was fast! The food just doesn't make it worth going back. It was all pretty awful. The chicken in the fried rice tasted like chicken loaf, salty and soggy. The rice had barely anything else in it. The general tsos was real chicken but had a soggy, pasty breading. The broccoli was perfect and the Wonton soup and egg roll were just okay. I love to support local so I'm disappointed we won't back."}
{"text":"They have a nice array of Chinese food, won ton soup is always spot on. I usually order pepper steak with fried rice. Since I prefer things on the spicy side, I ask them for extra spices in the steak, and they always remember the spices even on a pick-up order. One of the best local Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to grab take out. The food is consistently good, the service on point, and the time from ordered to ready is under 15 minutes. We've been going for over three years and have always been satisfied!"}
{"text":"They are okay. American Chinese food prepared quickly, massively,and cheaply. I have been getting take out here for more than ten years. I must admit in the last couple of years the food seems to have slipped and we don't go there nearly as much as we used to. There seems to have been a management/ ownership change that has affected them.  Go with average expectations and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good.... and the people who run the place are really nice.  Couple of times I've asked about a dish and they included a small amount for me to try for free."}
{"text":"Best place we have found for Chinese in Olmsted Falls. It is good and portions are big. They over do it on the broccoli."}
