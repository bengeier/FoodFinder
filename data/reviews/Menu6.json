{"text":"My friend and I went to Menu6 last Saturday for the first time, during the Porchfest. We picked this restaurant because I found out that they have happy hour on Saturday too (4:30 - 6:30).   We got there about 4:45 and we were the only customers there. The decor inside was very chic, a pretty trendy look. We opted to sit at their patio, so we could watch people going to the Porchfest.   Their happy hour menu consists on a few selected drinks for $6, appetizers for $6, and 3-course meal (pick one from selected appetizers, one from selected entrees, and one from selected desserts) for, I believe $26.   We wanted to get a couple of beers and appetizers to share between us, so we asked our server guy for his recommendations, and he recommended to get some shrimp appetizer, sweet and spicy calamari, and beef ribs with mango BBQ sauce for appetizers and we got all three.   Shrimp appetizer came with 3 large shrimps, cooked in something similar to tempura batter and served with the peanut sauce. The batter was a little bit too thick for my liking, but the flavor of the sauce was okay.   I like the calamari appetizer the best out of 3. It was cooked in a sweet and spicy sauce. The sauce had some diced red and yellow peppers and had a good amount of a kick to it.   Their beef ribs were cooked until the meat fell off the bones. I didn't really tasted mango in the BBQ sauce, though.   All three appetizers were okay since they were at the happy hour pricing. I don't think I want to pay more than that.   I got beer from tap that our server recommended. I'm looking at the receipt and it says \"Chimay\". It was okay, but for $8 happy hour price, it seemed the glass was small... I guess I'm used to those 22oz tall boy glass at those less-fancy joints...   Our server was a little bit on the slow side, giving the fact that the entire time we were there, there were only 2 more tables occupied.   A guy, I think it was a chef, came to each table and asked us how everything was. I thought that was nice.   Am I going to go back? Probably not... It was just too fancy for me."}
{"text":"Bad Experience!   Walked by waiting for our table at Felice, down the street. While examining the menu posted on the door, the owner/chef walked out and worked very had to convince us to eat there.   When we finally agreed, we sat down and waited to place our drink order. And waited some more. There was more wait staff than diners, but we were ignored for more than 15 minutes. The owner/chef sat at the bar, talking to another staff member - I don't know if he noticed when we walked out.   Won't be going back - that place is too pricey to be scrounging at the door/ignoring customers."}
{"text":"Nice decor,good service and the food are pretty good. My wife have the cat fish special and the fisf was cook perfect! I have the chicken wings,French onions and Lobster mac & cheese. Mac & Cheese was little too rich for me."}
{"text":"We went to menu6 as a birthday celebration. The restaurant was not busy when we arrived, which was due to the early reservation, but it never picked up. It was super slow. The atmosphere was dark on one side of the dining area and brightly lit on the other. Unfortunately, we were seated on the line of demarcation for the lighting challenges.  The service and food were okay -nothing to rave about. All the orders were taken at the same time, but a friend has to wait an additional 10 minutes for her ravioli to come out. The salmon I had was \"fine\" the out-of-season asparagus was the best thing on my plate - the duck my husband had was overcooked.  The pricing reflected a service and taste above what was provided.  I'm sorry to say that this restaurant has all the telltale signs of a decline. Low number of diners, over-staffing, and a recent menu overhaul. Hopefully, the manager/owner will revamp again, and Menu6 will remain open on Larchmere."}
{"text":"Nice designed and having a food forward type of  global influence cuisine, from Caviar to Foie Gras, parsnips to Kalamatta olives, Artic Char to Quail..... just delicious! Great Service and nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Several vegan-friendly dishes on the menu and a chef willing to modify others to make them vegan."}
{"text":"Two of us went to this restaurant at about 6:30 on a Wednesday eve.  The place was really quiet, except for a few tables of people.  We were served some bread rolls that seemed a little stale.  We ordered the calamari to start.  They were covered in a sweet and sour type sauce which was too sweet for me and I couldn't really tell if they were supposed to be grilled or fried, there may have been some of both.  We then ordered the white fish dish, which was served in a curry type sauce with what seemed to be linguini pasta.  I don't really enjoy when italian pasta is mixed into Asian dishes. An Asian noodle would have been great.  The lobster \"dumplings\" were interesting, but noting exceptional.  We also ordered the warm arugula salad which was good, a little rich and a little small for the price.  While the food was enjoyable enough, there was nothing there to pull us back."}
{"text":"I came here after buying a restaurant.com certificate and thought I would give them a go.  It wasn't the best dining experience, but I would be willing to go back and give them another try.   (1) we were the only patrons dining, but service was extremely slow, albeit friendly. (2) some of the ordered dishes were unavailable, which is annoying but it happens. (3) the food was underseasoned, which is funny in a restaurant that doesn't have salt and pepper on the table.  I have a pretty balanced palate for salt, and my husband likes his dishes slightly underseasoned.  So if he finds it underseasoned, it is bad. (4) I liked the menu in theory, but found the food quality to be not worth the price tag.  Had I not had a coupon, I would have been peeved.  I can honestly make better dishes than what we were served.  All this being said, from conversations with friends that have had great meals here, perhaps it was an off night.    If not, they are in trouble because there are many other restaurants serving entrees in the same price point that serve a much better meal (e.g. Fire, Greenhouse Tavern and Lolita)."}
{"text":"We went to Menu6 for the first time this week and though we enjoyed most of what we had, it did not live up to my expectations.  The menu was unusual and unimpressive. Normally the menu sounds great at many restaurants and then you're disappointed when the food comes. This was a bit of the opposite.  A very scarce selection of entrees included 1 chicken, a few beef, 1 duck, ribs and the rest seafood. If you like seafood combos, this may be your menu as there were 3 different ones. There was not a shrimp-only entree and no vegetarian (though the waiter said he could provide a vegetarian menu) or lamb. All but a few of the entrees came with garlic mashed potatoes including, to our surprise, the lamb chop appetizer. There were only two salads on the menu, a nicoise and a romaine wedge...the nicoise seemed too filling when paired with the rich entree choices and a romaine wedge seemed an odd and unimpressive option for an upscale restaurant, so we passed on both. So after eating mashed potatoes with our appetizer, both our entrees also came with the same. When we asked for a  substitute all that was possible was french fries or spinach...no baked potato or pasta options which we found lacking.  Was also surprised to find no seasonal vegetables like parsnips, beets, yams, sweet potatoes, zucchini, pumpkin or squash (there was a side on 1 entree), but instead there was out-of-season asparagus on most of the entrees.  And the asparagus were a bit of a disappointment as they were steamed extremely al' dente with just a little oil and lemon...grilled would've been a nice alternative.  On a positive note, we were thrilled with the olive tapenade that came with the warm, toasty bread, the calamari appetizer and lamb chop appetizer were both a wonderful blend of sweet and savory with just enough of a kick. I would rate the value fairly high as the cost was not overly expensive and portions were more than adequate. The fundy salmon entree was done to perfection with a light honey glaze. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu. There was a large party there that night and he always kept us informed of our meal status and was very attentive. The dessert menu was similarly limited (chocolate cake, carrot cake or tiramisu) and surprisingly unimaginative, but the tiramisu was probably the best I've ever had.  They were out of the bread pudding and the banana gelato.  Still, given the season and rich entrees and appetizers offered, a dessert with pears, pumpkin or apples was an unfortunately oversight.  All in all we had some pleasant surprises, but had a hard time with some of the limited choices.  I know the menu changes often and hopefully the next one will see some improvement.  Hopefully one with more of a focus on seasonal items with choices for side dishes.  The waiter did say their website has the most recent menu, so we will be sure to check next time before going.   We'll give it another try as it's obvious that this chef is very talented.  If I could given it 3.5 stars, I would've."}
