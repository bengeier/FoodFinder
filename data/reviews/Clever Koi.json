{"text":"Excellent food and service very friendly servers would seriously recommend the tuna chips and soft buns."}
{"text":"I will eat there 2x a month and always get
The Pork Ramen.  Its pretty tasty,and such 
Comfort food for me. Normally pork doesn't do anything for me, but this was ok"}
{"text":"Loving my server Daisy! She's is the best ever! The menu looks amazing and I can't wait to try everything on it! I'm having the pig face to start. Super tender and I adore the house made sriricha. Yum!"}
{"text":"Our server was awesome, but that's about it. I ordered the ELEVEN DOLLAR!!! \"Studied Abroad\" mixed drink (that came in a teeny tiny martini glass) and it was completely undrinkable. Our server took it back and recommended the \"Little Sheba\" and it was only slightly better, but at least it was a tall glass. It ended up sitting on the table 3/4 full when we left, and that's with 7 drinking ladies that tried it and wouldn't touch it again. The food was not as great as I hoped. It was not bad, by any means, but no one's food was fabulous and the prices were pretty high for how small the portions were. Also, don't go there on a Saturday evening if you intend to have conversation with your dinner companions because the acoustics in there are atrocious...we had to lip read. Sorry. I really wanted to like this place, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"After months of wanting to go here, my girlfriend and I finally made the trip to Phoenix to try Clever Koi. The ambiance and overall decoration of the restaurant is modern and hip with a little asian flare. There is also outdoor seating with heat lamps for the colder months. 

But the point of this review is to express how much I loved their food! We started with the kung pao wings that was super crispy and delicious as well as the steamed buns. The steamed buns were my favorite part of the meal because the pork belly was so crispy and tender, which complimented the soft bun. We both got ramen (lemonpepper chicken and pork) and they were both one if not the best ramen in the valley. The pork broth is super rich and flavorful with a good size portion. But my favorite of the two was the lemonpepper chicken, this may sound different than your typical pork/miso ramen, but it works amazingly. 

Overall Clever Koi is one of the premier places in Phoenix to go to. My recommendation is to go during happy hour if you're trying to snag some deals ($8 pork ramen, $5 wings)"}
{"text":"Ate here last night with a friend. Ambiance is nice, food is Asian fusion.  They served traditional Asian steam buns taco style,  you can pick different meats to go inside your bun. I got the cat fish which was yummy...and I got the soft shell crab which was burnt and not that great.  I also ordered the pork ramen...the serving was huge and I couldn't finish it. The pork and noodles in the soup was good but I didn't realize there would be kimchi in the soup and for me kimchi in ramen broth don't mix.. that is on me, just a personal preference.   Now when it was time to go we asked to bring our leftover ramen with us....they put the soup in boxes with holes. Of course it would spill on the way out...anyway, hoping management would get proper spill proof soup containers for their customers who may have leftovers. Bottom line, it's a nice place to eat, service was great and some of the food I had was good.  But 2 fancy ramen dishes, four steam buns and a cocktail for $63 is a bit much in my opinion."}
{"text":"The resturaunt itself was nice and our waitress was amazing, but we were super dissapointed. I was super excited to hear that they would be in walking distance since ice heard such good things about them, but we will probably not be returning. The food was very bland and super pricey for the amount. My husband and i both felt that the chow mein made for my daughter was better tasting. So sad. But the pork bun was off the chart, we would probably just use this place for drinks and date night, otherwise I'll stick with somewhere better. But according to my husband they do have a changing station in the mens room which is super hard to find. 2 stars"}
{"text":"I experienced two firsts last night. (1) It was my first time at Clever Koi and (2) the first time I've ever gotten physically sick from eating food. We had the Tuna Chips, Calamari Fries, and the Black Vinegar Barbecue Ribs. I'm not sure which one it was, but since I'm the only one who got sick and only I ate the BBQ Ribs, while the rest of the table split the other two, I'm assuming it was that. I felt fine at first, but a couple hours later I found myself throwing up. 

Will never go back."}
{"text":"A place so nice I came here twice...well three times within a week. This is the type of place you want bring your friends and loved ones to. I've come here for lunch and dinner.  It's also vegetarian friendly. 

Ambience: attracts lots of different groups from business professionals to students to hipsters. 

Service: very prompt, friendly, and knowledgable about the menu and drink items. I've had nothing but great service here. 

Lunch: limited menu which kind of stinks but they make it pretty fast. You get to customize your own bowl á lá chipotle and they have their delicious fritters available for dessert. I think the fried rice bowl is my favorite but you can do chow mein, soba, udon or ramen. 

Dinner: the best time to come. Our waiter told us that he recommends everyone order something different so ppl can taste everything. We ordered the dumplings, seafood soup, crab steamed buns, cauliflower ramen, and the lemongrass chicken ramen. My personal favorites were the crab steamed buns and cauliflower ramen, but they were all delicious. The steamed buns are a HOME RUN. I can't imagine anything disappointing here. 

Price: decently priced, the steamed buns are a little expensive but they're so good that $4 seems like a steal."}
{"text":"I love this place! Went here for lunch, and they have a great build your own bowl with a variety of basses, protein, and veggies. The food is very good quality and the atmosphere is trendy and comfortable. Our server was very knowledgeable about food allergies and which items are gluten free which is amazing."}
{"text":"Virtually nothing vegetarian or vegan on the menu. Disappointing. We left. Lots of great options near by. Went to Thai Tiger down the street. Definitely not as swanky but yum and they have great options for veggies. Most places, particularly hip ones, have started to take pride in having great tasting and creative options without meat. Too bad this one doesn't."}
{"text":"Food is good but way over priced for the level of flavor. definitely a \"meh\" rating. I could take it or leave it."}
{"text":"Excellent Asian Fusion. Good service and have not tried anything on the menu that hasn't been Yummo!"}
{"text":"Tried a variety of this new restaurants' offerings over 3 visits. The octopus summer roll starter was amazing with great dipping sauce,  beet salad flavorful and light, octopus and duck buns great, pig face dumplings also great, for main had the seafood hotpot noodle bowl, this was one of the best dishes at an Asian restaurant I've ever had, the space is beautiful and reminiscent of New York City or LA styles places, hip crowd, great bar and service, overall great experience"}
{"text":"Service is pretty bad. Waiter running around and didn't know what he was doing. Drink order was completely forgotten."}
{"text":"Their Asian inspired food was delicious. If that wasn't enough to get a person to come back their cocktails are always so creative, and taste superb. Having now gone here since they have opened I have always loved the new seasonal menus that they come up with. Have yet to be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to the restaurant several of my friends raved about. They were right to rave. I loved the layout; it was open and inviting. Every dish we had was a true reflection of the chef's excellent reputation. I'm really looking forward to going back to explore more of the menu and the awesome drinks. It's a great place to go with a group of friends or for a nice date night out. The prices were reasonable and the food was fresh. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I can not explain to anyone exactly in words why this place is so good. All I can say is I've worked in 50 plus restaurants and bars and have 13 plus years in the industry (not just in Arizona). This place has something between simplicity and charm within hitting the bull's eye while still having just the right complexity. These guys are pros with passion. You can see it from their golden jiggers to their innovative drinks. I recommend this place for a  unique business lunch, a well elaborate deep thought at the bar while discussing cocktails travels and the food you're eating, or dates for multiple courses with extreme value. Then if you want to get more tipsy ( as this not that place) you can venture next door once you're full. Then catch the light rail, valet , or catch a cab home. prime location for dates as there is a pond near by, hair salon, and wine bar. Cocktails Kick ass!"}
{"text":"The food at Clever Koi is fine....I've been twice and not been wowed either time.  BUT--tonight we had the bananas foster fritters with miso caramel and they were OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I will come back simply for these fritters.  Also, the service was top notch--the servers were so kind and attentive and super knowledgeable about the menu.  I wish I liked the food better, but the dessert and service were worth the 4 stars!  Also, their patio is dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Came here and the place was PACKED, waited for about an hour but it was totally worth it. My friend and I had the pork belly and the chicken and waffle steamed buns, rabbit dumplings, and duck curry. All of it was so delicious. Loved the steamed buns the best :)"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to The Clever Koi. I didn't know what to expect, and this eating establishment wowed me! I was very happy with my overall experience. From the service, to the ambiance, music, good positve vibe, and most of all, the FOOD! This is what I call a true fusion of different Asian dishes with American and other cuisines. 

It was a little late so I ordered the Soft Shell Crab from The Small Plates menu, which was served with julienned green apple, smoked daikon radish, fingerling potato, and buttered panang sauce. It was a total explosion of wonderful savory flavors in my mouth, not to mention, the texture. This dish really left a good impression in my mouth and my mind. I also ordered the Chicken and Waffle, a kimchi waffle with scallions, and chili maple. It was surprisingly good. I will definitely recommend this place to friends and family and I will be back to try the other offerings on their menu."}
{"text":"I hate and love this place
I wont recommend this place to my Asian friends who come from Asia, but it's an interesting place, every thing looks fantastic, certainly a good place for dating, I like to try all kinds of food  just because I love exotic feelings. The first time I went to clever koi I thought it's an Asian restaurant by non-Asian owner who knows Asian food, and I tired a pork Ramen it just looks so right,  first bit isn't impressing, then I find a little bit sour from the soup, so they put kimchi in to a bowl of Ramen! Seriously?(Ramen and soup is from JP it never will be even a little bit sour and Kimchi is from KR which should be pretty hot and a little bit sour but the soup neutralized the hot left only sour taste unnatural) It destroyed all my good feelings about this place. The second time I went here, I tried the same Ramen without kimchi That should fix my feeling than BOOM. I was wrong, it's not even better than the first time everything taste boring   at lest kimchi works better. After that time I never ordered any 'looks and sounds like Asian food' no more, turns out all the other is as good as it looks I'm glade."}
{"text":"The prices for an imported beer were too much, you can get a large orion somewhere else for the same price.

We ordered one of each type of bun, I loved the pork, chicken and waffle were okay, the crab was the favorite.

We also got the pig face dumplings which were tasty, but the texture was a little off.

Overall very tasty, I'd like to return for their entree dishes."}
{"text":"It's tough to find good ramen in the valley, but this place has it.  Great place to take a date.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"WOW a new phoenix hot spot \"great atmosphere with quite unique food\". Met a friend at who knew about Clever Koi for dinner. We shared  the duck, curry, steamed buns (best), fish dim sum (unreal good), fried rice  and more.  Clever Koi is my go to spot when in central phoenix and hungry. Waitress real nice bar and kitchen staff totally approachable. Had a funny named cocktail fusion drink and knew I would be coming back with sig other to show off my find.. Guess were I'm going tonight after suns game you got it Clever Koi. Also love the patio, custom sign at entrance is welcoming and chandelier over hostess station is sweet touch.. Lucky we are to have choice like this thanks Clever Koi owners and staff."}
{"text":"Been in here three times now. The service is always good and the food is phenomenal! You can tell the owners really put a lot of work into creating great food and a fun vibe."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food, and great service!

The octopus in both of our meals was delicious. We both got seafood options, and they were great! We also ordered the donuts for dessert, and they were so tasty!

The portions aren't huge, but I guess it helps with not over-eating!

We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from LA and my sisters took me to downtown Gilbert.  We walked around looking at the menu of a few places.  We picked this one because the menu was interesting...fusion Asian.  We passed up other restaurants that my sisters have gone to and liked to try this one.
We ordered Kimchee fried rice, tamarind mole (short ribs) and pineapple duck.  They brought over home made sirachas (red and green).  I was really excited about our dinner.  Unfortunately we found the food not very flavorful given that the names of these entrees imply much more flavors.  My sisters kept saying where's the kimchee part in the kimchee fried rice and the pineapple in the pineapple duck?  I found the dishes we ordered to be bland and glad we had the sirachas to add to the food.  And I can't eat very spicy so it's not that I'm the kind of person that need food to be exploding in spices. We sat next to a couple at a community table and they really liked their food but they ordered different items than us (calamari fries was one of their items).
Overall I really liked the ambiance and the service but was not impressed with the food at all.  If you are looking for some unique flavoring,  I don't feel they have achieved it.  Good concept though but they need to kick up a few levels in the flavors department to get 4 stars from me.  Service and ambiance is definitely 4 stars.  I really appreciate the community tables as we showed up on a Saturday night with no reservation.  Being from LA, I appreciate just being to get in on a Saturday night with no reservation."}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly excellent! It came out a little slow but it was good, i go to lunch with a very picky co-worker whom usually does not like the places i choose but yesterday we found a winner. Food  was very fresh, but make sure you have time to wait."}
{"text":"Good food, good ambience, just a little loud.  Our appetizers fell a little flat but the entrees and dessert were spot on! We had the lemon pepper ramen and seafood hot pot followed by bananas foster fritters that were amazing! It's a cool local place that I would recommend to anyone who likes Asian food!"}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place. The actual restaurant is beautifully decorated. Went with a couple of friends for dinner. I actually enjoyed the meat; however, the Pad Thai was very disappointing. I do not consider myself a picky eater in the least it tasted like chow mein flavors poured over Pad Thai ingredients. My friend had their duck curry, and that was very good."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Definitely recommend the soft shell crab and pork belly buns, to die for! For entree we shared the pineapple duck. It so good and wish there were more of those delicious vegetables! Minus one star for team service. So bizarre and can ruin the customer experience and personal interaction of dining out. At least they were up front about their team service structure. Drinks had minimal alcohol, but were definitely hand crafted and tasty!!"}
{"text":"The LOVE this place!! The food is AMAZING!! The service is always GREAT! Everyone is so engaging. If you haven't eaten her yet, you're missing out! Thanks Clever Koi for another satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"My friend and I popped in quickly for lunch. David was our server and helped us navigate the lunch menu. We were in a huge rush and our food arrived promptly. Food was really good, fresh and well prepared.  Looking forward to trying them for dinner"}
{"text":"Best Asian fusion in Phoenix. They do spicy really well.  Try the smoked and grilled octopus."}
{"text":"The Duck Curry, the ambience, the music and our server Kaitlynn made the dinner experience great. I would certainly visit this place again."}
{"text":"Ambiance didn't feel right for some reason, between weird mood from employees, music not consistent with the restaurant theme and outdated china and silverware. Our server wasn't very helpful and he took forever to serve our entrées (over 30 minutes), plus he didn't follow through with our drinks; I had to get ahold of a different server to ask for an additional drink, dessert and check.

On a positive note, food is very flavorful and well presented, but they're not good enough reasons for us to return."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely amazing, service and atmosphere is beautiful, very pleased with my meal and definitely will be returning. The freshness of the ingredients were amazing, the house made Sriracha blew me away. Thank you for the amazing meal and showing so much hospitality. I recommend this restaurant to everyone who loves Japanese food with a modern twist"}
{"text":"The food is excellent but the price you have to pay and i think you dont get much which was a litrle disappointing, the drinks are great but a litrle on the high side.
Noise level is high, not a romatic ave, but its like a football game is going on,.but its ok.
Over all, i ordered the kimchi with rice, if i am going to pay 13.50, i need the bowl at least half full, just have been to mant places.and they just dont give you enough, the bowl was 1/3 full! Not!!"}
{"text":"A very unique  place, a terrific experience!  Bartenders are top-notch, personable, helpful, and friendly!

David & Alex are terrific, and the drinks are a special experience, as well as the food!"}
{"text":"Clever Koi is one of my favorite restaurants. I just might be slightly biased due to the fact that we are practically neighbors and Jared, one of the owners personally introduced himself while canvassing the neighborhood prior to their 2013 open. The same personal care and intention goes into each dish. 

Last night we ordered To-go for our valentines day dinner. I had the roasted cauliflower ramen and kale soybean dumplings. The dumplings were gone in under a minute they were so good!! I wasn't expecting the ramen to be as creamy as it was but was pleasantly surprised! My boyfriend order steamed buns. He had the slider and the pork belly. All I have to say about that is a quote from last night, 
-\"this pork is the single greatest bite in Phoenix.\" 

I'm glad vegetarian options are popping up again on the menu. See you again soon!"}
{"text":"I own an auto shop nearby called Flop Shop Automotive. When Uber eats started up in the area I gave this place a shot for lunch. I am a one man shop so leaving to get lunch can be a pain. So I tried the broth based bowl with noodles from
The lunch menu. It's amazing. Perfect flavor and right size for lunch menu. When I think of noodle bowls I no longer think of ramen noodle cups but this place. Try it for lunch you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We tried this place last week during happy hour. Good drink selection and a ton of lower priced food items. We tried the pork ramen and it was amazing! Our drinks (old fashioned) were also good. Sadly, nothing else was. We had the pig face dumplings, which were fairly flavorless. Their only redeeming quality was the house made sriracha. The duck hot bun was okay, but nothing special. The pickled ginger on top overpowered the whole thing. All in all, it's a cute place and HH is decent, but I don't see is returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I would not recommend Clever Koi. Food was not bad but was not worth it, especially since there are so many great restaurants in this area. We had a table of eight and everyone ordered something different. Not even one meal was above average. 

The decor and ambiance was nice sitting outside on the patio. 

Service during the meal wasn't horrible but we went through all the water and was never asked if we wanted a refill. Our server did answer questions and gave recommendations.

 But the worst part of the night was that our server told US to figure out the separate  bills. One of us just ended up paying. 

Overall, I will not return. There are so many better restaurants in this area."}
{"text":"I love every bit about the Clever Koi.  Have been there for lunch, dinner and late night snack.  It never disappoints.  Personal \"favs\" - Hands down - the pig face dumpling is the \"perfect bite.\"  My wife and I are committed to good food.  That is to say, we fly places to eat - sometimes across oceans and borders.  It is heartening to know that Clever Koi is just up the block, a bike ride away.  We like to sit at the Chef's bar and watch all of the food coming out of the kitchen.  The seafood hotpot is delicious.  The fired vegetable platter is a great starter, or night ender.  The sliders never disappoint.  And everyone, from the owners, cooks, servers, mixologists are pleasant.  If I had a restaurant that I had to take to that deserted island for an unknown duration of stay... Clever Koi would be my top pick.  The food comforts and delights all at the same time."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this place out. They did NOT disappoint. We started out with the great happy hour deals- sampled the ENTIRE list and then moved onto the buns, dumplings and entrees. Highlights-black bean/celery root cakes, chicken and waffle buns, shrimp/scallop dumplings, soft shell crab buns and banana fritters. The owners, Josh and Nick were great resources in helping us choose amongst the many offerings. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant couple of time for dinner. Excellent food and very happy with black rice as well as noodles. I was really impressed with vegetarian options as well. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite.  Owners work along side all servers and kitchen crew. The bartenders offer amazing suggestions. Love this place."}
{"text":"Trendy new restaurant. Came here for the first time and was not disappointed. Asian inspired food which is almost but not quite authentic which is perfect when you want something more interesting than the standard Americanized Asian food but also want something more upscale than truly authentic Asian food. The Korean short ribs were very close to what you'd expect at a Korean bbq place in los Angeles but with extra finesse and presentation. The drinks were similarly interesting and delicious if you're like me and enjoy something that's equal parts familiar and new. The bar knew what they were doing, serving up solid options even when I strayed from the cocktails menu and ordered something custom. Will come back again soon."}
{"text":"Sampled some dishes over the past couple of years at food/drink events and really enjoyed their creative approach. When I got to go to the restaurant with friends we were not disappointed.
Great flavors, servers and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service! Get the chicken and waffles and pig face dumplings :)"}
{"text":"Amazing! One of my favorite spots in the valley. I crave the ramen even when it's 110 degrees outside. The belly buns make me happy and a couple cocktails don't hurt either. I can't knock anything about this place. Try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came to this place with my wife. The location was good, decor and atmosphere was relaxing. The menu offerings were to our liking; we're very adventurous and the Asian fusion fits our palates well. Check out their happy hour. Great prices and they offer it every day. We'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Best cocktails . . .maybe in all of Phoenix, I need to do more research before making such a bold statement. In the meantime, the cocktails are worth the wait! First, I ordered the sour times which takes longer to make than drink but watching the bartender craft this concoction is like watching a science experiment resulting in one of the best drinks I've ever had. It's as pretty as it is tasty. We ordered the pork belly steam buns which was by far my favorite thing on the menu and next time I come here I may just get 5 of these and nothing else. I also had the pig face dumplings which were good but pale in comparison to the steam buns. Last I ordered the Kimchi fried rice with duck. Surprisingly I got the choice of brown or white rice which I fully appreciate and have not received at most restaurants when it comes to fried rice. This was a great fried rice and good for sharing. Overall it was a great experience all around. Friendly and attentive wait staff, beautiful outdoor dining, delicious food, and superb drinks."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing.  Favorite is the pork ramen.. Great for dinner.  Happy hour is the perfect way to try different stuff."}
{"text":"So disappointing! 

We started off with the calamari fries and steamers. The calamari fries were okay, but the batter didn't have much flavor/seasoning. There was also no lemon or dipping sauce with them. Some sauce was drizzled on top, but overall they tasted plain.

The steamers looked incredible and i really wanted to like them but they were SO SALTY. All i could taste was salt. I wasn't able to get past the saltiness of the dish.

We then ordered two steamed buns - pork belly and chicken and waffles. The first thing i noticed was how small they were! My boyfriend could finish one in two bites. And for $4 each you'd think you'd get just a little more. The pork belly one was decent, but the chicken and waffles wasn't so good. The chicken was dry and the waffle bun was soggy and fell apart while you were eating it. The most confusing part of the plate was that it came with a side of dipping sauce? It was way unnecessary and didn't fit with either steamed bun we ordered. 

Lastly, we thought we'd try the scallop dumplings. Also looked pretty good when they came out, but were also extremely disappointing. I don't know what was in them, but it did NOT taste like scallops, or even seafood. The filling was dry and the closest thing it tasted like was chicken. The sauce on it was confusing. Did not meld well at all. I don't know what kind of flavors they were shooting for, but it was a complete miss.

Our meal after tip was over $60 (including drinks). We left hungry and unsatisfied. The atmosphere was awesome and we were excited to try someplace new, but unfortunately we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Just found this place and took my wife for lunch, who is an Asian food snob. I loved this place and she finished her meal, which she NEVER does! GM was nice and inviting, staff was great ant the food was obviously made with care. You can taste the dedication . We will be back! Can't wait until they open in Gilbert in June"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Got the fall harvest rice bowl which was awesome. For dessert got a pear cobbler which was over rice and again delicious. One of the better restaurants in the Phoenix food scene for sure."}
{"text":"I agree with the hype . I would go during happy time and order the burger. Its so ono"}
{"text":"We received amazing customer service here last week. I feel bad I forgot our servers name, she had shoulder length blonde hair, pretty and extremely friendly and professional...didn't skip a beat! We sat outside in the patio, it was beautiful! Had the crispy duck, it was delish. We had several appetizers, every single thing was so good, there were 8 of us and we were all satisfied! I love the happy hour deal on Tuesdays, 2 entrees for $40 with 4 brews or a bottle of wine! Check them out if you haven't yet, will def. be coming back!"}
{"text":"Hip, Clean, Artsy environment, I would suggest going dinner as the lunch menu is limited.  Great speciality drinks with and totally asian fusion"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices and nice ambience. We sat at the bar and watched the cooks prepare our food, which I always enjoy. The cook struck up some nice conversation with us and was very friendly. The menu was just the right size - not too daunting with good variety. For appetizers we got the calamari fries and the brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts themselves are enough to go back. So good!!! For entree, we ordered the wood fire grill plate with flank steak. It was healthy and tasty and fresh - perfect if that is your mood. We also ordered the pork belly and the duck confit steamed buns. The pork belly was my favorite of the two. I look forward to going back and trying the mongolian beef bowl, the spicy seafood hotpot, and the bananas foster fritters. They looked so yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from SOCAL and found this place via yelp. WOW. That's all I can say about this place. The chicken and waffle dumpling was way over the top and then I washed that down with the seafood pot. AMAZING. I washed all of it down with two cocktails which were also insanely great. The vibe felt like it should be in LA or San Diego and the food was easily the best thing I have had traveling in a long time. I would absolutely eat here again and probably will before I bounce. GREAT FOOD...GREAT DRINKS...GREAT PLACE"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but after waiting about an hour & half for our food only for it to come out cold I was so beyond disappointed. Didn't help that we watched countless tables around us get their food before we did & they ordered after us some even got seated after us. I didn't mind that the food was over priced I'll gladly pay whatever for good food but the wait was so unbelievable & they didn't even offer anything to make it up to us."}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time last week, and I have nothing but positive things to say.

Had the asian style meatballs, Chicken Kastu, and Pork Ramen. All full of flavor, and cooked to perfection. The soft egg on the katsu and ramen were a great touch.

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Most items on the menu contain pork or sausage. I had the Kung Pao Fried Chicken without the Chinese sausage. Came with confit potatoes, peas, peanuts, and this delicious chili sauce on your choice of brown or white rice. The chicken had just the right amount of spice. It was delicious! Wish we had one of these in D.C."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time during Restaurant Week and this was the best meal I've had in a while. My wife and I sat at the bar overlooking the open kitchen. I had the roasted corn dumplings and kung pao fried chicken. I didn't take a photo but I should have because the presentation was very appealing, and they tasted even better. 

The dumplings were a small pond of a tomato ginger broth which had the perfect amount of spice. The kung pao chicken was the same idea as you'd find in an American Chinese restaurant except everything was fresh and cooked perfectly, not greasy at all. My wife had the caesar salad and mongolian beef. The salad was a fairly typical caesar but with szechuan croutons and a poached egg on top. The mongolian beef was, like the chicken, the same idea as  what is offered at American Chinese restaurants but more sophisticated and executed to perfection (the roasted cashews were a nice touch). 

And then they went ahead and nailed dessert. The fritters were fried and they were delicious. And the tea-a-misiu was a great tiramisu but with a hint of tea, I think I liked it even better than regular tiramisu. 

Well done, Koi, we will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing place and the friendliest staff. Awesome food just tops it off. Visiting from California and this is a must to return to!"}
{"text":"Excellent Asian fusion; their house made soda cocktails are very refreshing for happy hour and pair well with the extensive list of dumpling and steamed bun appetizers. Entrees are ramen, rice, and meat entrees which are filling and above average in quality and taste. Overall, worth coming back to and centrally located near Phoenix's downtown nightlife."}
{"text":"Friday night was our first trip to The Clever Koi.  So glad we did as we discovered that the woodfire entrée s were incredible!  For appetizers you couldn't beat the calamari fries.  The vegetable chow mein with pork belly was amazing.  We finished off with one of the dessert specials.  Our server was top notch and very attentive, not once did we have to try and flag him down.  Go for the service, return for the food!"}
{"text":"Food. Drinks. Service. This place has it all. 

From the beginning they have something for every one whether you want to play it safe or try something new. That applies for both food and drinks. Now let me say this in no way is authentic but rather a fusion style of food. 

A rotating menu and bar program may stink at times because you might loose your favorite item but is an opportunity to find a new favorite. 

We have been going for several years and always come back. I insist on trying new places and using Clever Koi as my bench mark and nothing beats this place. Even one of their bad days still outshines many other places good days."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, service and food are excellent!! The grapefruit lemongrass homemade soda is refreshing on a beautiful Phoenix day. We got the bowl with udon noodles, I got pork belly and friend got steak, delicious!"}
{"text":"3 drinks + eight dishes + 2 desserts gave four of us a good feel for the Clever Koi style. This multi-Asian concept food needs more definition.

The drinks were topped only by the beet salad which was the best of the bunch. The ramen is a good value on the HH menu. Most all meats seemed a bit mushy and ALL of the dishes (except the hot pot and octopus) had a cloying undertone of sweet.  Kung Pao Brisket with no pow, hot pot seafood where the hot was all of the chili variety. Octopus that was tender but served over \"crispy\" rice that just seems like the bottom of the rice pot floating in sauce. Duck bun with interesting, yummy meats but not \"Peking\" and couldn't taste \"charred plum jam.\"

The restaurant is in a nice reused building.  Parking is behind the building, enter on 1st Ave. for comp valet.  Consider sitting outside if the weather warrants it so that your clothes and hair won't reek of cooking smells.  (Wow, maybe this is the authentic Asian part of the restaurant!?)

If I lived in the area, this might be a nice little place to toddle over to for a bite.  It's not enough to get me to the downtown area for supper out."}
{"text":"Just recently discovered this restaurant and can not get enough of it! The atmosphere, service, and food is on point. Try the pork belly steam buns to start they are my favorite."}
{"text":"omg!!! this place is tot awesome;-) went there for a date night and man oh man did we have a great time. everything about this place is all good!!! i cant think of a bad thing to say about it!! food/drinks/ atmo all wonderful. will make it our date night spot!!!"}
{"text":"This new place is fantastic! Eclectic Asian fusion with flavors that burst in your mouth. My wife is gluten-free, and they are very careful, thoughtful and helpful in what they can and cannot do gluten-free for her.  There are many gluten-free choices on the menu, and they can tweak many of their items to make them gluten-free. And the cocktails!  Wow!  Jackson and Liam are fantastic behind the bar.  Many of their cocktails are handcrafted.  Rayanne is warm and welcoming upfront. Great people, great service, and great food!   This is definitely one of our go to places."}
{"text":"Unfortunately there is not a 6th star because they went above and beyond! The whole dining experience was amazing and both my girlfriend and I are now big Fans! We always heard great things about the restaurant and wanted to check it out.  From the moment we walked in we were greeted promptly with friendly welcoming energetic smiles. 
The owner (Nick) knew it was a special occasion for us and went above and beyond. We started with two appetizers and specialty drinks with entrees to follow.I had one of the Tiki drinks which came out in a fun mug and tasted amazing! (let's just say they don't skimp you on the alcohol) I won't go into the specifics of what we ordered because that's not what matters to me, especially because every single dish truly tasted outstanding, unique and unforgettable.The flavor is truly astonishing! It will leave an impact on you that has you craving for more days later. Along with the amazing food I will remember the true passion Nick and the staff had. The few things I look for when going out is, great food, aumbiance and good service. The Clever Koi, has all of this and more, thank you so much for providing us both with a unforgettable, unique, fun evening! We will see you all again soon! 
Cheers"}
{"text":"Excellent food, very reasonable prices, super great staff from door to table and a fun comfortable atmosphere. I love this place and happily recommend it to anyone I meet. A great place to dine alone at the wok bar ( lots of fun to watch them prepare the food) or with friends at a table. It's even fast at lunch... 
Check it out I do believe you will find many delicious choices . One of my favorites is a Kung Pao Brisket. Second favorite is perhaps the Massamon Udon Curry although I have not tried anything I have not liked. The menu offers quite a wide variety  of well thought out dishes and tastes.
Clever koi gets my favorite new restaurant vote for sure."}
{"text":"To the point-

We were only given the build your own meal menu. I've never been there before, so I'm not sure if that's the lunch option only or what. You can build your own ramen, rice bowl and one other thing I can't remember. I had ramen. Ramen starts at $5. Meat option (no matter what you choose is $3). I subtracted 1 star bc I only got 2 pieces of pork belly. Where as, if you order steak for your ramen, you get a generous amount. I'm confused? $3 for 2 pieces of pork belly is a little steep. Pork belly was absolutely delicious and I wish I could've had more. Veggies were $1 each. Sides were extra $.50 like egg, kimchi, etc. How is a side of egg $.50 but like a couple of julienned carrot is $1? Oh.. I didn't order the carrots, but oh well. Now the broth, it's alright. I've had better at a ramen place in Tempe, but both can't compare to my ramen place in Chicago, but that's besides the point. I felt as if it was a little bland. Could've been slightly richer (for pork broth). The steak and lemongrass chicken were delicious though. 

I ordered 1 appetizer. I can't remember the name, but it was fried, had Sriracha and kimchi. It was delicious.
The drinks that were brought out to other customers looked soooo good, but I didn't order any. Customer service was great as well. Server was attentive. Establishment was very clean, including the bathroom. 

Basically -2  bc some of the pricing didn't make any sense and flavoring of broth. Would I come again? Of course. I tend to give a place another try, unless service was absolutely herrendous."}
{"text":"Nice asian fusion place. We ordered the tuna chips and chicken chow main, both were delicious."}
{"text":"Nice spot! Can't vouch for parking as our friends live next door and we walked over.
Ordered a white ale, wonderful.
Husband ordered a fancy pants mixed drink. (He orders based on the name.. although he won't admit to this. I think it was called bad news something..) It took 5-10 minutes to make, that kind of fancy. It was strong and he enjoyed the detail and it took all night to drink, haha.
We went for some hot asian buns *Yum, miss the ones in Chi-town!!) and they were good. I was drawn to the chicken and waffles but glad I didn't order a 100 for me, because they are SPICY! We ended up ordering random litle pairings of food for the table. Waitress was on point, food delivery was quick. 
Would eat again: Pork belly, soft shell crab (Ok, I'm going to be honest. I couldnt LOOK at those little legs but I devoured mine and it came in a delicious sauce)
We also ordered the chow mein and substituted the mushrooms for leeks. Wonderful.

Great atmosphere, enjoyed the owners. Attention to detail and service while being human-like :) and non-stuffy is appreciated. 
Cute bathrooms (I dont know why that is important, but it is. Every restaurant on Central has cute bathrooms..)
We were some of the last to leave and never felt rushed. Cute spot."}
{"text":"Really fucking good. They were so nice, we couldn't decide so the waiter helped us pick and we ended up loving everything. The waffle chicken is bomb af. So is the ramen and the po boy burger !"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Good service.  Warm and hip ambiance.   The spicy seafood hotpot had a nice balance: spicy flavor and miso background without overpowering the seafood.  The pork ramen had a rich broth, good texture in the noodles, and the pork belly was fantastic. Extensive drink menu."}
{"text":"The Clever Koi is cute and feels very trendy. They have a full bar so this would be a nice dinner or date spot. They usually have some upbeat music playing loudly to help drown out the sounds of the open kitchen.The bar is decently priced for the area, however, this is a very expensive lunch venue now. I do not recommend it for lunch time. That aside they have a great ramen broth and excellent pork buns. They recently got rid of their lunch \"Build Your Own\" option and so now the same order costs $6-11 more than it used to making a lunch cost about $20-25 on average. The rest of their menu is interesting and their take of Asian fare is usually good but lacks a certain zest. The menu items are quite varied with a decent flavor, but nothing really unique you can't find elsewhere. They have a posted menu on Google, but all the prices are half of what they actually charge so be careful in your planning."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Phoenix. I like how their menu changes slightly over time, so there's something new to try. Everything I've tried is good so far, and I've almost tried everything on the menu. I don't like the pig face dumpling as much, actually prefer the other dumplings. I love the stream buns, especially the chicken waffle and the pork belly steam buns. Their ramen and seafood hot pot is excellent, but wasn't impressed by their duck dishes."}
{"text":"Stopped here after getting my hair cut next door. Took advantage of happy hour and started with drinks. My husband enjoyed the dark and stormy and I had a Pimms cup. I didn't love my pad Thai but would choose something else next time. Was bummed to learn the hard way that they are not open on Sunday but am happy to have this spot nearby. Loved sitting on the patio on a nice evening."}
{"text":"Highly overrated, very slow service, oily flavorless food, and unfriendly to menu alterations due to allergies or dietary restrictions. 

Hour and a half wait to be seated. Plates delivered to our table 45 minutes after we ordered. Plates were delivered to our table in a staggered fashion, with long wait times in between deliveries. By the time everyone was served, the plates that had been delivered first were cold. 

Half of the plates delivered to the table were not made to order/specification and had to be sent back.  Plates sent back were delivered back to the table after another 30 minutes and had to be boxed and taken home - the rest of our party was finished eating.

Food was oily and flavorless. Service with a snide smile and undercutting comments - disingenuous staff. 

Hour and a half wait was obviously not due to popularity or cuisine, due instead to poor service and slow, un-accommodating kitchen. 

Too bad. Has potential for a nice vibe and fresh cuisine but instead is a hyped-up Chop Shop with attempts at differentiation via octopus (go to Nico instead) and duck (swimming in curry - a shame!)

This foodie won't return."}
{"text":"First time dining after having seen this restaurant featured on Check Please. One of the few Asian Fusion restaurants we actually liked. The ambience was alive and energetic. We were seated promptly and the service was near perfect. The menu was varied and chock full of interesting choices. And most importantly the food was delicious and creative, being so good I almost reordered seconds. Can't wait to go there again; and it will be soon."}
{"text":"We popped in on a whim and are so glad we did! The ambiance was gorgeous, the employees were super adorable, friendly and helpful, but most importantly, the food was incredible!! 2 of my friends ordered the Seafood Hot Pot and said it was spicy and delicious. My son and I shared the Kimchi Fried Rice with duck, and Pork Belly Ramen. Both were magnificent. We also all shared the Tuna Chips with Wasabi Guacamole and Calamari Fries appetizers. Every item we tried was seasoned beyond expectation! It was a flavor explosion with every bite, and they were reasonably priced as well! It's hard to satisfy a party of 5. Great job, Clever Koi!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time last night, and while it's clear that they're still working out some kinks, I really like the direction this place is heading. We really enjoyed the duck steamed buns (although the pork belly could have been a bit more tender) and the pig face dumplings. The ramen was tasty and the broth was unique (although the pork shoulder requires a bit of work) and my gf liked her kimchi fried rice. The cocktails were stellar, particularly for folks like me who enjoy actually tasting the spirits. 
Needs a bit of work: Service is still a bit rough (if eager), and they should refine some of the dishes. 
Overall, I plan on becoming a regular here, and with a little bit more finesse and experience this becomes a five star spot."}
{"text":"Ambience is really good. Sat down at bar and owner chef was working right next us. He explained us how they made sriracha sauce and all dishes' description. Had shortrib dumpling. Kimchi dumpling. Yellowtail. Seafood hotpot. Pork pot. All the dishes were phenomenal! Definately going back in short time!"}
{"text":"Great food. Memorable and delish drinks, but most impressive is the service. Best in town, hands down."}
{"text":"Bad experience right out the gate. The parking situation sucks. Valet or nothing. It's not like this is a prestigious upscale neighborhood. Well, I'm not going to walk a few blocks with my 6 month pregnant wife. Valet is great - when it's a choice.  Your parking lot has plenty of spots. Let us park our own car. Would've liked to try the interesting menu, unfortunately I probably never will.  Unless I ride the light rail there."}
{"text":"There are so many awesome restaurants in Central Phoenix, but if you want EXCITING and delicious food and cocktails - come to Clever Koi! We have eaten here many times and are never disappointed. The appetizers, buns, entrees and cocktails are all fantastic!"}
{"text":"I finally found the best pork belly in Clever Koi's Pork Ramen.  It is just amazing. Went back 2 days after because my daughter and I could not get over how good the food was. Also ordered the Teriyaki Short Ribs and had the most tender, buttery, melt in the mouth meat, ever! 

Clever Koi has an L.A. vibe that we liked and we will definitely be going back. Can't wait to try the other menu offerings."}
{"text":"Pre-made food, poor quality, worse service
If you think these steamed dumplings are amazing - then you have never had great dumplings. They were too thin, they were overcooked, and they were clearly pre-made. In fact, we were told as much. 
The noodles were soggy and not quite as good as those you get from Kraft.
The Steamed Buns- their fusion item - was thick, doughy and taco like- but without the flavor. 
The duck was overcooked in the buns, the noodles, and the dumplings.
The service was as slow as one could imagine.
Sorry- but when you have had great Chinese food in China, this place ranks below any chain American Chinese restaurant (PF Chang's has better dumplings). 
Hard to imagine that people would really like this place, when there are other places that have freshly made food.
Atmosphere is nice- I imagine the next owner will improve on the service and the food"}
{"text":"This place is doing it right. Local people committed to making great food and craft cocktails in a fun and comfortable setting. 

Pull up a chair in front of the kitchen area. You'll get all kinds of commentary on the food you select and watching Jared work the wok is awesome. 

We've had many menu items. I'm a sucker for \"fancy\" ramen, and this is the best I've found in the Phoenix area. 

Kimchi fried rice, yes please. 

Save room for the fritters - the flavors change frequently. This week we had the bananas foster version with salted caramel - what?! We were fighting over it. 

They have a unique selection of house cocktails. With Josh behind the bar, opt for a surprise - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I know this is a new place and would give it one more shot. The music is way too loud. You can barely hear people at your table. The service is also ok. There were dirty plates on our table from the beginning all the way to the end. They came by once and cleared a few plates but never came back. Also all of the meals were served at different times so when one person waited until the last was there it was cold. The drinks were good and the dumplings."}
{"text":"Clever Choi is very clever.  Good food, nice fusion of different cuisines.  6 of us and we shared each plate."}
{"text":"Being from the bay area and living here, you miss really good ramen. This place will totally fill that gap. The ramen is amazing! The owner is super friendly and the staff is great! Also, they have a delicious home made sriracha :)"}
{"text":"To be honest, I was very skeptical when this place opened because it had very mediocre reviews at first.

We went on a Wednesday night, and it turns out 90% of the menu has changed since it opened. They transitioned to a summer menu and for the most part, it's incredible food.

The steamed buns I would pass on. The Peking duck and the pork belly inside were good, but the bun itself is a bit dry. Also, it's very filling and I wish I had saved my stomach to eat our main course.

We ordered the steak Bibimbap and the seafood hotpot, with the special ($30 for 2 entrees, $5 more to get it with 4 specialty cocktails). The steak in the bibimbap had perfectly crispy edges and tender on the inside. The hotpot is to die for. I don't usually care for thick noodles, but these soak up so much flavor. My boyfriend also does not care for catfish-- except what was in this hot pot. Definitely squeeze some lime into it (comes on the side).

Those cocktails-- amazing. I had the Pimm Jong Il and boyfriend got a tasty canned beer from Nebraska. We also had the drink with sriracha-something in it. You've gotta try it, it's light but with an edge. Also made by a well-dressed man.

What I really admired was the co-owner working the kitchen (we sat at the bar, where there's an open kitchen). He knows so much about the food without being a pretentious jerk. Very friendly and very invested in the food. Wait staff was mostly on point and knew the menu in detail as far as taste/what to expect, so if you're not sure, they can probably give you a good recommendation.

A great place to impress friends, or enjoy a nice dinner on a week day."}
{"text":"I really can't believe I'm writhing this, but maybe this is that one anomaly. We've come here as locals for years.  The service at the bar was terrible. We ordered 3 times and it took 45 minutes to get appetizers. Food was AMAZING as it ALWAYS is but service at the bar was miserable."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and reasonable. We shared a chow mein bowl and a fried rice bowl. All bowls are $5 and then you can add meats and veggies for extra. Sooo good! They have two types of Saracha sauce that are made from scratch. The servers are not bad to look at either and they are really attentive. The place is cool and has a really fun vibe! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"food service drinks, are always amazing. I've been 3 times now and every time I'm so grateful for the good meal and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! The best way to describe it is Heaven in your mouth. I went to the soft opening with a good size group and shared a little bit of everything. There wasn't anything that stood out more than the other because everything I ate was delicious. Each dish was uniquely full of savory flavor. There wasn't one dish that I though was \"just okay\". I definitely plan to be a regular. Although I can't remember the names of all the dishes, some good appetizers to start off with are the Char Siu Beef  Spring Roll and the Smoked \"Pig Face\" (How can you say no to these names?). The noodles are a must try and everything else on the menu is as well. We asked for chef choices and did not regret it. The prices are pretty average, $8 to $13. The cocktails are also unique and rather tasty. We tried the Temperance Trap, The Enabler, and the Honor Your Dojo (again... How can you say no to these names?). The ambience was cool and the service was great! They also have a nice patio area that faces central ave. A must try!"}
{"text":"Been here a dozen times. Always make me feel at home with a handshake greeting and some small talk. The Ramen with all of the a la carte options is awesome, no, amazing, no, perfect. I load it up and yes it can get a little pricey, but you know what...it is probably one of my favorite meals right now in all of the Valley. Pork belly, duck, tofu, love it.   And for those of you carb conscience, get it with bamboo and without the noodles and you will not miss a thing."}
{"text":"Their wings are AMAZING! Had their riesling wine too. Great service. Will be here again!"}
{"text":"Great Asian-Fusion restaurant! We were a group of six, we each ordered different appetizers and entrees and we were all very pleased with our meals. Their cocktail list is very original too! Please do yourself a favor and order the banana fosters for desert, you will not regret it and, most probably, will have to order a second one."}
{"text":"EAT HERE!! Nothing like this in Scottsdale. Creative Asian Fusion. Comparable to New York or San Fran quality. We sat at the bar watched these genius chefs work their magic! Awesome service from Andrew, and delicious food! Tuna Chips amazing, Pad Thai super, soft shell crab in coconut curry to die for! For dessert we topped it off with  a salted caramel  ice cream that was Devine!! We def will be back!!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Food was very good. I had the spicy hot pot with seafood and that was very tasty. We ended up getting the dumplings and a few other dishes that we shared among the three of us. Service was very good. Recommended."}
{"text":"This is an excellent \"Neo-Asian\" restaurant which has a very eclectic menu, full of food combinations anyone would love, if you like Asian or Fusion cuisine. My friend and I had the pork belly buns, Kobe beef with mushrooms, and Vietamese catfish for appetizers. The Kobe beef is just simply delicious and literally melts in your mouth. The catfish is just fantastic with the sauce and the toasted cracker. Then I had the pork Ramen as well as the seafood hot pot. These entrées were fabulous with tons of flavor and  so savory. I slept like a baby after this wonderful meal. If you want to try Neo-Asian cuisine, this is the restaurant to try first. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the few that I have been to that serves great ramen, along with other amazing menu items.  I had a chicken ramen, with lemon grass broth, the flavor was amazing!  My most recent visit I was accompanied by a friend who happens to be vegetarian, their menu had more than enough options for him which was great!  They also off Gluten-free options. Will definitely continue to stop by!"}
{"text":"My review is negative because it reflects the food. The restaurant itself is very nice. Well decorated and servers very attentive. Clean, good atmosphere. However, the food was very disappointing.

Shrimp Toast - breaded scallions with sriracha aioli. Very reminiscent of fried tofu with shrimp flavors underlying, which is definitely not a bad thing. Big flaw with the dish was the sriracha aioli. Tasted like pure mayonnaise. Completely brought the appetizer dish down. A shame. Good in concept, horrid in execution. Dump the sauce and just eat the \"toast.\"

Wok Roasted Chicken Wings - Not bad, but not good. Wings were coated in a \"Sriracha Hoisin glaze.\" The Hoisin was noted. The Sriracha was not. Lacking heat. Also, noted dearth of sauce. Good wings need a lot of sauce, its primary source of flavor. Positive points: wings cooked well and coated with a peanut crumble for textural dimension. Presentation admirable. Taste did not meet expectations. 

Pork Ramen - mediocre at best. Noodles were extremely good, very creamy and filling. Everything else in the bowl was not up to speed. The pork wasn't seasoned, difficult to chew, and overcooked. Bowl had pickled daikon, a welcome surprise, but not enough to elevate the dish. Broth lacked identity, very watery. 

Good Asian food in Phoenix is difficult to find. My review has been calibrated to the lower standards of Phoenix's Asian cuisine fare. 2 Stars means \"I've experienced better.\" So yes, I have experienced better Asian food in Phoenix than the dishes at The Clever Koi. Very disappointing indeed."}
{"text":"Usually the duck curry is pretty good, but this last time it was super watery and really gross"}
{"text":"The artistic presentation is one thing but the flavors you experience are stupendous!!"}
{"text":"This was my third and last time at the Clever Koi. I say this as for the third time in a row, we had to wait ( two of us) at least 10 minutes after being seated to have anyone even recognize or talk to us. This was after being looked at by many employees without even a verbal acknowledgement or hello. Very poor customer service. 

After waiting for the apparent requisite 10 to 15 minutes even to get water, we had to wait an average of  another 20 to 25 minutes for drinks, then apps then dinner. 90 minutes from being seated to eating is absolutely unacceptable. Then to top it off, after self-parking in the lot, and being in the restaurant for over 90 minutes and dropping well over 100 bucks, the valet attendant intentionally parked a vehicle directly behind mine in the middle of the parking lot and blocked me in. It took him 10 minutes, after I asked him to move the car blocking mine, to move the car out of my way. He then had the balls to tell me to never park in \"his lot again!\" That absolutely sent me to the moon. I will NEVER go back to the Clever Koi as I have never been treated so poorly in my life at a business. I will certainly never recommend anyone to go there. Absolutely shameful."}
{"text":"Yeah, super awesome. Buns, noodles, and dumplings solo spot on. Little pricey but pretty classy also."}
{"text":"The staff was great the food was amazing ! Especially the pork belly steamed buns!   Awesome dining experience 
A must try!"}
{"text":"First time here and I will be back. Great atmosphere and service. Had a Udon bowl and delicious. Very well priced as well."}
{"text":"Cool place with a good menu. Great bar selection with lots of options. 

Wife and I split some small plates options for steamed buns, wings and dumplings. I loved the steamed buns while I thought the wings and dumplings were just good. My wife really liked the dumplings though as well as the steamed buns. She thought the wings were just ok. 

She had a ginger ale which they actually make for you, she thought it was very good. I tried a couple of different beers. 

Service was good, not exceptional or anything but definitely good enough. 

We will go back again."}
{"text":"Everything was going so good...and then the wings gotta fu*k everything up. The ambience was smooth and stated; not overbearing. The server, Michelle (?), was the perfect complement too. We ordered a mix: the tuna chips, the koi burger (available only during happy hour), the siracha duck fat wings, and the zesty noodles.

The tuna chips were refreshing. The cheddar and kimchi-loaded burger arrived and its *hella* worth dropping by during happy hour just for that dish. The noodles were a'ight but just be forewarned the dish is overloaded with potent, heavy spices.

Then. The wings flew in. My first bite and I quickly realized I was biting into raw flesh. THE CHICKEN WAS F**KING RAW.  I was like , the-hell-just-happened?  I don't need salmonella; it's the holidays.  My homegirl, Michelle, even grabbed some chop sticks to take \"a sample\" to show the chef. 

The chef said he \"didn't want to risk it\" and insisted he make us another plate. I said no. I mean, \"risk it\"?  Who is going to roll the dice on round two of raw chicken?!  But they still made the dish...and we didn't touch it. But let's fast forward: I was charged for the plate. Okay, but, for real? You are charging me for--what? Looking at the dish that I won't touch? Um. Hi Clever Koi. That's not cool. 

It was over. The honeymoon period was over, and all I wanted was to go back to the start--during that time when everything was going so well and I wasn't paranoid about foodborne illnesses."}
{"text":"So I am back at Clever Koi and I must  correct my last review.  JARED continues to delight with his menu.  Apologies for getting your name wrong!
The bar service is excellent as always!"}
{"text":"The Clever Koi provided us a delicious culinary journey. The ambiance on the patio was great and the service was prompt and helpful. The food isn't so much Asian fusion as it is just creative and original (for you picky Asian fusion reviewers).  The biggest surprise was the tasty cocktails."}
{"text":"If I could give 4.5 stars, I would. The only qualm I have with this place is their steamed buns aren't really bau, but more like a steamed bau taco. It's delicious, but not exactly what I was expecting. The food is always fresh and perfectly prepared. Great Asian fusion with a southwestern twist."}
{"text":"Had a great time at this Asian fusion restaurant in cenpho with friends last night! The patio was perfect for a March evening, and wasn't loud like I thought it would be for being on a busy street. We all started with cocktails and I ordered the sloe burn (I love bourbon/whiskey) - it was really good. Very complex flavors and a little spice at the end. I'd recommend it if you're a fan of anything in the whiskey category.

We each ordered a steamed bun and I had the Peking duck - the bun is a little more taco-esque than your typical steam bun, but the meat was tender and the sauce that came with it is awesome. My husband had the catfish and it was my favorite. The pineapple tartar sauce on it is awesome. 

We all ended up getting noodles for our main dishes. I got the pork ramen. I am a novice ramen connoisseur but do enjoy a good bowl of ramen - it was very good. The kicker is that it's topped with the sexiest slow poached egg I've ever seen in my life, just oozy and silky perfect with the broth and the pork. The kale in the ramen didn't really work for me, it had an acidic taste to it that I wasn't in to, but the noodles were cooked well and the pork/bacon was delicious. The broth was nice, not super heavy. I tried the curry that my husband got and it was awesome - great spicy flavor with coconut and peppers. Those udon noodles were on point. 

All in all, we had a good time. I would go back for happy hour, they have good drink specials and appetizers!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I came here for the first time with my boyfriend and we were so flustered with the menu because we wanted to order EVERYTHING. Which my boyfriend actually did - he tried all of the steamed buns, the calamari, the soup, and the poke. I had the fried rice with chicken and we basically ate until we couldn't eat anymore, and then tried to continue eating. Everything was amazing, and fresh, and SO unique. I can't compare it to any other restaurant here because there is nothing like it!

We also had great drinks, and the service was amazing. David is on his game. He knows the restaurant, the food, and the drinks inside and out. He makes you feel like he is your friend and is not just trying to sell you on anything. I honestly thought he was the owner because of how knowledgeable he is. 

Not only will we be going back for the food, but also to see David!

PS - this is a great place for a date night. The outside patio was perfect."}
{"text":"Excellence in food and customer service!! I love their pork belly steamed buns, the ramen and the dumplings. BUT let me tell you that they are living proof that someone cares about their customers. Uber Eats gave me a very angry driver who called and very curtly exclaims \"where are you?!\" As his greeting. When he hands me my food, it's only one bag and we had a fairly considerable order, so I let the driver know food was missing after I checked the bag. He gets irritated with me and then tells me I need to call the restaurant. I realized the uber eats guys was just angry at the world so I called the restaurant. They immediately got me to a manager because they had seen the driver had left the rest of the order there. While I'm talking to the manager the uber driver is yelling at me to update my uber request. I explain to the Manager who I learn is one of the owners what is going on with the driver. The owner asked where I lived and drove the rest of the order to my house. You want to support this business - high quality food and service!!"}
{"text":"Favorite new restaurant! The quality of food and the service is outstanding. My husband and I took advantage of the \"It Takes Two\" special, two entrées and four cocktails for 50 bucks. What a deal! The Grilled Chilean Salmon, delicious and the Bees Knees cocktail so very very tasty. Love Natalie, super nice, great server. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. We drive from gilbert just to eat there.  I haven't found a single dish on the menu that I haven't liked.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre.  I had chicken katsu--the chicken was cooked to death.  The music is way too loud.  The service is absolutely horrible.  The bar is incredibly slow; twenty minutes for two drinks.  The server was rude and she forgot to enter part of our order.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Came at the last minute of happy hour, good timing! We ordered the smoked pig face dumpling, kimchi tarter tots, Peking duck bum, spicy pork ramen, roasted pork ramen, kimchi duck fried rice. I like the dumpling very much! It's juicy, tender and special. Also the fried rice and spicy pork ramen, very delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for the first time last night as part of our effort to support local restaurants during the summer.  I had read about their \"It Takes Two\" special on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, which sounded like a good deal (two rice or noodle dishes plus a bottle of wine for $55).  We arrived around 5:30 and it was almost empty, although it was maybe 1/4 full by the time we left.  The server said they're still getting good crowds on Friday and Saturday nights through the summer but appreciate the weeknight business.

My husband ordered the crispy pineapple duck and I ordered the house pad thai with lemongrass chicken (they charged me $5 extra for the chicken without mentioning it up front, I thought it would be included in the special price but oh well).  The pineapple duck was spectacular and would easily have cost twice its $16 price tag elsewhere.  My husband said the accompanying harissa rice and mushroom cake was outstanding and after one bite I had to agree.

My pad thai was very good but maybe a tad sweet for me.  The lemongrass chicken really helped the dish because the chicken (which didn't taste like lemongrass at all) was sprinkled with togarashi, a Japanese spicy chili powder. The server did ask me if that was OK so I presume you could order the chicken without it, but I really liked it.  Next time I'll order their satay pad thai which is similar but with a spicy peanut sauce instead of the slightly sweet soy sauce.

The \"It Takes Two\" promotion saved us $9, or 14% off our bill, but only because we chose the most expensive bottle of wine on the list at $36.  If you choose a less expensive bottle it may not save you much so do the math.

We'll definitely be back.  Outstanding quality, a really interesting menu, and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Beautiful, hip and vibrant. Excellent service. Fusion is delicious and nice mixes give you some exciting options. Very reasonable prices allow you to try a variety of things.  Tried buns, rice, ramen, Bahn mi and all fabulous.  Everyone liked everything we ordered.  Must try."}
{"text":"First time at this place and it was amazing. Different food for your pallet. The wings and the pork ramen paired up nicely with my dragoon IPA. They don't have an official kids menu but our server provided a quick \"unofficial\" list, my son went with chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"Great little spot on Central!  

My husband and I have been meaning to try it for a while now and we finally made it in last night.  It was 8pm on a Saturday so needless to say they were busy.  But we were seated right away at the bar so we didn't have a wait.  Our bartender/server was awesome and I'm glad we made the choice to be seated at the bar.

I had the \"hey bartender\" and my drink ended up being a tasty concoction of gin, basil, and lemony goodness.

My husband had the grapefruit soda and that was really refreshing with the right balance of tart and sweet.

We loved our shrimp and chive dumplings so much that we ordered another round of dumplings and tried the pig face dumplings.  Also good!

We split the pork ramen and it was pretty good, as well.  A little salty but I'd prefer the broth be a little savory instead of bland.

Overall the service, food and energy were great.  Can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"Dinner for 4 on a Saturday night. We got there a bit early and the place was starting to fill up. The decor and the ambiance are tip-top. The menu is very unique. An eclectic mix of Asian dishes. We started off with two sets of dumplings - Smoked Pig Face and Smoked Bok Choy. Both very delicious. The pig is definitely the moist, fatty dark meat. I love it, but perhaps not for all. The Bok Choy turned out to be very flavorful. Lots of spice to it as well. 

We had a mix of entrees. Scallop special (only 4 scallops, but well done), Mission Chinese Kung Pao Pastrami (spicy and delectable), Kimchi Fried Rice (a bit salty, but well done), and the Roasted Pork Noodles (very tasty). 

I think that the only thing lacking was the service. It started off good, but went downhill fast. That said, I will chalk it up to the place being brand new when we dined there. 

N*joy"}
{"text":"Service that kind of just brushes you off. Waited forever for everything. Too pricey for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Amazing service the chefs are amazing...ramen is beyond on point. It's got a hipster/new age feeling. It's amazing truly amazing."}
{"text":"What a perfect place in Downtown Gilbert! It is so nice to have a wonderful place to eat and a fantastic craft cocktail bar. It really is the all around best place in a Gilbert right now. Happy to have them there! Plus the owners are so incredibly nice."}
{"text":"New favorite! The ambiance, music, staff and oh my the food was perfect! The prices won't hurt your wallet too and the happy hour was a huge plus as well. Would definitely come back here next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Hubby and I went on a last minute date here.  The steam buns were delish!!!  My husband tried the chicken wings, they were good but not at all spicy.  We both had broth bowls, they were delish!  My pork belly ramen was amazing!!  I can not wait to come eat her again!  Plus the service was awesome!  The manager noticed I was cold and came over to me and said he turned off the circulator.  He then later checked on me to be sure I warmed up.  This was customer service at its finest!!!  We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal here...only downside was a bit slow service ...but the food is the bomb!
Best soft shell crab ever...great fried calamari...ramen noodles w pork/chicken...veggie noodles...great cocktails...definitely worth the trip..."}
{"text":"My wife and I truly enjoy this restaurant!  Great good, drinks and the friendliest staff of any restaurant in Phoenix.  Clearly management has done and is doing a great job training and educating the staff about how to treat customers.  We ate at Clever Koi last night with friends and had another great meal with great service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now (two dinners and lunch), each time hoping to understand better all the rave reviews - I really want to love this restaurant, but unfortunately the some of the food, although ambitious, misses its mark.

The kitchen seemed to be having problems bringing out food during both dinner occasions I was there. I wouldn't have minded this, if the food was spot on. I recommend making a booking if you want to go for dinner.

The wait staff are attentive and polite, and each time I have visited, I have felt welcome.


** FIRST VISIT: Dinner **

The first time I visited with 2 other people, we had to wait for our table for quite a while - the outdoor area was closed since it had been raining earlier that day. I ordered a \"riding the pine\" cocktail while we waited, which made the wait quite yummy. After pushing over an hour waiting and watching tables of people waiting for food that wasn't coming out, we asked one of the waitstaff if it would be ok to sit outside, and she said if we didn't mind that it was a little chilly outside, they could set a table for us. Yay! The seats were dry and it wasn't too cold outside.

I ordered the tempura catfish steamed bun for an appetizer, and the filling was delicious, fresh and vibrant. The tart and sweet apples and the sauce complemented the fried catfish well. The steamed bun however had a very dense, chewy and flat texture. A far cry from the fluffy steamed buns I have had at Ippudo.

I ordered a pork ramen for my main, and another cocktail. The pork belly topping was cooked really well - melt in your mouth and fall apart. Unfortunately the ramen egg was overcooked on all 3 ramens our table ordered - the yolk was set. The noodles were ok, but nothing very special. The most disappointing thing about the ramen was the soup - it was kind of grainy, insipid and lacking seasoning. I can see what the dish was aiming for, but it missed its mark.

My second cocktail never arrived, even though I asked waitstaff about it again after I had finished my main course.

To finish, our table shared some fritters for dessert, and they were quite nice. The miso caramel was a nice idea, but I couldn't taste the miso.


** SECOND VISIT: Dinner **

The second time I visited with friends again - a table of 5. We booked in advance this time to avoid having to wait for a table. We were seated promptly and ordered a few appetizers to share.

The tart was delicious but small, I couldn't fault it with its flaky pastry and rich filling. I would go back just for this appetizer alone.

The pig face dumplings were also nice, however they were lacking filling. Filling and folding dumpling skins can be challenging though, and as someone with a PhD in Dumpling Cooking, I can understand that not everyone can make plump dumplings.

The steamed pork belly bun - filling was good, melt in your mouth, but the bun was still the same - chewy, flat and kind of hard.

For my main, I had a duck curry. It was nice and spicy, but the curry was lacking any flavor depth. I was looking forward to this, but I was really disappointed.

** THIRD VISIT: Lunch **

I had a pork ramen again for lunch. I thought I would give it another go, since I thought that maybe the kitchen was under pressure during dinner service. Lunch time wasn't very busy, and our ramens came out quickly.

The pork belly seemed a bit dry this time. The egg was overcooked - yolk was set again, and the broth was once again non-impactful. Granted, I am a bit of a ramen freak, and I was really, really hoping Clever Koi would be come my go-to in Phoenix, but this is not the case.

Someone, for the love of noodles, please make good ramen in Phoenix so I don't have to travel for my fix!

If this is the \"Best of Phoenix\", then I feel like the culinary scene in Phoenix is in a really sad state.

Some of the menu items are fantastic (alright, so I've only found the tart), but most of the ones I have eaten so far have seemed to have a great vision, but missed out completely on execution.

I will be back to try again, because as I said, I really, really want to love this restaurant, and I am hoping that they will improve on what they have."}
{"text":"I am from the Bay Area where we are almost snobbish about places that try to have a hip foodie vibe. So imagine my surprise when I not only found a place outside of NorCal that pulls it off extremely well, but it's in Phoenix AZ no less. Place has a really cool vibe good drink menu and really good food menu. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went here with my family recently. Great atmosphere, a little loud for conversation with the high volume music. Service was great! We got the Ahi chips which had amazing flavor, defiantly the winner of the meal! Also got the Pork Ramen- was just good... In my opinion not worth returning for dinner with many other great restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Clever indeed.

Buns
Noodles
Brains

Good effort being made in bringing mission street food to the desert."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place that has not been here too long. But, I am happy they are here. For so long Phoenix downtown has had nothing. So it is great to now have some cool choices around town.
First off the Restrooms in here are delightful. There are 2, they are large, and nice and clean.
The parking is a little tricky if you don't know the neighborhood. Best parking is around the back. You have to turn down a side street to get to it. Follow the parking for George and Dragon, that makes it easier.

I met a friend here for lunch. While I had parked around the back, she does not know the area that well and ended up parking far away.  But, we came after the lunch crowd, I think it was around 2 so it was not very busy.
However ,we did wait a long time for our check and such. Anyway, when I first arrived there was a delightful young man who was so helpful and friendly. I told him I had never been before. So he was kind enough to explain everything to me. About ordering ,where did I want to sit, the food, etc.
However, he was through with his shift so we had a different waiter. Still good though.
Lunch is a reasonable price. However, I do not recommend if you are in a hurry. Such as your lunch break. It takes a long time to get your food.
For lunch all you can get is Noodle bowls. Though you have many noodles types to choose from , as well as different meats or Shrimp. As well as you may add vegetables to it as well as your own type of broth.
It was very good, and everything tasted extremely fresh!
I am really looking forward to checking them out for dinner. 

Very beautiful inside as well. Simple ,yet stunning. I liked it a lot!"}
{"text":"D-Lish!      If you are looking for the best Ramen in the known Universe.... do yourself a favor & get to the Clever Koi ASAP."}
{"text":"Amazing. Clever Koi never ceases to amaze me. Sit at the bar and ask the bartenders what to order - you can't go wrong with the chow mein, last time I added shrimp and it was enough food for three meals. Don't miss the pork belly steamed bun, get one to start your meal and for dessert! LOVE the crispy pineapple duck. 
Oh and the cocktails...this place rocks. One of the best restaurants in AZ."}
{"text":"Lunch special is to die for. Each ingredient is fresh and unique. The kim chi is out of this world. Over medium hard boiled egg was the piece de resistance. The ginger shrub is refreshing, i suggest adding a few muttled sugar cubes to add a balance the fermentation note. I thoroughly enjoyed my expierience."}
{"text":"Definately a place you have to try.  Great happy hour and dinner. How I grade it:

Parking - C

Service - A

Drinks - B

{"text":"Clever Koi was recommended by my hotel conceirge and it was a great suggestion. I had the pork Ramen and my dinner partner had the Pork Bah Mi sandwich, both were outstanding. The Ramen has chunks of pork and pieces of pork belly and the broth was rich and tasty, it was decadent to say the least. The sandwich was good as well and comes with a fresh fruity salad that would be great on a home summer day. You can get the fries with It if that is more to your liking. The only negative with the sandwich is there wasn't enough dikan, carrots and cucumber to our liking.  I tried a draft of the Strawberry Blonde on tap and it was phenomenal, they have a wide variety of cocktails. The next time I visit I will be sure to find time to visit Clever Koi again!"}
{"text":"The Clever Koi literally is as good as it gets.  Bar program, service, food, ambiance, happy hour, location all on point.  These guys are doing it right and have created easily one of the best spots in PHX.  If you've been on the fence about a visit, go ahead and hop off the fence and get in here.  Look out Gilbert, the second location in downtown Gilbert is going to take the food scene out there to the next level."}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting better :) I love their cocktails and the build your on bowl of noodles. My favorite are the chilled green tea noodles ( great in the summer time). Looking forward to trying the hot bowls now that the weather is turning! Great food!"}
{"text":"Great all around experience. The place is quaint, the music cool, great lighting. You definitely need to order the dumplings, best I ever had. The sticky buns are also great. Entrees are sizeable. Also, save room for the Nutella dessert....wow!"}
{"text":"I'm a little torn on this place.  My fiancee really enjoyed it, but to me it was ok.  I am a little bias cause I do come from a Asian family and we owned a family restaurant, so this Asian fusion is a little confusing to me.  The place had a nice environment and \"trendy\" but it's still all about the food.  I thought for the prices of the food, they sure do give very small portions.  If I told my parent's I paid over 14.00 for ramen, they would probably slap me!  I much rather have a big bowl of Pho that costs me 8 bucks, than the ramen that I had at Clever Koi. I ordered the Pork Ramen, which had two peices of pork belly, an egg, and some veggies, with very little ramen. The good thing is most of the food was flavorful and delicious, but just very small portions. 

The service was good, we sat in the patio, cause inside seating was over 45 minutes long!  So we sat outside with another couple.  We split couple of appetizzers and buns, and each order a ramen dish.  With couple of drinks, the bill came out to over 120.00.

The sad part is when we left, I told my lady I am still hungry, not just a little but a lot.  I felt I could eat another meal, so on the way home we stopped and picked up a Sonoran Dog and called it a night.

Overall, this place was pretty good and had flavorful food, but for those prices, I rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place, since I've heard a lot of good things about it & was delighted to see that it lived up to the hype! Upon walking in we were greeted warmly by the staff & seated immediately. We ordered some cocktails that were amazing! I ordered the Martinez which is like an old fashion but made with gin...this is a must try! My friends all enjoyed their cocktails that they ordered & I can attest to that, since I sampled everyone's beverage in our table. 

For food I ordered the mushroom ramen, which was to die for! I rarely order ramen, but plan to order it from here every chance I get. The broth is not too thick and very flavorful! My friends all ordered meat dishes, which they loved but I couldn't sample since I don't eat meat. 

The ambiance is fantastic, portions are great, brilliant food & cocktails, plus great customer service. I plan on returning very soon!"}
{"text":"What a super funky place. Fusion food is tough to do right and Clever Koi knows what they're doing! Everything we had on the shared plates menu was stellar, easy to share, and perfectly portioned for our group of 4 ladies. The fried chicken and maple syrup buns were a favorite, as well as the ramen and other noodle dishes. Between the four of us we shared about 5 plates and ended up leaving some food behind as we were too stuffed to go on.

Cocktails were also fabulous! I was so glad to see sipping vinegars (aka shrubs) on the menu. Opting out of cocktails for one round, I just asked if I could have a shrub and soda. One of the absolute best shrubs I've ever had was their cucumber shrub. Wowza! A little of it topped off with soda water and a cucumber slice and I was in heaven. I could drink this every single day for the rest of my life! It was sweet, refreshing, and had just a kick of that sour vinegar flavor that's oh so yummy. A follow up drink was a ginger shrub and soda and it was lovely as well. Definitely something everyone visiting this restaurant should try.

So with great food, great drinks, and great company - our trip was just what I needed after a long flight to Phoenix. Topping off the experience there was fantastic service and an incredible hip, sexy, welcoming atmosphere. 

The restaurant has a bit of a fishbowl feel as the walls are all windows, but it makes for an extremely trendy, extremely beautiful evening. Great spot for ladies night, date night, or to impress coworkers. This was so unexpected for me and not what I envisioned as a place that would exist in Phoenix. This city is so cool and I'm so glad to have been able to visit and come to a spot like this to make my trip perfect."}
{"text":"What a find!!! Visiting Phoenix for business and to see family. Went to my \"go to\" Yelp to find a high-rated restaurant for dinner near our hotel. Oh course, several popped up, but Clever Koi had what we were looking for in a meal.
Service was excellent (shout out to RaeAnne) as she gave us a nice rundown of drinks and her favorite dishes. Being somewhat ADHD myself, squirrel, I did not pay attention to all of the suggestions. My wife however did. My wife ordered the XO Noodles and I could not believe all of the flavors that hit you from that dish - one of the best dishes I have tasted!!! Sous Chef Luis, incredible job!
This place is a must when visiting Phoenix. Loved it so much, I would even brave the heat of summer to eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"We have been to The Clever Koi several times.   So, this review really is overdue.

We both really like the massaman udon, tandoori chicken, edamame fritters, calamari, Peking duck, and pig face dumplings here, and the mixed drinks are yummy, too.

I really like the Negroni and Sidecar, but the boyfriend usually just sticks with a beer.

The service is really good, and the space is open, clean, and welcoming.

The prices are pretty reasonable, too."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice but the food was overpriced and poor-tasting. Got the Lemon Pepper Ramen and the Pad Thai. The chicken thigh overwhelmed the broth and there was no depth of flavor. The pickled leeks were the only thing that set this dish apart from being lemony chicken noodle soup. As for the Pad Thai, there was a distinct lack of any kind of flavor. There was no spice to the dish and it was lacking other essential elements one would typically expect to find in Pad Thai. The little bit of sauce included in the dish was nearly tasteless. At Clever Koi, you're paying for a modern facade without substance. There are two much better options, with delicious food and great service, in the same building as this place. They are also almost half of the price."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Clever koi. I had high hopes, but it was not to be.
The food was very bland. Let's start with the pork belly steam buns, they were just okay, nothing special or to make us want them again. The octopus was the best thing of the night. We had the massaman curry noodles and the spicy seafood. Spicy seafood was not spicy, it very bland and missing flavor. As was the curry, I know it's not as spicy as other curry, but I expected some flavor. It may have been an off night. But we will not return based upon our first visit."}
{"text":"Soooo....Here I am with some time to kill on a Saturday afternoon. From the Happy Hour menu we select: He - Koi Burger; Me - Soft Shell Crab Po' Boy and just when I thought it could not get any better...IT DID!

All I can say is that they finessed the hell out of the soft-shell crab. It was extreme delicacy in acton. Absolutely perfect. THE best $10 (he) ever spent! 

Honorable mention to the Koi Burger, (it was juicy and so flavorful) and the Old Fashion (perfection even without a Luxardo cherry).

Asian fusion has never been so beautiful."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I stopped in here having never been and were simply delighted. 
 The menu is really fun, you can choose to have ramen, rice, and many other options for your base, if having soup even choose your broth, then your protein, and lastly your veggies. 
 I ordered a ramen bowl, pork broth, duck, and a couple veggies. My friend had a ramen bowl as well with steak and veggies. She also ordered the chicken and waffle app which was small for the price, one piece, but she enjoyed it.
 Overall the food was amazing, the duck was dark meat, broth was full of flavor, and the bowl was huge however the price is a bit much for what your getting and it took 30 min or so to receive our entree however I was informed everything is made fresh including the meats so that may be part of it."}
{"text":"this is a pretty cool place went in for lunch the menu seems small but it is fully custom to what you want there all bowls pick ether rice or noodles and the style that you want them pick your meat then you veggies I had two stir-fry with duck and bokechoe mushrooms the duck was grate not greasy like duck can be everything blend just right did the Ramon that was just OK I didn't like the broth to much it should if been chicken but it was really white now the goat cheese dumpling are yummy fries cheese can't beat it server was grate friendly and on top of everything defenley be back"}
{"text":"Our second time here and again it was amazing. Very intricate veggies and meats. The grilled octopus soup was fantastic. Best of all they have a drink mixologist ."}
{"text":"Three friends and I enjoyed a fantastic evening out earlier this week at The Clever Koi. We started at the bar where I abandoned my usual libations and ordered The Enabler, which is described as hickory-infused 12 year old whisky, grilled lemon juice, lapsang maple syrup and burlesque bitters. It was so good that I had another. 

For dinner, the four of us decided to just order a ton of stuff and share family style. Armed with our chopsticks, we were reminiscent of a family dinner in which the fastest eaters get to, well, eat. You snooze, you lose! Luckily we ordered in phases, so we continually had food coming. We thought at first we were insane for ordering so much, but we managed to pretty much polish our plates.

Here's what we had:

5 stars -- The beet salad with mizuna, shaved cucumber, pickled ginger, tempura bean curd and lemongrass vinaigrette.  

5 stars -- The salt and pepper shrimp with scallops and XO sauce.

5 stars -- The long beans with crispy duck tongue and XO aioli.

Steamed Bun: Schreiner's lop chong with daikon slaw and spicy Japanese mustard (can't star it because I didn't get a bite!!)

5 stars -- Smoked \"pig face\" dumplings with kimchi and pickled peppers.

5 stars -- Kimchi duck fried rice

5 stars -- Massaman udon noodles with red curry, roasted duck, fingerling potatoes, pickled peppers, peanuts and crispy cilantro.  (MY FAVORITE OF THE NIGHT!!)

5 stars -- Ramen with roasted pork, house bacon, pickled mustard greens, shiitake mushrooms, bean sprouts and soft-boiled egg.

The ONLY thing we had that we didn't love was the \"Mission Chinese\" Kung Pao Pastrami. It just didn't do it for us, and everything else was SO out of this world, that it paled in comparison.


Go, go, go to The Clever Koi!"}
{"text":"Amazing, ever changing menu. Wicked awesome drinks and phenomenal service (David is the best!)."}
{"text":"First off the staff is amazing! They work as a team and everyone was providing us a memorable experience. The hostess made jokes with our son, the bus boy relayed messages and 2 waiters ensured we were taken care of. We drove up from Tucson and got in late and our son was so tired. They brought out his food first, and then we needed to have our order to go. Multiple people checked in with us and made sure we were satisfied throughout the process. 
Then menu was scary at first, my wife is a picky eater and everything looked exotic. We got the Chow Mein with shrimp and the Lemon Chicken Yakisoba. AMAZING! My wife couldn't put her chopsticks down and didn't know what she liked more. I couldn't have been happier. The location is a cool setup, the only complaint is the English Pub next door. Drunk guys in the parking lot talking about jumping us wasn't the best but we survived unscathed."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and has a nice vibe. They have signature drinks that's are made with lots of love. I had the Spicy Noodles and they were so good and lived up to the spice."}
{"text":"Clever Koi recently opened up in downtown Gilbert and we thought we would give it a try. The decor is very clean, sleek and modern- staying on the darker side of the neutral color pallet. Service was prompt and our waitress was pleasant.  I was expecting some pretty amazing food given the prices, but was surprisingly disappointed in the meat preparation. We ordered the Pork Belly Steamed Buns as an appetizer. (side note: I've only had Pork Belly a few other times, at The Wilderness Brewing Company in the form of their Pork Belly Sliders, which are INCREDIBLE ) 
The pork belly was hard, not crunchy on the outside and dry and chewy inside. Given that the only other pork belly I've had was crispy and succulent and juicy, I was pretty bummed. I asked our waitress if this was the norm and she said yes. The chef must have overheard my question because he sent out another plate of them, saying that these were much more fresh, but it was still chewy and dry . For the main course I ordered (according to our waitress) the most popular dish on the menu, Lemon Pepper Chicken Ramen. I was in love, the flavors of daikon, pickled leeks and lemon jam were amazing, but again, when it came to the chicken, it was inedible. Since it was soaking in this heavenly broth it brought it was going to be juicy and full of flavor, instead it was super hard and dry, like it was an afterthought. I feel like if I'm ordering a main course or an appetizer with meat, it's kind of the star of the show and should blow my tastebuds away, but this wasn't the case here unfortunately. I would love to give them another try, but they've gotta figure out their meat situation. Not sure if it was just that particular chef, or the preparation in general, but I would not order a meat dish there again. Overall it was an OK experience. Again, the broth in my dish was FANTASTIC, so if they got some chicken in there that was plump and juicy it'd be a home run. I feel like it was a bit pricy for what was offered."}
{"text":"Wonderful outdoor seating away from the downtown GILBERT traffic. The Bhan Mi sandwich was filled with flavor without being too spicy. Shredded pork, crusty bread and a side chopped Asian salad. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Love this place and love the outdoor entrance from the back parking lot! Very organic.  

My husband and I both tried their pork belly ramen and their pork belly steamed bun... the steamed bun is a must try!!! You definitely won't regret it. The ramen was good and the broth was pretty great, but what I would change is removing the kimchi and changing the fried pork belly to a steamed pork belly that melts in your mouth. The kimchi just didn't belong. That would have made their ramen the best ramen I've ever had if those changes were made. I also tried their Thai basil cocktail (Thai basil, gin, lime juice and simple syrup) and it's probably the best Thai basil cocktail I've ever had. 

Great and friendly service-- we'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the service! Great atmosphere.  Took my daughter here for brunch and will definitely be back for dinner."}
{"text":"This has been our go to place when we are lazy to cook and we want something savory and just wanna hangout. Tonight was another great experienced, flavorful food and good service as always.

The Calamari Fries tonight was a bit chewy but the tase was spectacular. They gave us another plate of Calamari Fries (for FREE) and it was so much better. Our ultimate favorite here is their Kimchi Fried rice with pork belly and it taste heavenly.

We always love to come here because of the food and the people who works here."}
{"text":"Clever Koi is in my top 5 favorite restaurants to eat at. The food is delicious and I crave the Duck Curry now that I live in another state! I love the ahi crudo tuna chips, seasonal vegetable plates, spicy wings, and crab po boy! They specialize in creating unique and beautiful cocktails as well. Beyond the food, the atmosphere is wonderful and you can tell that the owners carefully planned the decor down to every little detail. If you are in Gilbert or Downtown Phoenix, Clever Koi should be your first choice to visit for a meal! Support local business!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here because Uber Eats launched yesterday and they had a $10 off coupon off your first order (UBEREATS). I got the Green Tea Soba Noodles with duck, bok choy, kimchi and egg. It was a cold dish and so delicious. Everything was seasoned so well and was of great quality. It was also a filling portion."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night...the place was packed.  We had a wait of about 30 mins so grabbed some cocktails from the bar, standing room only.  Since I was really thirsty and slammed my delicious IPA too quickly, I had to avail myself of the facilities.  Tables are super close together, not much aisle space.  On my way down the aisle to the loo, I felt like Super Mario...I had to dodge the servers, move out of the way or else be trampled over.  They weren't budging, so I had to.  Who is the customer here?!  Ok, no biggie, whatev.  When I was done, the table was ready.  Again, very close together.  I know waaaaaaay too much about the two tables next to us now.  Anyway, we sat down.  And waited.  And waited, even though there was a woman waiting on the tables on either side of us.  We looked at each other like, \"WTF, are we in the Twilight Zone and no one can see us?\"  Finally got her attention after actually contemplating whether we should just get up and leave.  She seemed almost bothered but brought us menus.  Another wait.  She eventually came to get our orders.  We had questions, she answered them.  The food came and it was DELICIOUS!!  It almost made up for the bad service, BUT, even though that food was really, really good, there were ingredients not listed, everything just wasn't the same as the menu.  It would have been the last straw if it didn't taste so good. 

C'mon, treat a customer with a little respect, acknowledge their presence with a little less disdain and put all ingredients of the dish on the menu (some people have food allergies).  

The delicious food saved it from one star."}
{"text":"This place is great!! I accidentally called in a take out order to the wrong location and the staff was super kind and over accommodating!  They expedited the order and took great care of me!  We have eaten here previously and the food and drinks are super tasty!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This Asian fusion restaurant blew me away!

We came in for lunch for our first time and tried out their tasty little build-your-own-bowl options. First off, the place is hip and beautifully-decorated, cozy yet chic. It's a very nice spot in Phoenix. It's set up with an open-kitchen look, so it's fun to watch the chef-owners cooking the food with fresh ingredients and lively attitudes. The food was AMAZING. BEST pork belly steamed bun I've ever had in my life--it was with just the right amount of sauce and crispy, flavorful, and crackling with tasty fat! I also had the stir fry chow mein with steak. They know how to cook their meat here! Their steak is amazing: tender and juicy and bursting with flavor. My partner had their dashi broth with noodles and it was light, refreshing, and unique. These guys know how to make sophisticated and inventive flavor profiles that are still respectful of their traditional bases and still reminiscent of that delicious Asian comfort food we all know and love. I will come here again and again; this is our new favorite restaurant in Phoenix!

(Pro-tip: come from weekday lunch! It's PACKED during dinner time and a reservation is highly recommended! Also very loud in the evenings!)"}
{"text":"Very yummy hip spot in downtown Gilbert! I had a super yummy lemongrass swizzle drink! It was good!! We also had the soft shell crab bun, and pork belly bun!! I'm usually not a huge fan of pork belly but this little gem was super good!! Definitely a cool spot to check out!!"}
{"text":"Five stars. Yes five. The food is fantastic, thoughtful, creative... 

We started things out with the Wood Fired Grill Plate, which was a yummy selection of roasted toasted char-tastic veggies along with a respectable portion of spiced shrimp and chicken. It's not often you order an \"appetizer\" in a restaurant these days for $15 or less, and think to yourself it would make a great entree... very good with the plumb sauce and a pristine vodka martini, shaken not stirred.

Next came the perfectly spiced ramen in a few different flavors: The Spicy Seafood Hot Pot, the Lemon Pepper Chicken, and the Cauliflower ramen in a coconut base. All were exceptionally tasty with deep rich flavors that go well beyond simple spice. We love vietnamese \"pho\" and classic ramen bowls, and these will not disappoint. The broth in all three was so complex and enlightening, it was almost like eating something with a soul... (but not in a creepy Rush Limbaugh kind of way!)

And the fact these guys do it right AND do it gluten free means I don't have to ride the moist-wipe train the \"morning after\", or be embarrassed by the inevitable facial hives that pop up when exposed to gluten... (Think Woogie from Something About Mary). These are things us Celiacs really appreciate! 

Butt I digress...

Mixology is not something to be trifled with if you are an amateur or don't know the difference between a vodka martini straight up & one with a twist. Rest assured these guys (and gals) are pros. 

I began with an orange bitters gin martini, graduated to an old fashioned with Filipino cane sugar and (cinnamon?) and finished with a drink that sounded like it was named after some guys jizz. It was noisy, so I'm not exactly sure... but (not) surprisingly the drink was excellent. It was so good in fact, I \"finished\" with three more and it inspired me to compose a new song about the occasion...which I \"rapped\" to David who was blown away by my incredible talent. Talk about a happy ending...

There's one thing I'd like to point out about the drinks: They are hand crafted and it shows! Ok, there's a second thing too: they are reasonably priced and ... Crap there's a third thing: they're also strong enough to achieve their purpose, which in this case was a good ole' fashioned buzz.

Now, on to the crew. Nick, Mike, David, girl who \"had to meet me\", girl who took our picture, and 2nd owner bartender extraordinaire (didn't get his name, but we share a common love of the Michael Jordan hair-do and strong drinks):

All the folks who work here are fun. And by fun I mean people who know how to have a good time, and at the same time provide some of the best service of any hip place in the valley we've been to...(and if you saw my Buddha you'd believe we've been to most of them).

Amazingly, they remembered us from our first visit over a month ago, and each of the crew came over to say hello and chat. Apparently We made quite an impression...?Meanwhile our drinks were never empty, the food seemed to come out in two shakes of a lambs tail (bravo to Chef and the kitchen staff!) and we didn't even have to pay tax on the alcohol. Is that a new thing?

David is a walking piece of art, with all kinds of bitchin tattoos (yea, bitchin is so 80's, I know). And he has the hair of Jesus (as it was depicted in all the oil paintings of Jesus I gazed upon in our Mormon church when I was a kid). Mike, what can we say about Mike? He's quirky and sarcastic, yet has a sweet edge to him that makes you want to hang out or go snow-boarding. And Nick... The 163 pound man with the cutest baby-girl on earth who tickled my 300 pound Buddha and got away with it. Imagine my surprise when I found out he's one of the owners. LOL.


Seriously this is an all around great place to eat filled with interesting characters who are passionate about life and good food, and we'll be going back again and again. We had an absolute blast!

Eat here, or you suck."}
{"text":"Great time celebrating my friends anniversary...1st time there, great food, cool atmosphere and nice ppl. Pork belly buns are what's going to bring me back..."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight. Tried the Chow Mein with lemongrass chicken and the Duck Curry ...so flavorful; just the right amount of spices. We'll be back to try more delicious sounding dishes on this menu.  The staff was wonderfully accommodating to our needs."}
{"text":"The place is really cool. And that's about all I can say about it wasn't impressed with the food wasn't impressed with the service. just another place where people can go and be pretentious."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place out since my friend recommended it, i was so excited to go. The ambiance is great, the decor is great, the service is great. 

I ordered the Tuna Chips and they were amazing, i love ahi tuna! I also had a pork belly steamed bun which was the sole reason i went to this restaurant, that was so so so delicious! And for my main meal i had the pork ramen. And that when i got sad. It needed more flavor. It was bland but it looked pretty. I was expecting it to be amazing, to be absolutely delicious. I'd been anticipating the broth to be the best. But it wasnt it was just alright. So i was a tad bit disappointed but its ok! Maybe i just need to give it another try with another dish."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant.  We are recently huge fans of the Parlor, so thought that finally eating some Chinese food (that's not dim sum) since we moved to Phoenix was called for.  Plus, Central Phoenix is our home.

We tried a variety of things.  Spring roll with beef neck, steamed buns with duck/lamb pastrami, dumplings with pork & kimchi, the mission chinese kung pao and fried rice with bbq pork.  The spring roll was good, glad I tried it, probably wouldn't eat it again (the sauce was weird).  Steamed buns were amazing and delicious and I want more of them.  Dumplings were ok, interesting, spicy, probably wouldn't order again.  Husband loved his kung pao (I want to order it next time) and my fried rice was smokey and full of flavor and veggies and pork (as opposed to the mostly rice version of most chinese take out).

Cocktails.  I would come here just for the drinks.  Oh my goodness they were amazing.  Sloe burn is at the top of the list, first recommendation to anyone.  One of the best cocktails I've ever tried.  Temperance tamer was just what I needed tonight, which was a little sweet and a little sour (grapefruit, yum).

This is a place we will certainly come back to.  We could also see ourselves just coming in for drinks and steamed buns.  That would be delicious."}
{"text":"I have only been once to the Clever Koi but my husband and I can't wait to go back and share this place with friends and visitors to Phoenix!  The food was AMAZING!!  It was so refreshing to go some place like no other!  The atmosphere was very cool and the staff was wonderful."}
{"text":"I love the look and feel of this place -it's very cozy and laid back, though a bit small.  They do have outside seating though.  This is just a side note though - who cares about the decor?  Let's talk about the food...

Came with a friend, so we shared :

Octopus Spring Roll - It was blah.  It's definitely over priced at $10 for 5 tiny pieces and lacked substance.  If you know what a spring roll looks like - well, they basically cut it up into 5 pieces.  The \"nuoc cham\"/ fish sauce for dipping had an okay flavor - but it lacked the necessary garlic, chili, and lime used in authentic fish sauce.  There was barely any octopus in the roll, accompanied with some lettuce. The octopus itself had a weird smokey flavor to it.  I probably won't order this one again.  

Duck Steamed Bun - Overall flavor was good, but not amazing.  The sauce that is smeared inside the bun compliments the duck well, but it was very minimal - and as someone said in another review, a side of sauce should definitely accompany the bun.  The duck had very little texture, as it was too soft and fatty.  The duck skin should be crispy to compliment the softness of the bun.  

Kimchi Fried Rice with BBQ pork - I have mixed feelings about this one, in a sense that it definitely doesn't taste like traditional kimchi fried rice I've had at Korean restaurants, but for something that doesn't taste like what it's supposed to taste like, it's not bad.  I love that the texture wasn't too greasy, and the seasoning was good.  They added enough kimchi, so it didn't overpower the dish.  My only gripe is that it doesn't come with an egg over easy.  That's like eating waffles without syrup.

I didn't hate this place, but I'm not sure if I like it either...  I'd probably come back to try their noodle entrees though."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends on a Saturday night.  Crowded but we got a table in 15 minutes.  Nice décor, nice table settings, drinks were good, service was OK for a busy night. 

We samples 4 or 5 dishes.  All were tasty, well prepared, and there was attention to detail in the kitchen.  Things tasted good and looked good.  Enjoyable.

Would definitely go back. Recommended."}
{"text":"Service was great! My glass was never empty.   That being said, everything else wasn't great. We walked in and they told us it would be an hour wait for a table inside, when there were multiple tables available. So outside we sat. The calamari was a mix of crispy and soggy.  But it wasn't terrible. The rest of the food was just ok. Nothing I would really care to experience again.  The overall feel of the place was pretentious. I feel like the place is trying too hard."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the service was great and the cocktail list had something for everyone. 

Asian food is my favorite and this place was awesome. A lot of flavors I hadn't had before, I loved every item we ordered."}
{"text":"GREAT SPOT! Friendly staff, awesome food, and very good ambiance, make up a great recipe for a night out. They have unique dishes that you just won't find anywhere else. Clever Koi has a full bar with many drinks as unique as their food. Great place to go on First Friday because it is facing the light rail. My Wife and I loved our dinner."}
{"text":"Best food & service. My brunch meal was $10 (fresh cheddar, egg & homemade duck sausage biscuit with sweet potato haystack) , food for the kids was $5 with good sized portions and they even have $3 mini French press coffee & house made green or red Sriracha. The chef came out to talk to us and thanked us for coming in. They also gave Scarlett a See's chocolate sucker when we left. I wish I could come back here every Saturday. Xoxo"}
{"text":"Super excited to have this type of restaurant in Phoenix! the menu consists of dumplings, steam buns, noodle dishes, hot pots and several yummy appetizers. They also have a great drink menu with some awesome cocktails. We ended up getting there before 6 for an AWESOME happy hour! The HH menu has probably 5 or 6 food items and discounted drinks. We started with the salt and pepper shrimp, that were awesome! They even do it right and serve the crispy shrimp head! We also got the house wings that were in this sweet vinegar type sauce. Pretty good, I like my wings crispier but they were solid.. I had a lamb pastrami steam bun with mustard greens that was out of this world! Super flavorful, great texture. Just killer.  I also got my meal frm the HH  menu, a huge steaming awesome bowl of Ramen for $5!!! it had grilled bbq pork, sprouts, musrhooms, greens and a healthy potion of noodles topped off with an over easy egg. Great bowl of ramen. I wll say the noodles were a tad underdone and I found the broth a bit heavy, but still a mega legit bowl of ramen. My wife ordered the seafood hot pot. She wasn't a huge fan due to the spice factor, but it was a well put together dish. My fave part of her dish was this awesome fish cake! I had this deink called teh enabler, easily one of my fave drink in Phoenix right now. It had house smoked whiskey, maple honey and some bitters. Just a great smokey whiskey drink. Wifey had a glass of wine. the atmosphere is great, the food is great and they have a solid happy hour. to top it off, the service was perfect. I'll for sure be back to try the dumplings, more noodle dishes and several glasses of whiskey!"}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem downtown Gilbert. They have an Asian fusion going on that is simply delicious. Fast service great staff. And my favorite is their pork belly buns!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Came here with the family for the first time and was it busy! Luckily for us there was stable absolve right away so we didn't have to wait. The service was very attentive and didn't let a thing slip. We got a few appetizers to try and I heard no complaints from anyone. We tried the two different dumplings, calamari  to split. I can't remember what everyone got for their main course but I got the pork ramen which was delicious. Even though we didn't get any drinks we did look over the menu have a few we want to try the next time."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I would recommend the burger and the steam buns, the truly best things here are the craft drinks.killer happy hour and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Super high quality handcrafted drinks and top notch food combined with a great atmosphere.  Service is excellent and just love the overall feel.  We had the pot roast dumplings as an appetizer and they are to-die for.  Also have tried the wood grilled short rib dish, pork ramen, cauliflower ramen, and the wood fired grill plate.  Soooo good!  Can't go wrong here.  Will be back many times over."}
{"text":"The food is good.  The ramen is the best thing on the menu... In my opinion.

I'm a single woman that goes out by myself often so the friendliness of the bartender and staff is really the most important thing to me.  I suspect that chris served me at the bar and he was attentive without being overbearing.  I would have given them 5 stars had he introduced himself though...

It was Josh, he remembered me and introduced himself so I revised to 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about what a great experience we had at Clever Koi. We went as a big group and there was a lot of us. First, the food was amazing, everything is unique and delicious. Highly recommend the sriracha wings, and the soft shell crab steamed buns, the mushroom dumplings and the tuna chips. Amazing. The drinks were wonderful- had something called the drink formerly known as spritz, and it was awesome- strawberry aperol and sauvignon blanc, and lemon juice. Delicious.

We were one of those groups that of course paid with about five or six different credit cards, and the staff was so patient with us and accommodating. I wish I could remember our server's name, but she was wonderful, and funny, and thoughtful. They had a new menu and it is worth a trip. Nothing beats the service there. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"I thought my boyfriend was going to brake out singing when he bit into pork belly bun. The food was extraordinary. Started with small plate of vegetable pancake with a wasabi dip - to die for. Loved homemade grapefruit soda. Our server Mike like all our servers on this trip were generous with making recommendations of other places to try and things to do.I won't go into detail about our other plates but we were extremely satisfied, just go and try it for yourself."}
{"text":"I never leave reviews but after going to Clever Koi this weekend I just had too. I will start by saying that the drinks and ambiance  were very good. The vibe there is really cool. The FOOD on the other hand.... Was terrible. I wanted to like this place so badly. Growing up in Hawaii I have spent most of my life eating Japanese food. I have had Japanese food all over the country and in japan. Out of the 7 dishes we ordered only one person liked their meal. My ramen was so bad I couldn't finish it....and considering that the portion was very small that says a lot. I left hungry. I told the waitress that I did not enjoy the meal and that most of us at the table were very disappointed...she said \"oh I'm sorry. That's too bad.\" And that was it. I've been working in service for over 15 years. I was very surprised at that response and that no one came over to ask about our experience or even to offer a drink or dessert. I didn't want or expect a comp of my meal but considering the reviews and that this place is newer I would think they would have tried to turn around a table of 7s opinion. If you want good drinks and ambiance...go. If you want great Japanese food I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Best salads in the East Valley! I took my mom here while she was visiting from Michigan, and we came back 3 more times in 2 weeks! Excellent service, tasty craft cocktails (try the Gimlet), and you're doing yourself a huge disservice if you do not try the chopped salad with shrimp!"}
{"text":"Went here on Father's Day...staff was attentive and friendly, they frequently checked on us and answered our every question. Definitely enjoyed the Kimchi Fried Rice I ordered it wasn't spicy and very tasty"}
{"text":"My Husband and I went for our last date night before baby at the Clever Koi back in August. In fact, it was the night before Baby Boy arrived (not due to the food I assure you). The inside of the restaurant is very modern, a bit tight, so the tables are somewhat close together, but it really is well done. The patio looked nice as well, but we opted to sit inside due to the heat and the fact I was carrying a fully \"cooked\" baby.

Anyway, on to the food... everything was delicious and unique. I don't think I've ever had food quite like the Clever Koi. The Hubs and I shared a noodle bowl and some small plates. As I recall, the noodle bowl was very spicy, so that was slightly tough for me, but the Hubs thought it was amazing. The small plates we had were so good, pig face dumplings were top notch. 

Can't wait to get back to the Clever Koi at some point, hopefully soon. This is a \"hot spot\" and the food surely backs up the hype."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!!! The steamed buns were amazing and quite creative. Everyone on the staff from hostess to busser were attentive and helpful. The Peking duck dumpling is a must. Will definitely be a regular spot from here on out."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, elegant, classy, quiet. Great place for date night, catching up with friends, or after work get together. Would be nice if they had more vegetarian options. But they did accommodate me and the noodles were delicious! Awesome and creative cocktails too! Free parking in the lot right behind, conveniently located close to downtown Phoenix, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"WENT HERE for a girls night out and I loved it we all did. Great service everyone was chill yet professional and the food is so yummy. One of my top places"}
{"text":"Service was great, our waiter Dave was attentive. The food was so tasty, I wish there was one on San Diego. They the pig head dumpling and the Korean short rib Nd rice plate. Awesome flavors and ambiance"}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new Asian Fusion spot opening in the Gilbert Heritage District and decided to try it with the fam. The menu has a good variety of options and they have a daily happy hour from 3-6pm. Since we arrived during happy hour we tried the zesty noodles and duck fat sriracha wings off the HH menu and paired them with the short rib dumplings off the regular menu. The flavors were outstanding, the service was impeccable, the value was excellent and the decor was modern and relaxed. We felt comfortable dining here with our two kids who were 2 and 4 at the time, and will feel great dining here again as a couple! They also have an excellent selection of beers and other beverages! Keep up the good work guys! You are definitely a favorite in my book!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks! Service was great. We came on the early end of Sunday evening and sat on the patio. Happy hour is daily 11-6 and available anywhere. My husband and I got pork ramen and our kids split 2 chicken noodles. We also got the duck fat sriracha  wings and the trio of steamed buns. 

I loved the steam buns and the wings. The kids noodles were delicious as well. To me the ramen was missing some type of flavor just can't pinpoint it. Adding their house sriracha helped give it some more flavor but if I went back I'd probably do noodle or a sandwich. 

Drinks were great! We got two off the happy hour and then split the scorpion which was pretty but sweet!

Overall great experience and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Went for happy hour last week.  The atmosphere is chill and the service was good. We had the wood grilled vegetables, the pork belly Ramen, chicken wings,  and bbq pork appetizers.  Drinks did take a while to come to the table but everything tasted delicious and the price was great!"}
{"text":"Shocked I hadn't already reviewed them! This is easily one of my favorite local restaurants! I hate to use the word, \"hip\" because I know it sounds corny, but they pretty much are! Decor is great, food is even better! I usually order the Kimchi Fried Rice + extra kimchi, & then of course I sample whatever anyone else at my table has ordered. I think this is more a place for the adventurous diners. If you're expecting authentic Asian food, this is not it. If you want a flavorful, unique dish that pulls from different cultures, look no further! The staff are friendly & chill, & usually quite attractive! They tend to be consistently busy & don't have a ton of space so I highly recommend making a reservation, even for dinner during the week it's helpful."}
{"text":"Came here after a long day of hiking - causal dress is totally fine. They have happy hour everyday so that was amazing - we literally ordered everything on the menu. 

The spicy duck fat wings were really disappointing but other that everything was yummmm! Tuna tartar was fresh with wasabi seasoning, the ramen had nice broth and noodles were the right level of chewiness. Galbi was a bit sweet but that's how I like mine. Fried rice was recommended to us - it was the least flavorful but it could be also we were super full already. 

And the cocktails were the bomb!! We tried 2-3 each. Just delicious!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and they make some killer cocktails. Definitely recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"Had the pork belly ramen to go. Service was good, people up front were very nice despite the \"just-opened jitters.\" I was very pleasantly surprised to find the noodles super well cooked, even after sitting in the to-go container. Pork belly and all the added things were super good. My problem was with the broth, which was disappointing. I had to add my own fish sauce and soy for a little bit of flavour, it was pretty bland. Perhaps they were just working out some kinks? Will try again for sure, and hope for a little stronger flavour next time!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  This place has the best drink menu in Gilbert & an awesome daily happy hour.  The food is excellent (I highly recommend the Pork Ramen & the steamed buns).  The owner is extremely hands on & the staff is very friendly.  One of my go to spots!"}
{"text":"Front to back side to side. Still very impressed with everything. From the grilled lemon juice cocktail all the way to a mole short rib ( thank you for not letting this trend die). And of course all points in between. Buns and dumplings, and wait; hummus that each aspect was a flavor profile all to itself. 

Not for the timid; and expect a long wait."}
{"text":"Took the Cruisers 2 checkout the Clever Koi on opening day. We arrived to a warm and friendly greeting with lots of smiles and pretty faces. We sat on the outdoor patio which is just awesome. It's nice that it's removed from Gilbert Road so you don't get a lot of the traffic noise and Chaos that's out there. The Furnishings and vibe to the place are well done and the food and menu are absolutely Sublime. The bee's knees cocktail was bueno and it was nice to see some mother Road Brewery on tap.

I could explore this menu for months never getting bored with the amazing variety that they have and interesting ingredients. I had the pork Ramen as well as the soft shell crab sandwich with a couple of rounds of nice drinks and the bill came out to less than most chain restaurants for happy hour.

I was most impressed at how good the service was on opening day they really were well-prepared and knocked it out of the park.  A well oiled machine on day one - impressive!

CK is likely to be one of my favs if this holds up to my experience yesterday.  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and friendly waitress and staff but food could be better. The only thing I really enjoyed was the pork belly bun."}
{"text":"The food here was great. The reason I am giving them three stars is because my drink service was the worst I've experienced in years.

I arrived before my friend and was promptly seated. A server (and I'm saying \"a\" because it seemed that practically every employee served us at some point, likely contributing to the problem) came and took my drink order. My friend arrived about 5-10 minutes later, and he placed his drink order and received his first. I asked about my drink (to server #2) and she went to check on it, returning to say she could not find the ticket for it and asked what I had ordered. She returned a few minutes later with my drink and said it was on the house. Again, the food was great (we shared the chicken wings and each had the burger and fries, all on happy hour) and when I ordered a second of the same drink, they returned with a different drink. I'm not sure which server we were on by then, but I flagged one down, and told her it was the wrong drink. She asked if I did not like it, so I think she thought I had ordered it and did not care for it. I informed her I did not change my drink and had ordered the same drink as the first. She returned a few minutes later with the correct drink. 

Then, a different server brought us two more of my drinks for the inconvenience. However, my friend had been drinking something completely different and did not like what I was drinking at all. So, it seemed to be a nice gesture, but poorly executed. With all the \"on the house\" drinks, the bill was still incorrect, but they rectified it. 

I would return to this restaurant because the food is unique and flavorful. It's a small space, so maybe they do not assign servers to tables. But, with the mix-ups and not knowing who our server actually was, it got frustrating at times."}
{"text":"Dropped in with my baby girl late on a Friday.  Kitchen was about 30 minutes from closing, but they were still very happy to seat and serve us. The staff is excellent!  They know their food and communicate with their customers very well.

The food is fantastic!  Not traditional by any means, but very fresh and tasty.  Had the Kimchee Fried Rice with Chicken.  It was so good, I ordered a second one to go.  My daughter wasn't feeling very adventurous, so we asked if we could order the Koi Burger off the HH menu.  They were happy to oblige and wow, am I glad they did.  If you are fortunate enough to be in the area between 3-6 p.m. you will be thrilled with this menu item. It is cooked perfectly, garnished with Kimchee, and killer mayo.  Then the topper....served on a full size King's Hawaiian bun!  Man it is soooo good! We are planning a return visit very soon.

Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Downtown Gilbert has changed so much in a great way, and it really is becoming our go-to place for dinners! Clever Koi has a low key atmosphere, perfect for an intimate date night or with a small group of friends. My husband & I have dined here a couple of times and were pleased with our experiences.

From the menu items we've tried, we liked the Steamed Buns the best, especially the Soft Shell Crab one! The Soft Shell Crab is fried to be very light & crispy and it's topped with the right amount of toppings. They have a good number of shareable options along with full-sized entrees. My husband got the Grilled Octopus Curry & really enjoyed it. He said the Octopus was cooked well & the curry had great flavor!

They offer options for Happy Hour & many drinks as well! Overall, one of our options to return to in the future. I think my favorite part is getting multiple small dishes & sharing!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The Paloma my girlfriend got was tasty and my IPA went well with my burger and my duck curry. There were a few small issues but it was quickly handled by Nick the owner, it's important to focus on how issues are handled than the issues themselves (because they will always pop up). RaeAnn was very nice and had great recommendations. Overall I'd say it was worth the $80.00 and I will continue being a regular. Best old fashion in town btw!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Hidden gem in Phoenix. Great vibe, staff is great, and food is exceptional! We had the Pork Ramen, and it was unreal. I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"So first off, this place has excellent dumplings. We got the pork ones, and just super flavorful and not crunchy, just the right consistency, topped with flavorful vegetables.

I ordered a pork belly ramen - thinking mistakenly that this meant tonkatsu. Nope, no tonkatsu ramen. The pork ramen comes out with roasted palm hearts, kimchi, roasted pork belly, green onions and a soft boiled egg garnished with Togarashi. The egg yolk was already broken on mine which is usually not a big deal. But my problem was the broth.

Totally utterly flavorless broth. My partner noticeably saw my face go from yay I'm gonna get some ramen to sad face in record time. It needed salt too which for a pork ramen is kind of ludicrous. I liked the consistency of the noodles though, so yay for that. The pork in the ramen was ok, though it could've been a bit more tender. My partner's lemon grass chicken ramen was also weak in the broth area though the other flavors came together a bit better overall in that one.

I will definitely check this place out for their other dishes. The decor is awesome and has great ambiance and wait staff are friendly, but the ramen failed this city, as The Arrow would say."}
{"text":"I hardly EVER give 5 stars but this place knocked it out of the park  :)

I met up with a good friend recently to catch up over cocktails and try the bao.  I love those things and was excited to try them 

We started out with the chicken wings and they were super tasty ..sticky, meaty, and sweet & spicy.  We polished them off quickly, saving room for the next course 

There are several versions of bao.  We took the plunge and decided to order them ALL!  All were delicious and many were vegetarian.  My favorite is the crispy tofu.   Soooooo yummy!

We couldn't leave without dessert....We ordered the bananas foster, Asian style   Again, completely delicious!

The cocktails were nicely crafted and fairly priced.  The building and actual restaurant are nicely lit and make great use of space 

The bottom line is that the food is cravable, the service is great, and  the location is close by  so try it, you'll like it!!"}
{"text":"Our first time this evening and definitely not our last! We started with the pork belly buns - ummmm could have eaten them ALL night long! I had the pork belly ramen - BEST food I ever ate! My husband had the spicy seafood hot pot - I dipped my spoon into the broth, filled with deliciousness! It has quickly become the best restaurant I've ever eaten at! The staff was great! The restaurant itself had a wonderful ambiance. Cannot wait to go back! The broth still lingering in my mouth...not sure if I'll brush my teeth tonight! Ha! Ha!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails, food and atmosphere. Definitely happy that this place is in Phoenix. Super hip spot! Service is always great too. There is one male server than is definitely always running his butt off, even during lunch time. You can tell that they take pride in their jobs!"}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews, I'm feeling like the odd man out by not giving a higher rating.  Our experience was good, but not amazing. Arrived around 3 on a Saturday which was just in time for Happy Hour. Along with some cocktails, our little group sampled the duck fat sriracha wings, short rib dumplings, rabbit gyoza, pork belly steamed bun, and chicken and waffle steamed bun. The steamed buns are not what you'd traditionally think of and more like tacos in appearance.  The wings were tasty, but lacked heat (despite the name)...by far, the dumplings were the best of the items but a little pricey at 4 for $9 and maybe a bite and a half in size; however both were super flavorful and delicious. Oh and I tried the Sour Times cocktail which was not only beautiful in appearance but also quite yummy.  

We then ordered entrees - spicy seafood hot pot, ramen, and chow mein.  I'm unsure why, but it took a super long time to get our food and the restaurant was not at all busy. Everyone enjoyed their dishes, but again, nothing spectacular. I had the hot pot and it was definitely spicy, but full of flavor and a ton of seafood. I thought the grilled calamari steak was a nice twist. 

Overall, we liked it, but felt it was pricey for what you get. Definitely recommend going during happy hour to take advantage of the deals."}
{"text":"Menu does not adequately describe the dishes. Dishes are ok, not over the top. Portion are smaller than most \"small plate\" dishes. Service is fantastic!  If getting a reservation and want outside, make sure to request it. Music is loud! Can hear every tables conversation next to you as they yell over the music."}
{"text":"Thank God for Hipster Restraunteurs! Terrific dining experience. Walked in, immediately impressed with the decor. Open kitchen, so I made sure I sat where I could watch what was happening. They chef cooking the proteins was multi-tasking but you could tell he was on top of the six or seven things he had cooking. Also had a great view of the bar and was stunned. After I got past the fact that I could only identify about a third of the labels on the bottles, I then noticed that there were a whole buch of garnishes and syrups and herbs, all neatly arranged in different bottles and jars, just waiting for the bartender to make something delicious.
Since we were there for lunch, we only had the option to make a bowl. I went for Ramen with Pork broth, while Muffin opted for Rice. I added duck, pork belly, egg and mushrooms to mine. She went crazy and got steak, egg, shrimp, bok choy and broccoli.
Everything was delicious. You could taste the care that they put into each ingredient. Touch of lemon when finishing the bok choy, check. Homemade sriacha, check.
Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"We parked behind the restaurant which was easy to spot. The place was very clean & nicely designed. Our server was pretty & hella friendly. My wife ordered the pork ramen bowl & I ordered pork belly steam buns to start our appetite right & pad Thai to humble my stomach. Overall The food was good & the service was great!"}
{"text":"We came there for a special July 4th event on their patio.  $50/person included a dinner and 2 drinks.  I called in advance to see if they could accommodate vegans.  They told us yes.  We had two out of town guests from DC with us.  The setting is perfect, especially for the fireworks which would happen later on that evening.  As the restaurant started to fill up the service definitely was lacking.  The vegan meal was nothing more than a small plate of grilled veggies with slaw and beans.  We did speak to the manager and they made it up by giving us a discount on the $50/person tab.  
The ambience was good but based on this experience, I am not sure we would come back based on the quality of the food and the service."}
{"text":"Love the vibe. Bartenders and wait staff is super knowledgeable. Sydney was our waitress and she was definitely on point.
I recommend the pot roast dumplings and the lemon pepper chicken noodle soup.
The flavors were balanced and intricate, and I would certainly come here again if I lived here. Great cocktails.
The ONLY pet peeve: I could taste the dish detergent on the drinks and the water (my husband couldn't). But the cocktail list was inventive and I'd love to try them all!
On a side note, I liked the wall art in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend on a double date excited for some good Asian cuisine. As much as I enjoyed the atmosphere and service, the chow mein seemed to be too salty and the drinks too sweet (I ordered the pineapple cocktail with whipped egg whites on top). The main reason I probably won't return will be because of the price of me and my dates' average meals. If I'm going to splurge, I want a A+ meal, where as this was around a B/ B-. 

All in all, average (yet pricey) food with good service."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it did not disappoint! We had many people checking on us and making sure everything was going great. The food was awesome! I just had to say, Raeann was the sweetest and did something really kind for us that made me appreciate life today. Sometimes a little kindness goes a long way and she made my night after a rough week. I definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I flew into Phoenix and all we wanted was pool time and delicious food and drinks. We didn't find Clever Koi until our last night and it was definitely the best part of our trip. From the food, to the staff, the atmosphere... this place hits the nail on the head. I mean seriously, what a beautiful space! 

I ordered the Uptown (drink) and was not only impressed with how descriptive the bartender was in helping me choose it, but also how ridiculously smooth it was. I mean seriously, if you're reading this and dig a little gin, get the Uptown. 

We were seated swiftly and had such a first-rate dinner, both of our servers were amazing, accommodating, and so kind (seriously, give them a raise they were the best). Shout out to Zach + Nick for being great sports when we forced them outside to help us take a group photo! Just know we were deeply impressed with every bit of our experience at Clever - even beyond the food, you have orchestrated a beautiful team and place to dine, you should be proud.

Keep up the hard work, it's paying off!"}
{"text":"Went back to the Clever Koi recently before going to the Symphony. We needed to have quick service as we were time crunched. Our server was really nice and made everything come out quickly for us. I love the ambiance and the food was (as always) amazing! We both had the ramen (he had pork belly, I had shrimp) both were delicious. We also had a cocktail. I had the Almost Always Bad News (Tiki drink with bitters), which was very strong and good! I mix the mint sprig into it and it adds so much more flavor! We love this place!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday night for dinner. We were greeting warmly and we asked if we can be seated outside. The service was awesome, the kids menu was great, and the patio area was very clean. I ordered the ramen which was delicious I would definitely get it again. My boyfriend got the duck which I tried for the first time and it was really good.  Thank you clever koi we will be back to enjoy more food."}
{"text":"I love this place proably one of my top 5 of all time. Steamed buns are amazing the bar tenders are awesome people and I had the privilege of meeting the owners and they are awesome people as well.I recommend this to any and every one"}
{"text":"The food at this place is no match for the attitude that comes with it........the pho is 'duh-llll...."}
{"text":"Coming from a woman to loves Asian fusion and ramen, I thoroughly enjoyed this spot. Only problem was the service which was VERY slow! Read my pro and con list for more info: 

Pros:
-The Asian-fusion food is delicious and healthy for the most part. I got vegetarian ramen noodles with tofu, which I loved and would order again! 
-Very modern and trendy atmosphere
-Wonderful feng shui - the light, decorations, and greenery uplift me 
-Convenient parking  
-Reasonable prices 

Cons:
-Service was slow and unapproachable  
-Food took very long
-Very busy during lunch -- was hard to get a table, be served, and get our food"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great beverage options. Service was fantastic as well.  Their vegetarian options are off the charts.  If it's available get the cauliflower ramen."}
{"text":"5 star restaurant hands down. Best bartender in Phoenix. (Alex) good food and amazing appetizers. ....................................smiling. ........................................
Great drinks and very cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to give the Clever Koi at least 4 stars because the good qualities were REALLY good.  Unfortunately the negative things have to be shared and for that I left it at a 3 star.  I will be back, hopefully within the month to hopefully see improvement.  I think the biggest thing is that this is a brand new restaurant so this is their chance to WOW their customers and I was missing a little of the WOW factor.  The food, hands down is fantastic...definately a 5 star.  We tried all of the steamed buns, a rice dish and a noodle dish and all were amazing and left us wanting to try more.  They are known for their dumplings so I wanted to try the dumplings.  I wanted to order one of each and try all 4.  \"we don't do that\" was the response I received.  You have to order 4 of one kind.  Maybe it's just me but if a customer came in to try a specific thing, I would probably take a minute to ask my boss if we can give them what they want.  You think?  This was the beginning of the bad customer service we received.  Never asked about another round of drinks and we had to find someone to get our bill for us.  I will go back and I hope that round 2 earns the extra star!"}
{"text":"Well fed and slightly buzzed...

I have given this place three times to disappoint me and they have failed, miserably, all three times. This place just rocks. I have had the seafood pot which was out of this world, the chicken pot which killed it with the jelly, and tonight I found my signature dish and cocktail the kimchi rice bowl with chicken and shrimp with the \"word is bond\" martini...kicked my ass in flavor, portion, and buzz potential. All thanks to Alexandria with the on point recommendations. This place is a great date night or a cool spot to come chill with that special someone.  You simply must go and go again. #newloyalcustomer"}
{"text":"The clever koi is hands down my favorite restaurant of all time.

Their cocktail lineup is bananas.

Definitely try the kimchi fried rice with Duck"}
{"text":"Great dinner of small plates. Highlights: hands down, the pork bun, and octopus. I adore pork buns, and these hold their own against the best I've ever had. We also had a softshell crab bun, and while it was very tasty, it was completely outshone by the pork. The octopus was remarkable, perfectly cooked with a wonderful texture, and very tasty. The wings were the weakest dish, pretty boring, which is hard to understand given the excellence of the other dishes. We had the warm sticky date cake for dessert, and it was delicious. Cocktails were good, not mind-blowing, but certainly worth trying. Service was friendly and fun. Looking forward to my next visit. That was a great pork bun."}
{"text":"It was a bit overpriced, but the food &service was well worth it. I loved all the decor &ambience. It's definitely a place I would come back &bring my friends/family to. I just wish it opened a lot sooner than 4pm.."}
{"text":"Below average at best. Tried the pork belly ramen. Huge pork belly fan as one can seldom mess it up..... This one holds that distinction. The undercooked egg in the ramen sounds good on paper but made the average ramen a tad bit worse. Tried the lychee cocktail - that was so so but it was in a glass small enough where 2 sips for this $10 drink would do the job. Never going back."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for happy hour on a Friday right after work. 

It is new, right next door to George and Dragon. 
The patio faces central but has some really nice long wooden benches with cushions and small tables. 

Inside has a great long bar area with table seating as well. Plus this open fireplace that they use for cooking the meats. We were watching as they cook this meat and let the juices drip onto whatever they were cooking underneath it. 
Mouth watering!

I had the ramen noodle soup and a beer. The soup was amazing. They drop a egg in there with some pork and other goodies. On happy hour it's only like $5, come on that's awesome. 

I'm definitely going to come back for more."}
{"text":"To make it short and sweet, I was not impressed. Cost me an arm and a leg to get some ramen. I wouldn't be complaining if it was worth it, but it was too bland for my tastes. I had to keep adding soy sauce, chili paste, & Siracha to make it taste like something. Won't be coming back. The restaurant has a nice feel to it though."}
{"text":"This place has some very unique flavor combinations for Asian fusion. There was hints of Asian flavors that reminded me of home but also some new aromas that complimented the food really well. Many of the dishes are spicy, which I didn't realized until after we got it to our table. So if your sensitive to spice then you may want to check with you waiter. In order to get a tasting of different dishes we ordered several plates and shared them all. We started off with a tempura catfish steamed bun, very light in flavor but had a very good sauce. We then tried the rabbit gyoza and pig face dumplings. The rabbit gyoza was greasy but the pickled carrots were a really good compliment with them - making them taste fantastic. The pig face dumplings were very good, it had some of their house made red siracha which made them a little spicy. We also tried the wok fried brussel sprouts, which were interesting because the first few bites reminded me of an Asian wok fried vegetable but them the peppery smoky aftertaste makes me forget I'm having brussel sprouts. We also had the duck curry, which for our taste was too spicy and we weren't able to get past bite number two. It started out very delicious but the heat from the spice was too much and numbing that I couldn't taste anything after. 

Lastly, we tried a cranberry cake with sesame basil ice cream, which delicious. The basil and sesame were very light and complimented the warm sweet cake. Overall, everything was tasty but wished we would've know which dishes were spicy and which were not."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. This place needs 10 stars, not 5.

1st time here... and it will not be the last.

My girlfriend, baby, and myself decided to try this out after  looking for a nice ramen place. Based on the excellent reviews, why not? So we decided for a lunch visit.

You do have to park around back, the only thing bad about this place. But it is just a minor inconvenience. 

I was greeted by 1 of the four owners, Nick C., and was directed to a table. We were seated and Nick promptly gave us water and ordered drinks. I ordered a hot tea (which I cannot remember what is was called, but it was fantastic), and girlfriend ordered a coke.

My menu for the lunch order was a \"build your own bowl\". I decided on a Ramen Noodle bowl, with pork broth. I chose the pork belly as the protein with carrots/mushrooms/bok choy as the vegetables. The extras I added were the eggs and kimchi. Too good. Mouth watering, like heaven having a party in my mouth. I honestly cannot wait until I come here again. 

The girlfriend ordered a pork chow mein which wasn't too bad. She preferred my ramen over her chow mein, but hers was still tasty. 

Due to this being a trendy, hip place I did see a lot of different drinks and such which I hope to experience one day."}
{"text":"My family and I were road tripping from California and driving through Arizona and found this little Ramen restaurant. The best ramen I have ever had! The restaurant is a lovely modernistic Asian spin and is beautiful in its own unique way. The Pork belly ramen noodle soup is a spectacular taste of heaven I cannot express how much I loved this ramen, the broth wasn't too salty and let the other ingredients of the soup speak for itself. The real star of the ramen was of course the pork belly, which the deep fry but the pork was still tender and super flavorful. The pork bun was also very good, the bun was very fluffy and the sauce the pork came with was the right amount of Asian Hoisin. The staff were amazing as they made sure that your eating experience was the upmost best. Nick was especially very nice and welcomed us and made sure the food was perfect. I cannot wait for our next trip to Phoenix just so I can get another bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"Tried their bao bun taco last night at the Phoenix night market & that was highlight of the night, tbh. It was absolutely delicious with fried pork belly, hoisin & peanuts. Definitely checking this place out next time I'm downtown."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service to complete another experience at The Clever Koi! Chilled green tea noodle was great and other usual offerings that never disappoint. Thank guys again!"}
{"text":"I am a huge Clever Koi fan. The food is always great. 

I've come here about 7or 8 times over the last several years. 

Today's experience was no exception - superior kitchen. 

However we used to enjoy the service as well. Great servers who had personality, tattoos, and guided our dining experience making great recommendations. Fabulous. 

Today was a little different. They have moved to a team serving style. Therefore we met no less than six people all of whom wanted to take our order, bring us things, or see if everything was ok. Which meant that we had to tell several people that we had already ordered, the guy who did take our order looked confused/perturbed that no one had already had taken our order (he looked around and said, I guess I'll take your order) and people we had not met actually delivered our food. A little chaotic. NBD. No fewer than three people said, \"first time here?\"

When we received our food (sensational Banh Mi, not very authentic but great), one of our waiters asked if we wanted a second round of drinks - we said \"sure.\"

Fifteen to twenty minutes later, as we finished our light meal, the drinks - a beer and a glass of wine arrived. We'd already written them off as MIA. Again, NBD. 

At this point the nice young woman in a great Guns N Roses UK t-shirt looked confused and said \"but it's been poured.\"  I still don't understand the relevance of the comment. I said it was too late, we were leaving and I'd like my check. She apologized and got a manager. Here is the odd thing - all six or so people wanted to apologize so we had a parade of people I had barely met offering free drinks, one offered to comp the meal, and a profusion of \"we're so sorry!\"  I didn't want a fuss or an apology. I just didn't want to pay for drinks that arrived too late to enjoy them with our food. I refused the offer of a free meal. I just wanted to leave after this \"tsunami of apology.\" They made a big deal out of a tiny incident. 

Conclusion - I'm sure a team serving approach works well somewhere. However this was bad. 

I'm sure the server who put in the drink order went about his duties. I'm sure the bartender might have gotten busy. I'm also sure that if the waiter was watching the tables he owned, he would have bugged the bartender and said, \"I need those drinks now!\"  However it was obvious no one had primary ownership of my table so if there is a hiccup in the service no one sees it. Finally, it seemed to take a committee to comp those last drinks. \"Service By Committee\" was ineffective and heavy handed."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the Gilbert community ! Would highly recommend the Duck Curry and Pork belly buns . We received our food quickly and our waiter was very helpful when explaining our food and drink options ! We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating area, with some road noise, with a modern Asian flair interior. Fantastic choices on the menu and the only place I've found in Phoenix offering fresh steamed bao! Food was very tasty and artfully presented. My guest had a slight mishap with her main dish, but the friendly waitress immediately resolved it and presented a new, fresh dish. If it weren't for this minor bump in the road, Clever Koi would get 5 Stars from me!"}
{"text":"Went here with family and was initially really excited to see an Asian restaurant with \"comfort food\" items, but was highly disappointed with the end result. Very pricey, food flavors weren't very appetizing, and a bit too shi-shi for us. $4 for a single steamed bun - bun was very good but a little pork belly goes a long way (also had it on the ramen, so it was way too much fat for our palates). My husband bitterly complained that he got the \"child's plate\" version of the ramen because there were hardly any noodles. I thought the rice bowl would be more like a mixed fried rice, but the food was all separated. Broth for the ramen was somewhat bland; they have housemade siracha to spice it up, but it shouldn't need it. Short rib dumplings were good but 4 for $9 is high (we had to get two orders and ask for bowls as we were sharing with our group). Pad Thai was not really Pad Thai as we were hoping and was quite greasy.

Service was very good, but otherwise we won't be back and won't recommend it. I don't think the food was terrible, but it just wasn't our style and we left feeling hungry after paying way more than we anticipated for our meal."}
{"text":"I've been on the search for a worthy pork ramen since I've moved from hawaii to the desert four years ago..I've been disappointed over and over again but not last night.  Last night I was an ecstatic girl! Pork belly ramen was BOMB and it was on happyy hour menu for $8. Win-win-win. We also had cream of shiitake soup which was the most amazing mushroom soup ever and my husband had their \"surf n turf\" hamachi n steak. ...phenomenal! Service was exceptional.  The bar was so pretty but I was too dehydrated to have alcohol :)"}
{"text":"Have been here Few times and cocktails and food never disappoint! Yummy cocktails and mocktail drinks made by coolest barista ! My recommendations are tuna chips\" Must order\", pig face dumplings (\"scary name but amazing taste if you love spicy\"), pork belly buns and pineapple duck rice (\"delicious\")! I recommend ramen and XO yakisoba noodles. My favorite spot to sit is by the bar cause I can watch barista make his crafted cocktails , it's quite an art! The only thing I did not enjoy as much is dessert. Although each plate looks esthetically pretty , bth desserts I have tasted were plain and too fried (they were not in menu but I posted a picture of one) Not my favorite. Also, quick recommendation for staff working by grill to smile a little! Definitely recommend this place for cocktails and food! Will be there soon to taste ramen!"}
{"text":"Fantastic menu and amazing service. Great for drinks with friends and also a nice date night. The small plates along with the steamed buns and dumplings and specialty cocktails were a perfect combination!"}
{"text":"My wife suggested we try this place and I am glad she did. The waitress was very knowledgeable with the entire menu. Everything we tried was fantastic-with the grilled Octopus and Brussels Sprouts tasting amazing. We were seated next to one of the owners parents and received great information on the evolution of the imenu and we got to meet their son Gerrad co-owner. We highly recommend this place as well to anyone that enjoys Asian culturally inspired food."}
{"text":"Food is okay. They offer a variety of bowls. I don't find it interesting. You can get a bowl at Kyoto Bowl or Yoshi bowl for less and tastier. Great ambiance and nice restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here on a date with my boyfriend who was visiting, and we had a good time! It's more casual than I had expected, but the food was very good. We both ordered the ramen, which was decent. It needed more flavor than the tons of hot sauce we both had to add (made in house and VERY good). I'd like to go back and try something new."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous time at Clever Koi! The ambiance is super modern and refreshing. Kenzie was awesome and definitely added to the experience. She recommended some great drinks and dishes including the \"tart\" which was absolutely delicious. All the food we tried was memorable and we will be back again!"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely amazing! I have been here twice now to be satisfied both times. I went for the calamari apps and their curry dish. highly recommended. I will def be coming back again in the near future."}
{"text":"It's really hard to find a restaurant in Arizona worthy of a review, I must say everything is absolutely amazing from the friendly staff to the well thought food menu and amazing craft drinks. I recommend the dumpling and the calamari fries. I've recommended this place to everyone I know, and the ones that have tried it feel the same way. Clever Koi is truly a hidden gem in the Desert."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and the service was great. Unfortunately, their food is overrated. We had black bean pancakes, rabbit dumplings, chicken and waffle steamed buns, and pad tai. Nothing overly impressed us. The steamed buns are not buns at all. They are basically trendy tacos. The pad tai was greasy. The dumplings were missing flavor and the pancakes were so so. They made a great cocktail but we just were not impressed with the food."}
{"text":"I have been to The Clever Koi 3 times now, the first two times it was, well, ok.  This last time was terrible, with the exception of the server.  My girl friend and I went in at 6:45 on Saturday.  They were very busy and quoted us an hour to hour and a half wait.  No big deal, day before Valentine's Day, we get it. We give the host our name and number so that she may call us when our table is ready.  We went next door to the little wine shop, which is awesome by the way, split a bottle of wine and had some snacks.  An hour and forty minutes later we walked back over to ask about the table.  The host said that she had called 3 times, receiving a messaging saying my phone was out of order.  I immediately had my girlfriend call me, it rang right way.  I really do not think she even called. I also made sure the number was written correctly on the wait list and it was. 
We sat down at a table on the patio, ordered some drinks and appetizers.  The drinks came out quickly which was nice, but it took 39 minutes for our starters to hit the table.  No matter how busy you are, that is a very long time.  We also ordered the duck curry, that only took about 20 minutes to arrive.  Unfortunately we did not enjoy the flavor very much, or the very small about of duck that it was served with, so we kindly sent it back after only a few bites.  It was removed from our bill and we were very thankful. 

My biggest issue is that in events like this, the manager should come over and at least let you know about the wait and/or apologize.  Not that it is their fault, they can't control the back up in the kitchen, but, it doesn't hurt to touch a table.  

The manager only came over after we had paid and we were standing up to leave.  His comments were short, and there was no apology. If anything it was more of a questionnaire with excuses tied in. Doesn't matter.  

My girlfriend and I have more than 20 years of upscale dining management combined.  We know very well that the job is to \"recover\" a customer if you will, when you know about a poor experience.  I wish things would have gone differently at The Clever Koi."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and staff - love everything about the place!  If I lived Phoenix I would be a regular BUT I will get down there as often as I can!  Thanks for a great birthday celebration with my crew!"}
{"text":"Came here after reading reviews on the place on yelp. The staff was really nice and the young man that serviced us pretty much the whole time we were there was really attentive. The inside of the place looked pretty cool and had a well stocked bar. We got here around lunch time so we were given a piece of paper and you basically build your own bowl. Starting with noodles or rice and then going to pick meats and vegetables. Our bowls were ok, nothing crazy spectacular but they were not lacking flavor either. The real treat were the pork belly steamed buns! They were delicious! A place I would come back to visit for some appetizers and drinks on a night when there's nothing else to do."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a long time now and I'm glad I finally did! They have a great happy hour and the pork belly ramen is a winner, also I had a few ginger ciders they were oh so yummy! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things about Clever Koi but was a little underwhelmed after the night was said and done. They had a lot of interesting small plates that I wanted to try (duck fat siracha wings, tempura octopus, kimchi waffle and chicken, and kimchi fried rice with steak). Wings were alright nothing special, the tempura octopus was soggy, kimchi chicken and waffle was good, the fried rice wasn't bad. Dessert was really good though, had the banana bread fritters and I'd go back to get them and maybe try some other interesting items. 

Overall I'd say it's not bad food but don't get your hopes up too high for some of those unique or interesting items because they might just come out really ordinary. 


Oh but service was really good and I always appreciate that!"}
{"text":"We went with a group of 5- would highly recommend coming with a large group so you can try everything

Would get again: the ramen! Absolutely delicious, the poached egg was perfect. The dumplings were moist & perfect, with a nice touch of spice. The house made sriacha was an added bonus. Would also recommend the steamed buns (the bottom two on the list- pork bacon? And lamb?) can't remember. But also very good

For me, the katsu is not my cup of tea. It was actually very good but I do not prefer fried chicken meals. My bf, however, loved it. 

This place is actually easier for picky eaters to enjoy than I would have expected. We will definitely be back.  Also! Relatively cheap, we were all stuffed & paid twenty a person with tip! The ambience is pretty laid back & the lighting isn't too dark which I absolutely hate about Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The pork belly bun was life changing. Lemon pepper chicken ramen was out of this world!! Totally coming here again. If you don't like spicy food make sure you ask about heat levels as a lot of the items have Sriracha sauce in them."}
{"text":"One of the most interesting restaurants.
I wouldn't know exactly how to explain.  Bravo to the Chef for his/ her courageous mix of flavors,  ingredients and ideas. 
Everything is very well thought out.   
Experiment... by eating here.  
We loved the chow mein.  Loved the fried forbidden black rice and short rib dumplings.
Good service.  Friendly.  Nice atmosphere.  Sit outside."}
{"text":"Really fantastic. Great options for all the Pacific Rim food choices. The happy hour menu is great. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Unique food, a nice blend of Asian cuisine. I came for lunch and I bought the pork Ramen and it had kimchi in it as well (still unsure if I liked that or not) the pork belly was really good with nice soft boiled eggs. My girlfriend got a shrimp and scallops yakisoba which was very good and mildly spicy. The service was great as well as this ambience, a great place for a casual lunch and I would like to come back to try other entrees, the wings, and the bar."}
{"text":"Amazing  food! I drank a delicious Malbec. We had great service, ambience  was very nicr. Can't  wait to enjoy the patio when it cools down. Definitely  recommend!"}
{"text":"Food 6/10
Service 8/10
Value 5/10

Came here with high expectations given the great reviews on Yelp. Came up way short. It's something like fusion Asian cuisine, so Asian ingredients with western flavor. Got the dumplings, fried rice, duck, steak, and some drinks. Underwhelming flavors. Drinks were ok. Came out to be $35 per person. The ambience of the place is nice though. Good to take your date out, but if you're looking for fantastic food and you are familiar with quality Asian food, this is not the place for you"}
{"text":"I had high expectations based on all the glowing reviews, but the quality of the food fell a bit short. It was mediocre, not great but also not terrible. It's an OK value so I might be willing to give it another chance. Service was quite attentive.

Started with the Sazerac cocktail ($10) which was pretty good. I expected it to be served on the rocks but it was just in an Old Fashioned glass by itself.

Pork Belly Bun ($4.50/single bun) - This was a mixed bag. The positive is that the pork belly was really delicious and had a nice crispy skin. The hoisin sauce pairs well and the cilantro works to add a nice kick of flavor. The bun is where it really let me down. It was a bit hard and felt like they had it sitting around for a day or two.

Rabbit Dumpling ($10/4 dumplings) - Overall the flavors were good. The inside of the dumplings was stuffed with ground rabbit, which tasted fine, slightly gamey, not overly dry. The pickled thin slices of carrot were really good and helps brighten the dish. The dumplings were shaped kind of weird, it was rectangular so definitely not what I'm used to. If they were going for gyoza they needed to pan fry it for a bit longer to get the outside slightly crispy.

Pineapple Duck ($16) - This was a duck leg (more like a leg quarter) that was really crispy on the outside sitting on a white rice deep fried \"croquette\". The duck leg was a bit overcooked in some areas which can be expected based on how much variation in thickness there is with the cut. The rice was quite interesting and not something I've really had before, it was crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. The Chinese eggplant was really good and not too soft or hard, and seasoned with some Sriracha."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a whim based on their yelp rating/reviews. It definitely paid off.

To start off with the atmosphere is on point, welcoming yet classy. The 3 owners we are all awesome and super friendly. I sat at the bar by the grill and just talked with the the head chef while I ate his delicious food.

Now to the food. Ok so menu was super condensed  and easy to navigate for anytype of bowl you want. I ordered a udon with pork broth, pork belly, and steak. It also had various vegetables and egg.

The pork belly was crispy and phenomenal steak was cooked perfectly  and broth was on point. Im a soy sauce guy but I needed none for this meal.

When I was talking to the chef I mentioned how amazing the pork face sriracha  looked and hes like wanna try them. Ummmm yeah dude!!!

Pork Face Dumplings with home made sriracha=Amazeballs. No more description needed just order them and be blown away.

10 vibe
10 food
10.5 service.

Overall I would definitely come back and recommend all my friends. I am also stoked they are opening a second location in gilbery at the end of September 

Good job guys great restaurant."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out but unfortunately it was very underwhelming. The atmosphere was nice for a date however the food was mediocre and over priced. 

Tip: Don't go out of your way to make it during happy hour. It's about a one dollar difference."}
{"text":"Meh... Not impressed. Hype doesn't match what I thought I was going to get. Tables on top of each other so close you can hear everyone else's conversation... Entertaining as that may be perhaps save the fancy wood slat ceiling and put in something acoustic to absorb the sound of too many people in a small space. 

Tried all the steam buns... Pretty good actually. Confused why it was called pineapple duck confit - - - Nothing confit about it, it was deep fried... Perhaps cooked confit but definitely was finished deep fried. Flavorless. Seriously disappointed. Not screwing around or exaggerating...we really really really were expecting something special based on all the talk about this place. I had braised short rib...hard to mess up right? They give chopsticks so you should be able to eat every dish with chopsticks. Wrong. So tough on the outside I had to bring in reinforcements and use chopsticks in one hand and fork in the other. It was a cute presentation of a hot meat over the top of a cold potato salad... Ya hot over cold.... Dumb not edgy. **If you want a \"wow factor\" short rib dish go try Beau McMillan's at Elements at Sanctuary....hot meat over hot side

Their cocktail menu is cool, creative... Probably what's keeping them alive since the bar was full, drinks were good, and the price was same as an entree."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times it was amazing! It's my fiancée's new favorite restaurant. The steamed buns and the dumplings were both delicious. Very unique menu. I want to come back and try everything!"}
{"text":"David behind the bar was amazing. The cocktails Josh has created are out of this world amazing. I recommend this to anyone who is a free spirit eater! Absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place with my family it was recommend to us by my daughter's boyfriend. The service is great, the staff was very attentive and knowledgeable.  I received good suggestion on the drinks and food. I tried the Aviator drink which was very good, loved it! 
The location was small and modern we were seated in the patio. It was late on Saturday night and there was a cool breeze which made it comfortable eating environment. 
The food was tasty, I tried the steam bun: Pork Belly, Waffles and Chicken and Soft Shell Crab. Each was original in flavor.  I also had the Shrimp and Scallop Dumplings they were delicious.
My boys tried the Pork Roman noodle. They liked the noodles but were not big fans of the pork belly. Teens can't always please them.
My husband and daughter had the Spicey Seafood Hot Pot. They were both pleased with the flavor and spiciness. 
We shall return to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and got corn dogs and wings. The corn dogs were really good and the wings weren't bad. Cool building and free valet. Staff was nice and friendly. Price for happy hour was good. Also tried some chicken and waffle thing and it was very good. Try it out"}
{"text":"Cleaver Koi is the epitome of a restaurant trying too hard to distinguish themselves from the norm of Asian cuisine; result... catastrophe.

Pros: good service, and decorum. 
Cons: worst ramen I've tasted.. lemon pepper chicken ramen, tastes identical to top ramen- chicken flavor. My girlfriend ordered the harvest vegetable ramen, needless to say, it tastes like warmed up barbecue sauce mixed with fish sauce. The pad Thai (I know what you're thinking... pad Thai is always safe to bank on) wrong!!! Horribly tasteless. 

Please take my words as a grain of salt, and give the place a chance! I'm just speaking from experience if you thoroughly enjoy ramen, and it's craft, please do not eat there! I just saved you 16 bucks, yeah this place over charges for their watery top ramen. 

Cleaver Koi is an apparent identity crisis with its flavors lacking, and is disgracing and disgustingly upsetting within Asian cuisine. I see why they label themselves as bars, cocktails, and burgers. Just be prepared for Tex-mex takes on sobas, if you're familiar...there you have Cleaver Koi!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Tremendous ambience. Great cocktails. Kudos to the visionary team that created this small slice of heaven."}
{"text":"Please bring back the create your own ramen, on the lunch menu.  It was THE reason that my coworkers and I often came in for lunch (and to watch soccer), but no longer.  If you attempt to customize your ramen, it ends up being $15 since it \"isn't on the menu\".  That is a tad absurd when I still cannot order exactly what I want."}
{"text":"The Clever Koi is a fabulous place to go for lunch! You \"create you own\" soup, bowl, stir-fry... whatever... it's fresh, timely, and delicious. One of the best Asian fusion restaurants downtown. The servers and staff are charming and always pleasant. A wonderful dining experience for anyone looking to sit down and have a peaceful lunch."}
{"text":"I never thought I liked Gin, but their happy hour drinks are delicious. You must try the Spicy Tuna Chips and the Veal Dumplings!"}
{"text":"So darn hip. So darn good. So darn clever. Clever koi has been my go to for ramen. The lemon pepper chicken ramen will never disappoint. Nor will the steamed pork bun as an appetizer. The noodles in the ramen mixed with the crunchiness of the vegetables and the sweetness of the lemon in the chicken is to die for. 

Today, I decided to switch it up and go with the kimchi fried rice with the lemongrass chicken and it was just okay. The egg and chicken were done really well but there was a lot of spices and seasoning and it would have paired well with a sauce of some kind to offset how dry the seasoning made it. Overall, 7/10. 

I will always return and I will never stray from lemon pepper chicken ramen again. Stay clever, friends."}
{"text":"Great steamed buns! The pork belly is so fresh and seasoned to perfection! Goes great with many of the great craft beers to choose from!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, especially the Pim's cup. Good service and delicious food. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Tuesday.  Sat outside- which was really nice. Service was great!  They were friendly and fast.  We ordered 3 steamed buns: pork belly, soft shell crab, catfish.  Crab was our favorite.  I ordered the Zesty Noodles.  Taste was pretty good. I added some lime to it which I loved.  It says it comes with shrimp and scallops.  I had to search for the fish.  If there was fish in there, it was chopped up so small that I couldn't see it.  I prefer it in larger pieces where I can taste it and actually see it..."}
{"text":"Several  of my friends  recommended  this place  so  we finally  tried the place . It was very quiet  when we got there. The place allows for customized  orders . We started  with the pork dumping.  The meat was not seasoned well  and was mushy . The pork bun had a lot of flavor but the pork belly was too  fatty.  We tried  the Ramen noodles with the pork broth . It was a little  bitter and too salty. We tried  the duck fried rice which was OK . The best dish was the shrimp  chow mein. The food was below average . I think I am too used to eating Chinese.  Service was good . Don't think the I will be back . The price was a little  high for lunch"}
{"text":"Great food but small portions. Set at the bar and received excellent service. Loved the duck sriracha  wings, chicken and waffle bun, short rib dumplings, and the lemon pepper chicken noodle soup.  The soup had lots of flavor.  The atmosphere is modern and the ladies room had a delightful candle burning.  A nice addition to downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"The Clever Koi is one of those unique Phoenix establishments that exemplify the positive evolution of our city. It's privately owned, employs outstanding staff, and serves imaginative, delicious food. My friends and I have become regulars not just because we love their product and service, but also because it feels good to support such great people. Clever Koi is a must-try for out-of-towners or locals and I'm confident you'll be back many times."}
{"text":"I was here on 7/1/17.  Vegetable chow mein and the kimchi was fantastic!  A great cocktail menu too.  I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic!  We had the short rib dumplings, pineapple duck and the chow mein. The kids had the ramen and loved it!  Our waitress, Kenzie, was wonderful!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've only come for lunch and I was very intrigued so much so I wanted to have dinner here. Tonight it so happened my boyfriend and I came to have dinner and we were blown away with such stellar customer service. We met Nick who is one of the owners as he walked around and made everyone feel so welcomed. He introduced himself and asked if we needed anything. After that we felt we had made a new friend. While sitting at their Wok Bar the second owner who appeared to be the top chef was so informative with the dishes. Jarred was phenomenal and extremely thorough. He even made us a dish and said it was on the house. Over all our experience here was the best I have ever had in an establishment like this. I will definitely come back.!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group on a Saturday afternoon. Not busy at all service was slow. First dish I ordered was a bust ...eggplant & rice was so dry I sent it back...came with a spicy sauce I didnt like but the servers were nice about it & took it off my bill.They should take it off the menu. I had the Enabler...the drinks are strong & beers are good. Had the steamed buns & this is the only thing really good here."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and sat at the bar. Our bartender, Roman, was knowledgeable & attentive. We tried the soft shell crab steamed bun to start and it was amazing! Such great flavor & texture. We also got the house Pad Thai and the pork ramen. My sister is very picky about her ramen and she liked this one. My Pad Thai was delicious. The noodles were nice and firm in a good way. Nothing is more disappointing than getting a Pad Thai that is too saucy or so soft that the noodles break when you lift them. This Pad Thai was supreme. We heard very good things about their cocktails and the rumors are all true! Yes, get a cocktail made by Roman!"}
{"text":"Well, I really wanted to to have an experience worth five stars. It is next to my place, I see it packed everyday and had hoped for much better.

We went on a Friday evening and, as expected, it was packed. We were able to get outdoor seats and liked our seating and ambiance. One of our drinks, Temperence Trap, was the highlight of the evening. The drink had a lot going on and was refreshing.  The food, however, was decent but unexceptional. In fact, we have tried much better at many other places. 

I tried Seafood Hot Pot which had a decent amount of seafood in it. The broth was unexceptional. The dish lacked something but I can't point to one item. Broccolini Ramen could have used more broth. It was too dense especially given the flavor profile and the ingredients. Our server was attentive but impersonal which was okay with us.

Now I would have given it four stars if it wasn't for the price. We found it to be on the pricier side given that dishes were rather standard. I am sure a lot went into them but our palates missed whatever it was. I would be more sympathetic to these prices if the restaurant was located in an upcoming area in Miami or the Bay area. 

Overall, it is a decent place if you want to spend your evening in a place with a good vibe."}
{"text":"The food here is really good and I love the house made sriracha and kimchi. Price is a little steep but I think it's worth it for such great food. Only complaint is that it's a little pretentious, but it sort of comes with the foodie territory."}
{"text":"Well this place was a disappointment. I did a check in as the four of us were at the 20 minute mark waiting for our lunch. In the end it took 30 minutes to get noodle bowls for lunch. When we started seeing people getting their bowls before us of course we asked about it and were told the other table had their cards filled out before us. Well okay I suppose, I wasn't really paying that close attention but I did watch our server waiting at the counter. So food comes out, not all at the same time so a coworker had to wait while everyone had theirs. She had rice. Come on...I know the rice and noodles are prepared ahead of time. Why is it taking so long? 
Another coworker commented that her noodles were burned. I checked mine-some were burned as well.  The server gave her another bowl which tasted much better. I will say the the shrimp I had was good and my friends like their proteins as well
So $10 for 4 decently cooked shrimp, half burned noodles and a 30 minute wait when we were one of the first to be seated. Not worth it to me so I won't come back."}
{"text":"What an awesome place to on the weekend or during the week for dinner.  You can't go wrong with their Happy hour menu.  The ramen here is delicious and it is only $5 on the Happy hour menu.  Also the chicken wings are amazing too.  It is right by my house so it is nice to either walk or scooter here.  While if you are looking for an awesome place to go for HH in downtown you should check out this place."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour...creative refreshing cocktails, lots of food options for good prices, and pretty funky atmosphere. Had the bee's knees which was light and delicious in a pretty glass. Get the edamame fritters...amazing!"}
{"text":"I've heard really good things about the clever koi. Decided to come randomly on a Saturday. Saw they had Happy hour til 6. Jackpot. Decided to get the pork ramen. So damn good. The pork was really crispy, broth was flavorful. My waiter was great. By far the best ramen I've had in Phoenix. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Gotta say - this was an excellent meal, and have been back twice. The steamed buns are very good - and as some have suggested are large, but not excessive. They come in a bunch of flavors, and the only downside is you can't really cut the dang things to share. But you probably won't share anyways! The house bacon and pickled mustard greens are superb, rich and tasty. The roasted duck noodles are perfect and are just the right size for a meal and the chicken katsu with the egg on top is great as well. Great bar selection, very nice and attentive staff and some chefs that look like they mean business makes this a really nice place for those of us that enjoy the tapas experience. Great, great, great...."}
{"text":"When I first heard that Clever Koi was coming to the east valley I was suuuper happy. I love clever koi but driving to central Phoenix is a bit far from me to enjoy ramen and their other food that they serve. I went to the Gilbert locations with my friends to try it out and they loved it. Their ramen is pretty unique tasting to the ramen I have tasted in the past, it's more on the spicier side I guess, but it's definitely different and stands out. I think it's the kimchi that's added in with the toppings. The pork belly here is delicious. It's nice and crispy and also tender and juicy. Aside from the ramen, I HIGHLY recommend getting the bao, which are steamed buns. You can choose from duck, pork belly, soft shell crab, and another meat I forgot. I got kinda like a sampler so I got all of them. The duck and the pork belly are a certified banger. The crab was okay, but I'd choose the duck or pork belly over it because it's what I'm used to. I would recommend this place for some great ramen and baos. The kimchi fried rice is also a great dish to order if you aren't in the mood for some ramen too!

#CERTIFIEDBANGER"}
{"text":"On a weekend, if you plan to visit this place. .do make a reservation since they really get some good crowd and it's busy... we made reservations for group of 7 and ordered steamed buns like roasted pork belly, chicken n waffles, soft shell crab, mall plate-Kung pao chicken wings n in dumplings pig face... we loved it.. the quantity is small but it's a fancy restaurant with gr8 crowd, good service n the food is so good, u don't mind if it's expensive. We then ordered spicy seafood hot pot, pork ramen, lemon pepper chicken ramen n duck curry... these were 2 good... in fact the pork ramen is out of the world and I'm not even a fan of pork but it was so good that I've been craving for pork ramen since long. Gr8 place 2 impress a date, celebrate occasions or just have a good time with family n friends"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We went with a couple of friends for drinks and dinner. We sat on the patio and enjoyed it.

The food was excellent. We started with several small plates - Octopus (5 stars), Tuna Chips (5 stars, so good we ordered another one), Pork Ramon (4 stars), Duck fat wings (4 stars), Lettuce Cups (3 stars, good, but lacked any wow). My friends got a few of the steamed buns (3 stars according to hubby) and seemed happy enough. They came like a little taco, instead of a traditional bun, which disappointed them. For dinner I got the Kimchi Fried Rice with pork belly. It was DELICIOUS! 

The alcoholic beverages are so refreshing and tasty. I had the Bees Knees - Gin with lavender and honey. Yum. So delicately delicious. I sipped on each of the other mixed drinks my friends started with and all were just as yummy.

The service was absolutely perfect. Server was knowledgable and excited about the menu options. She knew what was gluten free and when she didn't she went and double checked. 

I'm so glad we have something like this in Gilbert now! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to places in Phoenix! I almost always get the tuna chips to start and my boyfriend pretty much sticks to the pork belly ramen. But you really can't go wrong here.The service is great and overall it's a great place for a meal. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Let's talk about the staff! I went to clever koi for my birthday and EVERYONE made sure they helped me feel special. They work, wonderfully, as a team. Our server was nice and knew her stuff! She recommended the pork belly steamed buns to start off with and thank goodness she did!!! The flavor was phenomenal. She then recommended riding the pine for my cocktail and it was so good it was dangerous! My husband got the duck curry and couldn't stop telling me about how much flavor was in every bite. I got the Pad Thai which needless to say was delicious. But the best part was the dessert! They brought a candle out with my pineapple upside down cake!! With lime zest, wontons, and a coconut sauce... I mean seriously.. why aren't you there yet?"}
{"text":"I'm at about 4.5 stars for this place. Service was knowledgeable and excellent. Happy hour filled us up with exotic and tasty food and drink with a measley bill. Only thing thats keeping me from 5 stars were the dumplings were a little less than expected. Not a deal breaker tho and would recommend."}
{"text":"Bravo to the modern Asian noodle and dumpling house. The noodles soups are top notch, especially the Hot Pot seafood soup, as well as the simply delicious in a bowl, Roasted Pork noodle soup with ramen. I'm still thinking about it until now, although I could do without the mushrooms (and I like mushrooms). My friend and I, shared two starters, the Smoked \"Pig Face\" dumplings and the Peking Duck bun. The dumplings were scrumptious because of the pork, yum but i'm not sure if the price is justified at $8 for 4 pieces, it's pretty much the size of a gyoza dumpling, so, it's not large but taste factor it's on point. As for the Peking duck bun that can be split between two but one bun per person will suffice because it's plenty and delicious, I'm looking forward to trying out their other buns in the near future. My friend got the chicken katsu, and she said it was pretty good but advised that in the future, she'd get the sauce on the side because it was quite salty. Overall, love the resto layout, the overall feel is cozy but for some odd reason there seems to be a draft. Service was not slow but there seem to be confusion with some orders, I'm thinking it's first official day jitters, and eventually i'm sure, service will smoothen out. I'm looking forward to my next visit for a steaming bowl of noodles or maybe kimchi fried rice. YUM!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night with my little lady. Clever Koi is definitely a pretty hip place. We had actually just left a dinner party but were down for drinks. I ended up ordering a couple apps. The salt and pepper shrimp and the octopus in broth was sooooo good. 

Pros:
-great food 
-awesome atmosphere 
-open kitchen 

Cons:
-small seating area"}
{"text":"Clever Koi is a trendy modern restaurant that offers a fusion of Asian dishes. I've been there a few times and have really enjoyed all of the dishes. Their pig face dumplings were delicious and flavorful with that added bite from the kimchi, as were their Asian version of corn dog bites that contained chinese sausage. Their ramen was also a modern version, as it was creamier and contained less broth than the traditional stuff, but it did not disappoint as it was full of fresh vegetables and very filling. I really enjoyed the Massaman curry with duck and a delicious Thai flavored coconut curry sauce. If you're looking for a healthier option, the Mixed Grill is a fantastic choice which contains your choice of meat. I chose the flat iron bulgogi which was an awesome choice, the meat had a nice marinade and was cooked perfectly at medium rare. The veggies that came with it were also fresh and crunchy, and the dipping sauces were a very good addition.

Clever Koi also has a fantastic happy hour which is from 4-7. They make a great Pimms Cup and Dark & Stormy. If you're looking for a less sweet drink then the Paloma is also a great choice. I love how their happy hour includes lots food options too. I would highly recommend Clever Koi, I will return many more times to enjoy their happy hour and delicious Asian Fusion."}
{"text":"Unique and awesome. The drinks are curated, not thrown onto the menu. Food is flavorful and tasted great. A real find, should be a cult favorite. Fusion menu. I intend to eat here every time I return to Phoenix."}
{"text":"So after cooking all day on Thanksgiving, then putting up Christmas decorations all day today my husband suggested we eat here after seeing it on a previous visit to another restaurant. It did not disappoint. Handcrafted cocktails were delicious. The enabler is popular for reason.  Food was excellent. The most tender octopus I have ever had and my husband was in love with the pork belly bun. The lettuce cups were delicious and very fresh tasting. Ambience was fantastic and the service was top-notch. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and myself went to Clever Koi for the first time tonight. We will definitely return as I'm already thinking of the Tuna chips and chicken and waffle buns. We tried a huge variety of small plates, buns and dumplings. Even the calamari was great! Their housemade siracha was super! They have a beautiful variety of drinks and all we tried were strong but in such a good way. Our waiter was so great at explaining the menu of food and drinks. He made our evening. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. The dishes were interesting. We had a group of five people so we ordered a wide variety. The brussels sprouts were crunchy and delicious. I got the sweet potato dumplings, and I liked the kimchi. I tasted the calamari salad and I really enjoyed it. others at our table got the pigs face dumplings and duck buns but I did not get to taste them. They looked good. We sat on the patio and there was a lot of traffic noise, plus a homeless drunk man passed out on the sidewalk right next to us and he hit his head hard. I went to help him and one of the waiters escorted him down the street. Everyone there was kind, efficient, and I will be back."}
{"text":"Super high quality food and the service was great. Very educated waiter. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Pork belly bun and soft crab - soft crab was light and crisp, flavorful but just personally not a fan of the pickled cucumber with it. Pork belly bun was delicious as expected

We each got pork belly ramen - from the Bay Area in California, I have pretty high expectations for ramen, but noodle texture was good and right on. 

Kim chee topping was not what you'd typically expect and not what I normally want with my ramen noodle and broth but since it's an Asian fusion restaurant, it was an interesting combo to try. Kim chee aside, the pork belly was crisp and bamboo shoots once soaked in the broth went well with the dish.

Didn't seem like there were a lot of ramen places in the area so this is a great option if you're craving it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while and always have loved the food. The service has always been great as well. Tonight I came in alone, sat at the bar (by the line) and always love to watch the action. It's a Friday night and they were pretty slammed. I am pretty low maintenance and knew what I wanted, easy order... I'm in the service industry as well, so when I get great service I really appreciate it. It is so nice to have people coming by and genuinely saying it was good to see me, and If I needed anything else. I felt as if I had the entire staff looking out for me.  The food was everything I was hoping for, the little dessert treat was unexpected. 
Thanks Clever Koi for tonight-  you'll see me again soon. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Go now! This 5 star review is equally deserving on two fronts: 1) The Restaurant; and 2) The Management. The place is great, but read on to The Management piece as to why the guys running this place are out and out champs. 

The Restaurant
My wife has been trying to get me here for a couple of weeks now and we finally headed there Friday after work. First impression was the place is really well appointed, but not trying too hard - inviting, hip, but not pretentious. The cocktail menu was a nice surprise. Good wines, beers and sake, but the surprise was the really interesting cocktails. I ordered a bourbon drink with thai chili infused honey. Distinctively bourbon on the front, slight heat on back. Really darn good. 

The food, though, was clearly the best part. My wife and I shared several dishes, with the clear winner the pork dumplings on a bed of spicy kimchi and peppers. This thing was probably the best dumpling/pot sticker I ever had. The dumpling was soft with crispy edges and the meat was tender and not too greasy. My wife couldn't stop raving about the great texture. We got an octopus soup and ramen, both outstanding. Lastly, we ordered a duck bun dish, which I've had similar types at other places and all were way too greasy, but this was not at all, just great. 

The Management
The owners really care about their customers and are doing whatever they can to make the dining experience the best possible. They have the unfortunate circumstance to be located next to the George and Dragon, a Phoenix staple and outright dump, but the problem here is that the management of the pub is so perturbed that another place opened near them, they have taken on the hobby of watching people park in their nearly invisibly posted parking spots (dirt covered paint on pavement) and calling a tow truck, purely out of spite. Little does the G&D management know that being a jerk to The Clever Koi impacts their customers also. Case in point, I parked in what turned out to be one of the pub's spots. Instead of them telling me to simply move my car, they called a tow truck. As my car was being mounted, unbeknownst to me, the owners of The Clever Koi paid off the tow truck driver to protect their customer, in this case, me. Apparently, this happens nearly all the time, with the pub owners having cars towed, purely to be jerks. Little do these guys know that my wife and I were talking about going to have a beer there after dinner. I will NEVER go this this pub again. 

I went and talked with the manager of the G&D and told him how childish and stupid his tactics were. He thinks he's hurting his restaurant neighbors, but being a jerk to the customers also hurts them. 

You can read my well-deserving 0 star review of them, but the point here is that The Clever Koi is a great place. It's well appointed, not pretentious and the food is interesting and delicious. This place is solid. Go now - just make sure you take advantage of the complimentary valet."}
{"text":"This place was great! We actually were hesitant to come for a very long time because my sister said she wasn't a fan at all. On a whim my wife and I decided to give it a shot and really enjoyed it!

We came on a Saturday night around 8pm. It was full but since we were just two, we sat at the bar which has full service. The bartender who helped us was very nice and helpful. He made some suggestions for us but wasn't pushy about it. My wife ordered a \"Hey Bartender\" which is a custom drink based on your preferences which the bartender asked her about. It was tasty. I ordered their house grapefruit soda. Also awesome and refreshing! 

For appetizers we ordered the shrimp and chive dumplings as well as the pig face dumplings. The shrimp and chive were our favorite of the two but the pig face was definitely unique and tasty as well. 

For dinner we ordered the Pork Ramen to split. This is where I could see where my sister thought it was salty. However, I like salty so I'm not a good gauge. My wife really enjoyed it as well and said she'd rather it be slightly salty than bland. 

Overall a great experience! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Friendly staff. Everything was fresh. I'll come here again!  Chow mein was awesome. They say that the ramen is the bomb."}
{"text":"This is really a 4.5 star place....particularly for the ambiance and Clever design.  The food is pretty tasty but not over-the-top fab.  

Daisy is a great waitress with a friendly smile and she's attentive without being irritating.  

I've heard that old business next door will tow your car so be careful to park appropriately!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I cannot get enough of this place. The first time we went there was for Valentine's Day. Perfect drinks, perfect food and perfect service. We went again for lunch one day and the owner, Nick, came over to our table and introduced himself and made great conversation with us. These are the kind of people I want to give my money too! He also gave us a complimentary, homemade chocolate banana soft serve that was delicious. Overall great experience. Love it!"}
{"text":"This place is more of a 3.5 than 4 in my opinion. First I love modern things so this place def. Scream modern. Love the design and being there just makes me happy. 

The few times I was here I didn't recall having issue with my servers. We went with big groups so taking a bit longer than normal for dinner to me is understandable. 

I do however have mixed reviews with the food. The last time i was here the food was extremely salty. I love salt and like to add salt on my meal but it was beyond reasonable. On the other hand...the last time I had the buns they were yummy!

I also like that this place have mixed crowd which is another thing i look for when I go out."}
{"text":"I ate Pork Face Dumplings!  And I loved them.  Really cute place, what a find.  Great Asian Fusion menu with a super inexpensive happy hour.  The Pork Ramen was chock full of vegetables, noodles (gluten free upon request) and big pieces of pork belly.  The venue is perfect for a midtown restaurant right off Central.  Nice little front patio so you can watch the lite rail and the hubbub...or go inside and enjoy the quieter ambiance.  My husband had the Woodfire Vegie Platter with short ribs.  We all kept stealing his short ribs when he wasn't looking.  I want to go back...soon.."}
{"text":"Downtown Gilbert's newest addition to Main Street.  Interesting food! In a good way! Lettuce cups, steamed buns (pork belly and soft shell crab and it's the actual crab) , Spicy Seafood Hot Pot and Lemon Pepper Chicken Ramen! Food was good. Happy to have this new spot to pop in to. Great patio, vast drink menu! Closed Mondays. Happy hour daily from 3-6."}
{"text":"Peer pressure can be a powerful thing.  Particularly when a peer keeps prodding you to pay of a visit to one of their culinary favorites.  Despite such efforts by her and other peers in the past, I've learned to always temper my expectations and go in with an open mind.  Oh, I do my homework in advance of course, but I've learned that everyone can have a favorite that might not mesh with my palette the same way it does with theirs.  In the case of Clever Koi however, there's more than enough great food and drink (as well as great vibes) to satisfy me and all of my peers.

Clever Koi occupies one of a pair of newly constructed modern commercial spaces along Central Ave just a few blocks north of Indian School.  In one building lies Central Wine Bar and Model Citizen Hair Salon.  In the other lies a beautifully outfitted restaurant with windows galore, a picturesque outdoor patio overlooking Central Ave, and modern furniture throughout.  But if you really wanna see be where the action is, do yourself a favor and sit at the bar like I did.  Besides the bartending staff mixing up drinks and commiserating with the customers, the owners (yes, the actual owners) are cooking up all of the restaurant's signature dishes in an open cooking area right up front complete with a smoker, a grill, and full prep area.  All of it right there to see, smell, and tickle your senses.

I came during happy hour when a number of their drinks and signature dishes are discounted.  I actually tried a couple of their cocktails including the Fish House Punch and the Old Fashioned.  The Punch included rum, cognac, lemon juice and peach schnapps and had what looked like a little spice blend on top and was served in a clear tea cup.  Odd presentation, but a very refreshing drink.  The Old Fashioned was a pretty typical rendition, though I think there was a hint of brandy to go with the bourbon that gave it an extra kick.

The Asian steamed bun dishes aren't discounted for happy hour unfortunately, but past experiences at places like Nobuo and Adobo Dragon have taught me that good Asian steamed bun dishes are not to be missed.  After struggling to pick two I took the bartenders advice and ordered three (I might've been a little buzzed at the time, but I digress).  I went with the duck confit, chicken & waffles, and soft shell crab buns.  The chicken & waffles one is actually a piece of syrup covered chicken inside a waffle with kimchi flavoring, so not a true Asian steamed bun in the purest sense.  It was weird to gaze upon at first, but pretty tasty.  The soft shell crab also has an odd appearance as the entire crab (claws and all) is there in front of you topped with aioli and cucumber, but that crab was delicious and I loved the fish sauce they put on it.  But my favorite byfar of the three was the duck confit.  Ridiculously tender duck and plenty of it complimented by a lightly sweetened plum sauce.  If you're coming here for the steamed buns, by all means be sure to include the duck confit.

For the main event, it was time for a noodle dish since that appears to be Clever Koi's main calling card.  On their Happy Hour menu is arguably the one noodle dish that probably gets more Yelp mentions and more compliments than any other.  The Pork Ramen.  Pork Belly, Kimchi, Hearts of Palm, a hard boiled egg all topping a bevy of noodles.  First and most importantly, the broth for this dish is out of this world.  I could've slurped the broth and been completely happy with this dish.  Seriously, the tender pork, soft noodles, and other cast of characters were a bonus, but the broth is what makes this dish.  To complete the evening (despite being completely full), I shared an order of their banana foster fritters.  Basically cinnamon covered donut holes with banana filling inside and a caramel sauce to dip them in.  Yup, they're as good as they sound.  I only had two since I was already full beyond belief, but it solidified the experience for me at this CenPho gem.

It would be safe to classify Clever Koi as Asian Fusion, but aside from that there's no one description that encapsulates the theme of this place.  From their vast bar selection of drink and mixed drink choices, to their innovative take on Asian steamed buns, to the complex flavor combinations of their noodle bowls, Clever Koi is unconstrained while still being authentic.  And the modern aesthetics make this a great place for a date, a group outing, or just hanging out with friends at the bar.  Total tab for me this night including the two cocktails, 3 steamed buns, ramen bowl, fritters, tax and tip came to about $50.  The prices for the pork ramen and cocktails were discounted quite a bit for happy hour so I would certainly recommend coming here around then.  But as I said earlier, even if its not happy hour, I recommend sitting at the bar.  And let owners Joe, Josh, Jared and Nick make your experience as memorable as it was for me."}
{"text":"They are not capable of reading out of state ID's at this restaurant. My girlfriend and I are newly 21 and from Washington, and were hassled way more about our ID's here than at any other restaurant that we've ordered drinks at. After showing everything from old ID's to social security cards, our server was somehow still under the impression that our ID's were fake. Clearly we had real ID's, not to mention why would someone underage attempt to purchase expensive cocktails. Once turned down by our server I asked to see a manager, believing that surely at least a manager would be able to tell a real ID from a fake, only to find that the man working with us the entire time was actually the owner. Given the situation, having an old ID and government issued social security card, we felt completely disrespected that an owner of all people still could not comprehend and assess the situation correctly.

EDIT in response to the restaurants comment: the stumble spoken of on the ID's information was a simple switch of only two digits on the address, nothing more. It is not true that we were asked for additional identification; this added information was on our own accord in response to being accused of using fake ID's, and is again not a logical thing for someone who would be using a fake ID to do. We clearly had no issue standing up for the sake of our identifications, because we were being mislabeled. We left feeling disrespected and accused of being liars when we had absolutely nothing to hide."}
{"text":"OMG, best ramen I've ever had. 
Try out the pork ramen and pork steam bun. You'll never regret it.

Nice place, nice people, and the best ramen in town.

This is nothing but the best"}
{"text":"Fantastic venue!  I think Clever Koi is a great fusion of Asian cuisine. I attended the soft opening. It was busy as expected. There are a few kinks to work out as this is a new concept. But the food was great. I ordered the kimchi fried rice with seafood sausage. 

My drink was also wonderful with hints of ginger and a beautiful garnish. 

Our server was very kind. The restaurant has nowhere to go but up and the server believed this with great conviction."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the service was extraordinary. Our server, Pedro was outstanding. We will definitely be back.

My favorite item on the menu is the black bean and celery root cakes."}
{"text":"I agree with everyone, and for a good reason. They are the nicest and coolest staff you will meet running a restaurant. The cocktails and food are completely different and amazing. I joined yelp just so I could write about them."}
{"text":"Don't call \"black bean patties\" pancakes because it's a big misconception. Besides that it does give a cool Austin vibe. Food is alright, music is passive, staff is collected."}
{"text":"Great food and great service as far as friendliness and attentiveness of the service goes. The only down side I had was it took a very very long time to get our food. Management did come and apologize though. I got the Chicken Pho and added an egg!! Highly recommend adding an egg to any Pho that doesn't already have one!! I will be back, especially to try their happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Somebody blew up my phone last week with a group text about doing something. Thanks, thanks a lot. No really, thanks a lot, cause I probable wouldn't have ended up here otherwise. :-) I hopped on the scooter, pushed my way around the corner and found scooter (bike) parking at the bar next door. I did end up asking about a bike rack for their place and they said its on the way and should be up soon - they're only a month or so since opening day, so I guess you can't fault them for that ;-)

A handful of us stopped in for Happy Hour. With mixed drinks at $7 during HH, I had the bartender pour me \"Something with Hendricks, but not too sweet.\" It was Christmas time after all and what a better drink than something that tastes like a Christmas Tree? I left the specifics up to them, I figured they'd know better what to mix together than I would. I ended up with something with lemon and mint, and pretty tasty at that! 

After everyone arrived, we all ordered the $5 pork Ramen from the HH menu as well as the Asian chicken wings, both items delish, and both items worth coming back for during HH. I think the draft beers were $3 during HH and the total bill coming to like $60 after tax and tip, it was a reasonably priced dinner and drinks for four.

Their normal menu was a bit pricey for my taste, while I don't think I will aim here if it's not HH, you know I'll definitely be back for that Ramen, especially since I'm just a hop skip and a jump - or a scoot away.

Happy Yelping Phoenix, definitely come try their HH ramen - HH is 4-7pm (for the summer hours at least)!"}
{"text":"Food is innovative and delicious. Service is always pleasant. Ambiance and drinks are on point. One of my fave restaurants in central Phoenix, hands down."}
{"text":"Fab lunch here this week. Started with the chicken & Waffle (steamed bun style/taco) hot, fresh right off the stove. Also I sampled the pork belly bun--YUM 

Lunch was a bowl of ramen $5 then you add your add-ins egg, pork belly, Bok Choy w/many other options as well. 

Overall everything from the service to the food was very good. I want to try some cocktails one evening in the near future."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! This place is wonderful. Great drink selection and amazing, quality cocktails. Their food is also amazing. Best calamari that I've ever had. Definitely will be a repeat spot. Pricing is reasonable and the happy hour is great!"}
{"text":"Birthday dinner at Clever Koi. First time for four of our six. We had reservations for 7 on a Saturday night and the place was definitely hopping. It only seats 85 but I can't see fitting more than 60. It's tiny. 

We were seated and then greeted right away. Menus were brought but, due to the crowded place, drinks weren't requested for another 10-15. We got a glass of wine, two beers, a Pellegrino and a coke. We also ordered the crudités and Peking Duck Croquettes at the same time, since it was a slow start. 

The croquettes were excellent, with savory, crunchy exteriors and flavorful interior. The crudités were average. It had beets, fennel, carrots, snap peas, asparagus and radishes with a tzaziki sauce. The veggies were just too boring with no seasoning. 

For entrées we ordered the Mushroom ramen (2), 
Chow mien, Pork ramen, Thai beef and a Seafood Hot Pot (mine).  The ramen were well received by my table mates. I tasted the chow mien and the beef was tasty but the noodles were very bland, with no saucy flavors. My hot pot was okay. It had fish, scallops and shrimp. The fish was excellent and the shrimp, aside from being over cooked, was good. The scallops were 1/4\" small so virtually no flavor there. The broth was hot but really had no body to it. Decent flavor but it missed the mark. 

The vibe at Clever Koi is enough to bring me back. Our server, albeit a little slow, did his best. Try it and order the croquettes!"}
{"text":"I have grown to love Clever Koi. Don't come into Clever Koi expecting authentic asian cuisine. The chefs have managed to recreate famous asian dishes and have outstandingly  transformed them into their own. This place is definitely top notch.

For starters, my girlfriends and I ordered the tuna chips. Their tuna chips are perhaps one of my favorite tuna chips ever. The ahi tuna is fresh, the chips are light and have an airy texture, and the wasabi guacamole is perfect. I could eat this all day. We also had the black bean and celery root pancakes which I never thought I would like. Honestly, they were quite amazing. They were crispy and absolutely tasty. In addition, we had the calamari fries which weren't particularly amazing but still pretty good. We ordered one of each of the steamed buns, and they were all great. My favorite has always been the soft shell crab bun. The crab was fried and seasoned perfectly and paired well with the aoili and cucumber slaw. For our main dish, we had the duck curry, kimchi fried rice and pad thai. The duck curry was okay, nothing memorable about it. The kimchi fried rice was good however it didn't really taste much like kimchi - still pretty good though. The pad thai was not authentic pad thai but their version is great and was our favorite among the main dishes we ordered. Over all, I feel like Clever Koi appetizers/small plates are superior to their main dishes. 

I didn't like Clever Koi before but it still managed to keep reeling me in. The restaurant is gorgeous, and the experience is always alluring."}
{"text":"Super nice staff!  Every employee we met was courteous attentive and lots of fun. 

Nice dinning room and great location.

We ordered the pork Ramen, the zesty noodles, the grilled street corn, and the spicy chicken wings.  A lot of food for a great price.

Not a huge fan of the food.  The street corn was not good (maybe just because corn isn't in season).  The wings are very spicy but it kindof overpowered everything else.  I like kimchi a lot but it was very a very prominent flavor in all the food.  Too much.

I want to like this place.  We will probably return and try something different, just beware,  it won't be everyone's cup of tea."}
{"text":"Delicious! We ordered the kimchi fried rice, pad Thai with lemongrass chicken, short rib dumplings, and chicken & waffle steamed bun. Everything was good, fast service, friendly staff and plenty of leftovers!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times now and both times I have been very impressed with every aspect of the experience.

The service was phenomenal from the waitress to the bussers. The staff is very friendly and they work hard. This was our first time trying the happy hour, and it did not disappoint. We tried the kung pao wings and those were my favorite thing on the happy hour, and only $6. 

We also tried the spicy tuna nacho-type appetizer which was good but I wasn't a huge fan of the texture of the rice cracker. The kimchi fried rice with duck was AMAZING. No lie, that's the best fried rice I've ever had. We were able to order everything gluten-free as my wife has recently gone gluten-free.

Overall, this is my favorite Asian Fusion restaurant in Phoenix by far. Keep it up Clever Koi!"}
{"text":"Great food and cool atmosphere. The outdoor patio is nice during the cooler months. The Koi Burger was delicious! Our server, Austin, went above and beyond to get us what we needed. Great service!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back... I wish you were open for lunch! That pork belly is on point and I absolutely love your bunsso so so so good!!  Pork belly and soft shell crab are a toss up. That pork ramen was as delicious as the picture. Every bit of what good food should taste like... you have me wanting more and I would say that is a win..."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today with a coworker. It was about 1:30 when we arrived and they no longer had the bento box special so we built ourselves some noodle bowls for lunch. The process is simple but the server is happy to explain it to you. You pick you noodle or rice and then add your proteins and veggies. They also have some small bites available. We started with the chicken and waffle bun which was delicious. My coworker also had the pork belly steamed bun. I ordered the chow mien with lemongrass chicken and bok choy. My impression was that it was just ok. The whole dish seemed a little salty for my tastes and the bok choy a little bitter. The chicken in my bowl however was spot on. My coworker had ramen noodles with chicken broth, chicken, tofu, all the available veggies and the soft egg. He ate every drop of it so it is safe to assume he enjoyed it. I will definitely go back here and try something else. I hoping to go on a Wednesday for the chicken Katsu bento box.

The service here was excellent, everyone was friendly and extremely efficient. The atmosphere is trendy yet comfortable. 

Lunch for two was a bit pricey and ran us almost $45.00 not including the tip."}
{"text":"Not the greatest. Overpriced noodles and new age Asian food. Service was terrible. Waited over an hour for noodles to be served and the check took longer than expected. I probably would never return for a second chance."}
{"text":"Truely a remarkable dining experience. 
From entering the Clever Koi the owner greeted us with a warm smile. The waiter was very friendly and educated on their wine and menu. We enjoyed their Mon-Tuesday special. Dinner for two and a bottle of wine. Great date night! The wine was beautiful and the meal was to good for words. I even tried calamari for my first time and enjoyed it. I will gladly make this place a top pick for me and my family. We cant wait to dine here again and again"}
{"text":"We came for a work event. They preordered appetizers for the event. The food was unique, fresh and very flavorful. The drinks were oddly ho hum to me. I'd come back for the food tho!"}
{"text":"The Ramen is delicious but one thing that really caught my attention was the fried rice it taste really fresh and clean. They also have a chicken and waffle bite that is a must try."}
{"text":"This was second visit and they did not disappoint me. I had the pork belly fried brown rice with mushrooms, bok choy, and soft boiled egg, amazing. Very nice to see Andrew again and our menu advisor she was awesome (forgive me I didn't get her name). I'm sure to be back soon."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of dishes here over the years and they're very hit or miss.  I'd say everything is about average to disappointing.  Their ramen is actually pretty good, last time I had it.  Other than that, I'm not a huge fan."}
{"text":"Not an authentic Ramen, but I like what they have done with the food. Wonderful ambiance and great service and awesome bartenders."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are huge coffee drinkers and I often find myself at Lux down the street, decided to come in and try this little place after hearing some great reviews!
The hostess Rhyann was SO friendly and kept us company while we got seated immediately. The concept of the place is cozy but not too cramped, and I love the idea of the open kitchen with the bar. 

Our server was very helpful and led us to fall in love with the duck and roasted beets. I kept it simple with a chicken ramen, which with their house Sriracha was a nice little kick!

Try their banana foster bites too- delicious. 
Overall, come here for fast service and a unique but flavorful noodle and appetizer place. Great for date night."}
{"text":"The Clever Koi delivered on so many levels! We came in for lunch and based on a recommendation and the reviews we were hoping for a good bowl of ramen...we got our good ramen and a lot more!

Lunch has a build your own bowl concept that allows you to choose between noodles, stir fry, chilled noodles and rice. If you choose stir fry or chilled noodles you are ready to move on to your next step. If you select the rice option you need to decide if you want Fried or Steamed Rice, and also select between White and Brown. If however you choose the noodles section, you open yourself up to a few more options starting with noodle: Udon / Ramen / Gluten Free and continuing with the broth: Pork / Dashi (Veg) / Chicken. Once these decisions have been made you are ready to select your protein: Pork Belly / Lemongrass Chicken / Duck / Steak / Shrimp / Tofu. There is also a section for Veggies: Carrots / Mushrooms / Bean Sprouts / Bok Choy / Snow Peas / Broccoli / Bamboo Shoots. Finally there are a few extras you can add: Egg / Kimchi Pickled Ginger. The Bowls start at $5, Proteins are $3, Veg is $1 and Extras are $.50. We ordered two Noodle Bowels, one with Udon Noodle, Pork Broth, Pork Belly, Broccoli, Mushrooms, and an Egg. The broth was lovely--creamy and mouth coating, full of flavor, but still rather lite for a ramen pork broth. Noodle were good, as was the pork belly. Veggies were spot on and the egg was perfectly cooked--soft with a slightly runny center.

While we were still planning the options for are aforementioned bowls the server came by to explain the menu. First world famished as we were, we took the opportunity to order the Crispy Pig Face Dumplings with House Siriracha, Kimchi, and Scallions and the Goat Cheese & Roasted Beets with Miso Cashew Purée, and Daikon Sprouts from the Small Bites section of the menu. The Small Bites came out soon after we placed our order for the bowls, and were wonderful! We loved the house made sriracha!...the dumpling were full of flavors and depth with a nice contrast from the kimchi and scallions. The Goat Cheese & Roasted Beets were good, but they came with an exceptional (probably crack laced) miso cashew purée. The purée had the consistency of hummus and was so amazing that we would have taken jars of it home with us if was for sale.

I wasn't really planning on drinking, but it was readily evident that was a strong cocktail and drink program at the Clever Koi, so I took the occasion to order their Sloe Burn, made of Old Charter 8Yr / Plymouth Sloe Gin / Basil / Thai Bird Honey / Lemon. The menu describes it as spicy, with hints of cherry, anise + oak. I was thoroughly impressed with the balance of acid, sweet, heat, and alcohol. It made a great accompaniment to our enjoyable meal.

I think we came in right after they opened. We experienced a quiet lunch in a beautiful space. I can imagine Clever Koi becoming quite loud for dinner or evening drinks however. I don't think I'd enjoy that nearly as much, but as long as the kitchen can keep up, I would anticipate the food and drinks to be great."}
{"text":"My husband and I have traveled extensively and we love to find new foods and something different.  We found Koi to be a delightful experience, even though a little pricey.  We loved that they let us split entrees without extra plate fees.  We tried the Crispy Pineapple Duck, the Happy Hour Crab Po boy, and the Rabbit Gyoza.  they were all great dishes.  The fries with the po' boy were PERFECT.  My husband used to be a fry cook in a restaurant and he knows what fries should be like and ours were hot, crunchy and soft on the inside.  The duck was crispy, and even though it was a little spicy it was so well balanced that we weren't bothered by the heat.  The Gyoza was so rich and flavorful.  As we sat where we could see the kitchen we were watching plates coming out.  The manager came to see how we were doing and we asked about one of the dishes that was coming a lot, which he informed us was the calamari fries.  Then he brought us some to try.  The sauce was amazing and because they use the body rather than the tentacles, it was the best batch of calamari we've had.  The staff was great, the service was great and we were very happy."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have never been to a hipster type place like this before. I have to admit it was a bit overwhelming at first. Here are some Cons about this place I noticed. One, the parking and the lot were definitely not handicap friendly in my opinion. The restaurant it self was not very mobility device friendly either, which I was a tad bit nervous about. However, the staff made this situation work. They were all very pleasant and helpful. I was impressed with their willingness to help make me comfortable. Another thing was the homeless person who approached us during dinner. It was a bit uncomfortable having to turn away someone. Other than that this place had more good than bad. The Pros about this place are the people. The staff was wonderful and the guest were all so happy and friendly. We chatted with the couple next to us and a few others around us. Everyone was so delightful and cheery. The ambience was relaxing and quaint. I loved the patio set up with the heaters and the simple but cute decore. Now let's get to the nitty gritty. The food was heavenly. I am not one to go too far out of my comfort zone but I had a pretty epic night. Jan our server recommended a duck dish with pineapple sauce and a mushroom rice cake with roasted vegetables. I had never had duck that I can remember but she was so descriptive about the dish my mouth was watering. I just had to try this for myself. Let me say I was not the least bit disappointed. It was everything she said it would be. The meal was well prepared and the presentation was perfect. Sorry to say my pictures will not reflect that because I dug in before I remembered to snap a photo. My dad and brother both got some ramen. I had a small sample of both and I have to say the ramen was a perfect bowl of soup. All in all my experience was super and I do plan on returning. I almost forgot to mention our dessert. We had the banana foster fritters with red miso caramel sauce. These things were delicious. Bottom line I highly recommend this place. I only wish my photos did the food justice. Thank you Jan and staff for a wonderful first time."}
{"text":"This review is being wrote after the second time eating at the restaurant. Before I even walked in the restaurant, I loved the little \"plaza\" that The Clever Koi was in. It is an old existing building that contains two more businesses: Pour, a wine bar lounge and a hair salon. They all work well together.  The businesses all have floor to ceiling windows that face towards the center walk so it is easy to see people that may be joining your party and to create a more open urban feeling. Each time I go, it has been busy so you might want to call ahead and find out if there is a wait. One of my favorite items is the wings. They taste different than \"ordinary\" wings and it is not so many that you get full before your meal. A good one to share with one or two others. All the food at the table was fresh, flavorful and good portion size. One of my favorite dishes was a noodle dish called Spicy Seafood Hot Pot. It had a nice seafood flavor with a kick. The Clever Koi is classified as Asian-American comfort food and I think you will find it just that."}
{"text":"Clever Koi is located on this cool little stretch of Central Avenue in the same area as Central Wine Bar.  The decor is beautiful and well done, the staff is friendly and the food and drinks are quite good.  We tried the corn dog bites, the edamame fritters and the wood fired grilled plate for our entrees.  It was all pretty good, but nothing to rush back for.  However, the drinks were tasty and well mixed - I highly recommend the Marvin Gardens...yummy!

I will definitely be back for happy hour and hope the menu might get changed up a little bit."}
{"text":"Went here a celebration dinner and it was amazing! The service, drinks and food were awesome! We can't wait to come back and try everything. If you get anything get the steamed buns. They are all delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is my real review. 
It's a real problem. Yelp keeps taking it down.
But you need to know. 

Review: 

I can't say enough about the food here. 

It won't help. 

It wouldn't help cos, If you're reading this, you have no idea what Clever Koi is, and I don't have the patience to explain. 

I don't have time to explain, you see, because I just locked myself in and I can already taste the tremors. ULike nickels of blood in the back of your mouth. 

The fever hasn't hit yet but the checks in the mail that's for certain. 

In cases like these, you'll learn to appreciate a good, solid deadbolt. 

What I will tell you is this is an addiction. A life long fuck-all problem that you can never, ever, cure. 

The bite of a Koi, though without teeth, is a thick somnambulant drug administered liberally; a savory slow venom trickle down your spine which there is no known antidote. 

I was hooked instantly. One bite. 

Clever Koi is My heroine. 

I'm not gonna tell you how you're gunna crawl on your knees, begging like a mendicant at their door. 

There are some meals you will always chase. Somethings go to deep to be raised from your body like a tattoo lifted by a burning coat hanger. 

I can't help you. 

I'm not here to give you advice. 

There is a number you can call: #1-800-821-HELP. 

Maybe they can help. Talk you down. 

Maybe you're like me, without Betty Ford money or maybe you're to \"respectable\" to have such a scandal stain your families history. 

We're not here to judge. 

I do have something that might right you, temporarily. Get you back on your feet. For a short while.

How long it lasts, depends on you. 

I'll post the recipe below. Free. You don't owe me. 

There is no charge. But...

Maybe one day you help somebody. 

Somebody in the throws, skin leaking, bed shat, pleading 

(\"please, like, just a small score to sooth the pain, like.\")

& then fighting with you.

(\"I just need one more FUCKING HIT!\")

Give them this. I hope it helps. 

*RECIPE: 

The \"Sick-Boy\" Method: 
Relinquishing junk. Stage one, preparation.
For this you will need one room which you will not leave. Soothing music. 
Tomato soup, ten tins of. Mushroom soup, eight tins of, for consumption cold.
Ice cream, vanilla, one large tub of. Magnesia, milk of, one bottle. Paracetamol, mouthwash, vitamins. Mineral water, Lucozade, pornography. 
One mattress. 
One bucket for urine, one for feces and one for vomitus. 
One television and one bottle of Valium, which I've already procured from my mother, who is, in her own domestic and socially acceptable way also a drug addict.\"

And now You're ready.

As for me...heh, I Clever Koi is open...and I just need one for fuckin hit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  I couldn't wait for it to open and it was worth the wait, I love it!!  I've tried almost everything on the menu during my many visits and have so many favorites that it's always hard to decide what to eat!  I love the look and feel of the place and the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.  The complimentary valet is great because let's be real, every Phoenix restaurant has parking issues and with valet, you don't have to deal with finding a spot. The Clever Koi is doing it right and I will come back again and again with everyone I know, and you should too!"}
{"text":"I am here on business and discovered this place as it was close to my hotel and had a number of positive reviews. 
What did not expect was the attention to fresh creative details. Dumplings on a crispy delicious  bed of Kimchee, fresh herbs and onions and just the tight amount of heat.
So I came back..for their version of sweet and sour chicken. Expertly marinated and cooked without the cloying  sauce but with a clean moist and delicate flavor. Chicken is so often ruined (dry,over processed etc), that I was reluctant  to try it. 
I am smiling now that I have.
Finally, the staff and owners are beyond gracious and practice  the art of hospitality. If you have not eaten here..do so quickly, it will become your go to place. I wish they were in Seattle, so they could become  mine."}
{"text":"Went here today to take my wife for mothers day lunch. We got seated right away which is nice. I ordered the kimchi fried rice with steak, my wife ordered the pork ramen and for my daughter we ordered the fried rice with steak. We patiently waited for our orders but got really annoyed when we waited more than 30mins when we got our order. My wifes ramen wasn't really good. It was mediocre and seems very generic. What infuriates me was when I saw my order and my daughters order we both have the same amount of steak on our fried rice! Mind you i have to add $5 in my order just to get the steak on my kimchi fried rice and the kimchi fried rice doesn't even taste like kimchi! Its just like a fried rice from panda express and just add kimchi on it and viola kimchi fried rice ala koi. Never going back to this place again. They really lack in the taste department. Really had high expectations for this place but such a letdown. You are just paying for the ambiance but if you want good food i suggest going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm in town from San Diego and this place caught my eye online. When I showed up the environment is exactly what I like in a restaurant. I ordered the Pig Cheek dumplings ( the cheek is the most tender part of a pig) and they did not disappoint. Christina was my server and she was extremely helpful with navigating the menu. I also ordered a pork belly bao, the XO noodles, and some golden beet dessert. You can tell the Chef focuses on quality. I would definitely recommend this place and if I'm ever in Phoenix again I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Everything. the best. I like their non alcoholic ginger beer. The soft serve and fritter flavors change often. Everything is delicious. The Mongolian beef is a must..and for appetizers ..the pig face"}
{"text":"We loved our waitress... But the Staff was just horrid...Rude ,none greeting .. 2 people ordered a double order of chicken wings ,so that means 12 each... The girl that delivered the wings , Said heres the wings And started to put the wings down in front of every person.. I said NO these are double orders I get one and he gets one.. Then I said why didn't they just put them on 2 plates instead of 4.. She just looked at me and put the plates down and turned around and walked off.  I said hello ... Hello 3 times and she pretended not to hear me..I asked the waitress why she treated me like that ,,she said the skinny one??? she said no one likes her. Of course the waitress should have made sure that the order was placed as a double.. Not sure if ill go back"}
{"text":"Happy hour at The Clever Koi is on point. The second I saw a $5 bowl of ramen on the HH menu, I knew I HAD to get down there soon. For the price of a beer, at most places, you'll get a big ol' bowl of delicious and filling noodles with plenty of umami. Their ramen is filled with scrumptious mushrooms, pork, greens, and topped with a poached egg. When you're ready, pop that egg open, mix the yolk in a bit, and mow the eff down. Pair that with an order of their wings, served with kimchi ranch dressing, and inexpensive brews, and you have a party in your mouth! 

Go tonight! Once I'm down for their full dinner, I'll update!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pork belly bun and crispy duck with rice. The pork belly bun is yummy, not too greasy. The crispy duck though is a bit too hard and dry. But I really like the sticky rice that is mixed with mushroom."}
{"text":"Innovative Asian food in Phoenix. The female host was a little bit standoffish but the food was really good."}
{"text":"You can really taste the attention to detail and all the fresh ingredients they use to make each dish amazing"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place out. I even made a reservation because I figured it would be packed. Glad I mad the reservation it was very easy to do online on the website. The reason for the 3 stars is the food was not good at all! we ordered a couple appetizers and they were ok, my boyfriend and i both wanted the pork ramen, not tasty no flavor and i didn't realize the pork was just big thick bacon, it was sad that we paid a lot for it when i have better 87 cent ramen. I will give this place one more try because i think it was just what i ordered everything else on the menu look really good."}
{"text":"Overhyped but the food was still quality. Definitely overpriced for the small portions you receive."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party. Good vibe. Food was okay. I had duck and pineapple and it was good but portions are smaller. I don't think I would go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"The Clever Koi will reel you in with its soul satisfying ramen, cleverly named and crafted cocktails, and modern decor.
 
Walking up to the restaurant, past the artful logo painted on the facade, you'll find large glass windows through which you see trendy Asian inspired interiors abustle with activity. Whether you are in a group or on a date, find yourself a seat and ready yourself for delicious food and drink. The menu has an array of choices from small bites like steamed buns or Brussels sprouts to bowls of piping hot ramen. I settled on the cauliflower ramen with picked persimmon, cashews, and a soft boiled egg, which came on the side in a small bamboo dish. Oh lawd- the silky coconut milk broth, tang of pickled persimmon, tender crunch of cauliflower, and rich egg yolk came together in harmony in each bite. Let's just say there were zero leftovers. 

The experience was made complete by the excellent bar program with drinks like the Enabler- a delightfully rustic sipper with hickory smoked whiskey, grilled lemon, bitters and maple syrup. The sweetness from the maple played off the smoky whiskey in perfect balance. There are wines and beer too for the those not fancying the hard stuff.

By all means, when in Phoenix, step into the Clever Koi for an enjoyable and satisfying  evening"}
{"text":"Great spot and awesome vibe. The food is incredible and the service was some of the best I have ever had. My recommendation - ask for the recommendation from your sever. I did that for my cocktail selection, app selection, entree, and dessert. Each part of our meal had its own story and was just crazy good."}
{"text":"I have to say, it really hurts to give 3 stars because the food here is amazing. But I have been many times and always receive oddly poor service! I use that description because it's strange...the front of house staff is always super nice but also either I always seem to get forgotten or they forget to ring in my drink ...or my food. Every time I have been one of these three things has happened, which is a shame! As a server for many years, service really does make or break a place for me. Unfortunately last night I went straight to the Clever Koi after my workout so I was super hungry. Right when I was thinking our food hadn't been rung in, the bartender walked over and asked me what my order had been and I watched him ring it in. This was almost an hour after ordering! I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt since it was busy but - damn! Luckily I had good company with my friend and all was well, I just wish he had owned the mistake. I'll definitely be back for the amazing food but I'll also wait awhile until the memory of the friendly but slow service fades."}
{"text":"The service was less than stellar. Not to mention it's difficult to figure out who is a server because they are all dressed like runners. A little on the expensive side but the food and drink is pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  The drinks are always perfectly crafted.  The food is amazing.  So far I have tried the Blood Orange Chicken Wings, Spicy Tuna Chips, Chicken & Waffles steamed bun and Bananas Foster Fritters.  But the standout is the Pork Ramen.  It is THEE BEST bowl of anything in the valley.  The flavors and textures are amazing.  I don't know what my favorite component of this dish is...sometimes it's the egg, other times it's the kimchi and while I'm not a huge pork eater, the pork belly is so good!  Each visit the service was consistent and great.  We even braved the 4th of July crowds during the fireworks and the service was still the same when they were packed as it was during lunch on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"I love this place! If I could give it more stars I certainly would. I had dinner there last night which was the 3rd time I'd eaten there in about a month and as always, everything exceeded my expectations. They have got it down pat, amazing food, awesome service, (both front of the house and back) and owners and employees who are passionate about their restaurant! This was my first time sitting at the kitchen bar, where I could see the guys in the kitchen who work so hard. It is obvious watching them prepare the food that they are completely engaged and dedicated. Chef Jared Porter is one of Phoenix's best, if not the best, in my opinion. He continues to create fresh, flavorful dishes using exceptional ingredients put together in such interesting ways. I crave this food, it's like comfort food without being heavy like most comfort food tends to be. We started out with a couple of the \"small plates\", Tuna Chips and the Black Bean and Celery Root Pancakes. For the record, I have ordered these the last 3 times I've been there, they are that amazing! For dinner we shared the Fried Forbidden Black Rice, what a perfect pairing of flavors, slightly sweet, incredibly flavorful without being salty or spicy. Honestly, I love their flavor combinations as much as anything else about the place. We ordered the Grilled Stone Fruit dessert which totally hit the spot, not overly sweet, but sweet enough, with just the right balance of sweet and savory. Not only is the food amazing, but it seems as though every person on staff is happy to be there and cares about the guests. This might be my favorite restaurant, at least until I try their new spot when it opens in Gilbert in the early fall."}
{"text":"On a spur of the moment, a few Friday nights ago, my husband and I popped into Clever Koi. This restaurant had long been on my , 'must try' list and I was happy we finally agreed to see what it was all about. We did not make a reservation and at first , I was bummed because the super friendly hostess said it would be a good 40 - 50 minute wait. I am not a patient person and I hate waiting. The bar was also standing room only. I knew that meant good things awaited us. I did notice , upon walking in, Central Bar is right next door so when the hostess took our name and asked what kind of table would be our first choice, I asked if we could leave our number because we would be at Central Bar. Well, better yet, she said she would come get us when our table was ready! About 40 minutes later we were sat in the very lively Clever Koi after she retrieved us from next door. Now that's service! The decor is dimly lit and the vibe is high energy and chic. Everyone from the hostess to the wait staff are cool and friendly. To start with I tried the Singapore Sling: gin; agricanto cherry; cointreau ; benedictine ; pineapple and a little grenadine. This drink will remind you of a beachy climate under a palm tree .. it will also buzz you up! It's a little sweet and sneaky strong. Overlooking the menu at Clever Koi, this isn't the Americanized chinese food you find all around. It's Asian fusion and very unique with some of its offerings and ingredients. I liked that the Clever Koi and its team use local ingredients as much as possible to support the local community. That means fresh and organic.
For the most part, many of the dishes are small plate in concept unless you go for the noodle or rice dishes. I seriously wanted to try it all! My husband and I started with the Soft Shell Crab and Chicken / Waffle Steamed Buns. These come out in little taco type 'stands' to your table. My soft shell crab steamed bun was out of this world with taste! It had just the right amount of alioli , cucumber slaw over this crisp soft shelled crab and at $4 the price isn't bad for getting more than one! My husband's chicken & waffle steamed bun was good, but not my favorite. The 'bun part' is actually a kimchi waffle around the chicken drizzled with chile maple and a little scallion. I also ordered the Pig Face Dumpling: These come four per order for $9. Pig Face to me is another way of saying, 'pork cheeks'. This was a steamed bun and inside was amazing tender pork and so much flavor! We shared a Crispy Pineapple Duck Rice. This dish is like crispy rice with crispy leg of duck , carrots, eggplant and mushroom and placed on the plate in such a presentable way, you almost don't want to it because it looks so pretty! This dish was also very tasty! Truly there is so much here on Clever Koi's menu , we found it hard to choose. It's a way to take your foodie taste buds on a culinary adventure, for sure , and I always recommend trying new and adventurous things like that! There are more main stream dishes here in case some of the items are too 'off the norm ' for you like Pad Thai or even Ramen, which for a second, when the table next to me got their ramen, I stared hard and wondered if I was gonna have that food envy and sorrow of not getting that when my order arrived ! Well, where as I do not even discount that those ramen bowls were amazing , my choices were out of this world! My tip: Make a reservation! You will wait on a Friday or Saturday night and likely other nights too! This place is ultra cool and has amazing cool dishes to go along with it... you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What isn't great about this place, really? I've been here 3 times now and I have yet to be disappointed. The food is delicious, they have a wooden grill inside that you can observe them cooking on. The specials of the day are so great, but they go fast! 

There are so many different routes to go down to experience the flavors of their menus, so I recommend going with some friends so you can try a little bit of everything!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I just ordered amazing things but I remember really liking this place. I went for happy hour a few months ago and had a delicious drink with pimms cup, edamame fritters, the vegetable grill with shrimp, and then of course the chicken and waffles with kimchi...and I actually ordered two orders of those because they were that good. I sat at the bar and service was great. I wouldn't recommend this place for children, but I did see a few couple with their small babies on date night. Overall, totally going back."}
{"text":"The entire menu is can't miss. I find myself waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat craving the pork belly steam buns and pig face dumplings. And their lunch menu is fantastic. You can go as a date or with a group. You can explore the ridiculously well curated drink menu for happy hour. The service is always on point. If you haven't gone yet, you should. You will find yourself unable to sleep until you get more dumplings."}
{"text":"The Clever Koi has some absolutely outstanding dishes (anything with pork belly is delicious!) and some more average appetizers. We eat here at least once a month, especially Monday and Tuesday night (they no longer offer it on Wednesday) since their 'It takes 2' special is an excellent deal. As a bonus they have great outdoor seating. 

I recommend their Steam Pork Belly Bun, Kimchi Fried Rice with Pork Belly & Duck Curry."}
{"text":"We originally were headed to George & Dragon but after sitting and waiting for service for 15 min, we walked next door to the Koi. We were immediately approached, seated, and given menus. Impressive! Ambiance on the patio was great and our server was super nice. 
The food was outstanding! We had the pig's head dumplings which were wonderful and the lemongrass chicken was tender and tasty. We will go back!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this new place since I love all Asian cuisine. I went there with a group of my girl friends for happy hour and dinner. We all ordered different things. Buns, dumplings, chicken wings, kimchi fried rice, beet salad, chicken katsu and sadly everything was blaaaaaahnd!!! No flavor at all. I will give them a star for their bar and unique drinks. Living in downtown, I love to stay downtown and eat local. But sadly I will not be returning to eat at Clever Koi. I would go back only for the bar."}
{"text":"I tried there Pork Ramen. The only thing that was good was then pork belly with the red sriracha sauce. The broth of the ramen did not event taste like ramen and the noddles were not too special. The kimchi was horrific. It was bad enough for me to spit it out and not eat the rest of any of it. The tastes was no where close to kimchi but the taste alone was just bad. 

This is the food review however I would give the service a 4.5 star. The younger lady was very kind and very accommodating.
The GM was kind enough to pay for my ramen and give me an additional coupon for the future. I'll definite have to come back and try something new. And hopefully make a better review"}
{"text":"As I promised to myself, I came back to The Clever Koi for Happy Hour and I am glad that I did. Visiting again and trying different dishes from the first time has changed my opinion. 

We ordered the Pork Ramen, Spicy Tuna Chips, and Soft Shell Crab Po'Boy from the Happy Hour menu. From the regular dinner menu we ordered the Tempura Catfish Steamed Buns. I enjoyed every dish we ordered this time around. 

Tempura Catfish Steamed Buns - devoured these warm steamed buns with crispy, perfectly fried catfish and fantastic tartar sauce very very quickly

Pork Ramen - great, chewy noodle texture, fantastic crispy pork belly, and excellent soft boiled egg again

Spicy Tuna Chips - not very spicy and very tasty when you get that perfect bite with the ahi tuna, wasabi guacamole on the rice paper chip

Soft Sell Crab Po'Boy - nicely fried crab but a little too much aioli sauce for me

On top of enjoying the food, I enjoyed their house hot sauces. So much in fact, that I bought a bottle of their sriracha. I will definitely be back for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out. Too much noise though and it takes time to calm down. Over all its a good place to hang out. Good food and drinks."}
{"text":"Small drinks, big prices. Okay food, not great. $55 for two drinks and a few snacks. Meh. Decent atmosphere. Saw quite a few women struggle with opening their front door, but that may have been purposefully done so men could be a bit chivalrous and actually open the door like they are supposed to. Not clever enough for me to return for more."}
{"text":"Great, I mean GREAT bar and service.  The cocktails are amazing, expressive details even down to filtered water and it seems like they make their own filtered water ice cubes. Very important in Phoenix. We ordered the Udon Duck Curry, which we admired the ingredients but not so much the execution of and would not order again- but we also ordered the Pad Thai with scrambled egg and Lemongrass Chicken which was AMAZING. I could eat this LEMONGRASS CHICKEN FOR EVERY MEAL. DELICIOUS.  I also rate restaurants on their bathrooms= 10 stars A++. It's a great place, check it out :)"}
{"text":"Had such a great time here. We are just traveling from California and of course looked to yelp for help. We wanted to find great food spots... very glad we chose this place! Loved everything about the place! 
Name, ambience, service, food and the drinks!! It's legit mixology and not just shake shake serve. I loved my tall drinks. I sat at the bar and watched my bartender make our drinks and he made em with meticulous care which I appreciated. They all looked very good and tasted so good. It's a great feeling being excited about what you're ordering and this place definitely made me feel excited lol Classy feel inside sippin on my yummy yummy cocktails and eating delicious food after driving from Page, AZ. 
Love the date-night feels of the place but it doesn't cater to JUST that. about to google if they have a branch in California.. probably not. :(

Only warning is pricing. It's not bad! But do know that good meal plates run from 15-20 bucks and drinks are $11. Experience was worth it! 
Got the yakisoba and added lemongrass chicken which was bomb! Calamari fries were 90% real squid and only 10% breading which was nice Lol!
Short ribs and lamb were enjoyed by my bf as well!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this restaurant before and I was excited to see there was another location in Gilbert. We loved the idea of free parking and decided to try out this location.

The Clever Koi is located next to Even Stevens by the parking garage. If you are visiting on a busy night, I suggest parking in the dirt lot since it's closer and less of a hassle than the parking garage. 

We arrived on a Friday night and it was a bit busy. Luckily for us, it was a beautiful night and they had plenty of patio seating. As we headed outside, we got a wonderful vibe from the inside of the restaurant. There is a large bar area and comfortable seating throughout the restaurant. You can see the entire kitchen and the lighting is calming with a subtle warm feeling. 

They have decent variety on their menu from drinks to meals. The drink menu has a variety of mixed drinks to take you on an adventure. I know they offer a happy hour menu but we showed up afterwards. We decided to get a scorpion bowl and it did not disappoint. The drink is made for two and is served in a large bowl. The entire drink is adorned with garnishes such as mint, orange peels and orange slices. The middle of the bowl had a lime that was turned inside out with brandy in the middle. The best part, the brandy was set a blaze! This is a crowd-pleaser and it is delicious!

The dinner menu has a large selection and we were so torn on what to order that we ordered a while variety of items. We even had a few friends join us for dinner and they offered vegan options for them on a separate menu. I decided to order the Hokkaido street style corn, Golden Beet and Persimmon Tart and the Chicken and Waffle Bun. My husband ordered the Red Miso Seared Kobe, the Thai Chili Beef and the Soft shell Crab Bun. Our friends ordered the Fall Vegetable Ramen.

The Hokkaido Street Corn was lightly grilled, adorned with cheese and an amazing aoli sauce. It was a little pricey but it did not disappoint. The Chicken and waffle was an interesting blend of flavors. From the Kimchi waffle that added a savory tough to the glazed chicken with a soft burn, it was amazing! I'm usually not a fan of spicy foods but this was perfect. The highlight of my dinner was the Golden Beet and Persimmon Tart. The shell had a blend of Matcha that was perfect with the vegetables hidden inside. The syrup is placed around the tart and the goat cheese is on the side. This dish was so perfect, that I am still craving another helping the next day! The Beef dishes were amazing because the beef was cooked perfect. Cooked enough but still a little bid of red to give it a superb flavor. The rice dish even had Green Onion coated in Tempura. It's like a glorified onion ring that is just brilliant! 

We ended the night with Banana Fritters accompanied by Miso Red Been Caramel glaze. It blended perfectly but it was scrumptious!

The wait staff was diligent and everyone helped to make our dinner relaxing. Just remember that if you are on the patio on the weekend, don't be surprised by some rowdy teenagers wandering around the area.

The prices are little high but you are getting wonderful quality food. I can't wait to go back and try some items that I didn't get a chance to try. Though, the Golden Persimmon Beet Tart is now my favorite staple from this establishment. Love this location too!"}
{"text":"-Has a swanky, sophisticated décor and ambiance without being cold or intimidating
-delicious, accessible drinks for a variety of tastes
-I enjoyed The Enabler and The Pare It Down.
-\"small\" plates are not so small: plentiful and scrumptious offerings
-We devoured the Brussels sprouts, spicy tuna chips and the pigface dumplings.
-Our server, Ralph, was knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"Easy parking in back.  

Trendy but not off-putting.  Comfortable surroundings.  

Get there before 5:30 p.m. on weekends and you won't need a reservation.  

Had the pork belly chow mein - perfect.  Ordered extra pork belly to go with my doggie bag leftovers, and they gave me three times the original amount of pork belly!"}
{"text":"I like to drink.  With such territory comes the eternal crossroads of either needing a solid libation, or something to soak up my now twisted and spinning reality.  With this being said, Clever Koi offers the best solutions to both of these predicaments.  Actually, I'll take that a step further - they offer both, at the same time.  I'm not talking cheap and satisfying \"you call it's\" and 2AM breakfast burritos that you hope the microwave killed off any and all of the handlers bacteria...let alone the syphilis growing in those ripened eggs.  

No sir, this place is the bees knees.  My girlfriend's favorite date night spot.  Their cocktails are a symphony of flavors.  Kind of like Method Man's album \"Tical.\"  Their food?  Just stop.  Stop, Chef...I think Jared, I don't know, I'm usually drunk there.  You're too much.  It ain't right.  It ain't fair.  It ain't holy.  The Pork Ramen?  It's so good I think it ghost writes for Drake.  If anyone else tried to sell me a black bean & celery root pancake, I'd call in bomb threats from their mamas phone to the nearest Wal-Mart - no, AJ's (appeals to a broader elite) - until the cops circled the house of that breeder of such a limp-wristed individual.  But not this one.  Chef...we're sticking with Jared, has concocted something delicious in that dish.  I recommend it to the most savagely meat-headed of 'roided out individuals just to watch their reality crumble.

A lot of places try to rest on the laurels of hip décor and staff with nice beards.  Clever Koi takes both of these and says, hey man, we're pretty AND smart.  Know what I mean?  Roman is a dope bartender too.  Props on his Diamondbacks loyalty, cuz' they suck.  Know what doesn't suck though?  That guy.  I witnessed him a while back deal with two drunkards (more than myself, wow) at the bar top flashing all shades of unnecessary rudeness, like people tend to do when they're being served.  Handled it like the suave pro that he is.  They'll be back, I guarantee it.  Every week.  And it'll kill the staff slowly.  But hey, dolla dolla bills yo.

Plus, they're right next to George and Dragon.  Which offers really cheap rum and cokes, and jager bombs.  So when you're trying to drunkenly look for Pokémon with your girlfriend in Indian Steele park, you can walk right over from ze Koi, load up on cheap booze, and proceed to dodge the homeless denizens of the park.  If I had one knock on Clever Koi, now that I think about it, it'd be that they don't have jager.  Props to them for keeping it classy.

Their bathrooms are also more artistic than that hole you call a home.

Good brunch too."}
{"text":"The Clever Koi is just plain sexy. Seriously. 

Come here for dinner and you'll see what I mean. From the floor-to-ceiling windows to the warm lighting to the unique cocktails, it just oozes sultry class.

Now onto the food. I'll admit it, when I first ate at Clever Koi I tried to play it safe and was not overly impressed by the chow mein with tofu. It was a little oily and tasted mainly of lemongrass. The next time I went, I committed to the true fusion experience and had the edamame & kale dumplings with the corn ramen. It was unreal. The flavors were bold and innovative, but familiar in the best way. 

If I can give any advice when you eat here, look for dishes that aren't necessarily in your comfort zone and just go for it!"}
{"text":"After living like 10 feet away for six months, my fiancé and I finally made time to try Clevor Koi, and I'm so glad we did!

We went around 7p on a Friday night, and though it was very crowded, we were seated right away. I loved that it felt private and not too loud, but was also full of people. It was a really fun atmosphere. It was also cool to be able to see the chefs working in the kitchen, I always think that's fun. Our servers were awesome as well; our plates were always cleared super fast, and we never had a chance to finish our water before they brought more!

For an appetizer, we ordered the Confit Wings (#1). These were delicious! You could taste the duck fat, which I haven't had before, but I thought it was really good, and I loved the siracha sauce. For dinner my fiancé ordered the Spicy Seafood Hot Pot, which he really liked, but thought was hard to eat lol. Neither of us know what we're doing with chopsticks. I got the House Pad Thai with tofu, and that was really good as well! 

If I'm being honest, while we thought the food was really good, we didn't love it, but that's just because we haven't had a ton of authentic Asian food (even though they say they're Asian-inspired I felt like it was really authentic), so maybe it's just not our thing! 

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fun dinner! It's on the expensive side I think, but I loooved the restaurant itself, and do want to go back to try more of the menu options. I need to try the cocktails, too!  :)"}
{"text":"A dinner at clever koi is an unforgettable experience, not to be missed. It's a nice looking restaurant, the food is fantastic, and you'll be thinking about it long after the meal is over. We started with the dumpling which was unique and curiously flavored. 

My main course, The seafood hot pot, was tender, moist pieces of calamary steak, smothered in a delicious broth with tomato, honey, cardamom and what I'm assuming was a pound of laxatives. I haven't stopped shitting since 9:30PM of last night.

Nasty white chick in dreads working at the kitchen seemed to shed her locks as she proceeds to cook poorly seasoned dishes that tore through my anal cavity with the awesome fury of the Horsemen of the apocalypse. Well done I say. By the way I never received one single smile from the serving staff. But, who needs smiles if they're serving foods of this caliber. 

Someone saw that we did not touch our food, after some initial examination. The manager sent us his compliments, dessert of deep-fried bread balls, to be dipped in delectable exotic caramel sauce, which incinerated everything in my intestines. My morning was an unforgettable thrill ride. Mostly from the comfort of my bathroom. Semi-private. I have roommates. 

The exotic flavors and aromas of Asia came flooding back to me as I literally peed out of my butt.

If you are portly or tall, or simply a gentleman of indiscriminate palate, or simply someone who suffer from chronic incontinent, this is the place. Simply start your meal with anything on the menu...you're either taste your food yet again upon its exit from your mouth hole, or your anus shall afford the pleasure once the curious spices of Clever Koi lands in the lower intestines."}
{"text":"I really liked the idea of this. First pass is 3 stars, but need to go back."}
{"text":"Wow !!!  Must try !!! Eclectic / Tasty Cuisine.  Absolutely phenomenal drink selection, and great selection of scotch.  One of my new favorites."}
{"text":"We were out on Saturday evening for dinner. The misters in patio provide good cooling experience on warm evening. 

This was first time at the location. Glad to see they do cater to vegetarians. We had the corn dumplings and muscles for appetizers. Muscles were good. The dumplings were over fried and nearly burned. We also put an order for drink. The dinner came before drink. So we canceled the drink order. 

Overall it was okay experience."}
{"text":"This place helped me remember why I avoid Asian fusion restaurants. The concept is great, but many places cannot execute well, including this one.

Pork belly ramen: The poached egg on top was disturbingly cold and off-putting. Nice big, fatty and meaty pieces of pork belly. Noodles were fine. The broth was way too salty and lacking flavor. 2.5

Sriracha wings: Not spicy at all, kind of sweet. Crispy, which was nice. 3.5

Soft shelled crab small plate: loved the flavors on this one- spicy, tart, and savory. 4

Forbidden rice bowl: Shrimp did not taste fresh. Weird flavors. Better at Flower Child. 1

Very slow service. We were there around dinnertime and the food took a really long time to come out even though there were only 2 other tables filled."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding. Their duck curry and hot pot are amazing, their appetizers are perfect, and the service is great as well. Probably some of the best modern Asian cuisine I have found in AZ."}
{"text":"At first I was nervous - I don't tend to risk it too much with Asian food, but I loved every piece of dinner here. When we walked in, we were immediately seated. The staff brought waters within a minute of us sitting down. The waiter thoroughly explained the menu of options available, and provided his recommendations on the best entrées they have.

The atmosphere was very clean yet unique. It definitely had an Asian zing to it. It was quiet, easy to engage in conversations with. They have indoor and outdoor seating.

And we did not feel rushed. The staff kept refilling our drinks and allowing us to feel comfortable while we engaged in conversation for a while after we finished dinner.

I will definitely be back and will tell friends about Clever Koi."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner and been here for happy hour.  

Setting:  5 Star - modern, clean, cool, beautiful - everything you want in a trendy hot restaurant.

Service:  5 Star - nice staff, attentive management, felt welcome

Food:  3-4 Star - Everything is pretty good.  Small portions.  Most things are clearly premade and just reheated, which makes sense for many items.  

Value:  2-3 Star - Except on Happy Hour, everything just felt too expensive for the quality of food and quantity.  Not terribly expensive, but just expensive.  It's tapas size portions, which is fine, but when you are paying $8-9 for a tapas size portion, it adds up!


I've been here twice.  First time I ate the regular menu on a daddy-daughter night out, and that was nice.  I enjoyed most things on the menu that I tried.  I had noticed the happy hour menu/prices, and was excited to try.

Second time, came back with two kids and wife for happy hour.  

NOTE:  Menu has changed, and is NOT the same as is on their website.  It's more expensive now!

Happy Hour prices seem to have gone up a couple bucks per item.  No longer a great deal, just an okay one.

We ordered beers and mixed drinks.  Tasty all round.

We ordered three orders of the pork soup, which was good but the ramen sure tasted a lot like the stuff you get at a supermarket, even if everything around it was top notch.

All the appetizers were tasty.  Just not outstanding.

So two kids, two adults, two drinks.  $80 with tip.  Filled us up.

My wife, who usually isn't one to be cheap, said:  \"That didn't feel like it was worth the $80.\"

I wavered a bit and would probably agree, but at the same time I didn't feel like it was terrible for what we ate.  Just don't go back thinking happy hour is some amazing deal.  

It WAS, then the owner raised prices. 

But if you have a very light appetite, I could think of a LOT worse places to go for Happy Hour (which goes till 7) on a date."}
{"text":"This is an updated review of my previous review. Shortly after I detailed my dining experience at the Gilbert location, the owners reached out and invited me to try alternative dishes, taking into consideration that I have a more traditional palate when it comes to Korean food. 

Off the bat, I was impressed that they showed interest in turning my disappointing encounter into a positive one. Their invitation was sincere and humble. This time I took my teenage daughter with me to help me navigate through the various flavors. 

I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised the second time around. As I said before, the restaurant is beautiful and trendy, great vibes. Our server was attentive and polite, and again, we had excellent service. Nick, one of the owners, shared some insight on how they decided on an Asian fusion theme, which was interesting. You can tell he really cares about creating a unique and special culinary adventure for the every day patron. 

I ordered duck Curry on brown rice, which was amazing. Not too spicy, just enough kick. My daughter ordered kimchi fried rice, which she enjoyed. We had three steamed buns as an appetizer. Those were a treat--the bun is so fluffy and soft, feels like you just bit into a cloud! My favorite was the crab steamed bun. 

It's official. I have decided that I will be back again. The \"Clever Koi\" has convinced me that they deserve props when it comes to paying homage to traditional Asian dishes, but with a modern twist."}
{"text":"Modern Asian done right! Great environment, vast menu with all sorts of delicious choices. I'm a huge fan of Chicken & Waffles anything, so I was glad to see the steamed bun option, although it was simply a folded waffle with chicken inside, but delicious nonetheless and the chili Maple really made it. The Black Vinegar Barbecue Ribs were also spectacular, they fell right off the bone. For my meal I had the Pork Belly Ramen, with kimchi, bamboo shoots and a soft egg, I haven't had much Ramen so I wasn't sure what to think, I personally prefer pho but it wasn't bad, just thicker. In any case, I'd definitely go back and try a few other items, whether on a date or for a friendly dinner, it seems to suit both occasions just fine."}
{"text":"Great service! Great decor! Food was very fresh. My only reason for the 3 stars is the prices were very high for such small portions. I had two beers and chow mein(which said with choice of protein). I was charged $4 extra for the chicken and $10 per Kieran beer. Ended up around $44 for one person! I can't afford to go back and give it another try at this rate."}
{"text":"The Clever Koi has my heart! Came here on a Saturday for happy hour (4pm - 6pm). What can I say... I was impressed by every detail of this restaurant. No wait. The modern Asian decor. The friendly and attentive service. I can go on. 

Their happy hour menu features so many great dishes AND drinks which to me says a lot because I feel that some restaurants are so minimal on their happy hour menus. I came here with my family, a party of 5. We ordered everything on the happy hour food menu to share (5 dishes, minus the wood grilled veggies). The pork ramen was so good, we ordered 2! We all were fighting for the last bit. We added a kimchi fried rice with pork belly which was so good, I want to try it again with the other proteins. From rave reviews, we ordered each steamed bun (5) for each one of us and WOW! Just wow. So full of flavor like all the other dishes. And the greatest part, is that all of these dishes plus 3-4 drink orders came out to exactly $100. I was expecting much more! I am surprised that Clever Koi isn't swamped for happy hour on a Saturday! I won't accept coming here any other way. And I will definitely be back for more.

I enjoyed this restaurant experience from start to finish! Can't wait for the next."}
{"text":"I loved trying the different Ramen options. My husband and shared different items. Not a place for kids."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. Interesting non-traditional Asian-fission dishes, reasonably priced.  We had the build your own bowel. We are definitely returning soon."}
{"text":"My husband, and I where in the area and we were on a mission. My husband was up to trying something new. I just wanted to enjoy a real meal, which was not a run of the mill standard choice. The Clever Koi rose to the call on both of our wants for the night.  We arrived late in the evening (close to their closing time) and we where seated immediately. We liked that our table faced the open kitchen. Since this was our first experience at the Clever Koi our server made recommendations for appetizers and dinner, we took her up on both options. 

The appetizer recommendation was the Pork Belly Bun.  Seriously when we heard they offered this we where SOLD, seriously all I have to say is wow. We have had Pork Belly before and it is best to enjoy it, immediately after is presented.  Okay you should wait for the plate to hit the table first..... ha ha but I'm sure if you don't it would be understood.  So why the high praise? It is because Pork Belly in itself takes time to reach the combined perfection of a crispy sear and doneness. When this is done, your first bite, simply melts in your mouth. Seriously we thought this was a great way to start off, for our first visit ever. 

Oh wait but there is more, for dinner we both ordered the Crispy Pineapple Duck. So to put it plainly IT WAS AMAZING the duck was tender, the vegetables combined in the layered manner that it was, did not take away from the duck but enhanced it immensely. Let me just say this, you know when that moment hits and you just look at your husband (partner in crime) and there is just that silent understanding that you both just get it? Well we both had that moment of DON'T TALK TO ME, I'M EATING and silence hit our table and the only noise you heard was mmmm and sighs of indulgence or OMG!! Nothing like the \"Harry Meet Sally\" diner moment but pretty dang close.  Okay so here are the burning questions we will answer  for you.

1. Was our mission a success? Yes, yes it was
2.     Will we go back to the Clever Koi? Yes.  
3. What will we try? Hopefully, more of their menu listing's.
4. Would we recommend this restaurant ? In a heartbeat.
5. Was it pricey? Depends on the value, you put on a memorable meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Clever Koi last night with such high hopes after reading the great reviews and hearing firsthand from friends how supposedly awesome it is. My husband has recently become a big fan of ramen and I read somewhere that this place was voted the best for ramen in Phoenix. With all that said, we were both left extremely disappointed, and not with just one thing, with pretty much EVERYTHING! I usually can find something redeeming enough about every place I visit, therefore, will often try places again even if I wasn't impressed the first time. About the only good thing I can say about this place is that it appears to be clean, there was no wait (though now I understand why), and the host was very friendly. Unfortunately, these are not good enough reasons for me to feel like I should give this place a second chance when everything else pretty much sucked. We waited at least 15 minutes to be acknowledged by our server who walked past our table several times and said nothing. When she did finally acknowledge us, she didn't even come to our table. She turned around while walking away and said she would bring us waters. We waited for several more minutes for our waters which someone else brought. We had been ready to order for some time but our server continued to ignore us even though she passed by our table several more times. When we did finally get to order, she wasn't personable at all, gave very short answers, and just acted as though we were an inconvenience. Now on to the food and drink... Let me begin by saying I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to food. It takes alot for me to say I hate something and to not finish a meal. I've eaten many crappy meals for the sake of just eating something and as long as it's edible, I'll try to finish. Same goes for drinks. Please keep that in mind. We ordered the mushroom dumplings, the drink with the egg white froth (can't remember what it was called), a bellini, the pork ramen, and the xo noodles. The mushroom dumplings were tiny and the sauce that accompanied them was bland. Worst dumplings I've ever had and pretty expensive for what we received. Husbands drink was tiny and my bellini was way too lemony. The ramen noodles looked like what you'd get from the grocery store, the meat was overcooked, and the dish in general was just not that great in flavor compared to other ramen we've had at restaurants. This was not a ramen that should be touted as the best ramen in Phoenix and was absolutely not worth 15.00. Additionally, the kimchi in the ramen didn't belong. Needless to say, my husband didn't eat much. Lastly, the xo noodles were disgusting. I had no problem with them being a bit spicy but all I tasted was overpowering spice, grease, and salt. The \"sauce\" was nothing more that oil which pooled underneath the noodles. There were supposed to be scallops and shrimp... I found maybe 3 tiny tiny scallops (Olive garden gives bigger scallops and that's not saying much) and 6 baby shrimps in the entire dish. At one point, there was something I tasted in the noodles which left a lingering, strong, bitter flavor in my mouth. I had a hard time getting past that and couldn't figure out what it was. After that, I stopped eating even though I still had half a dish of noodles left. I just couldn't continue due to how bad it was. We waited awhile for the check, with our server passing by several more times (surprise). She finally asked if we wanted a box and we said no. Now maybe I'm just being overly picky or maybe I expect too much from servers but typically, a good server will notice if most of the food was untouched and ask if everything was really ok. This server didn't but in all honesty, I don't know that she really cared. In any event, we paid 65.00 (not including tip... yes I left a tip though it was minimal) for a terrible meal and walked away still hungry. Suffice it to say, I have absolutely no interest in returning. To say this place is overrated is a severe understatement. It was a complete waste of not only my money but time."}
{"text":"If I could have their chow main every day for dinner - I would. Fabulous flavor. Service very good. The sweet thing banana fritters are fabulous ( though the carmel sauce could be less sweet.) Easy parking. 
I have been eating here many many times and never have enough. 
Great cocktails and the bar area."}
{"text":"Clever Koi has a great atmosphere and amazing food. What I love about it is how different their menu is and how friendly the staff is. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've eaten hear about 6 times (haven't been in about 6 months), and always get the same thing, the Vegetable Ramen. I was disappointed during my last visit, it was different. The broth was a bland, 
(veggies were good), missing that charred tomato flavor, and really oily. The noodles were overcooked and stuck together in big clumps. Hopefully it was just an off night. Tried the Kimchi Fried Rice, that was awesome! Pina Coladas are delicious. Mary was our server, she was very nice and quick. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place and cannot wait to go back! The customer service was incredible and the food was so delicious! This place is very busy so make sure you make reservations, yes even during the week! Must try is the Banana Fritters and apps!"}
{"text":"Thank God after a terrible election we at least have Clever Koi in Gilbert now!!! My favorite Asian place in all the land."}
{"text":"Where do I start?...Hubby & I came in last night for date night & everything exceeded expectations. We both had a drink: him-Manhattan, me-Lemongrass Swizzle which I cannot stop raving about! Perfect blend of crisp, bright & refreshing! We had the tuna chips for an appetizer aka sushi nachos. Great flavor & perfect size. Hubby ordered the steak chow mein & I had the fried forbidden black rice. Both dishes were exquisite. The atmosphere was relaxed & intimate. It's a great spot for date nights or dinner with friends! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"It's a trendy asian fusion restaurant with unique menu items and creative drinks.

We started with the pig face and goat cheese dumplings.

The pig face was pretty average. Although pork belly and hoisin sauce is amazing the whole dish was overpowered by the sriracha but the goat cheese dumplings were great! The goat cheese was super creamy and melty while the sweetness of the beats were a perfect compliment. 

I have an obsession with ramen so I try to order it everywhere I go, so naturally I got the pork ramen. The broth was average but the pork belly was cooked decently. They also put kimchi in the dish and although I love kimchi, I think I would of preferred it without. 

Overall it's an a nice place, good ambiance for dates or a casual dinner with drinks."}
{"text":"Came here on my boyfriends birthday with high expectations, but they were sadly let down. Starting with the positives-- the ambience was beautiful, the services was very pleasant and the drinks were good! However, the food was not as tasty as I thought it would be. We got a fried rice bowl that had an odd flavor and our dumplings had a very strong dissatisfying taste with tons of grease. I ended up paying a lot for the food which made it even more upsetting. BUT that doesn't mean you won't like it if you try!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time tonight amazing... Zach made excellent recommendations.  The flavors are outstanding..  Even if you don't live in Phoenix it's worth the trip  just to eat here.. I ordered the pig face dumplings..  We tried all four of the buns and I got Ramen and I loved everything.. slow clap ..."}
{"text":"Wow - what a mind blowing experience. Duck fat chicken wings. Fresh crab steamed buns. Attentive server who made sure we were fully present to attend to their happy hour specials. High quality old fashioned accompanied our Asian fusion indulgences. Tasty meal."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, everything was delicious. The best thing we had was the pork belly bun, you HAVE to make sure you try one. My Husband had the spam bun as well and he loved it as well. The service was amazing, our glasses were never empty and we never went more than 5 minutes without someone filling a drink or changing out napkins. We will be back for sure, I need another pork bun in my life."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance.  Great selection of food.  Staff was professional and attentive.  Recommend the chef counter, if available, for a \"show.\"  Love the chicken & waffle, the lettuce cups and the fried black rice.  Will def come again the next time we visit Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Mon was my 2nd time here. Our experience the 1st time, more than a year ago, was a mixed bag: the food was great, but the servers seemed disorganized. They got our drink orders wrong 3 times. 

This time the service was better, but it still seems the wait staff somewhat stumbles over each other, figuratively speaking. It's like servers are not dedicated to a set of tables, but rather take turns, which doesn't lend itself well to service continuity. At one point we waited about 15 minutes for someone to come over and ask if we wanted addItional drinks. The staff was friendly and helpful, however, so 3.5 stars for service. 

I thought the cocktails were on the weak side (I had 3 different ones and they all suffered from this issue), so 3 stars there. The food, on the other hand, was even better than I had remembered it. I had the soft shell crab po' boy, and the pork belly and tempura catfish bao buns, all of which were delicious. The fries were some of the best I've had in PHX. 5 stars for the food.

Ambiance was a 5: great location, cool space and decor, very busy (for a Mon) as the night progressed (we were there from 5 until 8:30), acceptable music levels, and eclectic patrons.

Overall, a solid 4-star dining experience. Food-option-wise they're in my Top 5 in the Valley (I've eaten at at least 100 restaurants here). If they can get the service kinks worked out, and kick up the alcohol content in their cocktails, they could easily be a 5-star place. Regardless, I will return...and it won't be a year again this time."}
{"text":"We had a reservation at 8pm on a Friday. We didn't get seated until almost 9pm. It was packed! We ordered a variety of steamed buns and dumplings to share for appetizers. We should have listened to our waiter that the catfish steamed bun was the best. I understand they were busy, but I feel like since we were a large group of 10 people they should have brought all of the appetizers out at once. I got the seafood hot pot. The rest of the group got the pork ramen or the duck curry. If you like spicy then this is the place for you! Loved the atmosphere and our server was super knowledgeable. He said the best thing on the menu is the duck curry. Although, I didn't try it. I would go back!just know that you are going to be there for a while especially on a weekend night."}
{"text":"My friend and I popped in here on Friday night around 9:30pm for a snack and some cocktails. It was my first time but my friend comes often and raved about it. I can see why!! Loved the ambience and the relaxed, modern decor. My friend had her service dog in training with her and the staff was awesome, very respectful and accommodating. We requested the patio and it was nice and cool outside with the misters. Very friendly service and awesome food! We each got a trio of the steamed buns. I had the soft shell crab, chicken and waffles, and pork belly for my selection. She opted for the crab for all three of hers. We also split an order of the calamari fries and ordered extra Yuzu aioli for dipping--amazing. They have a great selection of cocktails, beer, wine and sake. I had a Bellini and an IPA. I can't wait to go back to try more of this awesome menu."}
{"text":"Stylish hangout (not as cool as the original one in downtown phoenix) serve creative Mexi-Pan-Asian cuisine (not as together as the original one in downtown phoenix) flavor mix of Mexico, China, Japan & Korea, great craft cocktail on a menu that constantly changes. (not as cool as the original one in downtown phoenix - more of a main stream American white bread crowd here ) ... make sure the dishes are well paced and warm... (never an issue at the original one in downtown phoenix).
The crew make great efforts to make things good and right, so hats off for that, but I definitely will not think twice is I need to chose between this location of the OG in phoenix."}
{"text":"Poor customer service and the food on this day was not great.  We ordered a variety of different appetizers and also dinner, but food came out sloppy and not exactly how it was described on the menu.  The bartender that was serving us was actually the bar manager, but had poor customer service skills and lack of care if a customer returns.  It wasn't until I blatantly asked him \"are you having a bad day or something?\" that we actually got any attention..."}
{"text":"I like the energetic atmosphere. The drinks are good and reasonably priced. Some things I tried were down right CLEVER and other things I tried I was left underwhelmed with. 

The Caesar Salad is a delicate symphony of classic infused with the most delicate of Asian Flavors and even though I only had a small bite of it I thought it was delightful. I was expecting the Szechuan Crouton to be something special either spicy or full of flavor but it was just a hard lump of something I couldn't determine.

The Roast Corn Dumplings were another one of the very goods. The dumplings were tender and dressed with finely cut scallions. The Tomato Broth was multi-dimential with changing flavors of sofrito, ginger and Thai Basil with a building but not too hot heat.

I thought both appetizers were very good and will forget about the Szechuan Croutons.

I had the Salmon Bibimpap. I do note I am more sensitive than most people about smoke flavor and some smoke flavors are hard for me to tolerate. My first bite of the salmon was delicious with a charcoal kind of flavor that I enjoy but most of the salmon had a strong smoke flavor that took over. My vegetables were fresh and they gave me lots of brown rice. I didn't really taste any Korean Chili Glaze in my dish so I don't know if it had any or not. People who don't mind a smokey taste will like this dish.

My husband had the Kung Pao Fried Chicken. He was a little disappointed because the chicken was very soft and in his words \"squishy\" He was also disappointed because the spice and flavor level was \"Old White People from Sun City\".

I thought the Tea-a-misu was exactly the way it was described on the menu.

The Roasted Peach Fritters were really Donuts with a little bit of Peach in them. They were made fresh to order and were tasty with the Cream Cheese Dip.

Service was friendly but a little odd.

 My husband expressed his opinions to the management about the food. Our bill arrives and one dinner was removed. My husband pulled out his card to pay and tells the waitress it wasn't necessary to remove his dinner.

 So she comes back and ADDS the dinner back on.

That was odd wasn't it?

Good Drinks and Good Appetizers in an energetic atmosphere. I note you have to valet park behind the building to dine here."}
{"text":"Clever Koi is a great ramen bar and a welcome addition to the Central Ave restaurant scene. Both times that I've been here I've really enjoyed the atmostphere and the food.

The inside is sized perfectly - not too spacious, but not too small. They've got a good selection of booze behind the bar, and some unique cocktails to offer as well.

When it comes to food, I haven't been able to find any other place in town that serves Ramen as tasty as Clever Koi. This is where I get my fix! I also love their smoked pig face dumplings (don't be scared of the name) and their duck steamed buns are awesome.

Check this place out if you're in the mood for some delicious noodles - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Roman and Gavin are the best mixologists in the valley... Love their cocktails.. The best Ramen in the valley... Everything is awesome..."}
{"text":"The good: excellent food, great drink list, wonderful service, restaurant vibe, fantastic eye candy
The bad: noise level gets a little out of control, tight table arrangement, long weekend waits, small bathrooms

I've lived in Phoenix now for almost a year and this place still ranks in my top five restaurants in the valley. The drink list is pretty amazing, with unique cocktails and new takes on classic libations. The pork belly ramen was off the chain, so if it's on the menu, don't hesitate to get it! Their specials are pretty amazing as well. Upscale casual dress and diverse crowd. (FYI, I love that this place embraces diversity.)

I wouldn't go here for groups more than six. Tables are pretty tight as it is and you'd be waiting......for....ever.....to get a table. They're open for lunch, so if you're nearby, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Honestly? I'm not sure how you can improve upon perfection. Color me impressed!

We were in town visiting my parents, but we took a day and met up with a friend from college who has been living in Arizona for a while, and he suggested that we meet up here as he's been wanting to try it.

I can't speak for him, but I think he really enjoyed it. I know we did!

We arrived about 20 minutes before him and ordered a couple of drinks and the duck fat sriracha wings while we waited. Oh, the deliciousness and, not overly messy like some wings....When he arrived, we decided to just order a bunch of small plates and share. It was a little tight, considering that we sat at the bar, but we made it work. Between the three of us, we had the Tuna Chips, Red Miso Seared Kobe, Gojuchang Grilled Octopus, and each of the steamed buns. We ended with a banana bread pudding type thing for me and a date cake type of thing for our friend.

Everything was delicious! The wings had just the right amount of heat, as did the octopus. We were able to taste the flavors through the heat, which many restaurants, IMHO, overlook in favor of simply having a spicy dish on the menu, because it's trendy. The kobe beef was very tender. The tuna chips were a little bland for me, but then I prefer thinner cut tuna as in sushi, versus thick cuts as in poke. The steamed buns were amazing and you really can't go wrong with whichever you choose. The chicken and waffle one was definitely interesting. My banana dessert thing came with a small ramekin of caramel, which made it even better. It was like small banana bread pudding balls that you could dip in the caramel, or drizzle the caramel over the balls and fork 'em. I opted for dunking because.....caramel. LOTS OF CARAMEL. The date cake, while yummy, just wasn't my thing.

All in all, the flavors of each dish held their own yet melded nicely with one another. Even with the spicy dishes, the heat didn't overpower the food. My husband had beers, my friend drank wine and I had delicious hand crafted cocktails. The service was very prompt, our server/bar tender was extremely helpful in explaining and recommending items on the menu, and was just downright friendly. Although this place is more of what I consider an upscale restaurant, the service (at least at the bar) was as if we were old friends who had stopped in after a long absence.

I would definitely recommend the Clever Koi and I will definitely be back.

{"text":"We came here last year and enjoyed it so much that my love and I drove about 30min from Fountain Hills to have lunch...and I can't wait to come back already.

There have been some slight changes in the menu since our last visit, such as not having \"build-your-own-Ramen\"... but they now have daily happy hour from 11am to 6pm, virtually lunch and early dinner. 

Early November and 78 degrees outside, with a light breeze and plenty of sun, we were eagerly seated outside, on the patio, under the shade. We first ordered cocktails...Thai Basil Gimlet and Paloma. Very delicious and balanced in flavor.  On to lunch...we started with 3 steamed buns, 2 Soft Shell Crab and 1 Tempura Catfish, all three for $12.50.  You can mix and match from the Steamed Buns selection or order one for $4.50 each.  Our waiter suggested Green Sriracha for the seafood items, and it was a perfect spicy pairing for the buns. Next we had Green Curry Hummus to share.  It is large enough to share with 3-4 people, and certainly enjoyable. For the entree we shared the Zesty Noodles.  They use Yakisoba Noodles, with shrimp and crab dressed in Bulgogi sauce, Housemade green Sriracha, and peanuts. Every single bite was well balanced with Asian flavor and spicy.  

Their appetizers change seasonally. Service was attentive and friendly...answering all our questions about dishes and menu changes.

If we didn't have plans for dinner, I wouldn't mind coming back for more dishes later in the day...to be honest I may stay in Arizona for a week just to eat out here.

{"text":"Every time I've come here it has been awesom i live right up the street so its nice to be able to walk up and have a drink and some food! The staff definitely makes the experience! Just from the start the hostess Savanah was a breath of fresh air even in the middle of a friday night dinner rush she got us water while we waited and everything i know how hard it is to keep a smile on your face during busy time! The servers are on top of shit too i love efficiency with a smile kick ass guys!!!!!! We love you Clever Koi!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Employee recommended pig face dumpling and massaman udon and it was a great meal to split for two! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Visited this location last night for dinner with the family. Let's start with the location.. location is great surrounded by other business, there's not many parking spaces but that's okay because there's a huge parking structure you can park at or even the dirt lot across the street, not a far walk. 

The ambience is so chill and a great vibe for a cool Friday night. I loved the candles lit on the table, the lighting inside was great. 

We had reservations at 8pm for a table of 5, and literally as soon as we walked in we were seated (which was awesome). Waitress came straight over with waters for us all. My mom and I ordered the Lemongrass Swizzle ($11 each, not too bad for a tall cocktail). We ordered 2 orders of the steamed buns with pork belly (3/12.50) which were amazing! I loved the crunchiness of the pork belly. For my main meal I had the pork ramen (15.00) the pork ramen was okay quite honestly. The flavor of the broth tasted really bland to me. The pork belly and pulled pork really complimented the meal. 

Overall, it was a great place. The waitress was sooo nice and very attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"We decided to try the Clever Koi based on all the positives reviews on Yelp and wow!!!   What an amazing experience!  We've eaten at places all over the world from 5 Star restaurants to little tiny dive hole in the walls...and we just have to say...\"this place has nailed it on all accounts\" Super great staff, hostess, training, vibe, setting, service and FOOD!   What a great TEAM effort everyone made to make sure we had a wonderful time.  The food was incredible, creative, delicious and affordable.   Can't remember everything we ate and enjoyed, but we will be back soon for round two!  Thanks so much and keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Are there more than 5 stars?. Absolutely amazing place. 
The dumplings, the ramen, the fried rice and the service were all excellent. 
If only we lived closer we would be there all the time. Though we are not afraid to drive food good food. 
Oh, you can buy their house made sauces! Happy dances at this house!,,"}
{"text":"I am so happy that The Clever Koi is open. It gives me hope that smart inventive people will start colonizing Central Phoenix.  The Clever Koi has a laid back, unpretentious vibe.  It's a great place to hang out after work.  Overall I had an excellent experience.  First they have a great selection of wines that you don't typically see other places.  I'm not sure if they are connected to the wine bar next door, but I appreciate that there was something different to choose from.

We ordered a selection of dishes.  The low point was the Wood Fired Grill Plate which was just so/so.  Everything else was delicious, particularly the corn dogs. 

We live a block away so I am sure that we will become regulars."}
{"text":"A fusion restaurant that doesn't stick its nose high in the air or fall flat on its face in execution. Walking in, the atmosphere was one that was casual, elegant, and modern. Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and passionate about the food. I ordered quite a bit, but luckily they have a good amount of small items.  

The octopus tostadas was quite delightful in executing a Mexican dish with subtle Japanese flavors. The tostadas was crunchy, veggies were fresh, the wasabi was just in the background, and the octopus was charred just right. The octopus is an unforgiving piece of meat, but they made it tender while maintaining just a small amount of chew.  

The pig face dumpling was quite a delight. The meat wasn't smoked, but it tasted like it. The cheek meat was braised to where it was moist, tender, and not stringy. The dumpling shell itself was soft with some firmness. The kimchi was quite spicy! Don't eat it straight on, or you will fall out of your seat from the spicy punch. The kimchi and dumpling in one bite is definitely the way to eat it.  

The soft shell crab bao bun was delicious! The crabmeat was super fresh, and the juices in the crab packed a mighty seafood flavor. The creamy fixings on top were a nice touch that didn't distract. The bao bun itself was soft, doughy, yet firm like it should be.  

The chicken and waffle bao bun with the ponzu sauce was way better than I expected. That ponzu sauce basically tasted like a lemony maple syrup without the sugar. Although I wish the waffle was crispier, that's just my personal preference. The waffle itself may be hard to bend if they did crisp it up.  

The duck curry was a truckload of flavor. The curry itself is what truly made the meal. What was even better were the bits of whole peanuts!  The duck felt a tad overcooked, it never lost its gamy flavor. My suggestion would be sharing this meal with another person. My half portion was just enough to start upsetting my stomach from the heat that dish contains. I guarantee you won't have fun during your next run to the bathroom, but the flavors are so worth it.  

The banana fritters were not as amazing as I was expecting. It's definitely more European sweet, which I'm ok with. My problem was the banana flavor wasn't that pronounced, The cinnamon sugar they add on the top, as well as the fried breading stood out the most. Even the caramel sauce they provide didn't add much to the flavor profile as I wanted They are also huge gut busters of fullness. With each bite, I felt like a bowling ball had landed in my stomach. They aren't greasy or queasy, but they are definitely filling. Don't run a mile after eating these! 

Its exciting to see a Japanese fusion restaurant that doesn't rely on sushi or izakaya style items. They take Japanese ingredients and run the opposite direction of what you would expect. Even if everything doesn't hit the mark, its still a great experience."}
{"text":"I've been here enough to know I love it.  Picture a place opened by hipsters that love Asian food and reaaaalllllly know how to cook and blend flavors.  

The tables and setting are nice and not overdone.  But still quality and comfortable. The music is good and just loud enough so you can have a private conversation at your table without anyone else overhearing it even though the tables are close.  

The food is outstanding and the menu is unique.  I really enjoy the soft boiled egg on just about every meal. 

Lunch is a smaller menu but quick and wonderful.   Dinner is even better.  The quality of the ingredients and the final product are really that good!

Service is very attentive and follows the anyone can help you mantra.  

Come for lunch or dinner, but get here before you cannot get in without a wait."}
{"text":"This is a very cool little restaurant. The food is delicious and not expensive at all. I tried the tuna chips and they were so yummy. I also had the soft shell crab bun, pork belly bun and the chicken and waffle taco. I loved the pork belly and the soft shell buns. I wasn't a fan of the chicken and waffle one by the time I ate it it was soggy. My husband had the pad Thai with steak and he loved it. The staff was friendly. I would definitely recommend this place and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Right off the bat I can tell you the service is excellent. Consistently. From when seated at the bar or the table or outside they crush it in the service department all day err day ! Its nestled away next to the wine bar and salon and is intimate and warm inside. The outdoor seating is ok as long as it isnt a 100 .. Phoenix, right ? :) 

The cocktails are delish, and i cannot thank the bartenders enough. They make beautiful cocktails crafted for you after they take the time to talk to you and know you and  honestly it is refreshing they do. I mean it wasn't a slow nigh by any means when i have been here but they are always engaging and friendly. Cannot appreciate it enough 

The food was great, plenty of vegetarian options and I have never left the place anything less than completely satiated. From ramen to black rice and to random drinks clever koi is always a hit."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my wife.

This place is not very big and reservations would be a good idea for dinner.
We had lunch, which involves a multiple choice menu. I had the udon noodles with pork belly and pork broth, the wife had shrimp and dashi on udon.

The pork was fried but maybe a bit too much as it was getting stuck to my teeth, it was good otherwise, I would probably not have broth the next time or maybe ask for less of it, as it is difficult to eat that much food and then try to eat all the broth. The udon noodles were very well made and just the right amount of chewy.

I had their pork steamed buns which is served more like a taco, it was very good especially with their in house made sriracha. 

My wife enjoyed her food but also could not finish the broth.

A lot of millennial's work here some of them can't put their phones away.

The music could have been turned down a little bit. I don't go to restaurants for music I go for food."}
{"text":"I was expecting it to be good.. but this was the most surprisingly great new spot I have tried in a long time. The drinks were amazing, we got the bowl for 2, the appetizers were all incredible. We had a group of 10 and tried almost all of them and they were all better than the next! The entree was stellar and service to match, not to mention the price was very affordable. Top new spot, definitely will be back often!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food!! Every dish was so delicious and beautifully presented. I recommend sharing dishes so you can get all the flavors. We shared a soft shell crab steamed bun, pig face dumplings, short rib dumplings, kimchi fried rice (I don't even like kimchi but this was fantastic), pad thai (sweet & spicy) and zesty noodles. We would have ordered more if we could eat more. The staff was very nice and knowledgeable. Fun atmosphere with large bar and open kitchen. Worth every dollar. Will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Recently found this terrific restaurant in new trendy central Phoenix. The service is terrific, the kitchen is a little slow, but only because they are perfectionists. The the drink
Menu is contemporary and innovative. Favorite drink is the Up in Smoke. Don't drop it on your next menu change pppllleeeaaassseee!!!"}
{"text":"Okay so may I just say that it is hard to find weekend HH that are worth going to...

Now, I must say that on an afternoon just wandering around with not much planned or to do I just so happened to stumble onto this place. It is trendy, casual, and well decorated. The drink prices are definitely affordable and the best part is the $5 menu.

Where else can you get such a tasty little snack/lunch on a Sat afternoon? And it was not super packed so it made the exp that much nicer that I could actually hear the person talking across from me. We ordered the roasted asian beet salad and the chicken wings.

The salad was OMG amazing. For that price?? You must be kidding. Golden beets, tempura bean curd, fresh mizuna (no one has this btw), cucumber, and a lemongrass vin... so delicious for 5 bucks

And the wings, great flavor! The chili sauce was fantastic... however, i do happen to be a VERY picky wing eater. i am one of the harshest critics on wings... they were a little underdone and kinda soggy. So... note to the chef

All in all though I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, delicious cocktails, knowledgeable and friendly staff. What more can you ask for? Oh, and their happy hour is outstanding as well. Stopped in yesterday during happy hour and had two appetizers: spicy tuna chips and hummus. Each one was incredible, both in presentation and taste. In addition to the food, my wife and I each had one of their specially cocktails, so flavorful and not light on the alcohol. We will definitely return and be sure to pass along our recommendation to friends. This place hasn't been open a year; I have a feeling it's going to be around a long time. Keep up your fine work"}
{"text":"I am a very particular person when it comes to where I go out to eat but we were out and didn't know the area and Clever koi was right there. I never heard of it but we gave it a try. I am so impressed with the service we got and the atmosphere. The food was absolutely delicious. I got Sriracha wings, my friend got street corn, and then we got the grilled nectarine and I think it was caramel fritters for dessert. Everything tasted amazing. I'm seriously so impressed with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome vibes as you walk in the door.  Inside and outside, large bar top.  Bartender made amazing cocktails, and even did a \"dealer's choice\" cocktail for my friend that was made with mescal and very delicious.  Everything I've eaten here has been excellent and full of flavor.  I had the build your own bowl to accompany my drink and it was filling.  My only complaints are the bartender had his sanitary towel around his neck the whole time, weird, and it's a bit on the expensive side but definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food. Many items made in house that you would never think of. Great selection of small entrees and their menu changes seasonally. Get the tuna chips and veal potstickers. Also the oyster beer is great."}
{"text":"I was super excited to hit town and try this place, since the menu looked inspiring. I am deeply disappointed. I ordered my dishes for delivery. They came all nicely packaged and I went to open them in my hotel room. I had several things wrong on my order. I ended up with a dish I didn't order instead of my potstickers and no utensils, which I paid extra for. I figured out I got the chicken ramen dish and galbi ribs. The ramen was completely soggy, because they didn't separate the noodles and broth, like most ramen places do who take to go orders. The noodles fell apart in a tasteless broth. The meat on the top was dry and hacked to the point I could barely tell it was chicken. I took two bites and couldn't stomach eating anymore. I moved onto the ribs and discovered they were mostly burnt and dried out. If this is what the restaurant has to offer, I would pass on any further meals. As someone who has had ramen in Japan, I recommend trying a different place for ramen."}
{"text":"This is the best local spot for the most amazing Mondern Asian in all of Pheonix! The food is unbelievable, the service is excellent, the ambience is reflection of the unparalleled originality that is clever koi. This is an absolute most go if your in Pheonix or anywhere in AZ it's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I love the Clever Koi. 

We normally get the lemongrass chicken ramen, which is my favorite, and my boyfriend loves the salt and pepper soft shell crab. Normally we pair those with some small dish items (sticky buns, dumplings etc.). 

The make incredible cocktails that take some time to make, but are worth the wait. The staff is really good at recommending drinks based on your likes. 

Everything we have ever had is delicious. Most the time we would get irritated at the price per portion for some of the items, but the flavor makes up for it. They also have some awesome weekly specials - two entrees and drinks for $45+. Was worth it for us."}
{"text":"I had some of the best chow mein I've ever tasted at this place.   My girlfriend had the pork ramen, another outstanding dish.  Cool ambience with a diverse crowd (office workers, hipsters, etc).  Awesome service by everyone from the moment we walked in the door.   Try the \"riding the pine\" cocktail!"}
{"text":"While the service was excellent, and our server was very accommodating and extremely friendly, our signature cocktails and food were less than pleasing. I ordered the seafood hotpot. Not thrilled. My friend ordered short rib me fly over rice... Also not impressed. Great downtown ambiance, but I was expecting more with the food in terms of portion size and taste for the price."}
{"text":"4 1/2 really!  Loved it.  Tried the avocado app with crab, lettuce cups, chicken waffle bun, pork belly bun, chicken ramen, pad Thai, hot pot and more.  They have upside down pineapple cake and banana balls.  Freakin unbelievable.  The service was solid and they have home made Siracha, which I bought a bottle of.  It would make shoe leather taste awesome.  Cocktails- of course we did!  We tried several including The Enabler and Fish Out of Water.  Really creative.  Would go back in a second.  Downtown Gilbert is finally getting some variety."}
{"text":"Meeting some friends here for NYE dinner! We ordered Deep Fried Turkey Legs and it was pretty good as the meat was tender and juicy. Our next appetizer was Peking Duck Bun, I would say this was my favorite dish with everything we ordered. The bun was soft which it should be, the sauce that came with dipped with the bun and the meat brought out the flavor and was so tasteful. The next three dishes we ordered were Kimchi Fried Rice, some Ramen Soup, and Chicken Katsu (spelling??) they were all too blend. I usually eat pretty blend but these have no flavor. For Kimchi Fried Rice I didn't taste any Kimchi flavor. The soup for the Ramen was just soy sauce and water no soup base. Maybe I am an Asian and might have a little more high expectation on Asian food."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I came in for lunch for the first time yesterday to find a great deal on the build-your -own bowls. I had chow mein with shrimp, broccoli, and mushrooms- very good. Servers are always there when you need them. The only negative I'd mention is a piece of a cold udon noodle on top of my chow mein, lol. You can see it in my picture...Servers should pay attention to detail when they're running food out to tables..."}
{"text":"On Friday 6/3 my husband and I went to the Clever Koi and sat at the chef's bar. It was our first time there and Sydnie our server made great recommendations for our entire experience: Drinks, (I don't like sweet cocktails) she made a good recommendation of Pimms Cup with a slight modification. Dinner: Pig Face (wonderfully amazing spicy and savory), Belly Buns, and Lemon Chicken with egg. She also suggested dessert Fritters with ice cream. Nice finish! We had a super time there and Sydnie was great. Thanks so much."}
{"text":"Amazing first experience at Clever Koi.  I ended up ordering a brandy and blackberry cocktail named the Little Sheba...pretty delicious. I had the roasted corn dumplings to start and then dug into the shrimp and steak chow mein. I was stuffed but felt a review would not be complete without an amazing dessert. So I went for the bananas foster fritters.  Let's just say they didn't disappoint and I'll be starting my new diet in the morning.  As a matter of fact I may come back just for those fritters. 

All in all a great new spot for me.  A little far from home but I am starting to venture out and check out new places. I highly recommend this spot and ask for David at the bar.  Great recommendations."}
{"text":"Delicious food. The ramen is amazing, and the pork bun appetizer is so delicious. The food is a little too pricey for my liking, but if you're looking for something special, it''s worth it. Nice atmosphere, and the staff tends to be very attentive."}
{"text":"I've been to Clever Koi a couple of times, the first time was for happy hour, which was a great value. They have expertly crafted drinks that are an experience to enjoy. I had the bee keeper, which is a gin martini with lavender honey and citrus. This past weekend I tried their short rib at Devoured (amazing) and decided to come back for lunch today. I had the Temperance Trap, a tall gin drink with amaro, citrus, and bitters. Very refreshing and delicious. My boyfriend had a piney passion fruit drink we both also really enjoyed. We had the pig faced dumplings as an appetizer. They are served on a bed of kimchi and were the perfect beginning to our meal. We both built our own ramen bowls. I had pork belly with pork broth, bok choy and egg. It was so flavorful and the pork belly was the perfect mix of crisp on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. Our service has been great both times, and the atmosphere is nice but comfortable."}
{"text":"A great space and I want to come back for dinner. Lunch was good, but not great. It was a brown rice bowl with 4 grilled shrimp and a little broccoli. It took 20 minutes. I had the feeling the guys in the open kitchen  thought this was art and I saw brown rice in a bowl with shrimp."}
{"text":"Loved every dish I tried! Lemon pepper chicken is my new favorite addiction. Dumplings on point. Chicken and waffle sticky bun was spicy and full of awesome flavor. I will be back."}
{"text":"Wow  this place is hip and awesome. Food is delish and service is top notch.  The patio area is open with several seating along with heaters on those cold AZ evenings. Had the pork belly steamed buns along with the short ribs. The flavor was so good. The scorpion drink is off the chain."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about the Clever Koi.  My girlfriend and I ordered the following for dinner:

To start:
Black bean and celery root pancakes
Corn dumplings

Mains:
Kimchi fried rice w chicken
Vegetarian chow mein

I'll give Clever Koi props on their starters which were both fantastic.  Their house made sauces add an extra dimension to these dishes.  I love spicy so dipped my bites in their green sriracha.

Where the meal went sideways is with the kimchi fried rice.  Specifically, the kimchi.  

It tasted exceedingly of vinegar and undermined the whole dish.  Alone, the fried rice and chicken are pretty good.

Having lived in South Korea, I know what authentic (and quality) kimchi tastes like.  The kimchi at the Clever Koi does not taste like it has been properly fermented.  Rather, I imagine the ingredients were thrown together without respect for the process and true nature of the dish.  This is my best guess as to the source of such an overwhelming taste of vinegar that clashed with the other flavors.  Please note that I absolutely love kimchi and am not opposed to their concept.

My girlfriends vegetarian chow mein was fresh and executed well.  I am deducting two stars because whether the Clever Koi intentionally prepares their kimchi this way or if it was an off night - it tanked the meal for me.

I am open to giving the Clever Koi another chance, but would need to be thoroughly impressed to become a repeat customer."}
{"text":"If I could take anything with me for the rest of my life, and always have it in my purse, in my fridge, in my food, it's the Panang brown butter. You're doing yourself a disservice by not ordering the whole deep fried soft shell crab.

This place incredible and doesn't even need my review. We had the Softshell Crab, Short Rib Dumplings, Kimchi Fried Rice with duck, and Pork Belly Ramen. All exceeded our expectations. Cutting into the crab and having it just ooze bright white, juicy meat was so satisfying. It had the beautiful taste of the sea that told you how fresh it was. 


Everything was great. We were lucky enough to sit at the bar looking into the kitchen, our own personal chef's table. The cook working the fry station was super nice and engaged with us. My favorite restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"It's like a hipster's attempt at Asian cuisine. We were not impressed. I think I could've made a better  dish at home with Maruchan and some Siracha. Don't believe the hype. The service was good! Server and the appetizer saves 1 Star for this place."}
{"text":"Yet another restaurant that makes you valet your car.  We parked in the large, mostly empty parking lot ajacent to the restaurant.  As we approached the front door, the valet guy tells us we will be towed if we leave our car there.  Ok, back to the car, to find a restaurant with parking.  As we were leaving, I did see some street parking but by then I was not in the mood for The Clever Koi.  Sorry, lost a customer, won't be back."}
{"text":"Even though we did not make reservation, the hostess was able to seat us right away. However our server was so busy, we had to flag her twice before she could come to our table to take our orders. 

Our appetizers were the soft shell crab in steamed bun and the fried chicken with waffle. They were served with a side of soy sauce vinaigrette. I found their flavor profiles interesting, but only fair to my taste. My wife, however, liked both, especially the soft shell crab. 

The pineapple fried duck leg, roasted vegetables & rice cake. The duck had crispy skin & nice flavor, but the meat was dry. The pineapple sauce was so light that I could not taste its fruitiness (my wife did though). 

The lemon chicken ramen that my wife ordered had a nice, yet light, broth. The chicken pieces were crispy & tasty. The noodles were al dente. But the pickled daikon did not go well with the rest of soup, in my opinion. Again, my wife liked this bowl of ramen. 

Perhaps my taste buds were off tonight. I found the cuisine here fair, but not outstanding. My wife liked this restaurant though. 

The banana fritters, served with a caramel sauce on the side, were good. And so was the vanilla ice cream. 

Our server was attentive. She refilled our glasses several times during our time there. She did not mind repeating the dessert menu at our request. 

Because this restaurant is at least 26 miles away from our home and my neutral experience with its dishes, I am uncertain I will make the effort to return to it."}
{"text":"Despite what its name implies, at least what I thought I'd be getting, The Clever Koi in downtown Phoenix does not serve sushi. It does, however, serve really tasty Asian noodle and rice dishes, and I was pleasantly surprised to love my meal even though I usually am only a Thai and sushi fan when it comes to Asian eats.

The hip spot has a patio overlooking Central Avenue, with the \"dings\" of the light rail creating the soundtrack to your dining experience if you choose to sit outside - which I love doing. Inside, an open kitchen and bar complements a bustling atmosphere with tables in cozy confines that make neighboring diners your friends.

My pal and I took advantage of the $30 special, which came with a jug of spiked punch, a fruity concoction made with Japanese rice wine, pineapple juice and other fruit flavors. I could tell by my buzz it was strong, but you wouldn't be able to tell by the sweet flavor of the drink, which was refreshing and delicious.

It was the perfect way to cool off the palate during my meal of vegetable chow mein, which was very filling with a ton of noodles and veggies. I loved the house-made sriracha sauce and also added soy sauce. I cleaned up my bowl, no problem. My only disappointment was I wasn't able to take advantage of the gluten-free noodles in my dish - our server said with the veggie chow mein, that wasn't an option.

My pal got tofu fried rice, which he also enjoyed and ended up taking half of it home - his portion was also very generous, so I guess I was just hungrier. Our server said the tofu is marinated, which makes it extra flavorful, and my pal agreed.

The staff was really friendly, but it was a bummer it took about 10 minutes to get hot sauce and soy sauce after our food was delivered. Other than that, the happening spot had an energizing atmosphere and made me like Asian food more than I ever thought I would."}
{"text":"This place is horrible, if you ever had real Ramen you will undrestand what a disaster is this place, terrible terrible food"}
{"text":"Clever koi has been on my list of restaurants to try since moving to phoenix. The atmosphere was great and the service was phenomenal. I had the Mongolian beef for dinner and I would say it was just okay. I think it would have been awesome but the beef almost tasted like it had been deep fried. Other than that though the sauce and portion were spot on. I will definitely be back to try something different. It could have just been me."}
{"text":"Clever Koi is nestled in a charming little nook along Central and right next door to a wine bar and a hair salon. 

Atmosphere: 

This is a perfect date night spot or night out with friends. It's intimate and charming inside with low lighting and a warmth coming from the kitchen. You can either choose to sit inside or outside and if you sit inside, you can watch them hustle and bustle behind the counter. 

Food/Drink 

I didn't have a cocktail there the night I went, but I was impressed with the extension cocktail list and will definitely be back to give it a try. The food theme here is a lot about sharing which is what we did. 

We started with a couple appetizers, and the one that stood out the most were the Edamame Fritters which were delicious! Imagine Edamame fried into a ball with a sweet sauce to dip. For our main meal, we decided to try several different dishes including the Massaman Curry, Chow Mein, Fried Rice and a couple other items. My favorite item by far was the Curry and when I come back, I will just order that and possibly ask for extra chicken. It had the perfect flavor to it and was creamy and delicious! 

I really like this restaurant and especially the atmosphere and warmth. It's a nice addition to the growing Downtown area and I hope they put more businesses like this in the area."}
{"text":"exceptionally amazing and unique food. their calamari is a small portion, but they were amazing as well. make a reservation if you don't want to wait in line for more than two people eating dinner. especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"OMG! My girl found this spot for a \"romantic\" place that stayed open late on a Friday night! 
Great option! I haven't seen a bar this extensive with fresh ingredients since I left Atlanta 6 years ago. 
EVERYTHING is custom and fresh! Even the fresh eucalyptus on the tables and fresh flowers in the bathroom. My cocktail had fresh thyme! Win Win!
Let Me not get started on the food! 
We had about 6 different dishes all they were all good.
The kimchi fried rice with duck was like an orgasm in My mouth!
I just found our new date spot! 
Thanks Clever Koi"}
{"text":"Their food and drinks have me coming back! One of my favorite spots for a drink and dinner. The bee's knees is always consistent as well as the kimchi fried rice and the chow menu. Definitely a place to check out and a place that makes you want to come back for more. I would recommend for a date night or a causal dinner. The severs are also amazing and they take great care of you and have amazing attention to detail."}
{"text":"Tonight was disappointing with food and service. This was the first time the food and service were not up to par.  The waitress did not know the drink menu and served the wrong drink. The waitress never checked if we needed more water, when my food option was too salty she never apologized or tried to be accommodating. It didn't seem to matter to her if we had a good experience or not. Overall a big bummer experience."}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is awesome, service is great - every person really friendly and helpful. My favorite dishes  are the chop chop salad and pork fried rice. The bartenders will make you a special cocktail if you give them a basic flavor profile, which is a great way to try a new drink or two."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to hit up Clever Koi on a random weekday night in an attempt to actually explore our surroundings. We had a bit of trouble finding it since it is tucked away from the road, but we finally found the right parking area after we looped around once. We had made reservations since we were worried about a possible crowd and a table was ready for us when we got in. We were seated quickly and definitely had a moment of \"oh god what should I order because everything sounds good.\" The menu had gyoza, buns, noodles, ramen, etc.  My friend was super interested in the rabbit gyoza while I was drawn to the black bean and celery root cakes. My friend enjoyed the gyoza and we both liked the black bean and celery root cakes but agreed that they would have been better with either less wasabi, or perhaps wasabi on the side rather than directly on top. For our main dishes, we grabbed the pork ramen and the pad thai with tofu. My friend loved the pork ramen and I thought the pad thai was good, though a bit on the sweeter side than I like. I also felt that $3.00 was a bit of an excessive charge for adding tofu to the pad thai, particularly because it literally came with 3 large pieces of tofu only. Though I was a bit irked by the tofu portion, the pad thai portion was ginormous. I could not finish it in one sitting and definitely had to take some to go. One thing I really loved about this place was that they had their own little hot sauces that you can use to spice up your food. I'm a spicy/flavorful food junkie so this was right up my sleeve. 

Clever Koi lived up to my expectations overall. It had great service, good food, a very chill atmosphere, and an interesting interior + patio seating. I am definitely going back to try their other menu items such as chow mein and vegetarian ramen! *I may also be super curious about their interesting list of cocktails.*"}
{"text":"Wow this is the best chicken broth I've ever had ! Seriously I don't know how they do it
It's magical.  I took my little 92 year old grandpa and all he could say was wow this is delicious so fresh & beautiful.  

The lunch bowl was pretty large we couldn't finish it, they will charge you for extra broth but it's worth every dime.  

The broccoli was fresh and defiantly al dente 
I can't stand when veggies are limp and loose color that indicates to me that they at are over cooked. 

The bathroom was clean and Nicely decorated.  

We tried the banana fritters which were very tasty ! Crunchy on the outside rolled in a light sugar nice warm and fluffy on the inside filled with fragrant banana

Five little balls come in a serving

I live kind of far from there but I will most certainly be back"}
{"text":"Love their steamed buns, tried all the buns on the menu. Catfish and soft shell crab buns are our favorite. Short rib is also good, tender and flavorful! Ramen is good, but not the best. I wouldn't order the Ramen, because I have really high expectations about Ramen, both the noodles and the broth have to be really good for me. Hachi Ramen in San Diego is the best so far. 
Seafood hotpot is a must order every time we go. They put a lot of squid, scallops and shrimp in the hotpot with udon noodles. This place is an Asian influenced restaurant. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went a few months back and am really wanting to get back there. The dishes are unique and new and everything was delicious. 

I ordered a special.  It was a seafood broth that was loaded with charred octopus, potatoes, mussels and veggies. It was amazing. 

The katsu is great! Such a simple and overdone Asian dish that becomes new again with the freshest ingredients and house made sauces. 

Great beer selection too. I didn't get to try a cocktail but I will next time. 

Also, the banh mi and ramen are next on my list. I can't wait. 

Pricing was on point, portions are definitely reasonable and atmosphere is an A+"}
{"text":"I heard this place was legit so we were thrilled I got us in at the last minute. Staff was cool and accommodating, made us special (insanely complex and delish) drinks and had amazing recommendations. The vibe was laid-back and eclectic. The food was diverse and delicious. The staff really knew the menu and seemingly appreciated the fare as much as we all did. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves food and a rad vibe."}
{"text":"Outstanding potholes soft bread tacos. Loved the food and great beer selection. Super friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"I finally got the chance to check out this place a couple days ago and I wasn't very impressed.  When we got to the place, we were greeted by a friendly gentleman and my first impression was great, it was a nice start to our dinner.  We sat at the bar and were then greeted with menus and waters by one of the bartenders.  We ordered off the happy hour menu and the drinks were perfect, but the pork ramen was mediocre.  It was pretty bland, which was a major let down.  The female bartender wasn't very pleasant and had a constant angry look on her face.  This wouldn't be our first option for dinner, but we may be willing to check it out some other time and order different items."}
{"text":"I am giving five stars. One item fell short and I will explain later. The service was excellent. The tuna chips, like ahi nachos on fluffy rice chips, were amazing. The server highly  recommended them without being too pushy or overselling. They were awesome, and I am going back to have them again. The pork belly steamed bun was amazing! Perfectly cooked, a bit of crispiness yet moist and lovely. The hoisin sauce was good too. The soft shell crab steamed bun was really delicious on first bite, but I lost interest after that. It was really good though and I do recommend it. 
The Korean Fried Chicken ... I give a disclaimer that I go to Ktown in NYC and LA and eat KFC there, it's one of my favorite foods. So, if you are gonna call something Korean Fried Chicken, you better bring it. They don't. It's good, for fried chicken, but it's no KFC (Korean Fried Chicken). 
Also, I will have the bean pancake next time I return. I hear it's great. 
They need to have soju on the drink menu. It's the #1 selling liquor in the world and you have KFC and korean pancake on the menu. You must sell soju too."}
{"text":"I don't think I can even begin to say enough about this place. Literally everything I have tried on both the food and drink menus has exceeded expectations. The menu is pretty unique but is definitely accessible to just about anyone. This is my new favorite restaurant and frankly should get a whole second review just for the brilliant craft cocktails. Do not miss out on this place."}
{"text":"We ate outside. They have high fans outside that are quiet but keeps nice breezes coming along. It was very nice. Inside looked great, too. Very streamlined with tasteful decorations. 

It was hard to pick what to eat. A lot of yelpers posted great pictures but they change the menu every few months so a lot of the pictures weren't being served. However they have a small menu so it's focused and makes your choice easier. 

We had the duck curry. It was pretty spicy but it's a nice thickened curry with big udon noodles. As I figured with most dishes here, it didn't have a lot of meat. You can probably see that in various dishes in the photos posted. The roasted potatoes in there were great. 

We had the tea-a-misu which I didn't care for. The texture was off. I wanted to try the steamed bun sandwiches but I couldn't justify the price for just one. 

They have an eclectic drink menu that is certainly fun to try. Happy Hour covers some drinks and some appetizers and it's 3-6pm everyday. 

What upped this rating was the service. We were treated by probably three different people but they were all friendly and not just with the standard recited lines too. We had questions and they were all informative and all of them checked up on us at some point to make sure we were doing okay."}
{"text":"My husband found this place one day while looking for somewhere to have lunch and boy were we lucky. The atmosphere is so kick back but classy and sophisticated at the same time. The patio is a great place to have your meal if the weather permits. I suggest starting your meal with the tuna chips  It is so fresh and delighful. What really makes this place stand out to me is the staff. Our waiter is the BEST! I was told his name is Andy. Really nice guy. He ALWAYS recommends the best food. However, anything you get will be the best!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in greater PHX area. Bit of a drive from Scottsdale but I may as well get used to it because it's gonna be a regular of ours. Cool building as you approach with a super cool patio, inside is super chill and well decorated with neat light fixtures, clean bathrooms which is a must. On to the food. Andrew was very helpful in our decisions being that everything sounded great. Pad Thai, best ever, house salad best ever, Brussel sprouts best ever, fried black rice with shrimp was awesome! Start with the Tuna rice chips. WOW! No room for deserts, can't wait to go and try the mixologist cocktails. Can't wait to back period. Pictured is Kimchi fried rice we got to go knowing that we'd be craving to try one more thing next day. Can't say enough good things about this place. Goooo!!!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but was a little disappointed. The appetizer of red curry mussels was excellent. Great start to the night. Hubby was happy with his green tea. I got a Paloma which was okay. We ended up having to wait at least 40 minutes after our appetizer to get our dinner... They were busy but didn't think it should've been that bad of a wait. The food was greasy at best. It was very oily which made it slimy. The chow mein has good flavor. The pad Thai lacks major flavor. Our waitress was nice and gave us a discount for the delay in our food. Appreciated that she at least noticed that. Unfortunately left a little disappointed. Would have given 2.5 stars if half stars were an option."}
{"text":"Wish I could give them an extra star. Nick, Owner, went ABOVE AND BEYOND to make our first experience a home run.

Fabulous food, great drink menu and exotic dinner specials. Best restaurant in Phoenix in my opinion.

Thanks Nick, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner for the first time tonight. Very nice ambiance, comfortable yet upscale. We had the pork belly bun, miso seared Kobe beef and the pineapple duck rice. All were excellent and a great, different combo of flavors. Our server Pedro was very nice and friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I like it, the food is unique and different. I loved the park belly steamed bun and the.pork Ramen is awesome.  I came in at 4pm and it was getting busy.  But the place was worth it. Only 4 stars and not five because I thought the food could have come out a bit faster but it wasn't such a big impact."}
{"text":"I love the Vegetable Ramen here!  That is all I order.  Even I ordered without any salt (due to my self-imposed diet restriction), the bowl of soup is still perfect and full of rich umami taste!  If I want to go crazy & ignore my diet restriction, the Crispy Pineapple Duck is what I dream about."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from my friend I was excited to come eat here. The restaurant is open and laid back. It's kinda small but they offer seating outside so it's not to bad. The bar area is very nice and open and I like that you can see the chefs cooking. We started off with the steamed buns. I ordered the Peking duck and my boyfriend got the Tempura onion ring. The Peking duck had house bacon with mizuna and charred plum jam. It was tasty and I think the steam buns complimented the duck but it was a little messy to eat. The tempura onion ring was ok. Just tasted like onion rings wrapped in a bun with pineapple flavoring. Then we got a Seafood Hot Pot and Massaman Udon. The bowls were a bit on the small side.. I could have paid $6 less and got a big bowl of pho. But anyways the Seafood Hot pot was good but not great. I liked the shrimp and scallop and the octopus fish cake. The only thing I would have liked was more broth . They filled the soup broth only 1/3 of the bowl. My boyfriends dish the Massaman Udons were delicious!! It had red curry with roasted duck, fingerling and pickled peppers. It tasted just like a Thai dish but instead of rice they served it with noodles. I wanted to eat his food instead of mine lol.

Overall I would come back for the steamed buns. The staff was friendly but the service was slow. It wasn't that busy but it took forever to get our food and check."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with some co workers and was very impressed! I had a fried rice bowl with brown fried rice, tofu, broccoli, egg, and kimchi. Sooo delicious. Price wasn't cheap but wasn't terrible--base price is $5 but after adding all those options my bowl cost $10. Loved the two different types of home made sriracha also. My co workers got a ramen bowl, noodles, and for the low carb dieter--some steamed veggies with chicken. All were very happy with their food. Service was friendly and good. Liked the vibe. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I love that Down town Gilbert is expanding and all these great places to eat are here including Clever Koi. I've been to the original location and I remember to food we ordered were really good. They offer both indoor and outdoor dining area and provide heaters for the outdoor dining. We started off with the calamari fries which were okay. They were thicker slices and the taste wasn't bad or anything but I've had better calamari . I also would have enjoyed it more if had some kind of dipping sauce for the calamari. My husband got the pork ramen and I got the pulled pork bahn mi. My sandwich was pretty good. I like the hoisin sauce they used along with the pickled slaw and the pulled pork had lots of flavor. Since they used a baguette the bread was a bit hard to eat but the pulled pork made the bread soft on the inside so it wasn't to bad. You can either order a salad or togarashi fries with the meal. I chose the  fries for my side and it did not disappoint. I hate when my fries are soggy and these had a great crunch on the outside and loved the flavor. My husbands ramen came with pork belly,pulled pork, kimchi, nori and bean sprouts. The broth had good flavor and the portion size was good. Overall our server was friendly and attentive and we enjoyed our food. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Quite excited to try this place out during lunch with some girlfriends. Ordered Tuna Chips (Ahi crudo/wasabi guacamole/rice paper chips/bonito aioli), Calamari Fries (mint/furikake/yuzu aioli), Pork Belly Steamed Buns (peanuts/cilantro/hoisin), Roasted Corn Dumplings (sofrito/yuzu marinated tomato/Thai basil/Harissa cream), Short Rib Dumplings (pickled onions/celery leaf salad/shiitake dash/porcini oil), and Seafood Hot Pot (udon/shrimp/calamari steak/scallop/catfish/scallion/cilantro/lime). 
The Tuna Chips and Calamari Fries were my favorites, the others were just okay. The highly recommended Seafood Hot Pot was bland to me, it desperately needed some salt or fish sauce. The service was great and attentive. Will give it another try if I ever in the area and try Duck Curry (udon/roasted potato/pickled peppers/peanut/cilantro) and hopefully will be tastier than the Seafood Hot Pot."}
{"text":"First of all they are very welcoming and have great accommodating service (even for gluten free folk) Austin and boss-man were on point! Love the Saturday brunch! Very refreshing, eclectic flavors! We absolutely love the Thai Basil Gimlet, Bee's Knees, and Aviation HH cocktails! Definitely our new Downtown Gilbert favorite!"}
{"text":"Very inventive and delicious food. The first Brussel sprouts I've ever wanted more of. The beet and goat cheese dumplings were particularly tasty with the tuna chips close behind. If I lived here I go often."}
{"text":"Once i heard the story (maybe it isnt true) about this place and that they were fans of mission chinese is san fran and nyc i had to give it a try. Coming from nyc i was craving some great metropolitan asian food. 

The ambiance was nice. The building itself looks pretty cool. 

Service was good. The bartender and cocktails were awesome. Id say some of the best cocktails ive ever had. 

Food. Also good. Solid. I had the pork ramen - something ive been craving - and it didnt disappoint. Only thing i think could have bee better was the meat cut to be a little less 'tough' i guess. Also had the pork face dumplinga - excellent. And the grilled octopus - also tasty. 

Overall id definitely recommend to others and go back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Great place, we defintely will  be coming back."}
{"text":"Wowwwwww! What a fabulous establishment! The food, wine, cocktails, service, snd atmosphere were TEN!!!! Out of 10!!!!!
Bravo Clever Koi!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at The Clever Koi! A friend introduced this to us for her anniversary dinner. When I first thought of it, the food was going to be okay. But I thought wrong! 
The first time around I ordered soft shell steamed bun, tasted AMAZING! From what I remembered it was fried and what made it amazing was their sauce that came with the steamed bun. I also ordered their top orders which was the pork belly ramen. Again, the flavor was amazing!!! The pork is crispy, it comes with egg, and kimchee and of course the ramen. 
The second time I visited, I ordered their pork steamed bun, again their sauce and how the pork is cooked makes it the best! And for my meal I ordered their seafood ramen soup. Their noodle is more of a udon soup rather than ramen but still tasted good! The seafood inside the soup was fresh, not over cooked either. The best part of going to this place is their service. They are quick to serve and will take good care of you especially Mike whom does a nice job making sure you are taken care of. Good job, Mike, the cooks, and the owners who thought of putting their own twist to Asian style cooking!!"}
{"text":"Located in downtown part of Gilbert. Good location. Nice big parking lot no issues there. The inside is very modern and pleasing to the eye. Good place for a date at night.

Lots of tables and seating. The Windows allow a lot of the natural light in

Waiter and waitress are both very friendly and informative on the menu.

Ramen is a little pricier, I think it was around $15

On the food:
The broth was okay. Noodles were average. However there was definitely not enough noodles if you're hungry. Pork belly was decent but could have more flavor. I wish the broth was spicy, but they have sriracha sauce if you want on the side to make it spicy. However their  sriracha sauce was different from what you're used to in the regular generic bottle. The taste is different, but it was definitely good. 
They also have the green sriracha sauce.

All the other items on the menu were also on the pricier side. Did not try. But sounded good


Would recommend coming here on a date night if you have money to spend. But don't come on a hungry stomach. 

One of the better ramen places that I have been to so far in the Phoenix region. But nothing compared to Taiwan."}
{"text":"One of my if not my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. The food is incredible as well as the drinks. The staff at Clever Koi is knowledgeable and friendly and you will always leave already planning your next visit. It's a must if you have out of town family or friends or if you are here visiting. The owner Nick is a great guy! Duck Curry is my favorite dish and the Bees Knees is my favorite drink!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar this time and much cooler now. Got to see the cook's show up close and converse about the goods they're excited about. Had 3 of the 4 steamed buns - outta dis world!! The *TUNA CHIPS are stupid good! Going to have those all for myself next time. 
Definitely can't wait to go back. Mangia!"}
{"text":"fantastic place. Had the pig face that Josh recommend (i think I had a mouth orgasm) and the duck steamed bun. Talked to a couple other staff and they were great as well. I highly recommend. There are a dozen other things on the menus I wanted to try."}
{"text":"My new favorite Gilbert restaurant. The ramen broths have a ton of flavor, and the drinks are creative. I hope I don't get burnt out."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Rihanna - We Found Love)

The Clever Koi's in my sight
And we're attending for a bite
As the Udon noodles passes by

How it makes my senses come alive.....!
It's the way it's tasting I just can't deny....!
Bo Bites gotta have a go

We found buns in The Clever Koi
We found buns in The Clever Koi
We found buns in The Clever Koi
We found buns in The Clever Koi

This place definitely drew my interest!  Very Clever indeed!  I attended with my foodie group so a lot of sharing.

We ordered a bunch of stuff, but I only remember what we ordered on my side of the table were the Peking duck and octopus bun, the katsui rice, gluten free and regular massamen udon noodles. 

To start my Peking duck was very good except I didn't care much for the charred plum jam.  It just overpowered everything in the bun.  The octopus bun was okay too, I rather eat it nigiri style.  The chicken katsui rice was very good again, but again I thought the teriyaki sauce was just doused over too much.  I like to taste the other ingredients sorry.  My favorite which was not my main dish was the massamen udon noodles. The red curry broth really made this dish pop while the crunch of the nuts gave it texture.  The roast duck and potatoes just melted on your palates while the cilantro gave it a welcoming aroma! - Enjoy!

The place itself had an Asian flare with a modern gastropub feel.  Nice to hangout for a quick bite or to check out their specialty drinks, which they have plenty!  Service can be spotty, but every waiter/waitress has their day! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow, very unexpected.  The food was amazing and so was the service.  We had 2 waitresses Rayan and Sydnie, they were fantastic.  We ordered the Pork Belly buns, Duck Curry Kimchi Fried rice with Duck and for desert we had the fritters.  Fantastic.  My new go to place."}
{"text":"I was very impressed. This is high quality food at very reasonable prices.  The Peking duck bun is amazing, and only $3. We entered the restaurant not knowing much about it, and left knowing that we'll definitely be coming back again. I should mention that the staff is exceptionally welcoming too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are already excited to go back.  It was amazing!  Incredible!  Fantastic!  Our server was informed and friendly.  Our appetizer, divine.  We ordered the steamed bun and we have no words for how amazing it was!  It was so delicious.  And then, by happy accident we received the wrong appetizer and to our surprise a tempuraed tentacle was placed on our table.  We decided to try it anyway, and who knew octopus would be so amazing.  The sauce and the tomato and plum jam was out of this world.  The octopus was so delicious.  We were thrilled with the mistake.  We shared the beef as our main dish.  The charred vegetables were so good.   This was our least favorite dish but we would still give it a very high rating.  But the steamed buns are calling our names, enticing us back for more.  And soon enough we will be happily reunited."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I can't not comment on my latest experience here. I brought a date here recently because the food is killer and I'd been talking it up for some time. We had a seat at the bar and were promptly served waters. Ok good start. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. I'm not joking we both finished our waters before we had to flag down one of the bartenders who had been walking in front of us several times ignoring us. We had to ask for a menu and to get any kind of service. I ordered my drink and my date ordered a beer. The drink took forever and the bartender completely forgot the beer altogether and had to be reminded. Annoying. When they finally asked what we wanted to order he literally WALKED AWAY from us when we were in the middle of ordering and didn't come back for a few minutes. We eventually ordered an appetizer and entrees. Our entrees came out first, then the appetizers about 10 minutes later. Ugh. We were never checked on, and generally were made to feel like an inconvenience. I truly do not know how you get such bad service at the bar when the bartenders are literally confined to the space in front of you, but somehow it happened. The only reason for the two stars is because the food was perfect as always. Otherwise I was horribly embarrassed to have chosen Clever Koi as a date night spot. I probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love Clever Koi! I had the fried forbidden black rice with shrimp which was amazing! I also had a couple of cocktails of course, the pimms cup-yummy. My friend had calamari fries, pad Thai which I recommend as well. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"So wanted to love this place after reading the reviews. Decor/location was perfection and food was pretty good. I probably would not have written any review had the service not been so terrible. Got to restaurant @7pm. For a Friday, not that busy. Counted 18 tables sitting and at least 5 servers with additional hostesses/bussers/managers in the mix. More than enough folks working such a small place. Still we waited to order drinks - 10 minutes. When a server arrived we ordered first round and appetizer's. Drinks (2 beers took another 10 minutes) what the hell? At that point I realized we had actually lost our server and we somehow ended up at a table that no one had claimed. No biggie. Finally flagged down a server - at this point 20 tables sat / 5 servers and asked if we could order our entrees. Received big sigh and \"sure\". Got food and was delish. Sadly, no one came back to ask about food or if we would like another round. Finished dinners (without getting drinks we wanted to order) and sat for 10 minutes before finally flagging down someone to take our dessert order. The level of service we received was lax at best. No thanks, will not be back."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour here with my girl friends. This place was such a disappointment. We should have known when we walked in. There was no one in the resturant. 

I got the zesty noodles a huge disappointment the description was shrimp scallops bulgogi. When I got my noodles it had pieces of cut up shrimp and tiny pieces of scallops. There was no bulgogi. I question the server and she stated that it's bulgogi flavor. To me that is a bit odd. It's like writing steak and getting \"steak flavor.\" 

The server was nice she took off the noodles but I definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Asian fusion is usually hit or miss, but The Clever Koi is somewhere in the middle. Almost everyone at our table ordered the ramen, and that's what was recommended to me too. It was good and mostly made in a traditional style. However, they added kimchi to the dish, and that really threw off the taste. Ramen normally has either a plain soy broth, a rich pork broth, or a miso broth. All of these are mild in flavor. Sometimes you can have spicy ramen, and that is fine too. But the additional sour taste of kimchi didn't go well with it, in my opinion. Otherwise, the rest of the dish was good: noodles were not to stiff or soggy, and all the toppings aside from the kimchi were pretty traditional.

Service here was okay. The server was nice, but food did take a while to arrive."}
{"text":"Yahoo for the Clever Koi!  I come to Phoenix all the time for work, and I try to find local gems whenever I visit.  And this was a score.  

I'm pretty sure a good part of my positive experience had to do with alcohol.  Let's face it, it usually does.   I decided to go for a classic Old Fashioned, and then another, and then another.   What can I say? Whatever they were doing behind the bar was working because they were delish!

Since I was drinking enough carbs, I decided to eat carbless, so I ordered some lettuce cups and wok roasted brussel sprouts.   (I also had a bite of a pork belly bun - holy cow yum).  Although it seems like I ordered the most boring items on the menu, everything I tried was outstanding and full of flavor.  I did not feel like I was skimping out on anything.

The service was very good.  Young, hip, casual guys checking in on us periodically but not overbearing.   

The atmosphere is very modern and trendy which is perfect for this kind of place.   It's small so I imagine there can be a big wait at times.

This may become a new regular spot for upcoming trips to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Nice decor and cocktails. Food was only so so. I like Asian fusion but the flavors just didn't mix well for me."}
{"text":"We had an AMAZING evening here with our friends. Food and drinks are unlike anything else in the area and truly original. The bartenders aren't just mixing drinks...they are crafting perfection - I seriously can't wait to come back and watch these guys work again. All of the sticky buns are to die for and the kimchi rice is phenomenal. We can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Clever Koi, pricey with extremely small portions

I really wanted to enjoy the Clever Koi in Gilbert.  Went there for lunch this past weekend.  
Service was attentive, restaurant was very attractive with a modern, semi-Asian vibe.  We ordered two appetizers, the pork belly buns were very good. The dumplings were tiny and lacked any real character.
But it was one of the lunch entrees that shocked.  My brother ordered the short rib.  Basically what came out was a piece of short rib the size of a 50 cent piece, basically a forkful.  It was outrageous and there were a couple of pieces of cold potato  that the service advised was some kind of deconstructed potato salad.  That was a 20 dollar entrée.  My salmon was similarly tiny but at least it was a tiny \"piece of fish\".  Anyway we won't be returning as the lunch well exceeded $100 and provided basically no food. If this is nuvelle cusine please let everyone know so we can avoid it like the plague.  Service was good but food is ridiculous in price and quantity."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here. First visit was excellent but this visit is underwhelming to say the least. We were seated right away which I appreciated since we did not have reservations and it's a busy Friday night. It took about 20 minutes for a soft drink to be served to our table. An additional 15 minutes after that for our orders to be taken. We asked for our appetizer (steam buns) and entrees to be served at the same time since we've already been waiting for over 35 minutes without food and need to get on with our evening. After we said this, our waitresses immediately says \"I'll have your steam buns out first.\" I'm a little confused. A server came by our table a few minutes later and set down a plate of food which was not ours. The rest of the evening was under whelming. Long waits, food that tasted a little off, and lack of attention from our server made this visit our last."}
{"text":"i love this place. josh makes excellent drinks, $5 build your own lunch bowl and happy hour everyday from 3 - 6. also, mon - wed you can get 2 entree's and 4 beers for $35. (+$5 for liquor drinks)"}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place is wonderful. First note, get there early or make sure you have a reservation as you will have to wait because this place is always packed. However I will say the wait is definitely worth it. I had the pleasure of meeting my friend Kathy for some nibbles and drinks before going a to watch her lovely brother sing in a holiday concert. We sat at the bar, which was also a treat because you get to watch and interact with the chefs. I will say watching them work their magic was memorizing. Oh before I go any further, I also got a nice surprise treat as I ran in to my fabulous former coworker Sam, whom I had not seen in person in YEARS! Now that alone was worth it. (thank you again Sam for treating Kathy and I to a round of drinks)

Kathy and I shared the pork belly buns along with the chicken and waffle buns. My lord who comes up with this stuff? I swear I could have had about 3 of each of them they were that good. The pork belly was nice and crispy on the outside and melted in your mouth with every bite. The chicken was also cooked to perfection and had the chili maple syrup gave it the little kick that you needed.

Needless to say I will be back again as I want to try EVERYTHING on the menu. You know for research lol."}
{"text":"Interesting Asian fusion restaurant. Something different from the usual run of the mill places. Parking in back was abundant and free, which was a nice bonus downtown. Nice and quiet restaurant with a menu full of house-created drinks. $11 seems a bit steep for cocktails but they were plenty strong so I can't complain. Hubs had the duck curry and it was good, but definitely on the spicy side. He liked it but it was too much heat for me. I had the salmon noodle salad, which was awesome. Something I wouldn't normally have ordered but I really enjoyed it. It was a great mix of flavors and textures."}
{"text":"My husband and I were there for happy hour, loved the burger.  Very nice hip place.  I would recommend changing out those wicker light fixtures, they are outdated.  I will recommend this restaurant to others"}
{"text":"I ADORE Clever Koi. Not once have I had a bad experience here. I am (probably) the Pork Ramen's biggest fan. Not only do I go out of my way to eat there, but I have ordered take-out and from Post-Mates many, many times because their food is amazing. Noodles, rice, steamed buns... amazing!

I really appreciate that the food and customer service is consistent and exceptional. It's a small location that houses some of the most knowledgeable staff members I have met. Great location for a date night or meet up with friends. Great drinks & music are always a super plus as well.

I heart you Clever Koi. Since I have already told all the people I know about you, I thought I would finally share it with the Yelp universe."}
{"text":"Clever Koi never ceases to amaze us. From the minute we walk in we are treated like celebrities. We always choose to be seated at the Wok bar, where the chefs are extremely friendly and very interactive. They provide tons of insight as to what they are currently making. Also our favorite drink the house Gin and Tonic is to die for. Love this place. I give it a 10 for everything, from ambience to the stellar customer service. Well done Clever Koi...Much Respect and love you guys"}
{"text":"I cannot think of a single thing I did not appreciate about this experience. Rinks: did the Hey Bartender said gin, cucumber and mint and they brought out an amazing drink.  Must do: salt and pepper shrimp, smoked pig face and the creamy broccoli I broth. I will be coming back. Ask for Daisy she is a fabulous guide!"}
{"text":"Very unique menu and tastes. Lots of craft cocktails. Staff were friendly and helpful. Upbeat hip vibe. A little loud for our old ears. A tad pricey. Deserves 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience here tonight! We shared several small bites including the soft shell crab bun, goat cheese dumplings, kimchi chicken and waffles and the short rib appetizer. We shared the pad thai entree with shrimp and finished our meal with the banana fritters and pear rice cobbler - yum!!! Prices are reasonable and the service was wonderful! This restaurant is a must if you're in the central Phoenix area!!"}
{"text":"The Clever Koi was a point of contention between my husband and I... you see, he knew I wanted to try it for a really long time, and he actually had the audacity to go there without me one night with friends.  How dare he!

I'm kidding... kind of.  I really was wanting to check out The Clever Koi since they first opened, and Jared really did go there without me, knowing damn well that I wanted to go.  But, he made up for it and took me there on a date a few weeks later... and then I went there with some work colleagues (without Jared) just the other night as well.  

So, I'm now two visits down with many more to go... TCK's menu changed slightly between my visits, but I enjoyed everything I had.  Service was attentive, food - creative, tasty and filling.  There is something for everyone on the drink list.  There is indoor and outdoor seating. The ambiance is casual and comfortable and not too loud.

Highlights on the current menu in my eyes are:
-Wood Grilled Octopus
-Summer Corn Gyoza
-Massaman Curry Noodles
-Summer Corn Ramen Noodles

I highly recommend sharing / family style if you go with adventurous eaters... it's fun to taste a bunch of different things!  Kudos to the guys behind this place... crafty, clever, and keeping things fresh.  TCK is worth a visit (or several)!"}
{"text":"Great creative menu and excellent service. The food was tasty and loved the atmosphere. Excellent lighting... Not too bright and not too dark. Fun younger trendy crowd."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and service is good. Always busy when we go. Patio is protected from the street noise."}
{"text":"Today is my 30th birthday and since it's a milestone, I decided to Yelp locally and find a new place. I read the reviews and saw they were positive so I happened to decide that this is where I'd like to spend my 30th birthday. 
I got all in my finest attire and stepped on out to the world. The ambience is great and more dressy than casual which is exactly what I was looking for. The alcohol that adorned the wall behind that bar was vast as well. We were greeted immediately upon entering and were seating promptly.
My sister and I took advantage of the \"2\" deal which was two meals and four cocktails for $30. 
Beyond a great deal IMO. We had two cocktails each and appetizers to start. 
I had the curry and my sister had the salmon bibimbap. 
Everything was beyond delicious. My food actually had spice to it too which I appreciate as I fancy spicy foods. 
We were also given complimentary peach fritters for my birthday for dessert which were phenomenal.
Service 5 star
Ambience 5 star 
Food 5 star
Overall you guessed it, 5 star
Highly recommended and I'll visit again"}
{"text":"We arrived at Clever Koi without reservations and found this place very busy. We were greeted right away and told it would be 45 minutes.  Our party of 4 decided to wait it out. We were surprised at the size of the place. Very small w a larger bar area. 

After our 45m wait, we were seated and forgot about for at least 20 more mins. Even after finally getting a server she was not very attentive.... dropped off menus... never asked about if we had been there before or made any suggestions.  I dislike that. A little small talk is needed. I dont like to feel like a number, next guest.

Overall, the food wasnt anything to write home about. I actually disliked the ramin I got. 

I dont recommend this place...other places in the area are better in terms of service and food"}
{"text":"Ok. I had really high hopes for this place. Shame on me for not mentioning to the many wait staff who visited our table. 

I would like to begin by saying their drink list is insane. They have a curry drink. Like a for real adult beverage containing curry. It was a shame that for me, the curry didn't come through as much as the bitter did or the black lemon or whatever it was that made me not a fan. Surprising, I never thought I would ever say I didn't like something curry. Jailbird is what the guy had and didn't seem to mind it. 

So, the food. I couldn't get far past the lettuce wraps. They came to the table and upon first glance I asked \"oh, is this like ceviche?\" It looked raw, grey shrimpos.... upon first bite, well, that was the last bite. I began to wonder if it was fish sauce that overpowered the dish or if it was raw foul rotten seafood. That was it for me. The pork steam bun like taco thing was good. It reminded me of Chinatown steam buns in Toronto, kind of. 

We got spicy seafood hotpot. To me, it smelled like the lettuce wraps but everything at that point tasted like the lettuce wraps. I just couldn't. Maybe we will come back but for the fact it was supposed to be my birthday celebratory awesome dinner. I was very not stoked.

The atmosphere was on point. The wait staff was great but the food? NOT at all my favorite or even like close to inviting me back. I was really wanting that bite that just makes you go mmmmmm... which is what I thought my guy was telling me... No, he wasn't sure if it was bad and needed my first bite to confirm what he was feeling about it himself. 

Like I said, maybe we will give them another try but it will have to be after I forget tonight."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend of mine and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  We ordered bao or Asian steamed buns and they were totally delicious.  We also had these sweet potato pot stickers that I literally could have eaten like 10 of those!  I had a super yummy cocktail that I asked the waiter to tell the bartender I wanted something sweet and delicious so I couldn't tell you what it was called.  I also enjoyed their lemongrass ramen, which was full of flavor and the broth was outstanding!  Their green tea tiramisu was definitely outside of the box, but super delicious to finish the meal!  super yum!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to C.K. in years and I'm not sure why. So glad to return! - - Cocktails (aviation, gin gimlet) were perfectly balanced. I went with the classics since they were on HH, but several from their main list were tempting.
- Black bean pancakes ($7 during HH) were not what I expected, more shredded celery root than black bean, but really tasty.
- Chopped salad ($8 during HH) good size, lots of yummy ingredients, fab dressing. Just what I wanted!

Our server was so sweet- bringing a kids version of chow mein and fresh squeezed OJ for my 2 yr old dining buddy. 

Definitely need to add this place back to the regular rotation!"}
{"text":"I have been searching far and wide for decent Ramen in the valley and I think I may have finally found it..and on the happy hour menu no less :)  It came with pork belly and kimchee!  I just wish it was piping hot but it may have cooled down as we were noshing on the wedge salad and short ribs.  The cocktails were equally refreshing and they have a great patio area.  Great service, I will definitely be back to this downtown gem :)"}
{"text":"We've been to clever koi 3 times and every time we have a great meal. Last night I had the special which was, Korean Fried Chicken, and it amazing!! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Meet up with some friends for HH at Clever Koi, and I have been meaning to try this place out for a while so I was happy to get the chance.   I love the feel of the place, even the outside patio area, which is where I want to dine one night, it just looks cool to me.

On the HH menu they have ramen for 5 bucks, never have had ramen before and not really being a person who eats soups (more of a curry, stew kind of girl) I thought eh for 5 bucks, why not try it. Well am I am glad I did!

The broth was good, and inside the ramen was roasted pork, house bacon, pickled mustard greens, shiitake mushrooms, bean sprouts and a soft egg, it looked soo good, picked up the chop sticks and went right at it! I popped the egg and let it get all happy in the broth, and picked up a piece of that bacon, omg the bacon is soo good. The broth to me needed something but Clever Koi makes their own sriracha sauce and added that to the broth and BAM! That did the trick! 

For my 1st ramen experience, this was a great bowl of it! Now its left me craving more and can't wait to get back to it!"}
{"text":"What a great new place!  The food and cocktails are fantastic!  The Pork Belly Ramen was so full of flavor!  The wings were crisp and the sauce was amazing.  They make a really good house made sauces and the Kimchi is perfect!  


The staff was friendly and helpful!  Cute place and we WILL be back!"}
{"text":"We have been twice now to the clever koi, and both times had a great experience. The food, atmosphere, and service is top notch - we had Mercy as our server each time (they work as a team, but she was our main contact), and we were very impressed with our service.  My wife has quite a few food intolerances  (including wheat and soy...I wasn't quite thinking picking date night at an Asian restaurant when my wife has a soy allergy!),  but  each time they were very accommodating and able to make a dish that worked for her.  The food is unique and they have some great spins on certain dishes. Definitely recommend the black bean and celery root pancakes as an appetizer."}
{"text":"This place has such a good Tuesday/Wednesday night deal! You get 2 noodle or rices dishes and 4 draft beers for $40. Portions are pretty large. The food was so good! I got the pork ramen and my husband got the seafood hot pot. Both were really delicious. We sat at the bar, service was quick. Would definitely recommend for a cheap date night."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and we ordered three dishes. The 3 buns for $12.50 (it's quite expensive), a tuna and chips, and the pork ramen. 

Hands down the buns were delicious - I loved the soft shell crab one! I highly recommend giving that a try even though it's more on the expensive side. 5 stars on that dish!

I didn't try the tuna and chips but my husband said the tuna was very fresh and he'd give it a 4 stars.

The pork ramen was ehhh..if you're craving ramen don't come here, there are better places. They were being \"clever\" by giving us fried pork but a good chunk of it was all fat..but that was pretty different; however, the broth and the noodles? You can easily just make instant noodles and get the same taste. 2 stars for the pork ramen!

Overall it was good, the buns really kept this place at 4 stars me. I'd give it 3.5 but we can't do .5 so 4 it is (also customer service was good)."}
{"text":"We ordered two apps, the octopus  and the calamari fries. Before we sat down, Roman, the mixologist, made the most amazing drinks for us while we waited for our table. I would definitely recommend the The enabler and he makes a mean - ass old fashion."}
{"text":"Although the modern and hip vibe is cool the food here is fine but not inspired. The bar appears to be more popular and with good reason. The lunch specials have a great reputation and the create your own concept seems like it would be popular. The dinners however were priced high for rice or ramen noodle specialties and lacked the extra flavor that most folks might be looking for. Great place to share a drink for some urban sophisticated crowds. Be wary of the small parking lot, like many new Central Ave eateries they are banking on light rail users."}
{"text":"This restaurant is our go to for good food in the valley. We bring all of our out of town visitors to experience this greatness. The atmosphere is a very chill vibe and the wood fire stove gives it some more pizazz. The cocktails are very innovative and fun. Happy hour is always an amazing deal, all of the classic cocktails can be sampled for a great price. The standout classics are bees knees and manhattan for me personally. The spicy tuna chips, wings and black bean pancakes are also on happy hour specials and they will change your life or at least your taste buds just a little. The buns are a definite must when ordering, our favorite is the chicken and waffle. The fried rice is amazing especially the duck. The desserts are rotating all delicious all of the time.  Overall this restaurant is always winning when it comes to service, drinks and food."}
{"text":"I hover between 3 1/2 stars to 4 stars for this place only because well, prob because I'm Chinese and while I appreciate the decor, atmosphere, and service here the food just seemed a bit tad expensive for what you get. 
I mean dumpling with kim chee is a good combination but I don't remember what the price point was. I just remember bear with it- it's the place. I mean for the price, I want a big platter of dumplings and a whole jar of kim chee- not the three or four dumplings that we got!  Same thing with the ramen. I was like, how much for the bowl of noodles???
Okay, okay, I am sure I've been spoiled by Japan town in LA or actual ramens in Japan. 
Admittedly, I did enjoy the atmosphere and decor. I think it's a good place to take a date or for a business meeting. And the food is good even if the portions are small. 
I guess when I get my Asian on, I want to be belly full with left overs to go!"}
{"text":"For those of you that think Friday is too busy you should come out on Monday. It was comfortably packed and the ambiance was nice and calm. We had all of the happy hour specials and they were fantastic. The green beans with the duck tongue was an interesting experiment but we thoroughly enjoyed it. The burger with the kimchi and cabbage was tasteful. The pork udon soup was flavorful. Another review said the noodles were packaged like, but they were fresh and toothsome, which is al dente or semi firm the way noodles should be. Chicken wings were just the right amount of spice. 
All the waitstaff were pleasant and helpful. Enjoyed watching the wood grill being worked and the bartender looked skilled."}
{"text":"The Clever Koi is located in a beautiful space and serves up some of the best Asian-inspired food I've had in the valley. It's pricey, but totally worth it! They also don't skimp on portions so you do get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Clever Koi is a solid restaurant that could definitely become stunning with a few changes. Parts of the restaurant were lovely and parts were underwhelming.

I'm going to lead with what went right on our visit. Service was prompt and good, just the right balance of being attentive without being overwhelming. 

The ambiance was stellar, I felt like I was somewhere along the California coast. We sat in the patio area which had comfy seats, and well groomed and taken care of plants. 

The bao style buns were perfectly executed - we had the soft shell and catfish. They came with a soy like sauce which I felt was unnecessary and didn't add anything to the dish. These pair well with their green house sriracha. 

The house hot sauces are delicious, not to spicy but just enough kick with actual flavor. We found the red to be smoky and the green to be sweet.
 
The bao were pricey, but did at least deliver. They offer three for $12.50 which puts you at $4.17 a piece. The problem is when you have two people, usually you need four and get stuck purchasing the fourth for $4.50. I would recommend any above three be priced at $4.17 so you don't feel overcharged. 

The corn dumplings were good and presented nicely, but I just cannot get behind the $10 price tag - $7.50 would be closer to their value. The dumplings were also served in a very large bowl only half full. 

The Pad Thai was our least favorite.. it's not that the ingredients chosen weren't fresh and of quality.. it was the execution. Nothing was overcooked, but the sauce did not deliver. The sauce was a muddy mess between a Pad Thai you would expect and a satay sauce that fell into the mix. I much prefer a more classic Pad Thai, which is a perfect balance of heat, sweet and tang. The toasted peanut pieces, strong cilantro and tang of lime were missing here. I wish the menu clarified this dish was more of a satay sauce, because I would have gone another route. 

All proteins in the Pad Thai were extra. I didn't feel the 4 medium shrimp were quite enough for a $5 add in. I would like to see 6 shrimp or 4 extra large for this dish.

The dessert selection made it tough to choose. They make their own house mochi and today it was Fruity Pebbles - how creative. There was also a pineapple upside down cake and banana fritters. We opted for the banana fritters.

The banana fritters were coated with sugar and spice like donut holes and served with a salty caramel. I would have liked to have seen less sugar on the outside of the fritters, because I felt it limited my use of the delicious caramel sauce. The ice cream was extra and for $4.50 you got two mini scoops which accounted for about a scant 1/2 cup serving. I would expect to pay no more than $3 for the portion of ice cream which was of average quality.

No drinks were ordered and the bill came to $59.19 with tax. My recommendation is go for the buns, ambience and skip the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"A group of us (8 total) came here for lunch from work to celebrate a birthday. Things looked promising when we were first sat down. The waitress was friendly and began to take our drink orders. A few of us ordered iced teas and one of my coworkers next to me requested lemon for his water. When she returned she did not bring any sweeteners for the iced teas and forgot my coworker's lemon. We kept waiting for her to come back around so we could request them but it was very hard to catch her attention. Once we were finally able to it still took a long time for her to bring them as she kept waiting on other tables and taking orders. Finally she returned with the sweetener and took our orders. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. We began to notice that people that had come in after us and ordered after us were already eating and there we still sat waiting. We all began watching the time on our phones - after all, we were all at lunch from work and really needed to get back to the office. Finally the food began to arrive in piecemeal fashion. I ordered the Pork Belly Steamed Bun and the Fried Forbidden Black Rice. The Pork Belly Steamed Bun was excellent and left me wanting more. The bun was soft and the pork belly was cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I could have eaten another 5 of those and been happy! It left me really wanting to try the other options they have. My Fried Forbidden Black Rice was good too. The flavors really went well together and the number of shrimp was commensurate with the amount of rice. However, my first reaction when I saw the bowl was \"...$15 for this small amount?!...\"  It did fill me up but I couldn't help but wonder if I would have still been hungry if I hadn't had the pork steamed bun beforehand. The rest of our party (for the most part) was happy with their entrees. I did hear that the chicken was overcooked on the Chow Mein's and the Chopped Salad was described as \"very heavy\" but nobody had any big complaints. When she brought the bill we realized we had forgotten to ask her to give us separate checks and she stated she wasn't allowed to do that on groups over 6 anyways. She told us that we had to figure out how much we wanted on everyone's cards and she would run them that way. Some of my coworkers found they had been charged for the protein in their Chow Mein's and when they inquired about it the waitress explained that it doesn't come with - even though the menu is very misleading and states \"choice of protein\" in the description. So needless to say their total came to more than they had bargained for. So I don't know if I will be back - at least for lunch. Although the food was good, I just felt that it was very pricy for what you actually get. Maybe it was because it was lunchtime and they don't expect the portions to be as big but if that's the case then they should knock off something for the reduced portions during lunch."}
{"text":"Food was not that good and very small portions. Pretty much a rip off when it comes to quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? This place is perfect. The overall design and aesthetic is relaxing, low key, and cute. 

The food was fantastic and bursting with flavor. Since it was my first time there, I wanted an introspective take on the menu, and that's when Nick (one of the 4 owners) came over and walked me through the menu as well as his favorite items. 

We started with the chicken fried chicken wings. They were exceptional. The black sesame syrup they drizzled on top was delicious and unlike anything I've tasted. Next, we ordered the smoked \"pig face\" dumplings. These were by far my favorite of the night. Served with kimchi and pickled peppers and their own in house made sriracha. So delicious, I was sad there was only 4! Next, we had one of their steamed buns with the pulled pork. Very delicious, although, I wasn't a fan of the bun itself. Only because this entree comes with two sauces for dipping and the bun would get too spongey.  And finally, we ordered our main dish. I got the chicken katsu with a soft poached egg. SO GOOD. The sauce was a perfect blend of spicy and sweet.

Also, to drink, you have to try the Donny Wang Fiz. Super refreshing and perfect with your meal.

Our server Sydney was very attentive and super nice. The customer service there is outstanding. And the location is perfect, right next door to one of my favorite watering holes, the George and Dragon. 

I will definitely be back, and next time to get in on their happy hour!"}
{"text":"If you're ever in Phoenix for whatever reason, this is a must try.  I am a huge fan of pork so of course I got the pork belly ramen bowl and it was amazing!  However, my first choice would have been the duck curry bowl, but my stomach was at odds with me that evening. I must add everyone at our table felt the same way with their choices on the menu.  Didn't have a problem getting seated on a Saturday evening and we even sat outside with the heat but that was even a pleasant experience with the misters outside and no we didn't get doused with water;-)"}
{"text":"Very good selection of food.  We tried the Toast appetizer which is wood grilled sourdough with tofu ricotta,  Japanese eggplant,  heirloom tomatoes with a smoked soy gastrique.  The only thing was I didn't care for the gastrique.  It left an odd taste in my mouth.  
The pig face Kimchi dumplings were awesome. Melt in your mouth.  
Also tried the Chow Mein with duck. It was a step up from other Chow Mein that I've had.  
Also ordered a Manhattan which was made well.  Nice smooth drink. 
Still gave it 5 stars for the service and ambiance. But be warned, the prices are a little high."}
{"text":"Love the Clever Koi! Food and flavor are great, and the atmosphere always sets a nice tone for your meal. Their steamed jackfruit dumplings are insane. I could eat them as a meal on their own! Also recommend their craft cocktails. They have some unique ones as well as your classics."}
{"text":"My wife and I waited to come in until the opening kinks were worked out, well worth the wait.  This place is beautiful, has great food, friendly service, and was an overall great dining experience.

It looks like they have a pretty good happy hour, we went for lunch.  I enjoyed the pig face dumplings, octopus and duck buns (don't worry they were individual).   The kim chi and homemade sriracha on the dumplings were delicious.  If you get the ramen make sure to ask your server about the broth, be prepared as it is a \"clever\" take on ramen and one you may not be used to, but still very tasty.

Last but not least don't park in G&D's parking lot, they will tow and that could ruin a good dining experience.  Thank you Clever Koi, we will be back (and probably often)."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and each visit I have tried something new. I love Clever Koi and they understand how to hire good people. Each staff member has been so kind, helpful, personable and accommodating. The food is delicious and ask for recommendations because we tried things that were wonderful, but would not have ordered on our own. Also, best margarita! Go to Clever Koi!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times now, each time trying different dishes...all have been very good...tasty, well prepared/cooked, presented nicely, and creative combinations! The noodle dishes (both ramen & udon) were fantastic, duck terrific, steamed buns yummy! The vibe of this place is Cen Pho hip...cool staff, music, and beautiful building. I continue to crave their food and ask friends and family to come try it so I can return. Looking forward to trying the cocktails, look awesome. I'll continue to enjoy this spot!"}
{"text":"This has to be my top 5 fav restaurants in Phx to try. Fun and tasty creations. I would recommend the pork bellys, chicken and waffles steam buns, rabbit gyoza, octopus and share these plates with your party like small plates. Cocktails are good and well crafted. The atmosphere is fun and hip. A great place to eat and unwind for the weekend. Have been here several Times and keep Coming back for more !!"}
{"text":"Really unique menu with amazing food! We ordered  many different things including their ramen and it was all extremely delicious. We also had a super kind and attentive server. Will definitely keep coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Went out with friends for a birthday celebration, restaurant was flexible with the changes in party size and time which was great. Most places would huff and puff and give attitude. The food is good, drinks are OK. What could improve is the speed of service. The night/time we went wasn't particularly busy but it seemed to take the kitchen an awful long time get food out, we where in view of the kitchen staff and happened to see a lot of laughter and even waitstaff just sitting around. We waited over an hour for two appetizers and another hour for food. Two people at the table never got their orders and by that time it was already like \"ok, lets go.\" The waitress was apologetic and kept saying that they're getting a rush of orders (which was hard to believe as the place wasn't full), and comped a meal. Hire more waitstaff, and get on the kitchen for screwing around."}
{"text":"Loved this place the food was amazing and the service was outstanding. The food was so fresh and everything came out very quickly.  The steamed buns and dumplings were delicious.  I am a vegetarian and had the jackfruit steamed buns and loved them.  I just wish we lived in AZ so that we could enjoy this place it would be a favorite of ours for sure."}
{"text":"Great place for food. Probably the best Chinese I've had in Phoenix.Even the Servers are nice and friendly people."}
{"text":"The Clever Koi serves great noodle dishes that are not as heavy as its traditional counterparts. The broth served at the Clever Koi is not the traditional Tonkotsu broth one might expect at a noodle establishment, but that is what sets The Clever Koi apart. A feature worth writing home about is the Build-Your-Own-Bowl. Here, TKC allows diners to customize his or her noodle or rice bowls. Diners can choose noodle, broth, protein, and vegetable fixings to create his or her own magical Clever-Koi-Creation. The end creation is filling but, by no means, heavy. The veggies are crisp, the broth is light, which when combined allowed me to enjoy a bowl of udon/ramen noodles without having to sacrifice 30 minutes of my afternoon to nap. 

Have a hankering for asian soup noodles but want to feel a little healthy while consuming it? COME HERE.

Although I usually don't include notes on atmosphere, TKC has great scene. I would sum it up as Zen vibe with modern fixtures. I enjoy the dark metals and wood pieces. I feel like West Elm outfitted the establishment. Additionally, its worth to note that parking is located behind the building. If you are coming down Central Ave,turn into the street right before TKC and you should see a parking lot. 

4 stars = I'm a fan. I refrained from giving 5 stars because the service was sub-par. Did I come at an off time? Was the girl who served my party our dishes having a bad day?? IDK, but icky vibes can really affect one's dining experience."}
{"text":"The rabbit dumplings are so damn good. I really like everything about this place. The architecture and decor are on point and comfortable. Very trendy. 

The outdoor seating was relaxing and had a great atmosphere. When I came it was really busy but that only added to the environment. My buddy got the Ramen and he said the broth and noodles worked well together.  

I would say go later on in the day when the sun has gone down. The way the restaurant is setup is best at night. 

Very cool spot spot! Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner with the family.  What a great experience!  The kimchi fried rice with pork belly was amazing.  We ordered a few dishes and we were happy with all of them.  Super friendly staff.  Welcome to Gilbert you have some fans"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything we ordered was awesome. Highly recommend the Fried Rice and the Chicken & Waffles! Waiter was also great at handling a large party (15!) But would have preferred a split check."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to have dinner. Great cocktail menu, seasonal choices and delicious options for everyone! Great vegetarian choices too! TRY the steamed buns"}
{"text":"Just.... wow... such a new fresh take on Chinese themed food. Pad Thai. Too die for. Cooked to perfection with a flavor explosion. I am very impressed. My fiancé ordered the Chow mien... you know it's Deeeeelish when there's no need for soy sauce. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"It is worth searching for this place off Central, if only to try their Ramen bowls
I had the pork belly with pork broth, very good! They are made to order bowls, I could not resist my fav egg on top
For app we split The Pig Face fried wontons filled with pig, kimchi on the side!
Great Ambience terrific looking bar
Give it a shot"}
{"text":"In retrospect, it strikes me that the Cleverest of Koi swim away from this place.

Wasted Potential: A Matter of Style over Substance ---- 

It sure looked OK from a distance. I walked in open minded and excited and left disappointed, somewhat offended, and with a mild ache in my wallet. The atmosphere is pleasant at first, then you start to feel the desperate pretension creep in. 

This is the type of place that's just trying too hard to stand out, but fails to excel at anything. I'm all for fusion, but it's like this place knows the words to the song they're trying to sing you, but they can't carry the tune.

The Pork Belly Steamed Bun was OK. But the frozen ones I get 12 to a bag for $7.99 from Lee Lee's are substantially better. 

I also got the Zesty Noodles. \"Bulkogi\" is listed as an ingredient. Now, I'm really familiar with BULGOGI, having lived with a Korean family during 9th and 10th grades. Hell, I've been making my own bulgogi from scratch since I was 15. While waiting for my Zesty Noodles, I Googled Clever Koi's mystery spelling of the iconic Korean BBQ fare. I found it is a Finnish derivation. 

Well, my noodle dish arrived. There was little Bulgogi about what Clever Koi served me, Finnish or not. And wow, the Kimchi was God awful.

Waiting on the check... one look at the Clever Koi website helped me understand Clever Koi better. See, I don't buy into the pretentious Restaurant Rock Star thing. Why are there pictures of the owners on the top, most important, page of the site? How does that help the customer? Ostentatious, the whole front page... osty osty osty... just thick with it.

I really need the substance. Atmosphere only gets me in the door. I just couldn't give a damn less about the style, iffin ya ain't got the substance. We over tipped. Man, I needed something to feel good about as I walked out.

I left thinking, I would have been better off grabbing some Panda Express To-Go, pullin' a couple chairs up close to the Clever patio area so's to sack in on the pleasant Koi atmosphere, and then wippin' out a vintage Zippo lighter an' burning 3 or 4 Twenties, looking all G wit my styrofoam container and chopsticks. Bah, that don't factor in no alcohol. Hmm. Close, but the idea needs work. 

{In and of itself, the previous paragraph is a fine example of style over substance.} 

So Imma gonna swim away. Where my Koi at?

OK, enough fun. Want good Asian food and/or and interesting cultural experience? There's a whole world of discovery awaiting you all up and down Dobson Road. For Korean try Hodori or Koreatown. Seriously, just go explore. 

To the owners/chefs: Thailand, Korea, China, Vietnam, Japan, and Indo-China deserve representation from you. Please go try some places along Dobson's Little Asia. Immersing yourselves in the origins of what you're trying to exploit may lead you to more successful end results with your fusion dishes. Knowing how and where to start will serve you well."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Clever Koi in forever and finally decided to go for happy hour. The parking lot is tiny, but looks like there is valet later in the day. The restaurant is next to some type of salon and wine place. We got sat at the patio and I love the decor - trendy, earthy, and very relaxing. 

Our waitress wasn't the sweetest by any means, but we made due. We ordered the pork belly and duck steamed buns, the wood fired grill plate with steak, and the shrimp toasts. The pork belly steamed buns were good, the duck was not - way too dry and lacked flavor. The wood fired grill plate took forever to get to our table, but it was just ok. The shrimp toasts were ok too. We were full and had not left much on the plates for a doggie bag.

All in all - I definitely am happy that I came to try it out, but this whole Asian fusion trend is not working for me. Yes, I get the \"trendy\" ambiance, but I guess I expect what I grew up with at asian restaurants - big portions, lots of flavor and sauce, reasonably priced, and you leave with a doggie bag!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent as always.

Our table ordered:
Korean Fried Chicken - 4.5 out of 5 
(Chicken was tender inside and crispy on the outside, took off half a star for the biscuit, which was doughy - probably a little undercooked.)
Kimchi Burger - 5 out of 5 (the fries were extra awesome - crispy and well seasoned)
Pork Ramen - 5 out of 5 (this is always a winner here)
Spicy Seafood Hot Pot - 5 out of 5 (They also reduced the spiciness slightly for us, and the seafood was cooked to perfection)
Chicken & Waffle buns - 4 stars! (waffles were a bit soggy, but the chicken was absolutely tender, and the skins were shatteringly crisp, good overall flavor)
Soft Shell Crab bun - 5 out of 5 (this is also always a winner here - well balanced flavors and textures)

Service: 5 out of 5 for sure! Our server was absolutely on point, warm and polite, checked to make sure we were happy with everything, kept us refilled on waters, never made us feel rushed, offered to split our checks and asked if we wanted to split a dish between checks as well. Best ever. 

We always bring any out of town guests we have to Clever Koi - whether it is the Phoenix or Gilbert locations, and these guys always deliver."}
{"text":"Great drinks and great service. The wait was quite a bit longer than the said but other than that couldn't be more pleased with the restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious, but go for dinner- lunch menu is limited."}
{"text":"The food was wonderfully delicious and the drink spectacularly unique and fun. Love the atmosphere and plan to visit again!"}
{"text":"Food and a beer out on the front outdoor dinning was great.  We miss judged the portions as baby boomers so abit small for hungry guys. Fine for the ladies.  Great wine buy glass as well.  Missing deserts on a Monday night...
We will definately come back."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Ordered drinks... waited.  Then ordered appetizers.  Guess what- got appetizers before drinks.  Get it?  Service horrible.  Food was also poor.  Had the most tasteless pad Thai ever.  Won't be back here."}
{"text":"My Husband and I love coming here!!! Food is really good and cocktails are hands down the best in the entire valley!!! Liam the bartender is so friendly and makes amazing drinks.. will even make up one for you if it isn't already on the menu. If you haven't been here yet, then you definitely need to try it!!!"}
{"text":"I love to support local businesses, and Clever Koi had been on my list for a while. The environment is busy but still very intimate, and I was able to have a conversation with my friend without any bother from other noises. The food was amazing!! I ordered the pork cheek dumplings and pork ramen, and it was the best ramen I've had in a very long time. Everything was great quality, and the staff was really sweet and helpful."}
{"text":"If my dinner were an episode of Friends, it would be titled \"The One Where Lillian W Became a Human Trashcan,\" because that pretty much was the theme of the night. A friend of mine asked, \"so...do you pretty much eat everything?\" -- Yes. Yes, I certainly do - why else would I strategically position myself in the center of a party of 15!?!

5 stars because this place just has a large range of scrumptious and innovative options (food AND drink)!! I wouldn't say it's the best restaurant I've been to, but I absolutely LOVE that they have a wide variety of food - AND the menu options rotate seasonally!!! I left already thinking of the next time I could come back, and that, my Yelp friends, is a definite 5 stars in my book.

I went for happy hour for a birthday (no prior notice to the restaurant), and the host/servers were SO accommodating!! We were seated pretty much right away, and multiple servers, including our own (Austin) were so attentive to all our needs, coming in continuously to check up on us. He was also so understanding when we had the very classic large party difficulty of splitting the bill. 

Drinks were great! I love all the HH options and honestly couldn't decide between quite a few of them (I guess this means I'll have to go back!) I ended up going with the Pimm's Cup as a tribute to my previous days in London and I was transported back to happy times drinking pitchers in Regent's Park. I also LOVED the Bee's Knees!! There was a drink with sage that was really unique too. In general - I don't think you could've gone wrong with any of the drinks as long as you know what ingredients you like!

Now, on to the food (that I pretty much sampled all of....)
-Spicy Tuna Chips - I didn't love this because I thought the tuna was a little overly fishy (there's a Chinese word for this that resembles \"briny\" I guess?) In theory it was a great combo.
-Soft Shell Crab Po'Boy - I don't usually LOVE Po'Boys and I tend to actually dislike olives, but this combo was really working for me. I recommend trying this out! Additionally, these FRIES ARE ADDICTING. I'm pretty sure I ate some of everyone's fries...
-Pork Ramen - I consider myself a seasoned ramen expert, and this didn't really stand out to me. It looked so aesthetic, and the egg yolk was so so beautiful. It was a really nice and hearty portion, but nothing wowed me. Still it wasn't at all bad to eat, I just found other things yummier.
-Koi Burger - also just not bad for me. I like my patties to be a little more juicy/medium rare than their patties. If I were in the mood for a sandwich/burger, I'd def pick the Po'Boy over this
-Duck Fat Sriracha Wings - Good, but I probably wouldn't single these out to order again. 
-Calamari Fries - omg YUM. Would definitely recommend

And yup. There goes....ALL of the HH items that contain meat. Can't wait to come back and try all the new items!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Pretty good but not your traditional Asian food. Get some dessert before you leave. Dem Critters doe..."}
{"text":"My experience here was awesome.    They sat us outside and the service was kick-ass.   By kick-ass I mean that the waiter knew the menu, was attentive was a cool guy.  He made us some great suggestions and had a little fun with our group of 8.    We liked him immediately.  

the place is immaculate and the service is fast.   All good signs that whomever is running this place knows what they're doing.   The food is good as well.   

I got the seafood Hot Pot, a couple of steamed bun appetizers and an old fashioned.    We enjoyed each others conversation, enjoyed the food and had a great time. 

The whole place adds up for me:.  5 stars.   We'll be back!   Glad you're in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. It's hiding on Central between Camelback and Indian School but when you find it, you'll know why I think of if so highly.
Hip, urbane, daring, spicy, The Clever Koi has it going. Noodles or rice, octopus or pork belly, tofu or beef ribs....it's a riot in a bowl. The chefs love to mix it up ( at lunch, you order and they put what you want on the bowl). The menu changes every 3-4 months but it only gets better. Go there. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a real treat. The Chicken Ramen is life-changing and the drinks are incredibly unique. Mixology is a real thing and the bartenders here no how to make a drink."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice so far. I plan on going again on my birthday. The cocktails are out of this world. I dont like the taste of alcohol and the mixologists are amaaazing at creating tasty drinks.  The food is top notch as well. Open kitchen if you like to watch as well. :)"}
{"text":"One of the best Asian food restaurants I've ever been to! Everyone in my party loved it! Food was amazing but not many options that weren't duck or seafood so that was a little disappointing. But you can literally watch them cook the food in front of you!"}
{"text":"I went to Clever Kio on Saturday with my boyfriend. We sat at the bar. I ordered one of their cocktails called the Bees Knees which was a honey lavender gin drink, it was sooooo good I would highly recommend it. My boyfriend and I also got two different type of dumplings to share. He got pig face and I got the chicken ricotta they were both amazing. We also got some steamed buns that were really good. The staff was super friendly including one of the owners who was serving us our drinks behind the bar, Josh. Overall a great experience. Glad my boyfriend went there."}
{"text":"Nice ambient, but don't recall the food as being spectacular. The drinks were delicious, special creations. Nice outdoor patio area."}
{"text":"We just had a wonderful dinner and so enjoyed the ambience of this great restaurant. The food was delicious , the music was great but the best part was the staff, they were not only helpful but we got the feeling that they loved being there, a rare and amazing thing. Now the food , had the pork dumplings, yum! Then the Brussels sprouts , oh boy ! Followed up with kimchi rice, just a perfect dinner. We can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"My two cocktails were excellent (a berry vodka original and a retro whisky sour), service friendly, patio comfortable.  But the food perplexes us.  Billed as a fusion, we ordered pad thai and a duck curry.  The pad thai was swimming (drowning?) in a very thai peanut sauce, which i like but it was neither a fusion dish (e.g. with Korean influence) nor what i expected -- a drier noodle based pad thai.  The duck curry was more traditional coconut curry and the duck meat was tasty.   However, the kitchen's choice of udon noodles in the curry in lieu of rice was a poor one, turning it into a soup.  I must commend the restaurant for its excellent home made sriracha sauces and an out of this world beignet dessert.  If i am in Phoenix again I might go back and give it another try.  But..."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service (Thanks, Mike!). I recommend the soft shell crab and the catfish tempura steam buns."}
{"text":"I love this place! The ambiance is always happy and fun. I have tried a few things on the menu by my favorite is the Duck curry, it's full of flavor and the perfect amount of spice. The service is great and the owners always walk around and talk to you. It's a great place for a dinner for 2-4 people. During the day if it's warm enough the patio is a great place to hang out and eat."}
{"text":"I am not a resident of Phoenix, so I found this wonderful Asian fusion place from Yelp. We went for lunch, can't wait to come back for happy hour & dinner!

First I want to start with the service. It was incredible. Greeted and seated by one of the owners. He was super kind and very welcoming. No wait, and got seated as we walked in. Our server was sweet and she had great drink recommendations. 

I ordered the cold green tea noodle bowl. I added egg, ginger, kimchi, sprouts, mushrooms & tofu. The house made Sriracha sauce was good, but I could have enjoyed more heat (but I'm a weirdo that likes to be in pain when I eat spicy food). My grandmother ordered the udon bowl with chicken broth and shrimp and veggies. They were super accommodating to my grandmother and over cooked her veggies she she could eat without making her uncomfortable. Her only complaint it wasn't salty enough. LOL. (I tasted her broth and thought it was fine)  We also ordered the seasonal corn dumpling, not sure of the exact name but they were awesome. Finally, I ordered a Poloma to drink. House made grapefruit juice & lemongrass soda with tequila and lime. I could seriously drink like 10. 

Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll definitely be back. YUM."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with the inside (small and uncomfortable) or the take out (not as much flavor as I'd hoped). I think this is one of those places where you either love it or you go to back to your usual Vietnamese and Thai restaurants that have much more flavor!"}
{"text":"This place really stands out in Central Phoenix for its levels of culinary inventiveness and execution. I had Kimchi Johnnycakes (that wasn't what they were actually called) last night that were stratospherically awesome. My friend had a noodle dish in some kind of corn miso butter broth, with beautifully marinated cherry tomatoes, that was equally mind blowing.  Emily served us and she was fantastic, recommending great things when we asked. Cocktails expertly mixed. My third time here, and I'll be back again. For those complaining, what are they comparing this place to? Yelp reviews often reveal more about the reviewers than the restaurant. Gotta read between the lines! This place is really great, worth checking out for damn sure."}
{"text":"This Asian fusion restaurant has created quite a buzz with their steamed buns and happy hour menu. The frontal open patio can be a great place for hanging out and people watching during the not-so-hot seasons. By extension, the modern, immaculate interior encompasses large see-through glass windows, full bar, rows of tables, and touches of Asian artifacts. The atmosphere is completely hipsterish. Fellow Yelper Tony Y. Jr was in town for a visit, so we stopped by for happy hour and a light meal.

The Roasted Pork Belly Steamed Bun ($4.50) was served with hoisin, cilantro, and peanuts. The soft and fluffy steamed buns were addictive, but they were also pre-packaged and not made from scratch. The pork belly was tasty, but could be steeped in seasoning and roasted for a longer period of time. The touches of sauce and garnishes added some depth. It was a decent option, but the taste of the pork belly has to be more striking than it appeared. 

The Peking Duck Steamed Bun ($4.50) was put together with bacon, mizuna, and charred plum jam. The dry spots on the duck tasted oven baked with confit-like textures. The depth of seasoning was lacking the deep star anise flavors. The sauce and garnishes gave a nice savory and sweet contrast. Again, the duck should be a lot more robust and flavorful to add twists to the soft fluffy buns.

The Pork Ramen ($7) comes with braised pork belly, ribs, scallion, mustard green, kimchi, hearts of palm, and poached egg. They recently raised the happy hour prices but should really kept it at $5. The pork belly had a good fatty to meat ratio, but the broth was steeped with mustard green flavor that prevented the pork fat and shoyu to anchor the chewy egg noodles. The runny poached egg was a Western cop out on what is supposed to be soft-boiled egg. For what it is worth, I would only pay $5 for it. 

I've been here on many other occasions and service was attentive on most of my visits. I didn't get to review their other menu items, but there was overall a breadth of originality that did not translate into the kinds of sharp flavors, depth, refinement, and wow factors expected in the execution. 2.5 stars, I will only return when I'm invited to come hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Great service.  Fabulous atmosphere and the food is fresh and yummy!  Highly recommend.  I wish I had found this terrific place earlier.  I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service and a wonderful happy hour. I have been in a few times with friend and always had a great time. The location is adorable and the staff is always well dressed, attractive & very nice. Love how you can see into the kitchen, makes the dining experience that much more fun. Cannot wait to continue to come back. Plus.. Any menu with a wild amount of kimchee options is perfection in my eyes."}
{"text":"So I have only recently started posting to Yelp. I was actually here a couple of weeks ago, and if I may borrow from Mel B, this place is \"Off The Chain\". OMG, the total experience was amazing. The wait staff were knowledgeable, super friendly, and extremely helpful. The food, I had the XO noodles and Bulgogi chicken wings. I must say, some of the best food EVER!!  I tend to be more of a beer and tequila kinda guy, but I told the Mixologist what I like and don't, and he came up some seriously tasty concoctions. Wish I could remember the names (lol). Anyway, great ambience, fantastic serve staff, and awesome food!!"}
{"text":"It was our last night in Phoenix and this restaurant was the perfect place to go to. There was plenty of parking when we first arrived. We were greeted and sat right away. Decklin was our server (apologies if I completely butchered that) lol however they gave us great recommendations and had an amazing attitude, even with us showing up an hour before closing. I ordered the hot pot soup, the udon, seafood and broth was delicious. My girlfriend ordered Pad Thai, very flavorful and the right amount of portions. We also checked in and got free  pork belly and soft shell crab! I'm craving them til this day. We also bought their in-house hot sauce to take back to San Diego. Definitely go!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaraunts in PHX. The food is wildly amazing, the drinks are off the hook and the service is always exceptional. The owners are hands on and always walking around making sure everyone is well taken care of. The house made Green and Red Sriracha is awesome and you can buy it by the bottle to take home. I was glad I asked if they would sell me some.

Check this place out you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Pork ramen was delicious, broth very flavorful! Kimchi added a little spice but just enough, the pork was crispy on the outside and soft and juicy in the middle very well cooked though, overall really good bowl of ramen!"}
{"text":"There was a phase in my life where I came here basically every week, because I've never had ramen like what I found at Clever Koi.

Whenever I tell my friends that there's a place where I'm willing to pay $13 for a bowl of ramen, I get weird looks. 

Probably because they think I'm talking about the twenty-five cent college stuff. 

But no--this is a large bowl of pork broth with pork belly (I swear, it's just giant chunks of bacon. Don't be scared of the word \"belly\"), amazingly boiled noodles, a soft boiled egg, spices, crunchy veggies and deliciousness. 

And don't get me started on their chicken and waffle steam buns. Or their pork belly steam buns. Or their rotation of tap beers. Or the steaming seafood hot pot. Literally ALL of it is delicious.

If you're looking for somewhere to go on a date night, or for happy hour, or lunch--look no further. Go to Clever Koi and understand what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to dine. Originally went to the downtown Phoenix location. Pig face dumplings, duck croquettes, bao bun are all must haves!!! Lost one star because my favourite entree; the duck curry, is just too spicy. I've gotten it many times but I always need to take a break halfway through coz my whole GI track is on fire. I asked to adjust the spiciness but they couldn't."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Just went in for first time and had a sampler of just about everything. Pork belly ramen was the best ramen soup I've ever had. Broth was nice and salty yet palatable. Also enjoyed the wings, meat just fell right off the bone. Will definitely return for some more ramen and other items I didn't get to try. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Pork belly, is amazing here, atmosphere is pretty cool too! Great for a quick happy hour cocktail."}
{"text":"From the time we walked in until we left I was 100% impressed. The simple yet broad lunch menu was perfect for a casual Friday lunch. My guest had never explored this type of menu and David gave him a proper tour. 

Cheers to an amazing spot that I will be returning to!"}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for awhile and was super excited to try this place out! 

Walking in, the ambiance is great and I immediately thought about how the place is perfect for a date night, especially because of their long, craft cocktail list. 

My date and I ordered steamed buns, dumplings and kimchi fried rice. My date and I were not really impressed with any of the food, which I was shocked by. We are both a huge fan of Asian and this place had great reviews. Maybe we just ordered the wrong stuff? I do have to say, the pork belly steamed buns really saved the night, it was as good as some of the ones I ate in China! 


I am not in a rush to come back, but definitely would."}
{"text":"Great food and cool atmosphere. Would recommend. Still haven't tried the ramen dishes. On our list."}
{"text":"Okay honestly I didn't think I'd be able to post this review because I'm in a sublime food coma. 
I have been eyeing Clever Koi for months and avoiding it due to my assumption of it being a mecca for pretentious concoctions and over hyped ambience. The atmosphere was great. The service was excellent (get seated in Natalie's section if you can she was awesome). The pork buns are SO GOOD. I hate seeing pork belly on menus because it's always chewy and gross but damn these guys did it right. Chow mein was fresh and yummy. The only thing I wasnt impressed by was the pork dumplings/their kimchi was a little weak but I will definitely be back to spend my whole paycheck on their cocktail menu. They should rent livers so I can effectively try every drink they have. Cant wait to come back. I think we found our new happy hour spot."}
{"text":"A great place for happy hour.  The cocktails are sophisticated and well balanced (not too sweet). I love the design of the restaurant and decor. The food tastes like it was prepared with care."}
{"text":"We went to visit Clever Koi for the first time this Saturday. We were sat on the patio and although it was a bit chilly it was nice that they had heaters. Our bill came out to about 160.00 which we wouldn't have minded had the service  been good. Our waitress ( can't remember the name but she had red hair) was super friendly and probably the only reason this place is getting 2 stars. She was knowledgeable and looked like she was not supported by any staff. My friend ordered a Jack and Coke and it it came out as a different drink. It took about 20 minutes for him to get a simple drink. We had a more complicated drink and we got ours pretty fast. We ordered pork belly buns and chicken & waffles and my husband said his chicken and waffles were cold when it came out. 

Our food  took almost two hours to come out!!!! The waitress explained several times that the kitchen was backed up. While we waited the two hours, the outside heaters went out so we were waiting out in the cold for our food. Which the waitress ended up getting fixed on her own while her other tables awaited. I ordered a spicy seafood soup which was good but I am not sure if it was so good because I was so hungry. This place probably would be better if they had more support both front and back of the house."}
{"text":"So I have to drop a star from my previous rating, as consistency is key to me. Because I loved the shaking beef so much the first time I was here, I brought another group with me to try the restaurant out. To my disappointment, the shaking beef was NOT the same. The first time it was perfectly seared with a firm, crunchy texture and this past visit, it was lacking that same texture...a bit on the mushy side for me. I'm not certain which way is correct, but needless to say, I didn't clean my plate. :(

We had another guest at the table order the fried rice, only to find out that during our particular visit they decided to use fish sauce in lieu of the soy sauce - they weren't a fan of the revised version. I will go back again, hoping that the consistency is there."}
{"text":"Completely unique and worth the trip. My wife and I traveled to phoenix for a weekend get away and were lucky enough to have a small gift card that brought us into the Clever Koi. We arrived after golf for happy hour and were fortunate enough to have an amazing server who recommended to try the steam buns and the dumplings. Do not leave without trying the roasted pork belly and soft shell crab steam buns! For drinks my wife had a Phil Collins and I had an Enabler, both were delicious and unique and I highly recommend trying them.

The Clever Koi was delicious, unique and a great place to spend a happy hour."}
{"text":"We decided to go back to Clever Koi tonight and try again!!! We had a great time! Enjoyed the drinks, food and environment! We will be back and are happy to know it's a good place for us to enjoy family dinner!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night with a few friends of mine around 6:30. When I first walked in I noticed the modern, cool decor and ambiance with dimmed lighting. There was about a 20 minute wait, which wasn't so bad considering the place was pretty small and dinner time on a Friday night. We grabbed a couple Japanese dark stout beers which were awesome while waiting to be seated. 
We ordered pork belly steam buns, chicken and waffle steam buns, and Kung pao wings, and scallop dumplings for appetizers. The pork belly steam buns were delicious. The pork was tender and full of flavor while the buns were nice and fluffy. The chicken and waffle steam buns were pretty good but would've been better with a little more sauce. In my opinion the yuzu ponzu that came on the side with the steam buns do not belong with that dish. The scallop dumplings were a little flavorless and the sauce tasted a little bland and just didn't mesh well in my option. 
For our entrees we ordered Pad Thai, pork belly ramen, seafood hot pot, and beef and broccolini, and a side of pork belly. 
The pad Thai tasted like instant version of noodles, the seafood hot pot could've been better but I think the sour lime flavor over powered any natural seafood flavor and spice that it could've had, the beef and broccolini had a good flavor but a little on the salty side, and at the least I enjoyed the pork belly ramen. The noodles had a Perect chewy texture (not soggy) and the kimchi and pork belly and boiled egg really meshed together well with the miso butter broth. The server had forgotten our Kung pao wings and the side of pork belly so we reminded her twice and they came out at the end. The wings were bland, nothing special about them. 
Being an Asian American having tried and knowing what the authentic way these dishes are supposed to taste kind of disappoints my palate. All in all this place serves an Americanized version of Asian fusion cuisine. Ticket times were slow, service was eh, the most of the food was mediocre but the beer, pork steam buns and pork belly ramen were delicious. 
I noticed they have happy hour until 6 pm, Maybe I'll come back to try that out, but in my opinion it's not worth spending 130 dollars on."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Duck curry, seafood hot pot, pig face dumplings!!!! Uhh, literally heaven."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Thank you Mike for being such an amazing server! I HIGHLY recommend the \"up in smoke\" drink! Amazing food and amazing drinks, with amazing service, CAN NOT WAIT to come back again ASAP!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently great. Love the simplicity of the menu at lunch, and the flavor from each bowl I have ordered. Today was the ramen with chicken broth, sprouts, Bok choy, lemongrass chicken, mushroom and egg. The broth alone is worth it. Packed full of flavor and thankfully they give you a soup spoon so you can savor every last drop. Also try the grapefruit lemongrass soda if they have it (flavor changes). Service is prompt and these guys really have mastered the art of ramen bowls. One of my go-to spots for sure! I will update my review when I make it here for dinner fare."}
{"text":"Our waitress was the best- she was attentive, knowledgeable and super patient: 5.  The atmosphere is trendy and modern: 5.  Parking is easy and free: 5. The food was hit or miss: 3.  Went with a party- the soups (ramen, udon, and something else) were like a 2-3. Tried all the baos - the pork belly bao saved it. My friend also said the beef noodle dish was pretty good."}
{"text":"My friends all told me this place rocked but reading the menu put me off a little (not being super adventurous when it comes to Nuevo-anything, especially farm to table healthy crap). Well, I was wrong. 

This place is amazing. Crazy amazing. 

We had the black rice and happy hour \"spicy noodles\" and they rocked my world. (Please don't tell the chicken tender me...)

They have an awesome happy hour and make a killer Boulevardier. 

Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"I love The Clever Koi.  They have a killer lunch special - a $5.00 bowl of ramen.  After putting all the fancy stuff in it (meat, egg, bok choi, etc) - it comes out to a still-acceptable 10 or 11 bucks. Delicious. Also, the pork belly bun is also excellent.

Every time we've been there, we were greeted warmly by the owner and had good service at the bar. The bartenders are also excellent there. I really like the French 95(?) cocktail - a mix of champagne and whiskey. Weird but mighty good.  They have a good discount on cocktails at happy hour, too.  

Hands down, the Clever Koi is great stuff. I go there as often as I can!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for girls night and I'm glad I came before they changed their menu. 

We sat at the bar and Jackson was our server. Jackson was super funny, knowledgable, and made our experience at The Clever Koi unforgettable! We both got a drink called 'The Fuzzy Things' that will be on the new menu. It was light, refreshing, and not too sweet! Plus, it came with a mermaid. The Scorpion bowl looks awesome too! When I come back, I will try that. 

With regard to food, we ordered the soft shell crab, pork belly and soft shell crab steamed buns, pig face and rabbit dumplings, and the duck fat siracha wings. Food coma central, lol. 

Everything was delightful! My favorite dish of the night was the soft shell crab, but I loved it all. I will say one thing though, the rabbit dumplings were a bit too greasy for my taste, but it was still good. 

Overall, the customer service, the ambiance, and the food was a perfect 5/5. I will also mention one last thing that I found to be rare and honestly, respectful and admirable; the owners work on the floor, behind the bar, and in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Finding vegetarian options isn't as difficult as it once was but finding delicious vegetarian eats is still hard. This place hit the mark and I want more."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place- it's ramen and it's not too pretentious, but at the end of the day, the food is not good and the service is just as bad.

Food:
I had the pork broth with pork belly. The broth was insanely unflavorful, and the housemade sriracha did not help ( i honestly would have preferred green lid sriracha. Just because it's house made does not mean that it's good.) The noodles were decent, but without a good broth, it had me reminiscing about the days I liked to eat spaghetti with just butter and salt--- and a little bit of nostalgia is not always a good thing. The pork belly was fried which was unusual to me, and they over cooked it so much it was embarrassing for me to eat (I gnawed on it when i took the first bite because I didn't realize how chewy it would be). Not even my fork and knife could salvage it.

Service:
The service was average. The servers were apathetic and we had 3 or 4 waiters that all seemed lost and confused.

Again, it's a cute place that I wish I could love, but having had loads of Ramen before, if the broth isn't good, then I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Best Asian fusion restaurant I've tried so far. The service was great, the pork was amazingly tender and juicy and it's well worth your while to save room for the banana fritters. The restaurant isn't too big but the quaint space makes it feel more inviting. They accept reservations and they offer complimentary valet parking."}
{"text":"So to start off we had a good experience but my friend had a little GI distress after her meal maybe because of the spices in the Ramen.  I had the the Duck Udon which was good but for the portion and price seemed a bit more to crave to eat.  I'll be back for another round.  I've been here before for the tapas style selection along with the cocktails which were fabulous but I wanted to see if there was any change since the last time I had visited."}
{"text":"This place was trendy and fun environment! They close a little later then all the other places on the black so nice for a dinner date. The food has a nice flair to set it apart from standard Asian. Will be back :) yum!"}
{"text":"Not great. 1st time was amazing.  Short staffed, food was average and overall very disappointed. Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I should start by saying that Clever Koi (Phoenix or Gilbert) is my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area. I came here so many times already and honestly there were ups and downs but the food is always on point. It's delicious, it's tasty, it's unique, it's fusion! I love that they change their menu too so it allows you to actually try new things. We usually go there during happy hour, every day from 11pm-6pm! Their craft cocktails are $8, it's so worth it. Right now, my all time favorite is their Pork Belly Steamed Bun, it's just AMAZING. The pork is so tender and tasty that it almost taste like duck, you should seriously try it! 
Anyway, we will be back, again and again. 
We do have a soft spot for the Phoenix location .. but shhhh its a secret!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a whim. Sat at the counter. Food was excellent! So many yummy things to choose from that I can't wait to go back! Had the seafood hot pot that was so full of flavor. Fish was so fresh, not overdone from sitting in the broth. Was fun watching cooks work to create dishes. Seemed attentive to detail and presentation."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Loved the entire meal we had to include excellent pairing with cocktails and wine.."}
{"text":"If you don't eat here...you need your head examined. I seriously think I touched a little slice of heaven as I shoved the fork in my mouth...over and over and over again. I wish I had a bigger stomach so I could keep ordering, and eating. Its so delicious, and I want to go back every single day...and sadly, tomorrow is Sunday, and they are closed. I guess if they bring you to Heaven, they also deserve a day of rest. Amen! 
EAT HERE, I PROMISE, You Will Love It."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since opening day and have never had a bad experience. The food is always creative and fresh...if you are a fan of Asian influenced fare and of course noodles you will love this place. Try the kimchi and the house-made Sriracha is the bomb! Service is attentive and the bar is always top shelf. Very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"From the minute you walk in you are greeted with a friendly welcome. The wait staff is superb and the food is outstanding. Let's not forget the bar, the drink menu is original and will cater to your every whim."}
{"text":"Well-balanced cocktails like the Dark & Stormy (more ginger than sweet) and the Old Fashioned. Happy Hour menu includes lovely pork ramen and wood fired grill plate with 2 sauces. House made sriracha. Attentive service."}
{"text":"After much anticipation my husband and I finally tried out the Clever Koi. We had a dinner reservation (which I highly recommend) but we went early to order a couple cocktails and an appetizer during their happy hour. 

Cocktails were exquisite. I had the Bees Knees. A gin concoction with lemon, honey, and lavender. It was so smooth and delicious, even my husband who normally hate gin thought it was good. We also had edamame fritters which were very good and paired nicely with our cocktails. 

For dinner I had the summer corn ramen and my husband had the Mongolian beef. The hubs was blown away by his dish. He said the steak was cooked perfectly and everything was flavorful. He raved about it for days. I thought my ramen was very good. It had a very light and creamy broth. I prefer spicier dishes and luckily they had a bottle of sriricha on the table. I will try something a little bolder next time. However I work close by and I can totally see myself ordering this for lunch when I'm feeling under the weather and need something comforting. 

The service all around was great, from the friendly host who seems to go above and beyond for guests to the easygoing bartenders to our informative server. Although the restaurant was super busy, the staff never seemed to lose their cool and remained friendly and eager to please. We will be back."}
{"text":"I went with a friend and got the kung pao chicken wings ($5 happy hour from 3-6 daily), pork ramen, lemon pepper chicken ramen, and two steamed buns with pork belly. The only negative thing I would have to say about Clever Koi is that the steamed buns were $4 each and they aren't very big. I honestly thought it was worth it though, because the crunchy top of the pork belly mixed with the delicious flavor of the sauce and meat were the perfect combination. The pork ramen was a steal from the happy hour menu as well for only $8 as opposed to $13.50. The broth was incredibly flavorful, but I wasn't a huge fan of the kimchi.  I thought the other ramen dish was also a 5 star, as the chicken was crunchy throughout the whole meal and the broth was nice and light. I was surprised when we weren't overly stuffed after, but I would still recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants to try some new exotic flavors and is okay with spending a little extra money. The service was very fast and friendly and the atmosphere was enjoyable. All in all, I love Clever Koi and I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"First visit n had no idea the lunch menu was significantly scaled down from the dinner menu .. It's basically ramen, chow mein or a few apps (4) to be exact. Tried the ramen w chkn broth, tofu, broccoli, mushrooms , egg n kimchi. The seasoning in the broth was weak n that sets the tone for ramen; the kimchi was good but the tofu slightly burnt (grilled) n other veg wasn't memorable. Started w the black bean n celery root pancakes n honestly those were legit real tasty! Waiter was also friendly but def disappointed in the ramen. On the fence about returning ..."}
{"text":"This newer restaurant is in a nicely gentrified area of Central Phoenix with upscale apartments nearby. It serves Asian food and comes across not as an authentic Asian restaurant but as a trendy place with a sophisticated ambiance. We had noodle dishes with okay portions and somewhat good taste, different in style but not exotic. Price was a tad high for the area but not really bad. We enjoyed our time there but not enough to return in the future, as there are many very authentic Asian places in this city."}
{"text":"The patio is perfection. The chopped salad was very very very good. The steamed buns are 100% worth it. We only tried one I suggest all 3 in fact i would try all 3 and pass on the dumplings unless you have a huge appetite in which case do both but if you have to pick I'd do buns over dumplings. The ramen is very popular. It's not my cup of tea so I can't say it was to die for but the pork belly one is their most popular so we got it and it was fine but again not something I'm that in to so it tasted good but I wish we would have gotten the pad Thai with shrimp personally. Another thing I didn't get to try and wish I would have is the kimchi fried rice. Definitely will do that next time. And then their dessert menu only has 2 items there is a butter cake which wasn't worth it and then beignets which I didn't have but would try next time as well."}
{"text":"The food is a sampling of Asia from Korea to Vietnam and it's all excellent. Also everyone who works here is high, so the food takes a while but on the bright side they'll forget to charge you for beers while you wait."}
{"text":"Asian food is not usually my first choice.. ever. But Clever Koi really surprised me! 
I enjoyed the restaurant itself, from the ambiance to the service, everything was impeccable. 
We came to try the drinks that we hear such rave reviews about so we weren't initially planning to order any food. The bar was full so we were seated at a table and asked our waitress for an appetizer suggestion. She lead us to choose the Chinese long beans, which I never would have picked on my own, and they were fabulous! Did I mention they come with duck tongue? It sounded weird to me at first but it was seriously delicious. We also decided to try the steamed buns; the lamb pastrami and onion ring were so flavorful. Oh, and the onion ring bun came with a sriracha sauce that made my night because I love spicy anything.
The drinks we ordered were the best drinks I think I've ever had. I tried the enabler and my friend ordered the reviver. Needless to say both of our drinks were so good we each had to have two. We could see the bartender actually making the drinks and taking his time crafting them, which I thought was a unique added touch. 

My only complaint is that I live in Tucson and wish it was closer so I could branch out more often. Here's hoping they open a location in Tucson!"}
{"text":"One of the reasons we couldn't give five stars is the price of the drinks- $9 for a well vodka water! The lemon chicken ramen was delicious! The seasonal veggie panang was good, but my personal preference would have had it with a little more sauce. The burrata appetizer was to die for! Our waiter recommended it to us and we would recommend it to anyone! The banana fritter dessert was really good too- different but tasty! The martinis were very well made but as mentioned, pricey. Cool atmosphere and attentive service."}
{"text":"Nice patio for al fresco dining.  Shared a couple of appetizers with a friend.  The first was the tuna poke chips that have great flavor; loved the rice chips.  The second was the wings.  Again great flavor.  Lots of cocktails on happy hour special; I got the French 95 because I like bourbon."}
{"text":"First, at 12:30pm, there wasn't a lunch rush. It was busy, but it didn't have that screaming busy hustle that some restaurants get for lunch. I could hear my friend talk and the wait staff was relaxed. Next, parking. There's parking and it's easy and there was plenty of it. Third, you cannot beat build your own ramen. I got the pork broth with tofu (weird I know, I just like it), mushrooms (which were shiitakes, not just button mushrooms), a soft boiled egg, bean sprouts and kim chi. Holy moly! My friend did nearly they identical thing, only she got pork belly and some bamboo too. We didn't talk for a while. The egg was perfect. But my fav was the kim chi. I needed some to munch on as I was eating my ramen. The owner/manager/someone important came over and brought me extra kim chi to take home on top of my side! Like \"we don't see people that love kim chi as much as you; please have some more!\" Tomorrow, kim chi friend rice. I'm going back, for sure! Great service, great food. I'm really curious what happy hour is like."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I get the Enabler. Every single time it has been just as delicious, lemony, burnt sugary, tart, whisky boozy, and satisfying as before. This might be the best drink in Phoenix...maybe even the world.

All the food I've ever tried here has been brilliant and delicious. The Tuna Chips and the Short Rib Dumplings are two that I remember the most. The service is always fun and professional. These folks are really proud of what they do and it shows."}
{"text":"It was my last night in Phoenix and I asked my best friend to pick me a restaurant where I could have a unique and incredible experience. I was amazed at his ability to pick'em! His response was to go to The Clever Koi, and try to make it before happy hour was over at 6pm. By the time I walked in it was 6:01pm. I was instantly amazed by the atmosphere. it was very warm and welcoming. I was greeted by the hostess and immediately sat at the bar so I could still put in my order for happy hour special. The bar tender was one of the owners, and took my drink order. Which was made by a very good female bartender. It was refreshing and just what i needed. I also got dumplings, and the Koi Burger. I don't know how they made them, nor what they put in them, but this dumplings were just incredible! So delicious that I was so close to getting another order. In the end it was a good thing i didn't. Once I got the burger, I was wowed and in heaven. It was big, it was juicy, and boy was it tasty! damn best burger I have ever had! Even just writing about it now is making me crave another one. How I wish the owners would open up a business in Las Vegas. This is definitely the place to go and try out. I can not see anything on their menu tasting bad. All in all it truly was an incredible experience. Worth every bite and every penny. The owners are down to earth, fun and very welcoming. Thank you for a great night."}
{"text":"Start off with a steamed bun and dumplings.finish off with some Legit Ramen. And there is dessert too!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and tasty. We went for happy hour and had the long beans and pork belly (omg) the ahi chips (addicting) the duck wings (crispy and yummy) and the po boy (try the green sricha).  Wine was cold. Zach was attentive and helpful. Nice job Zach. 
Will be back"}
{"text":"Hipster alert.  Trust me we can appreciate the craft of bartending.  But when did it become acceptable to act like a pompous ass Behind the bar.  Dude, you are a bartender!!!   We rolled in for a drink and tried some appetizers.  The food was atrocious. I mean really bad.  We took three bites of each and told the bartender we were done.  My wife's drink was actually decent.  Pretty good actually but I don't have the time to goto a place where the guys behind the bar think they are better than everyone else.  Suggestion:  focus on service and show a little humility.  Could be a great place but our group is going to let y'all get a bit better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go eat. Ive been there couple of times with work folks for lunch and with the fam for lunch as well. 
They have really good service and the food is always fresh and tastes amazing. 
Some of the best food i've had in Phoenix"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here on a Monday night and took advantage of the \"It Takes Two\" special. For $35 we got two bowls of ramen and four beers... do the math, THEY basically paid US to drink an extra beer each! My wife ordered the pork ramen and I had the crispy lemon chicken ramen, and neither of us could decide which one we liked better, they're THAT good. One thing we both agreed on was that the spicy chicken and waffle bun we ordered as an appetizer was amazing! I seriously could have ordered a few more and called it a night with just the buns. But do yourself a favor and save room for some ramen!

Five stars for the ambiance and great service as well. I love how everyone works together as a team. We had at least 4-5 different staff members taking care of us during our meal. This resulted in quick and efficient service and a flawless dining experience! We will be back soon without a doubt."}
{"text":"We like to try out new restaurants so I was excited for this one! Coming from California, I was extremely excited to have a good ramen place nearby. Great selection of food on the menu, but there was something about the flavor that was lacking. We have ordered the Pork Belly ramen, Crispy Duck Pineapple Rice and the Spicy seafood soup. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and come back another time, maybe it was just an off night for the chef."}
{"text":"This was one of those strange dining experiences.   You find a restaurant with lots of good reviews, go there with high hopes, try many things from the menu, and be surprised to find that none of the dishes are that good.   The Sriracha chicken wing was so tiny and totally lacking any kick or flavor.   Pork belly and soft shell crab buns were the most decent items in our meal, but still nothing to write home about.    The major disappointment was our main dishes.   My wife had Crispy Pineapple Duck which was so dry and hard.   I had Tamarind Mole Short Rib and I must say it was the most flavorless short rib I ever had.   Their menu looks creative and we thought our taste buds will be in for a great treat, but there was none of that...."}
{"text":"Asian fusion at its best! Dumplings, sweet buns and the tuna chips were amazing. My favorite dumpling was the pork belly, so smokey, so tender! The corn fritter dumplings were a must have! Speciality cocktails out the wazoo! I feel like you cant go wrong on this menu! Great ambiance too boot!"}
{"text":"Finally experienced The Clever Koi!
Parking was simple, I just let the valet take care of it (free valet, just tip the poor guy).
The atmosphere was super hipster, what do you expect it's downtown Phoenix. I was loving every second of the music - all my current faves like Flume and Chet Faker.
My drink was so tasty! I even had to tweet them about it when I left! Yes, I HAD to. They have a drink option called \"Hey Bartender!\" where you pick your liquor or any flavors you want and the bartender makes something up for you. This works perfectly for dorks like me who can never just pick something and don't necessarily have a go-to. I asked for gin and the waiter looked challengingly at me like \"...you sure that's it?\" so I said something with citrus flavors. YUM! I forgot to ask what it was exactly but it tasted light, sparkling, citrusy, hands down the perfect summer cocktail. 

To start my Dad and I each had one of the steamed buns. I had duck, he had pork. Both were delicious and flavorful. My pork ramen surprised me because I didn't realize the pork would have the bones in it, maybe I was supposed to know that but I didn't and it freaked me out just a bit (that's my own thing). Other than that I enjoyed my dish, though it was a bit salty I think that's probably to be expected with a broth. It wasn't the best ramen I've ever had, but I would eat it again. I might try the veggie one next time. I think I would like to come back for happy hour and just order a bunch of the steamed buns and some of the appetizers. 

The service was friendly and attentive. Who I assumed was the manager came by to check on us, as well as our server. The server was quick to make recommendations and tell us about his favorite items. He seemed knowledgeable about the menu, which I always think is important. The patio looked like it had some high tech spinning mister system, so it might not be too bad to sit out there in these summer months. Also, I thought the price points were very reasonable."}
{"text":"unfortunately this place is not for the food. it's for the fun hip vibe and spot to see and be seen.
with the proximity to light rail, it's the much-needed more upscale option to G&D at the Indian School stop. unfortunately it doesn't have the history or the camp yet to be OK with just mediocre food. 2 stars.

* great happy hour drinks and nice takes on classic drinks
* excellent selection of liquor, anything which might tickle your general fancy

But
THERE'S A REASON IT CAN BE SERVED FOR $5.
### sriracha kimchi chicken wings. epic fail. there's a reason i call it \"stuff-me-full-of-antibiotics-so-i-don't-die-while-i'm-standing-in-my-own-shit-while-i-wait-for-the-growth-hormones-to-make-me-bigger-than-i-ever-was-supposed-to-be feed lot meat\".
It's slimy, it's fatty, it's huge and somehow wrong. and it bites like a sponge.
mild kimchi and spicy wing sauce interests but one bite of that chicken and it's going back. BLECH.

## pork belly ramen.
#chewy pork belly reminds me of chicharron and not in a good way.
# noodles are undercooked and the whole thing is just boring and bland. you could say it was \"mild\" but, no. ramen should be bursting with umami that makes your tongue swell up.
# \"soft\" egg just more bore. no salt anywhere, not even at the table.

-- Kung Pao chicken.
meh. with brown rice it was hearty, but just boring.

what a waste."}
{"text":"Tonight would have been my first time at Clever Koi. But, too bad they failed to let anyone know their kitchen closes at 10. The hours listed say they close at 11. After standing at the hostess desk for an uncomfortably long time a women informs us that we cannot be seen. Why would something like this not be common knowledge?! What a bummer."}
{"text":"Excellent food, drinks, service and atmosphere. Cool without being pretentious. The duck curry ramen was incredible, and filling; my boyfriend and I shared it. We also shared the steam buns, tried all three. The crab was the best, but all were interesting and delicious. The drinks were made REALLY REALLY well, with amazing selection of fresh fruit, homemade mixers great selection. The owner was approachable and just really very nice."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Had the Ramen Ramen bowl w pork.  It was delicious.  Waiter was super helpful with suggestions.   Been several times and it always great."}
{"text":"Good but not what I expected. Been to the one on Central for lunch and really enjoyed it. Was happy to see one going in near my home so checked it out the other day. Found it is not open for lunch! What? The lunch menu rocks! Not a big fan on the dinner menu. Oh well."}
{"text":"There is never a bad thing at Clever Koi or a bad time to go. I love the Build Your Own Ramen Bowl Lunch. It's pretty traditional with some flavorful twists like using duck. They make their own Kimchi. Get the chicken and waffle bun or the spam bun...or both. Their cocktail program is surprisingly creative and on par with any in the valley."}
{"text":"We decided to drive to downtown Phoenix for a taste of something new and The Clever Koi looked like a great place. Great atmosphere from the moment you walk in. We were greeted immediately and seated. The brunch menu was basically a create your own ramen  etc with a few appetizers. To be honest this isn't really what we had in mind, but decided to give it a try. I'm glad we did. The food was great. I had ramen with, shrimp, pork broth, sprouts,carrots and snow peas. We also ordered the pig face dumplings which were spicy and amazing. The reason why I'm only rating a four star is for service. Our waitress really seemed bored and uninterested. It was slow since we were there around three and felt more of a bother than a customer. A smile and a little more acknowledgement, drink refills would have made it five star fire sure,"}
{"text":"Let us start with this...  Is Clever Koi more expensive than the average Gilbert Restaurant? Yes
Does it suck having to drive through DT Gilbert traffic to get here? Yes,     But is it worth the money and hassle? YES    Please go here and eat some tuna chips and a pork belly steam bun. It's delish and don't forget to buy a bottle of their hot sauce. SO GOOD   TUNA CHIPS & PORK BELLY STEAM BUN   Your Welcome"}
{"text":"Love love their ramen. The flavor is amazing, the choices are great for the build your own. I've ordered the chow mein on Uber eats and it was good but not great. Maybe it would be better fresh at the restaurant rather than take out. Service can be patchy too, nothing terrible but slow even during lunch when the restaurant isn't busy. But given how delicious the ramen is, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not going to lie, this is one of the best ramen places (if not thee best) I've ever been to. After just moving from Los Angeles to the Phoenix area...I was so impressed with the ambiance of this restaurant. They have delicious drinks and an excellent lunch offering, but what really sold me was just how good the dang ramen was. I found myself craving it and wanting to come back the rest of this week. Be sure to try it out if your hanging out in Downtown Phoenix, and from what I heard...there will be a new location in Gilbert very soon! The hostess/waitress was also super helpful, attentive, and sweet. I ordered the Sour Times cocktail and it was like drinking a berry garden of goodness! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The food here is just amazing! Everything is prepared in such a unique high end way that you just  cant get anywhere else DT Gilbert! Cocktails are great too. Favs are the Pad Thai, Kimchi Burger, the Pork Belly Buns and Duck Wings! SO GOOD."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an excellent vibe, exceptional service and outstanding food!  This is the place!!! Love the happy hour!  The vegetable chow mein is delicious and the Edemame fritters are a must!!!"}
{"text":"This place was nicely decorated with both indoor and outdoor seating. The server was great, attentive, but not over your shoulder.  The ambiance was cozy with a flare of romance.  The restroom is unisex so all you sheltered people, be forewarned. The Pig Face Dumpling is terrific, very fresh, flavorful and has a zest.  If they added just a little less Sriracha, then it would be a 10.  Their seared Hamachi was on point.  I ordered my Hamachi med and it was light pink in the center with a crisp, seared taste. The dish itself needed more aesthetic appeal yet the bite was scrumptious and the mix veggies with the mango sauce was fabulous.  Skip the green tea pound cake, not too much bragging on that dessert."}
{"text":"We were recommended to this place by a couple of friends because my boyfriend and I were trying to find the best noodles in town... Safe to say we were not disappointed at all. We sat outside and ordered a round of drinks, I was in the mood for a piña colada but unfortunately they were out of an ingredient for it so the bartender said he could make me something else. The drink he brought had bourbon in it and I was not a fan, however I was going to try and drink it anyway. At the end of our dinner the server (I wish I could remember her name) noticed I didn't like the drink so she took it away and asked if she could try again and bring me something else I said sure! She came back with a drink I originally was thinking about getting and I was very happy with it. I really wish I could remember her name because she was very sweet and even offered to take a picture of my boyfriend and I. We'll definitely be back because everything was splendid!"}
{"text":"Remind me to order the Pork Belly Bun, over and over again. Order it in SPADES. Because everything else here is lackluster..."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and we have always throughly enjoyed our overall experience. Food is wonderful, drinks are to die for and the atmosphere is amazing. You can tell that a lot of thought went into every detail, down to the menu choices, to the presentation, even the silverware! It's beautiful! I always leave here wishing I could have a room in my home decorated like this place. Nice job. We always try something new and have loved absolutely everything we've tasted. We even brought our older kids here and they enjoyed trying some new flavors. Repeat visits are in our future. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Tasty drinks. Great service. Don't have much else to say except yelp wants me to be more verbal  . . ."}
{"text":"I like to research a restaurant before trying it and I was super excited to eat here. I went there tonight with my bf and all in all, I found it disappointing.

They cram the people in like sardines, with tables literally having maybe a foot in between one another. It was also incredibly loud. So much so that we had to ask our server repeatedly to reiterate what he was saying while also hearing the conversations, word for word, of everyone in a ten foot perimeter. How romantic.

Now to the food. 

I got the Kung Pao Wings and what I received was...odd. Here I was thinking they'd be like every other chicken wing that I've had at a restaurant. Nope. They serve you the ENTIRE wing: tip, joints, and all. So you get this big, awkward, boney wing with sticky sauce all over. So as I'm trying to figure out how to eat this thing, the sauce gets everywhere; only part of the wing itself is crispy and the other part is fatty and mushy, and overall it was the biggest letdown of the night. I love chicken wings and this was a big disappointment. Staff of Clever Koi: warn people when ordering this dish! My server saw my struggles but clearly did not care or try to make things easier. Thanks man.

Next I got the Pork Belly ramen and my bf got the broccolini and beef. The ramen was okay. In my opinion there were too many flavors trying to vie for attention and not all of them were good. The broccolini and beef was delicious, although there were maybe only 3 pieces of beef in the entire bowl. Being a foodie, I hate expecting good things from a restaurant only to be severely let down and out a good chunk of change. Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I don't know how to classify the food at Clever Koi... Chinese? Japanese? Dirty knees, look at these? I don't know... but what I do know is that what ever they're doing, they're doing it right. 

I first came to CK about a month ago and it nearly, instantaneously became one of my favorite restaurants in PHX.

The Food: 

The first thing that stood out were the Steamed Buns. I love steam buns and the ones here are very good. I think I've now tried all of them. The chicken and Waffle as well as the Duck stick out in my mind the most so I would say try those but none have disappointed. 

As far as entree's go, I've had the Sweet & Sour (Chicken?) Rice Bowl... I thought I had pork but the menu on their website says it's chicken so whateve's, either way it was delicious. 

The next time we came, I had the Mongolian Beef rice Bowl... I think the website menu is wrong because I don't see it on there but I know that's what I got because it was just last night. It was great but what sticks out in my mind is the thin slices of something... some kind of garnish perhaps, but either way this stuff was wriggling like they were alive... it was freaky and kind of cool at the same time. PS... it wasn't alive... 

The Dranks:

They make Great cocktails.... The first time I tried the Guns N Rose' because... yeah GNR is the greatest band ever... A nod to CK on the naming... ya got me. It was very good. Not something I'd drink all the time but good. 

I think the other drink I got was the Rye & Rum Old Fashioned... again, very good. I could have drank these all night long and then later made very questionable life choices.

They also have a very good craft beer selection. On my second visit I went with the THAT Brewery Road Rash IPA. I like when restaurants have local beer offerings and there were quite a few the night we went.

Let's Wrap it Up: 

I didn't mention above but the presentation of the food and drink are very nicely done. Attractive without feeling pretentious. I love that. It's a cool place... the atmosphere is very chill and the service has been excellent both times we've been here. 

All that said, I guess it doesn't really matter how you classify Clever Koi. At the end of the day, the only box they fit in for me is the box labeled awesome places to eat and drink in Phoenix. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Yum! Pork belly bow buns & chicken and waffles slider. Noodles were amazing too. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Every time I come in is better than the time before. This group of partners go out of their way to make customers feel appreciated and can do no wrong with food or cocktails. They recently added some new dishes and cocktails that are must try items including the Mai tai, Kung pao chicken wings, and roasted corn dumplings. My favorite place in central Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The service here is always AMAZING!! the food is delish... The drinks are creative and fun and the ambiance is awesome!! I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! From the food to the service to the ambiance. A great local spot to check out. The food is delish, but the drinks are better. We met one of the owners and fell even more in love with the place. They truly care about your dining experience. A must go to!"}
{"text":"Very innovative and creative menu. Wonderful cocktails. Great service (Brian). One of the owners (Nick) chatted with us at our table, offered us his personal favorites, and then later we saw him washing windows and cleaning the kitchen....thats what a real passionate owner does! Bravo sir!  The steamed buns are definitely worth trying, in fact, try them all. The Poutine was superb. The chef used to work at The Parlor when it was at its best so you know this guy knows how to cook. Another great addition to Phoenix dining."}
{"text":"By far, one of the best restaurants located on Central! The service was awesome. The staff answered every question our large party asked. We hardly had to wait for anything. The Cauliflower Ramen is the best I've ever had. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the vegetarian ramen and it was really good. Hard to find vegetarian ramen! My bf had the kimchi burger and says it was good. I can speak for the fries and they were amazing! Fun drinks and a decent happy hour as well! Not the best prices for happy hour but it goes all day!"}
{"text":"The food is ALWAYS excellent. Tonight we were very impressed by Decker! The service was exquisite and she even refolded the napkins if we stepped away from the table! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Second time there....better than the first.  Cocktails wonderful.  The soft crab steamed buns are great and the duck was interesting and exceptionally tasty.  Love this place!  And the Manager and Staff couldn't have been better.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came here again for a second time for another try and I had the best service possible. 

Travis, Nick, and Kenzie were all so attentive and extremely friendly to all of the customers. We were greeted and got to sit down anywhere we wanted. 

Our waitress was very talkative and sweet. Travis knew the differences and details of the drinks that we asked about and was very knowledgable and informative. 

The food we ended up ordering was the Pork Ramen, the Lemon Crispy Pepper Chicken Ramen (forget the name!), and the XO Yakisoba noodles. The food does NOT disappoint and is amazing and the portions were large. We all got to take home leftovers because none of us got to finish the dishes.

Overall I just had a amazing experience from every one that we encountered. The food was delicious as usual. 

This experience was great, I recommend this place to everyone. (I also recommend that crispy chicken ramen!)"}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  The dumplings and the wood fire grilled plate were both really good. And it's nice to find a restaurant with an asian inspired menu with really good cocktails. The ramen that people had around me looked and smelled awesome. I'll have that next time.  Give this place a shot."}
{"text":"My girlfriend told me about a great place to get ramen. I was super skeptical because I have tried ramen around the Phoenix area and have yet to be pleased. But I decided to take her PASSIONATE word for it and check out the Clever Koi. Let's just say I went twice in one week and have to keep myself from going every day. Not only was the pork ramen some of the best I've ever had, the ambiance makes for the perfect date night or girls night out, the cocktail list is fresh and unique AND the staff is full of good looking and super friendly guys. ( totally not trying to objectify the men that work there - okay - maybe I am just a little ). This is definitely my new favorite spot in the midtown area. AND I can walk to it from where I live. So I guess it's okay if I visit a few times a week if I'm walking off the calories, right? LOVE this spot."}
{"text":"Holy ramen!!! 
This place was amazing from start to finish. 
Please do yourself a favor and go check it out. 
Definitely get the pig face dumping as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Decided to go out of my comfort zone of Mexican food and Italian and bring our family to Clever Koi for out anniversary tonight.  I was so nervous because my husband is a Sous Chef and our friends and kids are super picky. I have to say that the service was unbelievable every part of the crew helped each other so no one went untouched. The food and the drinks are unique and delicious I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"We love the Clever Koi, the food is delicious, drinks are out of this world, and the staff is just amazing! We just celebrated my husband's birthday there tonight and it was perfect, from the birthday wishes to the mini Bundt cakes that I brought that we're perfectly plated and brought out with smiles, it could not have been a better experience! Thank you Clever Koi for another great night"}
{"text":"My family and I celebrated two birthdays here last weekend and all thirteen of us walked out saying, \"That was great food and excellent service!\"  We loved the fact that we were able to choose our own individual meals. We all had such different palettes and we were not disappointed in our choices for lunch. Nick, David, and Josh know how to treat patrons, thank you!! We will be back for dinner:-)"}
{"text":"Fantastic Food, Adult Beverages, Service and excellent value!    

I normally like to wait until i've been somewhere a couple times before posting a review.  I feel like there are a lot of Yelpers out there who will just go somewhere, pick up on one bad thing and then bash a place or will have one good experience and go rave about a place.  That being said, I really enjoy The Clever Koi and i've been a few times now.  

I eat a lot of traditional Asian (mostly Japanese) cuisine and i liked everything i ordered (which was a lot). The Chinese long beans with crispy duck tongue was bright in flavor with a subtle smoky finish.  We tried all of the steam buns and while i did enjoy them all i thought the lamb pastrami and pekin duck were the best. The smoked pig face kimchi dumplings pretty my blew my mind.  I wasn't such a huge fan of the smoked octopus but i generally prefer octopus in raw or ceviche form.

Oh and not to forget, these guys know how to make some serious adult beverages. I like old fashions, sazeracs, manhattans, etc. but ended up having a couple of their \"Enablers\" as well as the \"Donny Wang Fizz\".  

This place certainly adds something to the area that was missing and i wouldn't be surprised to see another location open up soon because this place.  This is my new go to when a friend asks for a recommendation."}
{"text":"Came in for Koi Burger and Pork Belly Steamed bun for happy hour.  Yummy and we'll be back for dinner this weekend.  Excellent customer service and a cool vibe to the place."}
{"text":"I don't think I say anything bad about my experience here! Everything from the atmosphere to food to service was amazing.. Did I mention the food? My mouth is still watering from finishing up those delish banana fritters.. Save room for desert!! I went with a larger party and we had a handful of small plates, pig face dumplings, and pork belly and soft shell crab steamed buns to start. Everything was so yummy I wanted to lick the plates. Love this place and can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are seriously amazing. We had some dumplings and the chicken and waffle steamed buns to start. I am now obsessed with those buns. Genius idea. The chicken ramen was also delicious and just what I was craving. The drinks are STRONG; seriously, they are pricey, but you will get your money's worth! I had the Mai Tai and loved it. I can't wait to come back and try the others. Just a really fun place--cool atmosphere, friendly service, and unique dishes."}
{"text":"I had to unfortunately and violently force myself to vomit after this terrible experience. The \"bao\" was not all bao. The only good part was the spam which obviously is shipped to this establishment in a freakin' can and this amazing IPA beer from a bomb brewery, spam from a can and a great server....great service, she knows the place sucks though and That is my opinion not hers. God, where to begin...walk in, not welcomed...ugh standing in silence. Several employees noticed us, all were stagnant. We order 3 different bao's we received two and a waffle, not a bao. None were fluffy, pillowy bao goodness and even though the contents were decent, not great. The chicken wings, oh the wings....where to begin with this... well, I guess the unfortunate demise of the food in my stomach.... I hate, yes HATE under cooked wings. I worked at a famous wing establishmenr  for three years so I understand the difference between under cooked and a gross ass vein....these were raw therefore I had to force myself to vomit my entire meal and go somewhere else to have a solid meal. The hibiscus wings lacked so much in flavor and anything else that the very nice waitress brought us the sriracha wings...seriously, literally blood....no freaking joke, ran the restroom and forced myself to puke, then paid the $60 tab and went to another establishment to actually put food in belly...worst mistake of my January."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out and I had an old family friend in town who also likes Asian food so I grabbed the neighbors and headed down to check out an establishment that has been on the top of my \"to do\" list when it comes to eating out, for some time, The Clever Koi.

First, though we drove this time, it is easy to get to this place by getting off at the Indian School and Central light rail station (it is right next door to one of the great dive bars of Phoenix, the George and the Dragon), and first off, the building it is in is beautiful - wonderful modern architecture that makes this establishment especially inviting. Being on the thrifty side, we went for the happy hour that goes from 4 pm to 7 pm every day and I think we pretty much had every food item on the happy hour list. 

I have to admit, I wasn't a huge fan of the Edamame fritters ( a bit too dry) but the mini corn dog bites with Chinese sausage in the middle and the Chinese mustard (not too hot) and sriracha ketchup were great. I also liked the grilled veggi platter and both the lemongrass chicken and bulgogi beef additions were quite good. Oh they also do sriracha chicken wings that are worth getting and I was told they make the sriracha sauce in house. Oh, and the mini-corn dogs came with some small relishes (house pickled veggies), a sweet, thinly sliced cucumber and some pickled onions, both excellent.

Probably the highlight of the meal for me was what i would say is the best ramen I've head in Phoenix and really, some of the better ramen I've had almost anywhere - the sauce was flavorful and the noodles were cooked but not too soft - it came with a perfectly soft boiled egg, sliced in half, and too roasted pieces of pork belly that were delicious. I look forward to eating a lot more of this when the weather cools down.

As for drinks, excellent cocktails. I had a Pimm's cup and they do a great one, and I also had a dark and stormy made with in-house crafted all-spice bitters. Besides the cocktails (and I love me some cocktails) a nice local beer selection and I'm assuming a good wine selection. The one beer I was surprised not to see on the menu, was Hitachino Nest Beer, probably the best craft beer from Japan, it would be a natural for the overall selection of drinks and a perfect fit for the ramen. 

Oh, and because I believe if you are going to try a new place, you might as well go all the way, we had desert. The soft serve of the day was good but I'm not a huge ice cream fan. However, the peach fritters are what we call malasadas back in Hawaii, and are a fried round of sweet dough, rolled in sugar, and they were amazing here - and here is a fingers crossing to the chef changing the name to malasadas, where I think are a better description of this desert.

As for areas of improvement, not much, the service was great with a friendly server and other wait staff that quickly removed used plates and glasses and brough ice water on a regular basis. We needed the ice water because, for some reason, it was a bit on the warm side, or at least it seemed that way to me. 

All this being said, I truly enjoyed my dining experience. The location is a good one, right off the rail line, the building and establishment are beautiful, and the food and drinks are extremely good, at least from my perspective. Accordingly, if you are looking for a new place to try out, I strongly encourage you to consider checking out the Clever Koi and sharing your own perspective on Yelp. I'll be interested to see what you think. :-)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere has a clean, urban feel. The staff was nice and super accommodating.  I enjoyed the food selection for lunch. There was some interesting food choices that you do not normally see which made the meal fun!  The parking lot is very small and i had to park on the street, the bar George and Dragon was not kind to sharing their lot! The space is fun and i want to go back for drinks, just to enjoy the patio!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on a whim because I wanted to get out the house and get tacos and it's close to the place I was intending to go to.  The food gets a grade of F! Worst fried rice I've ever had. We had a couple appetizers and the consensus was that the food was definitely missing something and that something is flavor!!! Super bland and just not good at all.  I'm positive this will be my first and last time here. There's a lot of restaurants in the area, I should've went with my first mind and went to Barrio Queens."}
{"text":"Everything here is great! Totally underrated. Still here so good. Staying till close. The steamed bums are the truth. Sneaking in to make a midnight snack in there kitchen . Don't look in the bathroom."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times and it never disappoints.  I've been here for brunch and dinner and everything I have tried is always amazing.  I will say that the food is great but the cocktails are the star of the restaurant.  They make the best cocktails by far in Gilbert and they pour heavy!  Service sometimes is hit or miss but worth the wait and won't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is casual but has a very nice appearance. The food is so delicious I would highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here Wednesday night because of a YELP review and the review was so true.  This was one of the best dinners I have had in a long time.  This very modern Asian restaurant has an incredible menu and with the suggestions of our FANTASTIC server David, we ordered the Pig Face Dumplings, Chicken & Waffles Steamed Buns, S&S Chicken with Rice and Spicy Seafood Hot Pot.   Yes a lot of food, we took leftovers home but only after eating Banana Foster Fritters.  Not a large red wine selection but I tried a excellent red wine from Greece and was extremely pleased.
What a great place, with great people and wonderful food. Can't wait to go back for lunch."}
{"text":"Clever Koi is a really awesome spot located right on Central. I've only been here once but the inside looks awesome and the patio was great as well. I love their lunch special because you get to create your own bowl with pretty much anything in it. The food and drinks were very delicious and I would absolutely recommend coming here for lunch but I will update again if I go for dinner sometime!"}
{"text":"Went there directly from airport because I read a nice review in WSJ.  I'm a big ramen fan having eaten it for years throughout Asia and especially while living in Tokyo.

Like most other Asian or ethnic food in AZ, it was run by the local hipsters.  I again was the only Asian in the place.  Not a knock, just always feels weird for me.  Alone, I chose the counter, and ordered the local IPA and was served my ramen with pork belly soon after.  It was hearty and good, albeit small.  The girl at the counter was very nice, as well as the bearded beer guy.  I would return again for lunch."}
{"text":"Clever in charging a lot of underwhelming flavors is what I got from my visit.  The crowd is downtown hippsters, who want to be seen. The bar and the drinks were probably the best part of my dining experience.  Staff friendly and helpful.   I watched one of the owners on 3TV mentioned it's not an Asian fusion place..however, the decor is very Asian not the cooks! Very confusing. Regardless Clever Koi is Asian \"inspired\" however the dishes are not very flavorful, over priced and need salt and other spices.   The ramen was $13 for a little bowl.  The broth is the key.    It tasted like beef broth with a little bit of soy, very tasteless and I would not go again for it.  Kimchi Fried Rice...didn't taste like Kimchi.  The turkey leg..meh.  The buns were the only thing that was \"good\"  I would only go for the buns and the drinks.  Keep working on your flavors and regardless if it's something new and out of the box, it needs to be tasty and Clever Koi isn't there yet."}
{"text":"AZ Restaurant week, went with the intent to take advantage of the tasting menu, but opted out when we saw so many other items I wanted to try. I made Saturday 7:30 Opentable dinner reservations at the Gilbert location. Love the atmosphere. our server Christian was very good and attentive.

We ordered cocktails, the shaken Unholy Alliance was amazing along with the traditional Margarita. Food was the Galbi Short Ribs, Trio of Buns (softshell crab and the pork belly), Chicken Dumplings and the House Pad Thai with Shrimp. All the food and drinks were amazing, the weakest dish was the Pad Thai. I will definitely be back to try other menu items.

Atmosphere: trendy, Service: very good, Food: very good."}
{"text":"Got seated right away on a Friday night. Wonderful customer service and atmosphere. Our waitress was very attentive and thanked us for coming. We each got a steamed pork bun that was delicious. I got the spicy Thai beef rice with tempura scallions. I ate the entire bowl. The steak was delicious and perfectly cooked. My husband loved his pork ramen. We'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Our party of 9 had this month's Foodie Adventure at this fun and amazing establishment chosen by Jesus who works in our Culinary Operations at CTCA and personally knows the chef; who we didn't get a chance to meet in person as we saw that he was extremely busy doing what he does best in the kitchen. I'm pretty confident that we didn't get VIP treatment and am very ok with that, I just don't you to view my opinion as skewed. Just the appetizers alone were fantastic! Each dish was a creative combination of flavors and textures. Hats off to the Chef for an exceptional adventure. We'll be back sometime soon, for sure! Thank you Chef"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a double date night at Clever Koi with a couple friends last week Sunday. We had reservations for 630 pm which wasn't needed. It really wasn't busy. Although I am sure if it was a Friday or Saturday night you would need reservations. Our waitress was new, I forgot her name but she looks like Mandy Moore =), she upfront told us she was new and any questions we had and she didn't know she was more than willing to find out. She was really great and gave us tips and suggestions on dishes that was helpful. My friend and I shared the bowl drink (menu specifically says shoudld share with at least 2 people). It was perfect to share with my friend. We are not big drinkers but we felt that it was the right amount and Good! One of those where you don't really taste the alcohol and it sneaks up on you. Haha!
My husband and I shared the chicken & waffle appetizer. Sounds simple but the sauce they put on it...so good!  We also shared the kimichi fried rice and chicken pad Thai. I don't remember what my friends ordered but we were all happy. 
I do wish they had more vegetarian and chicken options though. 
At the end of the day, this is a place I would recommend and would come back again."}
{"text":"Came here for HH.  Sat on the patio.  Ordered drinks and ramen. Friend got wings no nuts.  Drinks took over 10 minutes, had to ask some random employee to check on them. Another random girl brought them to us, spilling the overfilled cocktails on the way. Drinks were good. Food showed up shortly after. Ramen was good, friends wings still had peanuts on them. Nothing special, maybe come here for hh but I don't think I'd come here any other time."}
{"text":"We've wanted to try this restaurant for a long time. Finally visited two weeks ago. While it was difficult to make a reservation, when I called I was advised that we could walk in and get a table or sit in front of the kitchen. 

The food was exceptional!
- we shared the mussels and the short-rib dumplings. Both amazing. The former is a substantial dish and the latter is quite small (but delicious). 
- I had the Kimchi fried rice with chicken - delicious.
- My better half had the Pad Thai

A lot of food but absolutely delicious (we are headed back on Thursday night). Can't say enough good things about this gem of a restaurant. 

We had a nice bottle of wine and cocktails. The latter were wonderful."}
{"text":"I heard great things about Clever Koi from two friends so I decided to try it out with my boyfriend. We went around 6:30pm on a Friday and sat at the bar as we were told there was about a 20 min. wait for the table. Although, I have to say there were multiple tables available and I don't believe they were for reservations as they were empty the whole time we were there. Anyway... we ordered the duck steamed buns, sweet potato dumplings, duck chow mein, and their special of the night which was yellowtail over rice with black kale and persimmons. The duck steamed buns were really good, but pricey. The sweet potato dumplings reminded me of empanadas as the shell was fried, like a taco kind of way, not a fried dumpling kind of way. However, I really enjoyed them. However, I was very disappointed in my entree. It was super salty. The fish was salty, the kale was salty, even the rice was salty. I tried a bite of the duck chow mein and it was ok, not a huge fan of chow mein anyway so I'm no judge there. For all that, the bill came to about $60. Super disappointed but at least that's another restaurant I can check off of my list. But if you're looking for an asian fusion place, I'd check out SumoMaya, also a little pricey but at least the food's really good!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I popped in here recently after constantly talking about how we wanted to try out the food. I really enjoy Asian food and my bf tends to be a bit less adventurous in his dinner selections so every so often we go out and try a new place. I found this place to be very cool and trendy with good ambiance. We dropped by on a weekday so it wasn't overly busy. The staff was very friendly and provided great service. I really enjoyed the food. I had originally been craving sushi but the food definitely hit the spot! We ordered the calamari fries for an appetizer and we both really liked those. I ordered the Pad Thai with shrimp and it was extremely good! My bf got the lemon pepper chicken ramen and he really liked that as well. I had a bit of his and it was very tasty. I liked that the taste wasn't super overpowering. The flavoring was really well balanced. I think overall it was a great experience and we will absolutely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"The Clever Koi is a modern take on traditional Asian cuisine. They serve wonderful noodle dishes, steamed buns and house made dumplings. They also have an interesting and exciting mix of hand crafted cocktails. It has a comfortable modern setting with a nice long bar and expansive patio that faces Central. 

We stopped in for happy hour the other day and were pleasantly surprised with the prices and variety of cocktails and eats. We started with the beets, they came with cucumber, pickeled ginger, bean curd and a lemongrass vinaigrette. It was beautifully plated, but the amount of soy was so overwhelming it was difficult to eat(and the beets weren't completely ripe). For the noodle bowl we tried the roasted pork, it came with bacon, mustard greens, bean sprouts, shitake mushrooms and a soft egg. It was delicious. I had to try the steamed buns and went for the squid sausage that the bartender recommended. It was amazing and I loved the aioli it was dressed in. 
I had \"The Enabler\" which was hickory whiskey, grilled lemon juice, burlesque bitters. It had a slow smoke flavor that stayed in my mouth long after the drink was done.

The bartenders were awesome, we had a great experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. I had the Chilean salmon and my hubby ordered the veggie ramen. We shared and the dishes were just the right portions. Definitely try the steamed buns - catfish tempura and soft shell crab were cooked to perfection. Desserts change but the banana foster beignets and pineapple upside down cake were delightful. Highly recommend when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great fusion food! I had the lemon pepper chicken ramen and actually ate all of it (I very rarely finish my food) with a glass of wine to complement the flavor.
I'm so glad this place was recommended!"}
{"text":"I do not have enough descriptives for how incredible our evening was. We order several small plates and cocktails as recommended by our servers. Each was amazing. The teriyaki short rib, goat cheese dumplings, all of the steamed buns, the forbidden fried rice, and the pork belly ramen are only some of what we ordered. Each item was delicious. 

The bartenders are extremely talented and wowed us with their creations. The wait staff works as a team, and there was always someone stopping at our table to clear a dish or assist us with the ordering of another beverage or menu item. 

We had a wonderful evening, which was capped with the black sticky rice and bananas foster fritters."}
{"text":"Oh yesssss. 
After having book marked this place for a while, I finally got a chance to eat here.

Nice and clean. Staff is exceptionally friendly. Food is very worth the hundreds of positive reviews. Lunch specials are great!

What really made the experience top notch is the attentiveness of the people who own/work here.

I ordered the ramen with pork belly, which was delicious! I don't know what sorcery they use but the pork belly was crispy and succulent. 

But I am trying to watch what I eat, so instead of devouring the pork belly (like I would have normally done), I took it apart and only ate the leaner portions. When one of the guys noticed the scraps, he asked if I wanted more leaner pieces. Now. That's what I call great service and attention to their patrons needs. 

Check it out! I can't wait till my next visit!"}
{"text":"This is by far my husband and I's favorite restaurant in town! We take all of it out-of-towners here. I cannot say enough good things about this place. 

The staff is wonderful, always kind and attentive. The craft cocktails are so delicious and creative. The steamed buns and dumplings are to incredible, I suggest the pork belly. I've tried several  of the entrees but my all time favorite is the Thai Chili Beef - the crispy scallions OMG. 

I recommend sitting at the back bar and watching the chefs, so fun! Definitely try this place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We had the grilled calamari, best grilled I've had in a long time!! The Beef Cobb and pork belly ramen. It was all great. We did the two for two Tuesday and the 2 wines available for the deal were great!  Well balanced, good flavor not too strong in any direction although my husband thinks the Greek wine was too dry.  I actually liked that one better, but either fantastic. Service and friendliness. Great!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing; the cocktails are impressive. I will return again and again. The service is a bit slow. We had no place to be and felt perfectly content to enjoy the pace, but I could see how this might not be acceptable for some dinners. For me, it was worth the wait for perfectly executed, well thought out plates and drinks. Big recommendation to the sticky buns and the tuna chip app, the menu description for the tuna does it no justice, they should put it in lights; it's amazing."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place.  My favorite are the Pork Belly Steamed buns and the pork Belly Chow mien.  Great atmosphere!!  Awesome servers."}
{"text":"The service is so good here. Beautiful drinks and beautiful bar. And beautiful food! Edamame corn fritters were amazing, loved the sauce. Avocado and tofu bao were great. Wish there was a peanut sauce! Liked the flavor of the corn ramen but don't love the consistency, I wish they had a vegan/vegetarian clear broth rather than a purée type broth. Tofu chow mien was off the charts. Our server Bryce was so helpful. so veggie friendly it's almost overwhelming! Coming back always"}
{"text":"The food here is just amazing.  It never disappoints and the service is the same!  If you haven't been here...you are missing out!  Stop reading the reviews and go try it yourself."}
{"text":"We decided to dine here this Friday , on arrival place was busy , we probably waited about 15 min to get seated , not too bad. Our server dropped two glasses of water at our table and left. When she came she asked us what we wanted to drink. No hi, didn't even introduce herself, didn't ask if we were here before. I sat my menu down and asked what's her name was, I think she got a hint and when she told us that the have team here and everybody will be helping us. Well we do get it , some short introduction would have been nice though, this is not fast food restaurant and for over $100 a dinner for two we do expect a better service. Small talk is needed. Drinks from the bar came out fast and they were great. For appetizers we enjoyed duck fat wings and short rib dumplings, very tasty. Entrees were taking awhile and our server did apologize couple times, we told her not to worry about the wait as we enjoying our night and not rushing anywhere. Entrees came out. We ordered pineapple duck and Thai chili beef. We truly don't care that food took longer than expected , what we do care about is the fact after waiting for so long you gave us cold food. Obviously duck was prepared way before beef , it was cold to touch and it was just warm throughout, rice for beef was cold as well, they put warm meat on top of it."}
{"text":"Do not order the crispy chicken sandwich. It should be called the butter sandwich with chicken instead. After one bite, I had to take the bread off of the sandwich. There was so much butter, it felt and tasted like the two pieces of bread were fried. I took a bite into the chicken alone, and had a hard time swallowing it down due to the excessive richness and butter. I threw the entree away after my third bite (I ordered through UberEATS) because all I tasted was cilantro. Cilantro tastes like soap to me, and I would have asked for them to leave it off if it were listed in the ingredients. Worst sandwich I've ever had.
At that point I was thankful that I had ordered the pork face dumplings as well. However, they were served with sriracha rather than a broth/dumpling dipping sauce. All I could taste was sriracha.
Overall the experience was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Went here and ordered off the restaurant week menu. The tropical tea was delicious, good flavors and tad sweetness.  For appetizer, I got the short rib  dumplings which were good, but nothing particularly tasty about them. I did try the two house sriracha flavors with them, not impressed. The broth the dumplings was in was greasy and lacked flavor.  For my main dish (at the recommendation of my server) I got the short rib. It was with a Korean BBQ sauce and placed atop a cold potato salad. I enjoyed the short rib, the flavor was delicious but I ate none of the potato salad, it was cold and the flavors (in my opinion) didn't mesh. It also had plantain chips mixed in the potato salad, the texture was so weird. It was chewy and stuck in my teeth and was almost thin-shaved like a coconut texture. Not a fan. Lastly, we ordered the mousse (at the recommendation of the server). I felt like, \"hey, you can't go wrong with dessert. Right?\". WRONG. The mousse was a white chocolate mousse, which was bland, and a citrus compote with a crumble topping. The mousse was ok and the topping was alright; however, the compote just completely ruined this dish and made it near inedible. I had to scrape the topping to the side to even be able to eat a part of it. The compote was like biting right into a lemon. It was so gross.  Please save your money and just go to sushi brokers across the way. We spent $95 for two people and didn't even order alcohol. It was terrible. I also want to note my husband ordered the Pad Thai and wasn't impressed with that either. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I have eaten here at least a dozen times. The duck curry and riding the pine cocktail are mind blowing unbelievable. I have never had curry as good as this. 

However, I've had other items on the menu that are made with impressive culinary technique but can be over bearing or flat out missing the mark. I definitely recommend going with a group so you can share dishes and find what you like the best! 

Ambience is great! Candle lit, great date spot!"}
{"text":"Have been excited to try this place out and finally did today for lunch. Started off with the steamed buns (seriously soooo soft and perfect) ordered the peking duck, pickled pineapple, and lamb pastrami. It would have been nice to have another slice of meat for the lamb pastrami, since it was pretty small for the size of the bun. But all were very delicious! Meal wise I ordered the Chicken Katsu which came with Kimchi, a poached egg, Nori, and Teriyaki. I killed that bowl clean. My girlfriend had the Roasted Pork Ramen with house bacon, pickled mustard greens, a poached egg, bean sprouts, and shiitake. She loved it! My friends ordered the seafood ramen with udon noodles and the only bad thing they had to say was that they wish it was in a bigger bowl with more broth. 

The restaurant setting was super chill and all the workers were friendly. However, the only part that limited me from giving 5 stars was the wait time. Especially after we were finished eating it took a while to finally receive our check... but it is still newly opened so i'm sure they'll master that in no time. 

definitely will be back for more :)"}
{"text":"Slow service. This was the most disappointment of all outside of the food. The waiters and waitress took a long time to come to the table, and to see how we were doing. The food was nothing to write about. My overall experience is that I wont come back."}
{"text":"First time there and was so happy.  Amazing atmosphere.  We sat outside and it was perfect weather with the mist.

Waiter got slammed with 4 tables at once and handled it pretty well.

We had tuna chips and galbi appetizers both very delicious.  Galbi was on point but has to get side of rice cuz I'm Asian ;). We got Chow Meil to share and it was just ok in comparison to the appetizers.  

We will definitely come back and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good but not good enough for us to want to return. My husband and I had been scouring yelp to find an amazing restaurant for our anniversary and stumbled upon this place due to the reviews. Located in a really cool building with lots of rustic wood and glass displaying the kitchen and dining area. I loved the \"sushi bar-esque\" seating in front of the kitchen where you could literally watch them making your food. I had such high hopes upon reading rave reviews and arriving at this place but the food and service did not back up the aesthetics.

We were told to wait upon arrival because they needed to \"reorganize\", even though there were plenty of open tables. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated without being offered a menu or drinks. When another couple came in and was immediately seated I asked why we were skipped and she said they had a reservation and she was just about to seat us anyways, coincidentally. Would be nice if their website advertised/allotted reservations so I could have done the same. Not one time while we were waiting though did I see any \"reorganizing\", or moving of tables in the dining room.

Upon being seated we were handed menus and I have to say there was a great variety of dishes on the menu that you don't see often. Pig face dumplings and steamed bun assortments.  That was exciting. I ordered the Tofu soft bun and my husband ordered the Softshell Crab and the Pork Belly buns. As we went to pick our buns up from their holders, the outsides of the buns were stuck! Most of it was torn and stuck to the holders which was disappointing. Maybe lightly oiling the holders or having non stick holders in the future would prevent losing some of your bun. Overall good flavor and definitely the highlight of the whole meal. I would almost suggest ordering a variety of those as your meal, asian taco style.

Main entrees consisted of the Roasted corn Ramen for myself and the Seafood Hot Pot for my husband along with plenty of their handcrafted cocktails. 2 bartenders for the whole restaurant was probably not the best idea. We waited a long time for drinks, 15 minutes or more sometimes and thats only because we had to flag down our waitress whom looked a bit lost. It was confusing as well because almost every item was brought by a different waiter/waitress which made it hard to connect with our own server.

Roasted Corn Ramen was rich and creamy with great extraction of corn flavor.Just wish they had either allowed me to add the tempura corn on my own or left it to be plated on top last minute because it was really mushy in the ramen once it reached me and lost all of its crispy crunch. 
Seafood Hot Pot was lacking in seafood. You can't call something seafood and only put out 2 types of seafood. They should call it shrimp and octopus ramen. Thats what it was. Flavor was there though and the homemade srirachas were a great touch. 

All in all it was good, not great, no hard feelings but they should focus more on the basics than what will look cool and different."}
{"text":"Ambience is great, location and decor on point! Quality of food goes hand in hand with the qualities aforementioned.Sadly, the 2 stars review will be based on customer service. This will be the first and last time we visit this place. We love trying new food and don't mind waiting if the quality of the food and service are up to par. Waited for over 40 minutes for food and it never arrived!The 3 waiters did not check on you (Avoid the table next to the hostess podium, seems to be invisible to them) After we asked for our food to go, it still took 20 extra minutes. The attitude of the personnel was extremely poor at the end after asking for a simple mistake to be corrected. We felt ignored most of the time and as such, cannot recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Met a few friends for lunch here a week or so ago.  We all ordered something different and all were delighted with our choices.  There are several menu items that are available for \"Happy Hour\" which is during the lunch hour, which is nice.  I had the Banh Mi at the Happy Hour price.  It was a sandwich with pork on it and the Asian flavors on it.  I had the fries with it and they were quite good.''

We sat on the patio because the weather was nice.  Only issue with that was the tree that shades the patio had lots of leaves and small flowers and all the other stuff that comes with trees dropping on us and the food.  It didn't bother us--we just had to be careful what we were putting in our mouths was food and not tree \"stuff\".

Our waiter was a nice guy--not overbearing and let us alone which we appreciated.

Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place is super yummy. Been here for the food a couple of times and also went to one of their cocktail camps. The food is upscale modern Asian. That being said it is not pretentious. There is inside and outside seating and is in this cool little location. Pork belly is always a must. Ramen is nice and tasty especially now that the weather is changing."}
{"text":"Yummmm my husband and I wanted to try something new and not a chain restaurant. So I opened yelp and said why not. Love the chill environment not to loud just perfect. We ordered the tuna chips and soft shell crab steam buns as an appetizer. It has lots of flavor and was just delicious. For dinner my husband ordered the salmon on taro cake he killed it said it was good. I ordered the special which was the korean  gochujang beef noodles lots of flavor. Will definitely return to try different items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Green Tea Noodle salad. I don't typically like cold noodles, but this was quite good. My husband started with the beet salad which was also quite good. For my main meal I ordered the chow mein with shrimp. Much to my delight it came with pieces of catfish and scallops. Yum! My husband got the pork something. I don't eat meat so I wasn't interested, but he liked it.

Restaurant is nicely decorated. The only thing that I didn't like was the smoke. The restaurant is an open floor plan so the kitchen is right there. Unfortunately, the smoke from the kitchen easily wafts throughout the entire restaurant. I just smelled my shirt and I still smell like food. Also, you can't get anything from the dinner menu at lunch so we will return for dinner to try that delicious looking shrimp & scallop appetizer."}
{"text":"Really good quality food with great servers. I don't think you will be disappointed with whatever you order. We got the hot pot and the pork chop ramen and they were fantastic."}
{"text":"I saw photos from here on Instagram and FB, i was super excited to try their food. So one Saturday i decided to travel uptown to try it out, looked so cute and amazing from the outside, the tacky \"asian\" decor didn't turn me off one bit, neither did the upscale price tag for the food, but (there is always a but) the weird insanely tangy sauces and broth for the \"soups\" did.. i am not sure what the chefs were thinking, but these are not flavors meant for these dishes, at all.. 

i like \"fusion\" food as much as the next guy but the lamb pastrami bun tasted as they just saw one in a magazine and tried to match it without reading the ingredients.

kimchi fried rice, it was more of typical Chinese fried with clear kimchi thrown on top of it, which is \"technically\" kimchi fried rice, but not what it is supposed to be.  There was a sour element to it that is not found in Korean cuisine, that could just be due to the fusion.  

up next we have the \"ramen\" .. uhm, if all you have had is Top Ramen, you may find this blend delightful or just amazingly odd, as for me, i enjoy my Japanese food, so this tangy mess was definitely a let down as well.

another one of us ordered some katsu thing, but that is not even worth describing, unless you have a sweet tooth.

the duck steamed bun was the only savior of the bunch, my only gripe was the bao was much too dense, and i ended up leaving half it on my plate, when usually that is the best part. 

If the pricing wasn't so pretentious, i would have thought about giving this two stars."}
{"text":"Awesome ramen, very flavorful and great service. Place is small but very cute and well decorated. Great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Clever Koi brings you modern Asian fusion dishes meets west coast vibes all mixed into one. Clever right? Parking lot area  is small but they do offer free valet which you can tip via cash or with the bravo app for your the one who doesn't carry dollar bills on you! Right when you walk into the hallways, you'll notice other small/ big restaurants check those out if you're waiting for a table it can get busy but I went and I didn't wait that long so everything all worked out. Inside is so, very eye pleasing lots of complimentary colors bar is close to the wok action/kitchen smaller than I expected but seating was all arranged nicely. Let's talk about the food, it was happy hour read some reviews known for their cocktails I liked how they have a special well gin and tonic which is my favorite very refreshing get it if you like gin! Got the Spicy tuna chips well played and tasted even delicious I also ordered the vegetable kimchi fried rice with tofu! Awesome everything was to a T!
Service was wonderful the GM/ Owner was on grounds making sure everything was right and even asked us how our food was, which is awesome the hostess then became waiter was cool! Definitely a cool hip trendy and growing restaurant awesome people! Arizona check it out if your in uptown or close to downtown! Stay hungry tho and be cool!"}
{"text":"Yum. My first visit and I loved it I had the veggie Ramen with shrimp added. It was full of lots of different vegetables including roasted sunchokes which I love and don't often see places the broth was very savory. my friend had the chicken lettuce wraps and it looked wonderful and she really enjoyed it as well. The service was great both the host and the server were very attentive the establishment is welcoming and modern inside and was clean. There is table seating as well as high bar tops. And an outside patio. There's also Specialties for a lunch happy hour that are discounted. I will definitely be back I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This place is everything I've been looking for in a restaurant, in the Valley. Meticulously masterminded! Service, Cocktails, Food, Decor, Ambience... it was all so exquisitely crafted. Love it when places take a risk with their dishes and introduce flavor and texture combinations that are far from the norm. I would love to see this team open other restaurant concepts. Their work ethic and artistry is truly a breath of fresh air in this dry, dry desert. 

Came here a second time and didn't disappoint. They found themselves a new regular."}
{"text":"If you're reading this review to decide where to eat, look no further. You've found the greatest restaurant in the whole Earth.

I came here for my birthday dinner last night and I LOVED e v e r y t h i n g about it! The overall atmosphere was upbeat and chic. We sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen - definitely the best seats in the house because everyone working in the kitchen is so dope and friendly.

The menu offered innovative choices with unique ingredients (foodie approved). We started with The Enabler to drink. YUM. Then we ordered pig face and rabbit dumplings, and BBQ jackfruit steam buns for dinner. It was sooo good. I drooled all my lipstick off real quick. For dessert we got banana fritters, and they were FIRE. They forgot to put the birthday candle on it so they also gave us fruity pebble mochi ice cream with a candle!!! It. Was. Lit! (Pun intended)

This restaurant is the be all and end all. My new favorite. The only food I'll ever want."}
{"text":"This place is solid. Solid food, hand crafted cocktails and solid service. Great place for drinks and sharable plates. They care and it shows."}
{"text":"I like this Asian fusion place. It is a small casual dining place that specializes noodles. For appetizer I ordered the pig face wontons which came with Kimchee garnish. It was a super combination of texture and the taste was superb. I tried the cold soba noodles with Kimchee and tofu. Soba noodles had to be one of the best I've ever had. Tofu had a unique flavor and I was taken aback. It still was good, just different. Service was good as well. I recommend!"}
{"text":"Hands down most impressed I've been with a first meal at a new place in years. Porkbelly Ramen & Curry Duck Noodles were equally amazing. 3 small plates were each perfect. 

The guys here care about the food they are making you and are super friendly. 

New local favorite"}
{"text":"Love this place! The drinks are super creative and delicious, the bartenders are really friendly and funny, and the food is ridiculously good. The sriracha wings in particular are fantastic, I get them almost every time. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just finished having lunch at Clever Koi Phoenix. The food was delicious but took a long time to come out. Guests who had arrived and were seated 5-10 min after we ordered, received their meals before we did. That could have been overlooked but the service we received was absolutely awful. It seemed like a battle to get more water while we were waiting for our food. The bartender filled up our waters half way and then never returned to fill them back up. It's hot outside and water should be the one thing that never stays empty at a table. Overall the food was decent but the service is what will keep us away."}
{"text":"I love this place! Happy hour everyday- who couldn't love that... everything we have had here has meet or exceeded exceptions. But out of the items I have had so far- absolutely love all the steamed puns but particularly the pork belly... cocktails are delicious but in this hot weather- the Avenue is hitting the spot. And finally the pork ramen- on the happy hour menu and very satisfying. 

You should definitely check this place out, especially if you are craving Asian."}
{"text":"Terrible. Overpriced. Ordered seafood hot pot and seafood was undercooked. Made me sick. Not coming back. Even Chicken wings were very bland. I really dont understand the hype."}
{"text":"I love this place! Parking is in the back. This place is always packed, but you're seated fairly quickly. I came here just for their steamed buns and ordered their chicken and waffle, pork belly, and soft shell crab. 

Pork belly: the meat is lightly deep fried so the outer layer is slightly crispy but is super tender and juicy on the inside. It has so much flavor with the perfect amount of sweetness from the hoisin sauce and you get some freshness from the cilantro. 

Soft shell: the soft shell is lightly deep fried, topped with carrots and cucumber! It was tangy from the lemon sauce but it went well with the soft shell crab. 

Unfortunately, I was unable to eat the chicken and waffle because I got full after I ate the soft shell crab steamed buns."}
{"text":"We love this place, delicious unique dishes, wonderful service and a trendy laid back atmosphere. All of these qualities have put clever koi in my top 3 restaurants in the central Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place but found the food mediocre. My friend and I ordered the kimchi fried rice with lemongrass chicken and the lemon pepper chicken ramen. As a huge ramen fan, I was so excited to try this. However, to my disappointment, the broth lacked flavor and to be honest just tasted bland. I had to add lots of pepper to add flavor to it (I can't do spicy... so the fact that I added lots of pepper says a lot). The kimchi fried rice was not too bad, but not great either. Both entrees had generous portion sizes. I wish the food tasted as good they looked.

Everything else was decent. Service was good, the ambiance is cute and there are indoor and outdoor seating areas. I'd come back again to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Despite being crowded the hostess found us a table which was nice to be seated promptly on a Friday night. The service was average, there were times when we were out of water and waiting for our food, but nothing too terrible. We had a chicken and waffle dumpling as well as a pork belly dumpling and both were fair and somewhat pricy for a small portion. We had the pad Thai with chicken and it was too greasy and lacking chicken. We also had the vegetable curry with tofu which was delicious but also lacking tofu and very pricy for the portion size. Overall it was ok."}
{"text":"Me and my wife have never eaten here before but have heard great things about it. We happen to be in Phoenix at the time even though we live way closer to the Gilbert location and figured we would try them out. We were not disappointed what so ever. The service was amazing, they had someone who personally came out just to make sure your water is full which is always a nice touch at any restaurant. The drinks were superb or so says my wife since I didn't have any mixed drinks just beer haha. The food was just as great as the service. I ordered Pork Ramen and my wife ordered the XO Noodles which where very tasty and the flavors easily complimented each other with nothing over powering them. Unfortunately we were both full from the food so we didn't do dessert this time around although there was a couple next to us who kept commenting to each other about one of the desserts and how amazing it tasted. I didn't get the name but I can tell this place enjoys great food and great service. I would definitely come back to Clever Koi again most likely the Gilbert location though but it just depends we go to Phoenix often as well for food and things."}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix. Enjoyed a relaxing night on Koi's patio- both great ambiance and awesome food. 

Vegetarian friendly menu- one of the best things we had was the crudite with tzatziki sauce. Fresh, crisp vegetables was a nice start to our meal. 

Definitely try the pork buns!!

Cocktails are on point."}
{"text":"I must say they have such an awesome staff team. Made reservations for dinner and table was prepared and ready when we arrived at 8. Our server Katelyn was so friendly and knew everything on the menu. I must recommend the baos! The pork and crab ones was sooo good! Management team stopped by a few times to check w us too. Would def come back to get more of the pork buns"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and it's delicious. The lavender bees knees and dark and stormy cocktail are amazing, I love the noodles and the crispy duck. Brought family here and they loved it"}
{"text":"Really cool spot on Central. They have an impressive bar to go along with some bomb ramen. The duck ramen is an experience for sure. Intense spice, with tasty duck medallions, thick noodles, nice amount of red peppers and peanuts. They have a good special too that includes 2 bowls of ramen and 4 drinks or a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"This review is for take out only!
I ordered the duck curry and was pretty impressed by the presentation, it looked awesome. 
Very interesting combination. I did enjoy the curry and the duck. The heat was nice, the spices blended well. I was not a fan of the peppers and I wish it was served with rice instead of udon. 
Besides that everything was good and I will make sure to try out some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Food was very good, great place to try when you need some time alone or with friends. Gave four stars because i am not a fan of kimchi and i had the pork ramen bowl but the deserts and appetizers are amazing."}
{"text":"Watered down Asian food, would not recommend for anybody looking for authentic Asian food of any sort:

My girlfriends and I decided to check out this place in downtown Gilbert, and were absolutely disappointed by everything we ordered. From the \"chicken and waffles steamed bun\" (in which there was no steamed bun), to the confit chicken wings (Buffalo wild wings does a much better job), to the salmon entrée, to the chicken Ramen, all the dishes were incredibly bland and lacking in flavor. We try to add what we thought was hot sauce, only to realize that the bottle labeled \"sriracha,\" was a sweet and tangy sauce, that tasted more like ketchup than actual hot sauce. This somewhat makes sense, as this restaurant is advertised as an \"Asian American fusion\", and the dishes are likely designed to appeal to a more Western audience....however, for anybody looking for authentic Asian food, this is absolutely not the place to go..."}
{"text":"We went here for restaurant week.  Such a cute place with a great environment. Everyone is super nice. The servers are all very attentive. Food was excellent. Can't say enough nice things for a place I just recently tried.  Will definitely come back and home they continue their superb service and cuisine!"}
{"text":"We chose a good day to stop by because I can see why the restaurant would be packed otherwise. Restaurant itself is more on the smaller size. I ordered the pork ramen that seems to be so popular here and it was just okay to me. Noodles were a but clumped and tasted too al dente for my liking. Pork belly lacked a bit of flavor and there was nothing really memorable about the dish except for the soft boiled eggs. My girlfriend had the seafood hot pot I believe and it was good too. But for the price we paid, there was more to be expected from these dishes. Though I will say, the grilled squid was good, it had a nice chew to it and good flavor. Service was good and the ambiance was very quaint, just wish the food stood out a bit more."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a new spot in Downtown Gilbert to celebrate our anniversary.  What a great find Clever Koi turned out to be.We got there in time to still take advantage of Happy Hour.  We tried several different menu items and they were all very good.  The 
portions were just right.
We had the Duck Fat Sriracha wings, the Pork Ramen, the Spicy Sriracha Noodles all off of the Happy Hour Menu.  We also had the Kimchi Fried Rice and a Soft Shell Crab.
Everything (really everything!) we tried was very good.  The wings were especially good.  The spice was perfect and the sweet/hot combo was very nice.  They give you a couple of jars of their house made Sriracha Sauces (one red and one green).  These were also very good and gave each one of the noodle and rice dishes another flavor level.
Our server (Pedro) was excellent.  Great service and very knowledgeable about all of the menu items and drinks.  He recommended the Bees Knees for my wife and she loved it.  He was very attentive without being overbearing.  
We will definitely return (there are so many interesting menu items that we have to try) and recommend the Clever Koi.
We were surprised that they had only been open for three weeks.  We did not experience any of the hiccups normally associated with a new restaurant.  It felt like they had been open for years already."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! The modern decor and the friendly staff mixed with the awesome food makes this a great restaurant. Hands down this is my favorite places to get a bowl ramen. I've had the pork ramen and vegetable ramen and both are so flavorful and appetizing. I can't forget about the pork belly and chicken/waffle buns, both are a must when visiting this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is descent but not really if you are Asian or have an Asian taste pallet. The best was the pork belly bun the only... Only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars...    Granit this place does get packed but to get your food takes some time.   Id say this place is fun hang out spot if you can hear well and talk loudly"}
{"text":"The food tasted fine... But the portions are incredibly small and the food is very expensive. I ordered the fried rice and it was probably a couple scoops of rice with a few shrimp in it. I was still hungry when I was done with my meal. I will probably not be going back here because there are several great and cheaper options in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Never disappoints! The kimchi is on point. Excellent and consistent. Great service. The Pig Face dumplings are so good."}
{"text":"The food was delish!! I recommend this spot. Awesome service! Thank you to one of the Owners Nick he was so awesome! Looking forward to coming back down SoCal when we come visit AZ again!"}
{"text":"Trendy, modern type of restaurant that serves Asian fusion.

I had a hankering for some ramen and saw that TCK did a version all their own and decided to try it out. Luckily, it was also happy hour so I got to go for their Pork Ramen priced at $8. I sat at the bar and it was pretty empty, even for happy hour.

The Pork Ramen came out with roasted palm hearts, kimchi, roasted pork belly, green onions and a soft boiled egg garnished with Togarashi. The broth is not Tonkotsu, but pretty simple. I enjoyed the ramen noodles as they were thick with a good chew. The pork belly was good, a bit tough but had this great roasted texture on the outside- almost crispy. Soft boiled egg was good! Perfect portion for ramen as well! 

Service seemed lacking, but I was checked up on. Probably due to the place being a bit slow at the time, I mean I did seat myself since nobody was at the store front. Haha!

Decent food, would've wanted a more complex broth but interested to see what else they have to offer. Their drinks look pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"This is the third time I've eaten there.  Always great service,food was served hot.  What I appreciate most is that they allow you to sit back and enjoy your meal and the company you are with."}
{"text":"The Clever Koi is a great go-to for an instant ramen fix. I ordered the chicken & waffle bun as a starter, which was incredibly unique and absolutely delicious. When it comes to the ramen, the pork ramen was good but didn't taste incredibly authentic or flavorful, which is why The Clever Koi isn't necessarily a 5 star restaurant in my book. However, the kitchen does a good job of giving the dishes their own spin, and I would definitely go back next time I'm in the mood for ramen."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by a coworker. I'm glad he told me about it, because being from Tempe, I don't get the chance to explore much of downtown Phoenix. We went for a late dinner on a Friday night. Luckily for us, it wasn't very busy, so we had no problem getting in right away. They have an open kitchen, so you can watch all sorts of neat dishes being made right in front of you. We chose to sit at the bar, and had a wonderful experience with the bartenders. We were given some recommendations for both drinks and food, and we were quite pleased with the choices we made (with the help of the bartender). They don't have a huge cocktail menu, but it will definitely satisfy your drinking desires. I had the Temperance Trap: gin, amaro, vanilla sugar and grapefruit bitter. I definitely recommend it; went perfectly with my kimchi fried rice. My boyfriend had the Enabler: 12yr Dickel with lemon juice, maple syrup & bitters. Tasty for all you whiskey lovers. We also had an order of the Massaman Curry, which is served with Udon noodles. The drinks were good, but I'd definitely say that their food is king here. Do yourself a favor and go with a big appetite!"}
{"text":"Love this casual little spot.  Food and service are excellent and consistently great. Nice outside patio and yummy drinks too!"}
{"text":"I was excited to experience CK due to the phenomenal reviews that I read. Unfortunately I didn't have the same experience. The one star I gave goes to the waiter because he was pretty good. My friend ordered the duck and a side of steak. I ordered the crab buns (not sure the official name) first off it took over 40 minutes for our food to come out (it wasn't busy) and when it did come out the duck was dry and the steak was cold. My friend told the runner that the steak was cold and she swiftly took it away and apologized. When said steak was brought back you could tell they popped it in the microwave and sprinkled some salt on top. No bueno. It went from medium to well done. Gross. As for my crab thingies, I just didn't care for the taste but other peeps might. First and last visit to CK. Oh, one thing I give them credit for was taking the dry duck off the bill. Thumbs up for that!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this place as it is literally up the street from my apartment.  The flavor of the broth on the Pork Ramen is very similar to my mom's cooking and it's just perfect!  Loved the soft shell crab they have as an appetizer and it taste similar at an authentic Chinese restaurant with slight alteration to the taste but still LOVE IT!!  I would go there at least once a week if not twice since I can be a little lazy to cook at home after coming home from work late.  I recommend this place to anyone.  The staff is amazing, they know my name, and always excellent service every time I am there!  :-)"}
{"text":"Holy sh!t this place is amazing. The food the atmosphere everything is done right! Congratulations great job!"}
{"text":"Super disappointing because the reviews were so high here. The food is 3 stars at best - low on the  average scale. Based on this alone I wouldn't recommend or come back. They have an incredibly limited menu and you choose your own noodle, broth, and what veggies to add into your bowl. Besides this there are 4 \"small bites\" options, and that's basically it. 
Service was awful even though there was no one in there at lunch time. No recommendations, no help. I asked for a Chardonnay that never came - so told whoever brought my food to cancel it. My server didn't come by until after I was done with my meal to say - oh hey sorry about that Chardonnay. So insincere and nasty I don't know why she bothered mentioning it at all. She still charged me for it so had to have it taken off. The bottle wasn't never opened or poured. 
I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great cocktails and food. Kenzie was the best server and had great recommendations on what to get. My new favorite place in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my mom took me because I was in the mood for sushi and she said she saw this cool Japanese restaurant driving home one day. We went, the waiter sat us and brought us some kind of grapefruit soda. The lunch menu was I guess different then the dinner menu there was no sushi at all. I was sad but still willing to try the one thing they did have on the lunch menu which was a build your own bowl and a appetizer. The appetizer took almost a good 20 min it was about the size of my palm maybe smaller it was terrible it was a waffle with a small piece of chicken and some kind of sweet and sour chili sauce the chicken was so incredible dry it wasn't edible and the waffle was so soggy! I love chicken and waffles but god damn what the hell were they trying to pull off. The waiter never came back after that, no one did...there was literally one other person in there eating and 4 waiters all tucked in a corner talking about I'm sure how hip they look cause that's all they were good for was being pretty the waiting was garbage. Finally 45 mins later our food came out and I'm not going to bore you with my description of how terrible this food was all I'll say is I swear someone used dirt as seasoning there wasn't a lick of flavor in me or my moms dishes. Wtf man my mom was trying to hunt down one of the 4 waiters 3 times the last time she had to stand up and wave her arms around. And finally one of the cooks came over all she wanted was some sauce to make what we ate a little more edible. Anyway 50 dollars was the total and it was 50 dollars down the toilet and a horrible celebratory lunch. I'm never coming back my moms never coming back and I'm not suggesting this place to anyone. Mad terrible"}
{"text":"Missed happy hour by five minutes, but food was still good. The portion size was okkkk...and you can tell something technical was done to simple foods to bring out the flavors. 

Soft crab bun was tasty but I couldn't get over the appearance of the crab in the bun... 

Duck bun was good. Would come again just for that.

Veggie plate was well seasoned but... $10!

Ramen was flavorful."}
{"text":"I went to Clever Koi on a Friday at 12:15p - we were seated right away, the host was very nice. It was not busy at all and the server took about 15 min to take our drink order, another 10 min to bring us water & placed our order. After placing our order we waited 30 minutes to get served. The 2 other tables waiting seemed very upset and no one ever apologized or explained what was taking so long! The food was very good but it's not worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The Clever Koi, has a great atmosphere to go along with their great food and beverages!  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Some of our favorites are the Turkey Wing, dumplings, and fried rice!!! YUMMY!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Incredible food, great staff.  Great experience.  Restaurant ambiance is great for hanging out.  Our group of friends hung out and drank and just talked and the staff took great care of us!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service, cool digs and new foods to enjoy , loved it . Server knows all menu items well ! Will be back."}
{"text":"Steamed Buns here are so, so GOOD! But this place is over priced beyond belief. The vibe is pretty cool. But after eating a steamed bun, and a bowl of pork ramen spending a total of $35 +tip. I wouldn't like to feel hungry anymore. (Just Saying)"}
{"text":"Yum!!! Neat interior, great service, excellent food. The place is cool inside, very contemporary with grays and browns. Feels more spacious than it is. Our waiter was upbeat and helpful with menu suggestions for those of us who hadn't been there. I asked another person who worked there if I was parked in the right place and he told me I wasn't but asked for my keys and offered to move it himself! I am pregnant, but still, that was above and beyond! And finally the food...wow. I am always a little skeptical of Asian places that mix different Asian cuisines, but I was wrong to be skeptical. Everything we had was amazing! Luckily we had a group of 5 women so we were able to try many things. We each ordered a steamed bun. I got one with tempura eggplant, tofu, basil, and aioli. The flavors together were amazing! We also tried a couple of dumplings, fried rice, and a noodle dish with broccoli, mushrooms, and a spicy cream sauce. Everything was so good, but that noodle dish was my favorite! I plan to bring my husband back here because, like me, he loves Asian food!"}
{"text":"Clever Koi exceeded my expectations! We made a reservation at 6:30 for 6 people on a Saturday night, and it was promptly ready as soon as our party arrived. Their drink selection was original, and our server provided great recommendations. 

The pork belly steam bun was absolutely sensational, I think when I go back I am going to order a bunch of them as a meal! I also had the dumplings, which we're spicy and had a very traditional feel. For an entree we got the fried chicken and it was lovely, the sauce that comes with it is delicious. 

They asked if we were celebrating anything, and we let the know that we had gotten engaged the day before and they brought out a fried banana ball (I have no idea what it's called) for each person in our party!

They made our experience lovely, and I'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere really livens old town Gilbert. Brings a new energy to the seasoned spots. 

Food is uhh-mazing!

Pick face dumplings
Red miso seared Kobe 
Tuna chips
Fried forbidden black rice 
Kimchi fried rice 

All on point -- full of flavor -- leaves you wanting more. 

Riding the pine is a great drink choice as well! 

Try it out -- dinner at least :-)"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I really like the Clever Koi. The ambiance is perfect, the staff is friendly, and the food is good. This place wants to be 5 stars...it's begging for it, but there are some things missing. #1 SAUCE. Something as simple as that would make this place 5 stars. Everything was delicious but needed that extra ounce of optional saturation to make it great. Duck buns, bok choy dumplings and the fried rice were all good. Also, the chairs in this plae are hard to move around, ESP at the bar, and make a ton of noise. Those little chair leg felt pieces would do this place wonders. Other than those small details, this place is awesome.

Overall, definitely give this place a try. The Clever Koi is so close to 5 stars, you may almost believe it is."}
{"text":"I've ordered twice now from Clever Koi through UberEats and both times have left me underwhelmed. Every once in awhile I crave broth based soups. When I want Ramen I generally go to Umami in Tempe but if I'm working at my desk I can't always drive over there. So I tried Clever Koi.

My first round with CK was pork based broth and ramen noodles. It was OK, not amazing, the broth had a unique flavor and the order of Sriracha I got with it, helped pump up the flavor.

The second round I ordered Dashi broth and udon noodles with mushrooms, snow peas and shrimp. The shrimp and mushrooms tasted off. Like the mushrooms were canned and the shrimp should've been served yesterday. Everything was incredibly bland, it lacked in any seasoning and I had to add salt to the entire dish to even get anything to pop. This time I didn't order Sriracha and I really should have. I had a small packet of Cholula in my desk and added that to the soup and it helped. I had a co-worker order a rice bowl with the lemongrass chicken and she said it was \"two thumbs up.\" So maybe if you're looking for a rice bowl hit up Clever Koi, but I've officially called off the soup orders from them."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place out. From the second we walked in the door we were greeted and seated within 15 min for a saturday night. A very nice guy was working the room. The staff was very knowledgeable and had some great recommendations. So here you go! The pig face dumplings were delicious, pork ramen and the cocktails are on point.  Amazing food and even better service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time here and most likely last.

Pros:
- I got to spend nearly two hours with my family.

Cons:
- Took over 40-minutes for the food to come out. Only one other group was there...
- About 10 people working and none of them helped. We had to ask for refills multiple times.
- We had 4 different servers and none of them were competent.
- The last two beers we got were from the bottom of the barrel and were chunky.
- My water smelt like wet dog?.... I love dogs and know what this smells like!

Bad bad service."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now. I tried the pork belly ramen and the broth was lacking flavor. The duck curry is more like a curry soup with udon noodles and potatoes. It barely has any duck. There might have been 3 tiny slivers of duck. It was overly spicy and very disappointing. The Angry hen was gross. It had a sweet and sour sauce on it and came with a cold sweet pear chutney on the side. 

On the contrary, the pork belly bun was great. Also, the dumplings were also very good. The non alcoholic drinks with bitters were also good."}
{"text":"We walked in on a busy Wednesday night, and there was no wait for a table. 

Food: We ordered the Chinese long beans, pork belly bun, soft shell crab bun, the duck fat wings, and the corn dumplings to start. I'm a pork belly fan, and that bun was wrapped around the most delectable slab of pork I've had in a while. The long beans were beautifully presented, and delicious. The wings weren't as spicy as anticipated, but were tender and tasty. Entrees all around were the pork belly ramen, and again, the pork belly was perfectly done. Ramen broth had great flavor.

Service: Attentive. The person that took our order never came back, but our water glasses were filled throughout the meal, and staff checked in on us as they delivered the food. 

Cost: Well-priced for the food they offer. 

Overall: Would happily come back and try other dishes we missed out on in this trip."}
{"text":"We go here a few times a year to get lunch, dinner and late night cocktails. It's small but it has a nice atmosphere. The drinks are awesome but their food is a hit or miss. Tonight, we had the crispy pineapple duck and lemon pepper chicken ramen. The crispy pineapple duck dish was too oily for us. If it was served with rice, it would reduced the oily taste. As for the lemon pepper chicken, the broth was salty. It needed more daikon or bean sprouts to lessen the salty flavor."}
{"text":"Went to the clever koi had pad thai with tofu, mom had the noodles and shrimp, and my sister had the cauliflower ramen. The appetizer was black bean pancake, and brussel sprouts and mushrooms. Everything was really delicious. I would recommend this place. It is  trendy with nice music a great service. Most important of all great great food."}
{"text":"I was there a week ago, service was good apps were good the noodle bowls a little salty but ok. I got the peach fritter and was disappointed it was like a donut hole but too dense and just a speck of peach. A peach fritter should be easy here is a suggestion how to do make it if you have not already fixed it,  use fresh peaches probable from costco, cut into wedges, dust with cornstarch and use a tempura batter made with peach nectar and a little vanilla  I hope this helps and good luck with a great concept"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! WONDERFUL SERVICE! BEAUTIFUL atmosphere! Dinner and cocktails with my neighbor/friend. The food-EXCELLENT! We had the calamari app-OMG!!! I had filet of sole curry on a bed of brown rice with Mexican squash...YASS! Seemed robust and busy initially-we had a reservation, but it was quite nice.  Can be romantic spot, there is also the patio.  I LOVED the service, TOO!  My dish had a few substitutions and the waitress was right on it.  Drinks were DELICIOUS as well. I LOVE this place! New twist on Asian food, check."}
{"text":"Since it was our first time we listened to the suggestions from our friends and went with the pork belly buns, soft shell crab buns, pad tai, and ramen bowls. Everything was extremely flavorful,  and we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from Austin, Texas and stumbled upon this place ... all I can say is OMG!!!!! 

The flavors, the presentation, the vibe ... EVERYTHING about this place is uber cool and  culinarily orgasmic! We sat at the bar and watched our bar tender, Gavin, who was one of the mixologists of the drinks they serve do his thing ... he is a master of his craft and made our visit quite the experience.

One of the very BEST culinary experiences I've had EVER ... 

Whenever I come to Phoenix from this day forward, this will be a \"must\" stop location going forward ... wow! 

Going to go back to eating again ... hmmmm. I am one happy camper! 

Oh, I am adding to this when one of the owners came out to check to see how everything was and surprised us with a killer dessert:

Banana fritters with Sesame ice cream and honey lavender ice cream with a side of misou caramel sauce which again was OMG!!!! 

Do yourself the favor of experiencing the Clever Koi! You'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food was incredible, in taste and in presentation. The server was very knowledgeable, friendly, and fun. The place itself is very cool in design. All around fantastic."}
{"text":"I practically live next door and have been eagerly awaiting for it to open. I came here today specifically as an end to my Small Business Saturday.
There are all ready so many great places in Central and Downtown Phoenix, but they're all either Mexican, burgers and salads or pizza. This is such a welcome and refreshing change to that line-up. From the moment I entered to the moment I left, service was spot-on. It was friendly, personable, the staff was knowledgable, I couldn't  have asked for or expected better.
The same with the food. It was seriously one of the best meals I have ever had. I started with a single steamed bun with duck. It was so good. I contemplated ordering 2-3 more and just making that my meal. Since it was my first time there, I figured I'd try something else for my entree though. I had the chicken katzu rice bowl. WOW! Such a unique flavor.  I cannot wait to go back and drag everyone I know with me."}
{"text":"Just ate here for a friend's birthday tonight- lots to say. 

Food: The food menu is not nearly as long as the beverage menu, which wouldn't have been a big deal (because they have AWESOME options) if I wasn't vegetarian and my friend a vegan. For such a trendy place I was expecting to have more than a couple options, but I made do and what I got was great. I think my dish was $12, and most plates were in the $11-$16 arena.

Drinks: The restaurant is owned by two guys with a lot of bar experience, and I hypothesize that the Clever Koi was originally a bar concept that was born a restaurant. They have a large selection of beers including a group of drafts on tap. Then, they have a long list of upgraded classic cocktails. THEN, they have a menu of probably... 20 specialized creations that are to die for. There are some wine options as well. Our drinks were delicious and instagram-friendly via complementary garnish/glass presentation. Win-win. It's important to include that you're looking at $8-$15 a cocktail. 

Ambiance: SO COOL. The architectural design of the restaurant is admirable and inviting. Loads of natural light via window-walls. We were there in the evening, and the artificial lighting is perfectly done. Romantic, warm, and intimate. The styling is contemporary, and the bar is plotted in such a way that it almost creates its own exclusive space in the restaurant- my friends and I agreed that we would readily come back just for drinks. 

Service: The owner came over to our table and spoke casually with us as we waited for the rest of our party. He was informative about the restaurant foundations in a very humble way, that made me feel very valuable as a customer. Our waiter also was kind, humble, and attentive. We had some less favorable staff interactions, which really is the only reason I couldn't give 5/5 stars. That and some inproportionally priced items on the menu (dumplings, small plates + certain cocktails).

Overall, a great dining experience. As a vegetarian, I probably wont come back for a meal, but I'll definitely be back for drinks!

OMG I almost forgot- their banana fritters are to die for. I don't care if you don't like bananas or never get dessert- you MUST get an order to share with your table."}
{"text":"My husband and I have dined here several times for lunch but it was our first visit for dinner for my dad's birthday. We had previously perused the dinner menu so we were excited to try some of the new dishes. 

We started with the crudite which was a nice assortment of veggies; radish, beets, snow peas, asparagus, etc. It came with a sesame tzatziki sauce which was yummy! We also tried the duck croquettes with roasted beets. My Dad's words: \"where has this been all my life?!\" Super tasty. Appetizers arrived quickly.

There was a slight delay for our entrees but this was around 8:00 on a Friday for our six top. We had a few gluten free dishes which the manager accommodated and delivered personally.

The Mushroom Ramen was amazing as was the Pork Belly. I always appreciate the homemade Sriracha to spice up my bowl.

Overall this was a great choice for my family dinner. As I said it was a busy Friday night so it was a tad loud inside. Their patio is amazing though if you're looking for a more relaxing ambiance. They had heavy duty misters running to keep it cool outdoors.

Definitely need to visit for dinner more often. The variety of dishes left us all debating our choices for a good 15 minutes. I would absolutely order the mushroom Ramen again, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I understand it's Asian fusion restaurant. I tried their special which was the Korean fried chicken. It was no where similar or even close to the original Korean fried chicken taste. 
I also ordered the Black fried rice. It was very odd tasting and very bland."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience for a birthday dinner. The food, craft cocktails and service were spot on. Some of our favorites were the calamari fries, pineapple duck and the salmon. Full bar and great happy hour. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I love ramen and this place is close to home, so have it a shot. First, steamed buns were awesome!! Tropical black tea was great. Green tea was just green colored water. I ordered the pork ramen and my bf ordered the vegetarian ramen. It came out and pretty instantly we knew it was going to be sub par. The noodles tasted like they were opening up ramen packs in the back. The broth was very generic and tasted like it was dumped from a can 10 minutes earlier. The egg had no flavor. His vegetation broth had a burnt plastic taste to it. $60 later and we left pretty unhappy. The ambiance, the service and the cleanliness was on point. But won't be returning. We'll keep going to Tampopo Ramen in Tempe."}
{"text":"Came Here Fathers Day Afternoon. The Ambiance is quite enjoyable and I noticed the place was exceptionally clean! My OCD can now rest quietly! The servers were attentive, accessible and down to earth. My kind of place. The drinks were wonderful and the strength pleasantly surprising. The food was delicious and I look forward to trying more options from both the kitchen and bar. Definitely a nice place to enjoy quality food, drinks, service and let me note; the temperature and noise level were just perfect. Ill be back Clever Koi! They were even attentive to my 17 month old, bringing him water and fresh orange slices! A pleasurable experience indeed.

Koi Burger, Fries, Chicken & Waffle Bun, Rabbit Dumplings, All Delicious!"}
{"text":"It's not just about amazing food - The Clever Koi has become an important spot for midtown & for Phoenix. The chefs and owners came from The Parlor, another institution but the Clever Koi also sources local produce and adjusts the menu by season. The food & cocktails are highly inventive, to say it is Asian Fusion\" isn't really right - they do their own thing. Being on the lightrail and next to the repurposed community Park, The Clever Koi is on the map & so is midtown."}
{"text":"Before writing this review, I've been to Clever Koi about four times. The first time was with a group of Asians, the other was to impress a friend from California, and another was because it became my go-to restaurant to catch up with an old friend. The fourth time I went with 10 people from the crew and that's where the fun happens.

Overall, if you want good, yet unique food at a central place in Phoenix, this is a great place to get your Asian fix. There are a lot of very trendy restaurants around this area but I have not found a better Asian one than this one. You can really feel the \"hip-ness\" of the place, with its contrasting blue bar fighting with the orange, elegant dining room. 

To iterate, the restaurant was made by three not-Asian owners which is perfectly ok. As much as I would love to judge authenticity, this place isn't authentic Asian food but it doesn't have to be. This place has great food and because Asian flavors are so unique and flavorful, I can see why they decided to go with an Asian inspired restaurant.

When waiting for a seat, enjoy the visually pleasing cook books that are placed near the front of the restaurant. They have nothing to do with the food, but they are a good read.

I've eaten the steamed buns, the ramen, the duck curry and the seafood soup over the course of the three times I've been there. I can remember food very easily if it's truly exceptional.

Let me tell you, these guys nail pork belly so well. In both their buns and their ramen, their pork belly is textured on the outside and melty on your inside. Weird descriptions, but this is necessary for this type of pork belly. You want the outside to have a roasted feel and the inside to melt in your mouth. Think of it as really Asian bacon, but with a different goal: an amazing texture."}
{"text":"Had the pig face dumplings, pho appetizer (pictures), something Swizzle drink (pictured), and another random drink. 

The pig face dumplings are among the best things I've ever eaten. Want. More. Now. The Swizzle drink might be the best cocktail I've ever had. The other stuff was good, but yo, the pig face dumplings and Swizzle drink were such , efff everything else. 

Anyways I like the Clever Koi & recommend it to everyone. If you don't like it, then you're probably a jerk with a dumb jerk face. Don't be a #JerkFace."}
{"text":"Great food ! Unique dishes , good for sharing!  It was a fun little spot for my sister's birthday."}
{"text":"The soft shell crab bun is AWESOME. All the menu items rock. They have noodles and rice and good beer. Great atmosphere    
They always have the same staff. That's a sign of a top notch restaurant. Shout out to the kitchen, for all the hard work!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim with some friends for happy hour.  Best happy hour I've been to in a long time.  Started with the chicken wings done Asian style with kimchi and bamboo shoots to garnish.  Very delicious by itself but add the kimchi ranch and it's darn near perfect.  Next up pork ramen with bacon, mustard spiced greens and an egg (I opted to have the shiitake left out a very nice touch that they could do that). The bowl arrives and at first scent I am intrigued to try more. The ramen was cooked perfectly, the egg poached with the right amount of tenderness in the yolk, the pork was think cut but a little too fatty for my liking, the broth so invigorating but it had a spice that I could not place.  This dish is a culinary delight.  And at $5 for happy hour price, just perfect. 

The restaurant itself is a very modern industrialish ambiance.  The decor had just the right amount of Asian influence without it slapping you in the face at every turn.  The wait staff was very friendly and eager to treat you as if you were the only patron in the place.  Complimentary valet is available."}
{"text":"Get the spicy seafood ramen! Sooo good! It has a nice smoky, hot flavor! Love the ambience of the place too"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant everything from the foods that was there to the atmosphere. It's Asian fusion cuisine and they do a marvelous job. The cocktails are amazing as well. I tried to go here as fast as I can. The last time I had Softshell crab and it was delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant over and over!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a LOVELY Date Night at Clever Koi Gilbert  last night. They brought us complimentary champagne to wish us well on our date, we enjoyed a scorpion bowl for two that had a flaming lime in the center, and had some oh so delicious food. My forbidden fried rice was amazing and so flavorful, and my husband loved his spicy seafood hot pot. We got short rib dumplings, which were different and tasty, and we always love the ahi tuna chips! It was nice to go out to an \"adult\" restaurant and enjoy our time together. Thank you Clever Koi for a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  However, it was overpriced.  Parking was tight in the back with many people parking on the street. Not for me."}
{"text":"I love Ramen so I have to try the new restaurant in downtown Gilbert. I had the pork Ramen, it wasn't my favorite but was okay. I love the decor inside the restaurant and friendly service. The bar menu was impressive. It's a little pricey for Ramen but than again you're in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Very memorable and has become a new craving. Had their ramen and cognac cocktail: so.much.yum. Can't wait to go back a few more times while still in the area. So amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Good quality food and drinks are pretty good too. We go here for date nights or just with friends to hang and have a good time. Kids friendly as well."}
{"text":"I really really like this place. The food is absolutely unique and well-crafted. The staff are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet and offer helpful suggestions and have great knowledge of the menu. I got the pig face dumplings and crafted my own Udon noodle bowl with pork broth mushrooms bok choy and bean sprouts and it was absolutely fantastic. The ambience is really cool and modern with an ultrachic vibe that I love."}
{"text":"I just visited there again and used to go frequently, they have changed their lunch menu and it's a bit disappointing.  You used to get to make your own bowls but no more and the prices have gone up considerably.  Do yourself a favor guys and go back to the old lunch menu."}
{"text":"This place is quaint and has a fun little vibe.

I had wanted to try this place out for a while and we finally got the chance.  They don't take reservations for small parties so we had to show up and put our name in.  We were able to go next door to the wine bar to wait for a table so we were able to grab a drink.  They came and got us when it was ready.

We tried a few things on the menu to get a sense of the food.  I have to admit, it fell flat.  The Peking duck croquettes were decent and the pork belly bun was tasty.  The pig face dumpling wasn't that great, nor was the chicken/waffle bun.  The szechuan peppercorn beef was kind of bland.  The drinks we had weren't bad.  The server was friendly but disappeared after the food was delivered.

Overall, it was ok.  If friends were meeting for happy hour I would probably come back but other than that I don't see myself making a specific trip."}
{"text":"Wanted to like Clever Koi more than I did, and maybe I'm a bit too picky regarding Asian fusion and certain flavors, but my dish was only... alright, and my tablemate's dish was insanely, INSANELY salty, nearly to the point of inedibility. (I believe she had the tofu kimchi fried rice, but I don't remember exactly.)

We had a couple other misses that night: dishes that had potential but whose specific execution made them a bit too strong in one direction and not well-rounded or enjoyable as full meals, and the place was slammed so service was a bit slow.

I had the Chicken Katsu, which was alright, but the nori was a bit off-putting next to fried chicken for me. Typically a meal I'm not crazy about would net a 3 star, but three out of four of us were unimpressed overall, and my friends are nowhere near as picky as I am. They just didn't love the specific executions they were served."}
{"text":"All employees are Hipster douchers and super average food.

Not sure how this place is getting even decent reviews. Pricey too.

Wings were the best thing. 

The Ramen was inedible for sure. Tasted super bland with dry meat like pot roast.

Soft shell crab sandwich was fishy as hell and tiny.

This place will not last. Much better food to be had within 100ft

Thafuk?"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite spots! I have been to this restaurant three times, but I never ordered the right thing. Finally, I found a dish that I absolutely love and will keep coming back for the Lemon Pepper Chicken Ramen.  It is so simple, but has so much flavor in the chicken broth. I recommend adding the red chili sauce they provide on the table. Just remember a little goes a long way! 

One dish I don't recommend is the Kimchi Fried Rice. I was very underwhelmed and ended up eating off of everyone else's dish except mine! Ha! 

Drinks are spectacular! I really enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching the mixologists make the drinks. They put so much thought and effort into each drink. It really is like an art! Riding the Pine St. was my favorite drink so far. I tried to make it on my own at home... but didn't even come close to theirs."}
{"text":"Great quick lunch downtown. Ramen done right... Definitely not what you made yourself in college."}
{"text":"Was in the area on business and saw some good yelp reviews. I have a hard time finding decent Asian  restaurants in town, so I headed on over. It's kind of hard to find, stuck in the middle of a tight sort of modern strip mall type structure, but there is plenty of parking in the back. I circled twice...I wasn't giving up  easy!

Glad I did. 

The menu was very different, you picked what protein, what vegetable, etc. All a la carte. Really nice actually, and good options. I picked lemon chicken, carrots, mushrooms and snow peas. Added pickled ginger on the side. I had it with brown fried rice-which I told waiter I was concerned about being too tough-as it often is. He said they used small pearl rice, and it was no problem-so I went with it. Glad I did!

When it came, piping hot, I was so anxious from the aromas emanating I mixed the lovely plate all up before I thought to take a pic-so the presentation is great-I messed it up!

The chicken came cut in long, thin, perfectly cooked tender slices. There was no obvious sauce, but lord the taste was fantastic! I devoured this in record time.

Wait staff was very nice and professional. A very comfortable yet trendy atmosphere. I told her I would for SURE be back, bringing a friend to try it too-even though I'm a 40 minute drive away.  THAT'S how yummy it was. 

I took a pic of the interior too, it's small, not super fancy but very hip. I liked it-overall-  very much."}
{"text":"Amazing food, drinks, ambiance, and service. Everything was above expectations. The octopus small plate was the most tender I've ever had and a great mix of flavors and textures. Also had the spicy seafood hot pot, rabbit dumplings, and a great gin cocktail."}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing! The drinks are great and I was really impressed with the food. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for a relaxing time to hang out with friends or family."}
{"text":"This spot is so cute. Lovely ambiance inside, open kitchen, and great outdoor area as well. Perfect for a date! Or dinner with friends which is why I went. They are known for their ramen! I got the shaking beef dish, wok cooked filet cuts over arugula, tomato & onion with a yuzu dressing. It was SO GOOD. The beef was so flavorful, and cooked very very well. I would definitely order it again. My friend next to me ordered the pork ramen and it looked amazing! The service was excellent. All of their cocktails looked so well put together, very picture worthy. Everyone in my group was satisfied with their meals."}
{"text":"This dining EXPERIENCE was a memorable one for my corporate group dinner this week. The food speaks for itself. The open kitchen creates a vibe. The employees are not only welcoming, truly attentive creative sorts, you can tell they are actually having fun working there.

The co-owner Nick treated us so well! He talked to us about the inspiration and care and passion around creating a true experience beyond just having dinner. 

A true gem in the area. We ordered a little of everything and everyone was wow-ed."}
{"text":"This place is nice and hip. The customer service is outstanding and the noodles are delicious. I really liked the drinks, we had the tropical ice tea and grapefruit soda and it was delicious. I just wish they would put a bit more broth in the bowls; other than that this place is really good."}
{"text":"We were so excited to go since we had read great reviews. My husband's birthday was coming up so about 12 of us showed up. We were so disappointed with the food! Omg everything we ordered was under seasoned... seriously no one in our party ordered something they liked. I personally ordered the pas thai... how can someone mess up pad thai? The tamarind sauce usually makes some tanginess come out... but, nothing! Added lemon and salt and made some little taste come out of nothing. We even returned some of the plates with no desire in ordering more. For being downtown Gilbert on a Saturday night you would think the place would be packed, but now I understand why it wasn't. Plus, the service was mediocre... it seemed as if we were bothering the waitress when we needed something. Also, we couldn't pay separately... only options given were to pay even amounts on different cards. It would have to be a miracle if we all had the same amount on each of our bills..."}
{"text":"Really cool trendy space, tons of interesting drink options with a friendly staff. Thought the food was mediocre at best. Nothing knocked me off my feet as I was expecting. Tried the shrimp dumplings, tuna chips (actually very delicious with the guac) duck croquettes were over cooked and rocky. pork bun and chicken and waffle bun were decent. The restaurant has a cool vibe however I would return for that reason"}
{"text":"If you are going strictly for the quality of food and have an unlimited amount of time to spend- then this restaurant is awesome. 
However, of you have anything else to do in a day, maybe you'd want to go some place else. 
I believe we were forgotten about; sat at our table without being checked on for 40 minutes. When I asked if we could have our lunch to go because we needed to get back to work, it still took another 20 plus minutes for that to happen. I believe that they forgot to put in our order until I asked to make it to go. There was never an apology; I'm sorry that took so long, we messed up, or anything.. that is disappointing - as I am empathic to being busy and making mistakes- everyone is human and the food is good. 
But due to their lack of awareness, empathy or basic customer service; and borderline annoyance of being asked about the side order of kimchi (we were told it was in the ramen bowl, but not visible), I (nor the friends I was with) will not be going back to this establishment."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has only 4 stars!
It's the real deal. Drinks were awesome! Prices reasonable. And food was \"WOW\" factor. Like literally every bite was great! Must taste for yourself."}
{"text":"We had a double date for Restaurant Week...2 of us tried the RW menu and the other 2 ordered from the standard menu. We thought this would be a good way to try multiple dishes.

PROS
Pig face dumplings! Juicy, crispy on the bottom and the table was a fan of the spicy kimchi.
The Kobe app - very tasty with the mushrooms, super buttery protein and cooked just right.
My friend liked her forbidden rice dish, she didn't get any protein with it just veggies, she esp liked the bok choy
I ordered the crispy duck, delish rice cake and pineapple puree as the sauce, veggies were just how I liked that all charred but still crunchy

CONS
I ordered a glass of the Tempranillo, server came back and gave me other options. 
Banana fritters were not really fritters, they were more donut holes/beignet style, it could have been cooked a little more, too gooey for me
Skimped on sauces in the dishes

We enjoyed our meal and our time at Clever Koi, we look forward to trying their HH if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Love their Tuesday and Wednesday deal where you can get 4 cocktails and 2 entrees for $50! We went for an early dinner to their new location in Gilbert (have been to the Phx location) and ordered our cocktails (aviation/french 75/Manhattans) and service was quick with generous pours from the bartender.

I ordered the duck confit with rice cakes and hubby ordered a noodle seafood soup. The duck was cooked where it was still moist and not dry at all. The dishes were very flavorful and we enjoyed the modern take on Asian cuisine. He didn't finish the soup so it was fine for lunch the next day. We loved the space and style of the restaurant as it is way less claustrophobic than the Phoenix location. Looking forward to dining here again."}
{"text":"A must try spot in the booming downtown Gilbert food Mecca. Happy hour was great with tons of variety to choose from and drink that go down super easy and hit you hard once you stand up! Just the way I like them  
Service was good, our server gave lots of great suggestions and was always checking in. 
The spot itself is a bit small and of you have a larger group call ahead. 

Excited to go back and try a few more items that caught my eye."}
{"text":"It was my first time with my friends there at Clever Koi. We were there around 8:30 pm. We were a bit scared to be rushed by the staff because they close at 9 pm. However that wasn't the case at all. All the staffs at Clever Koi was super nice. 

The food was very delicious.
They were prepared carefully and decorated beautifully.
I ordered pork belly bun, calamari fries and the blackened fried rice 
I tried two drinks. They both were good but the favorite one of mine was The Enabler"}
{"text":"One of my go to spots! The food is always amazingly flavorful and consistent. It has a very upbeat atmosphere and always good vibes. The people are always awesome and go above and beyond to make sure your experience is great. For the food, it's hard for me to try new things once I've found something that I love, I usually have the lemon pepper chicken ramen and it's so delicious. I also recommend the steamed buns...let me just say these buns are incredible. I order the pork belly buns but I substitute the pork for chicken, and they are so good. My husband likes to adventure out and order new things, this last time he tried the forbidden black rice bowl with chicken instead of shrimp...he said it's his new favorite. I almost forgot...Drinks! The drinks are impressive, I had the French 95 and my husband had an old fashion.  He's very critical on his drinks, and says the old fashions are one of the best in town. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"If you don't like this place then you are insane or you have simply been in Phoenix too long. I am so glad that this place is in our area and it is exactly what Phoenix needs to take our restaurant scene in a different direction.

The menu is very eclectic and you can explore some great flavorful options.
Salt and pepper shrimp and pig face dumplings are amazing. 
Then try any of the bowls. The beef is my favorite. 
The staff are super friendly and they are very passionate about the place."}
{"text":"The highlight of our meal was the pork belly steamed buns. The overall presentation was nice and the food looked tasty. However we have tried better. My boyfriend was let down by the pad Thai. We also had the confit wings and zesty noodles. If we ever decide to go back, I may just try the ramen. 3 stars overall."}
{"text":"Great spot. Super friendly and great service. Unique twist on Asian cuisine. Worth a try if you want a cool spot with buns, noodles, ramen, and more"}
{"text":"Clever Koi is best!!! I've been here once a week for the past couple weeks and I can honestly say it gets better every time. Everything is amazing...ambience, service, food. I recommend sitting at the bar where the chefs are preparing the food rather than a table. What an awesome interactive experience. We order something different every time and I've never had anything that wasn't incredible, both in presentation and taste. I love this place because of how unique and fun the experience is and I leave feeling beyond satisfied. Always a pleasure, already looking forward to next time!"}
{"text":"Highly overrated.  Very disappointed by this much hyped restaurant.  Had the corn dumping which were awesome so we were hopeful.  Cocktails on \"happy hour special\" were $10 each, not very happy as they were just adequate. Dinner was salmon and forbidden rice bowl. Salmon was overcooked but had a  good flavor. Rice bowl was not great.  It was very salty and had 3 pieces of shrimp.  The bowl at Flower Child is less money and much more flavorful"}
{"text":"Great new establishment in downtown Phoenix area. Asian cuisine with a modern twist,  Trendy decor inside and nice patio as well. We grab two seats up at the kitchen bar eating area and were able to watch them cooking etc. The beat salad was ahhh-mazz-inngg ! I wanted to order a second one but I contained myself. I also had some shrimp with my salad and I thoroughly enjoyed both of them. We ordered a bottle of sake as well and finished the whole damn thing before we even finished eating :)

Service was on point, food was exactly what i expected when i ordered it. Decent affordable prices as well.

Try it out!"}
{"text":"I don't know how many times I've been here. But I can say that, if i want a spicy bowl of vegetarian Ramen noodles. BOOM. here!!!!!!!! Yummm. 
The soup was thick, but still tasteful on a cold weather *happy face *
I love the ambiance and love the patio outside. 
Customer services is what they lack on... but overall I love this place.

Parking is a pain, but make sure you read the signs. Or else your car will get towed.

My mom said get the duck ramen..haha. she loved that.

I shall be back!"}
{"text":"6.3 stars. 
Pad that was very good.  The Pork belly with rice was phenomenal, perfectly cooked and seasoned and presented.m.  Definitely best I ever had.  The Peking duck croquettes were also amazingly delicous.  We also tried the Bahn Mi all the glaciers and they were very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Daisy, our waitress, provided excellent service and the food was very good.  The cuisine is Asian Fusion and it's definitely more refined than at the average Thai or Chinese place."}
{"text":"This is a really modern, clean, and small place on Central in down town Phoenix. If you are not looking for it you won't see it. We went for Happy Hour. The service was attentive and the food was a wonderful surprise. It's Asian influenced with some creative twists. It is fresh and the flavors made me smile. We had the smoked and grilled vegetables with flat steak that was a perfect medium rare. It came with two dipping sauces, one sweet and a pesto. We also had edamame fritters, and some Raman Soup. Everything was perfect. Parking as with most downtown places is by complimentary valet."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes!

Not inexpensive. But, every item is exceptionally presented and really tasty.

Pig face dumplings (get over the name) were moist, well seasoned, artfully plated and simply yummy.

Pork ramen was huge. Great broth. Noodles were just right, not too firm. Interesting mix of veggies in the broth.

Wood grilled short rib. Very tender. A bit on the fatty side. 

Banana bread a-la foster for dessert. Very unique.

Service was very attentive. It seemed like everyone was helping to wait on every table.

Happy!"}
{"text":"This place is just awesome! I've only been to Clever Koi twice and so far, for both visits it had been great experiences. We went at night and sat outside for both visits. I prefer sitting outside because of the nice breeze from the high fans. You can also hear the light rail and few cars pass but overall its not too loud and just right. Inside of the restaurant  has a good touch up of trendy Asian interior. I find the place just perfect. 

We ordered the calamari fries which was very good! It was tasty with a nice hint of lime.  You can actually taste the calamari unlike other restaurants where you can mostly taste what its breaded in rather than the calamari itself. I tried something new and ordered the spicy seafood hot pot. The broth was savory and the spice was just right with thick udon noodles. 

We got the same server as last time and as usual service was outstanding. He was very informative with every questions we had about the menu. He checked up on us a couple times and ensured everything was good. Our server was friendly and gave us good suggestions on what to order. 

Clever Koi is hidden but definitely worth the place to be checked out if you want to try something new. It's a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent meal and very nice ambiance.  My fiance and I ate on the patio.  We started with a special grilled octopus appetizer which was good.  He had the wood grilled octopus.  That was amazing!  Such a wonderful broth, and the seasonings were delicious.  

He also had an old fashioned which was made well.  

For dinner I had the seasonal vegetable plate.  The yams were perfect.  He had the pork ramen with gluten free noodles.  This is wonderful for him with his gluten allergy.

For dessert I had the chocolate pudding.  I really did not care for it at all, too sweet and not much flavor.

Overall, a wonderful place.  We will go back!"}
{"text":"So I'm trying to be a douche and park at George & Dragon, because I hate all things valet (it's complimentary, you just have to pay for it!) The valet sees me and is all, \"Hey, are you going to Clever Koi? You can't park there.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, you just assumed I'm going to Clever Koi?* Where do you get off, buddy?\"** But yeah, those sneaky buggers will totally corner you into valeting, tail betwixt legs.

*I said literally none of this.
**I silently complied. 

Moving on, it's happy hour. I order only full-priced drinks because I don't understand money. Fill Collins and Slippin' Jimmy are both exceptional, and I would've drank more if I didn't have to go to another thing to drink more after. The server, noticing our enthusiasm (and dashing good looks) recommended we sit at the bar and get creative with the bartender, which is 100% on for next time.

Edible portion: 
- Highlight was also not an HH offering - chicken and waffles, featuring taco'd waffle filled with saucy chicken.  
- Blood orange chicken wangs: sounds more creative than it is. Saltier than expected and served with ranch, you get three full bird arms in an artsy little stack. A great option for your friend who wishes you were at Pei Wei and a sports bar.
- Yams o'brien: cubes of Japanese sweet potato with sriracha aoli, also much more normal than I had in mind. It's a fun and easy activity to mindlessly eat the whole bowl, but not essential. 
- Seasonal vegetable plate with steak: maybe I hate Spring, or vegetables, but the asparagus, beets, and kimchi didn't really do it for me. I liked the yams, but I'd already eaten like, 14 cups of yam by this point. I would pass on this in favor of several more chicken waffles next time. 
- Honorable mention: server candy! Man buns, septum piercings, gauges, and tattoos galore. The waiters were 104% more fun to look at than the guests.

5 stars cocktailery & server candy, 3.5 star food. Come for happy hour, stay for the other stuff."}
{"text":"The Clever Koi is it. The true 5 star restaurant. My husband and I have been here twice and we both agree it is truly our favorite restaurant in the Valley.

Location is awesome. While parking is not the best (most spaces are \"reserved\" for George and Dragon patrons only), we always have managed to find a spot fairly easily. If not, they always have valet available. 

Ambiance is fantastic. Love how it's decorated, the interior design and lighting are great.

Service? Some of the best I've ever experienced. David has been our server both times and I cannot say enough wonderful things about him. He's so friendly, attentive, and incredibly knowledgeable about not only the food menu, but the drinks as well. He can explain every single ingredient of the drink menu to you, from chartreuse to Pimm's to anything else you may not know. If I've had a sweeter, more genuine server, I cannot remember when it was. He remembered us from our first foray in and made sure to say goodnight to us as we left (and let us know the new menu would be coming out soon, yes!). The general manager (who has been there both times we have) is always super friendly as well, running food and always making sure everyone's happy. The bussers are great too (waters were always kept full) and the place runs like a well oiled machine.

Drinks were awesome. My husband ordered one that ended up being fairly strong, so David came by and did a few revisions to it, making it absolutely delicious. I had the Temperance Trap (awesome), one of my girlfriends had the Paloma (also awesome), and another friend had the homemade Green Apple soda (a special for the night), which he loved.

Okay, so now onto the food.

Ohhhh, the food.

Blue Lake Green Beans. Every person at the table said the same thing (both times): \"how can you make green beans taste THIS good?\" Answer from David: the woodfire grill, of course. Apparently in the winter there are brussel sprouts instead of green beans, so I can't wait for it to get chilly again!

Things I didn't eat but was told were amazing: the chicken and waffles and  pork belly steamed buns, pork ramen, chicken ramen, and chicken chow mein. All six of us last night were \"mmmm\"ing through the meal. 

Both times, I've ordered the vegetable chow mein with tofu. So. So. So good. The tofu is cooked on the woodfire grill, the vegetables (especially the mushrooms) are marinated in some blend of spices that are so delicious that one of my fellow diners had to try some out of another's bowl. 

For dessert... well, we went a bit dessert crazy. David let us know there were a few new desserts: a chocolate pudding with a cashew nougat and a citrus soft serve, in addition to the bananas foster fritters. It was my husband's birthday so we thought \"what the hell\" and ordered all three. And I am so glad we did, because they were all delicious. 

Throughout the meal David came by to ask us how everything was, to chit chat with us and make sure we knew he was available. We absolutely loved talking with him and appreciated so much that we knew he wasn't too busy for us (even though he was definitely busy!). 

I can't say enough good things about Clever Koi. Now I can't wait for the new menu to come out, so we have another excuse to go visit!"}
{"text":"Well, first off- this whole eat your soup with chopsticks thing is harder than it looks! But, I gave it a pretty solid effort since my vegetable ramen bowl was delicious! The servings were huge. The restaurant is right in the middle of the trendy old town Gilbert- which accounts for the price. $15 for my bowl. It was not as good as other bowls, that's why it's not getting 5 stars. Just lacked a little on flavor."}
{"text":"Natalie is so cool. She is the best ever and I will come back because of her.  Clever Koi rocks!"}
{"text":"I heard great things about Clever Koi so decided to check it out on a Friday night. I expected it to be pretty busy since it was dinner time but I didn't expect to hear the wait time was over an hour. We decided to wait anyways and got seated in about 40mins. I ordered the mushroom dumplings which were a little over cooked and the vegetable ramen which tasted like it came out of a package and wasn't even warm & also lacked flavor. I was so hungry from the long wait to be seated plus it took about 35mins for my entree to come out which wasn't even satisfying. I was pretty disappointed with the overall experience and probably won't ever return."}
{"text":"Downtown Gilbert just stepped it up with the addition of Clever Koi! 

There drink and food menu is very creative and unique! I just left and I can't wait to go back and try something different! 

I went to visit with my husband and we ordered the Duck Fat Sriracha Wings, Rabbit Gyoza, Crispy Pineapple Duck and two cocktails. We started with the Rabbit Gyoza and the flavor of the sauce was amazing, very light but savory. The Sriracha Wings were next. Although it was a nice presentation, the idea looked better on paper than it tasted. They were okay, they tasted like average wings mixed in a Sriracha sauce. The main course was the Pineapple Duck with a rice cake and my husband and I both destroyed it and wish we had more! It was so delicious and full of flavor! 

They also make their own house Sriracha (red and green) and if you like it you can buy one to take home - we definitely did! The Green House Sriracha tasted like a Mexican & Asian hot sauce which added a great touch! Overall we loved it and are excited to go back!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and we were lucky enough to sit at the kitchen bar right in front of the open fire grill. To start, we sampled the pork belly and chicken/wafflle steamed buns. Along with our starters, we ordered some house cocktails (The Enabler and Dark&Stormy). Both drinks complimented our meals. The pork belly paired with the soft bun perfectly and the chicken & waffle was sweet/savory. For our entrée, we tried the Duck Curry and the Thai Chili Beef. The Thai Chili Beef was very tender and cooked perfectly. My favorite part of our meal was definitely the Duck Curry. I am a sucker for duck and all things spicy so this was a no brainer. The curry, while being very spicy, had so much flavor in every bite it was hard to stop eating it and the duck was amazing. However, the star of the dish turned out to be the pickled peppers. I could not get over how good they were in the curry. All in all, amazing food and great staff. Very well done."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! Try the Aviation cocktail, it is outstanding. Really great vibe to this place with both inside and outside seating. The burger from the happy hour menu is really good too."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and this is a great little find in the Down Town Phoenix area!

The steamed buns are something worth trying I have to say.  The chicken and waffles one was my least favorite but the pork bun and the others are really good.  I was a little disappointed in the Pork Belly Ramon though.  The noodles were chewy and not very authentic tasting but the pork belly was really good.  Could have used some different textures in it but it was ok overall.

I will come back here, not a lot of other choices around it but it has great service and wonderful flavors.

{"text":"Went here tonight. The first impression seemed like a very classy restaurant. We ordered a couple drinks--definitely recommend the Scorpion! The food was pretty tasty, too; however, nothing to write home about. It seemed like our server was not having the greatest night--she even told us she wasn't. Overall, the service was very slow, but she was friendly. At the end of the meal, between two people, our bill was over a hundred bucks. Kind of expensive for two people. There are definitely a lot more restaurants in Downtown Gilbert I will try before returning here."}
{"text":"What a disappointing experience. We had wanted to get into this place after experiencing their craft cocktails at a local festival. After always trying to get a reservation on open table but it showing it was booked we decided to call. As it turns out they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. We went and waited at the bar for a table. The cocktails were great although my drink was about 3 sips so not great for the price. At our table we were served one by one. My friends husbands meal came out first then my husbands came out cold and without chicken as requested then my friends came out steaming hot. My food came out so late everyone was nearly done with their food. My husband told them he was missing his chicken and he received it after finishing his meal. Our servers switched during the meal and when asking for our bill they asked us if we had a bottle of wine (which we didn't). They also took away our heat lamp during our meal for another table. We asked that we keep it as it was cold and they said they would bring another which they weren't able to light. It seemed as if they knew they missed the mark when we left but in no way offers to come anything (even the chicken my husband didn't eat because it came out so late). The service was really poor and the food was not amazing. Maybe it is an okay place for a drink but don't waste your time on a meal."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Clever Koi, until a week or so ago when I saw an ad on facebook. There are two locations, in Gilbert and Phoenix. We decided to check out the Phoenix location.  My boyfriend had called ahead for a reservation,  but unfortunately, they only take reservations on weekends for parties of 6 or more. We arrived around 7:45-8 and was told there would be about an hour wait.  We were going to look for another restaurant, but while we were doing that, we scooped up one last spot at the bar to have a drink. While I was seated at the last available bar stool, my boyfriend had to stand.  As we checked out the drink menu, one of the bartenders let us know there were a few people seated at the middle of the bar, and that he would hold 2 seats for us to move down. (By this time,  several other small groups had arrived after us.) A few minutes later, the bartender had us moved down, and my boyfriend and I decided to stay and order our drinks and dinner there-and I'm SO glad we did! 

The atmosphere was very cool - an open style kitchen, 2 bars, and a little outdoor patio area.  I actually preferred sitting at the bar and watching the amazing bartenders making their creative concoctions! All of the drinks looked amazing (I can't wait to go back and try more!) 

For our first cocktail, my boyfriend and I shared the \"Scorpion\", which is a huge drink for 2, in a bowl, with several liqours (I believe brandy, rum, and gin), oranges, and cinnamon, and it is served flaming.  It was DELICIOUS and pretty strong! 

For our dinner, I had the lemongrass chicken ramen. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the chicken had great flavor. My boyfriend had the duck wings. I was a little hesitant to try the wings, because I'm SUPER picky, but OMG they were amazing! The meat was so tender, it fell right off of the bone.

After dinner, we got another round of drinks.  I ordered a drink that was called \"You better call Tyrone\" (or something like that) which has made with chocolate liquers.  This was yummy, but a little bit too strong for me, so we ended up switching drinks. The other one we had ordered was called \"Almost always bad news\", made with rums and citrus flavors, and served in a cool tiki cup. This one was also fruity, delicious and strong! 

The wait staff was attentive and friendly, and even took several pictures for us. We can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favs. For the uniqueness and decadence they bring to each dish. We had a great experience and will definitely be back again!

If you are a first timer try the Lamb Pastrami it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Just a few words to describe our recent visit. You'll be leaving this place hoping you never stepped foot inside. 

My first impressions were fantastic, that is, if I wanted to have an extra pretentious dinner...The service staff were about as friendly as a Waffle House in New Jersey, and if you're not from the shores, allowed me to explain....they're not. Food is definitely subpar. If there was a bar or some sort of standard of quality and taste, they definitely lowered it underground to allow such restaurant to remain in existence. 

Yelp should allow the ratings of negative stars in cases of such extreme substandards. This is one of those cases. Clever Koi...clever not to come out to this place maybe. 

Good atmosphere. Crappy service, except for the manager, maybe too much attention was paid to our party...oh well...that ship has sailed. Food could not be any worse. Enough said...

Only rating 2 stars for the beautiful host!"}
{"text":"If you have ever been on a quest to find the best Ramen in the state, you can find it here.. Not only that, it's might be the best I've ever had. When we sat down our server  Emil, took the time to go over the menu with us in detail .. He was so patient with us..The owner Nick also greeted us and answered other questions we had ..We started with the tuna chips and Ahi crudo..The  chips were light and the combination made the perfect bite .. Next we tried the Rabbit Gyoza.. so flavorful.. we were already extremely happy, then next came the pork belly ramen followed by the catfish and pork belly buns. We could not eat it all ! The owner Nick also took the time to ask about our experience and listened as we shared our appreciation of the  unique flavors and combinations. We have tried many restaurants throughout the country and the world and this is one of my new favorites .. be prepared  to love it !! Old town Gilbert has a lot of choices, but if you want to try a place with delicious made from scratch flavors and original menu items ..this is an amazing option ! PS I met Josh at the downtown location and he's just as kind as Nick ! Thank you Clever Koi"}
{"text":"When you first walk in, the place is a spectacle of its own.  The ambiance is very modern American style dining.  The menu is robust and original.  My girlfriend and I went for dinner for our first time and started out with the wings and the yellowtail crudo.  The wings were a perfect spicy with crushed peanuts to add some awesome flavor.  The yellowtail crudo was delicious as well, very good citrus flavor to get the meal started.

For an entree, she chose the spicy seafood hot pot, which was awesome.  I chose two steamed buns, the pork belly and the chicken and waffle bun.  Both were ridiculous for their own reasons.  The pork belly had so much flavor and the kimchee waffle was a perfect twist on a soul food classic.  

The staff was very friendly and the chef, Jared, was a cool dude and very knowledgable.  You can always tell by looking at a menu whether the chef has a passion for food and this menu is a prime example.  We will definitely be back soon.  On a side note, bring this food to Scottsdale please, thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food and place. Their steam buns are excellent and their pigs face appetizer is a must have!"}
{"text":"I visited the Clever Koi for lunch today and was really impressed. Great food, fantastic service and a very hip atmosphere. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch and was not disappointed. Had the stir fry with chicken...was amazing. I'll definitely go again as the ambience was nice and food was good."}
{"text":"I have returned to Clever Koi several times since my initial visit and they have really stepped up their game....they no longer have 5$ ramen, but, in exchange, they have tastier food. Their calamari, hummus, and tuna chips are all awesome! Their hh burger is tasty too. They also have a number of good and reasonably priced drinks. I've been converted into a fan!"}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails....sloe burn a real winner.
Delicious appies too!
Service very friendly, professional, yet super fun!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant 
Very good food, if you're going to take the duck carry watch out it is extremely spicy.

They also have a great cocktails and a variety of drinks to choose from. 
Great place to go with friends or a date"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service. An addon for my meal was left out (came late), and It was taken off the from the check. Staff is really paying attention to the details. Great place, recommended."}
{"text":"long overdue, i visited this place back in Feb. the drinks and food are truly exceptional."}
{"text":"I love this place!! From the ambiance to the food to the people Clever Koi is five stars. Even when they were at Lost Lake, the food and the people were great. Some of my favorite dishes are their Pad Thai, the chicken ramen, and the pork ramen. But you really can't go wrong. I think I could eat here everyday of the week and never get tired of it."}
{"text":"An attractive place with an interesting menu. It is more like a tapas place, with appetizer size food. Luckily, I don't eat that much. Kind of pricey for just appetizer size food, but, we did enjoy the Asian fusion more creative dining experience. Parking is a bit tough."}
{"text":"Food was meh....the atmosphere was nice. We sat on the patio and had to fight off the flies for the food though and that was not good."}
{"text":"Our first time here and the place hit the trifecta:  nice ambiance, great service, and delicious food.  We tried the pork buns (amazingly delicious with tender pork belly), chicken and waffles bun (I really enjoyed but my wife wasn't a huge fan), pig face dumplings (a little heavy on the Sriracha but very good and on a bed of delicious and fresh kimchi), the pork Ramen (not surprisingly one of their more popular dishes, was very delicious), and the lemon pepper chicken Ramen (my wife loved this crispy chicken ramen).

Overall we are very pleased that I hope to come back sometime.

Returned 5/29/16, tried the seafood hot pot which was really good.  The chow mein with beef had a great taste but I thought was a little dry.  Others in our group tried and really liked the Thai beef chow mein with chicken."}
{"text":"Food is equally delicious as the store on Central in Phx.  It took longer than we would have liked to get our entrees but the food was very good.  Had the chow mein with beef, as well as some pork buns (must try), rabbit gyoza (), and pig face dumplings.  We loved all the appetizers.  I do wish you got a bit more food for the price you are paying.  This new store is much bigger than the one in Phoenix and provides a great ambiance."}
{"text":"Last night my fiancé and I went in to try something new. We cannot brag enough about the atmosphere and kindness we experienced. Our server was Christina and she was so eager to give us advice and direction through the menu. We love food and we love to eat. We cannot wait to go back for some more amazing hospitality. As a fellow bartender and service industry person I am in love with their cocktail menu. So much art is put into the small touches. If you haven't been GO GO GO! Adventures menu with lots to try. Thanks Clever Koi for a memorable experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very interesting spin on Asian food. It all tastes great, but the Pho is really good! The ahi tuna nachos or whatever that dish is called is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent, but the entree I had was small. The restaurant came highly recommended, and I expected a little more. My husband enjoyed the pork ramen immensely and was satisfied, but I wanted more of the House Satay."}
{"text":"By far the best craft cocktails around!  The stout flip (off menu item by Josh) is delicious.  Josh is definitely the man if you want to hang out and enjoy some delicious cocktails!"}
{"text":"I'm at the Clever Koi at least once a month. It always seems to hit the spot. My favorite is the chow mein with loads of toppings including the kim chi. The shrimp is large and always grilled to perfection. The housemade siracha are delicious. The pig face dumplings are out of this world with the right amount of spicy, salty, and all around flavor. The chicken and waffle bun made my eyes roll in ecstasy. (yes!! It was that good) 

The service is always friendly, attentive, and professional.

I love love love this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Visited Clever Koi on a Friday night, pretty busy as expected. We were greeted right away by what seemed like the manager, and was asked to wait for the host to come back and quote our wait time. It took a little longer than expected...manager comes over and quotes us 15-20 minutes letting us know the bar area is open seating. We decide to wait at the bar with some drinks. 

The drinks were phenomenal. I ordered a the Sour Times which I l highly recommend! My bf ordered a vodka gimlet which was also delicious. About 35 minutes go by so we decide to ask what the estimate was. The host quotes us about 15-20 minutes. At this point the manager comes over and apologizes for the wait and handles it with great customer service. 

Without even trying their food, I have to give this place 4 stars purely on their customer service and drinks. Excited to come back and try their food next time!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was gonna be kinda pretentious but I was pleasantly surprised by how nice and cool the staff was. Everyone was super knowledgeable and the food was really good. The short rib and chicken dumplings where great. I forget the name of the fluffy little Asian taco sandwiches but the pork belly ones where sooooooooo freaking good. My girlfriend got the weird vegetarian curry thing and even that was really good. Try this place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Surprised by this restaurant, I have been to many Asian restaurants but this is so far the best Asian restaurant in metro Phoenix at an affordable cost.
Great ambience and service as well.
The drinks and food menus are new and amazing.
We had the Tuna chips, wings with duck siracha sauce as starters and for entries black fried rice and chicken ramen both tasted authentic and great.
Looking forward to revisit soon."}
{"text":"Overall: Great place to try something new. I had been eyeing this place for years and I finally got to try it. 

Food: Great food. Everything tasted fresh. Ordered the fried calamari and the spicy hot pot seafood noodle. Recommend yelpers to try if you like spicy and seafood. 

Service: Very attentive. They made sure we had everything and they even gave us some bowls if we wanted to share our meal. 

Price: The price for our meals were decent for what I ordered. The udon noodles in my soup tasted very fresh. And I didn't expect to get some really nice seared of calamari on top."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and was disappointed to find a limited menu, but every bite we had was quite delicious.  Ample parking behind restaurant.  Excellent service.  Loved the kimchi!  Looking forward to trying dinner and some cocktails next time."}
{"text":"It took me a few visits here to really love it and after that, Clever Koi became a consistent favorite. At first, I had trouble deciding what I was interested in and liked. My go-to had to be the kimchi fried rice. I have had it with pork belly and lemongrass chicken (my fave). The edamame fritters were another fave of mine. I can't tell you how many times I wanted to order a second plate but my pride wouldn't let me. :) Other great items; the spicy ribs, pig face dumplings, and pork ramen ($7 on happy hour!). Speaking of happy hour, they have a decent one with apps and several cocktails ($6). My fave HH cocktail was the Bees Knees. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I \"beyond love\" this place. 
Amazing staff, amazing food. 
I even got the food To-go from Uber Eats and it was equally fantastic which was a nice surprise. 

Complaint... drinks.  I wish you just had regular Tonic and Ginger Beer sometimes. Mixology has limits. 

One of my favorite spots in Phoenix for sure."}
{"text":"It occurred to me today that I have never written a review of this place and I've been coming here semi-regularly for the last two years! Let me just say, if I could give the Clever Koi a hug, I would but my arms just aren't long enough. As an Asian American, the term \"Asian fusion\" tends to give me pause. But the guys who run this place know what they are doing. The food is almost always excellent or near excellent. I feel Clever Koi deserves five stars because they add new menu items with the seasons. The penchant for experimentation shows a restaurant that doesn't rest on its laurels.

Of their permanent items, I like their version of \"chips and guacamole\" which is shrimp chips, tuna and avocado with a bit of wasabi. Their baos are also tasty, especially the soft shell crab and chicken. They are close to authentic bao. As for seasonal items, tonight I had a persimmon beet tart in a matcha puff pastry that was just out of this world. I also had black vinegar ribs that were pretty tender. For the level of creativity and sophistication, I think their prices are absolutely fair. I'm sure if they were in Chicago or New York, everything would be a lot more expensive. 

The icing on the cake is the hospitality. I like to bring my friend's dog to their dog-friendly patio. Then the dog got sick and was really wobbly when we went. We weren't sure if she was going to recover. One of the owners felt so bad, that he had a saucer of chicken brought out for her. And these weren't chicken scraps but nicely chopped pieces that had been cooked in lemongrass. Penny did recover and the co-owner has never forgotten about her and still occasionally brings her some chicken. ;) 

This is the kind of place that I would take out of town guests to. The delicious food and the modern atmosphere make this place on par with any restaurant in NY or LA. I'm such a loyal customer now that they could accidentally set my clothes on fire and I would write it off as just an off day. Not that they would ever do that!"}
{"text":"Clever Koi was FABULOUS!!! My husband and I shared the tuna chips, pork ramen and the bahn mi, everything was delicious! I love how they have multiple specialty cocktails to choose from. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Addiction happens. 5/5 people become addicted to the banana fritters served here. You can't quit them. They are so hot, yummy, so sought after, and perfect that they should be the new bitcoins of foodie culture.

Many have claimed cleverness, to be the best, world-famous, and yet they deceive me. Lies. How dare they.

But here, there is truth. There is yummy. Every. Where. 

Grapefruit lemongrass soda - genius
Spaghetti and meatballs - fun, fresh, smokey grill goodness with exploding flavor tomatoes
Tempura pea ramen - light, refreshing, delicious
Banana fritters - they are really the best freakin malasadas humbly under the disguise of \"fritters\"

If you've eaten too much and decide to skip dessert, then you are not worthy."}
{"text":"This is an excellent atmosphere for a date or just to come in and relax. Great music, service, and food.  The menu has plenty to offer any craving and the kimchi leaves a flavorful impact that one will have to come back for more. Did I mention dessert? Yum! Loved the banana fritters. I can't wait to come back for future tastings!"}
{"text":"Ambience: A
Cleanliness: A
Customer Service: A
Food: A-

Price 
-I am from NY so everything in Arizona seems cheap to me, but this place was slightly more expensive than other places I visited in the area, but it was also more fancy. 

Atmosphere
-It was very cute, we were seated within seeing distance of the \"food bar\" (not sure what the correct term was) but we got to see the chef preparing various dishes which was pretty cool. The decor was also very nice.  


Customer Service 
No complainants whatsoever! There was about 10 of us on a service trip and we were hungry and a tad bit drunk yet our server was totally polite and efficient in taking our orders and getting us our food.   

Food 
It was good. I ordered something pretty basic because I am not the most adventurous person, but my companions ventured out and everyone loved what they got. The ramen is the best, it is certainly NOT what you get at 7-11.

Overall
I did not expect to find good Asian cuisine in Arizona but I really liked this place. Everything was an A experience."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Phoenix location since it opened and it has always been a favorite of mine. The staff is always friendly and helpful, the food and drinks are phenomenal and if you rate this place anything fewer than five stars, I honestly don't trust you as a human being. The ambiance is sexy, fun and adorable AF. Do yourself a favor and get the French 95 cocktail and the duck curry....you're welcome."}
{"text":"I've been to CK a few times (just getting to inputting all my reviews) and this is one of my favorite fusion restaurants in Phoenix. The flavor profile is amazingly different and unlike any other Asian restaurant that i've been to. My favorite dishes are the Kimchi Fried Rice and Roasted Pork Belly. 

The space is well designed and open and it's a great date night place if you want something different."}
{"text":"The steamed dumplings are amazing! Totally in love with the duck one. Even my friend who had never had duck and was kinda apprehensive to try it, loved it! I enjoyed my noodles and drink as well.  The wait staff was fantastic, always full drinks, great recommendations, knew the menu and how to explain it. Only bad thing was, the sign out front is really hard to see, we drove past twice, then we tried to park at the garage next door, so we had to go through the neighborhood, where there actually is a huge sign that you can't miss.

I'm excited to come back again and try other things!"}
{"text":"Modern trendy atmosphere. Service was impeccable (thank you Brian).  Went for happy hour but ate off regular menu as well.  Inspired offerings. We had Kimchi Poutine which I think is pork belly with shitake mushroom gravy and french fries (husband loved it), Shrimp Toasts was great as were the fabulous steamed buns.  Chicken & Waffles, Duck Confit, Soft Shell Crab, Roasted Pork Belly.   Next time we'll try the Ramen dishes. I'm not a big drinker but loved the Pimms.  Owner Nick came over to introduce himself and was friendly, charming and on top of his game.  Will absolutely come back again!"}
{"text":"Found a brillo pad metal hair in our seafood noodles, but the staff was good looking, so I'll be back. Pig face dumpling with kimche was yummy, duck sticky bun was better then lamb sticky bun.
Why didn't they comp the whole the meal? They only comped the brillo pad noodles, if I'm pooping blood I'm going to be mad."}
{"text":"I would like to think that my friends have a great taste in their food and restaurant choices. But, maybe I am just not a fan.  

The story goes like this: I dropped in for lunch and I wasn't convinced. Then, I dropped in for dinner and I still left unconvinced. --For lunch I went with the (Banh Mi) LemonGrass Chicken. A couple weeks later I had the dinner option and we went for the Peking Duck steamed buns, Smoked Bok Choy dumplings and Thai Kale salad. -- The Thai Kale salad was quite delectable. All things said and done, the drinks were very tasty and the ambiance of the Clever Koi is amazing.  But it's going to take more convincing than that to keep me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Well, what a nice experience here at Clever Koi.  The pork belly bun and chicken waffle was so good. My daughter had the pineapple duck and I had steak chow main.  Everything was delightful and well presented. Kenzie, our server, was attentive and friendly. She knew the menu well, provided great descriptions, and suggestions.  Our glasses were never empty.  At one point I turned around in my chair to look at the decor and another employee immediately came over to see if we needed anything.  Now for the ambiance: elegant but not fussy, minimal  but inviting, and architecturally lovely. I will definitely come back.  My new fav in this area!"}
{"text":"I definitely understand why the reviews are all over the place for Clever Koi. I went for dinner one night. The restaurant is very pretty and decorated well, and I like that the patio faces Central Avenue. You can valet in the back; the parking lot is right next to the one for George and Dragon.

My husband had the chicken katsu rice and I had the massaman udon. I didn't really care for the seasong on the katsu, and I thought the kimchi was just OK. The massaman udon was good, though I think there could have been more duck. Our food came out REALLY fast. I've read other reviews that suggest the food is premade and I did get that feeling - not that it was seasoned and frozen and then thawed out for me, but that it was made earlier in the day and kept warm until ready to be served. I might be completely off mark, but overall it was just good, not great.

I wouldn't mind going back for happy hour, especially if I can sit on the patio, and I'd like to try a few more menu items. Good, nice, A-OK."}
{"text":"The short rib dumplings were AMAZING! They were recommended by our server and our favorite item of the night. A close second was the Lop Chong. The sausage was crispy but not dried out, nor was it greasy. We also shared the lemon pepper chicken ramen which was good, but next time I would just order 1,000 more dumplings :) We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went with friends.   I had the chicken wings app and pork tenderloin entree.  The wings were very messy with the sauce, as was expected, and they were nothing to write home about. Flavor was slightly Asian, but not much.  

Friends got the tuna chips app and that was delicious. Chips were tortilla shaped, but very thin, crisp, and light. The tuna and ingredients made some of the chips soggy.  The tuna on it was partially raw/seared and was great. Avocado was on top.  I thought it was wasabi, but it was not.

My pork came on top of some mix that was delicious.  I ate some of that first. Then I are the pork by starting on the outside, but then decided to cut through the middle to eat the meat where there was less fat/gristle. When I did that, I took a thin slice from the middle and it tasted under-cooked, even raw.  The texture was not of cooked pork.  Then I looked closely at it and it was pink and not white like cooked pork should be.

Since I have great concerns eating any raw pork due to the parasitic worms traditionally in pork meat that must be thoroughly cooked to kill them, I noted it to the water refill guy.  He said he would check on it. He then quickly came back and said that they would cook me a new one.  I was glad to hear that without having to ask. I thought they may just microwave or reheat it on the hot plate.  

When the new pork tenderloin came, it was perfectly cooked, delicious, and white on the inside as expected. Not at all raw thankfully.  I appreciated their great customer service, and they made it right with me by replacing the order with a fresh one.  Although this one was still a bit fatty/gristly, since it was well cooked, the fat was rendered well and had a nice crisp singe on it that made it taste really good.  I used their table green and red sauce with it which made for a delicious sauce. 

My friends had pad Thai. She was unimpressed with it and did not like the nuts that came with it (which was noted on the menu).  I let her know that she should specify no nuts in the future since pad Thai always comes with nuts.  She got it with shrimp. The shrimp were small-medium sized. She did not finish her meal. The noodles (to me) were a bit under-cooked and chewy.  She said she does not want to return there.  I would not mind going there again and trying other things.

Other friend had shrimp over brown rice (which looked like black rice when it arrived).  The shrimp were giant on that entree and he enjoyed his meal quite a bit.  He ate all of it.

I give it 4/5 stars because pork should never be served raw/under-cooked.  It's a health hazard.  Otherwise it would have been 5/5 because the service was exceptional and they made it right."}
{"text":"One of my favorite new spots. I would eat the pork ramen every day if I could. The food is consistent and delicious and the cocktails are well crafted. Staff is always kind and attentive. Check them out for a very good Happy hour. Try the curry and the steamed buns!"}
{"text":"This is only for the Pork Ramen. Truthfully, I thought I the ramen was average. The noodles and broth weren't the best but wasn't the worst. The meat in the ramen however was the best meat I've tasted. I would only order the ramen during happy hour since the regular price is too much. ($15)"}
{"text":"Changed my life. 

Not sure if this is your grandma's ramen, but it's some of the best I've ever had. The pork ramen has a spicy, pungent flavor that is not overpowering. Don't listen to the reviews that hate on it, because they are wrong!! Simply orgasmic ramen. 

This is a new place that is still figuring out the finer points of service, but the one guy who brought me my drink and took my plates away (not sure re name) is a real winner. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"so I came in here the other day, I think it was a saturday? either way, this place is amazing. the staff are cool, the cooks are good. the atmosphere is astonishing. I had their signature burger and I damn near shit my pants. it was THAT good. check them out. you won't regret coming here!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised I never rated this fanatic restaurant. I've been here many times since they opened. Never had a mad meal here. The service is perfect.  Try the kimchee rice or the forbidden rice dishes. The calamari fries are a perfect appetizer along with the tuna chips. 

Back here again. The food and the experience keeps getting better. I love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place was super cute and had some great pork buns! But the one thing I will say is that their entrees are not up to par like their appetizers. Do not order the ramen. The broth tastes terrible!!! But other than that it was a good experience! I'd suggest doing an appetizer and drink night there!"}
{"text":"I'll make this short and sweet. the restaurant is small and has a cute setup. The staff are nice and were attentive. THE PEKING DUCK STEAMED BUN IS TO DIE FOR. The lamb pastrami bun was pretty good too but it's covered in a vinaigrette sauce that's a bit overpowering. the roasted pork ramen wasn't as good as we imagined it to be. the seafood hot pot flavor was amazing as delicious and it did have good portion of fish, but it was lacking broth and the bowls were SO small for a 14 dollar noodle soup dish....  when it got a bit busier, the guys behind the kitchen looked like they were struggling to keep up. there were 5 guys running into each other and looked very disorganized and it took a good hour for our food to come out. I would come back but only for the steamed buns."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are both teachers, so during our breaks, we like to enjoy weekday dates (something we don't normally experience during the school year). We knew about a $2 bowling special on Tuesday nights at our local alley so we decided to make an evening of it and go to dinner first. I had heard good things about The Clever Koi so we went to try it out.

First, let me start by saying I love the building The Clever Koi is located in, as well as the surrounding businesses. It's a cool, modern space with a few traditional oriental touches. We were bummed to realize that all of the patio tables were full, but unsurprised as it was a gorgeous evening outside. Instead, we posted up at the bar where we were greeted by our waiter/bartender (who I later realized is also an owner). We were given menus and discovered that they are currently running a deal for $35 that included 4 beers and 2 bowls. Score! We chose to upgrade to 4 cocktails for an extra $5 and ordered a dark & stormy and a whiskey drink called the blinker; both were excellent. We ordered our entrees (pork ramen for me, mongolian beef bowl for the fella), but also decided to try 2 of the steamed buns as an appetizer. We got the more traditional duck bun, as well as the chicken and waffle bun. Those came out within a few minutes, and I have to say, as much as I wanted to like the chicken and waffle steamed bun, I couldn't. The menu description said \"kimchi waffle\", but I couldn't taste any bite from the kimchi in the dish. Likewise, the menu stated there was a \"chili maple syrup\", but I didn't taste any heat. The chicken was cooked well, but there was just nothing special about it and the waffle was kind of cold and soggy. The duck bun, on the other hand, was quite good, although nothing special again. The portion size was fairly large for $4.50 though and I would be interested to try their 2 other styles of steamed buns.

After a drink refill, our main courses arrived and oh. My. God. It was good. The pork ramen broth was flipping amazing. Big hunks of delicious pork belly floated around, as well as a kimchi and a soft egg. The combo of crunchy, spicy kimchi was so well paired with the creamy egg center. It was seriously so amazing, I can't wait to go back when the weather cools down a little more and gulp it by the bowl full. My boyfriend really enjoyed his mongolian beef too, demolishing the whole bowl. I saved some of my ramen to take home and it reheated perfectly the next day.

Overall, a really solid experience. The decor was awesome, the service was casual and friendly, and even a not so stellar steamed bun couldn't ruin an absolutely phenomenal ramen. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Very cool place. Delicious dumping! I has the soft-shell crab bun and it was great. There were a lot of options on the menu and the bar has great drinks too."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend today. I had the ramen and she had the sweet sour pork bento box. After ordering she asked hostess for crackers or a little something as she is a diabetic and was getting shaky. After a few minutes, I decided to run out to the car to get something for her to eat. I came back in and she still had not gotten the piece of bread that they were going to bring to her. She about completed the breakfast crackers I brought in before they brought out the bread. It took awhile before getting food. When you order ramen/saimin back home on Maui, it comes out in no time. Anyway, the ramen with dashi broth had no flavor and the noodles didn't have any either. The shrimp in the ramen also lacked flavor. They asked if I wanted anything else, and I just want rice as I ate the shrimp (because I needed to get something in my belly). The sweet sour pork was mediocre. Waiter had no enthusiasm, didn't check on us, didn't see him smile...or at least I didn't see him smile. On a good note, they did not charge me for the meal. This just reiterates why we always eat at the same places. The last couple of times we tried someplace new to us, we were very, very disappointed! Que sera sera."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and plating.

We walked in to claim our reservation and the host knew us immediately.  He had already set up our table on the patio and it was beautifully decorated with a small lavender bouquet and some votive candles.

Food is a bit \"meh\" unfortunately.  We did enjoy the steamed buns (chicken & waffle, soft shell crab, and pork belly), but the ramen was awful.  They had infused kim chi into the broth which was a bold choice that didn't play well with me.  Also the pork belly was excessively fatty - yes I know it's supposed to be fatty but there was only like a centimeter of meat meat included.

Service was subpar.  We didn't seem to have one dedicated waiter but a bunch of them just dropping in, and not very often.  

Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Came for Restaurant Week and loved the place. Sat outdoors and the weather was good. We shared the teriyaki short rib which was amazing with the apple & daikon kimchi. We also had the pork face dumplings - they were good, but not the best I've ever had. 

We both had the seared hamachi which was heavenly. The sauce helped make the dish and I had a weird love for the mushrooms that were in the dish too. 

As for the desserts.. I hope I remember mine forever. The banana fritters were the best dessert I've ever had. The soft dough with five spice sugar, the bananas that seemed to be melting, and the red miso caramel had me almost crying in-between bites. 
 
I checked out the happy hour menu and I definitely wanna go back again."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday afternoon with a friend. The place is really cute! I'm a Southern coastal girl and love mussels but o hated the mussels here. Fortunately the staff was very sweet to bring me something different. The beef pho was much butter but definitely a one person starter. My friend got the chick and waffle and the fish taco and she enjoyed it. I'd like to go back for dinner to really enjoy the restaurant."}
{"text":"My coworker Mario lives just down the street from Cleaver Koi, and I've been jonesing to try this new restaurant ever since I heard about it over the summer. I picked up a menu to study prior to ordering. We ended up splitting the seafood hot pot, lamb pastrami and Peking duck steamed buns, smoked \"pig face\" dumplings and Chinese long beans. While the hot pot was good, I probably wouldn't order it again (but I'm not a huge soup person, unless it's pho). The house bacon lured me to order the Peking duck, and while it was delicious on its own it wasn't as amazing as the lamb pastrami. Good gravy that meat rocked! The pig face dumplings are packed with guanciale and is absolutely heavenly paired with kimchi. The long beans with crispy duck tongue were as awesome as it sounds--the lightly battered and fried tongues taste slightly like mushrooms and melt in your mouth.

Overall, we were both impressed with Cleaver Koi. The food was great and reasonably priced. The music was hip but not too loud. While there is outside seating, it's far too cold to enjoy. Regardless, I'm already planning my next meal for when I return."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner last night at the Clever Koi.  Started with an awesome drink called Dr. Funk which was a great start.  A complete list of appetizers and entrees was available and we got lucky that we could sit on the patio with our dog since this is a pet friendly place.  Service was good and atmosphere great.  All in all a good time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Clever Koi on a spur-of-the-moment date night. We were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere, decor and most importantly, the food! The confit wings were awesome (the pickled peppers really make the dish), and the entrees were fantastic. He got the lemon pepper ramen, and I got a carnitas sandwich with a side salad that included the best sweet pickles I've had (I had to take some of them home). The manager was very friendly, asked how we were doing and gave us a homemade sriracha bottle to take home! How cool is that? Definitely try this place, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME, Nick and Partners great job on managing your business. This place is spot on, the food, cocktails and service hit the mark. My wife and I really enjoyed our dinning experience, this is what going out is all about. Go Check this place out."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, fantastic food and incredible staff.  The Pork Ramen was off the charts.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Our server was amazing; making recommendations and knowing her menu. Food delicious. From being seated, drinks, appetizers, and entree was well paced. A bit noisy on a Saturday evening. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Found this place in a hurry, and regret we could not stay longer to try everything on the menu. Fantastic concepts behind each dish we ordered. The cocktails were high quality and innovative, and the service was impeccable. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for something new and exciting!"}
{"text":"Never ever again Clever Koi. Never. Ambiance was very hipster with loud music.  That's fine.  Service? Meh.  The hubs and I took my parents here for dinner to celebrate my mothers health.  We waited about 25 minutes for our table - even though there were other tables sitting empty.  

My mom and I ordered the seafood hot pot. Okay when you think hot pot, you think of those pots where you throw in a bunch of veggies, seafood, meat, what have you - never did I think that it meant it was SPICY HOT.  We had started off with our unimpressive appeitzer of the catfish/scallop/shrimp dumplings with \"nuoc cham\" which is basically fish sauce.  The four dumplings were about the size of a quarter and sat inside a HUGE bowl filled with fish sauce.  For $8, I'd say that's a hefty rip off.  We all literally leaned in towards the table to look inside the giant bowl at our dumplings.  Next up we ordered the wood grilled octopus/sea weed/xo aioli sauce - BLAH.  All bun, no octopus.  We also tried the peking duck/house bacon/mizuna/charred plum jam - that was just meh.  Ugh so disappointing, at yet another $4/bun.  

My mom's SPICY seafood udon bowl came out - it was too spicy so she gave it to my dad.  And he ate it.  Said it was decent.  We sat there and watched him eat.....eat.....eat....eat....and then he was done.....and we sat there and looked at his empty bowl as our bowls had still yet to come out.  I don't get it, we ordered 2 of the same bowls - at least the 2nd one should have come out?  The hostess came to clear my dads bowl - I told her we still hadn't gotten ours yet, she kinda apologized and walked off.  About 15 minutes later, the 2nd udon bowl came out and one of the pork ramen bowls came out.  So I told my mom and hubs to eat.  As I sat there and watched them eat.....and eat.....and eat.  Towards their last few bites, my pork ramen bowl came out - the server, or maybe it was the manager came out to deliver it to me and apologized for the delay of the entire meal and said this bowl was on the house.  That was a nice gesture - but considering the circumstances, all our bowls should have been comp'd.  My mom and I couldn't finish our pork bowls - it was so extremely salty - the \"broth\" was so dark it tasted and looked like it was sitting in a bowl of soy sauce.  

After my 1 comp'd ramen bowl, our bill still came out to over $80.  I'm all for fusion food - but this was just ridiculous."}
{"text":"Server was very friendly, hipster vibe kind of spot with great music. The environment is fast but still artsy and lounge feel to it. Our server suggested great drinks and great dishes that were on point. The Edamame & Kale appetizer was so delicious, its tempura style drizzled with a sweet and spicy sauce, I highly recommend this! If you love Chow Mein and love pork then get the Veggie, Pork Belly Chow Mein bowl. Its to die for and so very very flavorful! Bowl portions are large and you could even share."}
{"text":"The pork belly ramen was so delicious. They offer a red and green Sriracha sauce. The green sauce was so good I wanted to put it in my purse!!! (I didn't). Would return!"}
{"text":"Craving for Asian food after watching a movie in the City of Gilbert, we've decided to stop by Clever Koi and give it a try.

Since we did not have a reservation, we could either wait around for 45 minutes to sit on a table or we could sit in the bar area for as long as it is available. (Tips: make reservation in the weekend). We ordered a Crab Shell Bun as an appetizer and a Pork Belly Ramen noodle for entrée. Crab Shell bun portion was only enough for one person to share. It was beautifully decorated with lots of vegetables and a bit of a crab shell with it. However, the taste was a bit blend for me. The crab was too fishy. I probably will not order that again (but always worth a try right?). The broth on the pork belly ramen noodle soup was rather tasty, noodle portion was generous and it had a decent portion of pork meat in it. Overall, the food was ok. The bartender was our server that night. It was fun watching him making all kinds of alcohol drinks while waiting for our food. 

Overall, the service and the food was decent. Restaurant is beautifully decorated and the general atmosphere is relaxing & welcoming. If I am in the general area again, I certainly don't mind coming back to give it another try. If you are a wine/beer drinker, I will highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you like good cocktails and Asian food that isn't your run of the mill orange chicken etc then you'll love this place! If you're looking to try something new and innovative with great atmosphere and friendly service, this is the spot. Every drink I've ever had is fantastic, the riding the pine is my favorite but my fiancé and I just shared the scorpion bowl last week and it was killer, plus a fun experience since old school tiki drinks can be hard to find in az. Some reviews mention the portions being small, however I would argue the opposite. The appetizers and are smaller dishes, but they aren't meant to be full meals, any of the noodle or rice dishes are definitely enough for two people to split if they've had any starters or if you want lunch for the next day. I've never left hungry or without leftovers. The design of the restaurant is very refined for Gilbert and a great date spot if you want to escape for an evening from normal life to a little big city vibe without straying too far from home."}
{"text":"I was debating a 3 or 4 star for this place on my drive home.  I decided this place is certainly over the 3.5 star mark, so 4 star it is.

First, you will find that the Cleaver Koi is on the west side of Central/Lite Rail in a small copper/bronze colored building that has a small breezeway down the middle.  The sign out front is small.  You should turn on/down (don't U turn) Glenrosa St or if you U-turn, be sure to turn into their parking lot at the FIRST left turn (just north of the building) you get to.  If you try that second turn, you will be turning into the wrong parking lot and you will have to circle around on Central and come back again.  Don't ask me how I know this.  But I will say it could be helpful information for those who are not familiar with the area.

Cleaver Koi is a very \"neat/cute\" space.  I LOVE the ambiance, the look and feel of the restaurant.  It has an atmosphere that is right on par with Central Phoenix, hipster, chic, cool.  I stopped in there today, a Saturday, for lunch. The cleaver Koi has been open about 2 months, so there wasn't a crowd, but the server mentioned that the day before on a Friday, they were completely packed pretty much the entire lunch and dinner service.  So as the masses are finding out about this place, it is filling up like good CenPho restaurants do.

My friend and I ordered a variety of things.  Here's my take on a few of memorable things.

My favorite item was the \"Pig Face\" dumplings!!!  Amazingly delicious and savory with an appropriate level of spice.  Tender dumplings that practically melt in your mouth. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#TwNmKVIhbSWHQgm22KMfQw

We also tried the following notable things:
Salt and Pepper Shrimp:  worth having again.  I was pleased with the size and amount of this dish.  I would have had that as an entre.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#QJLxMqO42DMuun5bZzDsoA

Peking Duck Steamed Bun:  Oh man, the duck is very good!  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#uy69wuSn45EnO-Z0sUj88Q

I will definitely come back here for HH when I get the opportunity.  I originally planned to have the roasted pork ramen, but I ended up ordering the Massaman Noodles.  I was satisfied with it, but I ordered it thinking that the noodles would be in a more brothy/soup-like base.  but this dish is certainly a curry (gravy) texture (as the menu stated) and the dish could be eaten with chopsticks.

Oh, they have the cutest crafted cocktail menu... there's one drink \"Hey Bartender\"... you tell them the spirit and the flavor choice you like... the bartender creates a drink just for you.  It worked twice for us!  Awesome, loved it."}
{"text":"Always happy with Clever Koi. The menu is unique and the service is always good. I like how the owners all work there because you can tell they really care about their customers and the experience that they have."}
{"text":"Wow!  I had dinner here earlier this week and was really, well....wowed!  We sat at the bar in front of the cooking action so we had a chance to get a little insight on the menu, ingredients, recommendations, etc.  We started out with the Peking duck bun.  Think Chinese taco.  It was seriously tasty, stuffed with succulent duck with a little bit of crisp on the edges and a tasty, bright dipping sauce.  Next we ordered the pig face  dumplings (cheek).  They were served on a little kimchi with their house made sriracha (they should bottle and sell the stuff).  The dumplings were tender and delicous.  The stand-out dish of the night for me was the wood grilled octopus.  I will return specifically for this dish.  As the name indicates, the pieces of octopus are wood grilled and have a slight char on them and are pile atop the crispy rice cake and surrounded by a beautiful, rich, bright and absolutely delicious broth.  This was hands down the best preparation of octopus I've ever had and it made me wonder why I'd never thought of grilling it.  It was super tender and the combo of flavors and textures - smokey, crispy, creamy, citrus, spice....superb.  Entrees did not disappoint.  We had the Kung Pao brisket with brown rice and the roasted pork ramen.  I can't say a bad thing about either dish.  From the super tender brisket in the Kung Pao and the perfectly cooked egg in the ramen, it was pure yumminess!  They somehow talked us into dessert and recommended the banana fritters served with a lush caramel sauce and their coconut rice pudding soft serve ice cream.  We practically licked the bowls clean.  Yeahhhhh...........we'll be back.  :-)"}
{"text":"What can I say about TCK (The Clever Koi) that hasn't been said by those of you that have already been. This amazing jewel was a last minute stop in for us. Grade A+ for the Service, everyone was very nice and hospitable, the drinks were perfect for the season, and the food was on point, off the chain, and \"slap yo momma\" good! We had the KUSHIYAKI: Calamari  and the Tandoori Chicken, these delicious starters kicked the food party off right! The crab was cooked to perfection, very crispy and full of flavor. The Calamari was so EFFEN good!  My wife had the Spicy Seafood Hot Pot it was so good I was only given a small taste, but I couldn't blame her. I had the Salt & Pepper Crab.. If you don't try anything else as a seafood lover, try this!!!  
We had this very attentive  (what we thought was a Bartender) assisting us while we were waiting, he asked us very detailed questions about our taste in booze, made suggestions based on the season of AZ, and ensured that we LOVED what he served us before walking away, and this awesome service was provided by one of the owners Nick! Now, if you don't find that small bit of our evening as EPIC customer service.. Please let me know of a place that the owner leads by that type of example. We'll be back but in a group setting very soon!"}
{"text":"The perfect trifecta... front of the house management, craft cocktail/bar management, and the heart of the house the chef. This restaurant is a well oiled machine. I have dined here several times and enjoy taking people for their first experience. Clever koi never disappoints with their on point team service, amazing food and cocktails. My most recent experience the bar manager talked with my boyfriend for 15 minutes discussing Japanese whiskey while providing me one amazing gin drink after another. The food was outstanding as usual. We tried four different courses. If you truly enjoy a full dinning experience this the place. Try the seasonal ramen."}
{"text":"This place has a great ambiance, staff are really cool, when I first went with a large group of around 8 people, we had to wait for 30-40 minutes to get our food served . If you go in a smaller group they are relatively fast.  They have a very simple Lunch Menu, you need to select the type of Rice/ Noddle's , Meat, Veggies, Sides.  I love fried rice with Eggs, Lemongrass chicken,  Mushroom, Kimchi and Pickled ginger combination. I once went to eat dinner and found the appetizers expensive and with very less quantity. Overall, if you have ample amount of time for lunch and you want to have good fired rice this is the place you should try out for sure."}
