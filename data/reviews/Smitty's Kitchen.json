{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants we have eaten at. The ambiance is spectacular. The owner and the staff are absolutely wonderful. Oh yeah, the food could not be any better.   If you want spicy or not Spicy, they will accommodate you.  This is one restaurant you NEED to visit. We will be a regular place we visit often."}
{"text":"Great service, good food and a nice atmosphere! We totally recommend stopping here if you're in downtown Glendale! Looking forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"We just moved to historic Glendale Az and the food in this area is amazing. The husband and I tried Smitty's Kitchen and it was awesome. To drink we ordered Iced Tea and Ginger Beer (best I have had so far!). We started with fried plantains which were delicious and cooked to perfection. I ordered Chicken Stew with coconut rice and he ate Goat Stew with couscous. Both were astoundingly good. The spices were amazing and both plates had just the right amount of heat for both of us. We finished off the night with a brownie and warm conversation with the owner. It was an all around delicious experience. I hope Smitty's Kitchen plans on hosting a Valentines Dinner."}
{"text":"I found Smitty's food at a locale farmers market, it was delightful.  She dose have FuFu (FooFoo) if you ask.   They will need time to make it, so a phone call will be required.   Here is a video on men eating FuFu.  http://youtu.be/vVRZhT3qudM  One man is eating with spoon.  There is variation to eating FuFu, with a few rules that are must, you must have washed your hands, and the hand you eat with never touching anything but your food.    I attended a formal party, and was given instruction prior to dinner.  It is interesting watching these men eat.  I was instructed to take small piece of FuFu, make a pit with thumb, use as a scoop.  Not to get the stew all over my figures as in video.  There were guests from about 8 different country's, no sauce dropped on to clothing, and no one eat such large mouthfuls.  On the other hand, some put the ball of FuFu in the bowl with the soup/stew or meats & vegetables on top, others had a bowl with their FuFu on a plate.  With one table eating from communal bowls of food in the middle of the table.    {Africa has 47 country's with island over 50, FuFu or a form of FuFu is the bread of most, to my knowledge}"}
{"text":"Friendly service, great appetizers. We ordered beef patty ( like a empanadas ) and fried plantains.  Large servings good value and not greasy. The chicken stew and chicken peanut soup was also delicious. Tip: call ahead and ask them to make FuFu. It's plantain mashed into a starchy ball... You pull off a piece of FuFu and dip or scoop  it into the stew or soup. If not you'll get the delicious rice."}
