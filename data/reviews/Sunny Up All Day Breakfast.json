{"text":"Delicious breakfast & friendly service. Their breakfast potatoes are the real deal and have small bits of green pepper and onions in them. Bacon was crispy and didn't seem too fatty. Portions were generous. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here a few times and love it! Great breakfast food for great prices. Best for those who wake up later... Breakfast is all day !!!"}
{"text":"We happened to be in the area and we saw the sign for all-day breakfast. That was exactly what we were in the mood for, but when we saw the menu we were tempted more by the wonderful dishes on the menu. We didn't wind up ordering breakfast. My husband ordered the butter chicken and it was prob the best butter chicken I've ever had!  Great portion size. All made fresh. Lots of chicken. The service was excellent. The waitress was sweet and attentive. She even put a fresh pot of coffee on for us.   We went back a few weeks later and we both ordered the butter chicken. Again it was superb.  We live in Etobicoke but it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"We went for a Sunday morning breakfast. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Food was excellent and served very fast. Servings are very generous and you can get all the coffee you want."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and wonderful people! Best hash browns I've had in a long time! Absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"M a big breakfast fan... But cudnt find any better place than sunny up in neighbourhood. Reasonable prices with delicious food makes it all time favourite. Only tried breakfast here thou n must say it's really good"}
{"text":"I ate here on a weekday during lunch hour and there were only a few customers.  When placing my order of pancakes and waffles it took a bit of time to have the food brought to the table.  Service could have been faster and when finished I waited a while for the server before going up to pay the bill."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new breakfast place. This place is my new favourite. Pros: - Clean!!!, everything looks brand new. I think they just moved. - Good breakfast menu with large amounts of food on the plate for under 10$(even kids meal looked to be enough for an adult) - Friendly staff - Place is quiet since not that many know about it I guess(looks shady on the outside though)  Cons: - Cold inside, outside temperature was -20° but that what heaters are for...Weird...but perhaps we visited too early in the morning."}
{"text":"Really great spot for breakfast. Friendly and quick service. Portions were the perfect size.  I feel like we got our money's worth and everything was really tasty. Home fries were delicious. I will be back."}
{"text":"Small portions, super fatty (inedible) bacon for at least half the pieces, luke warm coffee, oily food. Same pricing as other breakfast spots that we have tried but a lot less food. Manager was rude and not responsive and slow (only one wait staff for the entire place on a Sunday) hence our order was missing a few items but they gladly charged us for the whole thing, even after we complained. No one to offer coffee refills. Would I come back? No."}
{"text":"It was hard to tell if it was open as we pulled up... I mean there were 2 huge flashing OPEN signs which suggested that they should be but the interior pot lighting made the restaurant look dim. That said, the restaurant was well lit once we got inside.   We were greeted promptly by the cook/waiter/maître d'hôtel and allowed to sit anywhere. We chose a window booth. Seating options also included round, square and long rectangular tables which would comfortably sit 1-12 people together. The booths are plain but comfortable and for other large folks out there: the booths are ROOMY! No mushroom-topping going on!  The menu was straight forward and relatively diverse in its selection of breakfast items. We selected the mushroom and Swiss omelet as well as the Mediterranean omelet. Both were excellent and came with delicious fried potatoes (with peppers and onions) as well as toast. The omelets were delicious and well priced. The coffee was EXCELLENT and reasonably priced at $2.50 for a bottomless cup.   My single food complaint revolved around the extras that we ordered... $1.99 for a half cup of fried button mushrooms? $2.50 for either 3 strips of bacon or 2 small sausages? Not very good value. Other issues: bathroom lighting was poor in the ladies and neither washroom had a change table (not diaper friendly).   Overall, this was a 4 star experience but because there are breakfast joints which I prefer in the area and which are diaper friendly, I probably won't become a regular."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast with the family. I came here twice now and the place is quite consistent with its food and service. Subtle differences from your average breakfast joint, however I would still pick this place over a Cora's/Eggsmart - totally love their spicy home fries/fried potatoes (Could eat that all day!). Highly recommend giving this place a try if your in the area and are craving breakfast."}
{"text":"I love their crab cakes with poached eggs.  Its my absolute favorite breakfast and I have had it several times.  Western Sandwich was good.  Very good home fries.   Fish & chip for lunch was average.  Service is very good and prices decent.  Good value over all."}
{"text":"These home fries are amazing right now :) soft, moist and flavorful potatoes probably cooked in a skillet with lots of caramelized onions.  These are not your typical deep fried frozen square cut home fries.   5/5 stars just for the home fries."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite breakfast spot in the area. The homefries really lived up to their hype, the best Ive ever had! You can really tell the cooks care about the food they cook and put energy and love into it. The waiter was really nice, food came out quickly and the prices are affordable. A bit worried they might end up closing down since we were the only customers on a Sunday morning. I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"1 word: YUM! I ordered the sunny up breakfast which came with 2 eggs, bacon, potatoes (home fries) and toast. The home fries are phenomenal. They were so tasty!!! It literally blew me away. It was seasoned to perfection. We also ordered the bacon and cheese sandwich which was great. The only thing is, the waiter took very long to bring our bill but other than that she was very nice. I highly suggest this restaurant to anyone looking for a tasty breakfast in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, I ventured out to south-eastern Scarborough to try Sunny Up All Day Breakfast, and was very pleased with the food and service. Since I didn't get around to writing this review as yet, I decided to go back this past Sunday to see if it would be any different when they are busier. But not really, I had another nice relaxing slower-paced breakfast. Being well off the beaten path, they have a large open restaurant, with spacious seating for maybe 50 people, with comfortable booths along the side wall. (If this was located downtown, there would probably be twice as many tables squeezed in side-by-side.) The décor is very bold and bright, brown wood booths, red and blue chairs, lots of large windows. (It kind of reminded me of Panagio's on McCowan Rd.) The same server was very polite and attentive the first time, a little less so on the busier Sunday, but still very good.  On my first trip, I had eggs with bacon and sausage, home fries, toast and coffee. Everything was fine, although the toast was very lightly toasted. This past Sunday, I chose the Sunny Up waffle, which was 1 large waffle covered with sliced strawberries-kiwis-bananas and whipped cream (ice cream was the other option). The waffle was light and fluffy, and the fruits were all excellent. Coincidentally, both meals were $12 including coffee. They have all the usual breakfast choices, and an Indian omelette which I might try on my next visit. I didn't really notice much of the rest of the menu, but I think they have sandwiches/burgers, pasta, and one of the daily specials was a chicken meal. I also think they are open until 7-8pm during the week. Overall, good food and a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Great tasty breakfast !  We were just passing trough, will definitely come back next time we are in east Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of all day breakfast places and I have to say that this place is subpar at best. The service is great but the menu itself is not any more special than any other breakfast place. Sure, they have a wider variety of omelettes than most places but I'm not really a fan of omelettes anyways. The potatoes are good but that's really all I liked. Honestly there are 3 other breakfast places within a 3 minute drive that are better and cheaper. I don't think it was very smart to open near them. I don't mean to  bash the restaurant, it's a decent place for a standard breakfast, but it's just not for me."}
{"text":"I cant say enough about Sunny Up..As a contractor, I visit many family restaurants and bars that are in the area of my job site. I have never written a review in my life.. I have been working at the 'May stone' plaza on Kingston for about a week now. All of my crew just love this place, morning, noon and afternoon the meals are always perfect. The perfect portion for a hungry mason.. Spring onions and little green peppers in the home fries, why didn't I think of that? Bacon done perfect every time (Feels like someone in the kitchen really cares about the quality)..  The chef and his wife are the SALT OF THE EARTH kind of people, and the waitresses are not bad on the eyes either..  As a hungry man I would highly recommend this place to anyone.  Ive been everywhere and these folks fed me well.. Very well.. They are also LLBO.. For a small cozy place there are a lot of tables and I notice a lot of repeat traffic going in and out everyday as we work outside.. I feel that this place has been a diamond in the rough for a long time, but have a look at it now, the plaza is being transformed and Sunny Up is still serving up the same high quality grub..  If you don't believe me check it out..   Tell the chef that the masons who did the stone columns outside sent you :)"}
{"text":"They weren't lying when they said Scarborough was the hub of good ethnic food. While this place isn't very \"ethnic\", it is run by lovely Srilankan people and they have INDIAN STYLE OMELETTE!! (pronounced aamlate back home), I have not seen it anywhere else. It is made with Green Peppers, and green thai chillis, tastes exactly like back home.  I ordered their Egg florentine Benedict with Turkey Bacon and it was one of the best eggs Benedict I've ever had.  Oh and yes, the home fries were actually out of this world as some one else said. It was more like stir fried potatoes (Similar to Aalo Bhaji). All of us loved the fries.  Pancakes were meh and they also don't carry maple syrup. The service was pretty good considering a lot of places were closed due to ice storm, I also met the chef, very humble Srilankan woman."}
{"text":"I've been here before and had a wonderful experience. This one was so far from it. It's a bit awkward when you're ignored by staff when you walk in for 3 minutes, especially as it was far from busy. Okay, fine, no big deal. I ordered from a very friendly waiter, steak and eggs. I asked for my steak rare, hoping to get a medium rare. The food came fairly quickly but the steak was completely well done. I immediately told the waiter who took it back no questions asked. Perfect. But then he showed up with my plate, sans steak. He said he didn't want the potatoes to get cold and my steak will be 5 minutes.??? Umm, thanks, but I didn't come to eat potatoes. Then steak. Then bread. He was most insistent about leaving my half full plate for me to get started on. I hadn't realized I was at my Mom's house. I insisted and told the waiter to take it back. I was rude, for sure. When my food finally came back, my steak was overcooked again. Half of it was a fat cap. The eggs had a layer of oil on it that pooled in the middle. The waiter didn't check in the entire time I ate, and never came back to give me coffee. I can't blame the waiter. This place reeks of poor management. The couple waiters were left to their own devices. Their hearts are in the right place, but the owner is checked out. I WAS going to tell people to come here. I won't anymore. The two stars are for the staff."}
{"text":"Upon looking for a place in our West Hill area to do breakfast, we stumbled upon this little dive in a mostly closed up, run down strip plaza.  It looked a little sketchy, but I make a habit of TRYING not to judge a book by its cover.  The inside is quite small, maybe 10 tables and a bit cramped.  The Good - The restaurant serves breakfast ALL DAY, which is always a nice find, especially for a shift worker. - The menu was small, but nice.  There are some lunch & supper options which sounded tasty albeit \"greasy spoon\" type of fare. - The prices were quite reasonable.   Today there were 5 of us - 4 adults, 1 child - the total bill was 39 dollars and we didn't make an effort to eat cheaply. - The homefries were wonderful, nicely seasoned with a touch of onion and green pepper for extra flavour. - Sauteed spinach on the eggs benedict was also a nice touch, but did add $1.00 to the eggs benny price. - Fruit is served on the side of all of the breakfasts, which was quite nice for a cheaply priced little hole in the wall. - For those interested in alcohol, they are licensed under LLBO and have some basic beer/wine choices on their menu.  (I think it was either 3.50 or 4.00 for a bottle of brew)  The Bad - THE SERVICE.  It was horrid, horrid service.  Had the service been different, I would have boosted my rating up by a star or 2.  Now, since this was my first visit, I'm not sure if the horrible service is the norm, or if today was just an off day. - Related to the service - the coffee wasn't served to us UNTIL our meals were up (just ridiculous), they didn't bring the toast until the end of the meal.  The people I was eating with were saving their eggs for the toast to present, and by the time the toast arrived the eggs were completely cold.  The waitress didn't check back on us once, nor did she refill the water glasses.   We had to flag her down to ask for both ketchup and syrup for my sons pancakes.  I'm really not too sure if I will ever be back...."}
{"text":"Needed a quick breakfast before an event, found this one on this app! Excellent breakfast, charming atmosphere, and I know it's a good breakfast spot when those who serve and protect choose the location to start their stressful days! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened. I wanted to give them a chance to iron out the kinks that many new places go through initially. The restaurant is clean (so are the bathrooms), they had lovely holiday decor up (and a real Christmas tree!). We were greeted immediately upon entering. I was happy to see the place was pretty packed. The menu is good, lots of options, reasonable prices. Even though there were only two servers and the owner for the entire place, they stayed on top of things fairly well. Their service has improved as well. I had the crab cakes benedict which were good and came with their homefries (am not a big fan of homefries, but these are good, with pieces of sauteed onion and green peppers) and a slice of cataloupe. Everything is clean, hot and served quickly. My own two complaints - I'd really like to have the option of having a green salad instead of homefries/toast and lose the tacky 80's dishes that are on the far wall. They don't match the decor and don't add anything either. They just make everything look haphazard. But hey, those are really not huge issues. This is the little place that could. Just please add salads to your menu! You get your money's worth and don't feel like you have to sacrifice anything. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The \"all-day breakfast\" is always great--with chopped peppers and onions mixed with chunks of fried potato-- best version of home-fries I've ever enjoyed. The chef is a genius with seasonings. Hubby loves (LOVES!) the fajitas. Their burgers and soups are very good, too. The weekend part-time wait-staff need a little coaching--DON'T bring out the \"Big Breakfast\" one item at a time! Otherwise, the service has been excellent on the numerous occasions we've visited. Lovely people who own/run the place."}
{"text":"Great food and very clean, I could definitely see this becoming a regular brunch spot, especially since it's open early and closes late and orders for breakfast can be taken all day!!!  I had the Florentine and it was very good!"}
