{"text":"Have eaten there a number of times and always enjoy the experience. Was just there on Friday and had a very good lunch."}
{"text":"I've dined at Du Jour twice now, once before attending ACI and the second while in the management class. Both times were outstanding and for the price, you can't beat it. It's all student run, from the waiters to the cooks in the back, sure there are some mistakes made here and there but you have to remember we are all still learning! All in all, it is a great place to come enjoy a great meal with friends and family for a great price, if you haven't been here yet I suggest you make a reservation right now! Also, ask to take a tour so you can see what the school is all about!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Fine dining for a fraction of the price. I always leave happy and full."}
{"text":"The meal started off with an amuse bouche consisting of smoked eel sushi, sided with pickled seaweed, crème fresh and a tasty soy sauce.  The first wine I had was a Chardonnay from California that I was not impressed with.  It tasted watered down and had a lack of flavor. Next came out bread, which was warm, but the butter was hard as a rock.  It was impossible to smear, but it was still delicious.  Appetizer wise I could not decide between the New England Clam Chowder and the Avocado Poached Shrimp Salad, but in the end I went with the \"chowda\".  The clam chowder was served in a warm bowl, but sadly the chowder was only luke-warm.  Besides the temperature it was scrumptious and I could have easily reloaded on an additional bowl.  The second wine I had was the Cabernet Sauvignon, which was also from California.  I enjoyed this wine much more than the Chardonnay.  It was a dry wine.  Before I knew it the Pan Roasted Marinated Chicken Cumberland was being served.  I eagerly dug in and I have to say it was quite tasty.  The chicken was cooked very well and it was sided with an orange demi-glace that was probably one of my favorite parts of the meal.  The chicken was seasoned wonderfully, along with that the skin was crispy and delicious.  The broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots could have been cooked more in my opinion, but besides that I enjoyed them.  They were slightly over seasoned with white pepper though.  Last but not least was dessert.  All four dessert options looked great, but I ended up selecting the crème brulee.  I have no complaints or comments because it was simply delicious.  To close the meal off we were treated to a mignardise.  It was a tasty sugar coated jelly.  The proportion size of all these dishes were spot on and the plating looked great.  I was very impressed with my meal in Du Jour."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with five friends and everyone enjoyed their meals.everything was fresh and cooked to perfection.the chefs are very creative with different items every day.would recommend highly for people looking for a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Had a very good lunch with my classmates yesterday here. The staff is prompt and on top of even the small things like refilling water and replacing your silverware. Price is very good for the amount of food you get. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxed also definitely recommend to treat yourself at least once.."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, atmosphere and service. I have been here several times, each time is better then the last and exceeds expectations time and time again. From the a mouse bouse that changes every few days to the minarde treat that you get with your check. The teachers are kind and knowledgeable about wines. The amazing thing is that the servers are students. The cooks are students. They make me proud to be a student here at ACI. 
If you want a 5 star meal with 5 star service and 2 star prices come to Du Jour restaurant at Arizona Culinary Institute."}
{"text":"Credit yelp once again in helping me find an incredible place to visit that I would've likely never found without the app. French for \"Of the Day,\" Du Jour is a \"classroom\" for students attending the Arizona Culinary Institute and the menu changes daily. They practice all aspects of fine dining including hosting, serving, and of course cooking! Four courses is all, it started with a sushi roll piece paired with picked ginger. Then there was a choice of 4 appetizers and I picked the duck confit salad. It was excellently prepared, tasted delicious, and was portioned just right. For my main course, I chose the chicken mole with a blue corn masa. The mole sauce was spicy and amazing! Last but not least, there was dessert. Another choice of four to pick from, I went with the chocolate peanut butter cake. It was wonderful and hard to stop eating despite being full. 

The service was great, the atmosphere was quiet, and the food was amazing. To top it all off, the prices were about half of what they should've been at any equal quality restaurant. We didn't get beer or wine, just iced tea, but the bill came to less than $40!! Big credit to all the students. They did a great job! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The school is great. The service is very nice. Depending on the person you get for your server the service is great.

I really love that they can put out great food, fine dining food. I had a Tomatillo Coulis which was fantastic. The Wine they suggested went pleasant well with Appetizer that I got which was  Swordfish Consomme. The Chardonnay was great. 

The free bread and Butter Rose was amazing.

And my Steak was smothered in a mushroom sauce. My Steak was Medium Rare, perfect.  

Also ask for a tour of the school, its awesome! Super awesome. And asked to sit by Baking window to watch the students make our bread!!!!!"}
{"text":"Du Jour is short customers for lunch today! Please come and help us learn. Great food, great service, great price and the knowledge you were there when a career began!"}
{"text":"Came to visit one our friends who is currently in school. We had such a nice time. We were able to share amongst the table and everything we tried was delicious. Highly recommend that people go check out these future culinary superstars."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times before...and I don't think I have ever left upset,  I've always enjoyed my meals, but this time I can honestly  say that I enjoyed all of my courses!  

I was with a group of four other girls.  We all started off with the amuse.  It was some sort of sous vide duck on toast.  It was really good.  Next we had our choice out of four starters...I along with three other girls had the sauteed scallop.  So beautiful!  Four out of five of us ordered the beef tenderloin.  It melted in my mouth...It was perfectly cooked.  The only bad thing is that I wanted more! 
 
Finally, you get to chose from four desserts.  I don't like sweets, so I always bring it home to the kids.  But, they are so beautiful!
 
Now for the price...my meal was only $13 for everything!  It doesn't get any better than that.  I also ordered the orangecello for an extra $3.  Well worth it!

Only sad part is that we were the only table there...Makes me sad!  Everyone is missing out.

Our server also took us on a tour of the school afterwards!"}
{"text":"I always love supporting students who offer business services, since usually the services offered are just as top-notch as professionals and are often way less expensive. (For example, I love getting massages at Cortiva Institute and have had many happy hair experiences at Toni and Guy Academy, both in Scottsdale.) My recent lunch at the Arizona Culinary Institute's du Jour restaurant in north Scottsdale, the only student-run restaurant in the Valley, blew me away in terms of presentation, professionalism and taste. And considering my three-course meal--which also included an amuse-bouche, plenty of bread, a chocolate and a soft drink--only ran $15, the classy experience was a steal. Head there now for the best lunch value I've found in a long time.

Du Jour is open weekdays from 11:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m., and students run every aspect of the meal, from greeting visitors at the front of the house, to serving every course. I started with a trio of three chilled vegetarian soups: vichyssoise, gazpacho and sweet pea. I've never had vichyssoise or sweet pea before, and even though I'm not a pea fan, I loved ever bit of the soup. The vichyssoise with pureed potato and leek was so creamy and rich, and I absolutely adored the gazpacho. I'm a bit of a snob because it's a favorite of mine whenever I visit Spain (I've been there six times), and this was just as good as the kind my family makes in Europe.

My entrée was a vegetarian rigatoni, with kalamata olives, capers, carrots, cherry tomatoes, shaved parmesan cheese and a tomato sauce. It was bursting with beautiful colors and tasty flavors and was such a generous portion, I took half of it home.

Dessert was such a fun experience at du Jour. A tray of four delectable items was wheeled out to my table, including carrot cake, chocolate cake and tiramisu. I went for my favorite dessert, tiramisu, and really enjoyed this version. The cream was generous, and the ladyfingers were perfectly textured.

Other entrees included roasted pork loin, grilled chicken and baked cod, and entrees range between $14-$18, a great deal for such a filling three-course meal with all the extras. The ambiance is romantically lit, and the atmosphere was peaceful and perfect for unwinding.
Besides lunch on weekdays, the Arizona Culinary Institute also features special events such as dinners and wine flight schools. August dinners at du Jour are Tuesday, August 25, through Thursday, August 27, and reservations are taken from 6:30-7:45 p.m."}
{"text":"Du Jour is an absolutely wonderful experience! You are served a 3 course fine dining meal by culinary students who prepare and serve the food. There are 4 choices for entree, and the cost is $20 or less. They offered a 4 ounce pour of wine (Malbec or Sauvignon Blanc) for an additional $5. 
I chose a first course of fresh mozzarella and grape tomato salad with basil . Very light and refreshing. For my main course, I selected a delicate halibut entree with a hollandaise sauce that had a hint of curry. It was served with a mix of asparagus and other vegetables. Absolutely delicious ! Dessert was a vanilla bean cheesecake with a Chantilly cream sauce. The coffee with dessert was excellent as well. 
I highly recommend Du Jour for anyone who appreciates fine dining at a fraction of the price you would expect to pay . 
We went for lunch and reservations are required . I believe they are open from 11:30-2:00 for lunch."}
{"text":"I've had several opportunities to eat at Du Jour for both lunch and dinner and must say, I have never left disappointed, their students are classically trained and are top notch! I highly recommend Du Jour to all my friends and family members."}
{"text":"You can get a 3 course meal here for lunch for under $20.  Most entrees are in the mid teens and include appetizer/salad or soup, entree, and dessert.  A selection of bread and butter is available for you to snack on as well.  

Comparing the other culinary restaurants I've eaten at, I'd say this one serves OK food, but the others are better in preparation and taste.  I had the salmon and ravioli appetizer, which tasted OK, albeit too salty due to the salt crust on the salmon, and the ravioli innards leaked out of the pasta into the bowl it was served in, making it look less appetizing.  The entree itself was (poisson rouge) tasted good and was well prepared, but the dessert (black forest cake) mousse was too runny.  

Service from our main waitress was good.  Our water server was probably the most awkward server I've encountered, and he forgot to bring out some items I requested but hey, I give him points for trying.  One thing that was weird was that one of the instructors came over and made a snide remark on how I wanted bread for my dessert because I was trying to finish the last piece of bread on the table (I hate wasting food)."}
{"text":"If you have the time, you can have a truly gourmet meal at a deep discount. 

You must realize first that you are working with students. Everyone from service staff, to the cooks are learning. They provide excellent, friendly service. It may be a bit slow - but again - they are learning!

They proved knowledgeable about the menu, and are able to remark about which items are allergy friendly. Items can also be tailored to the customer. I have a gluten allergy, and while they gave me options, I chose two dishes that were already naturally gluten-free. I had the caesar salad and the red fish poele. 

The salad was crisp and fresh, but didn't have as much cheese as I would have liked. Nor did it have the tang I am accustomed to with greek salads. It was tasty, however!

The red fish did not disappoint. It was perfectly cooked with a crispy skin, albeit questionably presented. The corn ragout and choron sauce complimented it perfectly! 

The desserts had the most impressive presentation. I couldn't have most of them, but I had the pot de creme that accompanied a donut dish. And I must say -- the pot de creme was out of this world delicious! 

They are educated about wine, as well. So bring your refined palate and ask about which wine pairs well with your choice of entreé! There is an excellent pairing ready for every palate.

Come out to Arizona Culinary Institute and give these students a chance. They are happy to work with you. Note that it is reservation only, so call ahead. Especially make sure to call ahead if you have food allergies! They are all very accommodating and you will definitely enjoy your experience."}
{"text":"2nd time to eat lunch and since the chefs are beginning students it was not as good as the first time.  The cream of broccoli soup is really good, the duck confit was a bit salty.  The portion size of the entrees were real little and not worth the price this time.  Also the chef did not prepare the macaroni properly and gave us just plain pasta with boring italian sausage which tasted like ground beef.  also the great ice cream from last time was boring and nothing fancy.  So this time just two stars, will try again for dinner to see if anything changes. Great staff and great bunch of students and the staff prefers if you are honest so they can help the students out"}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner with friends last night at Du Jour - this morning we are still raving about it! The food was fantastic - we each ordered something different, and every dish was presented and prepared perfectly. My son even took pictures of the desserts. He was SO impressed with their appearance and the way they were flambeed at the table, (and lord knows it's hard to impress a 12 year old boy). It felt like we were dining at a 5 star restaurant, I had to remind myself that I was being served by students - it was very hard to tell the difference - well done!!

We were fortunate to be given a tour of the kitchen. I am a Food Network junkie, so to see the actual, behind the scenes of a working kitchen was fascinating! The students and staff put in long hours, but you could tell they all LOVE & ENJOY what they do! My son is already asking to go back, this time for lunch!

We HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant,school to eat at.  If you want fine dining on a budget this is another choice in the valley.  

I have dined here before for lunch and was much more impressed with lunch service.  The number one factor is cost for such a great lunch.

This visit was a dinner reservation and I was happy with my meal.  However the price versus lunch was not worth it for me.  I believe lunch to be the better meal and value here.

The food can be hit and miss, sometimes I am amazed at the food and other times I was just ok with the food.  Still the ok times were better than say a chain restaurant, but that's why its a school.  Different chefs all the time so different results. 

If you are looking for fine dining, great food, lower cost check this place out.  You do have to plan it out because they do get booked up weeks in advance.  Cheers."}
