{"text":"This place had horrible customer service . The manager / owner had me on wait for 10 plus minutes with out even apologizing and was overly rude ... they messed up my last order as well with being 30min late and food was cold....! Places like this need new manager/ better owner-ship because if that was the manager on the phone then contact better Business Bureau ASAP people"}
{"text":"Great place to get breakfast burritos!! Been a few times and highly satisfied every time!"}
{"text":"Called at 5pm on a Sunday to place an order and they said they were done talking deliveries for the day."}
{"text":"The worst burrito I've had in a long time it was a steak bean and cheese burrito was absolutely horrible the steak was some type of mystery meat not even edible borderline borderline dog food."}
{"text":"This is my husbands favorite place to eat but this location SUCKS! By far the WORST Burrito Express. Unfortunately they are the only ones who deliver in our area. They are NEVER on time. The food isn't as well done or put together like the others. I've complained and NOBODY at this location cares. I even ordered to pick up instead of delivery in hopes we could eat sooner and when I got there they didn't have it ready and said they somehow missed it. I was very polite and understanding but they didn't even give me discount or weren't even very apologetic. It's a shame that they treat their customers this way."}
{"text":"So this place is usually decent. Today I got bent over and my money just taken. I got three rolled tacos and got instead, three tiny skinny greasy rolled corn tortillas with one piece of stringy meat and some store bought clay tasting guacamole.  I also ordered a red chile  burrito...lol instead I got a huge tortilla rolled up with maybe a spoonful of Chile that had, and I counted, 6 pieces of meet and 12 pieces of potatoes. I took the tortilla and re rolled it, it ended up being 3 inches long. Wow!!! The taste was unappealing.  Good luck if this is what you serve now. Waste of my time and money."}
{"text":"We are so incredibly disappointed in the quality of the food there.  We've probably ordered from them about 50 times within the last year and their food is usually amazing.  Their chicken tacos were absolutely awful! What happened to the big awesome shells they once  used that made that taco over $2.00 so worth it? Now it's a small tortilla dipped in oil and hardly cooked.  
The rolled tacos use to be huge and amazing, a huge hit for our family.  Now they are tiny, rubbery and frozen tequittos from the grocery store would taste better then the rolled tacos there do now. 
Rice tastes like boxed and beans from a can.  So incredibly sad that what once was our favorite place is now officially the worst place we've ever eaten at in AZ."}
{"text":"Their Steak & Salsa burrito was very very good and really big too. Great & friendly service. We were just in the neighborhood,  but next time I'm in the area, I'll go there again. Great burrito."}
{"text":"We have been going to B.E. for years.  Everything is made from scratch.  The salsa is addicting.  From breakfast burritos to chicken tacos, we love it all.  The staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"Breakfast Supreme is a game changer. Go in and try it. The cook is old and mad, but he is also an artist. This place loves the regulars."}
{"text":"Give it a run. The ole streak, potato and cheese is a real winner. The chicken taco is in second place, but not far behind."}
{"text":"Because they deliver, my son ordered our dinner (what a kid!). All I wanted was a quesadilla (cheese crisp) with grilled onions and guacamole. They refused to add the onions so all I got was a wimpy, barely warmed pair of doughy flour tortillas with cheese between them. The guac was about a Tablespoon of avacado with lime juice. No flavor, less than ordinary, will NEVER eat their food again. If I could rate negative stars, I would!"}
{"text":"I placed a group order today at 11:13 for delivery. Our lunch is from 12:00-12:30 so the hour estimated time seemed reasonable. When I finally called the store at 12:27 to see where our order was the woman who answered the phone was rude and defensive. She had no idea why it hadn't been delivered. I explained we had a set lunch time and it was over and that we would not be ordering from them again. Her reply, we are running a business and only have one driver so do whatever you like sweetheart and hung up. 

To make this already annoying situation worse...when the driver shower up, he gave me $20 cash as instructed by his boss Which came out of HIS tips (I gave it back) How shady, news flash...you want to provide a customer good service refund thier money from your profit not your hard working employees.

The icing on the cake for me was crunchy cold enchiladas...the cheese wasn't even melted. My Dr. Pepper was good though. I give this establishment a HUGH thumbs down and a negative 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty I was pleasantly surprised! The girl who took my order was super nice so I don't understand the bad customer service reviews. Delivery did take a little longer than I expected but the burritos were fresh and the salsa is delicious. The nice delivery girl found our cat stuck in a tree in our front yard...Thanks! Will definitely be ordering again"}
{"text":"Don't go here they will just waist your time got there 20 min before they closed stood at there window for a good 5min while the lady ignored me she finally asked if I wanted to order and than told me they were closed, I will never go to this place again."}
{"text":"I use to go there but but their manager was rude and obviously mad because  I brought the food back,order was wrong and I wanted both items remade...besides the fact I drove 10 miles to go there, 5 miles 2 trips ended up with my money back and no food so I won't be going back there!"}
{"text":"Stopped in there for lunch when I was in town it Was loca. UNFRIENDLY customer service bad food  I'd try another place"}
{"text":"Great for the price. Expect to wait in line for 10-15 mins during lunch and breakfast though."}
{"text":"Amazing red chile burrito!!! I will be working my way thru the menu. Try the red chile burrito, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I grew up on Burrito Express and when I moved away I missed it. When I had the chance to eat at this location I ordered and handed the guy my card and he informs me that they do not take cards and points to a small sign on the bottom of the cash register. That was the only sign. He tells me that I can use the ATM in the store. I told him that I will not pay three dollars extra for my meal. The Internet says they accept cards, as does yelp. Please know this is not correct. A sign on the door would be great."}
{"text":"Delivery: Burrito express is consistently 1h20m  for deliveries (less than 2 miles away from their location). Can anyone explain this!? Are you starting the marinade process when I order!? 4 times I've ordered here, four times I have to call to find out where the delivery person is and once they had to give me discounted food because I had to call them twice after almost two hours.

*DO NOT ORDER AN OFFICE LUNCH NO ONE WILL EAT ON-TIME OR AT ALL (in my case)*

Any delivery driver from this location, speak to your manger. Tell them how much money your loosing in tips, tell them how your customers really don't like freezing cold food for delivery, tell them to knock off the deliveries if they can't handle scoping a pre-made lump of shredded beef onto a tortilla and deliver it in a timely manor. This is your job, it's in your name... burrito EXPRESS. 

I tried. 4 times I've tired to get decent delivery. No more. You've lost a big lunch business customer."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery and guy on the phone stated it would take 35 minutes. Delivery driver couldn't find our apartment even though they have delivered multiple times. Called the store and the guy acted like it wasn't a big deal. We had to literally walk to a spot at our apartment complex where the driver was. All in all it took an hour and a half and we had cold food and missing item.

EXTREMELY disappointed. We have ordered numerous times, it's a shame this place lost it. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love myself a big manly sized burrito. Filled to the brim with hot fresh meat.  Nothing better than that! I highly recommend this restaurant if you are a breakfast burrito lover.  I had the supreme."}
{"text":"The staff was nice, but the food was not authentic whatsoever. The only reason I was able to eat half of my food was because I was hungry. I don't recommend this place if you're looking for authentic burritos - or Mexican food in general."}
{"text":"I went to the Scottsdale location on Hayden. Huge mistake!! First, the express in their name should be removed as fraudulent, it took forever. Very little seating and all of it was filthy. I ordered the Chorizo and egg burrito. The chorizo was cooked beyond burned, it was charred. It smelled burnt when they gave it to me, I opened it up and the egg was burned too, all charred beyond belief. I took one bite and threw it in the trash and left, I should have thrown it at the idiots that work there. DON'T GO THERE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food for the money, not great but good. Price is cheap, food tastes good but I would stay away from anything with ground beef (seems greasy)."}
{"text":"Best Burritos hands down and their green sauce us what definitely makes this place a home run."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for a couple years and I cannot get enough of it!  I usually get the steak, potato, and cheese burrito it is the perfect amount of saltiness and flavor then add the green sauce!  The chicken tacos are another favorite...they're spicy but not a its so hot I cannot eat it spicy; it is more of a flavorful spicy.  I really wish they would jar up some of that green sauce and sell it.  I would eat my own arm in it (maybe I am exaggerating a little).  
Now as far a service...they're not there to wait on you.  You order it they call it out and you get it.  I have been back over and over and will continue to do so!!! 

P.S. They only accept cash now."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!  This is not an authentic mexican place.. this place takes for ever to sirve the food and the food is not even good.   Worst burrito place ever!!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular here since Sergio started years ago. Always happy with my food. Even came back after finding a bolt from the frying pan in my burrito.

Today might have been the last time i try to place a order with you guys. If your too busy to take a phone order. Say you are too busy. Hanging up the phone multiple times to get the ringing to go away is very uncool."}
{"text":"Check out the new location!!! Excellent breakfast burritos!!! Amazing staff. They also deliver 8am-2:30pm."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are awesome, one of the best in the city. Only tried a few of the regular menu items and they were ok but not as good as their breakfast. Steak burrito was too salty for my taste and the nachos were nothing special. I recommend you pick up your food rather than delivery because it usually takes a while."}
{"text":"There are MUCH better options around town for burritos. I paid $9 for a carne asada burrito and it was..... Edible? That's about it. About as boring as I could have imagined. Honestly, filibertos does a better asada. 

Suggestion for the owner: Don't charge extra if people want some jalapeños on their burritos, you look stingy and cheap as hell. A GIANT container of your canned jalapeños is about $5 at Costco or SAMs club. Lame."}
{"text":"Breakfast Burrito paradise! You have to add cheese to most of their burritos which is lame, but the taste and quality is excellent."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Not even a chance to try the food. Came for a burrito, their hours said they close at 9pm online and posted on the door. It's now 8:20. We went inside (door was open) and they said they couldn't help us because they were closed. They changed their hours to 8pm as of May 1st. They've had almost a month to change their sign! I guess we don't need to go back."}
{"text":"My opinion of the food and service has not changed. But they have gotten a bad habit of not opening on time. Sometimes up to 2 hours late!"}
{"text":"If I could rate zero stars I would! Horrible customer service! I ordered an item off their POSTED menu and was charged more for said item. I was told prices went up, even though the menu was in plain sight. Rather than honor the posted price, I was told I could do whatever I wanted, it was \"her business\" and she could run it however she wanted. I will NEVER go there again! RUDE!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the very best breakfast burritos you will ever have, under $5
huge filling and always cooked perfectly......fantastic~~"}
{"text":"Got a flyer for this place on our door and decided to give it a try.  Worst red chili mix burro, ever!  I also ordered an iced tea and the cashier pulled it out of the fridge...  I honestly think the tea was a few days old.  Not sure how this place has two locations... I will never return."}
{"text":"There's nothing like a fat burrito on a Saturday morning!!

I love a good burrito when I'm hungover, and I don't like to walk into a crowded shop and wait 20 min for it. This BE is small and fast. They have tables outside, and they are hooked onto a gas station which is majorly convenient. 

They also have a pretty good size delivery area, AND no delivery charge... love it. Get the green salsa, its mild but awesome.

I haven't tried a burrito from here that I didn't like; the only downfall is that they are closed Sundays, and weekends are my chill food days."}
{"text":"Don't do it.! Not even close to the \"...Birtos\" family or anything similar! Teenage kids serving canned goods on tortillas. I wanted to like it and cannot. Counting the days this place can stay alive."}
{"text":"I called if for delivery and was told they stopped at 5:30pm on a Sunday, the time was 5:25pm. Other places continue ten minutes after posted times simply for good customer service. Fail Burrito Express.
 I go to the shop after being told I will not going to  receive a delivery and as I walk in the same women is taking a delivery order 5:40pm on Sunday. Fail Burrito Express. 
I get home with my order and what do I find, a hair approximately 8 inches long and red, matching the women who refused delivery and appeared to be running the shift. Fail Burrito Express.
Sunday, 10/28/2012, night crew Failed for Burrito Express."}
{"text":"I am horrified by the treatment I had today. They mixed up an order and just set the phone on the counter. I wanted to order two more of the correct ones, I was even willing to pay for them. I'd call back and they'd set the phone on the counter. I'd call from a different phone and they would make some bad remark right before they picked up the phone. This went on for about 30 minutes. I believe I called about 5 times and they would just say please hold and set the phone on the counter. When I would call back they would say they were 100% sure they did the correct order and then he'd set the phone on the counter! I'm so shocked and have never been treated this way before. I called another location, they apologized (it's a family run business) and the daughter said \"let me guess which location\". I guess the brother is a horrible manager and they get complaints regularly. When I read here about the threats, I wish I would have read the reviews before ordering. Now I'm fearful too. I called the other location where the owner works and he was out a food truck event, but spoke with a manager in training who took down all the info, kept apologizing and said he would do what he could. I'm going to call back the owner next week and make sure he hears exactly what happened. I'm just in total shock right now at how poorly we were treated. Don't give this location your business."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and delivery always comes quicker then they say! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Long time Arizonian I have been coming to burrito express for over 10 year its one of the best Mexican food restaurants in the state. For speed and quality you can beat it."}
{"text":"When I saw the Ace Hardware across the street was gone, I was worried for Burrito Express.  I used to eat there regularly when I lived in Mesa, and was looking forward to enjoying it again.  I was relieved when I rode my bike up into the plaza and saw they are still open for business.  There's no bike rack, but they let me wheel my bike inside.  The guy behind the counter couldn't have been less helpful if he tried, but I eventually found the enchilada combo on the menu and ordered up.  These enchiladas are second only to Carolina's, as far as I'm concerned.  Their beans used to be too salty for me., but on this visit, they were quite tasty.  I like their red salsa a lot.  They get an extra star for serving fountain Pepsi; that's standard Yelping procedure for me."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's tasty,cheap and the burritos are huge. I love the chicken enchiladas  And they pretty much won me over when I heard that I can get it delivered!Even better I can get breakfast burritos delivered too! When the food comes its always piping hot."}
{"text":"We were in town for a few days and wanted a quick bite. 

What a mistake - the staff was rude and seemed like asking questions about the various items was an insult to them. They seemed more interested in their cell phones than the customers.

When the food finally came, it was disappointing, and believe it or not Taco Bell would have been a better choice, and a Chipotle would blow their doors off. 

Never again!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting prices are fair but from past experiences I will not eat at this place again. Their pots and pans are dirty, their deep fryer looks like it's never been cleaned. The manager is rude to her own employees and has a unprofessional way of portraying herself to customers. This place is not authentic plus it's dirty looking all around . I do hope the health department does an inspection."}
{"text":"Tried the breakfast supreme burrito and it was delicious! Definitely plan on going back and trying more."}
{"text":"I must down grade this place to 1 star because I feel I was ripped off. I ordered the Burrito Supreme. The menu indicated it included shredded beef or chicken beans, onion, and tomato for  $4.95. I also made it a combo and added a small drink. When I paid my bill was a whopping $10.53 but I paid it. The person ringing me up did not give me a receipt. When I got my food I asked for a receipt. After reviewing the charges, I noticed I was charged an additional $1.75 for adding shredded beef. WTF! There is no mention of this charge on the menu. I mean really! Was I supposed to pay $4.95 for a been burrito? Come to find out the so called manager is the one who ripped me off. She not only ripped me but she refused to refund the overcharge. She claimed they just replaced the menu board and she was ringing up as she was suppose to. What a line of BS. She is a liar and a thief! I would avoid this place if I were you."}
{"text":"This place has great burritos and quick service !!!! The supreme burrito is the best !!!! I recommend this place to everyone ! The owner / manager is awesome ! He is polite funny and has great customer service skills ! You won't be disappointed !!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped at the Gilbert location on Sat night (March 28th). We were on our way home and wanted to get something to take home. We looked up the store hours and their website said they were open until 9:00 pm (so does the sign in the window). We went inside to order and it was 8:35 pm. The employee at your counter asked if we had ordered ahead of time. We said we had not. He told us that they were closed and could not serve us. There were people inside eating, but he said that the store was closed. I checked the window again and the time on my phone and we were there almost 30 minutes before the 9:00 Pm.  The employee acted like we were crazy for wanting to order food. 

Normally I would not write a review about this, but this is the second time this has happened to us at their Gilbert location.   Not sure why they post business hours if they will not serve for the hours posted."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I loooove coming here every other weekend or so just for the breakfast burrito supreme! Literally nothing else, it's a weakness.   However, I do agree with most reviews here, that blonde girl in the front kills our experience every time without fail. Word on the block is that she's the owner's wife and that's why she's some sort of management and definitely not going anywhere. What do I know though?   Still going to keep coming here for our biweekly indulgence despite cranky pants up front."}
{"text":"As a plumber I've been to a lot of Mexican food places in the valley. Burrito Express on Hayden has the best shredded beef tacos I've had in a long time!!"}
{"text":"Good food! But when I ordered the burrito enchilada style and had it delivered ...my sauce spilled all over everyone else's food too! No bueno. Taste and delivery was great!"}
{"text":"15 dollar minimum for average food. Placed the order about 5:15 on a friday night, and driver got lost, called to confirm address. Finally arrived around 6:15. Boyfriend ordered salsa burrito, which he says was good, and enjoyed. I ordered the rolled tacos. Was not impressed. May try again in the future since it wasn't horrible, but also wasn't amazing."}
{"text":"its real basic, i've gotten burnt beans, and they only take cash, and they look mad at me when they gotta take my order. Its all family owned and ran, hope it gets better."}
{"text":"I found a dead fly in my nachos...I'm very disappointed and grossed out because I've ordered from them multiple times..."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Burrito Express many times. I love the food, however....the last time I ordered from them, I found a dead fly in my nachos...grooss!!!"}
{"text":"So the food is on par with every other burrito place, that is not the issue. 

The people here are just bad. The service is consistently slow, the people are not friendly and they dine in section is not very clean.

I honestly have no idea why they even bother with delivery. They have a $15 minimum, which is way too high and then they estimate an hour delivery and you should feel lucky if it gets there in under 2 hours. I am about 3 miles away and it still takes a really long time to get your order. The worst part about that is if you call and complain, they make the driver pay you out of his tips which I 100% do not agree with. 

Read the reviews, we aren't all lying. The service is really THAT bad."}
{"text":"Ok, to make this short and sweet.  The food isn't too bad but the service is terrible. This guy,  I'm guessing the manager is rude and very unprofessional. I won't be back!!!"}
{"text":"We used to love over in Tempe and ordered from the burrito express off alma school and Elliot; we were bummed when we moved but then quickly got excited when opened up Gilbert.  We've ordered from here a few times and usually not so bad, expect for today.  Whoever answered the phone seemed extremely annoyed to be working, literally felt like I was bothering her.  Then we ordered a combo meal and asked for green sauce on an enchilada (btw I completely understand there is no substitutions) but since the sauce type isn't listed I really didn't expect that to be a problem...apparently it is.  To be honest it wouldn't of been that big of a deal but both the employee and manager were extremely rude.  Needless to say you have lost a pretty loyal customer! Step it up guys!"}
{"text":"Ordered for for delivery for lunch and two hours later...NO FOOD!  Horrible customer service.  We called to check on the delivery 20 minutes passed their estimated delivery time and they said they were on the way.  Forty minutes later, we called again.  They hadn't even started the order yet.  Needless to say, we cancelled our order.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, great flavor and personable service. My husband and I were fans from our first visit. Since we live nearby we are regulars. If more of our neighbors would go more regularly they would stay open later in the day. So, neighbors...go and give it a try.  This is not your greasy, overly bland excuse for Mexican food.  This is fast, fresh and tasty!!!
Try their breakfast burrito with chicken or steak, YUM!!!"}
{"text":"First: Get the chicken tacos. They are the bomb. The chicken is spicy and delicious. Love it. 
Their beef and bean burrito enchilada style w/ green sauce is also awesome. 
The people who work here are friendly...oh and they also have awesome hot sauce. 
I love this place!"}
{"text":"The cash only thing kinda sucks but there food is AWESOME."}
{"text":"you know its gonna be good when parked in front are nothing but work trucks! the landscape workers were there, the guys who fix air conditioners, and a plumbing contractor. i even saw a jack-in-the-box employee from across the parking lot eating there! sure enough, i had the chorizo, egg, and potato burrito. soooo good!  the red salsa that comes with it was fantastic! plus the guy at the counter ask me if i was a new customer and when i said yes, he gave me a free fountain drink. how nice. been there two other times since. this is the best place to go when you want a good old fashion big-ass burrito. tasty!"}
{"text":"Good burritos bad business practice. They don't always open or close at posted times. They don't answer phones and often when they do say hold set it down and never come back. It reminds me of a group of people that don't care about doing their job well"}
{"text":"DONT GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS!!! I am amazed that they are in business after the way they treat customers.  We called in an order for the office like we have before.  When we noticed the price was higher than normal we called back to ask if there was a charge we weren't seeing or something and just wanted to figure out what we weren't seeing.  The guy that answered the phone didn't say \"let me get my manager\" or anything like that, he just put the phone down.  We weren't sure if we were disconnected or what. Then the manager picks up and says \" I'm the manager, what do you need\"?  What manager talks like that to a customer.  When we explained what we were trying to figure out he just said, \"I'm losing business. I'll cancel the order.\" I wasn't sure if he was playing around and kind of chuckled and said I don't want it cancelled, I am just trying to figure out the price. He responded with \"Order cancelled\".  How absolutely insane to think you can treat a customer like that.  This will go to the BBB and someone like that has no business running a business.  Also, if you think the 5 star reviews are credible, look at their other reviews.  They get 1 star because I don't have the option to give 0."}
{"text":"Just like all the others cheap cheap cheap.  Don't expect too much. Its all in the name. 

Fast and cheap. Plain, good and tasty, you get what you pay for. Not large portions and sides, notice the lettuce in the pictures.   Many hard working men and women eat here.  Construction and work trucks fill the parking lot.  Says a lot"}
{"text":"It's a small place but it has amazing food! Must try and the green sauce I love it so much I ask for 5 little case of the green sauce with one burrito. Must try this place! Bomb shit!!"}
{"text":"I love coming here! It may not be the best looking place, but what it lacks in appearance it makes up for in taste!! Allllll of the associates are friendly! They always make great recommendations and never mess up my order!! (which is big because I'm so picky!)"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!! First they can't get the number of how many tacos I want correct, then why add lettuce to the side when I specifically say NO LETTUCE because I am allergic.  Yes, it is a stupid allergy but it is an allergy just the same!  Whenn I called to enlighten them they hung up on me!  Never going back!"}
{"text":"Ripped me off an enchilada & said no way he could have made mistake. What?  Back talk over an enchilada?really?  Emailed corp office, no response. I will never waiste my time or money on this place ever again."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff. Super clean establishment, and the burritos were absolutely amazing. I've had some great breakfast burritos in Arizona but this place is definitely close to the best if not the best."}
{"text":"We were regulars up to this point. Very disappointed. We called at 6:13 pm to place an order. We were told we would receive a call back for payment. At this point we were given no information on our order. We called at 6:40pm to check on the order and spoke to Oscar. He said he was very busy and our order was being cooked. After a short conversation I was under the impression he was to busy for my business. When I requested cancelling the order he hung up on me. I called back and requested the owners name. Jackie was the name I was given. He said I spoke down to him. At no time did I complain cuss or yell at Oscar.  I asked him what he needed from me to complete the order. I do not feel my response due to the lack of communication on his part warranted a dial tone. I would never hang up on a customer. I will be calling the owner. With this kind of customer service I recommend going elsewhere. We will be crossing them off our list for delivery. I suggest a refresher for Oscar concerning customer relations.  I hear Filibertos is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"You want quick mexican food then this is the spot for you.  potato burrito and the carne asada burritos are classics.  can't go wrong with anything really.  

tip:  as with all mexican or spicy food make sure you order the horchata to avoid a messed up stomach.  akaline drink neutralizes the acid in your stomach."}
{"text":"i am not sure if any of you try the deivery . It's a damn joke. The person that takes your order has very poor communication skills and it takes forever to get the food. The driver was pleasant but the food was cold and the order was wrong. This is the 3rd time I have tried to order fro here. EVERY time it has been like trying to order from a monkey."}
{"text":"I have been going here since 2009. The place is amazing, I can however only vouch for their steak, potato, cheese burrito and their breakfast burrito. Their steak, potato cheese is 5 stars! The breakfast one is only about a 3.5. But their green sauce is where it's at. It makes the burrito so much more delicious than it already is. I use to go twice a week if not more lol."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try Burrito Express since it was right down the way. The first time we were fairly pleased but the meat was quite salty. The second time, my boyfriend went to pick us up dinner on a Friday night around 6pm. While there were people inside, both doors were locked. My boyfriend got the attention of one of the workers who nodded/acknowledged he was there but then looked away and did nothing. There were two signs saying OPEN and the hours were posted until 9. Truly, why choose to go out and pay to get average food with rude/disrespectful service. There will be no 3rd attempt. After the reviews on a whole, this is not uncommon for them."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent customer.
For the last 3months it has been getting steadily worse. Smaller portions, burnt tortillas, today was the last time. 
I might have an egg in my breakfast burrito. I have torn off almost half a tortilla. Time to find another favorite breakfast burrito spot."}
{"text":"My god I love this place! Great food, best tortillas, and a very cool staff. Loving the all day breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Incredibly rude staff. Getting a delivery is horrible. They state they have a 5 mile radius and I'm exactly 5 miles away and they still won't deliver. I wish they would quit leaving their signs on my door if they won't deliver to me. Waste of paper!"}
{"text":"I love burrito express we live in Colorado and had to come in town for the day. I had to go get some green chilli burritos to take back to Colorado with me!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years. They have the best breakfast burritos and green chili burritos. The meat in the green chili is very tender and tasty. The customer service is always very personable. I love that they keep the prices reasonable and the portions generous!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for over three years and while the service has been up and down, the food has stayed at a 4-star level. We have had just about everything on the menu between myself, my wife and our daughter, There have been some misses, but after reading some of the negative reviews before me, I wonder what standards these people are applying.. It is a chain burrito place, not Pampano in NY. Yes they still only take cash, but they have an ATM. Like any place you go to eat, you should give it two tries before condeming it. Oh and RIck S, thanks for the review, but I'm guessing you have turned more people off with teh update, so I hope you don't go any other places I like."}
{"text":"Got the steak breakfast burrito. It wasn't the greatest breakfast burrito but it was very good! Service was good, wait was 5-7 minutes but it was during the breakfast rush. I have nothing bad to say! I'll be back again to try another one!"}
{"text":"Love the steak and potato burritos with the red sauce. They will make it to order so expect to wait a few minutes for your order to cook."}
{"text":"Average semi-fast Mexican fare and really that's disappointing in a city overflowing with Mexican restaurants. I'm afraid we won't be going back."}
{"text":"After receiving a flyer placed on my screen door, I call this location and spoke to a male who refused to give me his name as I requested that they not put their flyer in the screen door as it may punch a hole it in. This \"manager\" told me that he could not do anything about it as it was a third party and he didn't have time for this. 
I would suggest that we do not do business with this location or perhaps any Burrito Express as if this is the way they handle business issues what do they do with the food we buy from them. They just don't care and we should and take our dollars else where."}
{"text":"Manager was incredibly rude. My tortilla was cold. I asked if I could get a hot tortilla. She said it would cost money. I said I didn't see why I should have to pay if my current tortilla is cold and it's normally hot when I go there. She once again told me I would have to pay. I ate my cold burrito instead of paying.

On the way out I ordered a burrito to go. I asked if they could make sure the tortilla is hot because the last one was cold. She ran my card and told me they will make it the same way they always do. I said I didn't want it made the same way as last time because the tortilla was cold. She told me I was being ridiculous. I said that I wanted to cancel my order and a get a refund since I did not want the same quality food as last time. The cook had not even started my order yet. She refused. She did not refund my money. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Simple 
Delicious burrito
You can tell they are fresh and red salsa is amazing 
It's like other basic Mexican restaurants Salsa"}
{"text":"This place should be called 'Burritos while you wait 40 minutes\". Come on guys, 40 minutes to make a damn bean and cheese burrito? No wonder all the reviews say you are a joke when it comes to customer service. Rightfully so, the burritos are not even that great. Who is working back in kitchen? Hire some more people! Preferably ones that know how to roll a burrito. My 92 year old grandma can make 400 of those burritos in her sleep in 40 min. Never again."}
{"text":"We were really impressed.  Great food and quality.   We will be eating here often.  They even deliver.  Awesome!  Totally recommend"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but there are no limes for the tacos. The burritos i find to be too salty. I would give more stars but the customer service is awful."}
{"text":"What a mess,  1 person running the place and people walking out in disgust at the crappy service."}
{"text":"This place is great! A burrito shack & circle k gas in one stop! Where else can you stop and get gas for yourself and your car in one stop? Fill up your car and try the breakfast burrito supreme...you & your car will be gas-ed for the whole day."}
{"text":"First visit, sign says get 10th burrito free. Asked for a stamp, guy said no since I used a coupon , you can only get a stamp if you pay full price. Good way to lose new customers, last visit there."}
{"text":"Ordered no meat, all vegetable burrito and got served extra bacon burrito. A very insincere apology and no compensation. Filibertoslike service."}
{"text":"I always love Burrito Express food. I used to only go to the Gilbert location but now I'm closer to this one. Well I just went for the first time and food is great but that young guy at the register is so rude! Worst customer service! The manager should rethink having him in the front."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast burritos. The dinning area is not much and you can see the kitchen. You don't go there for the dinning experience you go there to get great food and leave."}
{"text":"Love my burritos. love Burrito Express I always come here at Tempe spot. great atmosphere, friendly. Great customer service. the food is always on point. I would definitely recommend Burrito Express to everybody."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and of course they get the order wrong after correcting him twice on the phone.  Food pretty much sucked. Would not call it authentic or fresh. Burritos were dry. Your better off going to taco bell.  Never will go here again."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. I will go out of my way for their food. The green sauce that they make is the best. There is only one employee that I will now turn around and walk out after today's visit in the afternoon.  Everyone but this guy is awesome.  He was so rude, today especially.  If someone doesn't like customer service work they should get out of it. Instead he causes a bad write up for what is normally a great experience. I would have given a 4 or 5 stars but for this one employee today 9/6/15"}
{"text":"$$
You'll get your moneys worth here. Burritos the size of your arm, and they got one the size of your leg! The atmosphere is colorful and fun.
Service is quick and prompt.

(Not SUPER earth-friendly, they love their styrofoam unfortunately....)"}
{"text":"First got hooked on Burrito Express at the Elliot location. I was stoked when they opened up a location in Gilbert. Same great food. Kind of a hole in the wall place but the salsa and horchata are to die for!"}
{"text":"Any company that would write disparaging messages on a customer's receipt should be run out of business. what are you like 3 years old"}
{"text":"On the side of a gas station so not the ideal location  but they make some great burritos. No inside seating only a few outside picnic tables. High quality tortillas with your classic red(spicy) or green(mild) salsa choices. 1 is enough for a burrito 2 if you really like salsa. Breakfast supreme is a go to with eggs potatoes ham and bacon but not the fastest turn around time so don't be in a hurry"}
{"text":"I would give this location a better rating but they skimp your burritos here. Visit ANY of the other BE locations and compare the burrito sizes. I even brought this up to the employees attention and the guy with the nasty beard justified it but proclaiming lower food cost. Well no shit, you skimp the burritos. I just wish I didn't have to drive all the way to chandler and Gilbert because this location is a few miles from my house. The nasty beard guy was fired and they hired a nasty red head with the worst attitude ever. Look at the kitchen as well. NASTY!!!"}
{"text":"Straight out this place sucks - no care in the food they prepare - everything is over salted wrapped in a tortilla - they use store bought sauces - las Palma's and Macayos red sauce - beans are watery and tasteless - 3 roll tacos w/cheese and guacamole should be a safe thing to order NOPE my dog would not touch them (Costco has better frozen ones) - if you want diarrhea for 3 days go to this place - personally I would pay 5 dollars more and go to Los Fav's or Tosinos - plus the cocky asshole that runs this place and the Alma School location should buy my family and I a bottle of Pepto and a package of toilet paper - because of his lack of service not only did he lose my family's business but my kids school spring festival catering"}
{"text":"Went there today,  although I was hesitant due to bad reviews I wanted to give it a try.Food was ok, nothing special. Lady taking orders was not pleasant. There were no customers when we got there but yet every single table was dirty and there were no napkins. Will not go back. To many other places to choose from."}
{"text":"This has always been my favorite I love you green salsa you are my best friend lol. But for real I love this place"}
{"text":"Great food! Great prices and an all around great atmosphere! I always get the loaded nachos! Minus the spicy chicken. I know, I know, who doesn't love spicy??? I do for sure! But this chicken is just a bit too spicy for this chick! It's in a great location, the staff is super friendly and it looks as if it's a family run location! I could be wrong but anyhow, I highly recommended this place!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why everyone likes this place so much. This place is called burrito express and we had to wait like 20 minutes to get our food, with no one in front of us. I got the steak and salsa burrito my fiance got the machaca burrito. His was like 3 times the sizes of mine and my cheese wasn't even melted. My burrito wasn't terrible but it wasn't good. My fiance's burrito was so disgustingly greasy he couldn't even finish it and he loves greasy food, we wouldn't even want to give it to our dog. It looked disgusting! He just threw the other half away and felt sick the rest of the day. We ordered some chips and salsa and they threw a couple table spooned size salsa containers in the bag, which wasn't enough for the chips. We asked for more and they charged us extra for each salsa! The salsa tasted terrible! They also charge you extra for using a credit card. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The burritos are good enough when you're craving breakfast and can't get away from work. I use them about once every couple of weeks. The service our horrible. Almost every time I call I get put on hold only to never get answered. I call back and finally get my order in. If there was another place that delivered I would go there."}
{"text":"I need to preface this 1 I love spicy Mexican food 2 I have eaten Mexican food all around the United States. This is not my first rodeo is what I'm trying to say As I walked in the door the manager shuffle his feet quickly to meet me and take my order. He greeted me with a smile and made me feel real comfortable kind of like an old friend. I asked what was in the Machaca burrito he was very detailed as to all the ingredients I was really quite impressed. I was impressed that he knew all the ingredients and that he wasn't upset or short with me for even asking. I asked for it to be spicy and it was perfect I had the green enchilada style my machaca burrito I had spicy green salsa everything was wonderful fresh and tasty I would highly recommend!!!! It only took 4 min to get my food. :-)"}
{"text":"I really like their breakfast burritos. They have a good tortilla and the salsas are flavorful."}
{"text":"Three burrito minimum?!...I have been eating here for years and I love the food however the customer service has only gotten worse as time goes on. I started with delivery until it got to the point where it was 2 hour delivery times when they say 45 minutes and always messed up the order. So I switched to pick up orders and now as of the 1st of January you cant even call in your order to be picked up unless you order 3 burritos. Blatantly to force customers who don't want to go in to order and sit there and wait for their food to be made. Will no longer be recommending this place to anyone after years of recommendations."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Supreme is the best breakfast burrito that you will ever have!!! Great location with great people!"}
{"text":"I used to somewhat like the food here until last night. It was disgusting. My kids wouldn't even eat it, and I didn't blame them. The rolled tacos were the same as the frozen ones at the store but cooked weird and tasted bad. The STP burrito (number 1 seller) tasted like hose water. The hard tacos were so greasy they were soft. I'm not sure what happens here but it's terrible now and I'll be eating at Taco Bell from now on."}
{"text":"Stopped in today with my boyfriend and our 6 year old.  I ordered the green chili burro chimi style.  Sour cream and Guac on the side.  As I cut into my burro, it literally deflated.  My curiosity led me to open the chimi, where I found 5 cubed pieces of green chili beef. 5. 5 quarter sized piece of meat in a full size tortilla.  I ordered the burro chimi style cause I like a crispy shell.  This was not the case.  After finishing my 5 with meat bites, I ate mushy tortilla with some semi par green chili sauce, and ONLY because I hadn't eaten all day, and I am pregnant.  And for $7, I couldn't throw it away.  But I will never buy it again.

My boyfriend and the wee one both had shredded beef tacos. Nothing terrible, pretty decent, I would of rather had the tacos.  He originally wanted a shredded beef burrito, sans beans.  The guy looked at him and rather rudely replied 'well we can do it but the burrito won't be big...'  Seems like a pattern here.  In addition... if you're charging me for a steak burrito, I don't want a bean burrito with some steak in it, I want a steak burrito with some beans in it.  If your informing customers that without the \"filler\" it won't be much of a burrito... it isn't a good sign.

They also don't take credit or debit which is a huge pain.  It wouldn't be as bad if they had an ATM, but they don't, so we had to order based on the little cash I had in my wallet.  

We got my meatless fake chimi, 6 tacos and 1 soda for $21.  The tacos were not that big.  Skip it.  Or drive the block or so extra to Rosita's."}
{"text":"Good food, clean, polite service 
Just enjoyed another bacon breakfast burrito. It was delicious"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, but the woman in charge of this location is extremely rude and doesn't care about customer service. I've been coming to this place for 8+ years and it was always an amazing experience until the management changed. Same owners, just a different manager. She's rude so be prepared to be served some major attitude with your amazing meal! I'm going to the other Burrito Express from now on."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!!! I was the ONLY person in this restaurant and  five people in the back kitchen area completely ignored me at the counter until I finally yelled something back at them, even though they had all made eye contact with me several times before that. Seriously the nerve. Once I talked to the not so bright guy that rang me up, I realized that they were all stoned. No thank you, no sorry for the wait, no have a nice day, no nothing to be exact. The food was average at best, Filiberto's is better and at least the staff in those have more than three brain cells!  I hope the staff at all of their locations isn't this bad, because I would seriously have to question how they stay in business!?!?"}
{"text":"While burrito express may not look like the most classy establishments they do make one heck of a great burrito. The tortillas are the best. I don't think they are homemade but thy sure taste that way. I also love their salsa. I think they make big batches and freeze it because it has been a little icy at times but still good. They are quick, polite, and delicious. A weekend repeat for sure."}
{"text":"First - I am addicted to their red sauce. So so good. The prices are excellent and the food here has always been very good and tasty.

Additionally, I have never personally had bad service at the Ray/Gilbert location. This is mainly because I know what I want, order it quickly, and watch/listen for my order when it is ready. I don't ask for discounts or for my food to be brought to the parking lot because I left my baby in the car to come order a burrito or anything outside of the stock experience.

However, every time I come - - - EVERY TIME - - over multiple weeks the past three months, I have witnessed at least one incident of very poor customer service by the counter staff, both the balding guy who says 'bro' a great deal and the blonde woman with dark glasses. They do not appear to have a manager on staff very often - I have heard someone named 'Mark' mentioned but I think I have only seen this person once over six to eight visits. Perhaps over the holidays, the manager was on vacation?

On multiple occasions, I have seen the blonde woman texting while the phone goes unanswered. On at least two occasions, I have heard the guy complaining to the woman using locker room language about a customer who has just left that he did not get along with for one reason or another. I have seen customers come in about orders that were not delivered when promised. I have heard customers call and be upset about waiting excessive time for their orders.

To be fair, I have seen an unusually high number of odd requests from customers as well. I have seen customers argue about a six cent difference between what the menu says and what 'Mark' charges them. I have seen a man come in who left a baby in his car and wanted them to bring the order outside for him. I have seen a woman yell because her order for twelve burritos was taking longer than five minutes when three people had ordered two burritos each just ahead of her. Not sure why their is so much drama here but there seems to be.

If you want a good cheap burrito that is a step above Taco Bell and has the best red taco sauce I have ever had - seriously, I have dreamt about this sauce - and you come into the restaurant versus having it delivered, I think you'll be pleased. If you come in expecting Chipotle or Macayo's quality or want them to do more than make the burrito and then put it on the counter, you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good size and delicious burrito! The staff was friendly and the price is right for the burrito size. The decor is super cute too!"}
{"text":"back already!  My husband had the really spicy beef combo, and I had a chicken enchilada and taco combo.. I must admit, the beef was really tasty.  Spicy, but not overpowering.  the chicken was not really that spicy, they say all their chicken is spicy.
Next time, I'll get the beef too.
good food, smiling service, clean restaurant."}
{"text":"I've grabbed dinner to go here a couple times in the past few months. I was excited to find another inexpensive mexican restaurant close to where I live. Most of their food seems pretty salty...I could live with about half the salt and I like a lot of salt But the spicy beef (#9) lived up to it's name. If you like spicy food I'd highly recommend trying the #9. Considering that Amados is just a couple minutes away, I probably won't try this place again."}
{"text":"Quick fast and dam right delicious! The salsa and the services is off the hook!  Best breakfast burrito in town. If u haven't tried it you don't know what your missing.  This location is the best!"}
{"text":"F this place! Not only does the food suck but these people have no idea how to run a business or know anything about customer service.
Don't give these pieces of trash your business anymore."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!
I use to live in Chandler and when I did I went at least once a week.  It has really good burritos and nachos!  Now that I am in Tucson I like to go there any time I make it back up to Phoenix.  The staff that works there is amazing as well. Super nice!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are always good... The other stuff is Inconsistent. Sometimes ok sometimes just meh. Never terrible though."}
{"text":"Don't come here on Saturday if you anything else to do. Express is a misnomer. Burritos are ok. Servers were nice. I blame management for not having enough staff."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great price...AND they deliver.

I was skeptical of a Mexican joint that delivered, but I decided to try it.  As I usually do, I made a few substitutions and high-maintenance changes to my take-out order.  The man I spoke to on the phone was completely ok with it, and everything came out perfectly.  
The food is authentic Mexican, huge portions, and fairly priced.  I highly recommend this place, and will certainly go back.  
The only reason it does not get five stars from me is because the delivery time is approximately an hour, even if you live close.  I figure if you order before you are starving to death, this will not be a problem."}
{"text":"Our go-to spot for a burrito! Breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Its always delicious. Their rolled tacos with spicy chicken and guac are my favorite too! Killer breakfast burritos and the salsa is EXCELLENT! The staff is always nice too which is a plus because most burrito shops have less than friendly people working!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos!!! I always call ahead for my chorizo egg and cheese---all the guys that work there are really cool"}
{"text":"Was craving a green chili burrito, so I thought I'd try one here at burrito express. What I got was a green chili sauce burrito with only five small pieces of meat in the whole thing. The picture shows the remains of the burrito after sifting through it to try to find a piece of meat. I just threw away what you see in the picture because all that was left was green sauce. The two star rating reflects this experience plus other times I've eaten here and it takes forever to get your order to come out. The one thing they have going for them is their prices for burritos are reasonable. Make sense since they don't use much meat."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Mild Machacha Burrito.  Trust me the hot one is way to hot.  Food is great but owner/staff not to friendly.  Kinda reminds me of the Soup Nazi.  Best to call ahead for your order."}
{"text":"First off, im a first time customer, and, i am amazed, how good my rolled tacos, and my chimi style burro, it was seriously some darn good food, marshal, who helped me was patient when i couldnt make up my mind,friendly also....well i am now, a customer that will definitly not forget this awesome meal... Thank you also to the chef, great job...kathy"}
{"text":"I've been going to the same location for 8 years and I've always gotten good service and food. Sometimes I'll call in my order if I'm really hungry so by the time I get there I can just pay and then sit down and eat. I like the rolled tacos and the chicken tostada is my favorite. It's very spicy but I have sour cream with it the help cool my mouth off."}
{"text":"Great food horrible service. They need to give the young kid some customer service skills he sucks."}
{"text":"I'm loving this place. Friendly staff, freshly made food.  My only complaint would be that when you order hard tacos, and you tell the sous chef that is making the taco she'll that your like them to be harder, more crisp, that you have him remake the shells and not serve the customer a soft corn shell especially in customer listening distance. It was rather disappointing and disgusting to eat. Other than this experience, the burritos are awesome."}
{"text":"The food here looks pretty pedestrian but the meats have more flavor then you expect and make it above average. I personally thought the service was pretty good. Three green salsa and horchata are both excellent. Prices are very fair for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is always great and fresh! Family owned and operated! Been coming here since high school. Try to eat here at least once a week. The green salsa is amazing! Love it when moco is the cook, his burritos are the best!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos, very reasonably priced. The staff is helpful and fast. Thanks for the great food!"}
{"text":"Went here with a Groupon because I wanted to try somewhere new in town! This place was... all right. The staff weren't especially friendly and it felt as though they wanted us out of there as soon as my husband and I finished our food. 

As for the food, I ordered one of their combo plates and it was good! Not the best Mexican I've had, but it wasn't bad either. The beans were great, and it's hard to get me to like fried beans. Definitely the best part of the meal! The rice was meh and the chicken tacos were okay. 

Not a big fan of the atmosphere, though. It looked fairly dirty, I was half-expecting a roach to come crawling across the floor. And I think the place would look much better if they had real matching chairs, instead of assorted lawn chairs.

Probably won't come back here unless we have some sort of coupon, Groupon or otherwise."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after such a long time of driving by and should of just kept driving.  Why call yourself mexican food if you do not use any mexican spices.  We ordered two burritos (steak and shredded beef) and they were fine, but thats the problem. No spice, no flavor and tried both of thier hot sauce bottles but they did not help.  Too be honest, their prices are very good, but spend a bit more and eat Filibertos asada with green sauce."}
{"text":"Ehh.. it's okay. I've tried a breakfast burrito, Red Chile and Green Chile Burrito, more scalding as in temperature than anything. I've had better. They only accept CASH."}
{"text":"If you appreciate spicy food, you'll love the hot machaca burrito! It is awesome!!! You must get it with the green salsa as well."}
{"text":"Have ordered from here numerous times for delivery without an issue. Called today first 3 times and no one answered. Then finally got through and they put me on hold for 8 mins!!!!! I hung up to call back and it went straight to their vm. Do you seriously have only 1 line?! When I finally got through and told them I've been on hold. Their response was \"yeah you were on hold because we are busy\" uh no shit, there's still a level of customer service to be expected. Done ordering from here!"}
{"text":"no idea why this place has less than 4 stars. If you haven't had their breakfast supreme, you're wrong."}
{"text":"MUST READ
Way to go. This place gets great attention for its toxic staff that delivers more trash talk than correct orders. In food service... The customer is king.

{"text":"the only reason I decided to eat at this place was because they delivered. I unfortunately ordered the green chili burito. It hands down had to be the worst burito I have ever tasted.  I called and they sent me back another burito. At first I was happy then I took a bite and it was the same soup filled burito I had received the first time. The only difference was they toasted the tortilla so it was firmer. The delivery driver was rude and expected a tip when he didn't even bring forks or napkins. I will never go to this establishment again. If your looking for better fast burito service go to new Mexican grill. Worst $9.00 I have ever spent. I guess it good if you like a good deal, because I got two awful burito for the price of one......terrible"}
{"text":"Terrible service, the three women in the front were completely uninterested in doing much else than talk about other coworkers with each other, burrito took way too long and I was called to the front to pick up my dine in order which was placed in to go bag when I was the only person there"}
{"text":"BE is our go-to breakfast burrito shop. Best in Phoenix. As evidenced by the long lines (waited 10 minutes on a Saturday even after calling ahead!). Get the red and green salsas and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome steak burrito these guys don't charge enough come get it it's real good food and it's cheap price for five bucks for a big ole burrito they definitely need to raise their prices"}
{"text":"I've never tried any of the other locations, and this is my 2nd time at the Gilbert spot in two weeks. Signed up for the app my first visit and was given three stamps for two burritos. The bacon and egg and chorizo and egg burrito were good. 

Today we ordered four burritos and the guy only gives me one stamp. The app says buy nine burritos, get the 10th free. So I question him, \"I bought four burritos, don't I get four stamps?\" He says \"no, one per order.\" Now let me get this straight.  You can order a $5 burrito=one stamp or $25 worth of burritos=one stamp. Seems like a rip off! While waiting for my food, I see this same guy who handles the cash register, in the back preparing food without gloves. Then I see him movin a huge bucket then return to preparing food. 

I won't be returning to this location. Dishonest advertising and most important, not a very sanitary place to eat. Looks like this place needs a health inspection."}
{"text":"Kid at the front counter on Sunday, August 27th must really hate his job. I was treated very poorly. I even initiated the thank you and got nothing in return. This isn't the first time I have been treated like this by him. However, I will comment every time it happens. If it wasn't for my girlfriend wanting a chorizo burrito from her on Sundays, I would not give this establishment a dime."}
{"text":"Just moved to the west side about a week ago and ive already been twice! This is the best breakfast burrito ive ever had bar none. Its got a super chill atmosphere and great pricing! If your looking for high quality breakfast burritos look no further!"}
{"text":"Man. This place used to be bomb.... WHAT HAPPENED!? I called to place my order ahead of time like I typically do. Got places on hold and then they hung up. When I called back the man on the other line sounded like he needed a nap. I placed my order and he said it would take 20 mins..... I was already on my way and when I arrived I had one person in front of me, everyone seemed to be helped so when I asked if it would still be 20 mins he said yes, now... why name it express if it takes 20 mins!? . Don't call ahead I guess, cause going in and ordering will get you a burrito faster. Sorry I don't have 20 mins to wait for fast food ?"}
{"text":"This is our favorite \"lunch date\" place!  My husband and I love to stop in and indulge in their food whenever we are in the area.  The choices are just as good as sit down Mexican, and far better than the average take out place.  (The only thing missing is the wheelchair back to the car after such indulgence!)  It is extremely affordable too!  This particular location is in a nice area, very clean, and the employees are polite!  We have also been to the location on Alma School further north, but much rather prefer this one."}
{"text":"Dude, I fucks with this place Brandon is the shit. Like I live by the one in Mesa and I come to this one because these dudes know their way around a burrito. I'd trade my car for a half a burrito made here. I'd use my own sister as trade for a cup of the salsa. If I had to go to rehab it'd be for my addiction to this place. I'd straight up free base one of the tacos if I could. I recommend ordering 5 anything's from the menu, just take it all home and sit in the middle of all the things u ordered, feel that? That's as surrounded by love as you could ever feel. Five stars two moons and 1 solar system is how I rate this paradise."}
{"text":"Food was good, price is fine. Service was ok and they prepped the food quickly. It was good, just nothing special about it"}
{"text":"Wow! Awesome prices! Awesome food! The owner and family are super friendly and all so nice. Very clean environment to dine in. Very casual attire.
They got some real spicy stuff on their menu for the fans. 
I got a burrito supreme enchilada style.... Wow! Loved it! It was much bigger than I was expecting for the price. You definitely get what you paid for and more here. They do close early, around 3 pm on weekdays. So get an extra item and save it for dinner! Very fresh ingredients, made at time when ordered, and delicious! Sweet! You guys have a loyal fan here! They do support our local community as well. I recommend this place to anyone who loves mexican food!"}
{"text":"Good, solid burritos At a fair price. What else can a gringo ask for??? Great customer service."}
{"text":"Saw on the news the insulting message this company accidentally put on a customers receipt, but it was the astonishing response that will deter me from ever eating here. Id rather support a business who appreciates their customers, not disrespects them."}
{"text":"OK Thier chorizo and egg was dry and way over cooked. I love green chili burritos and grew up in El Paso TX on the border they are very very popular,at burrito express they are down right replusive. The \"gravy\" is so watery that it just spooges out at the first bite plus the meat is tough and has absolutely no green chili flavor.

I really wanted to love the place but Nope. I am almost thinking I should pop in and show them how to cook real Mexican food. (Or for that matter teach them how to make central TX breakfast burritos that are wildly popular.) 
Having grown up cooking and eating Mexican food I was so so disappointed.
(I gave it 3 visits before writing this review, if they want authentic recipes I will be happy to show them)"}
{"text":"First time here and ordered take out. Food was good but shredded beef was a little dry for my husband. Burrito was fantastic so I would probably stick with those. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"This place for me is dangerous!! I love ordering from here and since it requires$15 for a phone order, I get breakfast, lunch, dinner. The food is fantastic, the meat cooked beautifully. I finally went in once they have enough seating for a small crowd. It looks like a neighborhood kind of place which I love. Friendly, fast service. They are on my very short list for places to order at work. Thanks for the deliciousness."}
{"text":"Went in to get some basic Mexican food expecting what you would get at every other small Mex joint. Got an amazing surpise. Fresh ingredients and cooked and prepared perfect. Good job guys. I'm hooked."}
{"text":"Went to get a burrito here and was so disappointed.  First if you order a green chili burrito it should have more than 3 pieces of meat in it and flavor would be nice... Next are the beans....my gosh they scream canned beans!!!  Flavorless and disgusting.  

Overpriced and disgusting food to boot.  Come on!!!  I expected more but got way less..."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been going here for 3 years now and I've never had any issues. The cheese crisps are never greasy and the horchatas are quite tasty. I appreciate it that they let me put ice in the cup so it's never too much ice as well. The speed of my order is ridiculously fast too. I would recommend to a friend for low cost Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Burrito Express is one of those hole-in-the-wall places that, once you go once, you'll never stop.

My boyfriend and I got a hankering for mexican food one evening, but were way too lazy to actually change out of our pajamas and drive somewhere, so we searched the internet for a good place nearby that delivered, and thus we began our love affair with Burrito Express.

My boyfriend got the shredded beef burrito and i got the steak, potato & cheese burrito. Our food arrived in a decent amount of time, and oh sweet jesus was it delicious. The burritos were ginormous, and sooo tasty. My boyfriend couldn't even finish his entire burrito but I, completely lovestruck, buckled down and devoured mine competely like a starving lion or a panda that hasn't eaten for a while or some other equivalent nature reference. I was in heaven. And later that night I was in a food coma.

All subsequent trips to Burrito Express have been positive; the decor in the place is pretty sparse, but you'll barely notice it once your food arrives, and really, if you're complaining about how the place is decorated you're doing something wrong. The drinks are big and the aroma floating through the building (and out into the parking lot) are intoxicating, not to mention a visit will probably only cost you around $4.50 for a burrito and a couple bucks for a large drink.

My only complaint was that recently I went in around 5:30 for another one of my beloved steak-potato-cheese joy tubes (still talking about burritos here, don't get too excited) and instead of steak pieces, i got what was likely their machaca beef. It was pretty salty and made the cheese seem a little overpowering as a result, but I wasn't too upset by it and it was during the after-work dinner rush so they were probably either out of steak chunks or it was purely accidental and the machaca was likely nearing the end of the batch and had soaked up too much seasoning. I'm not going to let one less than awesome experience ruin my whole view of the place, so I'll let that one slide. Plus, I've worked at restaurants before and I know that there will always be an inevitable mistake here and there. 

Overall, great food, great prices, and a location that smells so heavenly i want to make a soap out of the smell and bathe in it daily? I'll happily journey down the street to this treasure of a burrito joint whenever i feel like getting my food on."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times (see my tip, burritos were good ) but after seeing the customer service issues on the news you better believe I won't be back.   If you forgot my food I'd  probably call and be mad too.  If that's the way you treat your customers,  I'll pass.   The place is pretty much a s*** hole inside too."}
{"text":"I've tried a few different things but hands down my favorite is the breakfast burrito supreme with green sauce! Every time I go in or order over the phone everyone is always so nice :)"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner and I am so glad that we did the supreme breakfast burrito was probably one of the best breakfast burritos I have ever had in Arizona I will definitely be returning to try the big burrito challenge.

I have to say the only downer about this place is that it really needs some hot hot sauce but other than that everything was great . Customer service was spot on."}
{"text":"While the service was quick, I would say that their food is probably a small step up from Filiberto's. My favorite thing was the shredded beef tacos, but the steak, potato, and cheese burrito left a lot to be desired. Overall, the adorable prices to the scale on this  restaurant. I would say it's right along with what you can expect from a fast food Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, the sickness I feel in my stomach is compelling me to post. And I never post ever. This place is objectively the worst Mexican takeout in the Gilbert-Chandler area. I'm sorry, but at least you know what your getting at Taco Bell and Del Taco. I got the Burrito Supremo (with very bad chicken and much for beans) and the Steak something. The steak was tasteless and luck warm. And a weird tinge of grey. Like it had been kept warm for a week in water grey. Don't go here."}
{"text":"I LOVE BURRITO EXPRESS. My fiance has been going with his friends since they were in high school and he finally took me to try the only thing his group ever orders: a steak, potato and cheese burrito. EPIC. This burrito was so awesome that they have never tried anything else on the menu and I feel the exact same way. The tortilla is huge and fresh and the burrito itself is gigantic. I can never finish mine but the boys seem to eat it right up! Don't leave this place without trying the horchata either, it's so good. I've been to other Mexican places like this and the horchata tasted like gross water. Burrito Express however does it right and I will always go back to this place whenever I'm up for the BEST BURRITO EVER."}
{"text":"Im used to spicy food but my wife isn't. I know Mexican food tends to be spicy but on the menu they had red peppers  specifying spicy stuff so we decided to order the Burrito Supreme with chicken which it didn't had the pepper so she said \"nice not spicy\". First bite she took the chicken was so spicy even I couldn't eat it of how spicy it was. We ordered over the phone after checking their website, Instagram and their app. I clearly said I had never ordered before from this place. Service was good that's why I'm giving 3 stars. So frustrated to throw away the whole Burrito 5 dollars just because they never said \"Hey our chicken is spicy! Are you okay with this?\" Just my two cents...  besides this great food!"}
{"text":"This is a \"cash only\" business. The quality and amount of food is good for the price. Don't expect anything fancy. This place is as simple as it gets."}
{"text":"Ok I am from So-Cal by the beach where breakfast burritos are king. These dudes make a mean breakfast burrito for a damn good price. I am gonna say one of the best I ever had. Get the Breakfast supreme burrito(BSB) with the verde salsa. I will be back because I finally found that home style beach breakfast burrito here in the valley. They killed it and now will have a loyal customer. Next time I am going to chimichanga that burrito and see how it goes. Super bomb and amazing price. That's what I am talking about. Check em out get a breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"This place is kind of attached to circle k. You order at an outdoor counter. It is more of a togo venue. It's nice to order a burrito, go inside circle k for a cheaper drink, then take it all home! 

This is a standard taco shop type place. I have always had good food here!"}
{"text":"Burrito Express may not be the classiest establishment, but their burritos are to die for. It's definitely worth the trip when you're looking for a quick, delicious and very filling meal. I like to dine in because I honestly believe it tastes the best right when it's made and still piping hot. A Mexican food place that delivers though? Awesome.

The supreme breakfast burrito (bacon, ham, potato and cheese) is always fresh and hot. I could eat this anytime of the day. The steak, potato and cheese burrito is another favorite. The steak doesn't taste old or chewy like other fast food steak burritos. If it's a little dry, add sour cream! Specialty burritos like this are only $4.35 which I think is a steal. The burritos are so big that my boyfriend and I share one burrito and get a side of chips and salsa. They give you red and green salsa with warm chips. They're a little salty but I just use more salsa.

They also have some good day time specials like free chips and salsa when you dine in or .99 cent tacos on certain days of the week. I will continue to make the drive from Scottsdale to Mesa whenever I'm having a burrito craving because Los Betos and Super Burrito cannot even compare!"}
{"text":"Seriously so good every single time. The flavors are so authentic and delicious. I had usually gotten lunch here, but I tried a breakfasts burrito and I'm a little obsessed. The portion sizes are huge as well.  The service is fast and friendly. I'm usually pretty scared of hole in the wall type places, but it is clean and has great service. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"They have those great smokey tortillas.  Bean and cheese burrito, chorizo and egg and lots of green and red sauce are delicious."}
{"text":"if i could give this place zero stars i would!!!!!  ordered food 1 hr ago and still waiting for our food hour 1/2 later when i did call the location a women answered the phone and i explained the senerio that we have been waiting hour 1/2 for 3 burritos and 2 tacos that we ordered and her response was were only 20 mins late do you want your food or not!!!! i was throw back by the whole conversation so i asked to speak to a manager and said are you seriously coping an attitude with me! she said i'm the owner.....are you kidding me this is how an owner treats customers!!!!!  i'm cant believe how rude she was she told my co worker that she is refusing service to us because we called asking where our food was this lady is absolutely crazy and i would never ever order food from this place again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It truly pains me to write this review and change my rating from 5 to 1 stars. We were loyal burrito express customers for 20 years frequenting the place weekly. 

2017 has not been a good year for this once great burrito joint.

The service is now consistently abysmal. The last half dozen trips here have been miserable experiences. They have been rude, incredibly slow, and simply don't appear to care about the quality of food, cleanliness, or service. 

It sad to see an old mesa staple like B.E become just another crappy burrito place that should be passed over."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best, the customer service is pretty lousy. The angry kid in the front is not happy whatsoever with this job."}
{"text":"I always feel like there is something missing in my life and I am not sure if it is a person, puppy, or burrito. Thank goodness I found Burrito Express around the corner from my office. I don't know how you don't put on ten pounds without cutting out Mexican food because these burritos will be the death of my waistline. I guess that's the difference between want and need. Like, I want abs but I need a burrito. In the end like the saying goes, the more you weigh, the harder you are to kidnap. These burritos are generously sized and priced so affordably with tons of amazing choices for the breakfast burrito. It has become a staple of our office morning routine. I am a huge fan of their machaca and/or breakfast supreme (bacon and eggs) burritos. Slather the green sauce and your morning coffee just found it's perfect partner in crime. The only downside I've experienced is starting my work day at 6:30a and they aren't open until 8:00a to feed my hunger strike. They should open earlier; I love sleep because is like a time machine to breakfast."}
{"text":"Always fresh, fat, and delicious. Never stingy with the sauce either. Good dudes, good burritos."}
{"text":"We came in not long before closing because my husband was starving and we'd not tried this place before. I asked the employee on duty what the best item on the menu was. Without hesitation, he said \"steak, potato and cheese\". I'll be honest, it's not something I normally order but he seemed sure, so I went with it. And...it really was good with a surprising amount of flavor. I don't remember what my husband ordered but it was just \"okay\".  I liked the green sauce, he liked the red. 

So...4 stars for my burrito and 3 stars for whatever he ordered (pix in post$"}
{"text":"Just found this new McCormick Ranch jewel.  Great breakfast burritos.  Authentic tortillas and taste and under $5 each you can't beat the price.  Restaurant staff is fast and friendly and the facility is clean. We will be back for more and this is now on our family favorites list."}
{"text":"This is my wife's favorite place to eat. Good service and deliver as we'll keep ordering even my kids love it."}
{"text":"Picked up a large order today, and we waited for several minutes while they 2 guys behind the counter chatted with each other.  And, when we got home, 2 of our orders were incorrect.  I hope they fix their service inconsistencies because the food is great!"}
{"text":"Alright Tempe-dwelling college students, listen up! Mexican delivery! I was friggin' fascinated when I realized that I could sit on my rump and order delicious machaca and chips and salsa. Now, I'll be the first to admit that if you're willing to travel a little bit there are a bunch of great Mexican joints in the area, but c'mon now...delivery is sweet! There isn't too much to say about this place so I'll keep things short. If you're craving greasy, salty and filling Mexican munchies, and you're a bit too lit to drive, gives this place a try."}
{"text":"The food was not bad but the restaurant was just weird.  The employees were two pimply faced teenagers.  The food is on a counter staying heated in silver containers and then they put together what you order.  My kids got nachos.  It was chips with fake cheese sauce.  I ordered a bean and cheese burrito, it was just okay.  The guacamole was in a plastic store bought container.  

I won't go back."}
{"text":"The burritos from burrito express are always good. I never had a problem with this particular location until my last visit on 10/13/16. Aside from the great customer service, I found plastic in my food. I'm not sure where the plastic came from but it was mixed in with my nachos. The plastic was light blue and definitely noticeable. I haven't returned to burrito express since then but I hope they read my comment and possibly correct the plastic issue. Again, customer service was amazing but the plastic grossed me out."}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time. It was delicious. I had a steak and potato burrito. Don't get the chicken unless you love heartburn. It's crazy spicy as advertised. This is good cheap Mexican food. The service was very good."}
{"text":"Good burrito, Marshall recommended a flavorful authentic breakfast burrito. I while watching some sport center. Couldn't have been better, when you go in ask for Marshall and tip the man they work hard over there!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican Delivery Food!

In a town where delivery food is dominated by pizza and pseudo-chinese, it was nice to find a Mexican restaurant that would deliver to my house.  

I ordered a \"Taco Order\" (3 tacos) and a Chorizo and Potato Burrito.  The tacos were good.  The tortillas were NOT the usual pre-folded Taco Bell things.  They were made just as I like them...crispy on the outside and still soft on the inside.  The meat was a little salty, but still very good.  The lettuce was still crisp when it got to my house.  I guess that's a tribute to my delivery driver.

The Burrito was very good.  Filled with Chorizo and Potato goodness.  Once again, the tortilla was exceptional.  

While they told me to expect a 45 minute delivery time, the food arrived in 30.  In all, I've got no complaints."}
{"text":"I would have given this 4 stars as the burrito I had was pretty good. I am giving 2 stars though because I could see the girl in the back making the burritos etc. and she was not wearing any gloves. She was handling the food with her bare hands and then frequently touching her hair as it kept falling in her face and out of the hair tie she used to pull it back into a ponytail; she also kept touching her clothing, face, etc. So I was kind of grossed out by that, not knowing if she had washed her hands or what she had been touching besides her hair while she was preparing food ya know. I thought it was a state law that people had to wear plastic gloves while touching food. Also would have been nice if her hair would have been tied back more securely and not falling in her face and over the food all the time. Maybe wear a hairnet? I probably won't go back again because of this."}
{"text":"One of best quick burritos you can get in the valley. My favorite is the shredded beef and cheese with a side of chips. The salsa is also really good. They have a good kids menu also. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Just called to make a take out order.  When I first called I let Sean know that it would be 3 separate orders for one pickup and immediately he let out a huge sigh/grunt, didn't even try to hide his annoyance.  As I continued to make my order he was short and extremely rude.  I didn't get his name the first time I called so I called back to verify who I had been speaking with.  I will be calling to make a complaint to the manager about him it was extremely unprofessional from start to finish.  When I had called back he hung up on me before I had finished my sentence.

This is our first experience with Burritos express, was looking forward to trying it.  I would have canceled the order but my coworker was already on her way to go get it.  I will update on the food experience once food arrives and I can try but so far I'm unimpressed.

Between the 3 of us eating from this place it was mixed reviews.  My meal was amazing but I wont be returning to this location, I would def eat at another location.  The 2nd of us ordered shredded beef nachos, they left out the sour cream and left out the cheese.  The 3rd one of us ordered hard tacos and was def not impressed.  Burritos seems to be the way to go."}
{"text":"Delicious  burritos and cheese crisps for the kids. Portions are very good. I had the shredded meat burrito with an egg. Very tasty!  I think food is very tasty and will be back.  The do need to get more staff to cover lunch rush and to keep the place clean. Good luck Express!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible customer service. The girl who took our order (shoulder length blonde hair, black framed glasses) was cold and rude and seemed incredibly annoyed that we had not been there before and needed to look at the menu. Scowl on her face and short pissed off voice as she asked 'is that all'. She slammed our cups down on the counter instead of handing them to me and walked away. Another customer went up and asked for more salsa for his to go order and she rudely snapped back \"I already gave you salsa\" the gentleman said back 'I have eight burritos here I would like a couple more things of salsa please' she huffed and tossed him the salsa. He said thank you repeatedly and she ignored him. 
After that she was too busy bad mouthing that previous customer loudly so that everyone in there could hear, that she forgot to give the kitchen the next guys order. 
He asked about his order after waiting a long time and she asked him if he ordered online!!! She took his order, he stood in front of her 15 minutes prior and gave her his order and she didn't remember because she was too busy talking crap about customers to her co-workers!
Every single customer who came in had the same rude and snarky treatment from her. The atmosphere in there was so tense and awkward and we were all looking at each other like 'is this lady serious?!' There were two kitchen men joining in on the badmouthing of customers and rude looks to customers when bringing out their food. We will not be back. 
Breakfast burritos were okay not much flavor but cold from sitting in the back until the lady behind the counter noticed we still didn't have our order after 30 minutes."}
{"text":"This place has the BOMB breakfast burritos! Waaay better than Taco Shack or any of the other local spots."}
{"text":"Yuk!! Where do I start...the place looks dirty..customer service Rude at the counter...breakfast burrito with bacon.. Hardly no bacon... Bathrooms worse than a gas station disgusting with no soap...I hope the owners read this and make some radical changes..I will not return to this location until the above is addressed."}
{"text":"I eat here a couple times a month.  Their steak potato and cheese burrito is my favorite.  I've also had the green chile burrito that is really good.  Always fast service and it's all for a good price.  This place is defiantly worth trying out."}
{"text":"I love the breakfast burrito supreme!! A nice alternate from my stand by of Los Favoritos. Unfortunately the rolled tacos aren't any good and now I'm afraid to try anything else. The place needs an update and could be cleaner but it's consistently good! The owner is a great guy too! Will be back."}
{"text":"Went there once a few months back, saw not one but two large roaches on the floor. That was enough for me to cancel my order and never return."}
{"text":"Ehhh.........
Had a BOGO coupon, lets give them a try.

First Im a vegetarian, and when I said that at the counter. They looked at me like I had 2 heads.  No suggestions, not \"We have this, or we can do this....\"

Just........a..........blank............stare............

Ok, I'll have 2 of the triple something.......beans and red and green sauce.
It was like a water balloon. One wrong bite and this thing was going to explode. The combination did not mix well. I threw the free one away.......no bien. 
This place is utterly forgettable."}
{"text":"Very,very rude. Nobody in restaurant. We walk in, up to the counter. 4 people talking behind counter. As I politely asked if we could order, one baldy holds up his finger. Oh boy. We had to leave."}
{"text":"This place didn't \"do it for me\"

The burrito was not that big.
The potatoes were not peeled showing a lack of care put in to prep.
The red hot sauce is more tomatoey than what I typicality like and the green had a flavor that was not my favorite. At 4.99 for a potato and egg burrito sans cheese I likely will not be rushing back with other good options in the area."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area, and left my favorite breakfast burrito a 30 minute drive away. Naturally, I am searching for a replacement and this place is 2 minutes from my house so I tried it first. SO GOOD!! I've eaten here twice now - and I only discovered it a week ago! Steak and eggs is surely solid! It isn't comparable to my previous favorite burrito just because it's so different - but I will take this one any day. The greens salsa is amazing!"}
{"text":"Let's say McDonald's is a better option bad food even worse service I tried them about 6 years ago it was bad fast forward to today still bad the only authentic was the grease"}
{"text":"Nasty, nasty, nasty! We got delivery awhile back and not only did it take forever but the food was horrid. The enchilada sauce was super thin with NO flavor at all. Don't get me started on the beans with way too much salt and chunky pieces. Stay away- you have been warned!"}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos are not good at all. The ingredients are not quality, and you can get much better for your Money at a place like filibertos. The tortillas are paper thin and have zero flavor. It just really isn't good Mexican food. There's so many other good Mexican places to eat in the valley, don't choose this one."}
{"text":"¡Su burrito de desayuno es muy bueno! 

I've been to Burrito Express a couple times, and on each occasion, I was drawn to have breakfast for dinner. The first time, I tried the regular ham and egg burrito. It's big with healthy amounts of egg, ham, and cheese throughout. The dish is served with a side of lettuce and the servers will bring out bottles of red and green sauce to top it all off. In the mood for even more? Step up your breakfast burrito game and get one with steak and eggs. It's what you'd expect and loaded with potatoes to boot. This one had me full and satisfied. My wife enjoys their bean and cheese burrito.

The inside of the establishment is deceivingly spacious for the location. You can choose to hunker down at a table or booth, all within viewing distance of the big TV on the wall. I noticed that each time I went the TV channel was playing an international or uncommon American sport like women's boxing or volleyball. The outside of the restaurant even promotes English Premier League soccer, so that's pretty cool too.

So, hey, whenever you're in the mood for some conveniently priced, quick and tasty Mexican food, give Burrito Express a try.

¡Adios amigos!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burrito if you don't want to spend alot. I like the place. However I sat on hold for 15 minutes while I drove to their location. I got there and showed the guy my phone (still on hold). He doesn't even apologize! He tells me how busy he is and that he was trying to get to it. He literally took 6 orders while is sat on the phone. I could hear because they don't have any call waiting line. Ridiculous. Don't expect too much by way of customer service here."}
{"text":"Not bad! I think the trick here is familiarizing yourself with the menu, and knowing how to finagle orders to your liking. 

My husband loves getting their steak, potato, and cheese burrito while today I tried the green chili. His burrito ended up being a bit salty, but much more hearty than mine. The green chili burrito is mostly sauce with chunks of beef which honestly, didn't have as much flavor as I'd like (It's also not one I'd eat while driving since sauce spills out everywhere.) Luckily, there are red or green salsas you can ask for. Green is pretty flavorful, mild, where as the red (my favorite) had a much better spice level. 

Wait wasn't bad, and prices are reasonable, especially for a burrito joint attached to a gas station. Our two huge burritos together cost like $10, and salsas are complementary. 

If I get it again, I'll either get something with eggs or potatoes, or at least add them if they're not already included to make it more filling. I'll also make sure to stock up on the red sauce. 

Overall, if it weren't for the salsa, my burrito would be kinda sad... But since my husband loves his steak one and it's so cheap, I'll probably end up ordering here again."}
{"text":"Welcome to my side of town! Best Breakfast Burrito in town made better at being able to get one any time during the day. Not to say the other food is bad but sometimes you succumb to the cravings. This, so much so, we would drive down to Alma School at 8:PM on as weekday just to get one. (Or several, depending if it was dinner time.) 

New owners are nice, not as Ghetto as the other place. (Is this a franchise?) Kid friendly, good food - reasonable prices and close by my house - win win go on in!"}
{"text":"Good burritos.  Next time I am gonna try a breakfast burrito.  They claim to have the best.  The side of rice I had wasn't good.  They may want to come up with a different recipe.  Beans were good.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Called in to order burritos for delivery after receiving a flyer - they would not honor the flier pricing - manager was rude and would not give out the info of her boss to file a complaint.  Worst customer we service ever - bare & switch marketing"}
{"text":"This is a great little burrito place. I always order either the breakfast supreme or the steak, potato and cheese burrito.  I saw some negative reviews, but honesty, if you know what to order, you will be happy.  I have converts dozens of people and all have become hooked.  I never come out of this place feeling like crap like a lot of other Mexican fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm from NY so I love finding little hole in the walls..ya this place looks sketchy but I wish there was more like this! I'm all for hot stuff I got the spicy machaca burro..and mann! It was spicy! Will def be back to try some more..I couldn't finish this nice sized burro due to the hotness but can't wait to try something else! Good size good price good food!"}
{"text":"Walked in, nobody at the counter. Waited 10 minutes. Still nobody. The floor was filthy and I could see the kitchen was not much cleaner. I walked two doors down to Kebabs & Gyros and received a much warmer welcome and a clean place to eat. You can do better."}
{"text":"This is a great quick and easy burrito place. It's attached to the circle K gas station and makes it convenient to grab a snack if you're in a rush. 

Food is always good for a quick little joint like this. Not overly greasy or anything. The horchata is delicious and one of my favs! Everything we've had there has been good. 

They also have corn tortillas and can make things relatively gluten free, if you aren't concerned about contamination or trace ingredients. 

The cash only is a bit annoying, but hey its right next to a gas station which has an ATM inside..sooo not too bad. 

Give this place a try if you're in the mood for some quick mexican food"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with burrito express!! It's cheap and so good if you get the right thing. I always used to get the burrito supreme until I was introduced to the supreme breakfast burrito. BEST breakfast burrito I've EVER HAD! There's so much flavor and good-ness in it, it's amazing. I love to pair it with their green salsa. 

As for the customer service, I've never had any problems. They're always super nice and always smiling at me. The food comes out in a timely manner, but I would suggest calling the order in ahead though especially during breakfast or lunch. 

My family loves picking this up for dinner every so often because it's cheap and there is something for everyone! I will always come back to Burrito Express."}
{"text":"It's been about 2 1/2 years since my last review and probably another 40 or 50 visits!  They are VERY consistent and always great tasting meals.
I have never found better green chili burritos, or their rice and their beans, which have a deep and wonderful flavor.  The prices are a bargain, as they use lots of fresh ingredients and you can taste the \"home cooking\".  This place will always be my \"go to\" Mexican restaurant, especially for take-out.  They have added 2 more locations making 6!  A new little empire developing before your eyes.  Try them, I'm sure you will become a food fan."}
{"text":"This location has very unprofessional service. I started going to burrito express about 20 years ago. This one is right by my work. The manager has twice put me on hold and forgot about me when I called in for a take out order. No apology offered when we call back. 

Today my husband was there and had just sat down after ordering when I arrived to get my take out order. I wasn't going to say anything about being on hold until I saw him do it to someone else while I was there. My husband and I were the only people in there and he put the cordless phone down and walked away. 

I mentioned to another staff member that when I called I have been left on hold with the phone down so I could hear everything going on and knew that they weren't helping anyone else but they had just forgotten to come back to the phone. This worker apologized and said he just arrived to work and was not aware. The manager rolled his eyes and made a face. I asked him if there was a problem. He began to shout at me that he had already heard on the phone that he had put me on hold and I didn't need to say it again and I was being very rude and his restaurant in front of his customers. Again the only person that was in the restaurant besides me was my husband but he did not know he was my husband. He continued to YELL at me and told me that if I have a problem with the way they run their business to go somewhere else. 

I told him forget the order for my office I would like my money back. He shouted at me and at this point my husband steps in to say why are you yelling at her and settle down.  He tells my husband to shut the fuck up and sit down. Now my husband is upset, but neither or us are heated. We both explain we just want both of our orders refunded now because we will not give him our business or money. He tells my husband he isn't getting his fucking money back. Then he says come at me bro. It's all really a blur now hours later but a lot of cursing and shouting by the manager. I asked for the phone number of the owner Angel. He pretends not to hear me. I asked again. Still nothing. My husband decides to step out so he doesn't get more provoked by this guy and do something dumb. 

The manager throws my money back me and tells me to leave the premises because I'm trespassing. Insane. I got to the car and was completely rattled by this encounter over nothing. 

My husband called the owner's son Angel who said he would leave me a $30 gift card at the restaurant. I WILL NEVER RETURN. I don't want the gift card. 

I called and spoke with the owner's daughter Jackie who told me the manager has been fired before and brought back by Angel. Said she has had many complaints about him but since Angel runs that location it's out of her hands. She did say she would let the owner (her father know). I told her I wasn't going to write a bad review because I've known the family since I was 7 years old, but she told me I should and apologized sincerely. 

It's unfortunate that what could be a great place for lunch has now ruined my feelings towards a restaurant I have enjoyed for 20 years. I should mention this location is fairly new. How can you keep an employee who is so awful? Is it worth it? I know I'm just one customer, but from the sounds of it he is a known problem.

(Edited to add I had tried to record this entire encounter on my phone because it was nuts. It wasn't recording because I guess I didn't hit the button when I thought. When I did actually get it recording he finally decided to give me back my money. Then he tells me that it's illegal to record him and that he has my name and credit card information. I said I paid cash and he said he has it saved from past purchases. Seems like he was trying to threaten me?)"}
{"text":"guy on the phone was extremely nice but they screwed up our order and this isn't the first time..."}
{"text":"I have had these guys swing by and drop off some burros on a couple of occasions and I was more than impressed!

Hot fresh tortilla wrapped goodness. Most recently I had them bring a carne asada burro and a bacon, egg, 'tater burro for the next day. They have a $15 minimum order for delivery (which I totally understand and think is fair) so ordering a couple things is needed...which is great cuz everything is delicious.  

Somehow when I started grubbing it was still steaming hot and fresh. BOMB flavors, salsa was good'n'spicy and I didn't have to leave the house?!?! yes please and thank you!"}
{"text":"I had the food once. My boyfriend brought it over. I thought it was pretty awful. Anything ending in \"berto's\" beats the hell out of this crap. As a matter of fact, ANY Mexican food including Taco Bell, Del Taco, etc... is 10 times better than this food.

I proooooobably wouldn't have worried about doing a review but I happened to see this story:

http://www.eater.com/2015/5/8/8575881/arizona-restaurant-insults-woman-on-receipt

Uhhhh...wow. Seriously? You should appreciate that this Mia woman actually pays money for your nasty slop. But I guess being a jerk to a customer is about right if you want to keep the customer service on par with the flavor."}
{"text":"Burrito Express...how do I describe you? You're like a dive bar...that only serves Mexican food and no alcohol. You're not in the greatest part of town. You're located in a less than reputable shopping center. Your parking lot is treacherous (only one way in and out with minimal parking). But I'm not here to review your atmosphere. I'm here to review your awesome burrito! 

I stopped in one afternoon to grab something quick. I didn't expect that when I ordered my food that it would be THAT quick, however. From the time I made my choice to the time I sat down, I don't think five minutes elapsed. When my Chicken, Potato & Cheese burrito came out, it was piping hot! 

My particular burrito was on the spicy side...which is how I like it. Now, I know that the menu had the little \"hey, idiot...this is spicy\" symbol next to this burrito. However, I was caught a little off guard at how spicy it actually was. To put it mildly, it's been quite some time since I ate something spicy enough to give me the sniffles.The burrito was quite sizable, too. For comparative purposes, I'd say it falls right between a Chipotle burrito and one from Q'Doba. It was definitely very filling. Couple the size of the burrito with the massive amounts of shredded chicken and potatoes inside, and I was full for quite some time afterwards.

Price wise, I think I ended up spending around $8.00 for the burrito and a \"medium\" drink that would make a camel think twice before drinking it. Couple that with the awesome red and green salsas they keep in the refrigerator, and you're set!

If you're looking for quick Mexican food for a decent price (and  you're not overly-concerned with ambiance or location), then stop by Burrito Express. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner (combination plates), so you can come any time of day. If you don't want to stop by, they deliver, too!"}
{"text":"The people that work here and their customer service SUCK! These people should not be working with customers. On several occasions I have walked up to the counter and all THREE of the workers just kind of stare or avoid eye contact.. so bizarre. One of the younger dudes always talks to my baby without acknowledging me and will try and touch her. Today when I went, he told me how kids get worse as they get older and after I told him I disagreed, he said \"no kids suck when they get older\" Umm rude? There is also another guy (probably about 30, with a backwards hat and a pen behind his ear) who I have watched be extremely rude and impatient with an old man while he ordered. He called out his order when it was done and watched the old man slowly get up and got tired of waiting for him (when he could have taken it to him) and he just dropped it on the counter and walked away. Another time, my mom spilled her drink and she went and told the gal about it and the girl handed her some towels.. when my mom told her it would need to be mopped she rolled her eyes and walked to the back and we never saw her again.. these people are TERRIBLE! I will not be eating here anymore which makes me sad because the food is good. I will tell all my friends to avoid this place."}
{"text":"I made an order for delivery and was told it would be about 45 minutes to an hour. After an hour I called to make sure my order wasn't lost or something, I've worked in food, I know things sometimes happen, and was told the delivery is on it's way and will arrive in a few minutes (I live just two miles away). Forty minutes after that phone call, I call them back and am put on hold for 10+ minutes, and my food finally arrives while I am waiting to speak to someone. The delivery man did not apologize for the wait, and I had to run around my house looking for a pen because he did not have one. After all this my order was not even correct as I ordered it. I will never again order from this place."}
{"text":"Don't ever go here! There customer service is the WORSE. I spend over $25 for lunch for my family and it was all messed up, wasn't cooked all the way through and the tortilla was stuck to the wrapper, and ripped the whole burrito! Then when I called he talked to me for 5 mins then asked to \"put me on hold cause he had other things that were more important\" so I said ok, and he had me on hold for as long as possible until he took it off and once he realized I was holding, he hung up. Super messed up! -this was my first time coming, and will NEVER come again."}
{"text":"Fresh and convenient!  I had the machaca breakfast burrito with rice and beans.  It was very flavorful.  Fast and friendly service and clean."}
{"text":"I work 2 miles from this restaurant, it's unfortunate, after  reading the reviews I am scared to do try express bueiro , too bad  I love  breakfast burritos, after reading how the manager treats people, and the long wait time,"}
{"text":"Just heard about burrito express a couple of days ago, and I live in the outlying area.  I have to say I ordered the burrito supreme and it was fantastic.  The tortillas were excellent and the burrito had a great flavor profile.  Will definitely go back and recommend to anyone looking for good Mexican food.  Thanks Greg you have my business."}
{"text":"**Terrible Customer Service** The lady running this location is rude and has a smart mouth.  She treats her employees equally bad.
I won't ever be back to this location."}
{"text":"I tried the burrito express location on higley and val vista located right next to the circle k.  This location doesn't have a yelp so I'm warning people here, I had a terrible experience and definantly won't be returning.  

I ordered a steak potato and cheese and while waiting I was swarmed by flies that seemed to be everywhere.  My burrito was pretty good, but the red sauce was terrible.  About halfway through I take a bite and chew something cold and crispy with a crunch to it that sounds almost like lettuce.  I look at my burrito dont see anything resembling lettuce, they must have used bad potatoes or not cooked everything through. 

Fast forward 4 hours later and I'm dealing with intense stomach pain, I had to go home from work early.  The Higley and Baseline location gave me food poisoning.  I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hole in the wall take out Mexican food restaurants! I have yet to go wrong with anything here!"}
{"text":"Usually love a good breakfast burrito but....ordered a bacon egg and cheese burrito that was 99% egg. Bacon and cheese was almost non existent. Maybe they were in too big of a hurry because it was very busy. Hope they see this and fix it because it is usually ok."}
{"text":"Very good burritos, they compete with burrito Shack breakfast burritos but so far theirs are better. Very tasty and good service, a little slow and had to get a refund for bacon in our burrito we didn't want. But other than that I recommend it."}
{"text":"First time here and I am coming back.  The food was amazing and the customer service was the best! Angel the owner was very friendly and obviously takes pride in what he does! A+"}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick meal. They can't seem to ever get my order right. The last 3 Times burritos were made wrong with and without things I not only ordered but paid for. CHECK OUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE!!! They do have the BEST green sauce!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, I had the steak burrito. My co-worker had the chicken burrito and didn't like it, but my steak burrito was fine. The restaurant was surprisingly clean, so were the restrooms, and it was nice that the staff spoke English fluently."}
{"text":"My husband and I keep trying to find \"the\" Mexican place.  This wasn't it.

It was just alright.  Not great.  Not bad.  Not worth it.

The place really needs a few coats of paint and some cleaning up.  I did not enjoy squeezing my salsa out of a dirty ketchup bottle either."}
{"text":"they hooked me up you guys i had no idea they even had more than one location, shout out to them for making my day!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience. The dashing young man with long hair working the register is absolutely amazing with customer service. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Have it in my weekly rotation. Favorite burritos are the steak, potato and cheese and the chicken salsa. BOMB.COM"}
{"text":"Great place 4 quick breakfast if call 1st.  Food is made fresh if you eat in be prepared to wait 5 or 10 minutes. I love the Supreme breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"The supreme breakfast burrito is the number one breakfast burro in chandler, a must try for all.  I am impressed with the meat portions in the taco/enchilada combos as well..the downers...they desperately need some spicy hot sauce.  I hope to see this place do well and stick around for a long time to come.  I would also like to see the owner be a little tougher on a few of his employees (dress code, on the phone while working, smoking out front, etc). Overall, great spot to fill the hunger void for less than $10.00..giant drinks as well."}
{"text":"My first time here today. They were totally empty but still, my order was made incorrectly. It was made into a burrito instead of a chimichanga. The tortilla wasn't fried or crispy at all. Just warm. Not a big deal, I called and asked nicely if they could refund just the upcharge since it costs more to make it a chimi. I had to sit on hold for five minutes and listen to the manager talk to the associate who answered the phone about how he didn't want to deal with it, how he didn't do anything wrong, how he wasn't going to talk to me himself, and that if I wanted a refund, I had to drive all the way back to the store over the $1.95. That whole conversation was way worse than making up the mishap. I can't believe someone like that is in charge! No wonder your store was dead on a weekend during lunch time. 
Also, the food tasted terrible. There are seven hundred Mexican restaurants in the area I'll go to before trying this place again."}
{"text":"Always great breakfast burritos!!! Have never had a bad meal here!!! Thank you for making mornings a little better!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 6 Green Chili Burritos (promotion); received what kind of resembled a green chill soup in a tortilla.  They must have had a stampede prior to making ours because the beef was scarce maybe 3-6 pieces in each.  Which makes the most expensive food I have ever purchased.  $24 for $2 of ingredients, should have made them myself..."}
{"text":"I walked into this place and with barely a grunt from a very rude guy just standing looking at me like I could read his mind.  No hello.. nothing!   I proceeded to ask for the ground beef and potato burrito (I had looked at the menu online) and with a slight grunt and no eye contact he said no ground beef. (this was always my favorite thing at other Burrito Exp locations)  I then looked at the menu again because I had eaten many times at the Burrito Express on Alma School and it was always excellent no matter what you had (Love the  fam that owned it ) I ordered and being the only person in the place thought well that will be fast...boy was I wrong.  10 minutes later the \"guy\" yelled out my order ..no thank you..nothing. I left unhappy with the service at this location but I also left sad that my once fav place had went down the drain so badly with such ignorant people working there.  I wish I could say the food made up for it but sorry to say it looked over cooked and tasted even worse."}
{"text":"I get cravings for red chili burritos. The burritos here are big and fill me up. It is a quick, easy and cheap breakfast. I am a lifetime fan!"}
{"text":"I order from here all the time when at work. Its always within the hour, or if they are running late, they make sure that you know just how much later. Food is always hot when it gets here, Great Prices, and always tastes bomb! Staff is super friendly every single time! LOVE LOVE LOVE!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out after driving by it everyday for the past year. Tried a bacon breakfast burrito. It was a little pricey compared to my usual Los Favoritos. The burrito was average. Very salty and had a weird aftertaste. It was not horrible but also not preferred. The lighting was a little weird too. Felt like I was at a disco. The fans are located right under a light. So the light would flash like a strobe light. I got my order to go, but eating there would have been a challenge of I stayed."}
{"text":"Great machaca burrito! Fresh ingredients, friendly staff, great prices! Yummmmmmmmmmmyyy!"}
{"text":"Super good burrito lunch place. No nonsense straight forward burritos. Was disappointed they had no chips to try the nachos and salsa. All burritos under $5 bucks!!"}
{"text":"Great burrito! You can definitely notice the ingredients are fresh and good quality. The staff is super friendly. My only con is that the spicy labeled burritos are not spicy, so it would be great to add an extra spicy salsa to the menu."}
{"text":"Chicken potato with cheese is the way to go! I'm very picky about my hot sauces. They have two to choose from, Both are delicious!"}
{"text":"So I actually tried Burrito Express on a Sat morning with my brother and my daughter, my daughter was buying (she has a job now and can afford to take her mom out haha) and told me I needed to try this place, so we did.

I had a breakfast burrito, it had ham and eggs but also threw in some chorizo into and ask the guy to hit it with some red chile sauce, and don't be shy, while it was cooking and he did! Man that was a kick butt breakfast burrito!! 

So that made me think um wonder how their lunch time burros are. So I went to check them out at lunch time and ordered me a steak and salsa burrito, it had steak, cheese, lettuce, and salsa! I made it combo so it came with beans and rice.

While I was paying the guy asked if I wanted hot sauce, and I said yea  both red and green, (sn: their green sacue is really good! Def do try it) and he said one of both, I said more like 2 of both ( really I wanted atleast 3 of both, I like my food packed with heat!) he said can you eat them all.....pls he does not know who he is talking to,,bring on the heat baby! I can handle it!

So I paid and was getting ready to walk out and go next door to Starbucks and he said do you want your food, I was like wow its ready? He said its not burrito slow, its burrito express, too funny.  I like people with personality!  And guess what!! This place delivers!!! How freakin cool is that!! 

I think I have found me a new little joint and ready to try the rest of the menu out!"}
{"text":"We have been getting burritos from Burrito Express every weekend for over a year. I love the place. Bacon, egg and cheese is our usual with their amazing green sauce. The red is also good but the green sauce really stands out. The customer service is awesome weather it's Noah or Serg and once they get to know you they treat you like family. I would also recommend the green chili breakfast burrito. The meat inside it is unbelievably tender. People have told us of other burrito places to try but we have no desire to go elsewhere. Call your order in beforehand if you want to just walk up, pay and get your food. It works great."}
{"text":"this place is on point. located at the late Oliveo Grill, I prefer this restaurant. Closing so early is a bit of a bummer but the food is great and there are some flat screens in there to watch tv on. pretty fucking good water cups, theyre like bean cups or something haha, weird assed dimensions but whatevs. i had the breakfast burrito supreme, shit was so best. will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"This is the THIRD time out of five times eating this and  getting a hair inside my burrito. The only reason I get burrito express is because my office orders it and I have no other option. The hair was wrapped around the bacon halfway through the burrito so I know it wasn't a possibility to be mine as were the last two. Do you guys not wear hair nets or pull the hair back? When we get this I look at every single bite I take because the past hairy experiences. I refuse to eat this again. I feel like throwing up I'm so mad I paid for this to not eat it again."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. We ordered a chorizo burrito and a supreme one. The food came out fast and we had no issues with service. The food however was extremely over salted and peppered, almost like they were trying to compensate for flavor. It also didn't sit well with our stomachs later. We would not come back as there are plenty of better burrito places around."}
{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO stars I would..: they are absolutely rude... Ask to speak to the district manager and they refuse information.. Will never order from this place. It has gone down hill since our last order when we were here in 2008"}
{"text":"I love a good breakfast burrito. Ingredients vary from place to place and some specialize in one type or another. Apparently the primary ingredient at burrito express is salt. The only time I've had that much salt in a breakfast burrito is when my children decided to make breakfast for me. At least they offset the salty with sweet gummy bears. All kidding aside, I normally would have given them a chance to fix it but I was on the road already and didn't want to go back. Ingredients were fresh and seemed to be of good quality so I gave them a star for that. They might of fixed it if I went back but I really shouldn't have too. So take this review with a grain of salt....."}
{"text":"Being from Northern California, it's hard to find good breakfast burritos in Arizona. Most of the places I've gone to have the eggs in a container ready to pour onto the flat top. Not here. I saw eggs in a crate, obviously cracked to order. 

The guy that took my order, the owner I think was really nice. The place is no frills which reminds me of the places in California. The food was great, the breakfast burrito hit the spot and I was stuffed. The red salsa is bomb. Definitely going to be back when I need a fix."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly, quick service and reasonable prices. Love the pictures of Villa on the wall."}
{"text":"Figured I would give this place a try and I figure I probably won't give it a try again. The kid at the window had a really big, extremely noticeable hickey on his neck, just unprofessional. Didn't have a very professional attitude as well, he didn't do anything but just seemed like he could care less. I ordered their chorizo burrito and added sour cream and bacon and it came to almost $8. Yikes! It was not $8 worth of size or taste that's for sure. There was a lot of salt and griddle taste and that was pretty much the sum of it."}
{"text":"Although I have been coming to this place for more than a decade and I love the food it's like comfort food from high school. But the last time I was in and received the worst customer service. The people that work there are rude and do not put the customer first. It makes me sad that management allows their employees to be so disrespectful and not offer quality customer service. I work for an organization that provides ALOT of business to their restaurant and now because I have had such a negative experience it saddens me that this will not be our normal lunch place. Hopefully they can read these reviews and work on their customer service and I will try them again in a few months."}
{"text":"Pretty decent burritos, I know they have a pretty big following that loves their breakfast burritos. This is not a fancy place by any means but it is clean and delicious.  Personally, I think that their location on Alma School and Elliot is is little bit better, but that could just all be in my head.  I would recommend trying a burrito if you have never had one before."}
{"text":"The name really says it all. Place your order and burritos appear at your doorstep post haste. What more do ya want?

Their menu is sparse; they don't do a lot, but what they do is done pretty well, perhaps with the exception of the overly salted taco meat... damn Salty. That cost them a Star. But, I'm still a fan, I'll re-order, and when I do, I'll be hoping to add back that Star.

Current favs - 
- The Burrito Supreme w/Shredded Beef
- The Green Chili Burrito
- The Bean Burrito

Gonna take a pass on -
- The Red Chili Burrito
- *Hard Shell Taco - *If ordering delivery, the shell will be soggy, that's a cardinal taco sin...  but not their fault."}
{"text":"So I gave it another try.  No changes. Very little bacon eggs or cheese. Too many burnt potatoes in the Brkfst Burrito Supreme.  They need to get new pans and clean them. The kitchen is dirty, you can see it from the window."}
{"text":"i order to go cause i was on my way back to Los Angeles, i got the Supreme Breakfast Burrito and let me tell you it hit that spot with the green salsa....fire...."}
{"text":"Always the best.... any burrito I have ever got there was perfect. Morning staff is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"We just had our first experience with BE and I'm writing this with mixed reviews. The prices are not bad at all. We called for delivery and were given the expectation for an hour. I called them after an hour and a half and they knocked a considerable amount off the tab, which was amazing and the doorbell rang literally a couple minutes later. The sauces were outstanding and the rolled tacos were out of this world! The guac was on point! The nachos were yummy but most of the chips were soggy because of the beans and ground beef weighing them down while being delivered. I appreciate they they served the cheese on the side, but an even-better-if would to be to put the meat and beans on the side as well. It would have been kind of fun to construct them ourselves! The burritos were what was a little bit of a letdown. We got the steak, cheese, and bean burrito and holy cow was it salty! I'm pretty sure that the meat was machaca instead of actual steak. It had the taste and consistency of of Taco Bell steak but was slightly more shredded. Overall, it was a mixed bag. On the website they boasted about a mesquite grill, so I guess that gave me an unrealistic expectation for the meat. I could see where this place would be the shit after margarita night!"}
{"text":"Go here. Look at the red faced dude. Order a breakfast supreme. You won't regret it. 

Don't forget the sauce either, try mixing the red and green. Delicious and great value as well!"}
{"text":"Normally I have been a fan of Burrito Express and order from them 5-6 times a year. My neighbor had food delivered to him yesterday and I was trying to relax in my home next door but found it impossible as there was a car with the bass so loud everything was vibrating. So I go out side and ask the guy nicely if he could turn the volume down when coming into the neighborhood. He is like, \"oh, I can't do that as they are 1200 somethings he said...., ya da ya da ya! I'm thinking REALLY!!!! So I told him that was rude/disturbing coming into neighborhoods with it that loud. He could have cared less! So today I call to talk to the manager as there wasn't one there when I called yesterday afternoon. She picks up the phone and I told her what happened. She is like - ok, I will talk to him. No sorry for the disturbance, no asking who it was (because she knew). She sounded like she could care less also. I told her he should have turned it off when he got in the car to leave. She didn't care. Then I asked her what her name was - because I didn't want someone pretending to be a manager who wasn't. She refused to give it to me. She said this is a family business and I told her I know as I order from you, but how do I know you are the manager if you won't give me your name. She didn't care, didn't apologize, just had a snotty attitude. Then a couple minutes after hanging up my phone rings and it is them again - thinking oh she is gonna apologize for her unprofessionalism. Nope! I answer and same girls voice \"Oops, got the wrong number\" - are you kidding me, grow up. So I am done doing business with them and my neighbor who ordered wasn't happy about the situation either. Two rude employees who obviously don't care that much about customer service for their family business."}
{"text":"Tried to order burritos for delivery at 5:45 on a Saturday evening when I called I was hung up on 3 times the 4th time I called it went to a recording saying they were closed. I don't care how good your burritos are if you can't order them.so in conclusion I drove to my usual favorite cafe rio. The one star is the same as a quarter tip to demonstrate cappy service."}
{"text":"I usually love little hole in the wall shops...but this one is pretty nasty. The kitchen is visible from the counter and it's gross. There are greasy fry baskets and dirty utensils strewn across the counters. I was starving so I ate half of my burrito.  I seriously hope I don't get the cha-cha's.  Hate to say it, but this place is disgusting."}
{"text":"Despite all the terrible reviews we decided to try this place for lunch since it's one of the only Mexican restaurants close by that delivers. We ended up really enjoying their food and the delivery girl is always super friendly. I usually get the all day breakfast burrito, delish and a couple of the beef tacos. Nothing fancy. If you're looking for gourmet Mexican, this isn't it. If you're looking for a couple of tacos during lunch and a place that delivers, this is it. The location is about 10 minutes away from us and we usually wait about 30-45 minutes for delivery."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Will not be returning not worth the money and the attitude from the employees is horrible, they act like they're bothered to help you"}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time. Good quick simple and cheap Mexican food. Then I saw their health inspection report online. If they thought about their customers they would be more diligent about sanitation."}
{"text":"The food is good cheap Mexican food. Dicey for sure. We love coming here! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I've been here multiple times were the cashier is using inappropriate language (not directed at me) while I'm standing there paying for my order. It's unprofessional and rude. 
We like to order the rolled tacos, bean and cheese burrito, quesadilla, green chile burrito, carne Assad burrito, and bacon potato and egg breakfast burrito. 
Try the food if you're in the area! Just expect a long wait. Sometimes we just call ahead and then the wait time is super short."}
{"text":"WOW...I guess this place doesn't need your business. 

They have \"steak, bean and cheese\"  burritos on the menu. I have no idea who would want refried beans over powering the taste of your steak, but I ask if they can make a steak tacos instead.

The kid taking my orders says its his first day and goes back to ask. Around this time the owner walks in and rudely says \"no, we will only make chicken and ground beef tacos\". Really, why? Will the steak not fit in a taco shell instead of a burrito. If I get your nasty refried beans on it, is it ok then? 

If I wanted ground beef I would go to Taco Bell. You are supposed to be authentic mexican food and you cant even make a carne asada taco? 

I guess if the line at Taco Bell is too long, this might be a good alternative."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, delivered.  I'm in heaven.  I get it at home, and at work.  I always order combination number 2.  The refried beans are some of the best I've had.  My only complaint is that it usually takes at least an hour for delivery because they're always so busy.  And I wish they were open 24/7, instead of closing at 9pm.  But still, a great alternative to Chinese or pizza."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast burrito selections in town.

My personal favorite is the breakfast supreme w/ red sauce ( and root beer the size of my head).

The decor may be meh, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it. 

They deliver, are always nice, and never busy (which is unfortunate). Definitely a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Awesome burritos, made any way you want. After reading some of the reviews, I will add some stuff on here. 

They now have an ATM. 
Still cash only. 
Still awesome taste. 
You can have the food made however you want, but you have to ask several times for it. 
Overall the food is great. 

Thanks to my co-worker for recommending this place.


-----------UPDATE-----------

Sooooo, burrito express got me into trouble at work.

My time at work several hours after eating went a bit like this....

My co-workers walk into the room, and stop suddenly staring at me.
I say \"Burrito Express\"
Together they all say \"Oh. . . . . . . OHHHHHH MAN!!!!! Come on!!!!!!!\"
Next thing I know, I am being told people's orders and being sent on a coffee run to get away from everyone.

Let's just say that this place does not agree with my body. I could barely stand to be in the car with myself. 
I know that might be more info than you want to read, but be careful with this place.

Burrito Express is now my Only eat when not working, and wife is at work place."}
{"text":"I would like to start off with saying myself and my work provide plenty of business and it's been so disappointing having this happen to me... I called in to play a delivery and paid over phone, the person who received the the order was unaware that I paid to she ended up paying them as well. After a long day we realized we had paid twice and called to get the situation handled, after several days pass it's almost like no one knows what's going on and I find myself calling these people back to back because no one can get back to me, finally I call one last time to ask about my double charge when one employee puts me on hold only to talk negatively about and tell her co worker that I'm a \"SUPER CUNT\" super unprofessional and no one handled this the right way. Everyone there seems to be extremely uneducated, and this review doesn't even cover half the shit they said / did while reversing a simple payment."}
{"text":"Had the chorizzo burrito with potatoes and cheese added... was AMAZING! Love this place. quite bummed we found this placec so close to the end of our lease as we would have eaten here more often the last year we have been here."}
{"text":"Got a coupon in the mail, saw that they had delivery and were only a few miles away- score! The entire family loves breakfast burritos, so figured we'd give it a try. Called in today about 10:15am, guy on the phone placed me on hold for a second, then politely took all of my order, delivery, and CC information. They were busy, so he said it would be about an hour. They were here in about 50 minutes and apologized for the delay. The delivery driver had a \"hot bag\" as my wife called it, and everything was still warm and fresh when we sat down to eat. Everyone took their first bite and said, \"yum, this is good\", almost all at the same time. =) Overall, couldn't be happier with the food and service from start to finish. And best of all, this was part of my wife's Mother's Day Weekend! Thanks for making it great KSO and staff. Order #222879"}
{"text":"Terribly ran. They close at 4 on weekends. Must not like money. The ONLY thing that keeps me coming back is their Steak potato and cheese burrito and the green sauce!"}
{"text":"Located on the SE corner on Ray and Gilbert road, Brito express is a Tucktaway little gym but continues to please mind and mouth's. Do not judge a book by its cover! There burritos are absolutely delicious, filled to the top with tasty high quality ingredients. Personally I like the carne asada as well as adobado. Oh and did I mention, the burritos are huuuge! It almost reminds me of the pre-2008 Chipotle days, when their burritos were absolutely gargantuan in size. If you got an appetite, Burrito express is the place to go. Check it out for a local alternative to Filibertos."}
{"text":"Burrito Express is a little walk up burrito shop right next to a Circle K convenience store. When we stopped it was a Sunday morning, and there were several people waiting outside fpr their food. After reviewing the menu, I decided on the bacon egg burrito. After paying we were given a number, and waited. It was a chilly morning, so I was getting cold while waiting. After a while our order was ready, and we took our burritos to the car where we dug in. The burritos are large, and I couldn't finish mine. The eggs were cooked perfectly, but the bacon was way over done and very salty. I could barely eat it due to all the salt! 
I was not impressed with burrito express and will probably not ne back."}
{"text":"I've never been to the store, I always order delivery. Delivery ALWAYS takes at least an hour (they do tell you this, but it can still be frustrating). A few times, it's been an hour and a half. The food is pretty tasty. They use a lot of the right ingredients. Some things that I dislike about their food:

It's always lukewarm.

The cheese is never really melted. I'm talking about on the enchiladas, here. Even on the refried beans, it's usually mostly melted but not completely so.

The enchilada sauce is very obviously canned and they do not cook it. If you've ever tasted the same canned enchilada sauce before it's been cooked and then after it's been cooked, you know what I mean. I suspect that they make the enchiladas and, while the enchiladas are still \"hot\", they pour refrigerated/freshly opened enchilada sauce over the meal and expect it to cook. 

I still order from them every so often, because there aren't any other Mexican food delivery places, but it's not great food. I've had much better food elsewhere but, hey, delivery."}
{"text":"The burritos here are absolutely awful. A co-worker ordered them for a group in the office, and not one of us were impressed. The flavor was disgusting, not sure what spices they use, as there isn't an ingredients list on their website, (first sign of trouble right there), and it was so salty! Most likely loaded with msg. Avoid this place, it's terrible. As I write, suffering with a stomach ache."}
{"text":"i went there for my lunch brake .I ordered rolled tacos with rice and beans.It was aweful i couldn't finish my meal.It was so grease and the beans were runny .Save your money dont go there trust me.I didnt even get a sorry or a refund."}
{"text":"My co-worker orders burritos for our team every other week. Every time, I order a burrito with only beans. Not complicated, right? One time, there was cheese on the burrito. But they did fix that situation by making a new burrito with only beans and delivering it free of charge. So no big deal. However, this time, they left my burrito off the order altogether. When my co-worker called back, fully prepared to pay for the burrito that was left off, they told her she would have to make at least a $15 order for them to do another delivery. My burrito is only $3.55. We should not have to order a bunch of unnecessary stuff just to get the burrito my co-worker ordered the first time around. It was their fault they left it off the order, and especially with how frequently we do business, you'd think they'd at least be willing to make it right. It's not like we were even asking for a free burrito. And it's not their first mistake. Very poor customer service. While my team may continue ordering every other week, I will definitely be reconsidering doing business here again."}
{"text":"Great burritos at a great price!  Service was really quick too! I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"I go here all the time (alma school and Elliot) and never had issues. However the last 2 times I've placed pick up orders, the younger guy places me on hold for at least 5 minutes. Tonight I was close by so decided to drive there as I was on hold. I get there and he was on his PHONE while I was still on hold and he had NO customers. Quick way to lose business!"}
{"text":"Very poor order taking and delivery service. Placed an order and was told it would be 45min wait. Called back for status of order after an hour and was told driver left anout 10min and should almost be there. Tried for 20min to get through to someone, happen to be the driver. Said he called 3 times and text the number provided. Woman who took the order wrote the wrong phone number, address after being repeated more than 3 times when given. She needs to go back to school to learn more on listening and order taking. Never ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Foods consitant, been here many more times than three. If you enjoyed it once you will continue because it's consistent"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! 
First time coming asked for a supreme breakfast burrito and a green chili. (Thinking I ordered breakfast one)We got it to go and then to my surprise it literally was only green chili and tortilla... I mean I would only think they would ask and check do you want the one with egg or no egg. But nope NEVER coming here again. And the only reason I would think they would ask cause we were there at 8 am"}
{"text":"The most pointless location. They're only open from 8am-4pm, so they're open too late if you want a burrito before you go to work and they're closed too early if you want a burrito after work. Unless you happen to be in the area around lunch, you're out of luck."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos around.  Everything is made fresh and you definitely get your money's worth.  Food is made really fast even when the place is packed.  Do yourself a favor and try them out."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but every time it's something different. Either they are out of cups, or out of the normal size tortillas, or they didn't put cheese on the Steak, egg, and cheese burrito. It's always something. This time I come home to find that one burrito is tiny and the other is normal. I just can't take the inconsistencies anymore. How disappointing."}
{"text":"A great burrito! I really like the shredded beef burrito and tacos. It is really juicy and tender meat. A great place to pick up food to take out for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"This location is poorly maintained and dirty. Don't know how they pass inspection. Food was undercooked and didn't taste good at all. Hours of operation make no sense either. I will never return to this location!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat the best burritos. I always get the steak burrito and the steak is cooked to perfection. The customer service is always on point and I always feel like they care if I enjoy my meal. Their breakfast menu is to die for as well. I always love coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Everyone has been telling me to try burrito express. I walked up to the register and wow the kitchen was DISGUSTING. They had chopped up food in bowls literally on the floor. I walked out because I was so grossed out ."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week and I seem to love it more and more every time I go in. The employees are genuinely nice and do whatever they can to help you. If you love Mexican food, this would be the ideal place to go."}
{"text":"Extremely rude at the counter, blonde haired balding guy. 

Walked in,  I came from 12 miles away to continue to show my patronage. I will NEVER return. 

Had a sleeping baby and asked if he could bring the order out to the car when it was done. Said \"No i cant\"  as if the 3 people sitting in the place would destroy it or something. I asked if he would if I paid extra. Phone rang and he put the person on hold. I said, \"so if I called in and asked for delivery, would you deliver it as far as your parking lot?\" They guy said \" No we wouldn't\" ,and put his finger in my face and said \" I'm going to take this order\", and picked the phone back up. 

Clearly, these people care nothing about their customers, just their money. Good for you guys. Hopefully, people catch on to this. Your business will fail, regardless of your food."}
{"text":"Burrito steak and potato with cheese ... I keep coming back its that good........And will definately come back again yuppppl."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place by accident and grabbed a breakfast burrito. So delicious! Ordered and my food was ready in five minutes and this is D Lish! Green salsa is divine."}
{"text":"I am FURIOUS about this restaurant. Don't waste your time! I have tried three separate times to go to this restaurant and found them closed DURING OPEN HOURS. Today, I had the day off of work, called to confirm that they would be open after reading on google that they would be open, and then DROVE ALL THE WAY from DOWNTOWN PHOENIX to Scottsdale only to find them CLOSING with all the chairs up and the staff not willing to prepare my husband and I any food. I called at 11:13. The staff member said that they were open until 3 pm. I arrived at the location at 1:23. That is one and a half hours before their stated closing time. My husband said to the staff member that we had called to confirm the closing time and he looked up from sweeping to say, ' uh we closed bro. It's Memorial Day isn't it?' Um, no. It was definitely Labor Day and still were not supposed to close until 3 pm. I called JUST to make sure. This restaurant is a joke, a disappointment, and a straight up waste of my time and gas."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken tacos, chorizo and egg burrito, and a bean burrito. Everything was tasty, well seasoned, and come with salsa. I'd prefer more salsa with my order. Service is quick and friendly. The sitting area is tables and plastic chairs. It gets awkwardly silent because they have no background music or tvs."}
{"text":"Usually I have had tacos here and they were excellent! Today I ordered three beef tacos and was so utterly disappointed. There was barely any shredded beef and it was loaded with shredded lettuce. There were small little scraps of beef just thrown in on my greasy hard shelled taco. My husband got a supreme burrito that was totally messed up.   It wasn't even his order. Just so disappointed in quality. I won't ever go back there again."}
{"text":"Great food!!!  Great price!!! Speedy service!!!

As a small business owner myself it is amazing how consistent the food service and prices are. 

If there is a question if you should go here or order delivery it is definitely worth the try. 

Favorite burrito is the STP steak potato and cheese. The steak has a distinct salty taste that is to die for. 

The red sauce is amazing I wish they sold it by the gallon. 


Love this place."}
{"text":"it was terrible. it looked like the food wasn't prepared correctly. the soft tacos were soggy with grease. the nachos were a 2.7 out of 10. we didn't mind the wait because we ordered the food for delivery but the quality was the worst. the \"steak\" on the nachos looked like beans. BEANS. never again."}
{"text":"The food is always so-so. I love their rice. But last time I ordered the delivery driver didn't have my side of rice & said I'd be comped. The charge for rice was never removed :("}
{"text":"To start off, I LOVE burrito express, minus this store. 

We went here last week as a walk in and the cashier told us to hold on while she finished her text. 

Tonight, we called to place an order. The girl answered the phone and said to hold, then hung up. We called again and the phone rang with no answer. We then drove to the location as this is what we want for dinner. We ordered the food and while waiting, we noticed the food prep was not done with gloves. 

After the food was made, we asked for the manager. The manager said they were having credit card machine issues and it might be the phones too.. She said it's never happened before and \"When you come back again and this happens again, we can maybe talk about a discount.\" 

We called the store while standing there and the phone rang. This is the last time we'll come to this location."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Like home-made goodness, with tasty, tender beef, creamy beans, and flavorful cheese. It's f-ing fantastic!   And the sauce... THE SAUCE!
What's not f-ing fantastic, is the service. The owner often is there, and he's a great guy, but the others guys don't seem to want to be there. One dude in particular. A fat kid that Exudes how much he doesn't want to be there. He's got gorgeous green eyes, but you'd never know because he Refuses to make eye-contact... If he were to be fired, this particular BE would get 2 more stars. Go to the new BE by ASU on University and Rural. Those guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"Good old Burrito Express. I could drink their salsas. Beef, bean, and cheese gets packed into their tortillas to make one big burrito for 6$. This location in particular has really great staff"}
{"text":"Extremely frustrating when you drive all the way out of your way to go to this location before they close at \"6pm on Sunday's\" to arrive at 5:30pm and find them closed. Be true to your posted hours so you don't waste people time. Huge disappointment"}
{"text":"Always go to this store in Gilbert. Best green chili around. Do have OK occasional issues with miscommunication in your orders. Have a couple orders that had to be returned. Aleays get an apology and correct order at no charge! Cory is helpful and makes it right. Best choice and good service! Wish they would take debit cards having to stop for cash now a days is a bit of hassle."}
{"text":"Ouch.... Where's the rolled tacos? $3.60 for these? Yikes... Sorry guys, I wanted to love it but Waa Waaa!"}
{"text":"As I keep trying to explain to various family members and friends: 

When you're craving delicious Mexican eats - Skip the hoity toity, \"high on price and low on quality\" fancy joints and drag yoself right to a place a la Burrito Express. 

This place is less than two miles from my home and \"conveniently\" on the way home from the weightlifting center I train at. 

Which is really freaking dangerous. 

Two burritos for $12 or less, are you kidding me?

These guys have one of the BEST breakfast burritos in town. 

I'm a creature of habit so I haven't ventured much beyond the Hot Machacha Breakfast Burrito or the Bacon and Egg (with added potatoes and cheddar) Breakfast Burrito. 

The meat in the Hot Machacha is always tender. Not so sure about spicy, but you can throw in the complimentary red sauce to dial it up a smidgen or two. 

The Bacon and Egg is a simple classic. The best way I can describe this? Fluffy eggs, plenty of crisp bacon. The added cheese and potatoes are simply because duh, complete breakfast in a tasty warm tortillas. 

Honestly the burritos are ginormous (see picture) and two adults with normal appetites could share one and feel satisfied ... Which is usually what I'll do with El Hubs Andrew \"The Dude\" C. 

However, try and split a breakfast burrito with me after a 2+ hour Saturday training session? Long hike?

From my cold dead hands you will have half of my burrito, muthafugga. 

IDGAF = I Don't Give Away Food. 

One of these days I'll try one of their non-breakfast burritos. 

PS: They deliver."}
{"text":"Burrito Express is the right place to go to if you want low priced, low quality food with a poor environment. The customer service is poor and we personally found that while dining in, the chefs and cashier were overly loud. Making it very difficult to converse. I do not see myself returning in the future."}
{"text":"5 stars for the bean and cheese burrito!!! This dive is nothing fancy, but the bean and cheese burrito is delicious and the red hot sauce is amazing! My hubbie likes the chorizo, but any of the breakfast burritos will do. My one hesitation about the food here is the enchilada sauce, it's from a can and not very good. Otherwise, go eat and enjoy!"}
{"text":"My order always includes a Supreme Breakfast Burrito. It's so good, I haven't really tried other entrees on the menu."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best burritos I've ever had and they cost barely anything. Service is great and they deliver for a min fee"}
{"text":"This place is okay. I got a green chili burrito. It was filled with 25% meat and 75% green chili sauce. It was good but very messy to eat as a burrito. I wanted to dump the contents in a bowl and eat like a soup. I will have to try another burrito for better judgement. PS cash only."}
{"text":"This place was ok. I got a breakfast carne asada cheese burrito. The meat was too chunky for me. Didn't taste like the best quality meat. It was a good size for $5 . I might have to try it again to decide if it's just a meh kinda place or a Wow kinda place (but I doubt it) lol I come from San Diego so nothing compares to their awesome Mexican food ;)"}
{"text":"Bad customer service. When calling to place a pick up order, they are rude. Especially the female manager who answers the phone. Called ahead and was told 15-20 mins. Arrived 20 mins later and my order was not even started. No apology was given. Waited an additional 20 mins. The cooking area was unorganized. Dropped food was all over the floor by the stove area. The building itself is outdated, walls are dirty. The food is very average."}
{"text":"Burrito Express is the most important thing that has ever happened in the history of the United States of America. The steak potato and cheese burrito is the only thing that matters in the universe. It makes me want to freak out all the time. I think about it and I just want to throw glass on the ground and freak out and scream and panic because I want it so bad. It's the best burrito I've ever had in my life, hands down. Also their sauces in those cold containers really make the experience... Hats off Burrito express. Don't you ever change"}
{"text":"The shredded beef and chicken meat was very good. The burrito supreme was a great sized portion, the tacos were OK sized portions. They did not leave off tomatoes per my request. The tacos and burritos were lacking extra flavor by not including things like lettuce, cheese, salsa. I had to add all the extra stuff when I got home.

I paid $2 extra to make it a combo for a side of rice and beans, but the portions were absolutely tiny, not worth it. They also tried to charge $0.85 for a dinky cup of sour cream, no thanks."}
{"text":"What the hell is going on here at Burrito Express?  After sitting for 20 minutes waiting for our food the management comes out and tells the whole dining room that they have run out of tortillas.  Mind you this is a Saturday at 11 30 a.m..  Great food but I am getting sick of the poor customer service here and long wait times."}
{"text":"So when my family and I can't decide what to eat, we choose a burrito shop out of a hat. We came across Burrito Express and it is the best we've had. Been there a handful of times now and the never disappoint. They're always really friendly too!!!"}
{"text":"Nothin' fancy, just a quickie burrito take-out place that serves up your basics for large portions at a reasonable price. They serve breakfast burritos all day, so I went for the supreme breakfast burrito ($4.50). It was a large burrito filled to the brim with ham, strips of bacon, egg, and potato. It was delicious, and I gobbled up every bit! 

Cash only, so come prepared."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was in 7th grade and it still is my favorite. Hits the spot everytime."}
{"text":"I have gone to the Chandler location for many many years and have got way better service at that location. Burritos still just a good at this one though."}
{"text":"My favorite place, hands down for a bean burrito! Their salsa is amazing too!!! And I recently tried their breakfast burritos and I'm hooked!!!"}
{"text":"Had their burrito with steak, potatoes, and cheese. So worth the price! I will be going back :)"}
{"text":"Oh-em-gee. I just ate...no, I just inhaled a breakfast burrito from here. I've never eaten here before this morning and it was fantastic! I had the machaca breakfast burrito, the tortilla was nice and not dried out - I almost wonder if they make them there and the meat was nice and tender and juicy. I ate it with their green salsa, SO FREAKING GOOD! 
I will be eating here again! AND THEY DELIVER! Huge bonus!"}
{"text":"So, if I were thrashed and needing food like NOW, I'd give it better stars. It was sub-par ingredients thrown onto a plate and cost boyfriend and I about $15. 

He got the Nacho Supreme. It's comparable what you'd get at a Little League snack bar. Chips, \"cheese sauce\", dry shredded chicken, olives, and jalapenos. Let's say the only thing gone from the plate at the end of the meal were the chips. 

I got the \"chicken and salsa\" burrito. It was mostly shredded chicken (which was dry, by the way), mixed in with some salsa (very spicy), about 10 strips of shredded lettuce, and unmelted shredded cheese. The tortilla was the best part. 

Don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"We placed a to-go order from this location - five burritos and two nachos - and went to pick it up and was ASSURED it was all there.  I return to my office and we have one order wrong, missing one burrito, and missing all sides (sour cream, guac, etc.).  I called and repeated what I was missing and was told it would be delivered in 20 minutes or so.  I told them no, I had already waited 45 minutes and would not wait more and wanted a refund for the missing items.  From this point, I was put on hold, hung up on, and the phone just left on the counter while they would cackle and talk in the background for ONE HOUR.  Finally, a co-worker had to trick them into speaking to her, because every time I would call they would immediately put me on hold.  The customer service at this establishment is FAR from what we should ever have to deal with.  The young kid, at least by how he acts he could be 12, named AJ needs help and needs to find a new career where he never speaks to anyone ever again because he has no idea how to act like a civilized human being."}
{"text":"Mediocre and definitely not worth the hour and 27 minute wait to have them deliver less than 4 miles away. Annnnd they forgot my sour cream. Never. Eating. Here. Again."}
{"text":"I stopped here a few weeks ago when I was feeling under the weather and was craving something spicy to help clear my sinuses. I walked into the little shop and there was one guy enthusiastically manning the counter. I took a look at the menu and he asked if I'd ever been there before. I said no and he asked me a couple of questions to see what I was in the mood for and I went with the steak and salsa burrito. I ordered the combo (add rice and beans), a medium horchata (which is giant), and headed home. The burrito was a good size and I took a few bites before deciding to add some salsa to kick it up a little. The steak was not what I expected (think chipotle steak), but it was good, albeit a little salty. There wasn't rice and beans in the bag, so I'm guessing that it went in the burrito and if so, there was hardly any to taste. In a daze I didn't really check. I am a big burrito person so I would probably give this place a second try."}
{"text":"Love the food here and the service used to be great, but the new people working here are terrible. Went in this last weekend and the lady taking our order was really rude. We waited a long time to get our food and when we finally got it, she had put my order in wrong so I didn't get what I paid for. I tried to be really understanding (as they seemed really busy in the back) and said not to worry about it and I would just keep what they gave me (mostly because I didn't want to have to wait for them to take their sweet time correcting my order). The food was good. The employees were terrible. The lady in charge was yelling at everyone else the entire time and there was a male employee talking back and making stupid comments every time she said something to him. We sat there trying to enjoy our food, but had to listen to them arguing and yelling at each other the entire time. This place used to be great, but we don't plan on coming very often anymore as the employees here ruin the entire experience from the moment you walk in."}
{"text":"This place is a stink hole! I havent been to this place in years and now I remeber why!! the decor is crap and dirty, i hesitated to even order food afraid of what it like when they prepare the food YUCK!!! I had a buy 1 get 1 free coupon so thats the only reason i went .
 Sausage burrito was salty, potatoes was old (extra .60) and it looks like generic yellow cheese( extra .50).
 Im done with this place I wish you the best of luck if you choose to eat at this dump....."}
{"text":"Good food. Decent prices. Can't say I've ever had a bad trip. There is nice menu to choose from and it all feel authentic.

 Great burritos and well cooked (not over cooked in a pot) ground beef.  Tacos are notvbad either. And I always end up getting too many beans."}
{"text":"I've lived and known about this place for 7 years and I finally went there. I had the steak potato and cheese. It was really good and really filling. The prices were really reasonable and the staff was friendly. I will for sure go back there!! Yumm!"}
{"text":"Hit and miss.  Incredibly slow service but great food.  Been in 3x in the last 2 weeks and each time I was the only person in the restaurant and has taken 15-20 mins for a single burrito and single taco."}
{"text":"The sign proclaiming \"best breakfast burrito\" lured me in.

\"So you have the best breakfast burrito?\" I said to the dude at the counter.

\"Well,\" said he, \"we haven't tested it against all other burritos.\"

I assured him this was okay, as I wasn't doing a scientific study. I ordered the chorizo burrito, which is $4.40.

It is a large burrito, really more a burro, containing chorizo and scrambled eggs. No nonsense with onions or tomatoes -- you got your chorizo, you got your eggs. This is how it should be. The tortilla tasted fresh, and the chorizo/egg ratio was generously tilted toward chorizo, though the chorizo had a few odd gristly bits. As served, it was a better-than-average breakfast burrito... and with a drizzle of the salsa verde, it was a truly fine breakfast burrito. If I lived down in this neck of the woods, I'd be back to try more flavors.

The place is a little dive hole-in-the-wall in a rural plaza where there are hay bales in the parking lot and the shop next door sells live chickens. You can get the free Gilbert newspaper from the rack out front and entertain yourself with the police blotter and the local restaurant inspection grades."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery and it never showed up.  I'd put zero stars if yelp let me.  Now I have to go down to there establishment and pick up my food that they charged me for over 1 and a half hours ago.  Unacceptable.  Fuck this place!"}
{"text":"YES YES YES. Burrito Express MAY just have the ABSOLUTE best Breakfast Burritos in THE EAST VALLEY. The Supreme Breakfast Burrito!!! In the words of the prolific Ke$ha: \"I'm addicted. It's a crisis!\" The mastery of eggs, cheese and meats, doesn't end there, however, and I highly suggest the HOT MACHACA burrito! It will BURN YER MUTHAFKKN FACE OF, YO. Their crispy beef tacos are stellar, and just about everything else I've tried has been, as well. ALSO, they DELIVER... (I don't get stuff delivered.. but they do!) The only disappointment has been.. items containing ground beef.. which is fine, because, eww.. ground beef.. (not a huge fan) D:"}
{"text":"Should be called : Salty Burrito Non-Express. They took 45 min in correctly make two breakfast burritos. Young kid on register didn't seem to care about his mistake. The supposedly manager who looked infected with a giant band aid on his neck didn't give to craps, took another 10 minutes to fix the burrito mistake. No apologies. Poor Management Wife didn't end up eating her burrito as it was too salty. Express implies speed, fast. This is not a Express location!"}
{"text":"Well....the supreme breakfast burrito is good, but that's about it. I've been here 3 times since open...each time the service has been slow and borderline rude. If they want customers to come on 30 minute lunch breaks, or on their way to work, they need to step it up. (Especially considering there are many other options nearby: Los Favoritos is only a mile away)"}
{"text":"I just ordered from these guys and I'm giving a 5 star review on just that part of it... the ordering. The reason I'm doing this, is the guy I spoke with ( Vernon), was one of the most friendly and cool cats to talk to. I told him it was the first time I ordered something from a flyer left on my door knob and we both got a laugh out of that and it went up from there. He was knowledgeable about his menu , he was enthusiastic and helped me decide what to get,  even let me know that he'd be the guy that was going to be delivering it. So far so good I really hope the food lives up to the customer service. Will see you in about an hour.

Fast Forward to a few hours later.... 

I wish I could have left the 5star review for the customer service, Vernon was an amazing guy, but the food was not so much amazing. 
First
The order was a minimum of $15 for delivery. I always try and tip at least a fiver... so it cost me $23 (18 meal, 5 tip). First thing I noticed was the leaking Dr Pepper on my counter. The no straw for my drink. No utensils for the food and no napkins. I did let them know I was new here and had nothing in my apartment yet (food or utensils)... so maybe Vernon was not as cool as I think. I am hoping it was not him who made, packed my meal. If it was *sigh* I have no more hope in humanity. 

Next was the opening of the boxes to reveal my glorious $23 meal! and... you know the sound a firecracker makes when it's a dud... THAT. The rolled tacos looked like unsharpened pencils (but harder to break), The quesadilla cold and lifeless (I have seen way better ones made outta bread and those kraft singles in my microwave). The burrito looked like a doughy ghost... I know this seems harsh.. but y'all did not have to eat this after waiting so long to eat and btw.. I threw most of it away. Pics coming. The tortilla was PURO MASA... dough and sticky. Fell apart within seconds. The beans were can quality (not the good stuff.. the generic kind you find at the canned giveaway at your kids school).  At one point (HONEST) I was choking on one of the rolled tacos... and what went through my mind was OMG I DON'T WANNA DIE FROM THIS HORRIBLE MEAL.

I know I know... maybe they are not the devil. I never buy food from flyers because I am afraid of this sort of thing. I read a few reviews on YELP and this was why I used them. I may try them again. I would have call them first to let them know about my review.. I am not a talk smack behind your back kinda guy... but these cats took my money and promised me quality... I got 2nd rate. If the manager reads this... contact me and we can chat. 

There is more, but you get the gist, I was not happy with my meal, so I got McDonalds. Gotta go... SO HUNGRY!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for over 5 years (mostly including the location at baseline and higley) and that should be explanation enough for the 5 stars. I don't venture much past my usual \"steak potato cheese\" burrito, but I've had their sides of rice and beans, horchata, and both red and green salsa (careful, that stuff is addicting), and I've never left regretting I went. It's $5 bucks for the best, most fresh and most consistently DELICIOUS burrito you can find north of the border. I'd take this over filiberto's any day of the week. Also, Did I mention that red salsa....  

They recently remodeled the Gilbert rd location and its lookin great. It's got places to sit, unlike the other location at baseline and higley which is connected to the circle K outside, with a pair of concrete tables with umbrellas to sit at, not bad on a nice day. I'm probably going again this week, my mouth is literally watering now after writing this."}
{"text":"This place has ruined me for all burritos!  My friends and I have been going almost every Friday for the last several years and I crave it more than that.  The steak, potato, and cheese with red sauce is my go-to but they have a burrito for everyone!

Also, they made the news [bit.ly/1F4YPow] when the owner stuck to his guns and refused to be treated poorly by a foul-mouthed former customer (by mutual agreement)."}
{"text":"This is the only delivery burrito I've ever found, but I sadly live too far now (they actually cover a pretty big radius). I love getting a bean burrito with lettuce, tomato, and guacamole inside, which I'd never even bother ordering at another Mexican food place. They use good quality guacamole, the beans are cheesy and perhaps a bit salty, but the tortillas are really the best part. Each burrito is huge, and you can get a combo for around 5 bucks (or less). People really love their breakfast burritos, my husband likes the potato, egg and cheese with guacamole. Perfect for hangovers. Opens earlyish, at 8!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos. Bacon (or sausage) egg and cheese, steak&egg, and bean&cheese are our favorite go to's. Call ahead if you're in a rush, but by the time we get our drinks and fill up our car our burritos are typically ready."}
{"text":"I love this place everyone there are so friendly.  I really love the breakfast burrito supreme. I have to thank my Co worker for introducing me to this place ."}
{"text":"Decided to give it a go today.  I had seen a line of construction workers a month ago when I was there.  It was a great choice.  Had the steak, bean and cheese.  Excellent!  Defiantly will be a regular customer."}
{"text":"Burrito Express is a delicious choice for a Mexican lunch. It is very different from the local taco stand (Filiberto's or Amado's) but that does not mean that it's not as good. The tortillas are extremely tasty."}
{"text":"Do NOT order an even semi large order... We've ordered several times for work and they always forget things, get orders wrong, take a long time to deliver and their customer service is terrible. They make excuses instead of just resolving issues as they should. They won't be getting any more of my business."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 10+ years.. The owner Angel is awesome.. they seriously have the best breakfast burritos in AZ hands down, along with more than half the menu."}
{"text":"My brother vouched for this place, but to say I was apprehensive is an understatement. It makes you wonder when you enter a dining room that's a big, empty space with no diners, and a stack of boxes and a car seat (?!) piled up in full view of the front door.

Ordered a chicken salsa burrito chimi-style, and my bro got steak, potato and cheese. We opted to take the food to go, because the seating area just wasn't inviting, and quite poorly lit.

Imagine my surprise when I cut into my chimi and found it to be hot and flavorful! I was worried it would be overly greasy and inedible (like my last meal at Filiberto's...yeeeeck), but I ate the whole thing and my intestines didn't protest! The side of Mexican rice, though, was old and dry and crusty and downright bad.

So while there were some negatives, I did get a decent chicken chimi for cheap. It may be worth it to go back and try out the breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"We have tried and tried this place.  I think it's time to give up.  When we order food to go and get home to realize it's completely cold, like pre made out of the fridge cold, it's frustrating."}
{"text":"I am giving this business 5 stars because their burritos are delicious! I just had to stop going there because the chicken got too spicy for me so I am no longer a customer because of that. If they ever add a milder version of the chicken to the menu I will be back, along with my family!!"}
{"text":"My brother first showed this spot a couple years ago. I have never turned the chance down to come in. The breakfast burritos are top of the line amazing. If you order a breakfast burrito get the breakfast supreme it's the best. Love that it is family owned. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Steak burrito with beans and cheese...! =) mmmmmm good spot for a fast good burrito. There salsa is also very good I tend to get the green but always one red. They are always generous."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I always order the red chili burrito, enchilada style with red sauce. Oh man, it's delicious! Prices and service are equally amazing! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Before I give my review 

I moved here from Texas and we  have excellent quality Mexican food on every corner. Down to the homemade tortillas and fresh homemade salsa and chips that are always free at every Mexican restaurant. It's an expectation there. So sadly im here still wondering where I'm going to find my chips and salsa for free..booo..lol.

SERVICE
I walked into this place thinking ahhh it's another filibertos place and it will taste the same. From the time I walked in, I was greeted and treated like I was one of their friends. He went above expectations just by letting me know they have a closer location to where I live and asking if the food was great and salsa.


THE FOOD
Steak potato and cheese burrito was ordered. I haven't had a great burrito in a long time. Plenty of meat and taters as the country folks would say in Texas. It was amazingly excellent. Nothing fancy about the burrito, this goes where they say...Keep it simple stupid....they did just that....and that makes this burrito....darn good!!!

Chicken Tacos, were ordered. The guy really knows his stuff and makes ordering easier. He asked if I wanted one or two and then when I said two, he said you might as well go with the #17 or something like that for .14 cents more and get yourself a drink. I did just that. Back to the tacos. I was expecting some super hard shelled taco with hardly any cheese and little meat. I was wrong. The tortilla was fried lightly which is the exact way I love making my own corn tortilla tacos at home. I was surprised with that part already and the amount of cheese way more then you would get at taco bell anyday. The tacos are excellent.

Breakfast Burritos-I went back the next morning I ordered the potato, cheese, ham and bean taco. Wow!! Amazing with plenty of cheese and the greatest red tasting hot sauce I've had around.

Don't hesitate to ask me any questions....I prefer this place and will go out of my way to get here than to go to Filabertos!"}
{"text":"Food:

Decent at best

Customer service:
In order to keep myself from writing a novel, I have decided to keep it simple, the customer service was HORRID. God help the staff that has to deal with the counter-clerk (terrifying enough the clerk may be the manager as well), it took over an hour to deliver about 2 miles from the location in which the staff was polite-ish.
No apology for the lack of service nor anything else.

Overall, a place I'll visit when I don't think highly of myself."}
{"text":"EXPRESS if your driving a burro LOL  definitely not . It took over an hour for delivery and was told I was the only delivery the driver had . The food I cant understand how some people said it was the best they ever eaten. wow they must of had some seriously bad Mexican food or maybe taco bell to compare too. It definitely is not the best in anyway at all or even close come on. everything tasted like it came out a can the sauce for the green was wierd tangy taste and the red was watery and very little meat from the can in there and the beans sub par by far flavorless. The enchiladas was a miss my wife didn't even eat them and she loves enchiladas her fav these didn't even temp her to finish her plate at all. Then the tacos where put together weird lettuce on bottom and skim of meat on top don't need to change what is already done but you can try to make it better. this definitely didn't do that..  I have to say my son said the breakfast burrito he had was good and enjoyed it. maybe we ordered the wrong things but hell green chile , red chile , tacos and enchiladas sounds pretty basic Mexican food to me and should be good at any Mexican food place express or sit down.."}
{"text":"Much better service! Huge improvement, hopefully they  got rid of the bad eggs. I like this place, but it's a hit and miss. Great food."}
{"text":"For fast Mexican food I like coming here and I always end up getting the chicken, potato and cheese.. The chicken is already spicy to start with which makes the burrito taste even better .. I just wish they had more locations around .."}
{"text":"Friday night 8pm or so.  Awesome food. Thank you. Don't change a thing :) Perfect rolled tacos, guac and sc on the side :) Steak, bean and cheese burritos are my favorite. Best burrito yet from y'all . Thank you again for the delivery so late. Cheers, Bob"}
{"text":"Their breakfast burritos are delicious, but:

Strike 1: You call in to place a pick up order and are often put on hold for several minutes.
Strike 2: Prices have risen almost $1 per burrito (close to 20%) in the last year.  They've raised prices twice.
Strike 3: They have enacted a new policy where you can't place a pickup order for less than three items.  I usually order one burrito and I am too busy in the morning to drive to the store and wait 15-20 minutes for my order.  I like to call it in and pick it up when I walk in.  I don't understand this policy, but it is the last straw.

So....three strikes and you're out.  Burrito Express has lost my business.  I have to say, breakfast burritos aside, that their other menu items are not that great.  I've tried the tacos and most of the burritos.  There are plenty of other mexican fast food places around the east valley that are much better."}
{"text":"The best burritos ever.

I get the shredded beef and bean and add extra cheese. These suckers are juicy so make sure you have plenty of napkins. Add red sauce with each bite and you'll be absolutely in burrito heaven!

My babes gets the steak and egg and I hardly ever actually see the thing he mows through it so quick."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast Supreme burrito you can buy. I haven't really had any other menu items, but the burritos are fantastic."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend and they have been beloved by my office ever since. The staff is not only friendly but they make quality burritos at all times of the day without inconsistency. If you want a quality meal at any time of day for around $5 this is absolutely a must."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Burrito Express for almost 10 years, this location specifically, and never had any issues. Food has been great! Great enough that I volunteered to stop this morning to get breakfast burritos for my entire office.... Unfortunately they weren't open at 8am like they have posted and like they usually are. Even though I saw employees inside, no one would answer the phone nor unlock the door. Now I have had to drive out of my way to get burritos at another restaurant that aren't even half as good. They say that one bad experience will lose a customer, that is true in this case, plus you are losing an office full of potential customers who have been hearing my raves of the burritos for years.... Thanks."}
{"text":"Burrito Express is the best place for burritos. It doesn't look that great inside with the plastic chairs but the food is outstanding.

Even the tortillas alone are tasty - they make them there. I peel the tortilla bit by bit off the burrito and eat that until I can peel anymore without the burrito falling apart.

You get a choice of red and/or green sauce to go with your burritos.

A long time ago they charged for using a credit card. It was a hassle always paying cash but the quality of the food made it worth it. Thankfully they stopped making you pay a transaction fee."}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed! Wanted to try them and finally went in. Stood their waiting for service, no one even made eye contact. Just ignored me, not a I will be with u in a moment. I turned and saw about 5 table with no food and knew this was gonna be a process. After the guy walked past the ordering point, looked at me, said nothing, I just turned and walked out! Bummed the service sucked I really wanted a burrito!"}
{"text":"Bad tasteful experience, I have years buying burritos here and today I had ordered some burritos ans the guacamole and the carne azada were absolutely salty couldn't eat the burros has to throw them away, talked over the phone to make this unsatisfactory experience and the first gentleman that answers the phone very nice and offered to reimburse me  to make the burritos again, I told him who do I have to talk to about that he said the manager. Comes to that the manager didn't even offer me to reimburse me either my money or the burritos he just apologized and he said that the guacamole is already made and comes in a package to their location and that the carne asada is salted there and their location and made their. Some businesses sometimes they have to do more than just an apology and have the customer satisfied it doesn't matter if you are reimburse with the same food but at least to make you feel that you are a valued customer this location is just not good for us anymore so we opted to choose another location where they sell burritos and very good they are called Los Favoritos on Cooper Road and Ray Road Gilbert Arizona check them out their menu has a very large variety of Mexican dishes + breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Went to this place about 3 weeks ago and the service was friendly and the food was great. Now I grew up on Indian food and I love spicy food. I usually eat my food with a lot of spices and have a tolerance to it. So the burrito I got was a bit spicy and it was really good. 

okay so Yesterday I went back. The service was RUDE and upset that i came in 5 minutes before close, which i apologized aboit as i had not realozed their closing time and i tipped them! So I asked for a chicken burrito with salsa like last time.  This burrito was SO spicy I could not finish it. In fact I had to get ranch to calm down my mouth. That burrito burned all the way down. I ate ghost chili peppers and it did not hurt this bad. Just sayin"}
{"text":"I am placing Burrito Express just inside the 3 star camp.  A qualified 3 stars, 3 stars for the category...little Mexican joints.  Is that a category?  If it's not it should be.

Anyway, just inside 3 stars.  Maybe 3.05433 or 3.06155.  Not as far as 3.14159 though.  Definitely not.  

I had a burrito with potato, egg, cheese and ham.  It was big.  Not huge but pretty big.  I mean it didn't bludgeon me with it's girth or anything but it was pretty big.  

It was good.  Not mind blowing good or anything but good.  Like I would have it again but I wouldn't drive far for it.  Like I would drive a few miles.  Probably only a few though.  Not a score of miles, that's for sure.  I would drive more than a couple but less than, say, 10 for one of their breakfast burritos.  Probably about 4 if I had to rate the burrito based on how far I would drive for it.  

But there are other places closer to my office with good burritos.  So if I was somewhere, say within about 4 miles of Burrito Express and I was in the mood for a large but not too large breakfast burrito that was pretty good I would consider going to Burrito Express.  I'm not saying I would definitely go, like I'm not making a commitment by any means here, but I would think about it.  Probably.  Then again, I might not.  I might forget about Burrito Express, actually.

What were we talking about?"}
{"text":"First visit - found this place on Yelp. 
Came for a breakfast burrito and it was delicious! I got the Breakfast Supreme Burrito (bacon, ham, potato, egg & cheese) and I was surprised how good it was. The potatoes are the little seasoned potato cubes and everything was fresh and not overly greasy. They are basically full strips of bacon and not bits. The green salsa is a favorite there but the red is good too. There's plenty of flavor in the burrito itself so I could be fine going for no salsa even. 
Also a great price point. I ordered 3 of the same burrito (not all for me) and with tax it was $16. 
The staff is helpful and friendly. 
Limited on hours open, I think it was 8am-3pm. I want to even say closed on Sundays. 
Definitely recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Where else can you find a place that delivers breakfast burritos? Not to mention that the food is EXCELLENT! I got the bacon and egg breakfast burrito as well as the supreme breakfast burrito and they were both awesome. Lastly, the customer service is awesome and the guy is always very friendly. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Stick to the bean and cheese burrito.  Anything else not so much.  Nachos are about as bad as a Mexican restaurant can do. We weren't impressed with the rolled tacos. Kinda like a burnt offering. Saw some people near us had some enchiladas.  I would probably try those."}
{"text":"The customer service was awesome and the prices are great but the burrito I got the tortilla was burnt and it had a burnt taste all the way through"}
{"text":"Not only is their delicious food always fresh and on point but every time we come in the guys are always really polite and accommodating. I appreciate how kind they are to everyone that walks in their door. The place is well kept and they always have sports on if you want to dine in and watch some tv. My favorite burrito is the supreme breakfast. I get it every time and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"Been a regular for years, put up with the kid up front with the bad attitude because my wife likes the breakfast burrito here even though I find them mediocre. My son who is allergic to avocado orders the rolled tacos which are greasy and over priced for what you get.  I ALWAYS ask for no guacamole because he is allergic to it.  Today they served it with guac.  When it was brought to their attention they pulled the receipt and instead of just fixing the issue the said that I never said no guac (which was not true) and then the kid actually fist bumped the cook!  What?!!  Who does that and it front of the customer!  We will never,  never go back! You just lost a loyal customer who put up with your crap service.  The only decent burrito was your BSB even though the bacon was extremely soggy.   Food is definitely not good enough to put up with that.  I'd rather eat a McDonald's breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"I tried to order for delivery (my crossroads are Gilbert and Guadalupe) and the employee who answered was already taking my order when he then put me on hold and comes back to say he cannot deliver to me. When I asked why, he gave me a big sigh and said he just couldn't. I asked one more time and he finally told me I am out of his boundaries and refers me to the baseline store. I called the other store; they were very polite when explaining how I was actually not in that store's boundaries because they were passed Higley; the employee there was so nice he even referred my call to the manager who stated that this location on Gilbert Rd should deliver to me."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito ever. I come here even for lunch and the breakfast supreme is incredible. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive to all of heir customers. If you're in the area, stop in or get some breakfast delivered at work. I do both.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great tasting food and speedy service, highly recommend over the competition."}
{"text":"Their customer service is very poor. When you give them your credit card number they write down on a piece of paper with all of your info. Not only that when you are hold you can hear them repeat other customers credit card info, address, and phone number. It also took an hour and a half after ordering our food to get it. Everything was soggy and really greasy. When calling to speak with the manager he did not want to listen and handed the phone back to a regular employee. I will not ever order from here again and have to watch my credit card account now because you never know if the employee who wrote your credit card info down will use it. So everyone beware."}
{"text":"Their Supreme Breakfast Burrito is the best Ive ever tasted! 
You always hear about the little \"hole in the wall\" mexican food place with the best food ever. Well this is it. I eat lunch there as often as I can."}
{"text":"Skip the green chili burro. It had only 2 pieces of meat barely big enough for a child's size meal and the rest was unflavorful, unseasoned green goop. I was stoned as fuck and still couldn't eat it. It was like a booger burro."}
{"text":"Better off getting a bigger burrito at Filaburtos. Burrito tasted ok. Beans taste like can beans."}
{"text":"Great food, great price! Got the burrito supreme always delicious.   Never an issue with the prompt service. No normal customer would complain as they are on the ball here.  Please keep your DB attitude away from this gem.  Red sauce is the boss. You are welcome."}
{"text":"The burrito was a joke really. I am pretty sure the beans were burned. The chicken tastes like its from a can. And the female who put my food on the counter called my number and sat it down and said nothing else. There were other orders so I didnt know which was mine. She stood right there talking to her new hire and said \"there\" and that was it. I have always wanted to try this place. But honostly,I dont understand how its in business. Why do people eat there? Its gross."}
{"text":"I'm here almost every weekend.  The steak and egg with added cheese it's a great burrito and the cost is even better. I do recommend having the green sauce, I could eat that stuff on everything."}
{"text":"Very bad service girl with tattos at the counter kept cussing to other employees and didnt care to acknowledge me. Food took a whilw to come out. A little over priced. No bad food but nothing special."}
{"text":"just tried this place and will never do that again.. the wait was over 15 mins long. then the guy told me he didnt even have my number. the guy had a crappy attitude. i was not the only customer there that was disappointed and frustrated"}
{"text":"Re-review love this place again. Had my favorite burrito again. Service great, made sure I was happy after the meal! I missed my green sauce! They seem to be back in step! Can't wait for my Saturday morning hung over burrito order!"}
{"text":"The place is a walk up to the counter and order, get your drink cup and fill it, then sit down and they will serve you.  I took my daughter here (and as always), when we go to a older or dated type place like this, she wants to know if it will be safe to eat the food. We both ordered the green chili burrito (enchilada style) with green sauce (as we prefer the green over the red) but they have both.  Anyway, this is some AMAZING green chili. I would highly recommend it if you like spicy food.  The salsa was also amazing and spicy also.   The staff were very helpful and polite even when they were super busy during the lunch hour rush and the food come out super quick!  They were doing a huge takeout business while we were there. Both take out and deliveries going out like crazy.   Firefighters even showed up to eat here and so I told my daughter that the food must be safe to eat or we wouldn't  be seeing firefighters eating here.  The firefighters actually improved the scenery quite a bit! Only problem was the guys got a call and had to jump in the truck on a call as soon as they made their lunch order.  My daughter said \"ahhhhhhh that's a bummer! Now they have to go back to work hungry.  LOL!  Anyway, this place was amazing in my opinion for a neighborhood hole in the wall considering the quality and the huge amount of food they serve you for the price."}
{"text":"Windows dirty, shoulda been my first clue. Ordered soft tacos, got fried tacos, and was told fried ARE their soft tacos, weird. Also, beef was cold, and returned. Guy asks me if I want something else. I say yes and tell him I want a burrito instead and he says it may not be to my liking because its soupy.  Uh, thanks for telling me you dont want my business. I received a refund for part of my order, because kids already bit into cold fried \"soft tacos\". Also, staff was dismissive when I asked for salsa behind counter and made me wait until another customer in line who had not been helped yet was rung up. I guess they don't believe in helping an open order...after my refund I heard cuss words and loud talking in front of kidd. Not classy, but neithr is Burrito Express at Hayden."}
{"text":"Had the signature steak potato cheese burrito and it was a let down. It was super salty and the price definitely reflects the quality of meat that's inside. The tortilla was just even ok. I wanted to like this place especially because I love supporting local businesses and community. The price is good but if in going to eat a cheat meal it better be freaking delicious!! Right?! Someburros blows this place away."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience! I called a day in advance to place an order for 100 burritos to be picked up the next day and the people at Burrito Express were so friendly and so helpful over the phone and in person when I came to pick up. They not only had everything ready at the time I came to pick up but they also made sure to give me plenty of napkins, a thank you card, and a box of candies! This place also really knows how to throw down on a burrito! Definitely will be a repeat customer! The office loved them!"}
{"text":"A simple burrito place with reasonably priced food and fast service, what's not to like?

I had the steak, potato, and cheese burrito for my first venture here. Their menu is limited but the quality of the burritos is still decent, just don't come here expecting a million options. I got my food quickly, it was hot, and for just over 5 bucks you can't beat the size for the price! It was filling and cured my burrito craving. 

The guys behind the counter here were working hard to prepare the food and didn't waste a second.  The place was packed around lunchtime with to go orders and dine in customers. There are only 4 bigger tables and two smaller tables, all of which were occupied on my visit. You order at the counter and then they call your number out. If you need a fast burrito at lunch time, this is a great place with good value!"}
{"text":"I stop at Burrito Express about once a month. I  think this location is new... 
It is attached to a corner store/gas station. 
You order at an outdoor walk-up window and they do have outdoor seating. I just get my order and go. Their other locations are indoors with restaurant seating tables and booths.
When I pulled into the parking lot on a Friday at 9:00am, there was a line of about 15 people. I just left, ran to an appoint and came back by at 9:45am... no line. 
I always get the Breakfast Burrito Supreme. It is only $5 and huge! It is delicious!! There is a reason this place is so busy. 
You can also call in your order and then go pick it up, and they offer delivery."}
{"text":"First off, I live near here and I am upset with myself that it has taken this long to try this place out.  

Steak potato and cheese burrito is my go to.  The steak is cooked to perfection and is a clean cut of meat not stringy at all.   The potatoes are cooked to a golden crisp that is perfect.   

Only thing I would change is to buy a time machine to try this place sooner.  Or to build an underground tunnel directly here to get my fix as often as possible."}
{"text":"Well, I guess I should have gone with the advice of the other Yelpers ! It was Saturday morning I got there at 7:45. They don't open till 8:00. I waited in my car , directly out front ! The only car out there . Watching people move around inside getting things ready . So I go to the door at 8:00 . And it was locked , peeked in and no one acknowledges me . They continued to do the prep work , moving floor mats around .. as I was still locked outside ! Finally at 5 after , I decided to get  back in my car and leave ! Just as I was driving away he decided to open the door !!! No  thank you !!  Rude !!!
Did not even get to try the food !"}
{"text":"Pretty good and they deliver! The nachos are excellent and they put the cheese sauce in its own container and is more than enough for an extra side of chips. Most locations are cash only which can be a bummer"}
{"text":"No don't do it... Don't eat here! I've been to this location twice. I didn't learn the first time. But that's me... I'm a person that will give second chances. The workers are really rude andi thought she was jus maybe having a bad day or PMSing...but when i went back for a second time i realized that she is just a really rude person and the burritos are just not good, they're edible but that's all. Bad attitude+bad food=BAD BAD BAD. ¹/² star is more like it."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have tried to eat here when they were closed during business hours. The first time they posted a sign on the window saying they ran out of tortillas at 11:30am on a Saturday morning. Now today (Saturday, May 27) they are closed at 1:30pm when their hours are open until 3pm."}
{"text":"I had A green chili burrito. This for sure was the worst burrito I've ever tasted. It had no substance to it. It was so flimsy and runny, I couldn't even hold it. I had to asked them to remake it and add rice. That did not help much."}
{"text":"Completely overrated. Never consistent in their burritos. Order breakfast burrito get no egg. Asked if the onions are cooked they say yes they're all Raw. I recommend Burrito Shack way better burritos."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. The order taker seemed annoyed I was taking him away from whatever he was doing. I ordered an egg, potato, and cheese burrito. It was awful. The potatoes were a gross purplish/brown color and just didn't taste right. I threw it away after the second bite."}
{"text":"Finally tried it! I like it! Steak and potato burro is the way to go. Friendly, every time I have ordered on the phone, and delivery is faster than expected. Good job."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I've eaten at other Burrito Express locations, and they are all good but this one is my favorite! The staff is super friendly, especially the red faced guy!! The prices are fair and the food isn't super greasy. I don't feel gross after eating here like I do at any of the \"berto\" places. If you need to get your burrito or taco fix, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Easy and quick. This is a typical burrito shop. It's connected to a gas station which feels a little sleazy but honestly it's pretty decent. I usually get the steak and egg burrito because it just hits the spot for me. 

It's just your typical Mexican food. No frills and nothing amazing. Be prepared because it's cash only. If you really don't have cash, then just buy something small at the gas station and get some cash out. No biggie. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"By far the best fast Mexican food I've had! I got a chicken quesadilla and it has a little bit of a bite to it (which the guy said it would) and I don't usually like spicy food but it's so good!!! They do it right!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, convenient to eat after the gym. The food is always tasty and the quality is fresh :)"}
{"text":"The steak, egg, and potato burrito is the bomb. I have been eating here forever. I was shocked to not see all five star reviews. I would love to buy a franchise if they franchised."}
{"text":"These guys have the best burritos around at a steal price. Additionally, they have that ideal starting business customer service but with a little more. They have willingly corrected orders with no hesitation and I'm confident they will continue to as they continue to grow.

Bottom line, if I crave a good burrito at a good price (breakfast or not) and I'm within 5-8 miles, I will go here without hesitation."}
{"text":"I can only vouch for the steak, potato, cheese burrito, the burrito is about 4 stars, but the sauce is 5 star. So good! Breakfast burrito is also pretty good. I had a chicken, potato, cheese burrito one time and did not like it at all. But I used to be addicted to the steak one!"}
{"text":"My son yelled, \"this is better than Chipotle!\" after his first bite... and he LOVES Chipotle! Then he listed off a bunch of pizza places that he loves, and thought this was better also! My two other kids loved the burritos also. Price is decent and the burritos are a nice size. The menu isn't that expansive, but then again, the name does focus on \"burritos\". We would go back again."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here still waiting on my burrito after 20 minutes. Eggs potatoes and cheese. No one really seems to know what's going on. The bathroom smells horrible. Other people are going up to the counter asking where their orders are. 3 people that came in after me with larger orders ended up getting out of there before me. This was the last time here. My mother inlaw likes to stop in here before we hit the road for Tucson. We have to find another place."}
{"text":"This is cheap Mexican food. You can get GOOD cheap Mexican food (see Senor Taco), but don't expect to find it here. The \"supreme\" tacos are hideously salty, we decided it's because the salsa is so salty. Tonight (because we had a 2-for-1 coupon) we went back one more time and tried a couple we hoped included less salt:
 - steak potato & cheese burrito (steak was OK, potato almost non-existent and little noticeable cheese; included some iceberg lettuce)(I am allergic to onion and asked them to leave out the onion, and he said \"there's NO onion in that one.\" Sorry, Jack, there was actually more onion than there was potato. I always carry pills when we go for Mexican because it's an integral part of the food and that works out for me, but don't freaking lie to your customers.
 - steak & salsa burritos. Not as salty as our first trip there. Was supposed to include cilantro - none detected."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, either you love it or hate it. This is not the case with me. I could take it or leave it. The store is a walk up window next to a convenience store/ gas station. I arrived Sunday morning just minutes after opening. There were several people waiting to pick up orders. The crew was working feverishly and somewhat chaotically to fill the orders. after a few minutes one person noticed me standing at the window and took my order. I then joined the several other people waiting for pick up. 54 degrees is not freezing, but when you don't have a jacket it can be a little chilly. After 7 minutes they started calling out order numbers. 
I chose to eat in my warm car rather than the patio. I ordered the breakfast burrito supreme. This consisted of scrambled egg, bacon, ham, potatoes, and cheese wrapped in a flour tortilla. My wife got the bacon egg burrito. They offered sauce which I regrettably declined as the burrito was kind of dry and bland. This was surprising because the bacon egg burrito my wife got was way salty. I took a bite to compare. What was also different was mine was barely warm and hers was very warm. My bacon was tough, almost burnt, hers was good. This inconsistency leads me to believe that they make these things in batches and not as they are ordered.
This is not the best fast food burrito I have had. Sorry Burrito Express, Jack in the Box or Filiberto's have you beat."}
{"text":"Awful service, mediocre food, and overpriced. Every time I go in there, it's like I am inconveniencing them by placing my order. I am never going back to this place. If you want good mexican in the area you should go to Elmer's, Taqueria Mi Casita, Si Señor (New Mexico), or mucho taco. There are probably a lot more than that!"}
{"text":"Awesome tortillas!

They are extra friendly and quick here. I've only had a bean and cheese burrito, but is good enough for me to continue ordering every time I go here."}
{"text":"I have been to a few of their other locations. They have been around for many years. They do a decent job on burritos and tacos definitely other places in the valley are a little better in my opinion. Their steak is a bit chewy. Quick inexpensive food. Very simple menu. friendly helpful service."}
{"text":"First, I like any place that uses homemade tortillas.  I feel like it was good food for the price.  We paid $17 for two good-sized burritos and two drinks. I got a steak burrito, which was really roast beef, not steak.  But it was well-cooked and well-seasoned.  They used runny decried beans as filler for the burrito, but again it tasted good. My wife had a chicken burrito which she said was super spicy.  I could see this being a great place if you need a cheap and filling lunch on the go.  I would eat here again, especially to try their breakfast burritos, but I would not make this a place on my regular list."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. I absolutely love authentic Mexican food and this place does not disappoint. I had the three taco plate and the salsa tasted amazing. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love burrito express! It's somewhere I must always go when I come into town. I wish I had a burrito express near me in Cali. I always get my burrito enchilada style with their green sauce and it's amazing."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing breakfast burrito. Tortilla was fresh, eggs were seasoned, and the salsa was SPICY! Good value, too. If you're looking for flavorful Mexican food, that is inexpensive a quick - this is your place."}
{"text":"This place was really delicious! We got two cheese and beef cheese crisps for our two kids. One could have easily been shared between them though. They were pretty big. My husband got the beef, cheese and bean burrito and he really liked it. He said that the beans were really flavorful! I got the chicken, potato and cheese burrito which was awesome! But when they say that their chicken is spicy, believe it! It was pretty spicy and I can usually handle spicy stuff. It was delicious though. And whatever brand of tortillas they use are so good! I must say, we also really enjoyed hearing how much fun the guys that work here were having together. They were singing along to their music and just seemed really happy to be there doing what they do. It puts out a really nice vibe. You don't see that at too many places these days. Great place, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. But with the new year comes some new changes. Their jacking up the prices and changing their hours. DONT FIX WHATS NOT BROKEN . This is the second time I've came here and the doors were locked well before the closing time. This place is seriously going downhill. So sad"}
{"text":"Today 12/23/16 at 6:50am I stopped by to pick up 2 burritos I ordered through the phone and had a bad experience at this place. I got there and paid for my burritos and the guy (in red shirt) asked me what kind of salsas I wanted and I said 5 green ones and 2 red ones. He gave me this look like if Im stupid and says: I can only give you 2 salsas per burrito but I am willing to give you 6 (out of the 7 I asked for). If you are hispanic and love eating it with a lot of salsa then this sure isn't the place for you. I had recently switched from LOS FAVORITOS to this place because is closer my house and I would get burritos twice or three times a week. Well guess what?? Back to Favo-ritos for the burritos since I have never had any problems giving me salsas after so many years of being a customer. I hope management takes care of this stupid problem."}
{"text":"Lame... we ordered food that had a side of rice, we got the food and the front register person completely ignored my husband as he took a phone order for over 5 minutes... my husband just wanted spoons for our toddlers. THEY DID NOT HAVE SPOONS! What?! What kind of restaurant doesn't have spoons? They told us to use plastic knives instead... ridiculous and the customer service is crap. We won't be coming back. You can make a burrito like they sell for pennies at home also. Go some where else."}
{"text":"Bad customer service.  On hold for a total of over 45 minutes for a large order.  Called 3 times. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I have been a faithful customer to burrito express since 2008 I love their food and I used to never have an issue with their service. Lately their service has gone completely downhill who ever they have working the counter has no phone etiquette or customer service. The delivery time takes over an hour when I am literally 4 min away. 
It's so irritating when a place you've been loving for years starts to go down the drain."}
{"text":"For a \"fast food\" type place.. This is definitely a five star. Food tastes incredibly good for such a decent price. Staff was fast, friendly and polite. All of the food is freshly made.. Come on... Total 5 stars good!!"}
{"text":"I came in on a whim for a a burrito one afternoon. I've had their breakfast burritos a lot at work and they are delicious! Especially with the green chile. I tried the steak potato and cheese for dinner and it was also pretty good. I definitely like the breakfast burritos better but I'd get this one again too."}
{"text":"Food was amazing ! Best breakfast burrito and green salsa in the valley. Can't wait till the salsa is in supermarkets. Keep the food coming!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito..potato, egg, cheese with green sauce is the best."}
{"text":"Many places make burritos however Burrito Express hits the spot much better than its competitors with its oversized and delicious burritos."}
{"text":"Just as good as the one I visit often in west Mesa.
If its your first time, try the Breakfast Burrito Supreme."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are awesome! The Supreme to be exact. Their salsa is ridiculously good. I used to be a Filibertos loyal when I wanted fast Mexican food, but this place blows it away!!! The only thing that would make it better is a drive-thru. Don't be turned off by the interior.... the food is on point. Yum!"}
