{"text":"Best noodle house in the city.

Awesome Pho, awesome staff. Check it out, we'd go there every day if we could!"}
{"text":"decent food, fast service, but there are better Vietnamese places close by, like Basil."}
{"text":"BEST Satay Beef in this town that I have found myself and those friends of mine who partake in sinful Satay Beef. 

Doesn't matter when we go, its consistent and perfect every time. From a thicker creamy peanut satay sauce to the shaved beef and noodles its just right. 

More than a dozen trips and I think what is truly the cherry on top of the pie for me, is that the 
Staff know me, my friends and if we do bring other guests, them as well next time they come through. No questions asked, there is always a table for me."}
{"text":"Late review. Incident happened 6 months ago. Owners/Servers might not even recall it. I've been eating here since 2008. Food is great and servers are always quick. Wife and I one time dropped by during lunch time and the place was surprisingly packed on a Tuesday for reasons I can't fathom. We still decided to sit and order our regular food. Unfortunately, the order took almost an hour to arrive which was really very disappointing. The food was great but  the long wait encouraged us to give no tip at all since we didn't even get any glass of water by the time we finished our food. When we paid our bill, the server warned us next time to give tip. Told her we waited an hour for our food and we didn't even get any glass of water in our table. Totally understood how busy they were, but for a frequent client like me, I felt that I was mistreated. I thought that the server's comment was rude as well. Haven't come back to this resto since the incident although we've been patronizing the other branch in Airdrie which is near our place in the NW. I feel bad writing this review but I also feel the need to warn the other patronizers of this resto. Yes the food is great but when servers forget to provide at least a minimum acceptable customer service, it stops people from coming back."}
{"text":"My old workplace used to be close by here, so we'd drop by whenever we had a hankering for Vietnamese. I like that this place is quick and easy so you can still enjoy lunch in a reasonable time.
 
I've tried noodle dishes (anything with shrimp is a definite yes), but I always go back to their pho sate. They bring you plate of fresh herbs along with your heaping bowl of soup (which I can never finish but want to!). The spice is not too overpowering and the broth is great.

Reasonable prices and convenience are also factors of why my former coworkers still continue to go here."}
{"text":"Consistent vietnamese fare with excellent lunch specials.  They rotate through various soups and bun specials for less than $10.  Each lunch special comes with an appetizer and drink.  Always fast and good."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Not bad but not my favorite.

Three stars because it took awhile for them to take our order. Maybe because they just opened either way we sat for quite a while before we got any attention."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at NK for a very long time. I have had gallons of soup here and I would argue they have some of the best (thick) sate soup in the city. The broth is thick peanuty,  with your choice of chicken, beef or and seafood, with just the right amount of spice. 

The rest of the menu is standard Vietnamese fair,  spring rolls are good,  I take the salad rolls with no pork. Delicious. 

But I come for the soup. It's awesome. It sorts me out. But beware,  it has a nasty habit of leaving splash marks on dress shirts...  Maybe it's just cause I eat like a wild animal... 

I have brought a lot of NK \"virgins\" here and the feedback is the same. Great food. Good price. Fast efficient service.

It's too bad a couple people had bad experiences here and are dragging the rating down,  it's a great spot,  give it a shot,  you will not be disappointed. 

But either arrive before noon or wait until after the lunch rush as this place is JAMMED everyday... Usually the sign of a solid restaurant - just sayin'."}
{"text":"Its still a 5 Stars to me, friendly & fast service. Good ambient, clean. Great foods & decent prices. One of my usual favorite place. They are busy most of the time. Today is Sunday in an industrial area, opens 10 am - 3 pm. It still keeping 50 % + tables full. Great!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to try this place out because I LOVE peanut sate pho. The creamier the better and they definitely delivered on that. One of the larger Vietnamese places that I have eaten at. For the most part this place was pretty good. 

However it loses 2 stars solely based on the fact that it took almost 30 minutes for our server to even take our order and another 40 minutes for it to arrive (she also forgot my boyfriends pop and my tea). This was a fairly long time to wait and one of the slower Vietnamese places. So keep that in mind. It was also VERY loud in here. Like crazy loud. Must of been the lunch rush but I could hardly have a conversation with someone sitting right across from me. Other than that, I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Best noodle soup I've ever had, and I've had a lot of noodle soup in my lifetime! Great service and good size portions too!"}
{"text":"One of if not my fav Pho in Calgary. 

Service is friendly and the food is quick. 

Portions are big and the value is incredible. Busy busy for lunch during the weekday but not so on weekends. 

I enjoy pork and spring rolls on Vermicelli noodles. 

Taste is consistent every time."}
{"text":"It took me an embarrassingly long time to like Noodle King. I come here for lunch frequently and the quality has been consistent every time. It's a hidden gem on 32nd Ave and most people who eat here actually work around the area.

If you're a regular, they'll remember your order. The staff are friendly but they don't offer super interactive service since most diners are there to eat quickly and go back to work.

What's good? Pretty much everything. The beef broth has a lot of depth, and their sate broth isn't just chili sauce with regular beef broth. It has coconut milk, and has an interesting cucumber topping. The vermicelli has never disappointed me and the portion is generous. 

If I ever stopped working in the NE, I would still go out of my way for Noodle King. Long live the Noodle King!"}
{"text":"Sate beef soup. One of the best I've ever had. Also pretty inexpensive - about $10-15 for a good portion of lunch."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant tonight since we enjoy Vietnamese food as a family.  First time trying it out.  Was very quiet.

My husband ordered #106, Chicken with Mushrooms.  Sauce was bland.  Mushrooms were out of a can (like really?).

Kids ordered #50, Charbroiled chicken, spring rolls on vermicelli.  The spring rolls were good.  The chicken tasted like shrimp (my daughters quote) and the vermicelli sticky.  Our kids typically devour this dish (in other Vietnamese restaurants) and they hardly ate it here.

I was feeling like Pho and ordered #21 Sate Chicken Noodle Soup.  They brought me Beef Noodle Soup.  So I flagged the waitress and told her.  She brought the bowl of soup to the kitchen and apologized.  Two minutes later she returned with the same bowl of soup and said you can continue eating it if you wish.  I said no and she left without the soup.  So it sat on the table.  2 minutes later she was back with a bowl of chicken that she plopped into the bowl of beef pho and said here is your chicken, its ok now?  I was truly mortified.  I wonder how John Gilchrist would have felt.  I had another 3 or 4 bites of the soup and since I really didn't enjoy the flavour all that much (the chicken was bland and did not take on the flavour of the soup) I didn't want any more.  Plus it was slightly gritty (?).

Disappointed = Yup.  I do have to say the service was very quick and our food came out steaming hot.  However each dish was disappointing enough for us that we will not return or recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The rainy day weather had me longing for comfort food, pho sure!  c'mon I couldn't resist. 

When I arrived at Noodle King, I didn't know what to expect because from the outside it looks pretty small, but the inside was a good size--with booths and tables. Perfect for dates or a family/group outings.

The food was delicious and there was a good variety. I had the deep fried won tons, spring rolls and wor won ton soup. I also did take out, and got salad rolls and taro bubble tea. So I bought half the menu for about $22.  

The prices are affordable. The portions of soup are huge! The service was really good-- I was there around 3pm, it was quiet and the staff was on their lunch break but they were still very attentive and really hospitable. 

The atmosphere is cool and down to earth, which is awesome because the Noodle King is pretty much surrounded by major restaurant franchises. I really enjoyed the \"mom and pop\" restaurant vibe. I also really enjoyed the music in the background. It was a good mix of pop and r&b-- I think I am totally the target demographic for the late afternoon pho crowd. 

I would totally go again and order take out regularly. 

Long live the Noodle King."}
{"text":"Best to come early and carpool for lunch. It gets really busy and parking is limited"}
{"text":"Since I've eaten here about 8 times, I'd say this place satisfies my hankering for noodles. You know. It happens to all of us. 

My favorites are #44 with no pork and now #26 with only shrimp. So what this means ... is that they will substitute the other stuff with more shrimp. Which is great because the shrimp here is good. Not tough, good flavor, good size and cooked well. The broth of my soup today (seafood soup, but only had shrimp) was really good. I've ordered what another yelp are described as the house special with soup on the side... That soup broth was kind of gross in my opinion. I didn't touch it. 

I didn't add anything to my soup today nor did they bring us a plate of bean sprouts, thankfully I was with someone who spoke Vietnamese and asked for some. But no mint or a red chili and Thai basil or mint .. none of that came with our soups. My lunch mate ordered the first pho on the menu - the house with everything in it - she chose egg noodles instead of rice noodles. We enjoyed both of our dishes. 

So all in all I like this place because it's quick, delicious, good attitude (snappy positive Vietnamese woman who want to make you happy) and its also a comfortable place to sit down. Nice booths and chairs you can sink into, the lighting is nice, not blaring or uncomfortable but muted, a bit dim and it's a nice busy place mostly all of the time. 

I can't decide between four and five stars, so I'll give Noodle King four, since eight out of 10 times was good."}
{"text":"Decided to try Noodle King.  Went for dinner.  We ordered:

- Spring Rolls - ingredients:  carrots, taro, onions and pork - eat spring rolls with a tangy sauce.  Wonderful starter!

- Satay Beef Noodle Soup - oh, one of the best satay beef noodle soups ever - it's the coconut-based slightly spicy red soup with crushed peanuts.  The beef was so thinly sliced and placed on in the soup, garnished with slivers of fresh cucumber and tomato.  Delicious!  

- Noodle King Special Egg Noodle Soup - shrimp, pork, squid in a clear broth.  Quite tasty!

- Cambodia Egg Noodle Soup - like Noodle King Special but also with tender pork liver - very good! 

- #118 - for Dessert especially on a hot day - mung bean, red bean, jello and coconut milk with ice chips.  

I'd definitely come back again!"}
