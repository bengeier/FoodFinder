{"text":"This is certainly a Gilbert, Arizona jewel. Exceptionally friendly staff and superior food.

The owner and her daughter are welcoming and very helpful when trying to choose from so many delightfully, delectable choices.

I have chosen the vegetarian plate, two kinds of Falafel, Dolmas, and Pistachio Baklava. 

The Baklava is the best I have had anywhere in the world including Israel. It is sweet, flaky, melt in your mouth \"honeyriffic\". 


The Falafel brought me back to Israel in a heart beat. The hummus is is also at my tops for being the best ever.

I will be back."}
{"text":"Had gyro plate and wife had gyro combo.  Food is really good and quantity is outstanding.  Service was good as well.  Would recommend to anyone interested in authentic middle eastern cafe food!"}
{"text":"Do you want to buy Goat meat?

Don't come here, they refused to serve you no matter what. I am keep buying from this place for  a year as they have nice goat meat. But the customer service sucks, they refused to choose you buy what you want. You need to take what they offer. Don't even go near to that place on friday, they refuse to serve you as they are busy with the restaurant. 

I am not the one who complains a lot, but that arrogant manner they deal with the customers and blank out response they give sucks. It looks like he is doing a favor to me by selling meat at his store."}
{"text":"Sylvia and Mohamed make eating here a delight they are always so friendly the food is on point absolutely love this restaurant"}
{"text":"The food and service were spectacular! 

Both my friend and I had Gyro salads and almond baklava. The salad had fresh veggies and an extremely flavorful greek dressing. They also did not skimp on the meat either. They was so much meat I couldn't finish it all! For dessert, the almond baklava was perfect. It was so rich and perfectly portioned. 

When we walked in, we weren't sure if it was a sit down place with servered or if you went up to the counter. In fact, I am still not quite sure. Other than this confusion, the meal was perfect. 

I will no doubt come here again and try something new. Also, if you check in while you're there, you receive 50% off your second item purchased!"}
{"text":"Alright! I am a vegetarian and all my reviews are going to be on veggie dishes. Good place to eat but not a appealing place to dine in. Falafel and hummus are my favorites here. Heard Chicken Shawarma is best among meat dishes. Baklava taste good but not great to me. Service and interiors can be more better."}
{"text":"The food was super yummy and the staff was great!!  My only negative was that there wasn't much Hummus in our entree order . Now that I know, I will definitly be ordering an extra side of it. My kids were fighting over it!!!  Great spot, we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is just ok. Over the past few years it seems like the quality of their food has gone downhill...hopefully they can turn things around, I use to love their food!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Terrible service, especially the front desk. Check your bill for overcharge."}
{"text":"We were in the area so we decided to check this place. It's a quaint family owned restaurant. We ordered a large greek salad and a combo platter good enough for 2-3  people. Everything was delicious and fresh. We hope to have room for baklava, they are also made in-house. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Ten 10 Stars!!! 
I Will Brag About This Place Totally Worth It!
LOVE The Chicken Shawarma's, The Greek Fries are to Die For! And the Baklava is Delicious Too! Gyros are Tasty Too! 
Used To Go ALL the Time! 
Now Im 3 hrs Away!:( But I Had Make the Drive! Totally Worth It!!!;)"}
{"text":"We decided to stop in here based in other reviews and we were definitely not disappointed. The food was great. The service was also great. I had the chicken kabob entr√©e and my husband and son both had burgers. We will definitely be coming back to the Phoenicia"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! They actually had a vegetarian selection of meals, which made me super happy! The owner and our waiter were both super sweet and nice! I will definitely be coming back for more Greek fries and falafel's!"}
{"text":"Stoked to have found this place. 
Friendly attentive Staff......, food is Fantastic. Made up fresh. Great flavor.
Best Hommus. It's all good. Don't forget to try the yogurt drink. 
Makes me crave the food just thinking about it 
. Great dolmades too."}
{"text":"Amazing place to get burgers and their Mediterranean stuff is pretty good as well. Classic burger, Phoenicia burger, philly steak are all we get every visit. I tried the gyro plate and that was surprisingly good too. Above all, they are very consistent and we have never been disappointed. Oh and it's all halal!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. I'm Greek nice quite the same as yia yia's food but still great"}
{"text":"The inside of the restaurant is beautifully designed with really attractive decor.  However, the food was just not good.  My husband and I are Middle Eastern, so we are very familiar with Arabic food.  My chicken shawarma was tough, the garlic sauce was sweet for some reason, and the hummus was a watery consistency and didn't taste of chickpeas at all - it had to have been diluted with oil as a cost saving measure to get that watery and tasteless.  Sorry, it was four thumbs down from us, $36 later.  :("}
{"text":"Whether you are in for the baked goods or a full meal, the Phoenicia Cafe will not disappoint. Everything I have tried there has been my new favorite thing, haha. The staff has always been kind, helpful and gracious. Due to the delicious food and excellent service, I always leave fuller and more cheerful than when I entered! Also, the samosas are to die for!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here last weekend before seeing a movie and had a great experience! 

We were greeted by one of the 2 servers, and he had a refreshing enthusiasm for his work and for the restaurant and its food. We found a seat at one of the central booth tables, and enjoyed surveying the many options. 

My husband and I each had the chicken kabob, which was very tasty. I had the hummus and salad as my sides and he had the fries and basmati rice. The hummus was good, a little on the sweet side, the salad just average. The basmati rice was nice, and the fries good but average. 

Our pitas were forgotten, then quickly brought out with a promise of a baklava on the house! We took it to go, and our daughter enjoyed it later. We will visit again!"}
{"text":"I've been to Phoenicia Cafe on several occasions and as someone who grew up in the Mediterranean area this is as good as it gets in Phoenix! 
The thing is each ME country has its OWN take on flavors and spices of common dishes- this place felt the most familiar to my upbringing! 
Everything is flavorful and garlicky just like it should be. I usually get the hommus and shish kabob sandwich. mmmmm  Tender meat bits that have been roasting on a stick on a soft pita with a ton of garlicky hommus pickles and fresh veggies.... 
I've tried most of their sandwiches and they're all great. I have not tried their dessert and service there is eh-eh depends on who you get, but really go and enjoy the food dont let all the rest distract an enjoyable meal ...
I will continually go back this is my middle eastern spot :)

Edit- I had the vegetarian falafel on my last visit! Oh my what an insult to the delicious falafel I grew up with, my grandmother would break someone's legs over how bad these are! Dry, somewhat bland- eh pass."}
{"text":"Friendly, cozy place with fantastic food. I called my order in for pick-up to whom happened to be the owner. Super friendly and I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Best Gryo's ever.   Super cool owner.  She needs her own television show on Food Network!"}
{"text":"Sylvia and the entire staff are truly awesome. We feel like family when we eat here, the portions are generous, the food is amazing. Having spent part of my teenage years in the Mediterranean, I can say with certainty the food is authentic."}
{"text":"Best ful/foul...spellings vary. Fava beans and tomatoes into a dip.  So hard to find,  but so good. Gyro meat is good.  Falafel is good.  Everything is good!  If nothing else,  go for the foul.  You'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Especially the Chicken Shwarma Pita!! Sylvia is awesome and comes around to talk with everyone, really adding to the customer service. One of my favorite mom and pop shops!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was good but this is the second time I go here and they will not allow me to use the yelp coupon. The owner is a total fill in the blank if he was a good business man he would honor the coupon. We ordered the com o which included a sandwich and still he would not let us use it! Definitely will not be recommending this place plus it would be nice if the receipts actually had prices.  There are too many good places to be aggravated by unpleasant people. If you give a coupon honor it or don't use it to try to get people in and bait and switch that's not good business!"}
{"text":"Ah yes....my old favorite! Been eating here since 2003 and I can never get bored with this food. That says something about this restaurant. Now beware that all who you will be in contact with after eating here must also eat here (the garlic factor), but hey....who wouldn't want to eat here??? (twist my arm!)

If you really want to get rid of some of the garlic breath for a little while, try the delicious baklavas....YUM!"}
{"text":"the phoenicia is a middle eastern diner.  they serve the food quickly and it's tasty and comforting.  the staff has always been courteous and friendly, the bill has always been fair.  it's location is perfect for lunch between classes or before you jump on the light rail to get out of tempe."}
{"text":"Fresh homemade pita bread daily. Inexpensive, tasty, and piled high chicken shwarma sandwich (with really good garlic sauce). Middle eastern pickles. Relatively inexpensive and fresh raw meat. Olive and feta cheese deli. All the spices you need for Indian, Middle Eastern, and Latin cooking. And a friendly staff. Great place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is tasty and if you're not full, you can get a delicious desert from the bakery. Don't be put off by the grumpy man behind the cash register because he's actually a nice guy. And the server is wonderful. He is always very cheerful and has a great sense of humor."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Staff is attentive and friendly.  Favorite east valley location for gyros"}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Everything we have ever ordered has been excellent.  Service is friendly, however, a bit slow and disjointed.  We live nearby and prefer takeout instead of \"eat-in\" because of this."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing im never been disappointed in anything. The environment is so comfortable and friendly. I truly feel like im part of their family. I highly recommend this place great quality food made with love."}
{"text":"This place was a great find when I wasn't expecting it to be. The first time I went I ordered a gyro with rice. The rice was decent and the gyro was phenomenal the tzatziki was amazing with the red onion. Then the second time I came it was still good. This is a place that holds up to being consistent with the quality of food. I will never go anywhere else for a gyro."}
{"text":"I adored my experience at Phoenicia Cafe. & I could not have asked for a more pleasant eating, dining, and service experience from this quaint place. 

I arrived at Phoenicia Cafe later in the evening, probably about an hour before they closed and it was the perfect time to come. We were seated right away, given waters, and our server was very accommodating. 

I just moved here, so I had only been to one or two restaurants specially in this kind of food, but I can never have too many options for great falafel! And boy was it delicious. They're falafel was fried just enough and the taste was rich and easy to eat: not too fried, not dry in any way, but just right. The tahini sauce was good, for I have found it can be somewhat flavorless at some places. And the vegetables look clean and they tasted delicious. The ONLY downside to this experience, was the pita. It was a little dry and not warm. If the pita had been warm and not as kind of brittle as it was, I would have been 100% pleased with my food. 

One of my friends got the vegetarian platter for which he'd never had before and scarfed it down. I watched in amazement AND he had NEVER been to this restaurant before, so I took it as solid proof that an array of their menu choices would satisfy many. 

The other plate ordered was for a carnivore who scarfed down a plate for which I unfortunately do not remember the name of. When I asked how he was enjoying his food, he said very much. He had a side of yellow basmati rice that no one else got with their order that was delicious!

Lastly, I got a piece of almond and walnut baklava that was to die for. Needless to say, it was sugary, flaky but consistent and didn't annoyingly fall apart when bit into. Needless to say, I left this little gem or a restaurant knowing I will come back soon! 

Oh, and there is a Halal (and not Halal) meat market and other middle-eastern specialty food items and few other novelties that were pretty cool."}
{"text":"This is how a family owned restaurant is suppose to be. The salads are fresh the food is delicious and not over powered by flavor. I like the staff they are very friendly and the owner greets you when you come in the door, she is such a sweet heart. I'm a vegan and usually order the Tabouli and Falafel, they taste excellent."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's tasty and affordable. My favorite  is the Vegetarian Sampler as an entree: it gives you a nice variety without overly stuffing you. The waitstaff are also friendly and knowledgable, so if you don't know what you want--ask them and they'll help you."}
{"text":"The strawberry flip is reason enough to go here but the gyro makes the trip 10 times better. The juicy (not greasy) meat, the awsome pita, and the top-notch taztziki make it a must-do spot in Mesa. This gyros are so massive I dare you to eat 2 (i wanna try try). The cashier (and I'm guessing owner) remembers my female cohorts name with every order. As long as i get my extra tzatiki I don't care :)"}
{"text":"Daughter suggested this place for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised by their food. I had the lamb cous cous, which was very tender and tasty.  The service wasn't great but the girl did her best of taking care of everything by herself. Expect some wait for a table during lunch  time."}
{"text":"I was visiting my sister and she took us there. Hands down the best Mediterranean food I had.  Best service, professional, friendly and tasty food. My little ones loved the chicken kabab, chicken wings, etc. will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"After searching the Valley for a properly made Falafel, I finally found it here....right around the corner from my house!!

The falafel plate was WONDERFUL!  Crispy on the outside and MOIST on the inside (very hard to achieve if you do not know what you are doing).  Rice was fluffy and seasoned perfect and the hummus was fresh.  Gyro meat was moist and again, properly seasoned, and man, the lamb was sooooo good!  The foul (fava beans) were AMAZING!!!!  Just a plate of those yum yums and pita bread will satisfy your appetite.  Do not skip dessert as the three different kinds of bakhlawa is just finger licking GOOD!   I love Sylvia (the owner) and her husband!  Very nice people.  You can meet most of the family in the restaurant on the weekends, which gives it a nice family feel.  

One critique....the stuffed grape leaves were NOT fresh.  I was told they were out of a can..... which broke my heart completely in two."}
{"text":"Gyro plate w/salad
Falafel plate w/fries
Baba ganoush and tiboli w/salad
Pistachio baklava
Chocolate / nut baklava

What can I say -- awesome! Food was great. Service was a little slow, but the waitress was working her tail off, so no matter.

I had the gyro plate. Lot of meat -- a lot! I'm guessing most people like it that way, which is good, but I took a few pieces off. The meat was flavored very well and pita, sauce etc tasted wonderfully together. I ate that sandwich and salad and was full all day -- well worth the $10 or so for the plate!

Regarding the salad, it was served well in a very nice dish. Looked beautiful with fresh cut greens and a yogurt sauce drizzled on top. Taste was simple and refreshing, which is a good thing when you're eating otherwise rich sandwiches.

I tried the falafel - actually I mixed in a falafel ball with my salad and it tasted great. The wife really enjoyed the baba ganoush sandwich. I've had it before and it is indeed very good.

Atmosphere is pleasant, the serving / checkout staff helpful and, most importantly, the food is excellent. Oh yeah, the baklava were sweet, rich and very tasty. I strongly recommend taking some home!!"}
{"text":"The service was horrible! I even had to get up and refill my own drink! They forgot our sons meal, brought out dipping sauce for pita's but forgot to bring the pita's and just generally never checked on us. The thing that was weird was when we first got there the place was busy but after about 20 mins of being there the big crowd left and the service got worse! It was two young girls one dark haired and one blond haired, their attitudes sucked and shouldnt be waitressing! Took forever to get our bill, I had to stare them down for it and they just seemed like they didn't care about us! The food was good but not worth anything going back for, we have had same type of food going to little hole in the wall greek places."}
{"text":"Fantastic place
the owner/waitress was very nice and helped with choosing what food I would like to eat. I am a very picky eater and was having a hard time finding what I would like because it was new food I haven't had before. 
Its a great place for family lunches or dinners, there was a great menu for kids and its a good place for even a small date. 
Very open and nice inside lots of seating. 
Food came out really fast and it was great because I didn't have a lot of time to sit and wait. 
I like that it is family owned and the recipes have been passed down through the family that makes the restaurant more unique and fun to go to because you won't find it anywhere else.
I have to admit I'm not a huge fan of Greek food so I ended up with the Chicken Kabob and it was actually really good. 
I'm planning on going back soon."}
{"text":"Mmmm...shawarma!  This is where we go when it's dad's turn to cook. If you're walking by to go to the pizza place next door, you are really missing something. Portions big enough that we usually have enough for the next day. Have tried the gyros and they are yummy but the whole family keeps coming back for the chicken shawarma. Pure comfort food!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The first time the food was good and the service was very slow. But, it was a busy night and this is one of the rare gyro places that are open on Sunday near me. 

The second time we went the food was still ok but the service was TERRIBLE. We sat at the table for almost 40 minutes before the waitress was bothered to come take our order.  Two groups sitting next to us arrived 10 minutes after our party and they ordered and got their food before the server even came back to our table to take our orders. Then She got our drink orders wrong and never fixed it. Also, all our meals  came out spaced 10 minutes apart so by the time we got the last persons order people had already had their food to 30 minutes. The servers seemed really chummy and outgoing to certain people while completely ignoring everyone else (there were tons of other angry tables and not just us). I have never left a place without leaving a tip ever, but, this experience changed that for sure.

I love family owed business but if is gets to a point where your place of business is completely chaotic and ineffective you need to rethink some things. Maybe it isn't always best to hire family and friends to be your only servers if they have no work ethic and will get away with being incompetent servers because they are family. 

Only go here if you love being treated like crap."}
{"text":"The best and most authentic shwarmas I have eaten in North America.  The menu is an assortment of the finest Arabic dishes and you can wash it down with some cold Vimto. The last time I tried Vimto was sometime in the mid 90s so, I was elated to say the least.  Phoenicia has a very popular buffet though unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to try it as of yet.  I highly recommend this place for the food and the interior decor is not bad either, with a very gratifying full wall painting of the Mediterranean."}
{"text":"Some of the best Eastern Mediterranean food I've had and I have spent a lot of time in Israel."}
{"text":"Why can't I put zero stars? My coworkers and I have been here three different times and get food to go. And every time we come, the guy at the register is as rude and condescending as can be. We are unfamiliar with this type of food, and they act so rude when we are confused about what things are. When we ask for help, we get nothing but a glare as if we were stupid. The guy (I suppose it's the owner) gets frustrated and becomes unfriendly quickly. 

I asked for a pita and hummus. The guy looked at me like as if I didn't know what I was talking about and charged me $4.32 for ONE pita and a teeny tiny little container of hummus.

We gave this place 3 difference chances and every time it gets worse. Safe to say that they just lost 3 customers that could have been regulars."}
{"text":"The food is really amazing, especially the humus sandwich and the la nutella crepes. Everyone should try it definitely"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times now, and this will be my last visit to this restaurant, which makes me sad, because that means I am still searching for a good mediterreanean restaurant in the valley.  My experience last night was appalling--and I won't go back.

It was a slow weeknight-- me and one other table.  My other two visits I stuck to the Chicken Kabob, which I liked enough to come back.  Despite the pita, which is mass produced and not the homemade yumminess I have had in other restaurants, the chicken was well prepared and tasty and the garlic dip was great.  Those are my two fav things, the rest I can ignore.  

This visit, I was talked into the buffet by the waiter.  Told me it was a great value for the money ($12.50). I got up and checked it out, and it looked interesting-- and it included soft serve pistachio ice cream.  Okay-- I agreed and got my plate.  

The food was extremely luke warm-- by the time I got it to the table, it was cold.  I know a little something about food handling safety, and this scared me.  They should be scared-- someone is going to get very sick.  I stuck to the items that were the least likely to harbor salmonella.  Honestly, the food was tasty-- I liked most of what I tasted.  I really liked the chicken gyro meat that was made into large meatballs.  Yum!  The rice was kinda crunchy-- I think it was sitting there for quite a while---and the pitas were warm, even if they were not homemade.  

When I got up to get my yummy softserve pistachio ice cream...I was told by the same waiter who talked me into the buffet that they didn't have the ice cream today, but I could buy another dessert for $2.00 more.  SAY WHAT?  

I thought he was joking at first.  Um, No.  I asked him why in the world would he talked me into the buffet if they didnt have all the included items?  He said he didnt think it was a big deal.  I asked to speak to a manager, and he said that he was the manager \"on that night\"    Eventually, after more arguing and displeasure, he brought me a small piece of baklava to \"try to make me happy\"  

What has happened to customer service these days?  I did find it ironic that when I paid my bill, they had a sign asking you to send a message to the Food Network to get them to come film.  If you forwarded the message to them, they will give you a free piece of baklava!   

The food ordered off the memo is pretty tasty, but if you go, stay away from the buffett.  And don't expect the management to take care of you-- you're on your own here."}
{"text":"By far one of the most authentic and best Middle Eastern restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. I've eaten here probably 10 times and I've brought quite a few friends with me and everyone always loves this place. No it's not fancy, but the food is delicious and the waitstaff and owner are super nice! 
Can't recommend enough!"}
{"text":"This place is next to a mosque.....of course it is going to be good. 

The hummus is the best in the valley IMO. The gyros are excellent, the chicken is excellent, the falafel is excellent, the greek fries are excellent, I really can't think of anything I don't like there. The experience is always great!"}
{"text":"This location is closer to me and it's way better than the Tempe location. I always order the Phoenicia burger with Greek fries and it's one of the best under $10 burgers. Customer service is good except for they usually forget to refill your drink which then you have to go refill it, honestly I think it would be better if they didn't have any waiters that would make a lot more sense for this Restuarant."}
{"text":"This was my first and last time eating at this restaurant.  The customer service that we received was disgraceful.  They had signs posted all over the restaurant that kids eat free from 3-8pm.  We ordered two entrees and a kids meal for our daughter.  We were charged for the kids meal and I pointed out their advertisement.  They said that those signs were new today and that that special does not start until October 15th.  I looked at the sign again and it was not mentioned anywhere that it started on the 15th.  The young gal at the counter brought someone else out (owner?  manager?  not sure) and I asked him to honor their advertisement.  He said \"No, that special starts on October 15th and that they have a big banner on the outside of their window that states that.\"  I went outside to look at the banner and this is what it said.  \"Ameri-Greek Breakfast-Buffet October 15th.\"  Can you tell me how that tells me that their kids eat free starts on October 15th?

 I am extremely disappointed that they would not honor what they were advertising, but more important than that, they did not seem to have a care about  their customers.

I also ordered a smoothie and asked if I could have it ahead of the meal, the gal said sure, no problem.  It did not come until after our meal was delivered to our table.  I would not recommend the strawberry banana smoothie, it was very watered down."}
{"text":"The hummus & baklava here are incredible but the gyro was pretty bad. I love coming here just for the hummus and at least it's reasonably priced. I prefer the Mediterranean market/restaurants that we have here in AZ, but unfortunately I live a little far so I decided to try this place. I wouldn't discourage anyone from going though because there's a chance their other food is good. My boyfriend loved the falafel."}
{"text":"Im a college student at ASU and I go to this place all the time! Im a muslim so I also go to the mosque near by which is subsequently how I ended up finding the place to being with. Anyway, I usually get the lamb gyro and it is delicious! The way they cook their meat makes it so soft and juicy giving it this amazing texture that just leaves you wanting more. Ive had their Wings, Pizza, Samosa's as well and it was all very good in my opinion. The staff is great as well, Ive gotten to know one of the \"waiters\" there and he's a really nice guy who really tries his best to make your experience there as positive as possible. It can get a bit pricey though and that may come as a surprise to many of you. Not so much of surprise for me, most south asian, middle eastern, and Mediterranean cuisine restaurants tend to be pricey in the US. Overall, excellent food, very good portion, excellent staff, and definitely a restaurant that I go to quite often for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"All I wanted was a good falafel sandwich and all I paid for was gross dry falafel soggy tomatoes, withered lettuce!!! This is unacceptable Phoenicia! :("}
{"text":"Good food.
Not the best service. 
We always stop here when we visit the Tempe Masjid."}
{"text":"I will be going here again. Their hummus was fresh and tasted great. My gyro was delicious and was made with thicker cuts of lamb. Service was quick and I really enjoyed the place."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Shawarma and Gyro meat were on point. Hummus was a little bland, will try the cilantro or red pepper next time."}
{"text":"The best greek fries and gyro this side of Chicago! Owners/staff make it even better!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Love Sylvia and the homey feel of this restaurant. Delicious food. Happy to bring my kids for healthy meal."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious: gyros, rice, dolmades, french fries, salad, smoothies. The waitstaff were very attentive and friendly. And the portions were huge!"}
{"text":"First time eating here last night. Food was very good got the big combo plate. They were busy and the service was a bit slow but they made up for that with how friendly and nice everyone was. Will def be back."}
{"text":"Orders weren't correct and there was hair in the food. Service...would be able to rate it if we actually had any. Isn't the worst food I've ever had by any means but we weren't sure what all the hype was about."}
{"text":"Very oily food, half burnt kabobs. Poor management. Wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!!!  If you live or work in this area and are not eating here your making a monumental mistake. The woman who works here recommended the gyro. Best gyro I've had in a long while. Rice, light and fluffy goodness. You can feel the love and care in every bite.   If we let this great local place disappear it would be a crime against humanity. Drive past all the Friday McFunbags chain eateries and eat lunch here!"}
{"text":"Great quality food and a nice, relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just got their gyro combo and their hommus. Gyro was HUGE, meat was decent...had a couple pretty dry pieces but overall good. Hommus was different, but very good. Personally I'm excited to try out more of the menu, I could see myself grabbing a bite to eat once or twice a month here."}
{"text":"the food is awesome here.  falafel appetizer, Shawarma salad is our favorite and the service great as well. Yesmine remembered our order when we arrived.  great job Phoenicia- we are hooked and will be there at least once a week."}
{"text":"I tried their daily special sujuk on pita with Greek fries. All I have to say i'm definitely coming back again. The food was great and at a great price. Their daily specials are perfect for my taste!

Service is definitely a hit or miss. My waitor was great and he was glad to answer my questions. They have flat screen TVs for your viewing pleasure. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was hands down AMAZING. I tried the kibbe and had the chicken shawarma. The chicken was seasoned to perfection and the server was very attentive. Also try the homemade lemonade made with rose water. Best part about the entire meal was the price."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Phoenicia since we moved from the Bay Area ten years ago. The food is amazing, and the owner and staff are so friendly!"}
{"text":"Me and my daughter had such a great experience for our first time! As soon as we walked in the owner Silvia greeted us with such good manners. Then Ryan took our order and he was absolutely amazing. His customer service was spot on! The food was really great!!"}
{"text":"Everything here is good. My favorites are the gyros and the hommos.

My dad and his girlfriend share a chicken shwarma salad and that's quite a bit of food, also a good glutin free option.

The staff are very nice and attentive, family owned.

Save room for dessert; they have a variety of baklava and they all taste good.

They also have a small grocery shop inside with some good spices."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I felt writing a review was warranted! The Hummus, Fattoush and Baklava are delicious.  They were extremely friendly when I ordered my food to go as well as picking up. I will be back again not only because my food was fresh and fantastic but that Walnut Baklava is to DIE for! Yum!!"}
{"text":"I suggest this place to everyone, but, if you've move to phoenix from somewhere known for middle eastern food (Michigan namely) and used to good authentic middle eastern food. This is the place.  I searched for two years and wouldn't go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time. The food is great. Better than Pita jungle. The hummus and baba ghanoosh (sp.) is the best I have had in the valley. The restaurant is fairly small though (not conducive to a large party)."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Gyro was legit. Meat was moist and they gave huge portions. Definitely plan on coming back. Great place to go to get your Mediterranean fix!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place. I suggest the chicken schwarma and a side of Greek Fries."}
{"text":"Sorry fellow Yelpers, but I went yesterday and I just did not experience what you all did.  The atmosphere was a quaint little locally owned place with a bakery/grocery attached and lively music which I loved-GREAT change of place from all the corporate and bland white bread places in the Valley.
The food however....ehhhhh...not so much.
I consider myself and afficando of Greek/Mediterranean/Persian food and have been on the hunt since moving to Phoenix from Chicago and we pretty dissapointed eating here.  Nothing was bad...but nothing was great either.  The Masa we ordered lacked flavor as the cheese was mozzerella and the olives just black, not even kalamata or anything.  The fattoush deluxe was heavy on the chicken and light on the salad (great for the big meat eaters out there) but it was simply too much chicken that was just average and a bit dry.  The fattoush was dressed in a homemade dressing that would have been very good had they not doused the salad in it-way to heavy handed for what is supposed to be a light/refereshing salad.
The greek fries were disappointing to say the least....frozen fries straight out of the bag and into the deep fryer.  True greek fries should be handcut and a bit thicker to hold onto their feta counterpart- they also tasted a bit bland as they lacked any oregano.
The chicken kabob pita was also \"just there\" nothing to send back to the kitchen but certainly nothing to come back for.

I was let down Yelpers, send me some place where the guy in the kitchen is called Dimitri, Costantinos or George, not Manuel."}
{"text":"For good medi-middle eastern food this place is better than most in the East Valley. The food platters are sizable for the cost, and service is great. Probably the best chicken shwarma I've tasted in Arizona."}
{"text":"What a tasty great treasure in downtown Tempe. Went with friends before ASU Football game. The waitress was outstandinf. Restaurant was busy and she was the only server. She maintained great service and she was prompt with tefills. Two of us had the gyros comvo. Sandwiches he's were huge. Another friend had the shrimp kabob plate and another friend had the chicken plate. Portions were huge and quiet tasty. Leave room for their baklava. We shared the pistachio and the almond/hazelnut baklava. You could taste the home made flavors. Think they might even make their own pita bread. Connected to the restaurant is a unique Mediterranean market and bakery."}
{"text":"Ordered the Buffet, the food was cold, I told the waiter never got back with me. Upon check out, one of the waitresses asked me how was everything, I told her the food was cold in the buffet, she started making excuses, never said sorry and never offered to not charge for the meal. Poor customer service and frankly hazardous food that is sitting in the buffet for god knows how long."}
{"text":"The Phoenicia Grill offers a mean Gyro sandwich that won't leave you disappointed and asking, \"Where's the Beef?\". The Chicken Shawarma (shawarma combo-yum!) is flavorful and my daughter loves it. Garlic sauce is the Best on pretty much everything. Wonderful Hummus and rice. A place where meat lovers and vegans can unite with a great menu and friendly staff that makes every visit a enjoyable! I Love Phoenicia Grill!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a gyro! I was amazed with how much meat came in the gyro for an awesome price! Very flavorful and not dried out. I would suggest asking for extra sauce to compensate for all that meat. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Phoenicia cafe has the best gyro plates ever! Served with garlic sauce, rice, hommus, and salad. Do yourself a favor and try it as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"We were dying for Mediterranean food after a long day visiting TX Ranger training camp, saw the reviews and thought we would try. This is a casual dining experience, on the edge of the ASU campus, but do not let this small, niche place deceive you! Our waitress, Hayatt (pronounced like the hotel), was one of the nicest and most welcoming waitresses we've ever had. She treats you like an old friend and does her job with a simple joy that is so refreshing! I had a combo (gyro/chicken shawarma) and the hubs had the rack of lamb. Both were excellent. The garlic sauce is aaaaaaghmazing! We had sides of hummus, French fries and basmati rice, which were all tasty. Be sure to save room for some baklava for dessert!!! They have about five/six different kinds. Ummmm good!!! We'll definitely come back next time we're in town, not just to eat Mediterranean, but to see our beautiful soul of a friend, Hayatt!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent!!  They do to-go and sit down and both are good.  They have some of the best pita I have ever had.  My favorite thing here was the lebneh and they have taken it away.  I would eat here more often if they would bring the lebneh back.  The staff here is very nice and make you feel like family."}
{"text":"BOOO!!! Used to be a BIG FAN...In fact, The Phoenicia Cafe was on a list of merely four restaurants we would consider patronizing.  Recently, things turned dreadfully worse when we brought our family from out of state for their first visit.  We were embarassed to say the least, after hyping up this place to no end.

The waitress, although sweet, was easily confused, could not handle our order (4 adults and 3 kids).  She went all over the table, then forgetting to take one order altogether. Then when the food STARTED to arrive, the delays in between each of our dishes were absurd.  One or two plates came out, then ten minutes later someone else's meal arrived and it continued until finally 25 minutes later, we all got our meals.   To make things worse, one of us ordered a Phoenicia Philly Steak - came out with almost no meat! REALLY?? $8!!  Then, to add insult to injury a kids' meal macaroni and cheese came out as a GIANT bowl of what appeared to be, mediocre at best, KRAFT MAC AND CHEESE - dry and just inedible for $4.

To make things even more embarassing, the owner was there when this all transpired and she either ignored that the waitress was completely over her head and that the kitchen staff was so disorganized, or she just simply did not even care.  Real shame, such a nice lady!

So, our list of places to dine has diminished and the Phoenicia is on that list no longer.  Save your money and save the trip."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Highly recommended if you're in the area! The chicken shawarma and Turkish coffee were spot on! Very authentic and extremely nice and helpful staff!"}
{"text":"I go here with my family whenever we are in the area.  One of our many favorites is their hummus deluxe with saut√©ed lamb.  My grandson cannot get enough of their saffron rice.  Great casual family dinner place and their staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I normally do not eat Greek or Middle Eastern food.  Having a business meeting at Phoenicia Cafe gave me snow opportunity to taste it.  I was very impressed with all aspects of the experience.  The food was great."}
{"text":"We ate at Phoenicia Cafe on Sunday, Jan. 29, in transit from Maui back home to RI. 
Our waiter, Hakim, was wonderful. Service was excellent and very welcoming.  The food--gyros, baba ganouj and tabouli boat, vegetarian appetizer plate were flavorful and fresh.  After dinner, we enjoyed coffee and baklava on the sunny patio. The selection of baklava is impressive. A perfect ending for our vacation."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Mediterranean food and this place does not disappoint. Ordered the Gyro plate and Phoenicia combo....awesome!

Good sized portions and prices are about right. The staff is also very welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered 2 gyro sandwiches, 1 fries with 4 small ketchup, and 2 glasses of water. My friend was paying, and the Mid-Eastern guy (in his late 50s/60s) at the cashier charged us $17.50. There was no total amount of the tab. The tab just contained the quantity of the order (2 gyro sandwiches, 1 fries, 4 ketchup, and 2 water).

In the second time we went to Phoenicia Cafe, my friend and I ordered the same thing (2 gyros, 1 fries with 4 small ketchup, and 2 glasses of water). I was paying, and the Mid-Eastern guy at the cashier charged us $18.50. The tab didn't have the total price; it just contained the quantity of the order. My friend and I were surprised and gave the cashier the benefit of the doubt. Maybe the price had changed and the cashier, who is also the owner/manager of Phoenicia Cafe, forgot to tell the waitress about the price change. The owner probably started charging customers for the ketchup.

The third time my friend and I went there, we ordered the same order (2 gyro sandwiches, 1 fries with 4 small ketchup, and 2 glasses of water). My friend was paying, and the owner/manager charged us $17.50. So, we asked him if there was price change or a charge for the ketchup. The owner/manager said the ketchup was free and there was no price change of the menu.

My friend and I are now skeptical of the tab without the amount of each food item and the total price of the order. We are also skeptical of the owner's/manager's Math calculation. So, my friend and I have stopped going to Phoenicia Cafe. We are not happy how the owner/manager runs Phoenicia cafe and does Math calculations of the order!

To all prospect customers of Phoenicia cafe, take a photo of the menu, count your order, and DO the Math calculation accurately yourself so you don't get overcharged! Do NOT rely on the Math calculation of the cashier, who is also the owner/manager of Phoenicia Cafe!"}
{"text":"Owners are not friendly at all. the food is ok but haji babas is much better and the prices are MUCH better. The Phoenicia is way too overpriced just for the convenience of being close to asu. ridiculous"}
{"text":"I was very hesitant to try this place as my grandparents are actually Greek and restaurants disappoint me. The chicken gyro was delicious and worth the price, but the Greek fries were bitter, soggy, and awful! I recommend getting regular french fries, which is a shame since feta cheese is delicious and paired nicely with fries. It's not with it to eat the sauce unless you REALLY like soggy fries. 

Service was fine, they hire collage students or high schoolers, i couldn't tell but they were certainly young. It was understandable that my waitress wasn't attentive, because it was a busy time of lunch. However, if the service is always like that, I wouldn't recommend this place. Food is worth the trip though."}
{"text":"Superb gyro meat for starts. The Baba Ganoush is the best I have ever had. You can taste the charcoal smoke flavor in every bite.

The service is fast and the owner is highly involved with the customers. I'm not sure about the way they handle the tickets as you never get to see what you were charged on your bill."}
{"text":"I tried Phoenicia Cafe for the first time yesterday after hearing it get super hyped up by one of my co-workers and then checking yelp for verification. I do not agree this is the best food nor is it the best Mediterranean food. 

I tried the falafel and hummus pita boat. It was a giant piece of pita bread stuffed with some fairly dry falafel, shredded iceberg lettuce and a couple of tomato slices tossed in. The hummus saved it - it was quite good, very creamy and garlicky. I asked for Greek fries since everyone says they're phenomenal but I was served regular fries. I realize our server was very busy (only server during lunch) but she never checked back so I could ask about it.

The chocolate baklava was also tasty; it is chocolate and hazelnut and had a lovely layer of just enough honey on the bottom. 

Overall it was decent for the price but it certainly did not blow me away and the service was just okay. Maybe my expectations were too high? I would give the place another chance and try something else."}
{"text":"One day, as my friend Darius and I were trying to kill some time before going to class we came here for lunch. This was Darius' first time with Mediterranian cuisine and after reading all the glowing reviews for here - I knew this was the place to take him! :)

We had some hummus as an appetizer, and oh em gee!! it was so great! I couldn't believe it was so creamy and perfectly garlicly!! Normally hummus is a lil too strong for me but this was great.

I had the Gyro plate and it was a LOT of food! I enjoyed it very much, I just wish it came with more pita bread. Gyro meat was plated with some more hummus, basmati rice and fixins for awesome gyros. My friend had this dish with garbanzo beans and lamb. He really enjoyed it and said it the meat was tender. I didn't try it but it sure looked good. :)

We closed our meal with some blaklavah - they have different varieties of the mediterranian staple, I had the walnut backlavah and he had the pistashio. I liked it but I've had better and it was WAY too sweet, I couldn't finish it! 

Over all, this is one of the best places I've discovered since moving to Tempe. I really enjoy it and look forward to finding more places! To my yelpers, I say: GO! The food is yummy, the decor is cute and clean, the service is more than decent and the location is mill but NOT mill.. gotta love it!"}
{"text":"Family owned and run, we simply love this place.  Mom and daughter run Gilbert location and are awesome.  Great atmosphere for family.   

Food is wonderful.  We eat in or take out and it has NEVER disappointed.  We have tried the kabob, shwarma, and kafta plates mostly.  Hummus is solid as well. You cannot go wrong here.  One of our all time favorites."}
{"text":"We went tonight for the first time, and I have found my new favorite restaurant in the world! The food is fresh, hot and so tasty! The servers are all super-friendly and fast. The portion size was huge, and you get complimentary soup with your meal.  I loved the variety of sauces they offered with our meal--tahini, garlic paste and tzatziki. The pita was warm and soft, and the hummus was perfect.  I got the kafta and the kebap combo which also came with salad, rice, hummus and pita bread with sauces. I was so full, but I couldnt resist one of their 4 varieties of baklava--so tasty and a great price. (it was a little dry--I'd like to see it with a little more honey sauce, but it was still very good and fresh tasting--definitely not frozen) .   We just moved here from the midwest, where getting good mediterranian food was next to impossible. I am so happy to have this affordable gem so close to my new home! :) We will be back!!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"We were 8 people who tried this place for lunch. As soon as we entered we got 3 tables put together but all the tables were sticky and felt like they haven't been cleaned. The chicken tasted very dry, the lamb and beef were pathetic....among the 8 of us, 4 got sick by evening. All had indigestion. I got the worst with with indigestion and headache lasting all night. The staff was friendly though and that's the reason for one star, if not I would have given them zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food. We had the chicken shawarma, gyro, and red pepper hummus. All very good and large portions. The staff is great, very attentive and personable. I would recommend to anyone who likes good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"I love the Vegetarian sampler. I haven't been able to find proper Middle Eastern food since I left my home town of Detroit. I love the food here. Sylvia is so sweet, she makes you feel like you're at home. I'm glad I found a little piece of my hometown in Gilbert!!! I'll be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat at Phoenicia Grill at least twice a month. If it were not for the fact we live in Fountain Hills, we would choose to eat here more often. First of all, as we walk in the door you are always greeted by the friendly owner. She never forgets your face and always lets you know how much she appreciates your business and that you enjoy her food. The meals are consistently fresh and delicious. The food presentation is picture perfect. We love their chicken shawarma, tabouleh, hummus and our favorite, garlic sauce. Make sure you order the Greek Fries, they will knock your socks off! Out of this world fries!! You have to try this cute little place. I know you will enjoy it as much as we do."}
{"text":"Our first visit of what we plan to be many. We had a delightful meal (be sure to have some baklava!), and the staff was awesome."}
{"text":"Their Gyros ARE THE BOMB !!! Fantastic Flavor and presentation !!! Well Gone !!! This is one of our FAVES in all of Gilbert !!! The trendy \"snob shops\" on Gilbert Road between Elliot & Guadalupe can't hold a Candle to this place - AWESOME VALUE for your Dollar !!!!"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant by accident, but were pleasantly surprised by the great food and realistic prices. I ordered the euro combo and never had so much meat on the euro before. My wife had a chicken euro combo and enjoyed hers as well. I would definitely recommend them for lunch, and would try them for supper next time."}
{"text":"I always have the vegetarian platter, which is excellent. I'm not really a fan of falafel, but theirs is crunchy, flavorful and not greasy at all. The tabouli and baba ganoush are equally good, and the kitchen is happy to replace my hummus with a serving of labneh. The only downside is the pita, it's definitely not fresh baked, and tastes packaged and flavorless. The last time I ate at the Phoenicia Cafe, I tried their pistachio baklava, which is easily the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is an excellent Middle Eastern restaurant in Tempe.  The food is always consistent and made with fresh ingredients.  For those interested, there is a Middle Eastern grocery located right next to it.  Both the falafel and hummus are very tasty, and I have enjoyed their chicken shwarma pita sandwich, too.  They also have very good baklava.  My favorite dish, however, is the chicken ghallaba entree, which consists of strips of chicken with vegetables and rice in what I believe is a spicy tomato-based sauce.  The entrees come in generous portions, so come with an appetite or be prepared to take leftovers home.  This restaurant is within walking distance from ASU, which means that it gets really busy during the lunch hour.  Be sure to get there early if you want lunch, in order to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"Our food came out quickly and was amazing. The service was a little slow in bringing us out check but overall would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Overlooking the mediterranean sea, Phoenicia lies in the quaint Phoenix suburb of Gilbert, Arizona. As a native of this city, I have craved good/any Mediterranean or Middle Eastern food for over 10 years! With a great location at the civic center, I was drawn to this location when driving by it multiple times as I did not dare to challenge the Arizona heat on a blistering summer day.

Entering Phoenicia a few months ago for the first time, I was hesitant due to my unfamiliarity with the restaurant. Since that point, I can honestly say simply amazing. This evening I had the Shish Kafta with Tabouleh and fries. The kafta was seared to perfection with the accompanying Tahini sauce. Coming from a person who normally does not rave about salads, I LOVED the Tabouleh! The parsley, tomato and vinaigrette combination was a refreshing burst of flavor!

We also ordered the rack of lamb meal. As a connoisseur of lamb, this was just amazing!! Soft and well-done, I became an instant fan of this delicacy! While the food was great, who can forget the guava juice. The juice was just an awesome sweet beverage for this tasty meal. 

In terms of service, I was extremely impressed. The waiters were very accommodating and consistently checking in on the quality of our dining experience. I must say the service was as good as the food with the exuberant staff on hand!

Next time, I intend to expand my horizons and look to try their Baba Ghanouj or baklava. I'm sure that if their other menu options were as excellent as my meal, I will soon become a regular of this fine establishment!

Food: 5/5

Service: 5/5

Atmosphere: 5/5"}
{"text":"The best in the valley.  If you want excellent food, ambiance, and the best service, look no further.  My new standby"}
{"text":"This business is definitely worth checking out for sure.  First thing that stood out to me is the extremely friendly, attentive, and outgoing staff.  The entire atmosphere from the beautiful murals on the wall to the smiles of the servers faces are only overshadowed by the delicious food and even more delicious prices.  Holy moly do you get a lot of food for your buck.  I'm not even going to discuss the individual foods we have ordered, have gone a couple times now.  Do yourself a favor and order the hommus.  Ridiculous amounts of hommus and extremely fresh delicious pita.  All food tastes fresh and comes out smoking hot.  Never ran out of my drink and every question, every need was addressed promptly and professionally.  Will be a lifelong customer.  Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Don't bother with this joint. They brag about their lamb, which I ordered from menu.
Then they said it was beef.  Nothing against beef, but I was really looking fwd to lamb.
Owner/mgr confirmed it was beef, even though menu said lamb----I walked, never go again
since it was 20 minute drive for special food."}
{"text":"Went in to get some Shawerma and was not disappointed. Probably the best Shawerma in town....and I know Shawerma"}
{"text":"I give Phoenicia 3 stars for the warning when I walked in at 6:40. 

\"We close at 7.\"

Um, ok. Does that mean I should turn around and walk out? Does it mean I get my food in 15 minutes and be expected to inhale it in 3 and then pay in the other two? Or do I get it to go? 

In any case, it wasn't the owner saying this. It was a college kid, probably more interested in the finer aspects of life, like playing some serious PS3 or watching Family Guy reruns. It was hot outside and I wasn't all that motivated to try and think of where else nearby to eat (it wasn't going to be PF Chang's, I can tell you that much). 

\"I'll get a chicken kebab plate with rice & hummus to go, then.\"

In the interim, I got to survey the inside. Some random Arabic Islamic calligraphy here and there, interspersed with bright splashes of Suns colors on the walls, Suns pennants, and countless photographs of loyal patrons all over by the register. There seemed to be pleasant enough seating outside, too - although I don't know if they have water misters for the summer heat or not. 

I eventually got my food and brought it home. Two grilled spears of chicken kebabs, ample rice and hummus, two pitas, and a little container of, WOAH! THAT'S GARLIC! sauce.

The food was good, although the chicken was a little on the dryer side. Can't really remark on the service as I ate at home, but the owner, who was tending shop in the adjoining Salam Market, was friendly.

So all in all, decent enough Middle Eastern place. Not the best I've had here but nothing stuck out as being bad either. I'll come back again and try some other dishes sometime down the road, but I'll be sure to give myself more than 20 minutes leeway next time around."}
{"text":"The food is great and the owner is sweet and easy to talk to. I havealways had great service and it feels like you are family."}
{"text":"Awesome buffet. Excellent Greek food. The owners could not be nicer. Really make you feel at home. Waiters were prompt. I've been there probably a dozen times over the past year. I've never had a bad meal yet! My only problem is that the food is so wonderful....by the time I walk out the door I have eaten WAY TOO MUCH!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! My wife and I have had multiple dishes and all have been great. Customer service is always on point. The owner is always making time to ensure everything is fine."}
{"text":"The wife and I blindly stumbled in for a quick bite before a movie.  The food was very good.  I took a chance on the lamb Ghallaba and loved it.  Humus and baba ganoush were very tasty.  My wife loved here vegi sampler.  

The place was about half full with one waiter who was working his hardest to keep up but it would have been nice if they had enough help to fully accomodate everyone.

Prices are reasonable.

Really wish they had beer.  Regardless, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered two combination plates from here. My dad only eats halal meat so it narrowed my choices of restaurants down and led me to Phoenicia. It was my first visit. Their hummus was really good, so were their fries, nice and fresh. Good garlic aioli sauce as well. We also enjoyed the rice. The meat however wasn't too great. I'm middle eastern so I am a hard judge. I have experienced so much better tasting meats. Overall, I would be back if someone insisted on dining here. I may go back and try their hamburgers to give them another chance at winning me over. Right now I am not too impressed. But I must point out the gentleman taking my order was very nice. Superb customer service skills. Whoever hired him was an outstanding judge of character. 5 stars for customer service"}
{"text":"We've only tried Phonecia once, but we'll definitely be back. We love love loved the cilantro hummus. The waiter challenged us to think of a better hummus, and we were stumped. I had the falafel and rice (both a little unimaginative but reliably good), and my husband had the gyro (huge and tasty). Service was great even though they were super busy. We'd recommend it as one of the only Greek places in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were feeling pretty indecisive about dinner but this hit the spot! Flavor, flavor, flavor! Great selection just don't be afraid to experiment. I'm not an expert on Mediterranean food but I do know good food and this was it. Lamb, beef, chicken... it was all good! The only thing I wasn't crazy about were the pitas. Kind of funny like that but I'm not complaining because I left feeling full. Great service. Clean restaurant. Perfect location. Only two things I can think of that would make it... that much more perfect. Wine. Better pita bread. Don't change anything else. Even without those we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Went for the first time based on the reviews.  It was lunch time on a weekday, but maybe only a quarter full.  I ordered to go and I waited over 30 minutes (actually checked my phone in disbelief) to get my order.  Food was pretty good, but with a wait like that I'll never be back."}
{"text":"It was great. Eaten here twice both times I was pleased. I got a gyro the first go around and it was loaded with meat !!! Yum"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and ordered the chicken shwarma plate for only 5 dollars and some change. The chicken was great , not dry at all. The hummus and garlic sauce was really good too. I actually ended up buying some hummus and pitas to take home. The staff told me they have an all you can eat lunch buffet  Friday-Sunday for $8.99. I will be back to try it. They should get a liquor license...

P.S. make sure your significant other eats the same thing. The breath/burps you get are killer! :)"}
{"text":"Great Gyros.  Fast & Friendly service.  Mini-mart & desserts attached to cafe."}
{"text":"I asked for a half lemon 3 times and was brought a bucket of lemons that were sitting out in front counter since we arrived. I had a glass of water and it was never refilled the whole time I was there. IF I CANT GET WHAT I WANT, I WOULD RATHER NOT EAT, AND I DIDNT. THE FOOD WAS COLD AND WE DIDNT EAT IT AND GOT AN ATTITUDE FROM SERVER. I would rather not go there again and I won't. This place used to be excellent but since the owners are not there anymore, the place went to hell. Went to pay the bill and was charged an additional 3.5% for paying with a debit card. Are you kidding me? What a RIPOFF! Now for sure I never go back"}
{"text":"This place kicks ass. Kudos for the buffet and various assortments in baklava!  Perfectly cooked gyro meat, however their hummus is typically overblended to the point of pure cream. BUT that didn't kill my appetite or anything. Great value for the $$, they are very generous with portion size. I love this place. And it's not overly popular (read: crowded) as other places. I would totally recommend this for lunch hour, a quick takeout for movie night, or dinner. I am looking forward to my next visit here."}
{"text":"Big fan, great food and wonderful staff.  Sylvia is always so welcoming I feel like I am coming home.  Love all the meats - and their hummus is the best. The baklava is to die for - made fresh daily and several varieties.  Great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I've been patronizing Phoenicia Cafe for years.  Even having moved out to Mesa, I will stop by on the way home from work in Phoenix to pick up dinner.  The food is excellent and very reasonably priced.  The owners and employees are friendly and always inquire about how things are going in my life.  Though I usually get takeout, on the occasions when I've eaten in, I've received great service and never had to wait for a table.  The one drawback is parking.  Since Phoenicia Cafe is located in Downtown Tempe by ASU, parking can be a hassle during peak times."}
{"text":"Best mediterranean food EVER! 

I used to live across the street on Forest Avenue and I never ate here. I had no idea what I was missing. Now that I live 20 mlies away I make the treck to Tempe for this delicious food. 

Best. Food. Ever. 

Seriously."}
{"text":"Everything you want a Mediterranean place to look like! The staff is very inviting and friendly. The women who runs the place was super sweet and gave me some extra sides at no charge. The food is great. I've had hummus and gyro sandwiches. Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Wow. Family owned. Everything made fresh and it taste like it. I ate way too much. Great great quality food. Super friendly staff. We are the buffet. A little expensive but worth it because of the quality."}
{"text":"I like Greek food almost as much as Italian food. I get very emotional about a great gyro or mousaka. It had been awhile since we tried this restaurant and we decided to give it another swing. Surprisingly we were greeted when we came in the door by the staff and the management. We were seated immediately (used to be you paid first at the register and then you sat down wherever you could find a seat). Our drinks were brought out to our table and we were then allowed to hit the buffet bar. This buffet had about twenty items on it. The gyro meat was fresh and good. The pita bread was awesome. The hummus was delicate and very good. By far the brightest stars on the bar were the cabbage rolls. The wife and I couldn't get enough of them. The service was excellent. The food was phenomenal. The ambiance was very good considering this is a strip mall location. If you love Greek food but don't want to break the bank then this place is a very good choice! I give it five stars and two thumbs up.The buffet by the way, is only on Friday through Sunday at lunch. The rest of the week it is menu driven. They also have a breakfast buffet but haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food hands down! Family environment with a taste of the Mediterranean."}
{"text":"The family environment mixed with the amazing food makes this a place where you not only want to fill up your stomach but spend quality time! 

Best Mediterranean food in town!"}
{"text":"They beat gyros in town, chicken shawarma was awesome, I order it at least once a week. Always fresh and hot. I love this place it's always a go to. Thanks you all at the gilbert location keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in the valley without question! We've been going to their Gilbert location regularly for the past year, but recently moved to central Phoenix and were delighted to find the original location is close by in Tempe. I got take out for my parents while they were in town and they were blown away by the quality, flavor and care that was put into each dish. 

We love their thick cut crispy Gyro meat, and their hummus is just heavenly. Their Fettoush is another favorite, so light and lemony. Everything I have tried has been amazing, and I can't wait for another chance try it again!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Greek food I've had since I was in \"Greek town\" in Toronto!

My brother in law and I picked up some take out from here about 2 weeks ago and man, we love this place now! 

The wait staff is amazing, so friendly and definitely seem like they love working there, which is always great to see. 

I ordered the lamb and chicken shawarma combo with hummus and tabbouleh, and a chicken shawarma wrap for my wife. 

The lamb was TO DIE FOR! The biggest, thickest slices I have ever had, and it was so crispy on the outside while still moist and delicious on the inside! 
The chicken on both meals was a little on the dry side but still really flavorful and definitely tasted like good shawarma. 

But what really made the meal was the hummus...seriously I could bathe in that hummus, it was that good. It was the creamiest, most delicious hummus I've ever had and definitely tasted like they had made it on site, fresh! 

Even the Baklava was amazing! 

Seriously, if you love Greek food, PLEASE eat here, you will be in heaven!"}
{"text":"Im actually pretty impressed with this place. I didnt feel like driving down to my usual spot and this was a bit cheaper. one of the better chicken kabobs iv ever had. Juicy, tender,  and seasoned really well. I also ordered a fatoush salad. Its a big portion...a little too much dressing,  but good. Since I checked in on yelp I got a free sandwich as well. Theres a small middle eastern market attached with zam zam, falafel, etc... overall,  I really enjoyed my food and will be back again."}
{"text":"I have probably ate at the Phoenician at least 100 times. As a student at ASU I spent many afternoons on thier patio. Unfortunately over the years the food has declined as prices increased. If it wasn't for the waiters and my hope to taste the deliciousness I recall from years ago (and the baklava) I would never go back. I remain hopeful..."}
{"text":"The food was okay, service needs work, prices are more than its worth.

FOOD - We ordered the kibbe, a Gyro, and the Phoenicia Combo.
- Kibbe: Flavor was good but it seemed to have been frozen for a while and then fried for serving. I grew up with this delicacy and can attest to the fact that it was served horribly at this restaurant. 
- Gyro: Possibly the best we've ever had. Delicious and I'd only come back for this dish alone.
- Phoenicia Combo: comes with choices, I chose hummus and greek fries. Greek fries weren't that good and hummus was average, at best. The lamb kebab and chicken skewers were well done in terms off flavor & cooked temperature.

SERVICE: The older lady was very sweet and cared to satisfy customers. While the young girl who was serving wasn't friendly and didn't know anything about the menu when she was asked.

PRICE: Our bill ended up being $30 and we took advantage of the 50% off one item discount available on Yelp. I'd say $30 is what the meal was worth w/o the discount. The 3.5% credit/debit card charge is ridiculous. I'd avoid this place just because of that alone."}
{"text":"Phoenicia Grill is where you need to go if you are looking for some good Greek food! I love this place! I am a huge Gyro fan and this is one or the best places that I have found for Gyros in the East Valley. Phoenicia grill also has hands down the best Greek fries you will ever have! Your body won't thank you for eating them but you will enjoy them! If you go I recommend the gyro and fries combo! It is my personal favorite"}
{"text":"Food is decent but they cheat you on the pricing. Do not expect to pay what the website states, esp for catering. Some idiot at the Gilbert location mumbles something about updating the website, yada, yada. This place is not ready for prime time. I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My favorite Gyro place.  Been going here for years.  Absolutely love the customer service here also.   I don't get the crowds at the pizza place near by...the pizza is yuck."}
{"text":"This my first time here. I have heard about it but not yet tried.

They had just started a buffet which always seems to attract my attention. 

Buffet was just average.  Limited choices for the price.  But the meat was very good.

This is a good place for a Gyro sandwich.  Not sure I will put it on top of my regular list."}
{"text":"We trusted yelp reviews and had high expectations for this place. I was pretty disappointed with our meal. The food tasted like it had been frozen and reheated to serve, missing flavor and freshness."}
{"text":"I love mom and pop shops like this one! Definitely a good spot to check out if you enjoy Mediterranean food! I highly recommend their tabouli, baba ghanoush, samosas and baklava are good and don't leave without a Turkish Coffee! 

The service is great and friendly, the owners are kind and always happy to see new faces. Pop on by and support a local owned business!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We had been going to pita jungle until I heard from a friend that this place was way better, they were right! Huge portions, flavorful, and reasonably priced. We also get a gyro and this time got Greek fries for the side. Both were delicious. Also got a combo shawarma with beef/chicken, rice and hommus. The beef was my favorite super flavorful. We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Gilbert for pita and hummus. It's a small colorful place with super friendly staff. We've never had to wait very long to be seated, and it's a good place for small to medium sized groups. Their kitchen is open so you can see them preparing food. The servers are really nice and I always get great service. I have tried the hummus trio, a sampler platter, and the falafel hummus sandwich. The last is my favorite so far, you get everything pita, falafel, hummus, and tahini sauce. I also really like their rice which is subtly flavored and their tabouli. The tahini and hummus always taste super fresh made and this is my favorite place to get tahini. One of my favorite regular spots. I'll even call and order and pick something up on my way home. Great for vegans and vegetarians, they have lots of tasty, filling options."}
{"text":"I love the food at this place. It is delicious. Prices are a bit high, but thr food is worth it. Conveniently located for the university crowd. It's one of my favorite restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I just came from the Sunday buffet here were i met up with Norm R. and Rand H. and wow was it goooood. I started with the lentil soup it was good .Then onto the salad table it was very good also and at this point I was thinking this place could hit five stars. Well when i got to the main dishes  I knew it was 5 star. They had this chicken dish that was so good but i dont remember what they called it . Meatballs, cabbage rolls rice,gyro meat.and some kind green bean and broccoli dish all of which were great. If you like great  food you will love this place.the decor was not to fancy but nice, not a lot of seating and i thought with food this good this place needs to be a lot bigger.I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"So good. Was going to go to mikes down the strip but it wasn't what we thought then the pizza place had long wait so thankfully we landed here. And man the food is awesome! And priced great for amount of food. Even kids meal is good bang for your buck. Our three kids gobbled it up which means it's really good! Service was exceptional, definitely coming back and telling friends about it!"}
{"text":"Phoenicia is a very consistent good restaurant and I think they and Pita Jungle get top notch ranks for their Gyros, They also have the best Chicken Shwarma which is always juicy and cooked with a wonderfully smokey flavor.  

The restaurant is clean and the staff is always very personal and warm.  They have a little section of to go items and the pitas they have a quite good when picked up with some of their baba ghanoush or hummis.  

The seating can be a little weird as they have a rectangular area in the middle where you can end up feeling cramped if the restaurant is full.  Parking can feel the same as it shares a lot with Gilbert Pizza and a few other places."}
{"text":"There's nothing like outdoor dining here on a perfect day.  The decor is not overdone.  It is simple, comfortable, and fits perfectly with the type of food they serve.

Those Greek Fries they serve are borderline orgasmic.  The first time I tried them, I almost cried.

Their chicken shwawirma is top tier.  It's the Porsche of chicken schwawirma's in AZ.  Their other entrees, side dishes and accompanying sauces are excellent and authentic.

If I lived closer, and if my budget allowed me to eat here on a 2x weekly basis, I really would.

Kudos to this restaurant.  They really do things the right way."}
{"text":"BEWARE OF THIS BUSINESS IF YOU USE THEM AS A CATERER. I wanted to have a tray of pastries for my baby shower. The price list advertises the tray at $49.95. I called the owner (Sylvia) to order and tell her I wanted 1/2 tray of a certain pastry and the other 1/2 another type. I specifically asked her if there would be a price change because of this accommodation, Sylvia responded that the price remained the same, $49.95. 

On the day of the shower, I go get the pastries and the person at the register tells me the price is $76, that there is nothing that he can do about it as the owner had placed the ticket and he could not change it. I asked him to call Sylvia: she told him on the phone that she never said the price would be the same as the one advertised...

Of course, one hour from the shower, there was nothing I could do, I took my order, but those pastries left me with a very bitter taste in my mouth. 

If you decide to do business with them, just make sure that they let you know if there is a change in the initial quote they give you."}
{"text":"I'll be honest that I only get one thing here, and that's a large order of their original hummus with an extra side of pita. It's so good that a friend who recently got back from Israel told me that it tastes as good if not better than their traditional hummus overseas. 

I'm drooling just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I visited this place for the 1st time today. I got the gyro sandwich. The meat was dry, bland, and old. I had wanted to get the kabob sandwich but they kept saying how long it would take. It comes with lettuce, tomato, and onion with tzatiki sauce. The lettuce was shredded and literally every single piece was wilted and brown. There was no onion and the tzatiki was actually ranch dressing.

They serve better gyros at the food court in the mall. I was starving when I went. I couldn't even bring myself to have more than a few bites. So now I'm going to eat a snickers out of the vending machine in the break room at work. What a waste."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go to eat! We've gone there multiple times & have had a really good experience every time! Their hummus is absolutely to die for and the chicken kabobs & rice are two of my favorite menu items. I get the chicken plate pretty much every time. The only \"complaint\" I have is that I wish that the plate came with both hummus & rice like the gyro does. I'd say this is definitely my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in the valley!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer - the only Greek food I ever eat is hummus from the grocery store.
My wife and I decided to try something a little different and found this place across the street. We had limited time in eating and the server was on top of it as we mentioned that to her as we were sitting. Service was really good.
I got the spinach pie and thought it was ok. The pastry was amazing but the spinach filling was just ok. My wife and I both got the gyro plate with two different hummus and Greek fries. The plate was amazing!!!! The meat was so flavorful. The red pepper hummus was very good. The fries...you must get the Greek fries. We are excited about going again!"}
{"text":"Cannot believe this place is still in business, nowhere close to Mediterranean food.(yakky).

Rude owner especially to employees, 2  weeks average before an employee quits according to our server, 

Do not be surprised if you're charged for something you did not order, he is very very famous for that."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!!! We are here on a regular! I dream of the Greek fries when I've went too long without them.  Gyro meat is perfection and the staff is always AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Good food here at Phoenicia.  But aloof, questionable and almost dismissive service kind of ruins an ordinarily positive experience. 

Like others say in their reviews the chicken shawerma and accompanying garlic sauce were pretty good.  I found the chicken to be a bit greasy and a bit overcooked - almost dry.  The sauce was a nice surprise, and wouldn't you know it, it was gone much sooner than I anticipated.  The chicken and garlic sauce left me otherwise unspeakable (Hello, my name is Dragonbreath) and burping the rest of the day.  But with food this good I had no regrets.  The saffron rice  was a winner, but the pita was a bit dry. 

It's kind of modest inside with brightly colored booths.  The wait during lunch time can be a bother.  We waited around for about 10 minutes and had to flag someone down since the guy was wrapped up at the cash register the whole time.  We were never given refills throughout our lunch -- only at the end when our table was cleared, and we were lingering for a half hour."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Looking for somewhere new to eat instead of the same old same old, considering there are a gazillion restaurants in the area! Yelped various Gilbert reviews and this place came up with good reviews and we thought Greek sounded pretty good.  We went a little overboard by ordering the sample plate (vegetarian), gyros & greek fries.  The sample plate favorites for me were the super delicious hummus/pita and the dolmathes. So in the future I would just order these directly.  The gyros are gi-normous with thick tender meat.  The greek fries with white sauce & feta were hot & delicious.  Then to top it off we took 2 pieces of almond, walnut, pecan baklava home with us along with our leftovers! Very flaky & oozing honey.  No complaints except the weight gain."}
{"text":"Awesome gyro, best we ever had. The prices are fair the people are amazing and the food is delicious! Nice portions, so full. Next time going for the baklava first!"}
{"text":"I need more hummas!!! We usually do take out at Phoenicia Grill. The food blows my mind. We love the chicken shawarma and the gyro plate. The greek fries rock my world. The baklava is sweet. The greek salad is great. The service is hit and miss. My fiance goes here a lot so he had made friends with the staff. We can't not complain about service since we have always had great service."}
{"text":"I'm in town for business for a few days. This place is close to my hotel so I popped in to try it. 

Fantastic gyros, friendly service and reasonably priced. 

Don't forget to pick up some baklava!"}
{"text":"We kept passing by this place. Last night a friend raved about it so we tried it for lunch today. First try was limited to gyros and dolmades. Probably the biggest gyro I have ever had with very tender meat... nice. Dolmades were great. Service was very good. Layout seems a little strange. We were not sure where to go when we walked in. The tables all had numbers on them so we didn't know whether they were taken or not? Hostess stand was all the way on the opposite of the room from the entry door. BUT, the food was really good. We are anxious to try some of the other things on the menu. Waiting to try the baklava we brought home:)"}
{"text":"I've been to Phoenicia a handful of times, and each time I try something new and I am never dissapointed! 
One thing I've noticed is that their daily specials are the best bet if you want to try something new and also get full. The daily specials usually are HUGE combos. 
On different occassions, I've tried the falafel pita boat, the hummus trio, the chicken shawarma and the baklava. ALL delicious. 
One tip- if you're in a rush, this may not be the best place to eat if you are coming during peak lunch hours. It's always packed. I've learned to go after 1pm and have had no problems being seated."}
{"text":"Love the lamb there! Definitely will come back again. The plate I ordered was a little bit pricey, but I really liked the food. Kinda wanna try the sandwiches next time. 
PS: they add tips into the check automatically."}
{"text":"The buffets on the weekends are the best! Highly recommend you bring your appetite and sense of humor as the staff always makes me smile."}
{"text":"We have been coming to the Phoenicia Cafe for some time and we love the Lamb, gyros, Greek salad and the hummus is the best in the valley, give it a try!"}
{"text":"We had walked by this place many times and had even gone into the store side (attached to the restaurant) to get some hummus, but had never gone into the restaurant. Finally went for lunch today with friends and was really happy we did. Attentive, quick service, super yummy food. Had the falafel which wasn't dried out, in the pita boat, which is just their pita sandwich..it was pretty gigantic. Friend had a gyro combo, which she was pleased with. And their baklava is to die for..some of the best I've ever had. I think their pita is homemade too..stretchy and fresh. It's not the prettiest place, but for cheap, authentic Middle Eastern food you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is a great little casual restaurant located south of Warner on Gilbert Road.  We've had the gyros, philly cheesesteaks, gyro salad, falafels, greek fries, lentil soup.  Excellent food every time.  Service and a sincerely friendly staff makes this a  go to place.  A bonus is that they offer a dinner all-you-can-eat buffet for a very reasonable price.  Great way to try many of their menu options.  I think they offer the buffet for lunch on weekends, but better call the restaurant to confirm.  It's a clean, fresh restaurant with a nice atmosphere to boot!  One of our new faves!"}
{"text":"Good bang for buck food. Nothing to brag about and nothing special compared to other restaurants. 

Ordered the big plate for two to share with my gilrfriend. Anahilated the food mostly due to hunger but the food is reasonably priced and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"We found this gem while on our family Thursday night out.  What a surprise!  The food is excellent, the portions are way too big for eating at one sitting, and the staff is so pleasant.  We go for dinner at least once a month, now.  The gyro platter is our favorite, along with the delicious lentil soup.    We've tried other items, and they are just as great.  We've never had the weekend buffet, since we work on the weekends.  On your way out, buy some baklava to take home.  It's made fresh daily, and will definitely satisfy any sweet cravings you have after stuffing yourself on the gyros and rice, or the to-die-for Greek fries.    Opa!!!"}
{"text":"Pros:  Food was great!  Chicken Shawarma was flavorful and juicy and good size portion.  Like the option of getting two sides as well instead of just one.  My wife ordered the falafel and another good size portion.  Some of the best middle eastern cuisine I've had in the area in a while.  Also had a great deal where if you checked into Yelp, got a item at half price with purchase of regular price item.

Cons:   Service was awful!  Which is weird due to all of the reviews that lauded the service.  It took the waiter about 15 min. to take our order.  Had to also remind him about the hummus we ordered before the entrees.  Waiter came and picked up my debit card...and didn't see him for like 10 minutes.  Who knows what was going on with that.  Saw three different waiters at our table and none really seemed to know who was taking care of us.  All the staff seemed to have no guidance and was a little too laid back, especially when it got busy.  The table next to us had some of their food forgotten and again had to remind the staff what they ordered.  

Overall food was great, but we will definitely be planning on take out next time."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere but they need to work on their service. Very long waits and unordered service. We came in before 2 groups and our order was taken after theirs. You can be sitting for 15 mins before being approached. We only come back for the food."}
{"text":"The food was disappointing. The tzatziki tasted like sour cream, the rice was so under seasoned you could taste the chlorine flavor form it being cooked in unfiltered water and the hummus had no taste at all and the pita bread was stale. There was not one pleasant flavor on the plate."}
{"text":"Discombobulated .... the staff didn't seem to know how to take or make an order. My to go order took 45 minutes to come out. People that walked up and placed orders after me got theirs before me. I understand some orders are easier to make... yadda yadda!! when I asked if they had lost my order they said no. Then I could hear them discussing my order in the kitchen area. Hello .... I'm here on the other side of the counter. Long story short... the service was poor, the wait was long and the food wasn't worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, however they don't understand the concept of a take out order.  When you call ahead to place an order, you expect the food to be ready when you get there 20 minutes later.  Unfortunately it always seems like they don't start making your take out order until you get there so you end up waiting for your order anyway.  I would give them 4 stars if not for this inconvenience."}
{"text":"Two words: FALAFEL DELUXE. Don't wear a tux when you eat our falafel deluxe. That should be their tag line. Because you might spill hommos. Hummus. Humdinger?
The owner guy seems like a grump but everyone has a crappy boss at least once in their life, right? Everyone else in there is nice. Even little Timmy. He's responsible for picking up stray falafel balls. Keep up the good work, Timmy, and we'll put you on gyro meat!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place but have not gone in over a year. I went here the other day and the place was dead. It looks like it is going to go out of business. It was i2 in the afternoon and there wasn't one person behind the counter working and no one was eating inside. I could have robbed the place and no one would have known. I walked in and two guys lazily came out but no one greeted me. The grille wasn't even turned on. I'm sorry but I had no patience to wait 30 minutes for them to make me a fallafel and french fries because the fryers and grill was turned off due to a lack of customers. I just walked out of there and no one proceeded to stop me or ask me if they could help me. The menu was also different and worse. The previous menu had combo platters and prices, this one just had pictures of food with no prices attached or lists.  I can tell this particular branch is going out of business. They had no customers.  It's sad because two years ago, this place was packed and thriving."}
{"text":"Great authentic Greek food. People there were really nice and the food was very good. Good location."}
{"text":"I had chicken kafta here and the chicken dosent have any spice . The hummus, falafel ,tabouli and toum were good."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek food I've ever had. I've been to Greek places before, but this restaurant has always been my go to place. I've been here over twenty times and I've never been disappointed. The food is delicious, and the owner, Sylvia, is always smiling and kind. I always order a gyro sandwich with Greek fries, and I've always been pleased. The sandwich is always stuffed to the brim with meat and the fries are always crispy.  Every time I have a chance I take someone here that hasn't been here. Always recommended."}
{"text":"We found this place via the fabulous Yelp mobile app.  We were in a part of Gilbert I don't find myself in very often.  It was rated quite highly and we were in the mood for Mediterranean fare.   

The outside is somewhat misleading.  There are advertisements all over the windows for standard \"American food\".  It reminds me of some of the restaurants I've seen in Europe that are trying to appear or cater to Americans (\"USA Fried Chicken\", for example.)  

We were quickly seated and a quick glance at the menu confirmed that we were indeed in Hummus-ville.  The food was delicious.  The hummus was extremely smooth and creamy and had great flavor.  The pita bread was standard and given it's primarily a delivery system of hummus, I'm okay with this.  My falafel veggie wrap was delicious and my husband thought his gyro was the best he's ever had.  We both ordered the Greek fries.  I've always wondered about the authenticity of those because it seems like an excellent way to draw in Americans.  But no matter... they are gooey and delicious.  

This is definitely a great little find.  I wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"I live in California but I make an extra effort to eat here every time I'm back home in Arizona. Their food is unreal: the gyros are packed with meat, the hummus is delicious, and you simply can't beat the Greek fries with Feta cheese on them, my favorite item on the menu! The food is all reasonably priced and the service is great: the owner is extremely friendly and always says hi when I stop in. If you're really hungry, or even if you're not, don't forget to get their handmade baklava on the way out!"}
{"text":"We used their catering service and the food was amazing. The chicken shawarma, beef kabab and gyro meat were delicious. Also, the owners are nice and provided great customer service."}
{"text":"Great food. Good service if you are looking for take out it is a great option. Gyro is delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty authentic made fresh and a lot of it is very healthy. Our kids like it and the server Joe is awesome. No matter how crazy our requests for our kids are. He makes it happen. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, the restaurant is clean and tidy, plenty of great menu items. The owner was friendly and greeted us. I had the small Greek salad with gyro meat and it was amazing. We split the Greek fries and they were amazing!!  My sister had the Falafel and she said that it was the best that she has ever had.  
This instantly became a favorite spot."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the \"Vegetarian Sampler\", a staple at many Greek or Middle Eastern restaurants.  This is usually dolmades, hummus, babba ghanoush, falafel, tahini sauce, and tabouli.  With plenty of warm pita to scoop it up.  Well, that's what it is here.  And I keep coming back for more.  On a recent visit, it was chilly outside and a bit inside, as well, so when I picked up a piece of pita and ripped it, the warmth of it in my hands made me feel good all over.  So did the other food.  The hummus is very smooth and with a pleasant garlic flavor, not too potent.  The babba ghanoush has that great smokey flavor and more chunky.  The dolmades were small and cold, so hard to really taste the flavor.  The falafel was warm and tasty, not too tender inside but not too hard.  Nice to dip in the tahini sauce.  The tabouli was lots of chopped parsley, with a bit more of green and red onion than I like, but refreshing.  The pita stayed nice and moist and warm through most of the meal, which is a mark of good pita.  

There isn't much to the decor, but service is always quick and cheerful.  I've never been here when it is very crowded, which is good for me, but not for the business.  Hopefully they get more busy another time.

This place isn't too far from me, so I hope to try more of their offerings.  I've had Middle Eastern food that's better, but Phoenicia offers an excellent blend of convenience, value, and quality.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Although this is a Mediterranean place, we actually go to them for their burgers, since they are one of the few places in the East valley that serve halal meat. The burgers are generally good, sometimes better than others. I am not sure if they use fresh beef patties or they use the frozen halal kind you can pick up from restaurant depot. But the stand out item for us are the Greek Fries that you can order along with the burgers. Crispy fries with the tangy white dressing and feta cheese. The fries have never let us down and that's why we keep returning.

Also, have to say they have super nice guys working there. Always very helpful and cheerful. Service can sometimes be a little slow and for some reason we can't place our order on the phone, so that it's ready by the time we get there."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best gyro I've ever had and it's inexpensive! Perfectly seasoned thick cut shaved gyro meat right off the broiler - no pre-sliced frozen meat here. Can't wait to go back. Mouth watering as I write this..."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. Never go there!!!! Went there and had a gyro sandwich got diarrhea right at the same day. I heard similar stories frm my friends and family member @ different times of their visit. We ll never come back!!!!!"}
{"text":"the gyro combo was so good. get the greek fries, you wont be disappointed. very friendly staff will make you feel at home"}
{"text":"good food. slow, but friendly service. the thing that brought the score down for me is the additional 3.5% charge to pay by debit or credit card. 

yes, i understand that the establishment pays this to VISA, but it is irritating to have it passed on to me. Especially when they charge $2.50 for a soda that costs them pennies. Seems like i have already covered their fee. 

They offer a \"discount\" of 3.5% to pay cash. in other words, the discounted price is the actual price of the order."}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant, food was amazing, but service was a little slow. It's the only place I go to get an authentic Mediterranean food! If you're not on a time crunch and want quality food, then stop by here! I personally enjoyed the Chicken Shawarma Plate, it can with the ability to get two sides. I decided on rice and tabouli and to top it I got 1 baklava and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Wife loves this place but I've never been a huge fan of Mediterranean food before...until now.  Had the gyro sandwich and Greek fries and they were incredible!  Tried the Sharwarma salad as well ;). I have never had gyro meat be as tender and perfectly seasoned/prepared in my life. Service was excellent and price was unbelievable. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"There's no shortage of options if you want Middle Eastern food in Tempe, especially around ASU. Luckily there's no confusion about which one is THE BEST.

Not only is this the best Middle Eastern retaurant in The Valley, it's also MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN ALL OF TEMPE. 

The chicken Shwarma is delicious, and the hummus is the best in the state. For a cheap meal, try the \"hommus deluxe\" with chicken or lamb. It eats like a meal. 

Tack on a delightful staff, and a comfortable atmosphere, and what you have is probably the most underrated restaurant in Arizona.

\"Best hummus\", \"best Middle Eastern food\", \"best restaurant in Tempe\", \"most underrated\"...I know, that's a lot of superlatives - this place deserves each one."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! Everything is so good. I love it..  The owner is truly one of the nicest people I have met and her staff are so attentive. They leave us feeling like family.

If you have the time to stop by, don't hesitate... You'll surely like the food!"}
{"text":"I love this place the Chicken wrap shawarma is my favorite. Been ordering here for months."}
{"text":"This food is fresh, hot and delicious! Service was great, and the perfect place to have a nice meal before heading over to movie theater nearby. 

If you're too full to have dessert, take a baklava to go! It's out of this world!!

Will definitely be back soon and also plan to use their catering as I saw a couple orders being picked up by folks on their way to holiday gatherings... a brilliant option for pot-luck gatherings!"}
{"text":"I asked the kid what she wanted for dinner and she straight up said, \"LAMB\" 

So using dear old yelp again, we found this place, and we liked it.

I ordered the vegetarian sampler, which came with falafels, tabouli, hummus, and stuffed grape leaves. The falafel was really crispy on the outside and moist in the inside, the hummus tasted fresh, and I did like the stuffed grape leaves, although I read in one of the reviews below it came out of a can...which is ok for me I guess, as I will be on the hunt for one of these cans...they were good. 

My friend ordered the gyros plate ---- and yes, the meat was good!!! 

We were all pretty stuffed, but when we saw that they had crepes we had to order them. I had the nutella crepe and my friend ordered the apple cinnamon crepe. They were huge! I think 1 crepe would have been enough for all 3 of us. Both were very delicious - my nutella crepe had bananas, strawberry sauce, and whipped cream on it - I wish I could tell you what was in the apple cinnamon one, but my face was too busy being stuffed with nutella goodness. I ate the whole thing leaving me...really stuffed.

As we left to pay guess what else I found that they had?! TURKISH DELIGHT!!! I had to eat one (gah...I just can't stop). IT WAS GOOD TOO!

Oh and the lady that served us was really friendly :)"}
{"text":"What great food and experience yesterday!!! We ordered by phone and picked up got it home it was still hot.  I asked for it to be spicy & the chicken was wonderful!!!  Thank you again for the great experience and food!!"}
{"text":"This Mediterranean restaurant has a really great weekend buffet, as Rand H., Mike C. found out during our buffet excursion here. I started the meal with a mild but tasty lentil soup, then went on to a refreshing parsley salad, savory meatballs, tasty vegetable dishes (vegetarians will like this place for sure) ... and the *best* shawarma I've ever had!  And just when I thought it couldn't get any better, as I was paying for the meal I noticed trays of tempting baklava near the cashier (sneaky!) ... these came in almond, walnut and pistachio, and I just had to try the pistachio one. It was pure heaven, buttery goodness with an abundance of crushed pistachio and dripping with honey -- an awesome finish to an amazing meal."}
{"text":"It was 10:30am and my wife, sister and I were very hungry. 

We were in the area, which we never are, and needed some chow quickly. At first, we wanted Pei Wei! Closed. Chipotle? Closed. 

We really didn't want to leave the complex so we decided to search. Then, we found this place. 

It was about 10:45am and the sign said they opened at 11am but one of the workers told us to go right in.  

I liked the mom and pop feel of the shop! We go in and we're immediately greeted by a young lady who tells us to seat ourselves. 

We didn't realize it was an actual sit-down restaurant where they take your order. We thought it was one of those fast-casual type of places. Unfortunately, we were kind of in a hurry so we placed our order to go. 

I'm kind of on this burger kick. I broke my \"no eating flour\" kick last night when I had a burger at the Garage in Phoenix, and felt like eating another. So, I decided, what the hell. One more won't hurt! You can go back to that afterward. 

I looked at the burger list. The Greek Burger. Greek Fries. 

Oh man. 

So good. The burger was fantastic. The fries were to die for. It was smotherd in feta and a thick greek sauce. My wife kept eating my fries. So to get back at her, I ate some of her gyro. She got the gyro platter. That was very good too. 

If I'm ever back in the area, I'd be up for this place again."}
{"text":"Coworkers and I went here for dinner and everything we ordered was delicious from appetizers, multiple main courses and desert. The owner came out and chatted with us and was so pleasant. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great dinner.  I stopped in to grab a quick bite for my wife and I. The service from start to finish was fast, and very friendly. The food was fantastic.  This is one of those restaurants that takes pride in each individual dish that goes out. Great stuff!!"}
{"text":"Oh wow...this place is really good!  I've been a couple of times now and I could go on and on (you know I could), but really, it's excellent almost all the way around. I've tried a few different things on the menu by this point, as you can see by my pictures, and everything has been delicious.  Their tabouli has to be some of the freshest I've ever had, and the meats are full of flavor.  The only reasons they don't get 5 stars are because the service is a little shaky at times, and the one time I got the chicken kabob, it was a pretty skimpy portion.  Other than that, I would go back any time.  They also have a Yelp check-in offer of 50% off your second entree, which is a great deal.  Their prices are reasonable anyway, even without a discount."}
{"text":"Awesome hummus,  taboli,  gyro and Shawarma, baclava and the garlic dip is a must have with your meat. Great people and good service. This is a family favorite!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this spot for at least 10 years. The owners and staff having been nothing but exceptionally nice to us. My kid is pretty picky about food, but he craves the chicken shawarma. It's not explicitly on the menu, but we always order a basket of shawarma and fries for him, and they have no problem with the special order. The food has always been excellent. I tend to order the chicken kabob plate, but I've tried the shawarma, the gyro, the vegetarian sampler, the shish kabob, and the kafta kabob. Everything has been excellent, but the chicken items really stand out. They offer a buffet, but I tend not to go for that - I watch my calories and I know I will gorge. If you do get the buffet, try the lentil soup and make sure you add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice - it makes the soup come alive! If you have the space, try the baklava. If not, try it anyway."}
{"text":"Very friendly server and delicious food. The gyro combination can easily feed 2.  Food came out quick and had lots of flavor. The check out process is strange as you pay the counter of the convenience store/market. Overall a great meal at a good price!"}
{"text":"The food was great, relatively cheap and prepared quickly.  I wasn't extremely hungry so I ordered the hummus topped with gyro.  Man!  I couldn't have ordered anything better.  The hummus was extremely fresh tasting and the gyro was very tender.  I would order this dish over and over again.  Served with their really good pita bread, it was a perfect meal."}
{"text":"great cafe.  I'll be going back for sure"}
{"text":"I adore Phoenicia. Since moving to Tempe the market has become my go-to place for take-home hummus, feta, baklava (walnut, pistachio, cashew...) and yoghurt. Plus random other goodies on their shelves like coconut oil, spices, and olive oil soaps. Not to mention the crispy falafel and big green salads when I eat in the restaurant. Love the staff, always so happy to see me and they miss me if I miss a week. I've been going every week since moving here. Love it, try it, good food and good service win me over every time! On the patio on a sunny day----nice!!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice so far and both times the food had been good. Hummus trio with a side of chicken is delicious! 

Food:
I usually get the chicken shawarma with saffron rice and tabouli and its been great each time. The hummus has always been tasty as well!

Staff:
They are courteous and didn't have any issues with going outside of the item on the menu for my wife."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food that I have ever had, delicious rice, chicken shawarma, pita  and hummus. The list of delicious foods goes on and on. Great service also, all the waiters are extremely friendly, and the food always arrives quickly. Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had a buffet lunch today. Lots of meat and salad and humus. But not cooked properly. Mostly not seasoned well. Too expensive for 12.95. Fish was dry and flavorless. Plus as the other reviews have not the lady at the checkout is really mean. I had a coupon for 15% off, she says is for night buffet. The coupon did not say that, plus the price of the night buffet is the same as the day buffet. Looks like they just don't like customers.
My advise, avoid this place, lots of better places in town."}
{"text":"I stop in as often as I can.  My favorite dish is the Hummus Deluxe.  The Baklava is rich and delicious."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Good food, always, and the store has a lot of goodies. The only issue we seem to have lately, is that whenever we come in on a saturday for lunch, there is always either some big catering order or large take-out order that totally stalls the tiny kitchen.

Call ahead if you don't want to wait 30 min or more for your food. 

Other than that, the food is always just right. The Gyro plate is the best."}
{"text":"We decided to go here instead of Pita Jungle and the whole family was glad we did. My son who usually just picks at his food devoured the whole plate. My gyro was way better than Pita Jungle and they have Arabic coffee that is awesome. My wife also enjoyed her falafel sandwich. This place is a little further from our house but we will be making the slightly longer drive to enjoy the much better Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"This place is literally as good as it gets.  Service has always been superior, very friendly family owned business.  The food is even better.  I have never been disappointed here.  The hummus is so tasty and I could just eat an entire meal of it.  Of course, I wanted dessert first.  they make homemade baklava there.  Just give me that any day or night and I will take it.  It is melt in your mouth awesome!!!!!  Or maybe I should say it's bad so I can eat it all???  Nah, I will be fair and just say get it while you can!!!  We have tried a few different entrees and have never been disappointed in anything we have tried.  My favorite is still the Gyros.  (with Baklava for dessert)!!!!"}
{"text":"recommended by a friend, didn't even know this was here!! but this is a must try place for Mediterranean food, the gyro  is great but i always love the shish combo when i go here the best hummus in my opinion, ive gone to persian room for long time but glad this place is much closer to my house!! And yeah, after my friend told me about this place i come here all the time bringing other friends and family when come to visit in town they loved it as well!! ohh they also have a few different types of baklava, i had the one drizzled in chocolate it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch here a couple of times and I have been very pleased with my meals.  The service is good, though it seems that the kitchen staff is a little slow.  Don't stop in here thinking you can cram a meal into your 30 minute lunch break.

I have tried a number of items here and found them all to be delicious.  The portions are very generous and I've never been able to finish an appetizer and meal.  Generally I split the hommus and lebne with a coworker, we each get a meal, and we take most of everything home as delicious leftovers.

Check out the bakery, the baklava is decent and it's cheap- plus they have varieties that I have never seen, like almond/hazelnut.  And you can't go wrong with fresh, warm pita!

Recommended:  Hommus, Hommus Deluxe with Lamb, Lebne (best I've ever had), Shish Kabob pita combo (comes with a drink and fries for $7.99), and the Gyro Platter."}
{"text":"Waiter promised we \"will never go back to Pita Jungle after this.\"  I see what he means.  Food is great (still will go to Pita Jungle when feeling like healthier and refreshing Greek food)!  

The lamb hummus is my favorite and I order this every time now.  The lamb pieces are bite-sized and grilled well.  It sits on top of hummus and an enticing pool of olive oil with toasted almonds on top.  

I also like their Phoenicia combo platter with chicken kebab and a ground beef and lamb patty.  Meat is not dry and is tasty but very good combine with their basmati rice and excellent tabouli.  

They gave us a some Greek fries on the house which was nice but they were overrated.  The combo of yogurt sauce and feta was over top too rich on the fries. 

The best part is their baklava station. Trays with rows of homemade glistening baklava sit in front of your eyes calling your name. It's impossible to pass up!  They have 4 or more different nut flavors and all taste amazing especially with a scoop of ice cream - says the person who never liked baklava until she stepped foot in Phoenicia."}
{"text":"I started going to their original location in Tempe, and let me tell you - they lost nothing by expanding.  If you like Middle Eastern food, this is a great place to try out - with more of a fast food then full on dining experience.  Get the Greek Fries - awesome fries covered in Feta and Taziki sauce!  One order is plenty to share with at least 2 people, I have yet to finish an order when I get other food.  The pitas and gyros are great, the lamb is always seasoned perfectly.  One of my favorite places to go for an amazing meal that doesn't take an hour!"}
{"text":"Great food and delicious. It is pricy for what it is. From the pictures I expected a casual dining concept not one with a server. 

The food pieces reflect a restaurant price. That plus tipping a server makes it an expensive meal for the casual environment."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and even better service. One Friday night, I watched one server handle the entire dining room solo. Through it all, he was fast, attentive and pleasant. Can't recommend this place enough.

Also, the TVs usually are tuned to NFL Network or NBA TV, so I get to watch sports (cool!) with my awesome food."}
{"text":"Casual diner. Ventilation was not great and you could feel the cooking nearby. The food of hummus deluxe with lamb; the hummus lacked texture (very thin) and seasoning. The lamb was tasty, but over cooked. The dolmades needed something to offset plain rice inside. Service was good. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"Awesome food al the time!! Love this place. Always great service. Fresh food never ever disappoint no matter what day it is!!"}
{"text":"We came back after a long absence and tried some entrees we've never tried before (or forgot). We then came back the next night. Yeah...it was that good!

First of all...I'm not into French Fries, never have been...until I tried their Greek fries. Holy mother of grease and calories! They hit my stressed out \"I don't care about calories\" heart dead center. YUMMY!  I wish I remembered the names of all we are, but I don't. I do know we ate til we were stuffed, took home leftovers and cane back a couple days later for more. I'll post pix...know it was all good. Know also if I'm not back for awhile it's because I WANT Greek fries but should NOT eat Greek fries and they were too good to resist."}
{"text":"Food is tasty and fresh. Service is another story. Well meaning servers whiz past you and need to be ridden like a horse to take your order or payment. Shawarma is very tasty, hummus too. Pricey but if you have low service expectations, this is a great place to visit for good food."}
{"text":"One of those places you typically drive by and wonder, \"wonder if that's any good?\" Located right next to the blue and white mosque off Forest Avenue near ASU, Phoenicia gives you that feeling of eating off the beaten path. A co-worker of mine and I went on lunch, while we found a seat, the service was pretty slow. I ordered a plate of hummus (because I could down a tub of it in one sitting) and needless to say I was pretty disappointed. The hummus was not overly flavored - boring and bland. We split a falafel plate - consisting of 2 falafel pitas and rice. It was pretty good. Not spectacular, but decent. We also ordered some baklava to go - the traditional flavor was best, I don't recommend the chocolate one, too slimy."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong here.  Everything is high in quality and freshness.  The staff is always friendly.  I have been going to this place for years and it never disappoints.  Try the couscous o chicken.  Also nice is the shawarma plate with rice, hummus and salad.  If you are not heavy eaters, either is good to share with a friend or date."}
{"text":"This place is awesome all the way around!!!  Food was great!!!  I had them bring me what ever they thought was good and I got hummas, chicken ghal.. and pistachio balklavia with tea.  Hakim the waiter honestly is faboulous!!!  I would eat here again just to have his great service!!!"}
{"text":"Clean place with good food. The bad thing is that they are so good that they get pretty crowded. We had to wait close to 15 minutes before someone came to our table because they were so packed but the hummus, kabobs, rice and pita were all pretty good."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been coming here for nearly five years; ever since I moved out to AZ, and it has always been amazing. It's a perfect place to go for lunch and since it's not directly on Mill, you can go on a nice walk after eating. The service is always fantastic and the staff will begin to recognize you if you are there often enough.

There are a few things that are a must try on the menu. First and foremost is their hummus. It is my favorite in the valley as of right now. They add a lot of garlic and the flavors will make your tongue dance, especially if you add a little sriracha. Next up, the falafel deluxe...two pita boats loaded with hummus, tahini, tabbouleh and falafel, and served with a salad or rice. So much food for around $8 and so good! The last thing that is a must try are the Greek fries. They seriously topple other places that offer a similar version of the fries. 

Again, this restaurant is close to my heart. I found it after being spoiled with great Middle Eastern food in Chicago and have been extremely happy ever since my first bite.

Tana'amoo bilhayat! Talathathoo bitta'aam!"}
{"text":"Great service, knowledgeable staff and very accommodating dietary issues, wonderful hummus, i have never had a bad meal from them."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I will  be back. My meal was amazing. The waiter was so accomendating to us and very nice we had a lot of questions.  One of the girls in my party is vegetarian and had to make sure her food wasn't cooked in the same oil as the meat. He assured  that it was cooked separate he also reccommened my meal and I loved it. The portions are really big which I was disappointed. That's right disappointed I really wanted to try the baklava but I was to full! Maybe next time ;-)"}
{"text":"The food is really good and the staff is nice.  It's our go to place for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Gyro places ever!! Consistently delicious every time we have gone. Just note it is not a fancy place, although you can dine in, it is very casual and family run!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I go here a lot. She really loves it. She gets chicken swarma. Always pretty good. I get gyros pita. Ordering gyros here is very hit and miss. They leave it on the spit way too long. Today my gyros was crispy. How can it be crispy? Ridiculous. Some days it's melt in your mouth and awesome. It's about 50/50. I guess they don't want to throw away food. Christina's on chandler blvd and Lindsey is way more dependable for gyros."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, the chicken schwarma was exactly what I wanted and an awesome price for the combo. The hummus is also great, and the Greek fries are a must try. Service was equally great, our server was informative and prompt. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Not only does the food taste great but the staff are friendly and helpful.  Support local business and enjoy a great meal at the Phonecia Cafe!"}
{"text":"Decent lunch.

Had the vegetarian platter.  My favorite was the baba ganoush. 

Easy to find coupons for... including the entertainment book.  The greek fries sound tasty."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem right near ASU. It's hard to find good places to eat near ASU since so many of them leave but this place is here to stay. 

One night I was craving Greek fries so we decided to grab a few as well as some sides. So we grabbed a table and perused their menu. They have a lot of traditional Greek dishes but I ordered the Greek Fries and spanakopita. I asked for extra dressing and feta on my fries and let me tell you I was not disappointing. The ranch dressing they use has a bit of a bit since it has a heavy vinegar base. It compliments the saltiness of the fries as well as the feta. It is so filling that I couldn't even finish my spanakopita which was amazing. It had the perfect amount of spinach and the tzatziki was out  of this world.

The service was friendly, quick and the meal was cheap. Great deal for your money. You pay for your bill in the store which gives you a chance to buy baked items or other traditional Mediterranean foods. We love the tzatziki so much that we bought some to go as well as their ranch dressing.

Definitely check this place out and their metered parking in front of their restaurant is free after 6pm."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of them middle east when I was deployed in the military. Great food and great customer service. I'm always greeted and welcomed."}
{"text":"Pleasant ambiance and super friendly attentive service.  

Cilantro hummous is Super Fantastico!  Fresh, creamy and nice flavor profile.  We messed up on the pita to hummous scooping ratio and they were quick to bring in warm soft reinforcements!

Bitterly regretted skipping dessert when I walked by large pans of luscious, glistening, layered love and honey.  Baklava - I'll Be Back!  Locally Owned always a PLUS!"}
{"text":"Its really hard finding a restaurant that isn't afraid to use garlic! Their garlic sauce is delicious and I'm comparing it to Arabic food central from Dearborn, MI! =)"}
{"text":"Chicken Sharma was real good . Talked to owner she was nice . Will go back desserts look good but I didn't try them"}
{"text":"Went here last nite solo this is a comfortable space service was good I had the small order of the baba ganouje which was enough for 2/3 people and a order of the kaftan kabob which was also a good size order with that you get to pick two sides I had fries ( fair) coleslaw (good) next time I will be a little more creative with my sides they have breakfast on sat/ sun which I look forward to trying"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites for a quick, fresh Mediterranean lunch! Their food is fantastic, and the service is always so fast and kind. My standby is the schawarma salad, but today I tried the chicken kabobs, and it's definitely my new go-to! The portions are so generous, you're certain to have leftovers (or at least not to leave hungry)! I always eye the baklava behind the counter, but the day still hasn't come when I've had enough of an appetite to enjoy both the meal and dessert. The chicken is always juicy and flavorful, and in the kabob's case, comes with a great garlic sauce (a little goes a long way!) to dip it in. The hummus and pita that come with it are one of my favorite parts of the meal! This place reminds me of a halal Mediterranean'ized Defalco's, if you've ever been there. It's half grocer, half restaurant with an all-too-tempting dessert counter. If you're looking for authentic, fresh Middle Eastern food stop in here... it's the best!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and don't make it due to location nearly enough. From delicious shawarma with loads of garlic sauce (oh yeah, I smell but I'm happy) to gyros. My favorite is the homemade baklava."}
{"text":"Great presentation of food.  But wish my Greek fries were hot, beef kebab was dry and tough.  May give it another try for their gyro.  Service was friendly but they disappeared towards the end of our meal, left us waiting for our check."}
{"text":"I have been going to Phoenicia grill for almost 2 years. It was pretty good tasteful food in the beginning. Decent prices. I remember friendly service and gesture of getting 25% off coupon for next trip. Beef kafta were great and they would even give free lentil soup while you wait for take out orders. Those days are gone. 
Couple of weeks ago tried to redeem a coupon but was told restrictions apply. Today ordered two combo plates and a gyro. Looks like beef kafta got shrink to kids size meal. Chicken skewer had 3 tiny pieces and hardly anything else. Looks like they split old days meal into two and selling it as two meals. I know people should loose weight but change in portion side is pretty sudden. You can definitely get better food at zk grill for much better price points. Another great option is Rania which has so much better quality food. Bye bye Phoenicia grill..."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE  this place.
Stopped in on a Saturday before bowling next door the whole entire staff was INCREDIBLE!!
2 gyro's for me and my daughter and my son just wanted french fries. The lady behind the counter came out to chat with us.......\"NO GYRO FOR YOU?\" she went back and got him a little plate of meat to try......totally awesome.
So I made a mental note to check in on Yelp and BOOM.....50% off your 2nd item......BONUS!!!!!
I love this place even more now. We stopped in for a quick lunch and CANT WAIT to come back for a full dinner.

 Phoenicia great job.....We're big fans now....see you soon!!!"}
{"text":"A truly good authentic chicken shawarma holds very strict criteria and high standards. This is due in part to the dish being so popular that even the smallest variation of ingredients can make this dish not as good compared to others. The best way to prepare a chicken Shawarma is to make sure all of the meats have been prepared correctly; including having been tenderize and roasted for at least one day. This piece of criteria allows for the chicken shawarma to truly obtain all of its delicious flavors because the meats will become perfected and will also have time to roast and mature.
 
The chicken Sharma for which I sampled at the Phoenician restaurant did indeed be this criteria because the meat was very tender, especially the chicken dish for which I ordered. The chicken had been roasted for one and a half days. I found this out because I asked the owner to fill me in on the recipe and how the food item was prepared and for how long. I discovered that the chicken Shawarma also met the criteria of being high quality because the meats were slowly roasted with special hand-picked house blended sauce; allowing for all of the meats to caramelize and obtain juiciness while they became tender."}
{"text":"It was Saturday afternoon and I wanted to pick up lunch for the two of us somewhere. Being that is was the holiday season I wanted to avoid San Tan Village area because I knew the parking lot would be a zoo. So I drove west and ended up on Gilbert Rd. & remembered passing by this place.

I ordered a Gyro Pita, Chicken Schwarma & some Greek Fries . I didn't wait very long before my food was ready. Gyro was good. Plenty of meat. Chicken Schwarma was pretty decent. I wouldve liked the chicken to be more seasoned but I like that they put hummus inside the pita. The Greek Fries were awesome! Probably the best version I've had. At other places the sauce on it is a little too tangy for my tastes.

I will have to come back again and try their buffet lunch. I'm sure it would be delicious & for 12.95 per person, that's a pretty sweet deal!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place yesterday after having pizza from Gilbert Pizza next door. The hubby is a big fan of gyros and figured that since he is never in that area, he might as well try a gyro. After realizing they had crepes (I fricken love crepes and thought back to the wonderful ones I had in Germany) I was sold on going for dessert. The service was very friendly, the owner was so funny and warm. Our waitress was extremely friendly and accommodating as well. They treated us like we were family even though they didn't even know our names. Hubby ordered the gyro, I ordered the nutella crepes with strawberry and banana. The gyro is large for what you pay and has tons of meat in it, no lettuce which made the hubby very happy. The only thing was that there was no feta on it which we feel is a key component of a gyro. He said the gyro was good and a good value but he would prefer the sauce to have more flavor and for some feta to be added. My crepes came with just banana, no strawberry, however, I decided not to mention it because the crepe was out of this world. I loved the crispy edges. The owner noticed though that there were no berries and quickly brought some over. They made it even better! Definitely get the crepe with berries! You wont be sorry. They also have a lunch buffet on Friday - Sunday which looked sooo tempting if we hadn't just eaten a half a pizza next door. Haha. We will have to go there and try the buffet as everything looked really delicious."}
{"text":"20 years of operation should be your first indicator, in an area where most places can not last 20 months, Phoenicia caf√© with flavorful authentic dishes at reasonable prices endures. 

The menu has many sub $10 items in the sandwich and appetizer section, larger entrees are a bit about $10. There is sit down table service, a counter and to go.

I had the deluxe falafel combo that included two small pitas stuff with crisp falafel rich hummus and fresh tubule. It included a side salad (or rice) for $8 a great deal. I cant wait to try my next meal here."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the valley! We ordered the falafel hommus pita with Greek fries and the lamb and couscous. My boyfriend is from Tunisia and said this was the best couscous he has had here! The family who owns the business are very friendly and accommodating! The drive from North Scottsdale was definitely worth it and we look forward to coming back! Ayechkom Habibi"}
{"text":"soo.. AFTER the long 6 hr drive to Arizona... i Came here during my Vacation . Got the Lamb shank. it was pretty good. not as great as Kerostena but it was pretty good for a spot in Arizona. the rice it came with was drenched in a tango sweet tomato sauce. portion was pretty decent it. Rice was kinda soupy with too much tomato sauce. The lamb shank was decent portion. wished it had more flavor.  they gave us free soup and since it was my friends brithday they gave her a free dessert. it was sweet of them. They also had a salad all you can eat bar for $12 which the waitress did not mention =/ i was starving too.. she could have wheeled me in that plus the $15 plate of lamb shank =/ oh well LOL. i feasted like a beast from hungry and dehydration. The smoothies there are made from real berries cz i swallowed a few chunks of strawberries and nearly choked LOL but it was worth it. at least i know it wasd fresh right? =] LOL 

sorry guys. i had to take 1 star off cz no one told us about the salad buffet and we were super hungry =/"}
{"text":"I've never had anything that wasn't delicious and served attentively, and I've been here at least 4x. The Greek fries and chicken shawarma are always delicious. I've never had anything from Phoenicia that wasn't completely satisfying."}
{"text":"This is the best place!  We crave their food and eat here at least once every few weeks!  They have the best Greek Fries and amazing plate combos!  I especially love their Rack of Lamb!  We love The Persian Room in N Scottsdale, this is very comparable just slight different taste in a few things, but both EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"What a fun restaurant with awesome Greek and American food! I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Their baklava will make your knees buckle. And that's all I gots to say about that."}
{"text":"Love this place.   It is almost a weekly staple in my home.   My daughter and I have loved this place for years.   The food is consistently good.   I just hope the prices don't keep going up."}
{"text":"Had a great time at lunch with my man! Tried this wonderful Gyro restaurant, family owned. So fun and they made us feel like part of their family. Food was wonderful and dessert...well if there is heaven on earth I found it!! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was super excited for this place as I looove middle eastern food. I got the gyro plate with rice and I was disappointed. The meat was dry and the the rice was just like any other regular rice. Everything also tastes like garlic. Way too overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Food was good but I'm glad I ordered to go. The environment is anything but relaxing. Some crazy/angry lady (I assume was in charge?) really likes to micromanage her employees. She literally stopped paying attention to my order to stare at a waitress then yell at her to clean a table. She even waited until the table was cleared before she got back to my order. It was super weird. And that was after yelling at the cook staff for talking too loud. As she herself yelled from across the restaurant...? Food took forever even though it was not at all busy."}
{"text":"Words cannot fully explain what an awful experience I had at my most recent visit to this establishment. Having been here atleast 20 times, I convinced a couple of my friends to try this place for lunch. After we placed our order, the waitress confirmed our selections. When the food arrived, one of the meals was incorrect (the order was for a chicken dish, but the meal received was beef). One bite of the dish was enough for my friend to know he would not be able to eat it, so we sent it back and asked for something different. At this point I was not at all upset, as a former server I know that mistakes happen. After we ate, the waitress informed us that we would still be charged for the incorrect order as she insisted that sh¬¨e brought what we ordered. We could hear her arguing with the chef in Spanish about how she wrote the order down right, and that everything was our fault. I am fluent in Spanish, so I understood every insulting word that she said. We decided to speak with the owner, as we did not feel that we should have to pay for both the incorrect order AND the correct order (which by the way was terrible). I have never actually seen a restaurant enforce such a policy. The owner informed us that the mistake was by the server, and that he would remove it from the bill but she would have to pay for it herself. I told him that was not acceptable as mistakes happen. He continued to argue that she would have to pay, he even went so far as to call her stupid for making such a mistake on a slow day and that she needed to pay for her mistakes. His attitude was unbelievable, and his blatant disrespect for his female employees was beyond words. The owner makes the guy from the episode of Kitchen Nightmares featuring Amy's Baking Company look reasonable. If you are in the mood for Middle-Eastern food, try Haji-Baba, Curry Corner, or Sahara."}
{"text":"Ate a Classic Gyro w/fries. OMG! If you want to go into a food coma, eat the whole thing. Totally delish, would definitely go again."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mediterranean food in the valley! So far I have had chicken shawarma and the gyro plate and both were delicious. As well, don't forget to order Greek fries, they are absolutely amazing! 
Though it doesn't stop there. The service is run by a mom and daughter, and they are absolutely the best. They make it seem like you are their home and are extremely inviting. 
I will certainly be coming back and become a regular."}
{"text":"The best Greek restaurant in Gilbert.I have came here over 8 years And never had anything I  didn't like!!Great service super friendly like eating at home with family.."}
{"text":"So good! Had the small Greek salad with gyro meat and hommus cup for lunch. The dressing on the Greek salad is outstanding. Better than any other Greek restaurants Greek dressing by far. They also put beets on their salad, which I love beets. The hommus was very good as well. Probably one of my top 2 favorite hommuses ever. My server, whom I am assuming is the owner, is extremely friendly. I don't live in the area, but will be back for lunch when in the area for work."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in the Phoenix metro area! The staff is awesome and I don't leave the restaurant without eating one or two pieces of baklava"}
{"text":"Very clean place ! Food was excellent n fresh .. ordered philly chicken was the best i have eaten ! Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Love it! Awesome hummus.. Great gyro meat. Never disappointed. Family who owns it is always kind and gracious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is slow. Menu says no substitutions and they're serious about that. Pricey given the fast food atmosphere. I won't dine here again."}
{"text":"I tried the shwarma and the chicken was tough and not edible. Service was bad and the owner in the counter was terribly rude. Never going back again."}
{"text":"Tried the lunch buffet, but as one of Euro descent, the cabbage rolls and other dishes did not live up to expectations. I consider myself to be somewhat of a baklava aficionado, and would say it is not nearly as good as the baklava at Chicago's Number One Gyro over in Apache Junction. It is a quaint restaurant, but you may be better off ordering a gyro to-go. 

A big positive for the place is that they have good service and friendly workers."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing food did I say amazing.. I will say it's  caf√© style inside so maybe not for romantic date night but you can always take the amazing food to go for romantic candlelight dinner at home ..it's nice and clean inside. Family owned and ran. Mom makes all the desserts.... The Greek frys  are amazing too...."}
{"text":"Just got the chicken shawarma plate with rice and hommus....so flavorful and well prepared! Will be back"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan on my first visit. Falafel deluxe is the best!"}
{"text":"I've had better pizza at gas stations. It was $1.99 a slice between 2 PM and 9 PM. Playing with a card? Be prepared to fork over an extra $.50. Have a takeout order? Be prepared to be handed a paper plate with nothing to cover it, not even foil."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is euphoric. Very tantalizing. Food is amazing. It's like the flavors are dancing on my tongue with every bite. Service is very friendly and on point. Get the kibbeh!"}
{"text":"I really love this place and find myself thinking about their delicious food here and there. The fries- amazing! The chicken shawarma- bomb diggity! The gyro- yum! The pita- guess what? DELICIOUS.

I used to like Pita Jungle. Then I met Phoenicia. The only reason it isn't five stars is the seating is kind of awkward."}
{"text":"Came here for Father's Day dinner. I order the chicken shawarma entree with rice and hummus as my sides. I got garlic sauce with my meal but asked for a side of taziki sauce as well. The food was delicious! The service was amazing! The place is a small cute area but the food was so well presented that it made it seem way better! One of the people with us is vegan, one gluten free, and one vegetarian so going to a Greek restaurant was a perfect fit for all of us. The waiter was very accommodating to everyone's needs. They did it with a smile as well. I was very pleased with my experience here! I would definitely go back. I will recommend it to other people without a doubt as well! Very happy about my very radiantly pleasant   Experience!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for many years (it's walking distance from work), and I eat here frequently. The food is delicious. I'm more of a baba ghanouj guy than a hummus guy and it's a standout here: creamy with a nice smoky flavor.  The gyros is good and the schwarma is excellent.

The service can be spotty at times, mostly newer servers. The old hands are fantastic, though."}
{"text":"Good food; and not a bad price for the ample amount received. Try the gyros plate (best we had around) and the Greek fries (topped with feta cheese and some tasty sauce). Also, quick service with unlimited refills on fountain beverages and smiles; although the hummus was not great but good. We would eat there again."}
{"text":"As advertised, this is a Mediterranean (Greek, mostly) restaurant.  Reasonably diverse menu including all the classic Greek dishes. 

Our group ordered lentil soup, the gyros plate, the shwarma plate, and an entree salad. All the food was good.  The garlic dipping sauce was really nice.  Portions were reasonable.  Service was very friendly.

We also tried two of the baclavas (they have several varieties from different regions of the Mediterranean)."}
{"text":"I am the antithesis of a vegetarian, but I tried their falafel today and it is AMAZING. Such great flavor. I agree with others that it is a bit dry, but the accompanying sauce does the trick. And that garlic sauce--whoa, I'm definitely not getting any love any time soon.

I also tried the \"hommus deluxe\" with chicken today. That's the creamiest hummus I've ever had. Wow, so flavorful and the chicken was grilled perfectly. My girlfriend and I shared and still had extra falafel and hummus. 

I usually get a gyro pita boat. I've never had a gyro with so much meat...a definite plus for me. Wait, I lie, the chicken schwarma at Pita Jungle is comparable in size and filling. Maybe I'll go there tomorrow.

Back to the matter at hand. This place is mighty tasty and cheap to boot. The service, in my experience, has always been good, if not great. 

And for being so close to Mill, you have to try this place because it a) isn't a chain, b) doesn't smell like sewer, and c) isn't consistently packed and loud."}
{"text":"Came just to get some baklava and other sweets. They have a great variety to choose from. All of the ones I got were delicious. Light and flaky and sweet. Just right. The food looks amazing as well and would love to come back to try."}
{"text":"The owner of the place is so mean, he doesn't know how to say hi neither to act politely, he was talking in the phone while I am standing in front of him for at least five minutes waiting to be helped without even apologizing and when he finished his call he treated me with no respect not even a smile. In term of food, I received my order late and it came cold. Anyway, it is going to be my last time to this place."}
{"text":"Irony: huge line of people waiting to eat at the pizza joint next door while there are plenty of tables available at the much better restaurant next door.

That's right.  Phoenicia is a better restaurant than Sal's Gilbert Pizza.  Much better and the service is better too.

The most delicious, hot and fresh gyros in the valley.  Bar none.  

They give you bigger, hotter chunks of meat than any gyro I've had.. And I've had many.  I was impressed with their meat quality and consistent freshness.  

The Greek fries are incredible too.  They look kinda gross, but don't let that deter you.  It's like feta cheese w ranch over fries... But better.  

The kids loved the Nutella dessert and everything was well priced.  The also have a ton of fresh made in house Greek pastries that folks were snatching up.  They looked and smelled amazing too.

So don't be a nincompoop and wait in a long ass line next door when you can sit right down here and get better grub.  

Seriously let's help this business thrive, they deserve it."}
{"text":"It was amazing ! Very generous portions with great delicious quality food and service . The staff was very helpful with advice for a first timer. Everything recommended was incredible ."}
{"text":"A place less desirable than others.....the chicken lacked flavor and the selections suggested for us to try were not the better of thier options.  Thier bread was none compared to naan or other pita options. It does have a good reputation and in all likelihood, I may consider it again however I would suggest passing on the trio appetizer and the Philly sandwich which lacked in substance."}
{"text":"Come here.  Order the Chicken Shawarma WITH EXTRA GARLIC SAUCE and I garauntee you will not be disappointed.  The vegetarian sampler is also a great choice for starters (more than enough for three).

Whoever did their decorating had a rare talent for turning stomachs (they apparantly really like the SUNS purple and yellow uniforms), but this is completely counteracted upon by the great food and the warm local feel of the place in general.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"I firmly believe they have the best hummus around. I know people love Pita Jungle's hummus, but that is nothing compared to this creamy goodness! I don't think have ever had hummus so creamy and smooth. I have eaten here a few times and it has been delicious, but honestly I prefer just stopping in on my way home and picking up a container of hummus and homemade arabic pita bread (also super delicious and soft!). I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of our family's favorite restaurants! Love everything we've tried- but can never pass up on the hummus, Greek fries or pistachio baklava! Yum! Our waiter recognizes us and calls us \"Family\"! Great food, good prices, happy and friendly place to go. So, go already!"}
{"text":"Great Little Spot With Great Food & Nice Family Owned Service

This is a tasty little gem of a restaurant. I really like the family that owns it, they were all very friendly the mother and daughters all went out of their way to be legitimately and genuinely nice to all the customers in the building.

We got the Chicken Shawarma and also a plate of beef Shawarma. The sauces and the rice and meats were all very exceptional. Great flavor out of this family owned gem.

The inside as they sleep decorated and clean with a good amount of seating, but I would imagine on a Friday or Saturday night this place would probably be a little bit packed.

Is it anyone who follows my reviews knows five stars for me is a pretty huge compliment. So stop by and check this family owned business out and have some delicious food and tell them Vladimir sent to you."}
{"text":"I have not ever had a bad meal here. I always enjoy the atmosphere and food. I usually stick to the same meal each time:  the Gyro platter eith hummus and tabouli.   Soo yummy and the portions are huge!!"}
{"text":"A small restaurant with reliably good food and generous portions. We always enjoy it."}
{"text":"I've come here since I was a child, but mostly because it's right next to the mosque and out of habit. Food is generally good but sometimes lacking in freshness. Service can be very trying, with a higher-than-expected pricing on top."}
{"text":"Food was super plain. I ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich and Greek salad.. And it literally tasted like plain chicken breast with a bunch of garlic sauce in a pita.. Salad was ok too.. Didn't have the usual toppings for a Greek salad. Majorly disappointed. The service was good and everyone is friendly but for me it's all about the food."}
{"text":"Got the shawarma, it was good, but wasnt ask glorious as Biaz Market. Fries were plain jane, wish it was a bit seasoned... goes a long way. The hummas and lamb was pretty glorious... isnt as sandy as most places make it (hummas). Great service and good selection of baklava."}
{"text":"I was craving a gyro and while my pregnant daughter opted for a chicken wing spot (to go) nearby, the rest of us enjoyed a quick dinner at Phoenicia Grill.   It was ok.  I like alot of things in my gyro salad.  While plenty green it was, it lacked the speckles of other vegetables I enjoy in a salad.   The dressing was \"ok\".  Having checked in via Yelp gave us a 10% discount on the bill so that was a plus!  I may be back since I know of no other gyro place in the area!  :)"}
{"text":"I was excited to get dolmades from here because they're one of the only places in town that make them without tomato. However, it's caked in so much oil that I got sick."}
{"text":"Amazing food and Ryan provides amazing service. One of my favorite spots - Shawarma combo with rice and hummus"}
{"text":"Favorite Greek place! There's not many good ones around Gilbert so this is a gem! Tiny restaurant though, so best if you can eat it elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Foodies, beware!  The owner will overcharge you if he can.  He charged me $25.70 for two chicken schwarma sandwiches, a side of fries and a side of rice.  (We drank water.)  When I pointed out that the sandwiches were only $6 on the menu (in fact the \"combo\" that included the side and drink was only $9, he said :well, you didn't order a drink\" and then said \"ok\" and changed the total to $24.70.  Though I wanted to question it again I just went ahead and paid it since I was with a guest.  (It's only a few bucks, right?)   When I requested a receipt, he muttered \"oh my god\" under his breath.  Yes, oh my god,  I wasn't expecting bad customer service and a lack of scruples as part of my lunch combo.  Watch your wallet carefully at this place."}
{"text":"I've been to Phoenicia Cafe 4-5 times since moving to Gilbert. I really like both the food and friendly service. I try something different each time. Today, I went with their cilantro hummus as an appetizer and the Greek salad with gyro meat.  
This place has yet to disappoint.  Always consistently good.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the service is personable from the manager. I love to support local spots like this where you know you're going to get unbeatable food for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch today with a Yelp coupon. The atmosphere is pretty good for a Greek restaurant. The waitress was super friendly and attentive.  The servings were very generous. I am having to dock them one star for the quality of the Gyros meat. 

The Yelp coupon did not help too much. It was buy 1 sandwich get one 1/2 price.
We bought 2 combos with fries and drinks. So after adding up everything a la carte and getting 1/2 price on 1 sandwich it worked out to the same price as the regular combo price."}
{"text":"Love Phoenicia Cafe! This is our go to Greek place, love the food and the employees. The gyro, chicken kabob and hummus are our favorites. Typically get takeout when I don't feel like cooking - always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"This place has the best gyros in town. They don't skimp on the meat either. Kinda expensive, but I will be going back."}
{"text":"Took my staffs here for lunch since they're not very adventurous and I'd like them to try something new. It was a big hit. Everyone has leftover since the portions are huge! One guy who doesn't like hummus licked the appetizer plate. The one who didn't like any kind of sauce on his fries loved the Greek fries. Enough said. Service was good as the owner is working the tables herself. Seems to have a lot of regular as she greeted them by name. Amazing food!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here, and I have to say I really LOVE the bakery.  Samosas are delish and the baklava just oozes with sugary goodness. 

The restaurant food on the other hand was a little less impressive.  I got the shish kafta boat, grape leaves, and zaatar.  While the flavors were good, there was nothing particularly special about them.  The meat is well seasoned though :)  overall the atmosphere is very casual and relaxed, but the food comes out slow.

Also a fun place to check out is the grocery store inside!  Lots of spices and foreign snacks."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover.  Unimpressive exterior and modest interior.  But it's well maintained and clean. The food more than makes up for the decor.  We had beef and chicken shwarma, basmati rice, hummus, pita, tztzki"}
{"text":"I was craving Greek food so my boyfriend and I decided to go check out this place because it was close to our home. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and we sat down. I was excited to try their buffet but we went for dinner and the buffet is only for  lunch. So we i got the mixed kaftah which had some beef and lamb with my two choice of sides( hummus and rice). My boyfriend for the cilantro chicken with hummus and rice. Both dishes were good but I felt like I could get this kind of food at any other Greek restaurant. The food didn't stand out and maybe it what's we ordered but it was ok. I'll come back and try the lunch buffet and see if the variety is better. The service was good but we felt our food took forever to come out."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and Sylvia (I believe to be the owner) was super friendly, even calling us by our first names.  I had the Shish combo. It's definitely enough for two meals, so second half sitting my fridge for tomorrow.  The pastacio baklava is delicious with lots of nuts. The place was packed and completely understaffed, so it was understandable that it took some time to pay the bill.  I don't think I'll have room for dinner.  The prices are reasonable considering it really is two meals.  I will absolutely be going back in the near future."}
{"text":"I got the gyro and the green fries \"great fries + feta cheese & their ranch\" - which I would recommend to anyone with a mouth.  The service was good, but not great.  The gyro meat was tender, and tasty, and I will definitely be back to try other items on my international food bucket list."}
{"text":"Best arabic food. I visited this place while on was on a business trip to Phoenix. A buddy of mine said to try it and boy was I glad we did. Shawarma beef and chicken tasted like it came straight from the home land. Very tender and full of flavor. Wish I lived closer to this place. I would eat there every day."}
{"text":"This place has been consistently good.. Their lamb was off the charts moist and tender... Their seasoning is exceptional and their menu is priced very reasonable.. Service is courteous and fast.. Friday's are busy which is a good sign, so be a little patient.. I'd like to give them 5 stars but I think the owners need to re-do their sitting area to accommodate guests better. The big center booth needs to go.  I think they need to look at their lay out a little closer.. But no worries.. I'll be back, the food  is really great.."}
{"text":"All of the bad reviews are because of overcharging and scamming you. IT'S TRUE.

The beef schwarma was good. And the service was decent and maybe somewhat slow for a tiny place.

The thing that I didn't like was that they SECRETLY OVER CHARGE YOU. So the beef schwarma is $5.99 and the total bill came out to be $7.79 which meant they charged me $1.80 for tax. It wasn't only me... it was my other friends as well. That's a 23% tax onto my order. Like WTF???

I didn't say anything because my friend said that's what they always do. And when I read all of the other negative reviews on here, it's the same story. Well, they are not doing that to me again. Peace out! :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today after driving past the place  for years and wondering if it was any good. I drove around the restaurant hoping there might be a free parking lot for customers,  but that wasn't the case,  I had to meter park. Once I found the entrance I was promptly greeted and given a menu, which was helpful because I'd never been here and wasn't familiar with all of the dishes.  Once my order was placed I took a look around the small market and was surprised at how many spices they carried,  they also sold couscous for cheaper than any market I've been to.  I wasn't quite sure where I was supposed to pick up my order,  no one said anything so that was a bit confusing. 

The food itself turned out very delicious.  I adored the crispy falafel and the gyro meat was super tender and flavorful.  They included a bag with three Pitas which seemed a little odd. The hummus was also nice and creamy and they gave me lots of it. I feel the prices were a touch higher than they should have been,  but maybe ill just order less next time:)"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite places!! The gyro meat is the best I've ever had and there are a few different options for someone who isn't sure. Best menu item is definitely the gyro plate- comes with two sides and pita bread- about $9. They do charge a 20% on all dine ins, so definitely be aware of that and that's why I don't do any tip on the receipt after I pay. But a good option is ordering an entree or one of the sandwiches (gyro, schwarma, falafel) to go. Everything is very quick here so you can walk in and order to go and be out within 10 minutes for sure."}
{"text":"The key to good Mediterian starts with fluffy rice.  From there the ability to bring out the many flovors in each item so you are made happy to be lucky enough to have chosen the resturant =smile.  
Today we wore big smiles at the Phoenicia.   Starting with a hearty welcome and ending with a drive-by of their desert area.   We were too full for desert.  A great experience."}
{"text":"Loved the food here before but was so disappointed yesterday when I went in for the dinner buffet and they said they don't have it. It is still on their website. I drove all the way from queen creek for it :-( please update your website."}
{"text":"so this will be the second 3-star review I've left for this place. The food took way too long to come out, but was really quite good. In my last review, I noted that the staff were obnoxious, and the same was true this time. A person at my table ordered a dessert and asked for the topping to be on the side, but when the brought it out, the topping was on the dessert. We sent it back, and they refused to remake it, and brought it back out with most of the topping just scraped off. I think the waitress was simply not listening when the order was taken, but they way they handled it was just ridiculous, they really pressured us to take the dessert and pay for it anyway even though it wasn't what was requested. I wanted to like this place because of the food, but the way the staff act, it's just not worth the frustration."}
{"text":"This is a somewhat fast-food style Greek and Mediterranean restaurant, but the food quality is top-notch.  We've been coming here for years and find the food quality is very consistent, always great, and the portions are very generous.  Entree prices range from $7 to $11, with the $11 meals containing multiple meats and sides.

One particular dish, the Chicken Shawarma, is impressive in how tasty the chicken is.  The combo platter offers up a very nicely spiced beef option.  The rice is exceptional here."}
{"text":"Fair prices meals with large portions. Each dish includes fresh ingredients with a friendly staff. Try the chicken schwarma!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the prices are good, the vibes are chill. Both the waitresses that have served me there have been super nice. They'll take a minute to follow a small conversation if you strike it and they are quite hospitable. I usually order the chicken shwarma, which is quite tasty, but yesterday I went with a dollar zatar bread pie, some Turkish coffee and a little baklava to close. The bread pie is delicious, I think that the price is fair for what it is, though I must acknowledge that other places would definitely take 3 dollars for it, so kudos to Phoenicia for keeping it student friendly! The Turkish coffee was delicious and had me buzzed halfway down my tiny espresso cup. Needless to say, baklava was good, a perfect way to end my day. 

The place has nice air conditioning and calming lighting, excellent free wifi and a p good location of you are willing to pay a bit for parking.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place. I have seen it around several times, but never stopped in. I went with a group of friends. Have to say it wasn't bad at all. Prices were fair and the staff was friendly. Iced tea was nothing special, but then again, they are not an iced tea place. Greek fries are the way to go. We will be back for sure! Great find in the heart of Gilbert."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years, and while most restaurants start out great and then slack in their quality after they hook you. Not this place!!!!  Their  phone seems to get fresher, and the quality actually seems to keep climbing, I'm so impressed. I had a regular gyro this time the meat was perfectly cooked with no dry edges like most gyro places have. I don't like to yelp unless something is seriously noteworthy. I feel like everybody who likes Greek food needed to know they finally have the best place. If that isn't enough, the staff is awesome and very accommodating. Salt of the earth. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I didn't expect to write this kind of review, the ratings all made me think I was in for a good meal.  It wasn't bad, but I have to say I have had far better.  The food was bland. I had the chicken schwarma (forgive spelling errors :) plate, falafel, and greek salad.  The greek salad was good, better than the rest of the food, but $7 (too expensive in my opinion).  The places that come to mind that I think are far better are Greek wraps, king gyro, the greek corner, shish kabob house, even some of the food at pita jungle beats the meal we had here.  I wasn't impressed with the bakava either. I can't say I will go back, I just wasn't impressed at all.  I do have to say though, the server was nice, it was clean... Nothing \"wrong\" with it, but the food."}
{"text":"Since we have been back in AZ for a few months, I wanted to find some restaurants close by our home that we haven't heard of.  A Yelp search led me to this little place on Gilbert Rd near Warner.  It is sort of hidden behind all the chain restaurants in the area.

We walked into an empty restaurant, and greeted by a young girl.  She answered questions about the menu items and we chose the vegetarian platter and kafta kabob entree.  The vegetarian comes with hummus, babaganoush, stuffed grape leaves, tabouli and 2 falafel as well as plenty of pita.  The kafta kabab entree came with 2 pieces of kafta and plenty of rice.  It was all delicious!  

They have traditional Greek fare, and a little \"market\" refrigerator where they sell hummus and various pita items.  

There was another couple who came in during our visit, but other than that it was dead.  Maybe it picks up over the weekend, but with such delicious greek food, I don't know why it isn't more busy!  I know the decor kind of set me back.  It is kind of out dated and cheesy.  But the food is worth a try.  I was expecting a sit down and order place, this is not the case.  The menu is on a light up board on the wall, and you pay @ the cashier who then brings out the food to your table.  Kind of like Greek fast food HA."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but I just wish someone told me the gyro plate only came with meat. I was hoping for tomatoes and onions with it. I don't want to just eat a plate of meat but it was very good. Also, I think it's ridiculous to get charged to use a debit card. Their prices are already steep and I wish their pitas were made in house rather than receiving a generic bag of mediocre pita bread. I'll give it another try but these are areas I think need to be fixed!"}
{"text":"Wow! This was an amazing meal for just a random stop before a movie. I've lived near here for a few years and always had it on my list of places to try but no one else I was with was ever into it. Tonight I was alone so I dropped by. 

The servers are friendly and helpful to an unusual degree (and easy on the eyes too). I had the gyros plate with hummus and tabouli. Tabouli can be hit or miss for me and this is a definite hit. So good and not to much of any one thing. 

Seriously the best Mediterranean place I've ever eaten at, and again, the service was impressive. 

I'll be back"}
{"text":"Delicious! Try the cilantro chicken it's to die for!!   Also they have the moistest felafel you will ever find in the US. Excellent prices and the best service anywhere,I swear to it.  Also if you check in on Yelp you will receive a coupon for 50% off an order."}
{"text":"We had never been here before but decided to try it on a Friday night. First of all the seating was awful.  They have two large doors so every time one of them opened there was a gust of cold air. Worse than that though was the service. We sat for a very long time before even getting water. Once they finally took our order, we waited and waited until people started to get their food that ordered long after us. It was about 50 minutes of waiting before getting our food. Since it wasn't a fancy meal it just seemed like an abnormal amount of time to wait. The food was delicious which is the only reason I gave two stars. They lost any future business from us unfortunately."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch. I moved to Gilbert from L.A. a few months back and was craving Greek food and found this place on yelp. It was amazingly good. I got the gyros with the side of Greek fries and hummus. Also got one of the best pieces of baklava ever. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Greek salad with gyro meat. The meat was too salty for my liking, and I tried to balance it out with the blandness of the salad  (I used the dressing sparingly to save on calories). Waiter was great about me asking for more tomatoes, as my salad only came with 2 thin slices. 

Sadly had to knock off the 2 stars because my mouth was feeling so parched half way through the salad because of how salty the gyro was. It was almost difficult to eat because my mouth felt like sand paper :(

That aside, everyone seemed to go nuts for the dessert, especially the baklava. I was too stuffed to have any, but if I get to come back again, I'll be sure to leave some room. I've also heard good things about the Greek fries, but once again, didn't get a chance to try."}
{"text":"This place works with a delivery system that my work gets food from, and I have always been hesitant to try it! I'm not big at eating outside the box, but today I thought I would give it a try! I ordered the Shish Kabob and the filet was amazing! I was worried it wouldn't be as tender as a traditional filet, but I was proven wrong. The meat was tender, and seasoned very well. You get to choose from the mild seasoning or the spicy, and I went with the spicy, and the kick was just right! Plus, there was a hint of sweet that hits you right toward the end! My sides were the rice and the fries. Who doesn't love fries? They event sent a side of ketchup that I didn't order, and I was happy they did! The rice was a little bland for my liking but was decent over all. The pita included was fresh, which you rarely get doing takeout. I will definitely be back, and would with out a doubt recommend to my friends! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Been there often, but today had the Quzi. Some of the most tender lamb I've ever eaten. The staff are always friendly, too. Great hummus."}
{"text":"I went here on a tip from a friend. I love Greek food. Everything I tried was unbelievably good. From the Greek Fries to the Phoenician Philly Sandwich. Cilantro hummus had just the right amount of heat. Companion had the Chicken Kabob it was great. The Baklava was absolutely amazing. Highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. I drove all the way from North Phoenix to eat here and will definitely make the drive regularly. All the staff was extremely friendly. Especially the owner and her son. Great people ."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this gem! I had the greek fries and a greek salad w/ gyro meat. Everything was great! If I had to choose one thing to eat for the rest of my life it would be those greek fries, holy cow they are soooo good! My friend paid cash and accidentally gave our waiter an extra $20 bill and he actually came back and asked if she meant to do that. I thought that was really cool of him! Kudos to this place. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Food was good. Got a little fatty towards the end though. Also a little too sour,but I guess I'm not too used to mediteranean/greek food. I really liked the basilian rice and the lamb and meats though. The hummus was also really good. Good service. Could maybw add more meats though. I had the phoenician combo."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for greek food. Gyro's are delicious & their greek frys are pretty scrumptious. They also throw down a buffet which is pretty awesome when feeding finicky kids. The owners are good people, very friendly & always a pleasure to speak with while dining in. Thanks for all the great meals!"}
{"text":"They have the best hummas in the world! Get extra pita to go with it. We usually call in & get get take out. We love the gyro plate & Greek salad and one order is plenty for two.  The baklava is house made and wonderful."}
{"text":"This place loses out due to poor customer service, which is a shame, because the food is good.  it didn't used to always be this way.  It used to be good food with a friendly, attentive staff, but then they changed management. 

Our first experience with the new management and staff wasn't great.  Service was slow, but we figured they must be busy so we let it slide.  Then we bought stuff from the market.  They have two registers side-by-side--one for the market purchases and one for the restaurant bills. We went to the restaurant register so we could pay for our market purchases along with our meal.  First of all, we got ignored and had several customers taken before us, despite the fact that we were there first.  When they finally decided to acknowledge us, they told us we couldn't pay at that register since we had a market purchase.  Rather than just sliding over to the next register and taking care of the purchase there, they made us wait in line again.  Finally we checked out...and were overcharged.  We didn't realize this until we got home and by then it wasn't worth going back. 

We decided to give them another chance and went back a few weeks later.  This time the service was even more slow. 15 minutes passed before we even got our water.  45 minutes later our food still hadn't arrived.  The waitress kept speeding by our table and ignoring us.  We snarfed our food down fast when it finally got there since we had to get back, and went to pay.  Long wait again as we got ignored for other customers who came after us, and then they overcharged us.  Again.  Fortunately we caught it this time.  They hastily made the correction, without so much as an apology.  Rather, they acted annoyed that we were holding them up.  How about getting it right the first time if you don't want to do it again? 

So that was it.  I don't think we'll be going back.  It's really a shame, because the food is  delicious and this used to be one of our favorite places.  It's just a shame that the new staff sucks.  I can get good food elsewhere and not be treated like garbage and overcharged."}
{"text":"Best food ever two female waitresses served us and kept a smile the whole time educating us novices on the Middle eastern eatery.  I have to say they were awesome along with superb food yum yum yum and you have to get a baklava today on the way out for later too!"}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting from out of town and were on a time constraint. 

I called in and asked if we could order ahead. The individual on the phone said it was not possible and that we had to order when we got there or order to go. I thought to myself I could order to go and if there was seating when we arrived, we could just eat there.

When we arrived there was definitely enough seating,  but the manager very rudely told us we could not eat the food there. We did not require any service, but  offered to tip as usual. My wife is pregnant and we just needed a place to sit and eat their food for a few minutes. The lady, who I believe is the manager, was very short with me and pretty much told me to take the food and get out.

I understand that the restaurant has certain regulations they try to follow,  but as a business owner, I know there has to be an attempt to accomodate customers."}
{"text":"The food is good, but obviously not very memorable. The only thing I do remember is the creepy guy staring at me the entire time while I ate my vegetarian platter. The mango lassi was pretty tasty. 

Definitely a good place for lunch and the outside seating is great for those nice Arizona winter days."}
{"text":"Shawarma fantastic!

I have eaten here about once a week for 3 years. Wonderful food and staff!"}
{"text":"This little Mediterranean place is walking distance from the ASU campus. A virtual oasis during the hot day that my friend decided to visit the campus. Name me a dining venue in the Phoenix metro area that's not air conditioned? Ha! That's what I thought.

My friend ordered the shish kabob pita and I the shish kafta. I'm used to Mediterranean food so I liked the food I ordered. My friend, on the other hand, found the taste of his food \"unusual\" and \"different\". I guess the lamb didn't taste like the meats he's used to.

On a lark, I tried the imported Vimto grape soda. It was pretty good! A lot better than the American grape soda we had. I wanted to order another one but alas, they charged by the can.

If I ever come back here, I have to try their desserts. I wanted to, but I couldn't convince my friend to share it with me. I also have to try the appetizers but we were so hungry that we couldn't wait to have a prelude to lunch.

One more thing, for those that need this info. I don't know how halal this place is; but I didn't see or smell pork anywhere. I doubt there is any in this place, but ask, just in case. Okay?

Drink a Vimto for me, okay Yelpers?"}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've ever had in my life. I would recommend this place to anyone and and will make this my only place I get Greek food from. Everything at this place tastes amazing."}
{"text":"I used to visit more often when I lived closer. 

Very yummy. 

Gyros are overstuffed and delicious. 
Pro-tip ask for fries to be cooked well done or else the will be mushy. Unless you like mushy fries.

Good stuff."}
{"text":"Another of our favorites.  The service is quick and friendly and the food is great! Definitely recommend the lentil soup, the Gyros plate, the tabbouleh, and the Shwerma, but really everything we have tried there has been great so far, so try something new!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing the catered my office luncheon and the set up prefect. The delivery person was awesome. The lady who took my order was super sweet! The hummus was the best I have ever had. The entire staff loved it!! The baklava made fresh was over the top. Highly recommend this place. You guys are awesome."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Greek/Mediterranean food in town! Great place for a quick lunch. Try the hummus -it's out of this world!"}
{"text":"I love mediterranean food.  A lot.  But for some reason I'd never quite found myself at the Phoenicia before today.  A friend invited me, I was excited to try something new so we made a go of it.

I had the gyros pita, which was pretty good.  Not the best ever, not the best in Phoenix metro. But it was still good.  My friend went with the Lentil soup and the vegetarian platter (Tabouleh, Hummus and Babaganoush served with a generous pile of pita bread).  I tried the hummus and babganoush and I'm more partial to Cafe Istanbul on both counts but to each their own.  

The place was clean, I liked the yellow and purple tables a lot and the service was decent.  They have fresh squeezed carrot juice which I enjoyed quite a bit.  The water however was unfiltered tap water and awful in the way that all Tempe tap water is consistently awful."}
{"text":"I stopped here after Lunch for some Baklava.......well........
That was by far the WORST Baklava I've ever eaten.

I was so disappointed, after reading the reviews I was expecting something that would knock my socks off.

I ordered 1 piece of walnut and 1 piece of pistachio. They looked perfect (see pics) 

Boy are looks deceiving, I bit into soaking sticky wet Goosh, it was so soggy and stale at the same time, I literally spit it out along with the next bite of the pistachio piece, both not worthy of swallowing, it was that bad!

I guess I'm spoiled, nobody makes Baklava better than my Mom or my Gramps, I need to make a trip home.

1 star for their Baklava, I'll have to go back to rate the food,maybe."}
{"text":"Phoenicia Grill is a special place. The food is excellent-wonderful shish kebab, fantastic gyros, awesome tabbouleh, and the best hummus that you will find. The staff at Phoenicia Grill are all very friendly, and it is a joy to find such a wonderful place to dine with excellent customer service. One of my favorite places to dine in Phoenix. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"NO STAR OR NEGATIVE! 

Nobody could believe the most miserable experience in Phoenicia Cafe II at Gilbert location. We waited for more than 30 minutes and got told that the kitchen staff did not even have our order ticket!! WE GOT NOTHING TO EAT AFTER WAITING FOR OVER 30 MINUTES!

My family entered the restaurant around 6:10 pm yesterday (01/11/2018). Due to dinner time, the restaurant was a little busy, two waiters were serving about 7 tables. One waiter is with blond curls; the other waiter is with dark brown hair. Once we sat down at the table in front of the kitchen station, we ordered one Ultimate Combo, one Kid's meal with chicken fingers, one mango mix shake and one dessert. The waiter with blond curls did not write down anything, just repeated the items we ordered, and reminded us that Ultimate Combo was big enough for two of us. Then he walked away. 

Per my observation, the procedures are that the waiter takes the order, put the order into computer, kitchen staff print out order details at their station after submitting. During this period of time, Blond-curls waiter checked the tickets on the kitchen station from time to time, hence we assumed that everything should be fine with our order. 

After 15 minutes, my husband could not know why mango mix shake took such a long time to make. Blond-curls waiter could not remember he had a mango mix shake at all until my husband asked about it. When the shake was being made, blond-curls waiter told us that there were some take-out orders that he needed to handle in the back, hope we could understand. Five minutes later, the shake finally came.

That was another 15-minute wait after we finished the shake. My daughter started to complain that she was starving, yes, we had been waiting for about 30 minutes. At this point of time, I saw that 2 kitchen staff seemed available, so I asked them whether they could make Kid's meal with chicken fingers for my daughter. But kitchen staff replied, \"We don't see your ticket.\" During this conversation, the waiter with dark brown hair came to ask what was going on, but blond-curls waiter was checking out a customer for his take-out orders. Two kitchen staff understood our frustration, and asked what our kid's meal was, apparently, they did not see ticket with a kid's meal at all. 

Well, it had been over 30 minutes we got nothing to eat, and it was not our fault at all. Blond-curls waiter did not come to us or kitchen station to try to solve the issue at all, still doing the take-out orders. He did not even apologize to us. If this restaurant does not welcome us or blond-curls waiter does not want to service us, please let us know at the very first beginning once we came into the restaurant, NO NEED TO WASTE OUR 30 MINUTES! We will let everybody know our extremely unpleasant experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Location is great, food is tasty! I had chicken shwarma sandwich. Good flavor, wish it had more onion and hummus or tzatziki. Overall, though, delicious! Gyro meat also tasted good. The patio is a little small, but great location for people watching! Good place. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have gone to the Phoenician since I was a lowly ASU student just looking for some good Middle Eastern grub. I appreciate their tzatziki on top of their gyro salad. It is a perfect blend of juicy and savory lamb, along with feta, cucumbers, lettuce, onions and tomatoes, finely chopped and topped with olive oil and vinegar. It is my favorite dish there. The plates are also excellent, and come with rice and vegetables, but are more for dinner fare. They have recently added lunch combos with fries and a drink to any pita for an additional $2.00, but they haven't posted it on the menu. You can still order it, though! 

I will keep coming back for the flavors and the prices, especially when Yelp has a deal like they one they have now!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! I would highly recommend it. I will definitely be back to Phoenicia!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING  in every way !
Oyr first visit and we had a Gyro combo plate, (Greek Fries are awesome) the Chicken Shwarma and Lamb Chops: PLUS home made Baklava(made by owners Mom and her secret recipe) all far exceeded expectations.
Staff was top notch...Ryan was our server and took great care, but the rest of the staff checked in and asked if we were good without being overbearing, including the young man whom I believe was the owner... He just wanted to make sure everything was up to our standards. 
It was.
You will NOT be disappointed, my only issue is that we hadn't visited sooner.
We will make up for lost time.

disclaimer: i/we do not know, work for or are related to the family that owns/runs this establishment, this is an honest and real review."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place:) 

This was the first restaurant in the Phoenix area that my fiance and I tried when we moved from Chicago in Oct '09. I guess it's only fitting that it's my first review on Yelp as well. 

I think Phoenicia has just about everything I look for in a restaurant: 
1. NOT a chain (and by chain, I mean 10+ locations--I am well aware they have a second location in Tempe which is equally awesome) 
2. Great lunch specials (I can get gyros, salad, hummus, and pita bread for $5.99 - my personal favorite) 
3. Family owned (I found out the owners are from my home state of MI, yay, not that it makes the food better, it just makes me like them more) 
4. Consistently great food (especially the gyros and falafels - can't go wrong there) 
5. Interesting beverages - I had a pineapple soda the second time I visited, need to try it again sometime.... 

I have yet to venture far from my beloved gyros and falafel. The lamb shank has been catching my eye for some time now. It's on my list the next time I go for dinner...."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very impressive. They have 4 different options for baklava, their menu is filled with options, and the service was excellent. I need to go back for their garlic dip and chicken shawarma. I ordered the chicken but got gyro instead. No problem because my dad was hungry. The beef shawarma was on point, and I was full after the hummus as well so I am super happy and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Easily the best Mediterranean food I've ever had! My husband and I both got the Chicken Shwarma and Gyro combo plates. He got rice and salad, I got Greek fries and rice. Everything was amazing. Our 11.5 month old loved the gyro meat and she typically only likes chicken! The service was amazing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you squint at just the right angle while sitting on the patio of Phoenicia, you can almost see the ocean. This is perhaps the most relaxing place to sit and have lunch around Tempe.  The white patio is shaded by sail-like blue awnings which reminds you of that great trip to Greece you wish you had actually taken.  The only drawback for tall peeps is that the seating is a little lower than normal, tiled benches and cushioned stools, which leave me straining under my now heavier weight ever time I get up to leave, but... maybe I should just stay.

I have had many of the dishes on the menu here and have been satisfied on every occasion.  This is properly prepared and portioned middle-eastern food, cooked with great skill and care.  The flavors don't pop for me on every dish, but that doesn't keep me from coming back on an almost weekly basis.

Favorite dishes here are the veggie platter, the fatoosh salad and the labneh plate.  This was one of the first places I've ordered labneh and I am now a serious strained yogurt fan.  It might not sound very appetizing, but labneh is seriously good snack food and a great change from the typical hummus and baba routine.  Think thick, semi-sour cream cheese served with pita and olives.  Definitely Mediterranean, a nice snack while in your cabana.

I love the two candies they have by the register here: Turkish Delight and Cotton Candy.  The Cotton Candy is like a little spun sugar pile that resembles more of something you'd find under your bed than a dessert, but that makes all the more fun to eat as you walk out the door and return to the desert."}
{"text":"Good but not great. I have grown up eating authentic Mediterranean food so when I found this place so close to home I was excited. The restaurant itself has a good environment. The service was very exceptional and the food was good. I found the hummus to be bland as with the rice. The chicken schwarma and gyro meat was very good. The standout of our dining experience was the waitress who was very attentive and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Mmmmm greek fries. I guess I always ended talking about the fries but I'm sorry I can't help it - they were SO good.

I had the chicken shawarma and it was delicious, though the fries were definitely my favorite part. The service was ok...there were a few times that we really wanted to waitress' attention to ask for napkins or get a to-go box and it was really hard to get, but for the most part a good experience. 

Next time I really want to try the hummus - I've heard good things about it."}
{"text":"Very family friendly cafe, I remember being a young boy attending elementary school right across the street from where the cafe is located. I remember the kids menu options were so great and satisfying that I always wanted to come back for more. Now, nearly 13 years later!, this cafe is still providing amazing service and i still have that warm feeling every time i dine there. Its amazing what good food and great atmosphere can do to a person!"}
{"text":"Came here on a random whim for the first time a couple of weeks ago with a friend. We were talking about greek fries (translation: I was talking about greek fries) and said friend had never experienced them before. After a quick little yelp search for greek fries, I found Phoenicia!

Holy greek fries. This is the BEST I have ever had anywhere. I could eat them all day, everyday until I get so big that I can't have my own airline seat anymore. Thank God for the gym, y'all.

Aside from the all encompassing greek fires, the falafel is crispy and hecka GOOD.

I have now been here three time sin the last week and a half and I am bringing everyone I know with me.

Oh, and the hummus. WOW. The super hot boyfriend doesn't even like hummus usually and he thought this was amazing. They make it in house and can sell you a small container to take home for $6. We purchased the classic (which is what they serve with their dishes), but I heard mention of a jalepeno/cilantro one that I am definitely going back for when I get through my first container.

The staff is incredibly friendly and you will meet them all at some point during your meal. They all come over and ask if everything is great and offer to refill your water glass. Love this type of teamwork!

Oh, and side note, they are closed on Mondays. Don't do what I did and get yourself all worked up for greek fries and be disappointed when you show up on a Monday and walk away greek-fry-less."}
{"text":"I hope more people are frequenting this place since I was last there.  It's tucked away in a strip plaza (shockingly)!  The interior is cutesy and bright while upbeat music is playing.  They have a small outdoor seating area and some booths and tables inside.  The food is cooked fresh for you (so there will be a short wait).  It is set up like Sauce where you order at the cashier area and they bring the food to you.  I simply love their gyros!  It's relatively quick but always fresh and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was awful. Took 46 minutes from when we bought our food for it to get to our table. Don't go on Saturday nights. Save yourself and drive a few more miles and go to the one in Chandler."}
{"text":"I have been here twice with my bf because he likes the food here. The food is okay to my standard but I do love the server; she is great. When we went to the front counter to pay, the owner punched in the prices and the register showed a price of $32ish but then our credit card was charged $38ish. And on top of it we left $5 tip in cash at the table for the waitress. 

Long story short we came back the second time and ordered less food this time; however we were charged the same price and left another $5 tip in cash. We left puzzled and took us a car ride home to realized that he charged us 15% service fee without saying anything to us!

Needless to say we won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"After having a baby, we got away from going here for a while.  We went back a couple of weeks ago and the food has gotten even better!  The hummus and the gyros meat are the best we have ever had!  The buffet is a thing of the past, but I'm glad because the food is a lot better when it is made to order.  The only thing I wish is that they would consider making fresh pitas instead of packaged.  The pitas are warm and tasty, but fresh home made pitas would be a nice twist that would further set this place apart."}
{"text":"New favorite Mediterranean restaurant! The hummus was my favorite part and the pita was very fresh. I got chicken shawarma which was well cooked and flavorful. The walnut baklava was also delicious. Servers were kind and welcoming and helped us pick out some of their best dishes. If you are a fan of Mediterranean food or want to try it for the first time, check this place out. The prices are also reasonable and you may get a coupon when you check in here."}
{"text":"These guys do a lot of things right--from their perfectly marinated and grilled kabobs, to their unique and addicting Greek fries, to the delicate and scrumptious almond chocolate baklava--there are so many reasons to frequent Phoenicia.  Their service is always friendly and the restaurant is always clean.  This is one of my favorite places in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Good, solid food and service.  We have been here many times and keep returning.  Parking can be tricky here since it is near ASU.  Bring quarters or your credit card for the parking meter."}
{"text":"Falafel is the best in the valley! Hummus, you can't go wrong they are all great. The only reason I'm doing 4 stars is as AMAZING as they are... I wish the prices were just a tad bit lower. Lunch usually runs me close to 30 then add tip. I support local businesses, I get it isn't going to be cheap, you do get premium food for sure... just wish it could be a tad bit less so I can frequent this restaurant more often."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! I went in craving some Greek food and was definitely satisfied! The customer service is friendly and you feel right at home. I definitely will be back. Those Greek fries"}
{"text":"Edit: The waiter is no longer working here. We have since returned and had a wonderful experience.

Review: My family and I have frequented Phoenicia for years (since they opened) and never had an issue. We have always gotten along with the owner, Sylvia, and the staff that have worked there. But tonight we had a completely different experience than we normally have.

My mother, father and I walked in and tried to find a place to sit - the place was crowded, like normal. The head waiter (who recognizes us every time we go in) told us he would clear off a table for us and asked us to wait outside. We waited for about 10 minutes and then another family walked in and they seated that family before us.

My father walked inside and politely told the waiter that we would come back another time. The waiter asked him why and my father told him that we were just going to go and that it was okay. The waiter (I kid you not) then yelled at my father, \"What do you expect? All of our tables are full, man!\" I heard this all the way from outside. My mother and I looked through the window as multiple people turned to watch. My father then said, \"Don't worry about it, we're leaving\".

A waitress came outside and told my mother and I that they had a table ready for us - my mother politely said that we were just going to leave because the waiter was rude. The waitress tried to get us to come inside again, but my mother repeated that we wanted to go because the waiter was rude. The waitress let out a long sigh, threw her hand up in the air, and stormed back inside.

We left. Sorry, Sylvia, you are a wonderful person - we miss seeing your face every day! I'm sorry to have to report such a poor experience. I hope we can fix this!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. Recommend the gyro plate. Amazing hummus. Hidden gem. Great take out. Baklava to go. Yum."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mediterranean food in the valley. Huge portions for the price. The gyro and swarms combo are our favorite. Also recommend the roasted lamb hummus. Phoenicia is awesome!"}
{"text":"When ever I have guests or just with a college, this place works PERFECT! now they have a sweet treat sections and if you like to try a bit more, their mini market is diverse enough to start. People is nice and the food tastes really good!"}
{"text":"We finally checked this place out after driving by a few times and reading reviews and so on. We ordered take so we could watch football at home. Nothing too hard to make, 2 gyro plates, Greek fries and 2 baklava. First off we didn't get the baklava, so who knows how that tastes. They had two giant pans of it that looked good. Now to the food. Be forewarned the gyro meat is salty. No need to add anything extra there. And it does not come with a lick of toppings like tomatoes or onions. It's just meat. The taziki to put on top was bland at best. Tasted like plain yogurt. The rice side tasted like plain, unseasoned rice. Pretty bad. I got the tabouli salad which was alright, but I wouldn't go back for it. My wife had the rice and hummus. The hummus was plain and plain it was. That was a perfect name for it. Plain, devoid of flavor, texture or anything appetizing. The Greek fries were just French fries with some, believe it or not, flavorless feta piled on. I didn't know feta could be so bland. Overall, we won't be back. There are just too many great options out there to get Greek food that is full of flavor for the same price if not cheaper. Unfortunately that whole strip will be a giant Sal's Gilbert Pizza at this rate. That's a good place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Ate here for the first time with the family tonight. Small place but very good prices and extremely good food. The service was great but my only complaint was they could have used a third waiter as the place was full (sat night 6pm) and the two waiters were stretched too thin. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I came here with my \"brown boy\", as he is so affectionately called, to grab a quick bite to eat after classes.  Still not sure why the boy invited me out to lunch if he wasn't hungry, but I was starving so I was down.  I ended up getting the something kafta and he got the spanakopita.  The food arrived promptly and the kafta was huge!  It came with two huge pieces of ground lamb, hummus, garlic sauce, and pita.  The spanakopita was also a huge for an appetizer.  I didn't have any of the spanakopita because I was so busy enjoying my meal.  The lamb was perfectly seasoned and was a great match for the addicting garlic sauce and the hummus.  Walked out of here paying less than $15.  Definitely a great meal at an amazing price!  I can see why it's packed with college students

If you are getting dessert, I would skip over the jellied treats and go for the baklava.  Nothing can beat baklava."}
{"text":"I enjoy Mediterranean Food, but I've been told that I don't really know what's authentic (rolls eyes) but I think this place is pretty darn good. However, I've been told that if someone were not to like exotic flavors or tanginess, this might not be a the place.

Flavors are rich and very exotic, always fragrant.
The rice cooked right, flavored well and not sticky and soggy or hard and powdery.
The meat tender (can be a touch dry on the occasion) and spiced well.
The service tends to be polite and very accommodating; though once the guy seemed to be having a bad day. (drinks, serve yourself)
The atmosphere, nothing special and not romantic, but unique.

I usually have something from the list below:
hummus with pita chips
Quzi (seasoned lamb shank over rice)
Gyros Plate
Shish Kafta

BTW, there is a market attached to this restaurant, it's an experience to browse through and maybe even pick something unique to bring home."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat here in AZ.  The food is always amazingly delicious and the staff are always super friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff, great prices in a small casual environment. We had the shawarma combo, garden salad and baba ghanoush...all wonderful and plenty of food. The guys working there are really friendly so ask them if you have questions or want recommendations. Everything is made from scratch...the gyros were my fav. Next time, I'll be trying the homemade baklava."}
{"text":"Good, but no Sahara.

The falafel is a little dry.  The garlic sauce is good.  I'd never noticed the service being particularly bad, but whatever.  I like being able to sit around and not feel the wait staff hovering when I eat.  Call me unpatriotic if you must.  Cheap lunch if you don't mind garlic breath all the live long day (and usually I don't)."}
{"text":"I used to go here when I lived in Tempe and went to ASU and now that I'm back down there again I have returned to it. I went the other day and got the chicken schwarma pita with a side salad and it was great. A pretty big meal, and really delicious. It was pretty crowded when we went but the service was still good and it was pretty quick. You have to go pay in the little market thats attached to the restaurant which isn't my favorite because there can be a line. Also, last time we went somehow two chicken pitas added up to like 30 dollars which seemed wrong so hopefully that doesn't happen again. Be sure to bring change for the parking outside because it's all metered."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Customer service was even better. We had four employees check on us repeatedly. Awesome experience."}
{"text":"First time eating here! Lady was very pleasant and Greek fries are to die for! Definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"We went there couple of days ago at Sunday. The place was empty and we were cordially greeted. The food was okay, not the best. Next, tried the Baklava. Its also average. We have eaten better ones in the valley. Its an expensive place compared to other places like it."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the service was so abysmally awful that I won't ever go back.  Food came out at different times including one of my side orders which came out half through my meal and only after I asked.

Apparently Not a single dish we ordered  came with tzaziki and it's a charge to get that or any other dips... that's if you can get service.  

I had to flag down the waitress just to get my check.  It's a small place with plenty of staff.   No excuse for such bad service.  By the way we watched two other tables also struggle with the service so we weren't alone.

Disappointed..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and it's always great! Big serving sizes, delicious gyro, and friendly staff. Definitely a place to check out"}
{"text":"Been looking for a good gyro in the area. The Phoenicia Cafe had the best gyro I've had since moving here! The hummas was also delicious. Very quick service. We will be back."}
{"text":"Once again great service! 
Clean restaurant and helpful staff! 

This will continue to be our number one choice for Gyros. 

Yes there is a poke stop near by for those of you trying to catch them all and eat like a champ ! 

Haven't had a bad experience yet.. keep up the great work ! 

Thank you Ryan for being so out going and welcoming !"}
{"text":"Food is always excellent but I am giving a review on customer service. Ryan is EXTREMELY rude and was arguing with me over the phone and even asked me if I wanted to pull up a menu online because he had no clue what I was talking
about. My boyfriend went to pick up the food and said he was treating the cooks like crap too. That's none of my business but I will not be returning if you cannot have proper manners when talking to a customer."}
{"text":"An exceptional value!  I have been meaning to try this place for a while, and I am glad I finally got around to it!  I found this restaurant to be a perfect combination of fast food and casual dining.  There are nice, clean tables and a pleasant atmosphere.  Our waiter was very competent and friendly.  The food was not exceptionally high quality, but it was GOOD and it was filling and large.  I ate a falafel pita boat wrap, which was delicious and large for about $4.  This place is perfect for students on a budget, but the food is very good too!"}
{"text":"just had lunch here today and ordered the shoarma combo (chicken and gyros) and it was delish!!! the chicken was season just the way i like it: not overly seasoned and not too strong, just right!!! the gyros was nice and moist... i ordered it with the hommus as a side and it was served with plenty of pita!!! i definetly did not leave hungry! especially since we also got baklava for dessert which was amazing!!!!

i will be back here very shortly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently great! The food is fantastic. The service is awesome. The staff is very friendly. The hummus is the absolute best! You have to try the Greek Fries. Top them with leftover gyro meat. Yummy. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Eaten here numerous times. Had take out numerous times too. Always yummy Middle Eastern food. The owners are very nice. My experience has always been positive with the service.
If you go on a day when they have freshly made couscous, do try it - it's very delicious! So flavorful!! 
Also their Chicken Fatoush Salad is mmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. The staff is so great. Everything is fresh and just plain great. Can't say enough good good things about This place. 
When you come here you MUST try the Labne. 
It is out of this world. 
If you are in the Phoenix area you must make the trip to Gilbert and come to Phoenicia. 
Hands down one of my families favorite places."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I stopped in for the breakfast buffet (only because of the signs and we were hungry).  I'm NOT a fan of Greek food and this experience did not change my mind.  Although what I did eat was ok, it wasn't the best.  Nothing on the buffet was labeled so I had no idea what I was eating.  I guess my favorite part of this experience was the fresh made toast and the fact that they had peanut butter (creamy and crunchy), which most restaurants don't offer.  Service was marginal, refills were always offered, it appeared to be clean and the music was not over the top."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan! BIG time. This was some seriously delicious experience. There are a lot of Mediterranean/Middle Eastern places out there but hanging a few pictures on the walls and putting Hummus on the menu does not automatically make it so. This place is for real. Coming from NYC and Brooklyn i had ate at my fair share of this kinda places and this one surely keeps up the mark. 

Think of a college town joint and prices with Scottsdale taste. Service was great too - Never annoying but we could see the guy glancing at our table often to note if something was needed. They even let us keep the car in their lot as we went on exploring neighborhood. 

Not a damn thing bad about this place. 
Why not 5 stars? I think it could be a bit more authentic and a bit less cheesy. But in reality it does not matter when food shows up. 

\"I like\""}
{"text":"Wow! I just received the best service I have ever had. Anywhere. We wanted to celebrate a great Christmas concert last night and my son remembered how much he loved the food at Phoenicia. It was quite a drive but we thought it would be worth it. We arrived 5 minutes before closing. My son and husband lingered outside the door not wanting to make the employees work late. But I was determined since my son had specifically requested this place. We determined to to take it to go and hurry in and out. Ryan took our order and reassured us repeatedly that he wasn't in a hurry and to take our time. He talked us into staying and eating in. He made a special lemonade for my son and we sat down and are the best meal I have had in months. The hummus and tabouli were to die for! My son enjoyed the baklava for the first time ever! Ryan continued to make us feel welcome. 

Although I enjoyed the Phoenicia before, it has now become a destination! Thank you, Ryan!"}
{"text":"Definitely some of the better Mediterranean food I've had. If a place has good hummus and garlic sauce, then they have my attention. If the food is fresh and full of flavor, they get the rest of my attention. Phoenicia fulfilled all of these needs and then some. Oh, and their pita bread was soft and warm, a definite plus. They also had a small hot foods/dessert area which was nice; got some pretty good samosas to go. In addition, they have a little market area in the rest of the store. Got me some falafel mix and imported Kinder chocolates!"}
{"text":"The food are delicious, the service was awesome. Servers were very welcoming and happy that you're there. I got the beef Kabob entree dish and I love it. Wished there was more vegetables on there though. The rice are delicious, the hummus were yummy, and the beef are tender. Will come back to try more food. Prices are very reasonable!!"}
{"text":"The Greek Fries are to die for. I've only come once, but everything I have had is amazing. Will definitely be back. I need some more Greek Fries in my life."}
{"text":"The food: Their bachlavav (spell check) is perfection. It is made fresh daily by the owner. My favorite entree is the gyro plate. Plus the tziki sauce is to die for. Their hummus- outstanding. Even their rice is on another level. They said they make it with truffle oil. I've never had anything there that I don't like and I'm a VERY picky eater. 

The staff: The owner and her daughters work there and they are all super sweet. The other staff we have encountered were also superb. The customer service is fantastic and it's clear they have really put their heart and soul into that place."}
{"text":"Quaint old cafe style restaurant booming with flavor. The Basmati Rice is scrumptious!  I couldn't decide between the beef or chicken ~ after asking our waitress she said the chicken kabobs are more popular. Then chicken it is! So tender, moist and spot on! Highly recommend the chicken kabobs. 

I ordered a side dish of the couscous simply to try it. I had the sauce put on the side. I'm so glad I did because I did not care for it at all. Sadly, they used the same liquid to cook the couscous so I could not get away from the flavor. 

The hubster ordered sliced chicken in a tomato based sauce with red and green peppers. He totally enjoyed every bite. For an appetizer we ordered the chickpea hommus with pita bread. The \"hommus\", as they call it, was smooth with a definite chickpea taste and just the right amount of garlic. The disappointment was in the pita bread. It was not fresh, homemade pita bread you would expect at an authentic Mediterranean restaurant, it was store bought! Totally surprised us ~ and not in a good way."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and couldn't resist the temptation when I saw a yelp deal for Phoenicia.  I'm a huge fan of this style of food and they do everything very well here.

The two times I have come here my gf and I split some ginormous sampler for 2 (or more realistically - 4).  You get to try almost everything and it is all very good.  We took 2 full large containers home as leftover, and leave stuffed for around $30 when adding in our iced teas.  The yelp deal dropped that down considerably.  But, I have paid full price for it before, and I will again, it was just icing on the cake I got it on sale.  

I don't have to send a lot of time describing the food, most people know the main stuff.  It is all quite tasty here and the service is always top notch.  Meat is moist, and everything has good flavor.  What more are we looking for, right?  There is some high quality places in the area and I think Phoenicia holds its own.  I literally drive past 5-10 of them to get here, that must say something."}
{"text":"Really good food, authentic atmosphere. Service is a bit awkward, but not bad for a family run restaurant."}
{"text":"The gyros are really good and filling although I've had better. Their proportions are decent and I have yet to try more of their items. The service is really nice and the restaurant is also clean. Can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"Phoenicia had a great staff and the food was good. My biggest complaint is they only had Pepsi products!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is much different in terms of appearance than the Phoenicia in Gilbert on Warner & Gilbert, but owned by the same family.  The food is also a bit different.  We've only been here once for take out.  My husband always orders the same thing - Gyro Plate with Basmati Rice and Greek Fries, whether at either restaurants, so he knows the taste that he likes.

The Tempe location makes the food somewhat different.  Still good, but not the same as the Gilbert location.  I still give this a 5 star because the food still tasted good, just different.  Not sure why.  

Not sure if we'll come back because my husband didn't prefer the taste as the Tempe location, but for us, the Gilbert location is great and we keep going back there.  Service for take out was great.  Very nice location in the downtown Tempe area."}
{"text":"I have to give our waiter credit yesterday for doing so well with our order that I totally messed up.  Despite telling him the wrong thing TWICE, he was able to get the order correct.  Apparently I was having a lot of brain farts this evening.

Normally we bring our children, but they were in advanced karate class and so my husband and I got to go on a short dinner date.  Love these with him.  

The food came really fast, which maybe was a little too fast.  But it tasted great as normal.  We both had the Gyro Plate.  My husband always gets Greek fries (this is an extra charge) and rice.  I got rice & hummus.  They make great hummus.  I like the salad, too, but wasn't in the mood for salad.

Ate some of my meal, but I had a lot left to take home.  The portions are HUGE and really could serve as 3 meals for me.  A part of it was my husband's lunch the next day.  The waiter convinced me to get Pistachio Baklava and this was simply divine.  It's been quite a long time since I had baklava and I enjoyed every bite.

My husband scarfed up 90% of his dinner (I had about 30% of my dinner) so he was stuffed and couldn't eat any baklava.  Too bad.  More for me.  I wanted to lick the plate, but that would have been bad manners.

We used the Entertainment Coupon with 20% off our bill.  Gave the waiter extra for tip, like 33%.  It was a great experience!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I eat here on a regular basis as it is within walking distance to the office. It's one of the better options for lunch and it's one of those places you start craving after a while. I pretty much always go for the same thing: the gyro pita boat with fries. My colleagues are big fans of the Greek fries. I've only gotten them once and while they are very good it's not something I want to spend the extra calories on very often. 

It's a family owned business and we are nearly always served by a family member. The food comes out quickly, and is always fresh. With 3 or 4 new buildings going up here I hope for my own selfish reasons this place doesn't get overly crowded in the near future!"}
{"text":"The food is spot on and I cannot say enough about how their service is above and beyond the call of duty! Sylvia (the owner) remembers my name and food order. She is extremely genuine and warm. Checks up to see how everything is going and always makes small talk with me when she has a minute. Ryan is a product of Sylvia and brings the same level of service. He is always smiling, enthusiastic and energetic. Very genuine as well, remembers my name and goes out of his way to make conversation. I am a customer for life!!!"}
{"text":"They were very accommodating here.  We had a group of 30 come in unexpectedly, and they had no problem putting all the tables together and splitting all of the bills.  One thing that was a little off was our waitress was very sick.  She even told us she was but that there was no one else to take her place so she had to work.  Hmmmm....please don't sneeze on my food.  I got the Shish Kabob for $5.75 (Tender cubes of Marinated Lamb Grilled and served with Vegetable, Pickles, & Tangy Garlic Sauce).  It wasn't enough food for me but I think I eat more than the average person.  It was really good and the pitas looked incredible, loaded with tons of meat.  Everyone in our group was pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"This place is great! Silvia is the owner is is almost always there to make sure your food and your service is great.  The chicken shwarma, Gyro combo plate and the sampler are all amazing."}
{"text":"Always good quality Greek & Mediterranean Cuisine with plenty of choices for entrees, appetizers, sides, salads, and sandwiches. The Greek Fries, Gyros, Hummus Platter and Baklava are among my favorites."}
{"text":"This gem is hidden next to Sal's pizza. Friday comes and the kids demand pizza.  Sal's is packed, and we convince them to go to Phoenicia, with promises of baklava for dessert.  We've been using this ploy for years, because Phoenicia is amazing. 

The lamb shank is easily my favorite dish of any restaurant in Gilbert. The rest of the menu, top notch. Sure, I can't get a beer, and the service is sometimes slow, but I know I'm never leaving disappointed."}
{"text":"I used to like this place, but the flavor in the food is quite lacking.  Mediterranean, Arabic, Greek... whatever you want to call it, I think the options are the typical but I wish they would use more flavors in the meats, rice, and salad without ranch... ranch dressing with this type of food down plays it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Tonight we had the hummus deluxe and chicken kabob salad and as usual it was delicious. Best hummus in town and the Greek fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"My sales director and I went in here for a quick biz lunch the other day. Good vibe walking in and friendly staff who shouted out seating instructions to us. Fast wi-fi was a bonus. Waitress (maybe manager or owner)  was a crazy col lady and helped us through the order process and some special lamb items we wanted ordered on the side. Gave us a free soup that was a surprise and tasty. My friend really liked the shrimp we ordered but it was a bit sweet for me. We also ordered lamb kabobs which he also liked but were a bit on the well side for me - tasty nonetheless. Gave it the extra star because we left with the feeling it's a cool place and wanting to come back and order something else. Cool BBQ store next door too."}
{"text":"Great food. Agree with other reviewers. One of the best little med grills in the east valley. 

Try their lunch buffet--amazing choices for very fair price. Several great deserts!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. We happened to be waited on by someone that was their first day back in three years. One of us ordered a sandwich came that comes with fries but the server thought they changed the menu and debated if it came with fries, after we pointed out under \"Combo\" it comes with fries. It took about 1/2 hour for us to get our food and the place was half full at best. When my food came I asked for ketchup. When the server came towards our table with the ketchup he got distracted by another table and gave them the ketchup. SO I just went to a table where people just left and got my own. I got the Gyro with Greek Fries. I used every condiment on the table to give it any kind of taste, and I almost never use salt or pepper. After the long wait I was already famished so I just ate it. The others at the table had their own complaints. The gal who was the manager or maybe owner was nice and told us we would get a 10% discount. (Thank you). The server couldn't get our bills sorted out when we went to pay. And the server still didn't take off the discount. He showed me on my receipt where what days you get 15% discount (Tues-Wed-Thurs), discounts. It is Tuesday and I didn't get that discount. So I didn't get the regular 15% nor the 10% for the service.
I told them I don't think I'll be coming back. They asked if it was that bad, I said unfortunately yes. I told him I had to use every condiment on the table for some flavor. I also mentioned that their bathroom smelled like a sewer drain and that at least had some smell (which was so bad I could actually taste), which is more than I could say about the food.

Despite my friend that took us there and said the one in Tempe is awesome and despite all the great reviews on here... I don't think I/we'll be back. Maybe we just went on an off day...
Sorry"}
{"text":"Been going here for almost 4 years....LOVE their new \"sweet\" section, best baklava, cashew is the best!

Service is awesome....sometimes I come with a friend sometimes with my husband but the waitstaff always recognize us and know what we order!  Food is delish, hummus is fantastic, I've had the kafta, falafal....hubby has had the lamb....everything is always 5 star....

Really good place, parking isn't too bad, but bring change because its metered....

Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Phoenicia and I was very impressed. I ordered the mixed Kafta with a side of rice. I have never been a big fan of hummus, but the employee asked if I wanted to do half rice and half hummus for $1.50. I said yes - and it was very good! A little garlicky - which matched the garlic sauce brought out with the plate. If you plan on doing any kissing either avoid that sauce or make sure your date has some as well - it was very strong (but good). 
The plate with the added hummus and water was $13. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place and the staff was friendly and efficient. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this Greek place!  The gyros are awesome! Glad to have found it and close to home.  Very friendly service."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food in the valley. Very authentic and delicious. Comfortable atmosphere and we love our server! Best gyros meat I have ever had. We have been coming here since they opened 11 years ago."}
{"text":"This place is always delicious!!! I've been eating at their Tempe location for almost 20 years and just visited the Gilbert location for the first time. The food is always consistently good. They serve good sized portions for an affordable price. Their gyro meat is the best you'll find in Arizona.  Definitely a must try if you have never been."}
{"text":"The chicken burger is surprising good. I also ordered the onion rings which is pretty fresh made. The place is quiet at Wed. afternoon and you get 25% off with the receipt you had last time. Not a bad deal at all. Wife ordered the Gyro, it comes with lots meat. It's enough for us to take home as snack. 

The buffet don't looks so attractive to me anyway, but I would like to try other burgers."}
{"text":"It seems like we are not only customers who've been asked for secret \"gratitude\" at the very last second. There is literally an 15 min lasting paragraph I'd place here but I know Yelp wouldn't allow that long. So, instead I'll share the hit points of that conversation. 

As we were walking out, I noticed the difference between the bill and what's written at the register. I told him what this was about and he explained with \"service\" fee which was 15%. I told him that this is exactly why I don't like coming here because you hideously charge people and get away with it. He said that he is doing it because nobody give tips to service people and he needs to take care of them. Plus, \"they are cleaning after we left, they serving and they are doing all this stuff so service fee is a must\". Then following that statement, I felt aggravated and I told him about how he is doing this off the record and nobody really knows how much you are making off of those charges and whether he is sharing it with his employees and isn't that what the waitress are hired for so why are you still asking people to pay off for it?. Then he swore and showed me some receipts and numbers written on them which he claims they are stating the tips whoever has worked that day. 

Long story short, he then wanted to give our money back because he doesn't wanna argue. I said no and if there is anyone who deserves that is the waitress and she needs to get it so give it directly to her.  We then left. 

I don't say anything to their food and maybe that's the only reason I go there from time to time. Plus, the waitresses are generally nice and caring and really eager to establish good and long lasting relationships with the customers, they tend to know their customers in that regard. But this guy's attitude about making more and undeserved money is off the chart. In order to claim what he is doing is right; he can even manipulate the truth and suggest that 90% of the restaurants are doing the same thing. 

I'm not sure how much he is aware of how strategic location he is being at but, if you are a decent business man with high moral values because of your religion, ethnicity and background, you must act accordingly and prioritize to leave a good trademark of your professionalism and understanding of running a good restaurant; rather than a guy who is after people's extra money by charging them \"secretly\" and under the name of \"gratitude\". More interestingly, this issue has been there for almost months (as far as some reviews support that) and yet he seems ok with it. 

I always prefer to be on the solution side at the end rather than getting stuck with problem. So, here is my solution;  You can spend some money on a professional designed (not hand written which you are accustomed to), visible and clear banner which inform your customers about your \"gratitude\" policy. 

So that, people don't give tips \"twice\" (I'm aware you don't care but still it is ethically wrong), don't think you are trying to avoid paying taxes of what you are making \"really\" and don't worry that you are one of those individuals who has some strong signs of misrepresentation of your background which consist of ethnic, religion and moral aspects. 

I think that way, you very well find a way to share that delicious food with expanded network of loyal, generous (giving tips directly to waitress type) and frequently visiting customers."}
{"text":"I really have to say, their food was knock-out good here. I ordered the mixed Kefta, and it knocked my socks off. Seriously.

You wouldn't know it just by walking by this place. It's in an office-park-ish type of area, and it just looks like your typical Gyro joint. Most people inside will be eating gyros, fries, and burgers, and I'm sure that's alright. But you know better than that. You're not afraid to dish out a few extra bucks and risk mispronouncing something off of a menu. That's right, my friend. YOU... are my peoples.

I ordered my habitual Turkish coffee, and as soon as the lady brought it to me she had read the grinds in it. Now THAT is some service. Everyone there was extremely friendly, and I had a genuinely enjoyable lunch. And the minced lamb was just perfect. Seriously, it was fucking perfect. Juicy with a PERFECT crisp on the outside. Their hummus had a nice little decoration as well, and it was TAAAAY-STAY!!!

It'd be easy to overlook this place. You shouldn't."}
{"text":"Incredible food. We had the couscous Phoenicia. Gyros were delicious. Eat here. The chef came out and talked to us. Family place."}
{"text":"Good food, big portions and decent prices.  Got the ultimate combo plate to share and it was enough for 2 people.  Service was not very good and could use some improvement."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. The price was really good for the amount of food I got. The food was really fresh and delicious. The staff was super nice. Wish I would have tried this place sooner."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place with my friend who goes here all the time. Finally! I've been to quite a few Greek restaurants around this area and this by far is the BEST. Mom and Pop run business, the owner was super friendly. I ordered the Gyro platter with a choice of 2 sides which I choose the salad and Tabouli. My platter was excellent, the portions were huge and juicy, OMG soooo good. My only complaint is that the pitta could be more generous enough and softer. I tried their famous Greek Fries with Ranch and Feta, very very tasty, but personally just not a fan of all that stuff on my fries, but they were good! Service excellent, food very good, cost is a little more but worth it!"}
{"text":"New to the Gilbert area, I was taken to the Phoencia Greek Cafe for lunch by one of their regulars who turned me on to the out of this world cilantro and jalapeno hummus for starters. 

Silvia, the owner seated us. Took our order. Served us. Cashiered our bill. She was everywhere, greeting people by name, scurrying from one task to the next with the grace and speed of a young gazelle. (Later I learned she is the chef as well!) Always a smile on her face, a true smile that beamed of thankfulness for us having lunch in her vibrant little cafe. She has such good energy and a grateful peacefulness about her even if she was multitasking like an Olympian. Once you've eaten here, she'll know you by name, remember what you like and always serve you with a genuine smile!

Oh the menu. So many choices. I tried the gyro, as for me, it's a true test of Greek authenticity. It was the best gyro I had ever had. What a treasure! I can't wait to go back and try other dishes and their spanakopita. We took four flavors of baklava back to the office for an afternoon snack and believe me, it's something you have try---you will fall in love and crave more. 

This place is a find. I love supporting small businesses that have their act together and something special to offer to the community. If you love Greek food, visit Sylvia's place. You'll be a regular in no time."}
{"text":"The guy at the counter is the worst racist who treats brown skinned people in a frustrating and disrespectful manner. I stood there and silently noticed his behavior and decided never to go to this shitty place. Stay away from such worst humans and businesses ran by such shitty losers!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place! Too bad I live in Tucson, the have it all! Cheap, great portions, clean bathroom, a small inside market,  and one of the best service I have ever had, the waitress was the friendliest one ever!"}
{"text":"If you love quality food, you have to check this place out! 
My coworker and I stopped for lunch and the food was so fresh and the flavored with there spiced  were the best I've had.
The owner was ringing us up and she was so sweet, her daughter was our waitress and she was so nice and polite. 
I cannot wait to get back here in a month just so I can eat here again. 
You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food was just ok. My friend had a chicken shawarma plate. She liked the rice the most. I had a gyro sandwich which was ok. We both felt that our food was missing flavor.
I gave more stars because the service was good and the staff was friendly. The restaurant itself was cute and cozy."}
{"text":"Very tasty. I had a Greek salad with gyros meat and my husband had a gyro plate. Quite tasty. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The chicken shwarma, kaftta and hommus deluxe are excellent. The garlic sauce is so good I want to drink it. Can you smell my breath from here?
Awesome staff and a cool store in the back. Try the cookies and the baklava, they're delicious."}
{"text":"The food was good, but I took issue with the manager's treatment of me as a customer.  I checked in via the Yelp app, which had an offer of buy one sandwich get one 50% off.  The waitress checked that it would be accepted and I ordered accordingly.  When it came to pay, the manager said they hadn't accepted that coupon for a year and blamed Yelp for not updating their system.  I wouldn't readily go back to a place that doesn't serve their customers in a more friendly way, especially since I was given the impression up front that the coupon would have been accepted."}
{"text":"BEWARE OF THIS PLACE. The owner is a big miser and a thief.  He placed a gratitude charge of 20 percent on my bills. Nowhere on the menu or anywhere on the store is it mentioned that he will charge it. No matter how the food is, the guy is such a miser and is actually robbing people. Stay away from this place. Who knows how he cooks the  food, knowing is such a big Scrooge."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 gyros to go and the order was made pretty quickly. The business didn't appear to be busy inside. The staff was nice and the Gyros had good proportions . Prices were okay- 3 gyros were 22 dollars ."}
{"text":"my first time here and the food is okay, nothing to rave about but if you're craving mediterranean then this place will suffice. i'm sitting in the store now writing this review since the customer service is less than stellar. it's about 1:50pm so i probably just missed the lunch rush and the crew seems tired. the lady with glasses looks to be the one in charge but is somewhat rude. she just tossed my order on the table and walked away without saying a word then reached over my food to grab my full sriracha bottle to exchange it with another full bottle? still no words and she just walked away... okay well. hopefully they do a better job the next time i have a craving and don't feel like driving farther for mediterranean."}
{"text":"Some of the best hummus I've ever had, hands down. And I've eaten a loooot of hummus. I love this place because everyone here is so sweet to everyone and treats you as though you are a part of their family. Try the falafel deluxe platter and you have a meal for two days; not to mention, it makes for some delicious leftovers."}
{"text":"Food was good but pricey for what it is.  When i went in the place was a mess.  They must have had a huge crowd come in as the tables were all messy, food and napkins on the floor as if the tazmanian devil just rolled through.  Anyhow, I had the chicken kabobs and a small side of humus with drink and it was $21.  Like i said, i was happy with the food but not for that price.  I purchased the coupon off yelp ($10 for $20) to try it out so I cant complain that much but based on that i wont go back to spend $21 on lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Incredible service! We had the gyro and the chicken Schwarma. The feta fries were also outstanding. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I have walked past this place for so many years and never went in. Doesn't look like much from the outside and the \"specials\" signs are for pizza and stuff. Didn't think they served legit Mediterranean food. Hummus is amazina, kafta is amazing, gyro is huge, lamb kabob plate is super filling. Everything I have tried has been good and I plan to work my way through the entire menu."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time with a coworker. 

Lunch hour was SUPEr busy, and now I know why! It was delicious!

She ahd the falafel boat, which she says is her favorite.

I had the hummus deluxe, which when I received it, was HUGE! I couldn't even finish it off! I got a peice of baklava on our way out, and we both picked up some delicious greek chocolate goodies for the office communal snack desk. My baklava was probably the best I've had. Definitely fresh and made on site. 

Didn't get a chance to browse through the mini market they have, but I will DEFINITELY be going back to do so!"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch several times and it's always delicious, affordable, and the service is friendly. The kafta sandwich with hummus is tasty and filling, yet doesn't put me to sleep. That is more than I can say for my dick."}
{"text":"Awful! I ordered the hoomus falafel pita and was served with browned/old lettuce. The falafel itself was mediocre, nothing spectacular and same for the hoomus. The service was pretty bad as well. It was a weeknight around 6 pm and there were a few tables with customers but it took them 25 mins to get my food out! Service was so slow and obviously understaffed with one cook! I will never go back here again!"}
{"text":"After moving to the East Valley from Los Angeles, I spent a good deal of time looking for some good Greek/Mediterranean food. After being disappointed by several restaurants, I found one of the best Mediterranean restaurants, even by LA standards. Please note that I have also been to the other location, I think it's in Tempe and it's not as good...not even close. I always get the Kafta kabob (beef and lamb mixture) skewer plate. The magic really happens when you make good use of sauces...By that, I mean: Taziki, Tahini, Hummus and Garlic sauce. Mix em' up and taste it again for the very first time, for the next several hours...BURRRP! :-) The owner (Silvia) is very outspoken (in a good way) and breathes a lot of life in the ambiance of the restaurant. She also seems to remember her regular customers by name and what they order. The buffet is pretty filling, but if you want those homemade authentic, mediterranen tastes, order a plate off the regular menu, because buffet meatballs (while good), don't quite cut it. I don't usually get too excited about recommending specific restaurants, but trust me, the food at Phoenicia's is just to amazing to pass up and you owe it to yourself to try it at least once!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite middle eastern/Mediterranean food place in Arizona. The lentil soup is my \"not feeling good\" go to. The food is excellent and has been that way for the several decades I've been eating here. The prices can't be beat. It has a bit of a \"hole in the wall\" vibe, but I like that.
Try it. It's great."}
{"text":"Great service great value 

Young vibrant, gorgeous servers great sights and smells. The shawarma was good the gyro was better!"}
{"text":"Phoenicia Cafe was an interesting experience. The food was really good but the service could have been better. We came here off a recommendation from a friend and really can't go wrong with the food. 

Once you walk in you can order at the front register or take a seat and have a waiter come to you - pretty standard stuff. The service was pretty slow, we thought, and they seemed to be under staffed for the number of people there. 

After we placed our order it didn't take too long to get it but they had messed mine up - giving me a salad instead of the hummus. It wasn't too big of a deal as both were delicious but the hummus is AMAZING - so I was a little dissapointed. When I told the other waitress she said she'd get me a side of it since they messed it up and I never got my side. Towards the end of the meal she asked if we wanted another pita, which would have been good to have to finish off the gyro - but, again, it never came until we were literally about to leave and I still got charged for it. 

Overall, the food here is good. The location is nothing special and the service is poor at best. The food was awesome. I got the schwarma and the other two people we were with got the gyro. I would most definitely get the gyro next time, it was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"This place is good but they need to post the prices for there breakfast buffet beside on the window in the corner.  They only have one size drinks for the kids and they do not tell you how much it is.  I was thinking I was going to drop 30 for my family but it ended up being over 50.00.  We will go back but we will ask for the menu so we know the prices are.  They just Expect people to know."}
{"text":"I think the Phoenicia Cafe really tries, but it does not always quite succeed.  For example, the chicken kabob was tasty but two of the pieces were raw in the middle.  The pita bread was thin and like cardboard.  And the baklava had little honey and almost no flavor except a bitter tang (?).  

On the other hand, the kibbee were fantastic (so says my wife who is a kibbee pro), and the portion large for the cost despite being called an appetizer.  The lentil soup was a cut above average, and the side sauces excelled.

I know this is a neighborhood ethnic restaurant and so I tolerate the odd layout, the cheap tables and chairs, the lack of decor, and the waitress who didn't really communicate well with us.  But I guess we won't be back.  Inconsistency in food preparation kills as far as a restaurant is concerned."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years and have always had a wonderful experience. The staff is so friendly and attentive and are great at their jobs. The food is always so delicious. The portions are pretty big also."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night and Nina seated us right away. She is one of the best waiters I've ever had at a restaurant. She's very attentive and took such good care of my fianc√© who absolutely loves eating his meals with a side of anything spicy. She brought out green chili peppers for him and kept ensuring we were enjoying our dishes. 

I ordered a beef shawarma plate with a side of taboule and basmati rice. Everything was SO fresh and tasty! I devoured my plate and my fianc√© devoured his chicken kabob plate within minutes lol. In my opinion I don't think there is a better Mediterranean restaurant than Phoenicia! Highest recommendation!"}
{"text":"I had a lunch here today, first time.  I'm giving it 2 stars because I did not appreciate the owner's, or person whom I paid my bill to at the register (appeared to be the boss or manager), attitude.  He most definitely has a very fake \"smile\" to simply this or in other words, you can tell he's ruthless and a complete ass but is compelled to show his teeth! 

I ordered Greek fries, gyro, and wings; all were good nothing out of the ordinary.  Typical.  The server was good too. 

Here's my issue: when I was paying I asked why my total was $22 something out of curiosity (gyro combo is $8.99 plus $5.99 for wings + tax) and the owner or manager showed an attitude.  I politely asked for a breakdown and he showed his teeth and said \"this includes service..\" I asked what he meant by \"service\"? He again appeared to want to almost wanted yell at me but showed a fake smile said \"gratuity\" as if I didn't know what that was! Instead of saying \"service\" the moron should've said gratuity and I would've understood the first time! Bottom line, F you dine in this moron will slap a 20% gratuity automatically.  I PAY TIPS very generously but DO NOT like restaurants to add this to my bill without my knowledge.  This should be an option NOT an obligation although EVERYONE must pay a good tip for good service at their own discretion, I'm a strong believer and supporter of this.  BUT a business should not be allowed to impose it.  Besides, they do this for their own interest NOT the poor servers.  Just google this, you will find out! 

I may never return here again for this reason it's a matter of fairness.  They will overcharge you!"}
{"text":"So good and cheap! We get the Greek fries every Friday. Servers are always welcoming. Great selection!

This place is obviously locally owned so keep up the great work and support your local businesses!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mediterranean place in all of Arizona.  The food is fantastic. Sylvia and her staff provide amazingly warm and friendly customer service.  Gyros and shawarma are amazing.  Best hummus is the valley.  Would recommend to anyone looking for authentic Mediterranean cuisine.

Tip: keep your receipt to come back and get 15% off your bill Tuesday through Thursday"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Just had lunch here and it was great. They were pretty busy for lunch today, but my family and I were seated promptly. I had the Gyro sandwich and tea. As usual it was great. We always start with the hummus which is the absolute best I have ever had. Today I got a 1/2 pint to go so that we could enjoy it at home. My family and I go here a few times a month and we always leave happy. I really like seeing the owner when we visit as she is friendly and kind.  The servers are great as well and always greet us like we are family. If I could give more stars I would! Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem! My wife and I love middle eastern food, and we are always looking for various middle eastern restaurants. The food was outstanding, I had chicken kabob along with the best tabouli and right on par with the best hummus ever. Silvia the owner was wonderful and fully attentive. My wife had a gyro and loved it as well. The service was impeccable and even though we live about 20 miles away we will be hitting this place a lot. I can't wait to try many of the other items on their menu. Kudos to Silvia and Ryan too, we'll be seeing you again real soon."}
{"text":"One of the better middle eastern spots in the east valley.  Huge portions and delicious lamb, rice, and hummus.  Very savory."}
{"text":"Just as good as the Tempe location without the Tempe location attitude."}
{"text":"OMG! Thank you fellow Yelpers for recommending this restaurant for Greek food.  My roommate and I stopped in here for lunch today and we were both thoroughly impressed. The Greek fries are awesome, the hummus is definitely the best I have had in the valley and the walnut baklava was heavenly. For an entree my roommate had the combination schwawirma. It was tasty and there was plenty to share. I choose a shrimp dish (sorry can't remember the name) but it had red and green peppers with a few carrots and onions sauteed in a red sauce with rice. It was all superb! The food here is WONDERFUL and to prove it I have already decided to return next week. Please give this place a try. The server was a gem as well. Can't wait to return..."}
{"text":"We went in on a Sunday and were greeted and offered the buffet. The selection was so-so and the gyro meat looked so dry I almost walked out. For $13, I wasn't impressed. But the main menu was available so we each ordered a gyro and fries, with one bumped up to feta fries (Greek fries?) for $1 more. The portions are very generous, and good flavor of the gyro meat (when not sitting in a warming tray). The fries were piping hot, which helped melt the feta cheese. They use too much Tzatziki for our taste (on the Greek fries too), but it tastes good so next time we will order it on the side.

I've been back a few times since, and know how to order to our taste - with Tzatziki on the side, and an extra pita since the portions are so generous!"}
{"text":"I have eaten gyros all over the Western US. Since moving to Gilbert in 2011, I have tried gyros from different Mediterranean restaurants all over Phoenix. I now only will get gyros from Phoenicia. Sylvia and her staff are second to none. They always treat me like family when we come in. The size of the gyros here is mind-blowing. I don't know if it's even possible for them to fit double meat in the pita, you won't need double meat anyways  You will not leave here hungry, and you will absolutely leave here happy. We always get gyros, Greek fries, and baklava. I've never once been dissatisfied. They even know my name when I come in. If you enjoy Mediterranean food and have never been here before, it'll be worth your time to try."}
{"text":"Love the food but similar places like oliveo grill are way cheaper and Med fresh are way more tastier! The service is friendly but what gets to me here is the owner/men at counter up front- they aren't friendly at all & don't ever smile or greet you! 

And this is really cheap, They have offers on yelp & when i click to use it, the guy at the front says NOO u can't use it! Why have offers and entice customers to come to the place and then say no to them after they are in! Marketing ploy?! Well it's not like I m gonna leave now bcs of that, will I? Hence the stars or STAR!"}
{"text":"I stop by Phoenicia once a week for the hummus deluxe with gyro - it's a perfect lunch, supertasty hummus and the gyro meat make my mouth very happy.  The folks that work there are always pretty nice, and I've never been made to wait an unreasonable amount of time for my food.  Very happy to have them in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"The best hummus in AZ!!!!!!and the gyros are pretty bomb!!!! I started eating here while at ASU twenty years ago and keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"Although they no longer have the buffet here, it is a top notch spot for Mediterranean cuisine ..the staff is outstanding the food is off the hook and the atmosphere is grand.  We have been here a couple other times before I knew about yelp but now you will see me check in more often...more to come folks"}
{"text":"Other than getting the wrong order, the chickens dry and pita is stale. I'd just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and good prices. We had the chicken shawarma plate with rice and hummus.  The chicken was great much better that some of the other Mediterranean place that I have been to."}
{"text":"Went here one afternoon after seeing it many times but never trying it. I had the gyro and it was SO delicious! The meat was moist and tender and the portion was HUGE! My friend had the hummus and dolma pita which she said was really good and I think will be my next try! Well priced an authentic, and there is also a middle eastern market attached next door. Definitely worth a try and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I like it.  The food was mostly very good, the service was good in a hurried sort of way and the prices are reasonable.

We ate on a weekday evening and the place was bustling.

In the valley of the sun, Z's Greek at 40th and Indian School continues to be the standard bearer for this sort of cuisine and Phoenicia does not measure up, but they are solid enough that I would return.

I would add something clever and Greek or Middle Eastern here but I've got nothing right now so you're out of luck.

If you like, send me a compliment with something good and I will add it to the review and credit you..."}
{"text":"Probably the best Falafel in the valley.
It's very crunchy on the outside; soft, moist, and flavorful on the inside; and not greasy. Large Falafel balls make it a very filling dish or appetizer.

Been here a couple of times. We first came a year ago because of a Yelp coupon, but it turned out we couldn't use the coupon for the buffet. We decided to keep the coupon for later and try the buffet. The buffet offered many choices for sampling. There was no Falafel on the buffet, but they did have hummus, dolmades, a couple salads, shawarma, cabbage rolls, lentil soup, cinnamon sugar crisp pitas for dessert, and other meat entree items. When we got the buffet we also ordered some Falafel and Fool to try. 

As I mentioned earlier, the Falafel is fantastic, but the Fool wasn't as good as we expected; there were a lot of red and green peppers, and those flavors overwhelmed the flavors of the fava beans and there seemed to be a lack of spices.

Buffet food was decent, but we decided that next time we came we would order off of the menu in order to get our favorites. The dolmades were oily and tasted canned (you can buy canned dolmades from middle eastern grocery stores). You can definitely get you money's worth with the buffet, but other than getting full I don't think there was a dish that had us wanting more.

We came for our second visit this summer with our Yelp coupon. As an appetizer we ordered a sampler, which came with some Falafel, baba ganoush, hummus, and taboule. The Falafel was amazing yet again, the hummus was pretty good (they make it in house fresh), but the baba ganoush didn't taste quite right and was nothing to write home about. The taboule was very good; lemony, and not too oily.

For our entrees we both ordered lamb kabobs (not on the website). Lamb was very good. It was a little overcooked and chewy, but they flavors were very good and the portion size was large.

Our appetizer took a long time to come out, so the owner told our waitress to bring us some complementary cups of lentil soup. This was very nice of them and we are fans of their lentil soup.

Overall the entrees aren't anything special from what we have experienced, but the Falafel makes this restaurant worth the trip. If we come again, we will probably just order some Falafel and hummus. They do have desserts available which we have not tried, and they have smoothies which looked delicious. By reading the board of smoothie flavors and ingredients, it looks like the smoothies are naturally sweetened with honey or fruit juice, and they have very unique ingredients.

The owner has been there every time we have come, the service is very friendly, and the restaurant has a comfortable environment."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is just a bit strange.  It's connected to a middle eastern market and the waiters/managers/owners are just not super friendly.  The food I got was delicious -- it was some kind of chicken combo and it came with the largest plate ever, all kinds of sides -- potatoes, rice, dill sauce, on and on.  If you do go, at least walk through the market next door -- they definitely had \"full and half goat\" listed for sale.  gross."}
{"text":"Cous Cous Review: 

I had heard so much about the cous cous here that I had to try it. I really didn't know what to expect, especially considering that cous cous is a tiny pasta that I have always known to be somewhat bland. Well, not here. 

First off, the presentation of the meal was very nice. A big pile of yellow cous cous in the middle surrounded by vegetables, with a lamb shank on the side. 

The waiter, Hakim, told me to start with the cous cous as to not fill up on the meat. He said that in Morocco, the family eats from one large plate and the mother divides the meat into equal portions for the kids only after other parts of the meal have been eaten. 

He was right, and the cous cous was a treat in itself. It had a texture reminiscent of the maza used in Mexican tamales, but less greasy.  It had a buttery flavor and could be eaten fluffy of smashed together. 

The vegetables were in what tasted like a tomato based sauce that was light and sweet.  There were a variety of vegetables including bell peppers, cauliflower, carrots and peas.  Similar to American beef pot roast vegetables, they were very tender and went well with the cous cous and the meat.

The meat! Oh the tender, tender lamb shank that was falling off the bone was very similar to a traditional american pot roast, especially combined with the veggies and the starch.  It is exactly what I would expect a family to sit around and eat together in Moracco or here, just like I have done many times with my own family.  

It was a very hearty meal, yet I didn't feel like taking a nap afterward.  I was surprised to find that the flavors were very familiar, with nothing standing out as especially different from what most Americans would consider commonplace, but that is not to say it wasn't fantasatic.  I'd eat this meal again, but only if I wasn't looking for a culinary adventure like I usually am when I am out and about.  Like my friend John once told me while I was waiting for him at a restaurant, \"Just order me the oddest thing on the menu, if they don't have anything odd, I'll take the soup.\"  

So, in conclusion, this traditional fare is great, a safe choice for a hungry person not looking for any surprises."}
{"text":"This is a place that every fan of Middle Eastern or Greek food should give a try at least once. It's located a brief walk north of ASU Main in Tempe and always seems to be doing well because of their great food. Lunch is the busiest so I recommend going to this place in the late afternoon. Their menu has all of the typical favorites of Middle Eastern cuisine so when you try an item for the first time, you will most likely recognize it and love it. The service is quite fast in both waiting and cooking, but they're not too keen on giving refills unless you order water. The ambience and environment is great. With painted walls murals and often times Middle Eastern channels playing on the television or music, you feel as if you have stepped into the Middle East without leaving Arizona. Connected to the restaurant is a lovely specialty grocery shop. Whenever I browse this section, I always find myself making a purchase. I have been here quite a few times and the business as whole seems to improving and progressing each time. This has definitely become one of my favorite eats in downtown Tempe. The only issue I have is that unless you go to ASU, parking is difficult to find during the early afternoon. Also, you have to pay for metered parking so remember to have some quarters ready if you want to go here."}
{"text":"Great place too eat! The food was great and are service was friendly. We were impressed with overall dinning experience."}
{"text":"I came in with my cousin today and on one of my friends and we had the BEST experience. I grew up eating middle eastern food, African food, Mediterranean food, etc. So when I taste something authentic I know what I'm talking about. This place was amazing  I'm not the biggest fan of Gyro meat but it was delicious and cooked well. My plate was only a little under $14 but it was so huge I couldn't complete it. Also the Greek fries are incredible and you make it yourself it's so perfect. The waitress was a beautiful Egyptian and she was so nice! I also met the owner and she was the sweetest lady she made you really feel at home. I witnessed her speak to every customer that was in the restaurant. I'll definitely be back this is my new go to place when I'm feeling home sick!"}
{"text":"Favorite Greek restaurant in the area. Wait staff could use a bit of improvement on refilling drinks- it seems they get pretty overwhelmed when busy. I will bypass that though since I really love the food. Their falafel is the best- especially served on a pita. Gyros and Chicken Shawarma are super tasty.  They have a reasonably priced buffet if you would like to sample a bit of everything.  I usually order take-out and the orders are quick."}
{"text":"Great service! Very attentive and super nice. Food was delicious, especially chicken skewer, hummus, and falafel! Gyro was ok- had more flavorful ones. We had the vegetarian sample platter and combo skewer platter. Seating is a bit limited but didn't have to wait."}
{"text":"If they would open one in Central Phoenix near my home, I would be happy to give them a 5!  The location is a bit far for a regular visit.  Build one in central phoenix, make it bigger with more selections!

I went for the weekend buffet and it was quite good.  There were limited selections, however, and I did not see some of my very favorite Middle East dishes. The stuffed grape leaves tasted like they were from a can instead of homemade, but I could be wrong on that.

However, the food they did have on the buffet was excellent and I will certainly make the 45 minute drive again for the food when I need more!"}
{"text":"Called ahead take out order. Stated I would be getting a smoothie when we arrived, but the woman taking my order forgot to tell me the smoothie machine was broken. As I'm consoling an upset toddler she is motioning for me to sign my cc receipt. Really, my hands are full, and my order is not even ready yet. Salad was soaked in dressing. Called back, yes all to go salads are served with dressing on them, so beware, you have to eat it ASAP or have a big soggy mess. (That's what I get for stopping at Jamba Juice on the way home)"}
{"text":"Sylvie is the best! What a wonderful server and fabulous human being. When I spend money to go out to eat, I consider service in addition to flavor and Sylvie has it in spades. I continue to return in part because of her."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek restaurant I've found in the east valley so far.  I really liked trying the chicken shawarma, and their rice and hummus was delicious.  Best of all was the baklava, of course!  I'll be back to try the kabobs and gyro, also the Tempe location!  My mom liked the crepe with strawberries."}
{"text":"I was a little worried that I wouldn't find good Mediterranean food here in the valley, but this place has soothed my concerns. Everything I ordered was good, even the tabouleh, which can sometimes go disastrously wrong. The service was fast and friendly, and each time I've gone, the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Clue #1 that it must be an authentic and tasty restaurant:
Seeing the placed packed with Middle Easterns and Greeks!

My party of 3 came here and used the Buy 1 get 1free entree deal via YELP promo. We paid $4.21 each!! Such a steal! We ordered the Shish Kabob (lamb) and Gyros Plate. Portions are HUGE. We ate three or four pita breads each with delicious hummus. The lamb was my favorite, so tender, so soft, and very delicious. 

If you're a college student or looking for a yummy cheap eat, this is it! Use your smart phones, check-in, mention YELP and get a deal! On the ride home, that's what me and my friends talked about: how we just ate some of the most tender and delicious food for under $5!!"}
{"text":"The lamb off my gyro was so fresh, the pita was lightly toasted and the home made sauces just add to the appeal of this amazing place. If you're in Tempe you have to come here, for me Greek is usually too greasy and oily - this place avoids that for what feels like a proper meal. Definitely go."}
{"text":"I drive well out of my way to go here.  I love the Ghallaba.  I don't know of another place that has Ghallaba.  The Hummus and Baba Ganoush our some of the best I have had.  If you like Mediterranean food you must try this place.  Don't be put off by the lack of parking or simple look of the place.  Go in and you will a fan too."}
{"text":"I base this review off of the gyro plate which is my favorite Greek order. The pita bread is thin and nicely crusted. The lamb is thin with a wonderful layer of flavor on the outside. You can tell that they sliced it off of the giant spinner. The Greek salad is perfectly seasoned and the saffron rice is great. It is definitely an authentic gyro plate. 

Just checked in to try the Shawarma and I got a 50 percent off on the second plate. My new review is on the chicken Shawarma   The garlic dip is unreal. What a great plate."}
{"text":"Something wrong with watching the war on the news, hearing about  Israel bombing the shit out of Gaza, and a Palestinian girl serving you dinner at the same time. That is precisely what I did tonight at Phoenicia, though not exactly on purpose. 

The first thing we noticed walking in is how surprisingly nice and clean the place is for a middle eastern restaurant. Seriously, it's really tidy. The second thing I noticed is how odd the waitress was acting. She had to be on something crazy. She was practically running to do things and there were only 3 tables in the place, all busy eating... just bazaar. She was not very friendly but a competent waitress nonetheless. She said things like \"you ready yet?\" and \"give me your cup so I can get you more soda.\" Whatever, at least she was doing her job well. 

I had the shish kafta which is basically a shisk kebob in a sandwich form. It was very good with a nice mix of veggies and good hummus. The only complaint from me is the lettuce they used was of mediocre quality, and I like the way they built it, with the veggies on the inside. Nothing is worse than when your veggies all fall off because they don't have anything to hold them in. What a novel idea, put the meat on top and use that to hold everything in there. I can't believe I've never thought of that myself when I make pita sandwiches. Leave it to the Mexicans, those buggers can figure out how to make a rocket ship out of duct tape and cat hair I swear.

Side story, I had to replace a window screen on my 3rd floor and I called like 10 screen companies and none of them would do it. Finally I got the nerve to buy a screen at Home Depot and pay a Mexican to put it on. He and a friend climbed the damned tree out front and put it on a stick. While holding it in place with one stick, they used another one to turn the fasteners and lock it into its fittings. Fucking a.... 10 professionals couldn't do it, but the first Mexican day laborer I get figures it out in 5 minutes. 

This was a good experience and I'd definitely go back. It's inexpensive, easy to get to via train, and clean. Next time I want to try something more substantial as I'm still a little hungry, but my fat ass needs to cut down on portions anyway."}
{"text":"I used to recommend going here instead of other places, but it seems lately that their quality has gone down and their price up. 

Their pita boat used to be 7.99, but they raised the price to $8.99, and took off the drink. 

The student burger combo is fine, but it doesn't come with a drink and you can't get greek fries.

I stopped by before work, and it took 30 minutes to get a hamburger. I was late for work. So just plan for a wait. 

The dining room isn't tremendously big, Probably a few tables outlined by booths, so it won't work well for large groups.  There is a patio outside, but I don't know if the wait staff would have ever known you were out there without going in first."}
{"text":"Great middle eastern food in Tempe! The chicken shawarma plate is tasty, especially with the home made garlic sauce. Some interesting drinks include the rose water lemonade, definitely a new way to spice things up.

The place is pretty small, on Friday afternoons it can get pretty packed. Parking sucks, but its ok since the food is so good.

A bit pricey for a small middle eastern restaurant, but the selection and portions do justice."}
{"text":"Good Greek food, friendly staff, will definitely go back.  Prices were good as well. Had two Greek gyro plates and hummus was delicious!"}
{"text":"Service was ok.... The guy at the register seemed as if he was irritated with me for asking if the bread was a pita or lavash flatbread and if I could substitute tahini sauce for tzatziki sauce. He said you mean garlic sauce and I said no tzatziki. And he wrote garlic sauce on my order and I had to correct him again....

I went for lunch and I ordered chicken shawarma sandwich, tradional baklava because they offer many flavors, and spinach pie.... First off they use cheap ingredients. 

Chicken shawarma sandwich was on a pita instead of lavash flatbread, squishy thick tomatoe, chunky iceberg lettuce because it wasn't even diced all the way, and a runny tzatziki sauce. The spinach pie taste as if it was store bought not fresh at all. And my baklava was made with what taste like all peanuts.

Very disappointed. And it was my coworkers first time trying middle eastern food. I'm sure she won't give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and friendly. Best place in Gilbert for chicken kabob, rice, pita and hummus. Best part is- the whole family loves it! They are missing a good dessert, though. Not a Baklava fan."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food. My favorite is the hummus with lamb and the garlic paste. Their tabbouleh is WONDERFUL too. Everything is made fresh in house. It makes My Big Fat Greek Restaurant taste like fast food if you ask me. This is very authentic. 

If you eat in the restaurant often, they will come to know you by name which is nice. They will also know what you order. I guess they know what I order when I call to carry out too! The customer service is great and it is some that you hardly ever find anymore.

We used them to cater our daughter's birthday party and let me tell you, it was a HIT! I wasn't sure about everyone liking ethnic food, but those that hadn't had it before really enjoyed it and have since visited P.G. The price point per person was reasonable and Sylvia, the owner was really helpful when we were trying to put the menu together. we weren't sure how many pounds of lamb and chicken to get. She was really flexible to adjust their Maza platter since we ordered two and  didn't want as much feta and olives on the second. After all of these years of eating there, I am glad that I finally had a chance to use them for catering. I highly recommend them for their delicious food and for their reasonable prices for catering. I do think that the price for catering is really reasonable compared to the prices that are on the regular menu. Keep in mind they do have lunch specials that are served with a yummy lentil soup! Five stars for the quality and taste of the food and for the price point of the catering and the customer service!"}
{"text":"Despite the fact that I've lived pretty much on campus for 3 years now, I had never ventured, until recently, to any of the restaurants in the 'block' between Mill Ave/University Drive/ and Sun Devil Stadium.  I wish I hadn't waited so long once I went to the Phoenicia Cafe.  Its definitely one of the most authentic restaurants I've been to in Phx/Tempe, which is always a plus.  The restaurant  is located in a building shared with an Arabic food market, which is cool if you want to try something different to cook at home.  Besides the awesome location and atmosphere of the restaurant, the second awesome thing I noticed once I went here was the waiter, who was probably one of the nicest waiters Ive ever had.  As soon as we sat down he started making jokes and being friendly, which made us feel very welcome and friendly.  Now on to the food.  As I said, Phoenicia is a very authentic place and thus being so they have amazing Mediterranean dishes.  I love gyros, so I got the Gyro Pita Boat (i guess they also have a dish of just the gyro meat too, which ill have to try next time) and my girlfriend got the falafel and hummus.  Both of our meals were generously portioned and really flavorful, you can really taste the authentic spices they use in the gyro meat, the falafel, and the hummus, which really makes a different.  And maybe even better than the food itself was the drinks, they have fresh fruit nectar  which are amazing and go great with I would imagine anything on the menu.  To top off our dinner, we ordered Baklava for dessert.  The Baklava here, Im not exaggerating at all, is by far, the best I have ever head..it's sugary heaven.  All in all, pretty much every aspect of the Phoenicia is great, a perfect spot for lunch or dinner on campus at ASU. I definitely will be back again soon."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Gilbert! All of the food is freaking amazing! The hummus and gyro is the best I've had anywhere. I always feel welcomed and taken care of every time I have been here. I love to bring others to enjoy this place and it is the one place I come to have a date lunch with myself."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a couple times now and both times were so good! We tried many dishes as to sample a little of everything. Greek fries are amazing so was the Lebne (hope I spelled that right). Silvia makes the experience so worth it. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Man this place is good! Family owned and operated makes it even more amazing. I would frequent their location in Tempe and I am glad they have one in the east valley too! Keep up the great work Fouad and family."}
{"text":"Awful service, first time I have ever walked out of a restaurant. 10 minutes to get drinks, while one server just walked around very dirty looking and not helping take orders. Food is to average for poor service!"}
{"text":"08/13/07 UPDATE:
They have the best, most crisp, french fries around.  And you can now watch music videos on their big plasma screen, from the Arabia channel.
===========================================

Opa!  I'm speaking Greek, right?

I write this review as a Caucasian male whose only familiarity with Mediterranean cuisine was when I ingested a leaf while eating grapes.  Turns out the leaf ended up being from a tomato vine.  I'm still wondering how that wilted foliage found its way into my cluster of concords.

Back to Phoenicia.  My first time there, I orderd the safest thing I could find... gyro and fries.  Roasted lamb and cucumber yogurt sauce.  It was like my mouth was having a party, and everyone was invited.  But wait, it gets better.

I see they have babaganoosh, and momentarily, I flash back to the Wedding Crashers movie.  Great, now I have to order it... and I'm glad I did.  Its just eggplant, people.

On subsequent visits, I ordered the chicken shawarma and kabobs, cilantro jalapeo hummus, tatziki.  Fantastic.  There is also a great place in Tempe called Haji-Baba.

Phoenicia also has a huge mural on the wall, of a Greek coastal setting, which you can stare at while you fill up.  For some reason, I keep reminding myself to wait an hour before going into the water.

This place is a real treat.  And their treats (desserts) and great too.  I'll take the pistachio baklava.

{"text":"You really can't go wrong with anything you order here. Food is cheap and the restaurant is near ASU. Unfortunately, many students have discovered it's quality and price, making it a bit crowded during the semesters. Lunch can be exceptionally busy. I'm a vegetarian and can't vouch for the meat dishes, but the couscous with red sauce is wonderful as are the other vegetarian options. If you can't decide, go with the vegetarian platter: baba ganoush (though it is a bit garlic-heavy) hummus, falafel, grape leaves, tahini and tabouleh, with pita on the side. There's a Middle Eastern shop next door with imported goods. The restaurant's easy to find, as it's just south of the mosque, which has the traditional dome and minarets."}
{"text":"Delicious! Friend and I were simply looking for a good Mediterranean restaurant to enjoy some Falafel and hummus. We found this Gem and we could not be more pleased! They have a private parking lot and a market attached to their restaurant. The waitress was very friendly and you could tell it was a family-owned restaurant that took a lot of pride in their work. My friend and I shared a giant combo platter and thoroughly enjoyed it! The Taste was spot-on in the portions were great. I would definitely go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I thought it was Greek food, it wasn't, I didn't like it. Not many people there at lunch time just two tables I should of known that it wasn't that good. However they were nice people."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken shawarma plate and the beef shawarma plate! 

What can we say?! We love shawarma...

The chicken shawarma is usually my favorite. But at this restaurant the beef shawarma is way more tastier! But don't get me wrong the chicken was also very good.

This is a family owned restaurant.. everyone is really nice and friendly. Mother, father, daughter and son! 

They also have another location in Tempe that we will try out soon.

We hear many good things about the items on the menu."}
{"text":"Dry chicken, decent Gyro meat. Super average food overall. Really friendly service however."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to this restaurant 3 times, and each time we love it more and more. All their foods are authentic and fresh. Everything we have tasted is so good. We would not choose any other Mediterranean restaurant, and would not hesitate to make the 30 minute drive. The staff is always friendly, and the restaurant is always clean. They really want you to enjoy the food here. Friday and Saturday nights can get really crowded and busy, but it's worth it. The food comes out fast and fresh. We are so happy that we found such a yummy Greek/Mediterranean restaurant. I would definitely recommend this to someone. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am highly biased because there's a Greek place in N Phoenix that has and excellent Gyro along the most perfect fries you've ever had. But that place is an hour away. Phoenicia Cafe has excellent gyros and the Greek fries are also very very good. I will definitely be back to try some other things on the menu. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I went there for the weekend lunch buffet. Food was pretty good. They had a decent variety and everything was fresh. Other reviews are pretty conclusive. Check it out"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat!!  The gyro plate is our go to dish. All of the side dishes are great!  The basmati rice, salad, tabbouli or hummus are all outstanding. Chicken Shwarma is awesome too. The wait staff are all super-friendly and knowledgeable.  The dining in experience isn't the greatest, I wish the seating area was larger with more intimate tables.  It sorta feels like eating at a Subway. But, the food is outstanding and you can order to go as well."}
{"text":"I'm Greek American - and this place has the best Greek salad !! And the Rice salad insanely good!!! Just a delightful surprise! Won't disappoint"}
{"text":"Ordered food Togo. My first time and it was delicious. We ordered the hummus trio, Greek fries, and shuarma  combo. Honestly the plain hummus was so good on its own. I just wish it came with cucumbers to eat with the hummus. Maybe I'll ask for some next time. 
Everything was flavorful and good. Portions were huge. One combo plate was more than enough for two people."}
{"text":"My personal favorite Gyro spot in Arizona for the past few years."}
{"text":"We've been here before so this is just to remind you to enjoy the experience of a restaurant aka market, butcher, deli and middle eastern bakery all under one roof. =. When you are in the Tempe area it is a real treat.  They make their own pita bread sold fresh and warm so you can pick up a package before you leave.  Wonderful assortment of baklava as well.   The owner is a delightful friendly man from Tunisia.  He makes you feel very comfortable and eager to please his customers.   We ordered an assortment of wonderfully prepared Middle Eastern dishes.  The servings are enormous.  I had the gyro sandwich which was so packed with the beef and lamb gyro meat. It was a challenge to eat.   We also ordered the chicken patty dish which was seasoned just right.  The rice was wonderful with a side dish of a garlicky sauce.  The hummus is absolutely the best especially if you are a garlic lover.   The server hailed from Morocco and happy to tell about his life spent there.  I can't say enough good things about this wonderful Cafe.  P.S. If you go on a Saturday the meters are running so make sure you put in your money.  You can easily get a ticket.  Only free parking on Sunday otherwise you must put your change in the meters.  It is different in Downtown Phoenix where Sat. and Sun. are free.  Same as Tucson, so beware before you park outside."}
{"text":"Good food.  Friendly staff. Good price. Very clean.  I love the gyros!  Tell Sylvia that Richard Gere sent you."}
{"text":"Highly recommend Phoenicia for lunch, dinner and catering. They do it all, and is delicious every time. They always create dishes as close to home cooking as you'd expect. By far the best middle-eastern food out there."}
{"text":"This place is such a blessing to our neighborhood! Amazing food from a family owned business. This place is constantly delicious and you honestly can taste the love. I'm always finding myself craving their hummus and falafel. This is the kind of place you'd drive to if your Postmates forgot half of your order and be glad to pick it up yourself."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a great price.

I had the pleasure of going during their Sunday buffet.  What a treat.  $8.99 for all you can eat Gyros, rice, chicken, meatballs, hummus, fruit, lentil soup, stuffed grape leaves, pita, etc., etc..... the food was all very fresh and wonderfully seasoned.  

The staff was knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.

Their food is all home made and you can tell by the excellent taste.  Their lemon aid is fantastic, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is an awesome Mediterranean restaurant. The food is delicious and made from scratch. It's a MUST place to be while in town."}
{"text":"Looked promising clean however on ordering the dolmades appetizer got the canned version. Quite disappointing. Next time I'll try their fresh cooked food"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean in Arizona. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"5 stars- Gyro Plate or anything gyro-related
2 stars- for possible shady business practices

Came here for a stats workshop recently and had the hummus recommended to me, so I happily obliged. When a group of us got there, we were struck by the tiny booths that leave you very little leg space between you and the person in front of you. Being the smart people we are, we moved to the booth at the end that we were able to maneuver a bit to create more space. 

Once the space issue was figured out, we finally ordered. Greek fries for the table, gyro plate for me and whatever else the table ordered. The gyro plate was amazing. The gyro itself was some of the best gyro meat I've ever had. The meat was so tender, super salty, and perfectly delicious. I got the side salad and hummus to go with it. The hummus was good, not the best, but good. It was a little chunky, so take that for what it's worth. To each their own. The salad was surprisingly delicious and came with a nice tzatiki dressing. 

The Greek fries were also great. The fries were nice and crispy, which I always appreciate. I couldn't exactly tell what the dressing was, but it was something creamy as well. I think it was the same thing that was on the salad.

Now the bad.

When we went to pay, they overcharged all of us. I paid $12.99 for the gyro plate, $3.99 for greek fries and got charged $21.50 or something like that in the end. That means my tax was about 4.50 or 25% or so. I hadn't realized it at the time and wasn't until I actually saw my friend's bill become $9 from a $6 sandwich. I sort of ignored it because I had already been confused by Tempe taxes when I went to El Hefe where all our food came out to an even number even after taxes. I thought I was the wrong, but in the end, I realized, nope, just like others on Yelp who have noted their shady business practices, they do overcharge. Beware. They didn't even put the prices on the bill they gave us to confuse us even more. 

Now that you know though, do the math and call them out. And when I actually went back by  myself the next day, I didn't get overcharged. It could be because the guy did the math wrong when he split the bill the first night we went or it could have been intentional. I honestly don't know. It seems like other people have had this experience, so I don't know what to make of it.

I went with 4 stars overall because the food is so good. Just make sure you don't get ripped off."}
{"text":"The staff is awesome and food was wonderful. Today was out first time here and it a must stop by. Everything is clean and was very comfortable"}
{"text":"My friends and I had twenty minutes before our show started; could they accomodate us? 

The lone, surly waitor grunted assent. In five minutes, our food and checks were ready. Still no smile, but I'm willing to write that off to cultural differences, because no one does rush orders anymore. 

As others have said, the food at Phoenicia is perfect. I love the hummus with chicken, the shish kabobs, and the gyros. I can camp on the patio with the deluxe hummus all afternoon. 

The decor is basic diner laminate and flourescent lighting, but it was clean, and the patio and big windows count for major points."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Mediterranean places I dine at on the regular! Extremely friendly employees work here! One of the best thing is the owner is alway making sure the guests are enjoying their food and recognizes those who come frequently. Enough about the environment, let's talk about the delicious food! I am always impressed with the food that comes out of the kitchen! Everything is made fresh and not mass produced like your chain restaurants! If you are on this side of town, I highly recommend dining here! You will not be disappointed, I promise!"}
{"text":"To be fair, I've been here a few times over the years. In my opinion, they have actually gotten BETTER over time. 
We tried several things, and were only dissapointed by the Greek fries.  Not much sauce, and the fries themselves were old and hard---icky!!

 So, the gyro boat, Very nice!  This time the meat was cooked perfectly. 

The vegetarian app plate is also pretty fantastic. I love the fact that they don't go salt-crazy here at Phoenicia. Okay, I'm not a  huge fan of their  hummus, but that doesn't mean it's not good, it's just not fantastic.  On the  other hand, the Baba Ganouj WAS fantastic.

The lady who served us recommened a lamb / beef burger, so I had that.  the meat was lovely and very delicately seasoned.  It could have been a bit bigger, but what the heck. I do recommend that they change the bun that goes with it.  The bun had a kind of a flaky texture and was almost sweet, and it really didn't work with the burger.

The chicken shwarma salad was beautiful.  I'm drooling as I type.

I'm sad that I didn't check in when I went...I could have gotten a free sandwich!

 I could say more, but I'm getting hungry.

Update:

I went again with two different people this time.  I ordered a pita boat that was a mix of baba gaoouj and tabouli that was so good it made me want to cry.  PLEASE TRY IT!!  4.5 stars now!!  They still have to lose a half star for those nasty greek fries from before...right?"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm stuffed! Just had the Gyro plate with rice, salad & hummus. Everything was tasty and fresh. Service was fast & friendly. Two people could share the plate I had. Its easily 40 minutes from my San Tan home but if I need a Mediterranean fix I'd make the drive."}
{"text":"this is a good, yet simple establishment.  The menu is a mix of Middle Eastern, some North Indian, and some American.  It is a simple place to stop and get a bite for lunch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants when I want greek/mediterranean. Expansive menu, big portions. I've had other things on the menu, but I usually stick with the shawarma combo, gyro meat and chicken shawarma, which comes with 2 sides. Quality has been consistently excellent. Hummus is good; as a seperate dish, the falafel is very good. And yes, the garlic sauce is awesome and I always ask for an extra.

Only issue is since I've been going here for the past several years it seems like the portions have started to go down a little, and price go up a bit."}
{"text":"Great service, super sweet lady (owner). Ordered hummus, gyros and beef shawarma, possibly the best in town!!!!!!!  Go here........now!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was in Arizona on vacation and had dinner here one day. The waiter was a hoot and worth going back just for his sense of humor. The food was great and they had an excellent menu with something suitable for everyone. If they had one in the Dallas area I'd definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"ok...really liked the food and service...bought some stuff from the grocery store as well
here's my beef....went there on a coupon(1st time)ordered the ultimate combo for 2...had a coupon for $8 off on 2 entree's....nothing on the menu was $14 or more and the combo was $28.95...owner would not accept the coupon....told him I wasnt going to argue and wouldnt come back....what a shame...the coupon is to advertise and I would go back and take folks there as I told him but messed up attitude...too bad...if I am in the wrong great but I dont think so...maybe I need a lawyer to explain what 2 entrees is...dumb..."}
{"text":"This place has the best gyros outside of NYC. I'm from back east, and just spent over a year there to experience the city again. I'm back in AZ now and I can't wait to head back over this spot. So so good!"}
{"text":"The Best Gyro sandwich i have found in AZ in the last 2.5 years of living here. From now on when i want a Gyro, Phoenicia is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the Phoenicia Cafe over by ASU when I was in college and loved it.  Authentic and delicious Greek food.  I am very excited that they opened this second location near my house.  The Greek fries are to die for.  The chicken schwarma is better than Pita Jungle.  The seasoning and sauce were very flavorful.  My dad got the gyro platter and said the lamb was tender and flavorful.  My mom got the Ghallaba without spice and loved it.  The prices are right and the service was friendly and fast.  We will be coming back often to try new menu items and get our Greek fix.  Nothing better than a Mom-and-pop restaurant.  I highly recommend either the Gilbert or Tempe locations."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat. Great service and outstanding food (especially the gyros). Would love to explore the market side more when my two year old isn't pulling all the candy into her arms."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times for their Sunday buffet. It is so tasty! Everything from pitas, rice, hummus, chicken, gyro meat, salad, lentil soup, tabouli, kalmata olives, and various other rotating dishes are all so good. The regular stuff on the menu seems a little pricey but the buffet is always priced right and very, very good!

The service is great. The cute woman working the weekends is talkative and funny. All of the staff make you feel right at home while you're eating. Their garlic sauce is crazy good, I highly recommend asking for that! They'll get you some from the back because they don't put it on the buffet line. That with the chicken?! Oh my gosh. Yum."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and to top it off, my service was great! My server was very nice to us and our food came out in a timely fashion. It was also one of the best hummus i've ever had! There are also many vegan options :)"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and was very disappointed with the food quality and service.  In fact, I think it made me sick with some type of food poisoning (late March 2017). An apparent patron in front of me in line, was talking to the owner about heartburn before I placed the order. The patron said I could go next, but I let them finish their conversation.  I waited and listened to them (two middle-eastern foreigners conversing), and the owner said something about \"alveria oil\" would be helpful for his heartburn and wrote something down on a piece of paper.  Anyway, I then ordered the Falafel de Luxe, the owner said to put my tip in the jar on the left, and I then waited about 15-20 minutes. A little strange vibe in there at that point. When I got back to my office, I remember sitting down and  eating the meal they ended up handing me, but really felt awful afterwards and thereafter became sick. This place needs some type of food inspection, in my opinion. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"Not only was the food amazing, the service was beyond expectations!  We came in for lunch today and I was not feeling well (pregnant) and the owner immediately brought me soup to help my nausea, I didn't even have to ask.  I really felt like I was at home and my mom was taking care of me!!!  I am so pleased with my lunch experience.  Great food and an even better atmosphere.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the shwarma combo. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the garlic dip was bomb. The hummus was also amazing. Enjoy"}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful. The shawarma chicken is so moist and flavorful. Everything is FRESH and well made. The falafel is very yummy as well. We get cravings for their food. The owner is a very gracious woman who welcomes guests into her restaurant. We enjoy the atmosphere and food. This is the best Mediterranean restaurant in the Metro Phoenix Area."}
{"text":"I really loved this place. Came in on Saturday wanting their buffet, After reading stellar reviews here, and that it was $8.99, I had to go. 

The place is modern, shiny and very attractive. So were the waiters I may ad.  I have to say, everything I had was delicious. The hummus, Greek salad, stuffed grape leaves and such - wonderful. These kinda pizza crisps like middle eastern pizzas that were superb- and we ate the last 3. I am not a big tabbouleh fan- but it was the best ever.  Their lentil soup did not disappoint. 

In the hot section, they had great stuffed cabbage, meatballs ( not Italian style ), rice, broiled fish, chicken and gyro. My favorite was the stuffed cabbage and meatballs w/rice. The gyro meat was ok, I was happy as can be. We also got one soda ($1.99) and a baklava -great by the way ( $2.00 ),

My partner went to ask for more of the pita thing-ees and they sad we could have more, but for $2.50. He didn't even want to tell me but he let it slip out and that really but me in a bad mood.  What the hell ? It's a buffet and you want to charge me extra for something that ran out?  Hell no. I was ready to go Jersey on them- but that's the old Jose'.  The new Jose' was full, and with great food  I just felt like shutting up. The Boy was happy too with his frozen yogurt- he especially liked the cheesecake flavor. 

We asked the very attentive and attractive waiter for our bill - I look at the check and it's $34 and change. I almost had heart attack. It seems the price of their buffet has gone up in one year - from $8.99 to $12.99. I should have seen the small sign behind a counter that said the price - I didn't to my regret. Food prices have gone up, but this buffet is not worth $13 in my opinion- especially when they want to charge an extra $2.50 for something they ran out of.  Any way, with tip we took a $38.00 hit. Truly I was devastated as that is way, way above our pay scale - and it was my fault cause I didn't check the price. But where the hell did I get the $9.99 price ? Maybe I am crazy- except that I check their web site and it says $9.99. 

And yet my friends, I shall return because  I really loved the food.. They gave us a coupon on the receipt that gives us 50% off on second buffet, so it will cost the $20 I originally was going to pay. And maybe they will run a groupon too."}
{"text":"Not a real Mediterranean Restaurant! Bad imitation food. Everything comes in abundance of Ranch, Ranch and more Ranch. Rack of lamb was very disappointing as well. Not recommended at all!"}
{"text":"Right up there with hajji baba as my favorite middle eastern restaurant in Tempe. Amazing gyro plate and gyro salad. Great hummus!"}
{"text":"Phx winter season:

We just got back in town today, for the season, and came straight from airport , my wife is unpacking and I go immediately to pick up our take out:  chicken shawarma entr√©e with hummus and rice.  Its our favorite once a week, required dinning, must have

On my diet, no sugars or grains, I will break that fast with their baklava as pictured.

Staff is very nice, service is excellent, over said, but they treat u like family."}

{"text":"I'm a neophyte when it comes to Greek food, but this place is amazing! Everything seems to be home made, it's always fresh, and when I get a to go order, they always make sure there's enough napkins, pita, forks etc. Almost feels like my mom making my lunch back in the day. Great date night spot. Get the hummus trio!"}
{"text":"Poor, moody service. 
The place is religious. 
Chicken is bland and dry. 
Fries are great. 
Gyro is good.
2 gyros, 1 side of chicken: $30.  Ouch!
Terrible, distracting music."}
{"text":"This place has ruined me. It is THE best hummus I have ever had. Everything is delicious here. you can't go wrong. Service is hit or miss and the bill can get bulky even just for one person. It's worth it. Store hummus will never do what Phoenicia hummus does for me."}
{"text":"Delicious. Absolutely hit the spot. The staff was friendly and welcoming and the owner is a doll. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming one of my most favorite lunch places..... They have the best hummus in town, and their gyro meat is off the hook. I usually order the Gyro salad.....it's a huge portion, so it could probably be shared..... 

We've also ordered the lamb shank, which was pretty good.... kind of has some curry flavors and a stew like sauce to go with, it's pretty good, but maybe not as good as the gyros.

If you are in the area and need a quick lunch, don't pass this place up..... order extra pita to eat up all that hummus!"}
