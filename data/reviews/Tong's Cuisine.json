{"text":"Lower price, reasonable portion, ok taste. Not very outstanding. Order cashew chicken with egg roll for lunch . The portion is ok. The chicken is a bit watery, and egg roll is dry. Ok to try once a while just to settle one of your meal, but not recommended for those who look for good Chinese restaurant ."}
{"text":"Can't believe it took me four years to discover this place. Yes, the outside is a little shady. But the food is awesome, and they give you a good amount for the price. Big fan! I recommend that vegetable lo mein and the crab ragoon. Best Chinese in Oakland, for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in Oakland. Better quality than Express. Fast service, cheap lunch prices. Would recommend Black pepper chicken and Hot Tea. Furniture is a little dated but food is great!"}
{"text":"Stopped in @ about 3 in the afternoon on a Sunday (Cinco de Mayo) . I pedal by this place almost daily and it always smells great. I was very excited to finally have time to stop and get something! I ordered a veggie eggroll and broccoli with garlic sauce to-go. They get two stars for being fast. I was in and out in less than 10 minutes. I was the only customer in the place, so I'm sure that had something to do with the lickity-split service. 

My eggroll had been fried, but it wasn't crunchy. It was soggy and unappetizing. The broccoli w/ garlic sauce was even more disappointing. At $8.75 the portion size was much smaller than I was expecting, which turned out to be kind of okay because I didn't like it much. The sauce was watery and boring. It wasn't spicy or garlicky! Although there was some broccoli in the dish, it wasn't the main feature. The majority of dish was onions and celery and the broccoli that was in there was overcooked compared to what I expect from a stir-fried dish. 

This was my first attempt at Chinese in Oakland, so I can't give a specific recommendation for somewhere else. However, I feel pretty safe simply suggesting not here."}
{"text":"I've had their food on a few different occasions since I live so close and every time I'm disappointed. 

The General Tso's was dried out and soft with barely any sauce or flavor. The vegetable roll tasted like it had been popped in a microwave for a few seconds and wasn't at all fresh. 

Avoid this place and go to Sushi Boat instead for good Chinese."}
{"text":"pork rib potato, 
hot sour soup, 
crab rangoons, egg roll

No kidding, seriously delicious! 
It's not a fancy though, all food homemade that's what makes me absolutely love it! 

By the way boss lady is a nice person!"}
{"text":"I see these other reviews on the restaurant are not great. But honestly speaking, this is a great place if you know what to order. The pictures posted are like lunch specials made for Americans...if you order something on the extensive menu, you'll get something Chinese. I recommend Braised ribs(with Chinese cabbage), spicy beef (not sure if they call it spicy beef on the menu, zi ran niu rou), garlic with vegetables (ask them what fresh vegetables they have today)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my favorite chinese one in pittsburgh!
The water spinach is the best one I ever had in this area, I also love the tofu pot, and any fish cuisines."}
{"text":"I tried this place based on review, and I was very disappointed. I got generals chicken special; this comes with fried rice and an egg roll. lets start with the egg roll, it wasn't crunchy! it was fried but it's like they splashed it in water after to make it soggy. the rice wasn't even fried, when I order fried rice I am definitely not expecting white rice with soy sauce poured over it. I found this more of a put off then places that try to pass yellow rice for fried. finally the chicken, it was descent and that is the only reason why I gave this place 2 stars."}
{"text":"This is one of the BEST places to get Chinese food in Oakland. The service is very FAST for both take-out and dine-in. The prices are fair (about $8 per lunch/dinner combo) and the value is competitive (great food portions). Combos come with an entree, rice, and a side (eggroll, chicken on a stick, crab ragoon). Don't be sketched out by the appearance of the place! The food quality is exceptional!...always comes out hot and delicious! I highly recommend the General Tso's Chicken and the Amazing Chicken! A great Chinese place that will not disappoint!  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Pretty Mediocre. I wouldn't pick this as my first place in Oakland to grab Chinese food."}
{"text":"This is the Americanized Chinese food I've been searching for in the Oakland Area! The outside is extremely unassuming, with absolutely not a single window in the place. The inside of the restaurant is absolutely no frills. If you're looking to gorge yourself on pretty decent Chinese food that passes the test of time (and Asia Tea House just is not cuttin it), head on down to Semple Street to treat yourself to Tong's Cuisine. I have to admit, I was sketched out by the austere vibes of the place and the brusque manner of the staff. Not too friendly, but most certainly efficient. The amazing chicken is advertised as \"lightly battered and fried in our special sauce.\" Well, this is exactly what amazing chicken is -- Its amazing! I got it with fried rice and my plate was literally clean once I was done! My husband was more daring and got the crab Rangoon, lo mein, and Kung Pao chicken. He devoured the entire thing, and shared his lo mein with me. The lo mein was on the slimier side but thats the way we like our lo mein! Overall, we would not go back because the ambiance was so blah, but will definitely be getting take out soon."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch hours. Their lunch special entrees come with your choice of steamed rice or fried rice, and a side of chicken on a stick, egg roll, or crab rangoon. All for $6.31! Really not a bad deal because they give enough food to fill you. I've tried their general tso's chicken, kung pao chicken, and Hunan beef. All made well and tasty. 

If you're ever in the south o area and wanting to get something quick for lunch, this is the place to go. 

They only have one or two servers working most of the time because there aren't that many customers when I'm there usually. The service is just average. I just come for their food haha."}
{"text":"Had it not been for a friend who is a regular here I don't think I would've found this place or walked inside. We went here for lunch and I was very satisfied with my meal. The menu is rather extensive but on the back page are lunch and dinner specials. The lunch specials are $6.91 per plate. I ordered the vegetable fried rice which was delicious; a little on the greasy side but not too bad. It was slightly odd to me that cups of water were already prepared and stacked which meant no ice. 

The restaurant is much larger than it looks from the outside. The dining room is a large, wide-open space with several tables. It is very clean. And on the back wall is a 3D piece of art that I could not stop looking at. If you dine here you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.

There is a $10.00 minimum for debit and credit cards."}
{"text":"just your typical take-out or dine in Chinese place. I was impressed with how quickly they accommodated new customers and how fast the food came out for a to-go order. yes, I know what you're thinking .... is that a good thing or bad thing? I would say good. The food was very delicious and tasted fresh and didn't give you a feeling of \"what the hell am I eating\". I ordered the chicken with vegetables and steamed rice. really good lunch price and no complaints on the taste! will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the best and most authentic Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh! Almost everything is so good! You can also get a discount if you pay in cash."}
{"text":"It looks so sketchy on the outside, but not too shabby inside. The place was deserted when we stopped by to eat. Got their beef teriyaki dinner special with the chicken shish kabob on the side. The chicken shish kabob was pretty much deep-fried so it was so dried. Almost tasted like chicken jerky. The beef teriyaki was typical greasy Chinese food with tons of salt. The service was so lacking. Our waiter pretty much watched TV the whole time. It was too difficult to get his attention so we just grabbed what we needed ourselves. There was nothing gourmet about this place. It's just another average greasy Chinese venue. I probably won't be back here again, unless I'm that desperate."}
{"text":"So, I heard about this restaraunt on this website.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have known it at all.  I was looking for a good place to get a quick take out lunch.  I ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce an old time favorite of mine.  I put in an order for that and one vegetable egg roll.  The eggplant turned has a typical flavor, but some of it was too mushy.  Some of it was the texture that I like and some of the pieces had no form to them at all.  The sauce was adequate.  The vegetable egg roll was pretty standard and nothing interesting.  At least it wasn't stale and hard like sadly quite a few places I have been.  Every Chinese restaraunt has egg rolls, but not very many really have good ones.  I would say that if I was dying for some Chinese food for lunch again at a decent price I would order some take out again."}
{"text":"The outside is iffy - heck - the inside is iffy as well, but the food is tasty, quick and reasonably priced. Nothing to write home about, but a solid \"A-OK\" meal if you're craving Asian food."}
{"text":"It's a classic mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall. This is how I would describe the esthetics and ambiance of this quiet little garden of goodness. I popped in on a Friday for a quick take-out lunch. I had debated whether or not I should have called ahead, but inevitably opted to order in person. Perhaps my favorite part of the experience, from the time I ordered, to when the food was dropped in my lap, literally only took about 5 min! As the self-proclaimed King of shrimp fried rice, I can honestly give their dish my royal seal of approval!

So, to wrap it up, the food came fast, the portion matched the price, and the overall quality of the dish was divine!"}
{"text":"Definitely looks shady from the outside but it's one of the best cheap Chinese takeout options in Oakland. The amazing chicken is so good!"}
{"text":"Tongs is great! It's cheap and the outside might look a tad shady but the inside is super nice. I went in 24 minutes before they closed and they were still really nice."}
{"text":"Very clean fast food Chinese! Lunch and dinner specials are definitely worth the price and the quality also comes with a small side, all of which I've tried before but the crab rangoon is my personal favorite and I always get the Kung pao which is very good. Wish they would give a little more rice though."}
{"text":"YES.  This is the simple, affordable, homestyle Chinese restaurant I've been looking for in Pittsburgh.  This gem can be found in a super unimpressive box of a building in Oakland, which an interior as unadorned as the outside.  My fiance pointed out that half the tables are numbered by marker drawn on the walls.  During our roughly hour and a half there, he was the only Caucasian amongst the 20 or so tables that filtered in and out until another fair-skinned gentleman showed up as we were leaving.  Our Pitt-graduated friends, who used to be regulars but hadn't been there for over a year, were remembered and warmly greeted with a \"long time no see\" in Mandarin by the owner at the door.  To me, these are the type of things that signal a Chinese restaurant's authenticity cred, at least in a small, Chinatown-less city like the 'Burgh.

The four of us each ordered a dish to share family-style, which ended up being the perfect quantity for our table.  We sampled a mix of authentic and Americanized dishes, including the SPARE RIBS WITH POTATO, WATER SPINACH WITH FERMENTED TOFU (comes with choice of being sautéed plainly in the wok or with the fermented tofu), BEEF AND BROCCOLI, and AMAZING CHICKEN.  None of these were dishes that would ever blow my frickin' mind with its novelty, but all were unassuming, decently-prepared, fairly priced, and tasted like home.  The authentic dishes, at least, are the restaurant versions of what our parents make at home.

In particular, the spare ribs suspiciously like how my dad prepares them, although he doesn't slice his potatoes with wavy edges (now a clear oversight in my upbringing).  Porky, tender, amazingness.  I don't often eat meat, but when I do, I want it to be SPARE RIBS, PLEASE.

The water spinach, a must-order for me at any homestyle Chinese place, was a bit overcooked, which prevented it from reaching its wonderfully crunchy potential.  Luckily, I don't mind veggies cooked to death (but give me undercooked and I'll cry), and its wonderfully distinct flavor shined through, enhanced by the fermented tofu sauce.  I wish there had been even more slices of jalapeno tossed in, as I appreciated the heat in an otherwise chili-less meal (a rarity for this incorrigible chili-head).  And a big, heartfelt thanks to Tong's for not slapping a ridiculous $14 price tag on this $2 dish like most Chinese restaurant in town.  (I love you Sichuan/Chengdu/Whatever Gourmet but your prices are laughable.)

The beef broccoli, my go-to Americanized-Chinese order, was perfect in its brown saucy-drenched goodness.  It scratched the itch, hard.  Aaand our Korean friend was responsible for his signature syrup-sauced fried chicken order. :)  But my typically orange chicken-deploring fiance gobbled it up, so I assume it wasn't too terrible.

Our $43-ish dollar bill (also including a pot of hot tea and 2 extra bowls of rice) came out to $45 including tip if we paid cash, an option we most certainly opted for.  Add in its proximity to our home, and I can certainly see us being regulars at Tong's.  It's the perfect option for when I don't feel like cooking, or when I'm craving my dad's cooking, or a weekend brunch like today, orrrr basically any other occasion I can make up.  Yes, I pretty much couldn't believe how satisfied I was with this cheap meal considering how not spicy it was.  I am only disappointed that it took us over a year in Pittsburgh to this bastion of bare-walled happiness."}
{"text":"It's a bit sad that it took me so long to try this place out, considering it's been around for as long as I've frequented Oakland. Maybe it's the fact that it's off Forbes along a quiet side street, or that it doesn't look too inviting from the outside (no windows, and the sign is a bit run down :/). At first glance, the menu doesn't stand out too much either, but they do have some more authentic items; one might describe it as a bit more upscale than Golden Palace, without the buffet. They have some Cantonese offerings, but less extensive than the former. We went with that side of the meu and ordered a wonton noodle soup and a beef brisket noodle soup. Both were solid, particularly the beef noodle soup. The portion was generous in that they brought a huge bowl filled to tbe brim. The broth was super savory, and the beef was good quality, with a good balance between lean meat and fat for flavor. There were also some leafy vegetables as is standard with this dish. Overall I was very pleased with this, considering that it was only about $8."}
{"text":"What can I say about Tongs Cuisine, or \"Uncle Tongo's,\" as its known around my condo? Well, it's run by a severe, no-nonsense Chinese matriarch. And that woman runs that place like a well-oiled machine, a sweatshop if you will. Pickup orders are ready in 10 minutes EVERY SINGLE TIME. And the food? Oh, the food! The food is exquisite. Ive been in Oakland for over 9 years and I've never had a Chinese joint provide food of this quality. The amazing chicken is just that. The egg rolls will make your eyes roll to back of your head. A wonderful restaurant!

{"text":"Egh, very mediocre Chinese food. Did not think the portions were worth the price honestly. 

The taste is pretty good, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Delicious. I went there at least once a week. Order any entree PLUS one iced milk tea."}
{"text":"With Oliver, Jingwei, Rui, Hongwei, the sweat and sour fried fish was pretty good and the rib was also good, I like the environment very much, it's like the typical American style of indoor decoration."}
{"text":"The food is good. Typically very fresh. I eat here a lot so I have had a few missteps here and there but I would recommend it to others. They have a very affordable lunch special.
I only wish they offered brown rice and that they had vegetables with their amazing chicken dish"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for Chinese food in Oakland. They have an extensive menu as does the other local Chinese restaurants, but the kicker is that Tong's uses the meat that you order; that is, if you order chicken, then you get chicken (not cat, dog, or pigeon).

In all seriousness, in a highly competitive market where students are demanding quick preparation times, Tong's does an excellent job of balancing quality and preparation time."}
{"text":"Ever since my first Szechuan experience as a freshman at Pitt, I've been on a seemingly infinite mission to find-and-dine every Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. I've been through a solid amount in five years, and the bi-weekly Chinese Food Power Rankings certainly fluctuate, one place always stands out in those inevitable hungover-hungry-quickbite-fulldinner-preparty-postparty-craving moments: Tong's Cuisine.

I originally wrote out a list of reasons why I go here longer than their lunch specials, but deleted it in favor of a shorter summary:

It's affordable. It's quality. It's convenient.

Try the crab rangoon, try the braised ribs, try the spicy beef, or try the General Tso's. They're all pretty rad and blow away the competition, especially when it comes to filling that you-will-be-hungry-soon-order-takeout-now Chinese food void."}
{"text":"The champagne of cheap Chinese food. The food tastes better than the building looks from the outside. Lunch/dinner combo is the best deal, but bring cash--$10 minimum on any cards"}
{"text":"This place BANGS. And it BANGS loud. A true triple threat of quality, portion size, and service is not to be outdone by many, especially in the Oakland area. There's a good reason why I've been a loyal customer for the past 5 years. 

The Food: You better buckle 2 seatbelts because a surge of flavor is going to blow your beak square off your shoulders. The portion size is enough for even the healthiest of hogs in your crew and that is exactly what the #commonman looks for when faced with a culinary decision. Do not sleep on the starter dishes because a Tong's meal without fried dumplings or crab rangoons (pictured) is like a gym with no weights, you might as well of just kept your lazy self on the couch. 

The Service: Oh boy, Mrs Tong's (name uncertain) is a goddess amongst the masses. Her hilariously unapologetic personality keeps you in tip top shape every time you step foot in this establishment. I've been called crazy for what I'm about to say but if that's the case then I don't want to be sane; Mrs. Tong's has made me a better man. Legend says she has not missed a single day in the last 14 years. THAT is the dedication and servitude I crave so dearly. 

X FACTOR: Crab Rangoons"}
{"text":"I recently went here for their lunch special which includes your choice of white or fried rice and an egg roll or satay stick. I got their General Tsao's chicken and was very disappointed. The side of fried rice I got did not contain any vegetables and only had one piece of chicken in it. On top of that, the fried rice was over seasoned with soy sauce. They also over-sauced the General Tsao's chicken and I had to pour out the sauce so the chicken would not be saturated with it. I prefer Taiwan Cafe to this place which unfortunately is closed for the time being."}
{"text":"I know, I know, the outside looks off-putting. 

I unfortunately missed out on this place for 3 years because I was not interested in trying the restaurant just because of the appearance. BUT, this is one of those hidden gems. 

It's very plain and simple on the inside. Don't expect anything else. 

They offer a good combination of authentic Chinese food and American style Chinese food. We often get both. As for the American style food, the \"Amazing\" Chicken is their best. I swear the sauce is the same of Panda Exxpress'. 

My favorite appetizer is definitely the crab rangoon. I have had this dish all over because it is so common but it's very, very good here. 

The servers can be short and brusk but they're just busy and to the point. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is give this place a chance but keep an open mind about service and appearance."}
{"text":"My friend was raving about this place, so I had to try it. The food definitely isn't awful, but it isn't great either. I had the amazing chicken with fried rice, and the fried rice wasn't very good. It is super cheap for a dinner combo though!"}
{"text":"I honestly think that Tong's might be my all time favorite American-Chinese food establishment here at Pitt. Affordable prices and super bomb delicious food, every single time. And this time I actually got a huge portion so it was extra good and I think I might have actually cried tears of happiness rather than from sadness since I had a really tough exam the same morning. I only ever order general Tso's chicken from other places but their amazing chicken is just that, AMAZING. I am forever an Amazing Chicken person. Egg rolls are perfect every time. Food so hot you burn your tongue but you don't care because it's that good... only reason why I would ever wish that I could live in south O...."}
{"text":"I ordered a pad thai for take out. The employees were a bit brisk but efficient and kind overall. They went to the kitchen themselves to make sure I didn't have to wait too long (it took less than 5 minutes for me to get my order).

When I opened my bag (they tied it up in a plastic bag), I realized they gave me a fork, a fortune cookie, and to prevent the plastic bag from getting soggy, they placed a folded menu sheet underneath the contained food.

Now, I realized that they're are two kinds of pad thai: 1) not spicy with lots of peanuts and has bean sprouts with a slice of lemon on the side and 2) spicy with little peanuts and lots of onions, carrots, and lettuce (no bean sprouts or lemon slices).

Sadly (for me), Tong's pad thai is the second one. What was strange in that not only was the container hot but the food itself looked like it was sitting for a bit and the noodles were thin but strangely wide. I had to ditch the fork and get myself some chopsticks to eat it because the noodles kept on breaking.

Like usual, fortune cookies don't disappoint me."}
