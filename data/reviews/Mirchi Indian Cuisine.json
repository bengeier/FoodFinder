{"text":"Looking for an Indian buffet for Sunday lunch we settled on the newly opened Mirchi Indian Cuisine. We both had the lunch buffet for $9.95. The food was fresh, delicious and  superbly seasoned. Homemade relishes and chutneys rounded out to the meal. The owners are very friendly and pointed out  GF  and vegetarian options. Pretty much everything is GF. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place took over the old Bay Leaf indian restaurant so we gave it a try last night with new management and first of all I never expect good customer service at indian restaurants but these guys have excellent service! Extremely friendly!!
Second the food, we moved here from Chicago and so far nothing had met our expectations on taste, we were always disappointed but this place has changed that! The food was so amazing that my picky kids were licking their fingers and finished everything on their plate! The chicken 65 Biryani was amazing...chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken all excellent!! You even get free tea after you are done :)   Sooo happy I found this place!! I just hope they don't change their taste because once a restaurant becomes famous they start cutting corners and change their menus...keep doing what you guys do cuz we love your food!"}
{"text":"Had eaten at old Bay Leaf Cafe several times and enjoyed it very much. Returned today to find new owner. My wife and I had the lunch Buffet. We enjoyed it very much and you can't beat the price. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Good indian food! Have already been to this establishment 3 times since they've opened last month. Definitely check it out. Also wanted to add, they have five levels of spiciness I believe and the mildest level wasn't too hot which was perfect for me."}
{"text":"Ate sad lunch buffet for NINE DOLLARS!!!!!  Dried out biryani, drier tandoori, dry and tasteless butter chicken, ok chai, barely warm veg korma.  After I made the mistake of commenting on temperature and quality of food got chewed out for showing up at 1pm.  Why did I expect quality food at that hour?  Well, because you are open for business, because the food was out, because you dared brag about all your other restaurants.  $9!!!!  No signs showing price, guess I should have asked.  Pitiful.  Those positive reviews must have been left by owners."}
{"text":"We went here because our daughter had enjoyed Bay Leaf. We had no idea there were new owners. What nice people! The food was really good and when you ask for heat, you get heat! I ordered a mutton dish at a 3 of 5 spice level and it was darn spicy. Worked for me. Only knock is that food came out to my wife 5 minutes before mine. I'm sure they'll get that worked out, it was only their second day in operation. Oh, and the garlic Naan is just delicious."}
{"text":"Came to know about this new restaurant in Chandler and tried their lunch buffet today.

Here is my overview

Thumbs up 

Decent selection of Veg and Non-Veg Options.
More flavor than Spice.
Awesome naan. 
Nice ambience.

Location 

Finally, I would recommend trying this place if you don't mind driving a little off from main cross streets."}
