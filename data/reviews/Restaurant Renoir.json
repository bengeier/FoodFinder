We made reservations through Opentable and arrived promptly on time. After checking with the host, we were brought to our table as they asked us about coat check. They also brought over a bag hanger for my handbag which I thought was very thoughtful!

There was only one menu available to order at Renoir for Christmas - their Christmas Dinner Special! At its affordable price, we were able to taste foie gras, truffle, and caviar all in one evening! Because I was in my third month of pregnancy, I was very careful with what I was eating. Hubby and I chose to order one of each choices available, with my husband having the foods that I couldn't have :P, such as caviar and foie gras. We also skipped on wine pairing...because well I was pregnant and hubby was being considerate :D.

Not too long after we ordered, complimentary bread was brought out. Nothing too special here.

Our first dish of the night started out with foie gras panfried and paired with pork shoulder. I didn't have too much of the foie gras (just a bite) but it was so delicious! Paired with butternut squash and sweet and sour mushrooms, the appetizer was very enjoyable. Very satisfied!

The next dish, or the first main course consisted of homemade buckwheat flour gnocchi, artichoke cream and fresh sea urchins. Of course, I couldn't have sea urchin...so my husband had it. Now that I think about it, we should've asked beforehand what Renoir's Christmas dinner menu consisted of, or at least if dietary substitutions were available. Too bad we realized this late! Anyway, this wasn't my favourite dish, but it was still quite enjoyable. Perhaps I didn't like it as much because I couldn't fully enjoy all the ingredients in the main course.

The next course was a refresher in between our main courses, the gingerbread granité. I had a feeling that it may have been made with alcohol, so I asked our server if it was as I was pregnant. He promptly returned with a alcohol-free version for me to enjoy :). Essentially, granité is a granita, a cold shaved refresher made with sugar, water and other flavourings. The gingerbread was a great flavour especially for the Christmas season, and as it's one of my favourite desserts, having it in an ice cold version like this was a pleasurable experience. Kudos to Renoir for also having alcohol-free versions available!

My husband decided to get the first choice on the menu for his second main course: Royal quail, foie gras, black truffle and vegetables. I, on the other hand, decided to try their second choice: Arctic char, cauliflower mousse line, Granny Smith apples, shellfish and caviar.
Hubby and I were both quite surprised that we were able to see foie gras, black truffle and caviar in both of our dishes put together. At the price of the Christmas menu, it doesn't seem like it's possible as the three ingredients are fairly expensive. Well, we weren't complaining! My husband enjoyed his dish very much, while I was pretty content with mine as well. I gave the caviar portion to hubby for him to eat instead of me :(.

Overall, both dishes were equally delicious but I think the royal quail was more preferred by both of us over the Arctic char.

For dessert, we had the chocolate orange yule log with orange sabayon and praline chocolate. I didn't think I'd like it very much but to my surprise, I finished the entire slice wanting seconds! Google tells me sabayon is like a light custard like dessert with origins in Italy. I'm not the biggest fan of having citrus flavours with chocolate (I like my chocolate dense and rich), but this dessert was quite good even with the orange flavours.
Verdict

Overall, Renoir's Christmas dinner is phenomenal for the price you need to pay. At $89 per person, having 4 full courses is a real bang for your buck deal! The ambience and atmosphere of the restaurant is also the perfect place to enjoy a romantic dinner date with your significant other, with friends, family, and much more. The upscale hotel atmosphere also makes it suitable for formal meetings.

The service we received was fantastic - everyone was all very friendly and helpful with all of our requests no matter how small or large. I do wish the menu had more dietary options, but we never asked if substitutions were available beforehand.

Now that I'm not pregnant anymore (yes I gave birth! :D), I would love to go back for a full on meal with my husband and enjoy all the foie gras I can have; too bad I now live in Vancouver! Anyway, I highly recommend Renoir and their Christmas Dinner this upcoming winter season (I know it's so far away...but you can never be too early!) and I'd love to hear your thoughts about it if you decide to go!

As Renoir is located inside Sofitel Hotel, valet parking is available."}
{"text":"A+ on all fronts. Attentive service, elegant surroundings, excellent food. And for the general level of the place the price was not exorbitant."}
{"text":"La place pour des brunch gastronomique au de gamme type buffet mais woow le buffetau menu huîtres, gauffres woooowww saumon frais ou fumée, très grand choix"}
{"text":"Excellent. I had the Prix fixe with foie gras, lobster/pork tenderloin combo, lemon puff pastry. French press coffee with the press left on the table for refills. My wife had guinea fowl. All elegantly presented and tasted great. Good wine selections, a little pricey. Service very attentive without being intrusive. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We were staying at Sofitel for one week and almost everyday we ate here... Derek, our server/waiter was awesome! So attentive, so educated ...the croissants and omelette in the morning were to die for! For lunch the onion soup was yummy! And at night they serve the drinks/cocktails with all sort of snacks as a compliments ;)"}
{"text":"I tried the sunday brunch. The omelet was amazing. Lots of desserts. The waffles was to die for. The croissant was a bit hard, but it was better paired with the french pressed coffee. So I am giving a 4/5 stars. I definitly will go again for the dinner."}
{"text":"Nous avons été très bien reçus. Service impeccable. La présentation des plats était aussi excellente. Un amuse-bouche nous a été offert: une bouchée de tartare de thon. Un bon commencement. Nous avons été ensuite satisfait du mi-cuit de thon et du foie gras torchon. Nous avons essayé la Côte de buf, qui était bonne, le Homard et cochon, qui ne contentait qu'une seule pince de homard et par la suite le Magret de canard qui était plein de nerfs et pas tendre. Nous étions accompagné d'un enfant qui a mangé un repas \"enfant\" qui s'est avéré dispendieux. (filet de poulet 10$, frite 8$, jus de pomme 6$ et une glace (maison) à 9$) La soirée fut agréable."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.
Fantastic service.
Fantastic ambience.

A bit pricey"}
{"text":"My husband & I had checked in late in the evening to the Sofitel after a full day of travel.  Le Renoir was the first place we dined at in Montreal and our experience was outstanding. The food was amazing. I had the rabbit dish and he had the lamb. Both meals were cooked to perfection. For dessert, we enjoyed a banana pudding encased  a rich dark chocolate shell. The staff was attentive and warm. The help to make our stay in Montreal a truly memorable one."}
{"text":"Four of us had a thoroughly lovely meal here on a Saturday evening. The menu had a nice range of options that kept everybody happy. The service was excellent, and the wine list very satisfactory. All of the dishes that we tried were very good, right from the starters through to dessert."}
{"text":"I & mom enjoyed Brunch here today.

As always we are never disappointed. Mom loves the Belgian waffles as do I, love the  chocolate sauce and the vanilla cream, I tried the apple/strawberry puree for the 1st time.

The duck legs confit were tasty & lean as was the roast beef. I enjoyed the novel service of the poached salmon made with star anise & cinnamon. The snow crab leg was so fresh it was sweet.

For me the star of the meal is often the dessert - it was today I tried all six; lemon meringue tart, mille-feuille made with both custard & cream, choux pastry filled with cream, a chocolate mousse creation with caramel & passion fruit, a fruit mousse verrine a composite of raspberry, blood orange mandarin and pistachio; accompanied by the french pressed coffee.

I kid you not when I say I short of rolled out of there.

The service as always was professional and attentive."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here twice during our vacation in Montreal. I can confidently say that I had one of the best culinary experiences of my life. I had my first foie gras taste here. The dinner was pricey but worth it. I am dying to go back to Montreal and this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place for business lunch or dinner.  Favorite was the swordfish topped with crush almonds and sliced red grapes (served with rapini and black tiger rice). Best patio in the downtown core."}
{"text":"I would have given them one star but I didn't complain in person, so I will give them an extra star since I didn't let them rectify some of the issues during my dinner.

My boyfriend and I were staying at the hotel, so we decided to have a late night dinner here. We were greeted by a friendly waitress and she informed us that they had a bar menu available. We didn't feel like having a full scale dinner, so we opted to sit in the bar.

I read over their bar menu and wasn't too enthused about the options they had; therefore, I asked for their restaurant menu (which was allowed). She was hesitant to give us the main menu, as she stated it was more sophisticated than the bar menu. I don't think she implied it to sound rude, as she was trying to help us, but it could have been interpreted that way since the BF and I were in casual gear. However, she provided stellar service, so the problem wasn't there.

Some other positives were the free olives, nuts, and pretzels to snack on. Also, we received a free amuse bouche. The last positive was the ambiance, as it was casual and made us feel relaxed.

However, the food is less than to be desired. Everything was overcooked! I decided to order from the \"sophisticated menu\", and was sorely disappointed. 

First, the amuse bouche, it tasted like bad sushi. It's free, so it didn't really matter much. It was a fried tempura muscle with some spicy mayo sauce. It would have been okay if there was something acid to counteract with the salty notes, like a lemon squirt. Also, the oyster tasted super fishy. Not sure if it was the muscle or the batter, but it was not pleasant. 

Then we got our appetizer. It was razor clams, raspberries, and baby leeks. The leeks weren't cooked enough, they were tough. I only ate a little bit of the leeks. The razor calms were delicious but would have been better if they cut the raspberries into smaller bites to match the razor clams. The raspberries added a nice sweet and tart note to the dish. 

I ordered the swordfish with stuffed squid over black rice. The rice was delicious but everything else was overcooked. The stuff squid was so tough that it took forever for me to cut into it and to chew it. The swordfish was dry because it wasn't cook properly. It had great seasoning, but wished it was more moist. Finally, the stuffed zucchini flower was such a letdown. I loved stuffed zucchini flowers, but the batter or something had a super fishy taste. It tasted exactly like the amuse bouche batter. The fish taste was not expected and was more towards the rancid end of sea flavor. I didn't finish it but my boyfriend, the human garbage disposal did. The whole dish had no balance, just like the amuse bouche - it was seafood salty. 

I had a strawberry cake-like dessert. It was tasty but nothing memorable. 

Overall, it was a huge let down for me. The service and ambiance was great, especially in the bar area. However, the food had a lot of flaws."}
{"text":"Sat in the outside area for a bite after a long day. We ordered onion soup which was quite tasty. We ordered the duck poutin, very fresh but you must have a stomach for rich food. We also ordered the beef ribs which were Asian inspired and nice. A bit on the salty side but tasty. All in all the food and service were good but the bill is pricey for what you eat.

Came back for breakfast the next morning and had a lovely server. We ate eggs Benedict and yogurt with berries and granola, all amazing. French press coffee was done right. The bill was very pricey for breakfast for 2 as was dinner last night."}
{"text":"When it comes to restaurants within hotels, I am not usually a huge fan. Unless we are talking palace and hi end cuisine.

Somehow it is hard for me to judge the Renoir as I have only had a brunch there. But I must admit, what a brunch. This is probably one of the best brunch Montreal has. And if you still have room for desert, well they have the best \"millefeuilles\" you will ever encounter. And trust me as I am usually not a big fan of them. 

You will find an array of amazing deserts, but not only as the buffet grants you the possibility of a healthy brunch as much as a decadent one.

So basically, if you are in need of a nice brunch, be assured that you have. A nice spot right here at the Renoir.

The only thing that could be improved is probably the setting of the restaurant. Indeed more than the setting, it's mainly the furniture that kind of makes me not over excited.  This is true for not only for the Sofitel hotels, but for most hotels that tend to rely on furnitures that are really of average quality, and that brings a spirit of \"cheapness\" to the places. Unfortunately, over affordable solutions, often from China, seduces way to many hotels around the globe, and in the end it shows."}
{"text":"Went with a huge group I mean really huge for brunch Buffet on a Sunday. Thanks for accommodating to our large group. Everything great. They even had Oysters. What surprised me the most was their Waffles. it is to die for."}
{"text":"The hubby and I went to eat and have drinks at the bar area. We ordered from the dinner and the bar menu. I ordered the lamb for dinner  and smoked duck / melon appetizer... WOW! The food was amazing !!! If I were home I would have definitely eaten the meat from the bone lol. The staff was absolutely exemplary of what a high end restaurant should strive for.  They were engaging, friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and attentive.  Unfortunately this is our last night in Canada but we definitely ended it well at Renoir!  The drinks were PERFECT!  You definitely get what you pay for here... I ordered chicken strips for my kids and one didn't eat them because he said they had no taste.  The other ate just half of the portion (which was generous). Just to preface, my kids have eaten chicken strips from mom and pop places to high end steak houses / restaurants so they kind of know their chicken strips lol.  For that, I may take a half star off, but honestly this is not a place for young kids anyway so that's why I'm keeping it 5 stars for the adults. My picky husband had a burger and he said it was really good which for him, is saying a lot. 

The atmosphere : it was a very relaxed atmosphere with varied age groups, dress code was cocktail casual but we were casual as we just hopped down from our room in the Sofitel.  We sat in really comfy lounge chairs by the bar.  The restaurant itself wasn't very crowded, but the area by the bar remained packed.  You can order from the bar menu or the restaurant menu in that area so it was perfect... when we come back to Montreal I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Went to eat brunch buffet today with my friend. They offered so many different food, oyster, smoked salmon, steam, fried chicken, pastries and sweets. You can even order egg Benedict, pancake, smoothies. My friend and I had a great time there, and the service was good too. Will go next time."}
{"text":"The brunch is amazing. Service is top as well. Huge variety of food. Slightly pricey but for the quality of good and the choice you have it's super worth it. Only on Sunday's and make sure to reserve in advance."}
{"text":"Great tasting food.   The staff is very nice and the service is great. We stayed at the hotel Sofitel where the restaurant is during our vacation and dined here multiple times during our stay.   The buffet brunch is excellent with lots selection."}
{"text":"Not your average hotel bar restaurant!  We were too tired to venture out our first evening, after flying in, and thought we'd have a quick snack at the hotel restaurant, with not so high expectations despite the snazzy decor.  We assumed it would be over priced hype- as lifer/native New Yorkers, we pride ourselves at being able to sniff that kind of stuff out pretty quickly-- but were happily surprised to learn Renoir is a real hit!

Excellent meal, service and sexy ambiance.  Be prepared for a splurge, and we suggest you sit in the bar area at one of the cocktail tables, rather than in the restaurant proper.  The menu is the same, but the vibe is another notch up, in terms of decor, atmosphere, and general coolness."}
{"text":"Belated review visited July 2014
The good
Friendly very attentive service.
Two dining spaces : interior very classic white tablecloth elegant modern space and casual hip modern exterior garden patio. With the lovely weather we opted for exterior seating. I ventured for prix fixe and everyone else went a la carte. Very delicious wine by glass options though pricey.
Everything was inventive French inspired well prepared perfectly seasoned. My fois gras starter had enough interesting variants on the side  to transform the tried and true but ever delicious simple sauté of fresh fois.My rib eye steak  was a simple but beautiful rendition.My dinner companions had the rabbit and a seafood combo plate. All dishes reminded me of some tasty newer style restaurants I have visited often in Paris and French country side.
The bad 
Perhaps for price point would have liked a little bit nicer exterior option. Wine list smaller than expected for this price point. 

Overall for a restaurant I had not seen in too many top Montreal lists ,I would highly recommend as romantic destination for interior dining. I really was quite surprised it has not been more on the radar especially after my visit to much talked about Au Pieds( see my review)."}
{"text":"For brunch, this place is fabulous!!! The service is top notch, they have Wifi, the patio is gorgeous, and the food is excellent!  Dine here if you're hungry!!

They offer omelettes, waffles, salmon, roast or prime rib, salads, vegetables, fruit, desserts, mimosas, etc.

I stumbled upon this gem and am so glad I did.  I got to eat before hiking Mount Royal and it was exactly the kind of food I needed.  I could've spent more time here it was that enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Came here for New Year's Day brunch with the family.  I found the reservation process a bit awkward, in order to secure a place they emailed me a form which I had to complete and then email back.  Don't know why they didn't just take my credit card details over the phone.

The brunch buffet was very good, with a nice selection of hot and cold items.  There were oysters, roast beef, roast turkey and rack of lamb.  Also an extensive selection of delicious pastries.  Excellent coffee.

The service was friendly but they seemed very understaffed.  There was a wait for plates to be cleared and water glasses went unfilled.  We had to chase waitstaff for drinks and cutlery.  

5 stars for the food, 3 for service.  For the price, I expected better.  Next time will try somewhere equivalent like the Ritz."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. A bit too formal for my liking. Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I can't put my finger on it, but I really like this place. It could be the decor, the staff, the food and the location / convenience. 

There's just enough attention to details and I've even made suggestions to my wife how she should present my food at home."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for Mtl a Table while my parents were in town and was pleasantly surprised! 

Prices were high, making the Mtl a Table menu very worth it. The gnocchi appetizer was made with a very flavourful cheese. The cod was cooked perfectly. The dessert was tasty, but the layers were quite thick and it was a bit hard to eat through them all at once.

What I enjoyed most was the excellent service. Upscale but very friendly. Given the price, I might need to wait until my parents are back in town to come again!"}
{"text":"The food was just alright. We visited during F1 weekend. The prices seemed severely inflated. The service was good. We sat outside which was okay until they turned on blasting music; too loud. But the $264 dollars we ended up paying was off the charts for what we had ordered. Be careful."}
{"text":"Se capitate dalle parti di Montreal e volete mangiare bene in un ambiente tranquillo e con un servizio pronto e carino, questo è il vostro posto. Non è proprio economico. Ho pagato 80 CAD per un antipasto, un piatto principale, caffè, una acqua minerale gasata e un calice di Pinot Grigio. Per questo non lo consiglierei a chi vuole andarci con la famiglia. Ma i piatti proposti, un brodo di Mussels come apertura, un pesce a carne bianca, che, se non ho capito male, si chiama John Dorey, con Calamari e verdure, avevano tutti una preparazione delicata, il gusto era equilibrato, i sapori, benché mischiati, erano ben bilanciati senza che uno sovrastasse l'altro. La presentazione carinissima. Il personale gentilissimo e pronto. Insomma, da provare."}
{"text":"Great little place for breakfast. They have a nice outdoor patio that I highly recommend in the summer and definitely order the Crepes... You'll thank me.
A fresh pressed cafe is always delicious and being in Montreal at the Sofitel the atmosphere is multi-cultural and everyone is dressed to impress. Be prepared to pay however, this is a costly restaurant."}
{"text":"Je suis allé au brunch du dimanche au Renoir. Tous les dimanches, le restaurant offre 2 services de buffet pour les brunchs, un à 11am et l'autre à 1h30pm. Le repas est dispendieux mais il vaut le déplacement. Je vous recommande de prendre les gaufres et de garder la place pour les desserts."}
{"text":"OMG!I took AAA's suggestion on this, and it really paid off! My husband and I decided to try the 7-course Chef's Tasting Menu, and it was an experience of a lifetime! Our waiter Jean Michel was wonderful, attentive, and professional. All of the other staff, as well, treated us like royalty! The food was beyond fabulous. We wanted a true French-food experience, and we certainly got it. The atmosphere is wonderful, and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant! The service was excellent and fast, the waiter was very patient in explaining to us the menu and helping us choose a bottle of wine for our meal, he even helped me make some changes to the prix fixe to better suit my taste! 

The food was excellent, delicious, and just omg tasty! the rabbit puff pastry was delectable! I'm still reminiscing it as I'm typing. I also had the lamb which was perfectly done! Tender, fresh, and the fat was crispy and just perfect! The desserts were varied and also amazing, too bad we were to full to try more of them, we only ended up sharing one but they were beautifully presented. 

It makes for a good \"let's get dressed up and go out\" night!"}
{"text":"Drinks are on expensive side. Beautiful patio! Fratellini with lobster were delicious."}
{"text":"This was the hotel bar/resto in the hotel we stayed at (Sofitel Montreal)

Can't unfortunately attest to the food but the atmosphere was quirky and fun to hang out in.  It was extremely clean, and the few beers that they had were interesting

I'd come knock a couple back here again!"}
{"text":"Food: lovely , delicious french food with high quality 

Server : extremely professional with sense of humor 

Location and place : beautiful decor and centrally located"}
{"text":"This is a nice sophisticated restaurant with an \"international\" cuisine, meaning that it is good for business entertaining.  You can bring arbitrary guests here and be pretty sure they will find something appropriate (which is pretty typical for a good hotel restaurant).  There is always a vegetarian dish and a fish dish, both of which are typically very good.

The place has a very nice ambiance, excellent service, and provides a pretty quick turn-around at lunch time, or even dinner time.  There is also an express menu  at lunch time that has a nice variety of items, an interesting collection of tastes, and which comes quite fast, including a selection of small desserts."}
{"text":"Wonderful service.  We had a wonderful time. Very disciplined modern French cuisine. Beautiful restaurant.  Duck a l'orange was wonderful, as well as lamb in 3 variations.  Expertly done.  Disciplined. Expensive,  but well worth every penny."}
{"text":"I love going here for their Sunday brunch buffet. The quality of the food is excellent and the service is always good. It's so much better than the casino brunch buffet. It's one of the best brunch buffets I've been to. The price is 56$ a person but it's well worth it.

Some of the items on the menu:

- roast beef(taste like filet mignon)
- omelette station
- waffles/pancakes
- eggs Benedict
- scrambled eggs
- bacon/sausages
- fresh oysters
- grilled vegetables
- smoked salmon
- cheeses
- charcuterie meats
- creme brûlée
- Mille feuilles
- macarons
- all kinds of coffee, juices and smoothies"}
{"text":"Stayed at Sofitel, excellent hotel.  Booked at Renoir for V-day (strangely had rsvps available only 3 days before hand).  Now I know why they had space.  Oysters were fishy, food was bland tastying, though serving sizes were typically french which I like.  Went to another place after to eat something tasty as my wife wasnt so happy with her vdays din dins."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5, the lamb was amazing and tender, the duck was a bit tough and chewy, and the frois gras was absolutely amazing. There was a bit of different flavors in each dish ranging from sweet to salty.

Service: 1/5, this is where the restaurant loses its stars with me. We had 3 people in our party sharing 2 main dishes. Every time a dish came out we had to ask for an extra plate as if I would be eating off the table. Second, when the bill came, our waitress (Justine) charged us for a 3 course meal and an entree which is more expensive than just the appetizer and 2 main dishes that we ordered. When we tried to tell her so that she can fix the bill, she huffed and puffed and walked away and told us she would be back later. Third, in a nice restaurant like this, you would expect that water would be refilled without asking. We had to ask every time we needed water to be refilled and the glasses were smaller than average. We ended up giving her a 15% tip from my usual 20% and that is being very generous.

Atmosphere: 4/5, dim, romantic type ambiance. It is connected to a hotel so you can see the hotel lobby from the restaurant. They also have a nice outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Our group of 6 adults and 2 kids went there on a Saturday morning for breakfast. Service was excellent and worthy of a Sofitel restaurant. We got pampered with white linen service, and the kids got to eat pretty much anything they wanted, even if it wasn't on the menu. Décor was modern and beautiful. Would surely have given this a five star rating, except it was pricey, so I equated that with the service, but took a point off for a lack of creativity on the menu. The eggs benedict I had was good but comparable to much cheaper places, the scrambled eggs my wife ordered was once again nothing exceptional. Safe to say its best to come here if you want to impress someone or have a quite conversation (our group was the loudest in the restaurant :) Would recommend this place on the mood of the day (do you want to feel like royalty for a couple hours or not? hehe), convenience i.e. staying at or near Sofitel like we were or just to say that you ate there :) Lunch and / or dinner may be quite different so cannot comment on that."}
{"text":"We stayed at the hotel (Sofitel) where the restaurant is located and dined at Renoir twice (also had breakfast twice). The restaurant has a formal dining area as well as a more casual bar area. First night we tried their formal dining. The service was excellent. The dishes were good (to be honest, we really liked the appetizers; the main courses were good) and the presentation was excellent.
Second night we tried the bar seating. It was cozy and comfortable. The dishes we tried (a hamburger and a roasted beef sandwich) were perhaps slightly underwhelming even for a bar menu. But the staff were very polite and welcoming.
A bit of a mixed impression from our breakfast experience. First day, the staff were very attentive and our breakfast was out on time. Second day was pretty much the opposite. Perhaps something was wrong or we were just unlucky at that time."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended in the AAA book.   Had a good first impression on dining room and outdoor patio.  Opted for the outdoor patio because of the nice weather.  Seats outside are not very comfortable as they were plastic.

 I waited 15 minutes for a waitress to take my order.  My first choice from the menu  not available.  My second wasn't either!  Off to a bad start.   They should tell you up front what isn't on avaiable when they give you the menu or better yet print a daily menu.  

Prixe fix dinner here set me back 66.69 before tip.  I opted to start with a first course of black rice with a zucchini flower fried on top and burratta cheese.  The complimentary basket of bread offered a variety of tasty breads.  The waitress brought out a complimentary mini appetizer that was excellent-two morels with tiny slices of zucchini over a mini toast.   

After 30 minutes of sitting I got my first course.  It did not look appealing nor taste good.  The black rice was cooked right but was way too salty.  The burratta cheese just tasted like the cracked black peppercorns that was liberally added to the cheese.  The only tasty thing was the one fried zucchini flower, which was excellent.  The waitress asked how I like the dish and I told her that I didn't like it.  There was no offer to switch it out nor was my empty water glass filled until I finally asked for more water. I told the waitress that I hoped the main course would not be too salty or peppery.  Had I not been tired I would have insisted they take back this dish and provide something else.

An hour into dinner, finally got the main course of lamb and was told by a different waitress that it had no pepper or salt.  It didn't have pepper but my palate sensed it had salt and alittle too much of it.  Meanwhile, I overheard the couple at the next table complain that one of their first courses was too salty!  The lamb was not the best cut of meat but was okay.  It was served with green beans, yellow beans, yummy baby carrots, baby parsnips and a few fresh herbs.   Too much salt on vegetables when they did not need any salt.  I thik it was missing a key ingredient that was on the menu, lardons.  Another waitress offered to make up for the quality of food with a free salad though I declined. 

 Ended the meal with a berry creme eclair and a very good cappuccino.  The service was slow and so it almost two hours to eat from sitting down to dessert.  Way too long sitting in hard plastic chairs!  I wish my order had been as good as the free appetizer of morels and zucchini.  A good start to meal went downhill from there.  Considering the cost of 67 before tip, I expected better service, better food, and better chairs.  The manager came over too acknowledge that my complaint will be addressed with the kitchen.  I won't be coming back to find out if things improve."}
{"text":"The food was very good and service was amazing. Very friendly staff. I like that the kitchen has a big window where you can see the chefs cooking. 
The risotto was a little too salty but the lamb... oh god was out of this world. I was not too excited about the pear dessert but the chocolate mousse was insanely good."}
{"text":"Very nice for a hotel !!!! Excellent food , excellent service , the staff are very accommodating , the food is fresh , high quality and tasty ...a bit on the pricey side but the conventicle factor of eating n hitting the town running is priceless ...."}
{"text":"The food is decent and the service is good. I think it's generally overpriced - especially for Montreal. On my most recent breakfast there, I had the bagel and lox (nothing special compared to other places), a coffee, and an orange juice (fresh). Total was over $40. I believe a comparable meal can be had for $20-25 elsewhere - with comparable service. So you pay a fairly large premium for something they looks slightly upscale. I don't value this too much - but that's a personal preference thing."}
