{"text":"Realistically this should be 3.5 stars. Party of three tonight with reservations. We were late but called to let them know. We were seated right away. Atmosphere is quiet and subdued. Service was excellent and prompt (although afterward my wife said she felt rushed). Apps-bacon wrapped shrimp and shrimp cocktail. Both good, nothing memorable.  Wedge salad. Good, but really it would be hard to screw that up.  Entrees-lobster tail. Very good. Porterhouse too thin cut and not seasoned well. Sirloin. Also just ok but better with peppercorn sauce.  Sides-charred corn. Super tasty! House fries were very good with house seasoning. Baked yam and mushrooms were also just ok.  Dessert-chocolate cake was rich and moist! Creme brûlée was perfect custard-y with mild vanilla flavor.  Prices are as expected for an off strip, station property. I felt like this was a good value.  Service, price and atmosphere - 4 stars  Food quality and consistency - 3 stars Will be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Austin's 3 times and it has quickly become my favorite go to dinner place! I tell everyone about the bacon wrapped shrimp.  Being from the East Coast it's hard to find any type of seafood that I can say I love, but Austin's definitely does it right.  The staff is great and everything I've had off the menu has been fantastic!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but for a steakhouse in Las Vegas, this is very poor. Atmosphere is average and the service is good, but the dinner was poor. A family member had recommended Austins so we tried them for our anniversary. Both of us had the prime rib. Small portion for the price and no flavor. Very disappointed. My baked potato was over cooked, only ate 1/4 of it. Also had the Lobster chowder which was lukewarm and very salty.  So, I do not recommend Austins and it was a very costly learning experience."}
{"text":"So I thought about giving this place a try, given the reviews. Honestly one of my worst decisions, the waiter hardly paid attention to us and he was rude. Then the food wasn't that great I asked medium well and it came back to me completely burnt."}
{"text":"This steakhouse is by far one of the best in city! The service is top notch, the food is awesome, and the prices aren't too bad. Filet Oscar is what I get, which is a 12oz filet topped with 3oz of crab meat with a hollandise sauce! Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite steakhouse in Vegas. The customer service here is outstanding. The staff here is very friendly and will never steer you wrong when you have trouble selecting a good wine to go with your steak. I have been here several times and everything on the menu is good. My favorite is the filet au poivre. The lobster here is the best I've had as well. Bottom line...excellent service and amazing food at a very respectable price for what you are getting."}
{"text":"I have been going to Austin's since the Texas Station opened (1995) and generally have had a wonderful experience.  The staff is professional/courteous and always wanting to please.  I have not been here for a good 9-11 months so it had been some time.  We decided to go Saturday evening around 8:30pm and was quite surprised as there were only 3 tables seated for a holiday weekend.   We started with the shrimp cocktail which was very good and the chop salad which was horrible.  It was all dressing and no greens and we sent it back.  Then we ordered the bone on ribeye ($53) which Scott our waiter highly recommended and 2 side dishes.   The steak was I thought old or something wrong with the quality of the beef.   I had asked Scott to smell it as it had a very nauseous odor to it. I did taste it which was not a normal taste or flavor.  Scott said it was the seasoning that gave it the smell.  He asked if I wanted to have it sent back and I said no so he was fully accommodating to our needs.  I did ask how long the chef has been there which he stated for about a year so obviously the direction that Austin's is heading is not within our tastes.   I would hate to see this restaurant close as it's been there from the beginning but if the direction of the food quality doesn't change it will be in a past tense as there are so many new great places opening up to dine."}
{"text":"Great Food, Absolutely HORRIBLE Service   We went to Austin's Steakhouse on Christmas Eve, and had reservations for 17 people. They put us in one of the back rooms.  The waiter, I don't remember his name, was rude and looked like we were bothering him the entire night. When he gave us our menus, we took one and passed it down, trying to be helpful. He, annoyingly, told us to keep the menu he gives us. Okay buddy, calm down, it's just a menu. After an hour of no one coming to check on us, it was time to order. He started taking our orders next to me and worked his way around the table. The woman next to me, who ordered first, asked if there would be separate checks. She wasn't aware of the one check policy - no problem right? Apparently it was a problem because she got a \"No!\" that was just short of a yell, given with a look of disgust. She ordered her steak, and he went on to the next person, across from me. He got a few people down, and a mother wanted to order for her child, who was seated across the table. Once again, very rudely, he replied with a \"No! I have to go in order!\" He was not accommodating to anyone at all. By the time he got to me, I was the last to order, and he was ruder than when we started. We had to ask for our bread baskets to be refilled, and for more drinks. We saw our waiter only two times in the span of when we got there, 7:30, and the time we ate, which was 9:30.  This brings me to the busboy. My mother, who was seated next to me, had asked the busboy for more water refills. He goes around the table and fills everyone's glass EXCEPT my mother. She once again asks him for more water. He grabs the pitcher, fills up her glass, SLAMS the pitcher on the back table and storms out, glaring at all of us. We were completely shocked.  Two members from our table get up and ask to speak to the manager - who was NO help whatsoever. They complained about the lack of refills on drinks or bread, the rude waiter, and the busboy who threw a tantrum. The manager's response was, \"Well you should have told me what was happening sooner.\" So it's OUR fault for your horrible waiters?  She switched out our busboys and we got one who was actually really nice! He was good, kept checking our waters and everything. He was the only one to even smile at us. FINALLY - after two hours, we get our food. They come in tray after tray, but only our waiter stays, so it's going to take us another half hour to get our food. He goes around the table in order of who he took orders from. He gets to the child (the one who he wouldn't let the mom order for) and gives her the steak she wanted. We're all extremely starving, so we don't blame her when she cuts into her steak and takes a bite, only to find out it wasn't the temperature she wanted it cooked. He mixed up two steaks. He grabs the steak she's already eaten some out of, the medium, causing her fork and steak knife to fall off the plate and almost into her lap and gives her the well done steak she was supposed to have. He goes around the table to another family member, who had ordered the medium, and places the partially already-eaten steak in front of him. My family member looks at the waiter, confused. The waiter, oblivious, replies, \"Oh you want another one?\" We are paying 30+ dollars per steak. He shouldn't have even been offered the eaten steak. It was the waiter's error, not ours. By the time all the steaks come around, he has to distribute the sides and sauces, which was also apparently too difficult for our waiter. By the time we each got our sides, they were cold.  The bill comes, and that was the only time the waiter was actually on time with anything. It was a thousand dollars, which was expected for the 17 of us. The worst part was that $134 of that was gratuity. For what? Just because your gratuity is included in the check, doesn't mean you get to slack off and be completely rude to your table. My cousin, who had dealt with the manager before, takes the bill out and explains that we shouldn't have to pay so much for such a bad experience, especially in gratuity. What does the manager do? Take forty bucks off. She blatantly lies to us and tells us, \"The computer wouldn't let me take off anymore.\" You're the manager, you can override the computer. We aren't stupid.  We pay the bill, it's 10:30, we are ALL ready to leave. As we leave our room, the manager is standing outside in the dining hall wishing us a Merry Christmas. She did not once apologize for anything, she was not helpful, she lied, and then she was trying to be all sweet at the end as we were leaving. I don't think so. If you have a larger group, DO NOT expect good service, or even decent service."}
{"text":"Always a great spot to unwind and relax. A bit pricey and a changed menu but still worth the time and money"}
{"text":"This restaurant was incredible! The Chef greeted us for our reservation and seated us promptly. Our server, Shawn, was friendly, knowledgeable, and made our Anniversary dinner memorable. Shawn provided the perfect recommendations for our meal. He was attentive but allowed the perfect amount of privacy for us to enjoy our time together.  We will definitely be returning to Austin's and asking for Shawn."}
{"text":"What the heck happened here! I have been going here for years about once a month and I would recommend this place to all my friends. About 6 months ago the prices went up and the food quality went way WAY down. They have no idea what the difference between rare, medium rare and medium is. So disappointed. I guess it's back to the strip casinos for a good steak."}
{"text":"The idea is simple: serve USDA prime, and choice steaks with a signature marinade, cooked over mesquite charcoal. Austins Steakhouse, located at Texas Station in North Las Vegas, really knows how to make meat taste good.  Having a vague idea of just how much food they serve around these here parts, we inquired about the special of the evening: a pepper encrusted roast beef. The waiter informed us that the cut was about 2 pounds worth of meat. TWO POUNDS. That's a lotta cow. Not ones to shirk our duties as true meatotarians, we ordered the roast, along with a side of the Austin's potatoes and the spinach and mushrooms.  The roast beef, was in a word, DELICIOUS. The meat was amazingly juicy and tender, flavorful from the crushed pepper rub, and in such vast quantities that the three of us could only finish 3/4 of the plate. It also went quite well with the pile of twice-cooked (fried) potatoes and the surprisingly good combo of sauteed spinach and fresh shitake mushrooms. Additionally we had the deliciously crisp Caesar salad, which came with a classical dressing and parmesan tuile. The quality of the salad was a cut above anything I have ever had in Boston. Sad, but true. For dessert we went for the molten chocolate cake - something I can easily make myself, but still couldn't turn down.  My advice: skip the starch and go for the steak and vegetable options. They may fly the produce in from California, but it arrives on your plate, crisp, flavorful and perfectly cooked.  In addition to some fabulous steaks, Austin's also serves a fine selection of sustainable seafood. Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"Went to Austin's with a group of buddies for my bachlor party, and the management treated us great.  They sent a shuttle to our hotel, had a private room ready for us and had great staff to serve us once we arrived.  The food was very good and for the price was excellent.  The sides too were very good, we had most, adn the steak tartar and oysters stood out above most.  They offered us a great deal on bottles of wine, and made the entire occation one to remember.  Thanks.  I would highlky recommend them and would definately go back with the wife.  WWhile it may not be the best steakhouse in Vegas (perhaps 1 notch below the superstar steakhouses you know from the strip at 1/2 the price), but for the money, it was clearly the best deal and the food was very good as well.  They treat you really well, they appreciate you making your way to their restaurant, and you feel it when you dine.  PS , don't forget the Restaurant.com vouchers, they will possibly let you use more then 1 with larger groups, they did for us!!!"}
{"text":"Two years ago, this was one of my favorite steakhouses off the Strip.  After dining there this New Years Eve, I can say I'll never return.  Positives first...great chopped salad & very good filet.  The scallops were the worst I've ever had.  Rubbery is the only word that describes them.  The Austin's Potatoes were supposed to be topped with carmelized onions.  What we got were undercooked (some actually crunchy) potatoes with regular diced barely cooked onions on top...not even close to carmelized.  The creamed spinach came out the consistency of soup.  You needed a spoon to eat it, and it just tasted like a pool of butter. The servers there used to be fun and vivacious.  Ours had the personality of a doorknob. If you want an off Strip steakhouse at a Station Casino, The Charcoal Room is far better.  Too bad so many restaurants around here lack consistency!"}
{"text":"For the price point we paid for two diners, the quality  of the food could have been better and the server a bit more attentive and engaging... we dropped 100 bills for one glass of wine two entrees and two sides.... and two salads.......  for less than half of what we paid here, we could have had the same if not better quality food for  1/2 the price and way better attentive service at an OutBack steakhouse!  been there twice the third time may not be a CHARM!"}
{"text":"They have the best ribeye in town (and I've tried a lot of other steakhouses). Sean is an awesome server! We always request to be seated in his section."}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW!! I don't know where to begin, this place is the best steakhouse in Vegas bar none!! The pretzel bread they bring you just begins to set the stage ( dip it in the blue cheese sauce that goes on steaks). The ceaser salad is the best I have ever had, yes, I said the best I have ever had! Only to be followed up with the best steak I have ever had, again, the best I have ever had!!!  I am not normally a ribeye guy, I prefer filet, however this ribeye is insanity, so incredible! Also the server Shawn is the man to see, great service consistantly always professional! Check it out guys and girls! you won't be disappointed, I promise!!"}
{"text":"Once a year my husband and I visit Las Vegas for work. We were introduced to Austin's steak House years ago and have not been disappointed since. The food is impeccable, the wine superb, and the staff friendly and knowledgable! We decided to eat dinner at Austin's a few days ago! We were very blessed to have our server who was very knowledgable with the wine list and the meats that would taste best which each wine. His name was Miguel! Managers name is Rob, also very friendly!"}
{"text":"One of the only places in vegas where the butcher's know how to cut a ribeye. I'm from back east. I'm a butcher and boy howdie do the guys make a gooooooooooood ribeye."}
{"text":"The marinated Ribeye is the best is Vegas.  The prices are reasonable for a fine dining restaurant.  The service is sub-par but the food will make up for it!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing! Everything from service to the food was beautiful. I had the porterhouse and it was by far the most exquisite steak I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"This place was the BOMB! Well at least I know for sure the 8oz fillet mignon and the HUMONGOUS LOBSTER TAIL I ordered was ridiculously delicious! Note: everything is alla carte so it can get expensive really quick...but if you do make it there....spoil yourself and order the giant lobster tail....I'm telling you it's worth it!"}
{"text":"First time at Austin's Steakhouse on 8/20/17.  We were a party of 6 and were seated upon arrival at 7:30.  The decor is lovely.  The lighting is low, white table cloths, beautiful place settings.   Our server was Devontae - give him 5 stars!   He took such good care of our group.  He thoroughly explained the specials, answered all of our questions re: food prep, etc.  He made sure to ask if we were celebrating anything special (it was one couple's anniversary).  We definitely appreciated the extra attention from him.  The prices were much lower than steakhouses on The Strip or Downtown Vegas.  We skipped appetizers and salads, but each couple had steak and shared a side. The average price per couple was roughly $55, which I think is inexpensive.  Our food was prepared to each person's specification and was DELICIOUS!!!!  Our server surprised the anniversary couple with a free dessert.  Will definitely visit here again the next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I am puzzled why most casinos feel the need to have a steakhouse--especially locals casinos, where the offerings usually are mediocre and overpriced. Sadly, that was the case at Austin's on our recent visit for Restaurant Week. While the service was impeccable, the food was nothing special and took a big bite out of our wallet.   We were drawn in by the lure of Beef Wellington, which neither my husband nor I had ever had. A staple of '70s dining, I now know why it has lost its luster. Glad I tried it, but I'm not really a fan of a steak wrapped in an unnecessary puff pastry. This is all about presentation and little about flavor, although the steak itself was OK but a bit bland. In contrast, the tuna tartar appetizer had too MUCH flavor. The crispy shallot topping took away from the delicate flavor of the tuna, and there was more cucumber salad than fish on the plate. The final course, a Nutella brownie, tasted like something I could have made at home, and that's not saying much. We split a good, fairly priced bottle of Malbec ($39), but the meal itself was advertised on the Restaurant Week website as being $40 (reasonable) but was, instead, $50 at the restaurant (not worth it for what we got).   As I said, the service was great, and I was so pleased to see our server, Deontae, promote Restaurant Week rather than keep it on the down low (as some restaurants seem to do). Not sure I will visit Austin's again, but I'm glad they participate in Restaurant Week and hope next year's menu will be more in line with most locals' dining-out budgets."}
{"text":"First of all Can I say WOW!?!?!   This is most definitely one the best steakhouses in Las Vegas.  We took a 25 minute limo ride just for one of these juicy steaks!   Their Rib eye and fillet Mignon is to die for so flavorful and juicey!   I came here with my sister's pool team to celebrate the trip.  The service was expedite and the drinks were killer.    The decor was classy however it was in a casino so anything goes.  This place is  must try if in Vegas.  The food was well worth their cost! MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the daily special. Large piece of prime rim cooked to perfection, side of garlic mash potatoes and green beans for $14.99."}
{"text":"When I say I love this place, I love this place. Every time I go to Las Vegas I have to make a trip to Texas station, just to go see Shawn! He such an amazing host and does all he can to make your experience amazing. Probably in the last six months, I've been to Austins 10 times or more and I've never been disappointed with the service. My favorite item on the menu is the ribeye. The twice baked potatoes are amazing! That you have to try! They have one of the best bartenders in Las Vegas. I can't recall her name and I'm beating myself up as I'm writing this because I can't. Just know that if you do decide to order a drink there, they'll take care of you. The pricing is great considering the portions of food you receive! I can't stress enough how good the food is here. This is my favorite steakhouse in the United States!"}
{"text":"Me and my bf had really high hopes for this restaurant but wow were we disappointed. Where to begin:  1) we were told not once but twice to wait 20 minutes before we could get a table even though the place seemed empty  2) when we got the table it took our server more than 10 minutes to get us any bread or water  3) It LITERALLY took our food more than an hour to get to us and when it did it was cold as if it had been sitting for awhile  4) The food was mediocre and for the price we paid, I could have made a steak dinner every night for 3 nights    I don't usually complain but this was just not that great of a meal so I just wont go back there."}
{"text":"Ate there last night with my wife. Promised her I'd leave my phone at home....so no pics...lo siento Anyway Kettle One Martinis...deelish! Pan seared ribeye amazing, petite filet...she loved it...twice baked big and yummy...King Crab dip...wow! Service great and helpful! Thanks to them for recommending the house chopped salad, very yummy.  Oh yea we'll be back! Props to you all...great evening!"}
{"text":"The service was slow. We ordered at 7:20, we got food at 8:25.  The food was cold, cooked incorrectly, and when it was prepared properly it was not seasoned at all. The cuts of meat we fatty and flavorless. Although some in our party thought the food was acceptable, it was still not worth the money we paid for it. The servers were polite and they did remove the cost of one meal that was especially bad, but it did not make up for the poor quality of food. The wine, coffee, and cocktails were good. Also the pretzels offered at the beginning of he meal were awesome! The atmosphere was nice But as far as the steak... Not worth it."}
{"text":"We went there Saturday night.  The food was very good and the atmosphere is cozy and quiet even when the restaurant is crowded.  But the best reason I would tell people to eat here is if you ask for Deontae to be your server.  He made the experience of eating here much better because he is a very pleasant server who did not roll his eyes or take a deep breath after telling him how I wanted our dinner prepared.  He got everything right and was all smiles all the time.  As close to perfect as I would want from a waiter.  I will absolutely ask that I be seated with him as my waiter from now on when I revisit Austin's."}
{"text":"Okay we went here with my husbands family and that makes I think it was 16 of us and the service was INCREDIBLE!!!!!  Not one person had to ask for a refill. They were completely attentive and as there were 4 children among us they were very happy to accommodate dishes for them as well.  If you eat another Rib eye steak please let it be at Austin Steakhouse!!!!!  OMG this was the most wonderfully DELICIOUS steak EVER!!!!  The Lobster Bisque was smooth and creamy with several nice size chunks of lobster unlike many places where you may get two or three slivers. As I could barely eat the entire steak I could just barely manage tastes of a couple sides. I sampled the Sauteed Spinach with Shitake Mushrooms and the White Cheddar Mac & Cheese which were both extremely tasty!!!  A definite return is in order....... and Fathers Day is coming up!"}
{"text":"Came here based on a personal recommendation.... 99.9% will not return. Service was good... Food was...  Crab cakes were ok the beurre blanc was DELICIOUS  mom got ribeye medium temperature cooked perfectly, which was very tasty. Dad got the halibut special it was adequate  I got the filet mignon which was ordered medium temperature but came out medium well/well done. The waiter took it back and like 15 min later a RARE filet came back. I was truly disgusted. The sides twice baked potato and aspargus was delicious. I did not even try the creamed corn gratin... look at my pics and maybe you'll understand why... We were offered dessert for a 2nd chance but declined! I have worked in the food industry the filet should have been compd but whatever, thanks D for the good service. Too bad a manager did not come over to speak to us. Did we get what we paid for? Nahhh."}
{"text":"I ate here with my wife for our anniversary.  My wife had the petite filet and I had their signature dish 22 oz bone-in rib eye.  The filet was awesome, very lean and made the way my wife wanted it.  The rib eye was outstanding, I ate the whole thing.  The armospher is relaxing and the service was second to none.  If you got the dime to spend, this is the place.  Man! I can't beleive I ate the whole steak.  It was that good!!!!"}
{"text":"My mom and I went here for dinner. It is located in a locals casino, Texas, close to home. Our server Shawn was AWESOME!!!  He gets 5 stars!!   My mom and I ordered rib eye and my steak was horribly overcooked (hence the 4 stars). Shawn jumped right on getting it corrected. He also was very knowledgeable about the wine selection. He apologized a million times and came back to check on us 2 million times!    Austins Management, Shawn is the only reason I will come back. The quality of the meat was good and flavor was ok. But the service and care he provided was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Johnny our waiter is top notch.   Had a great Thanksgiving there and decided to go back for Xmas.  Thanks for the excellent service Johnny!  See you soon!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Texas Station is truly a \"locals\" casino, with your standard coffee shop, buffet and fast food picks, but nothing compares to Austin's Steakhouse. The atmosphere is a bit dark, romantic really, it has never been super busy which could be bad, but in our case it made the food come out faster and hotter! We ordered salmon and a NY steak, mac and cheese, baked potatoes and sautéed spinach. What an excellent meal. The service that Shawn and John provided was excellent. In fact, they took care of us so well, that I made a phone call to the Food and Beverage director to let them know how well they performed. I am not surprised though that he never called me back. That is so rude and unappreciative towards the staff I think. Anyways, go check this hidden gem out and let me know what you think. I love it!"}
{"text":"We ate here OMG! I had a beautifully cooked & very tasty steak, med rare, creamed spinach, loaded baked potato. Amazing food, service & ambience!"}
{"text":"The service and the food were really great. The steaks are great in both taste as well as tenderness. The sides such as sauteed mushrooms and baked potatoes are good also. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone living or just visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Left the strip looking for a better price on a good steak.  Location is 15-25 mins from the strip (depending on traffic) and is located inside of a rather old casino.  Decor was nice and table/chairs were comfortable.  Menu was small.  14oz strip was $32 and sides were $ 7 a piece (but enough for two people).  So, not inexpensive, but food quality was very high.  Strip steak was cooked perfectly and had a full flavor and good texture.  All in all, a good steak, though not easily gotten to and somewhat overpriced."}
{"text":"Have not been back to Austin in years- decide to try it  again. The service was good, the prime rib was delicious. Would not recommend the main entree of  scallops- was horrid.  No seasoning- just put in a dish with way too much clarified butter.  Found  the menu was  limited."}
{"text":"Hubby and I like to go there for prime rib.  The roast is great, one of the best I've had in Vegas.  Not to mention, the price is right...  Queen is $24 and king is about $28.  However, the last 3 times I have been there, they have been out of prime rib.  They open at 5:00 p.m.  Just last week, I was there at 7pm and they were out.  #Bummed"}
{"text":"I came here just before Christmas with my family. We were all craving red meat.  Hidden in the Texas Station Hotel and Casino is Austin's Steakhouse, what was a pleasant surprise. It's is one of the best, if not the best, steakhouses in the city. I had the Rib-eye. It was cooked to perfection. It was huge. We fed of that for two days after. We ordered some side dishes. The macaroni and cheese with truffles was delicious. My niece had the chopped salad, which she enjoyed immensely. We all loved are meals."}
{"text":"Superb food at low cost.  An unexpected surprise.  Go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Found Way North of the Strip, in The Texas Station Casino. A buddy of mine, did some research and found that this place had an extensive and interesting history. Something about the original recipes and cooking methods of the steaks were passed from generations. It started from a shack and high demand eventually brought it to where it is today.. Well, whatever lets have some Steak!  Austins Chopped Salad: This thing is Jaw Dropping! Comes in a mound of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, avocado, bacon and the dressing is creamy buttermilky/bleucheesy.. Just the right amount of everything!  Rib Eye Steak: Pretty Good but I have tried plenty Better. Not a bad steak but comparing to other steak housesI've encountered, its not that memorable in my opinion.   Sides: Baked Potato, Spud Potatoes with Garlic, Steamed Asparagus and Sauteed Button Musrooms - Names speak for themselves, nothing special but all accompany the steak well.  An A-Okay Steak House, I guess if your in the neighborhood and your feeling steak or want an Incredible Salad then its worth a visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here often. He is from Texas, and I Nebraska - so we are Steak SNOBS! It blows us away every, single, time! They offer so many sides and desserts it is really hard to choose. TRY THE MAC AND CHEESE. you won't regret it. After visiting nearly every steakhouse in this city... this is still our favorite!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service for my volleyball team! All the girls had a great dinner! Johnny took great care of us all! Thanks for a Great team dinner!"}
{"text":"My boys took me here for dinner during my bachelor party.  Ordered filet mignon rare and it tasted like heaven.  Reminds me of when i eat good maguro sushi, melts in your mouth.    Creamy spinach was the best side.  Apart from this meal, I don't remember anything else that happened that weekend."}
{"text":"Best steak EVER !!!! Okay service, quiet eating.... Okay service... Can't wait to eat here again"}
{"text":"This place was good, but inconsistent. Went on Wednesday night with a party of 7, at 730. We had resos, but the place wasn't busy. Still, make a reservation just in case. Anyways I will list everything I tried by course. So here it goes:  Appetizers Crab cakes- I didn't care for these. There wasn't much crab in them at all. Only 2 come in an order.   Bacon wrapped shrimp - the bacon was burnt! I like crispy bacon, but it was black. The shrimp were large but the burnt bacon ruined it.   Calamari - the best app in my opinion. Came with a marinara sauce for dipping.   Salad Chopped salad- this has bacon, gorgonzola, avocado, and it was tossed in a blue cheesey dressing. It was good!   Caesar- standard Caesar. Came with some kind of fried cheese on the side that was deelicious!   Spinach - not good. It had beets on it and a weird dressing.   Entrées  King crab legs - I love crab. These were split open for easy eating. They came with melted butter, which was unfortunately cold.   Ribeye- my favorite part of the meal. Absolutely delicious.   Lobster tail- second favorite part of the meal. The lobster was sweet and buttery. It melted in my mouth. I usually don't care for lobster, but this changed my  opinion on it. Would definitely order again   Filet mignon - pretty good. I still think my ribeye was better.   Sides  Creamed spinach - delicious and cheesey  Asparagus - cooked in butter. Pretty good  Sautéed mushrooms - tasted great with my steak   Sauces  Peppercorn - I didn't like this at all  Bernaise - tasty and complemented the steak well  Dessert  Creme Brulee- this was good, but nothing special   All in all it was a good meal, but many of our items were inconsistent. Like the burnt bacon wrapped shrimp. My grandma's NY steak was ice cold and had to be reheated. The Creamed spinach although tasty, wasn't hot enough. The melted butter was cold. For the price we were paying, there shouldn't have been as many mistakes as there was."}
{"text":"Best prices in Vegas for top notch service, food & variety  Apps are yummy - good for two to share & only 9.00!!! Better than MOST I have had in far more expensive steakhouses on the strip for 20 & 30.00 each!!  KNOW THAT!  Steak is always tasty, prepared perfectly, hot & seasoned  Sides are only 6.00 and amazing and sharable Try the awesome green beans almondine and mac and cheese  Caprese salad is one of the best I have had in 15 years in Vegas  Best experience for the price hands down in Vegas"}
{"text":"We had reservations for a special dining experience for our 20th wedding anniversary this week. A family member had spoken highly of this establishment. We arrived on time and were seated only after a few minutes of the employees working the shift discussing an issue at the entryway desk. Robert was our server and he was nice and polite. I  was shocked by the condition of the beef we were served, gristle and tough prime rib which we had to wrestle to cut, $29. How can a baked yam be $8? The baked potato was so overcooked and dry. The lobster chowder had a nice look but only a few actual lobster bits in the center of the huge bowl. The chopped salad was wonderful. The creme brulee was superb. I find it funny that the salt and pepper grinders are placed on the farside of the large round table, out of each of our reach. How could you possibly be the place rated \"Las Vegas NV number one steakhouse\" ??? This was the worst spent $150.00 SHAME ON YOU Austin's Steakhouse. -10"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good steakhouse considering its location.  As far as I'm concerned, this is the best place in Vegas for the value.  I usually sit at the bar and the staff there are amazing.  I wouldn't do the bleu cheese coating on the smaller steaks however (small filet, etc), the flavor is a bit overpowering.  Important tip: Austin's usually has gift certificates on restaurant.com with very generous terms.  (Minimum $30 spend for a $20 cert)  If you can get a discount code for the site, that means you can usually get a $20 cert for about $4-5."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere in the restaurant although it is located right next to a pawn shop. Lots of dodgy folks hanging out. Food was ok. I thought it was a bit over priced. I ordered a Filet Mignon and they asked if I wanted rice or fries.  Really? The steak costs over $35 and you want to serve it with fries? Come on man!!! Steak was good but not $35 good. I wanted the entire meal experience for a upper end restaurant but it was a bit of a letdown."}
{"text":"While looking on the internet for a good steakhouse in Vegas, I came across Austin's. What a find! Don't let the less than desirable locale stop you from giving this place a try. Not only is the food delicious, it's very reasonably priced.  What we had - To start, they bring you a basket of different types of bread. All very good but the pretzel bread was the best! Salad - while there were several to choose from, my husband and I split the wedge salad. It was fantastic! it was covered in crumbled bacon, chopped tomatoes and onions, blue cheese dressing and crumbles.  Main Course - The reviews I read said to order the rib-eye so my brother and I split it (22 ounces!)  It was tender and really flavorful and worth the $36 price tag. My husband and sister in law each ordered the petite filet at $27. My sister in law said it was \"like buttah\".  Side Dishes - they are ALL $6 each which, if you go to any high end steakhouse on the Strip, run anywhere from $12 to $15 each. We had the creamed corn which had bits of jalapeno peppers in it, french fries, and gorgonzola mashed potatoes. All quite tasty and plenty to split between the 4 of us.  Dessert - we were there to celebrate my brother and sister in law's birthdays so they received complimentary creme brulee's, but our waiter, Shawn, mentioned that he loved the apple crisp so I ordered that and was very happy I did. It was in phyllo dough and the apples were perfectly cooked and the topping was fabulous. Probably one of the best apple crisps I've ever had ( and I've had a lot of apple crisps!)   Shawn also mentioned that if you go on restaurant.com, there are deals to be had for our next visit which is something I'll check out the next time I'm headed to Vegas (FYI, Restaurant.com is on Ebates.com which gives you rebates when you purchase through them so check that out!)  After all was said and done, it was less than $50 per person for an exceptional steak dinnerl! Now THAT'S a deal!"}
{"text":"Well let's start with the good. The decor and ambience were great. This is a really beautiful restaurant. The bread basket has a lot of tasty breads and the shrimp cocktail was good.   The bad. This is probably one of the slowest restaurants I have ever been to. We were going to a movie that night and decided to catch dinner beforehand. We got to the restaurant 2 hours before the movie was supposed to start and missed our movie.  Do not, I repeat, do not order the prime rib. They only serve it medium or more. My husband ordered the medium but it was definitely well done. The guy at the next table had the same problem. I had the new york strip and it was everything from medium to rare, no consistent temp throughout. All the sides are additional. For $85 for 2 people I expect better."}
{"text":"Was a little disappointed in the meal. Had the porterhouse  steak, grilled asparagus & twice baked potato. Steak was cooked right but was very bland, no flavor. I was expecting a mouthwatering.  Melt in your mouth steak. Service was a little on the slow side and they where not even busy. At least the asparagus was good but it could have used some seasoning also."}
{"text":"Didn't expect it to be that great but was pleasantly surprised.  The bone in ribeye is a must.  Cooked perfectly to temp and seasoned well.  Started with the onion soup and it delivered as well.  Got a side of seasoned fries and they were also done right.  We were pretty much the only people there and had to wait a little while but other than that, a great experience.  Unfortunately it's located in the Texas Station, but if you find yourself here like me, it's a safe bet."}
{"text":"It's yet another steakhouse.   Excellent service. Better be when you're paying the price for dead cow that they charge.   Ambiance was nice. Dimly lit and quiet unlike some other steak houses I've been to. Made for easier conversation with the parental units who I took to dinner as part of the ritual when someone gets a new job or promotion in our family.   Only gripe I had was that my father asked to have an appetizer shrimp order brought out with his meal. The cooks obviously didn't time it right because when the food was served, the shrimp was bordering on being dry, possibly from sitting under heat lamps while the steaks were being cooked.   Otherwise, location isn't bad - it's not on the strip so you don't have worry about reservations (at least we didn't) and you don't get the loud and obnoxious diners who want to show off that they either won or have money and are celebrating by eating an expensive steak dinner."}
{"text":"Went there Sunday for a retirement dinner for a fellow employee. Party of seven.   First time at Austin's. Great steakhouse feel with subdued lighting, high-backed leather chairs. We were seated promptly and beverage orders taken. One slight hitch in the service was they had one waiter servicing the entire room. Mind you, it wasn't terribly busy but really one guy?  BTW he did a good job with our party.   I speak to what I ordered. King-cut prime rib, rare. It came out hot and cooked as requested. The one take away is too much fat on the piece. I enjoy a well marbled cut but this was a tad too much. About a third was non edible.    Apart from the criticism of the prime rib, service was good and it was an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Okay I am going to start out with the steak was really good. However they lost a star because the service could have been better. For a Monday night it took them over an hour to get our order. Our main server totally ignored us most of the night. I guess to make up for that, his serving assistant was very attentive. Well at least most of the food made up for the poor service.  I'd have to say my petite filet was cooked perfectly medium rare. The mac and cheese is really good but somewhat rich and I'd recommend sharing it. In fact, since they are a la carte, most of the side dishes are easily shared between two people. The grilled asparagus with balsamic glaze could have been a bit better. The giant spears they used were tough and woody. My boyfriend ordered the Potatoes Austin. They were sort of like Lyonnaise Potatoes, \"but without the bacon\" as I was corrected by the server. The last time I looked I had never made it with bacon. Anyway, everyone else at the table got the Porterhouse. My mom said it was terrific, as were the sauteed mushrooms she had as a side dish. Not so good were my uncle's french fries, but I attribute that to him getting french fries at a steak joint. If it had said \"steak frites\" I would have had a higher standard for them.  I think the entire dining experience was about three hours. The food was good but the service was lacking. I'll say that for being a casino restaurant it was above average. Surprisingly enough the noise from the casino was mostly indiscernible."}
{"text":"Good food great  price the only problem is the sound of the casino in the background"}
{"text":"This was an amazing steakhouse, the food was delicious and fresh! I got the 38 dollar steak and it was worth every cent.. It was amazing, tender and the sauce was to die for. The waiters were all on it, my water was never empty and they were fast bringing out your food! They were also very very nice! I highly recommend this steakhouse if you are craving a big steak! It's fantastic"}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted to try this place and so we did. For being inside the Texas Station, it was a nice surprise. We've been back a few times now and each time the service is wonderful but this last time it really stood out. Shawn has taken care of a couple times and his service is always prompt and great. They were one man short so the hostess and even Chef were on the floor checking on everyone and making sure they were taken care of. Which I thought was wonderful. On to the food. We have ordered the Caesar salad and shrimp cocktail to start which are delicious. And I usually order the filet mignon while my boyfriend orders the porterhouse. They're so juicy and cooked to perfection. They also have a wonderful peppercorn sauce for the steak if desired, that's my favorite. We've ordered mashed potatoes, corn and spinach for sides which we also can't complain about. The ambiance is nice. It's never overly crowded unless of course it's Valentines Day so you can almost always find a table. It's a good little unexpected spot if you desire a good steak without the pain of driving to the strip or being in an overly expensive and crowded restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place to have dinner with your BFF!! I went here and had dinner last night with my friend to celebrate my bday (which is today). We were there for about 2 hours and it was relaxing. They gave me a creme brulee for dessert with a candle on it, so I got to make a wish =). and it was on the house, which was nice of them!  Parking:  I parked on the lot. Parking garage and valet available also.  Reservations: I had one at 6pm, I rolled in at 610pm, and the hostess was cheerful and friendly and did not give me crap about being late! Open from 5-10 Sunday -Thursday Open from 5-11 Friday and Saturday  Service/Waitstaff: Very attentive and very friendly. We asked to take pictures and did not even hesitate, and made sure it was good enough to post on my FB lol!  I ordered: -Jumbo bacon wrapped shrimp for appetizer (see picture) -Jumbo lump crab cocktail (see picture) - Petite Fillet Mignon - 8oz (well done) see picture; butterflied - Asparagus - grilled with reduced, creamy balsamic sauce of some sort, loved it! - Mashed potatoes with gorgonzola  Wine: I had 2 glasses of Cabernet, and it was good, can't remember which one it was, I know it wasn't the Napa Valley one though. It's first on the menu.  Overall for 2 people, without tip was $125.  Next time, I will have to NOT get my meat WELL done...because it was dry, which I am not using against them since I made that decision to go dry =P   5 of 5 stars! =)"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite steakhouse in Vegas!!! The rib-eye is phenomenal alone, but add the rib-eye sauce they have and it is slap your momma good!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding, for the most part.  The oysters?  I ordered a dozen oysters that were allegedly from Washington State and \"excellent.\"  What I got was crappy gulf oysters, which I wouldn't feed to a goldfish.    After that, I didn't expect much.  However, when the Ribeye came, I was stunned with how good it was.  The Ribeye was a beautiful cut.  Cooked to perfection.  Delicious.    I would give it 4 stars, even with the shitty oysters, except it should lose a lot of points for being in Texas Station.  Texas Station is a trash hellhole of a dump.  As delicious as the steak was, and even though they don't allow smoking in the restaurant, so much cigarette smoke wafts in from the casino floor, that you may as well be eating your steak in a coal mine.    So, if they move out of this dump of a casino, you should consider this to be a 4 star review.  But, I would never, ever, actually go to this place, as wonderful as it is, since you've got to travel through a trailer-park-dweller casino to get there, and you've got to breathe toxic crap air while you eat it."}
{"text":"Oh what to say about you. Well it was date night for the hunny and I. We wanted to try something different decided to venture to the other casinos on the north side. Anyways there was one hostess, one runner and one server. Being in the industry you can pick out who does what quite quickly. Miguel, our server was very nice but his section was definitely too big for him tonight. It wasn't busy but 10 tables was a little too much for this guy. We placed our order which began with calamari and oysters Rockefeller (pics below). Loved the oyster, not so much the calamari. One thing that I found odd was that the calamari was served with peperonchini peppers with no tartar or marinara. It was also pretty bland and chewy. Like I said not my favorite. I inadvertently order a Cobb salad as well because my reflex thought it came with a side salad. It was too late to ask him to cancel it so the hunny said let it be. When the salad arrived the presentation was very nice on a glass plate but with the first bite...well that was a whole other story. Too much dressing, too much blue cheese..ick! Miguel came by and asked if we were going to finish the salad and we replied no. He asked us if we liked it and I replied that I did not enjoy the salad for the following reasons and he said alright.   So the hunny got a porter house and I got the prime rib which was the highlight of the meal I would have to applaud them for. Meat was the perfect temp. Very tender steaks. The bill came out to 125.40 for two apps, a salad, two steak entrees, two sides, and  two glasses of wine. Not bad. I would have liked it if Miguel would have taken the salad off due to my disliking but I think he was too busy with the other 9 tables that was I. His section. Again, the food was good but the speed of the food definitely was also lacking.   TLDR: Good steaks, slow food, weird calamari"}
{"text":"I'd give this more stars except for the pompous attitude. Lemme explain, I like ketchup and mustard with my burgers, mayonnaise with my tuna fish so when I ask for A-1 with my steak I don't deserve to get scolded by my waiter. \"hey buddy, last time I checked I'm the one paying for this meal an your tip\" it's not an offense to the chef or an affront to you, I like what I like so get some A-1 and put it in a fancy holder just lemme enjoy my expensive meal the way I want to...

Wow I ask to be helped no answer from the waiter at all I ask to speak with a manager no answer just walked away like I was not there... Please don't eat here just because of my skin does not mean my money is no good.. Thank you P.S I could be mistaken for a Hispanic man.. Us light skin brothas"}
{"text":"What a great food establishment hidden away in Texas station. Superb service - excellent food and love the crab legs ! I don't even like BEETS however they have the BEST beet salad! You definitely have to try it !"}
{"text":"First let's speak to the service. Service was the worst I have ever had. The server made my party of 15 feel like we were inconveniencing him. Was rude and the one that poured the water even slammed one of our glasses down as if we were making him do extra work by asking for more water. I would not recommend this place to anyone. The food was OK but not worth the almost 1000 bill we had that night. It came out cold... The waiter gave 2 steaks to the wrong people in the party. One of them started eating it and the other one noticed it was wrong.  The waiter swapped the steaks and expected the steak that had an already bite in it to be eaten by the other person. Now why would I want to eat my $50 steak and it already have a bite out of it from another person?  It was just ridiculous.  Not worth the 18% gratuity. also mention that in order to get drink refills and nore drinks we had to go get someone to help because our server never checked on us. You would think a large party like that would  e taken care of.The manager did take 35 off our bill but for everything it was not money well spent at all. Needless to say I will take our yearly 15 people Christmas eve dinner elsewhere next year. Will not return."}
{"text":"Very classy. White tablecloths, dark romantic atmosphere, quiet (even when it's crowded).  Sorry...Not good for children. Waiters are very friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, professional. They can accommodate larger parties (I've seen parties of 12). Ask the servers about off-menu appetizers, entrees, and desserts. The kitchen looks out into the dining room, and it is a very quiet kitchen. The waiters knowhow much time it takes to cook menu items,  so the cooks never gave to yell , \"table 10\" or \"pick up\" , because the waiter is right there when the food is ready. I notice these little things. You must get the Austin's salad... I love it! The lobster tails are cooked right, and the waiter offers to take it off the shell (honestly...I don't know who would want to negotiate the shell). Steaks are very good. The food is very good, which explains the price... It's rather expensive. For one person - an appetizer, salad, entree, and dessert, will easily run $100, and that's without wine or drinks. All-in-all....Very good : )"}
{"text":"Had thanksgiving dinner here, food was delicious and full of flavor. Everyone was very friendly and the atmosphere was welcoming. The kale salad was new to use and it was delicious, had bacon in it and that made it soooo much better!!! Bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Austins for a few years now, mainly for special occasions. Since fathers day was coming I made reservations requesting a booth. We arrive and first of all the hostess makes us wait while she finishes doing something else, the greeting was horrible, but what made us leave the restaurant was that they sat us down on a table, I told the hostess we requested a booth, she goes and checks comes right back and says \"we don't have a booth it will be either this table or this table\" really? Good food but horrible customer service"}
{"text":"I want to recognize Stephanie who was working as a front of house hostess tonight on 1/13/17. We arrived at oyster bar next door to Austin's steak house, and it was busy, a lot of empty tables with used dishes on them but not enough staff to clear tables for my family and I to sit. After watching us arrive, and noticing we were standing for about 20 minutes and not been helped yet, she made sure her station was Unoccupied, then came over and cleared a table for my family and I, and she notified our waitress of us after being seated. Who knows how long it would have taken before we were seated by staff that was too busy to pay attention to guests arriving. We wanted to tip Stephanie, how ever after arriving at 930pm, and Being SERVED At 11pm.  By the time we were done Austin steak house was closed and she was gone. So hopefully she will be recognized for this accolade about her. Thank you kindly Stephanie at Austin's steak house."}
{"text":"Best bone in rib eye, red wine, delicious sides, all for under 50 bucks? this place is so worth the turn around trip to Vegas. Rib eye always cooked juicy and bloody, my favorite and so much flavor. Make sure to ask for all the different sauces cuz those are yummy too. I've been here a couple of times, and each time was so satisfying and we always got good news here, friend is pregnant, someones engaged, etc. I love austins and this is my numero uno steakhouse, all flavor, no BS!"}
{"text":"I am happy to say that Austin Steakhouse treated us great this time arougrnd. Service was great. Food was fantastic. I had the top sirloin mediun rare & cooked perfectly. The bread us always great too."}
{"text":"The service is top notch, Joseph was there when we needed him to be and not when we didn't! He was helpful and professional.  We recommend the steaks or the catch of the day. Make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Wow...what can I say about Austin's?  It's to die for...the best steak that I've EVER  had.  I don't know about the filets but I'm a ribeye fan and it is by far the BEST ribeye I've ever had.  Better than Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Houston's, Lawry's and all those other fancy steakhouses in all the fancy hotels in Vegas.  At first, you don't think much of the place because it's in Texas Station Hotel which isn't the nicest looking hotel.  After you enter the restaurant, it's like you're in a different place.  It has a dark cozy feel.  The service is very prompt and attentive. Now about the food....  My boyfriend and I always split the pan seared ribeye because it's huge and the flavor is so good.  No steak sauce needed.  It comes in a delicious brown sauce and it just melts in your mouth.  By far, the BEST flavor.  We always get lobster tails which are always cooked to perfection and are large.  Some places overcook their lobster tails and they're kinda like rubbery or mushy if it's not fresh.  Not at Austin's...the tails are perfectly seasoned and taste fresh.  For sides, we usually get the garlic mashed potatoes which are good and the green beans almandine which is EXCELLENT.  Desserts are also good as well.  Creme brulee is extra creamy and the mango sorbet is very refreshing. Variety of wines. Everything is excellent there but the PAN SEARED RIBEYE is what stands out the most.  If you're a ribeye fan or not....you definitely need to try it.   We ALWAYS make a trip to Austin's when we go to Vegas because I still haven't found ANY place in So Cal that makes their steaks like this."}
{"text":"Returned to Austin's after more than a year away.  Austin's was our 5 star Las Vegas Steakhouse for many years until a disappointing New Years Eve experience last year.  We have been disappointed by the poor service and so-so food in the past.  On this recent trip, the food regained some leverage with us but the service was still sub par.  Food (4 stars) - Wife had the Ribeye [rare] which is what won us over years ago.  Sad to say that although it was a great cut and was super juicy, it just lacked the off the chart flavor we remember.  It's almost like they are not dry aging it as long as they've done in the past or have cut back on the \"fat\" when pan searing it.  I had the NY Strip [med rare] and was very pleased with the flavor, nice cut of meat and the seasoning was right on; nicely charred with the unique smokey flavor only possible with wood fired grilling.  Service (3 stars) - poor showing by the wait staff, albeit we were there on a Monday night but I would still be expected not to be sit down without a menu or any interaction for 5 minutes.  Especially on a slow night.  Waiter was obviously a newbie, didn't know anything about the food, didn't sell anything, and for the love of pete if you have a terrible menu there is no shame in writing down your orders, it's a lot less annoying than coming back to clarify the order.  3 stars means we'll be back as the steak is still very good and the biggest draw for the place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had gone to Austins a couple times before but not recently. We hit big at the roulette table and figured we were over due for some Austins. After a few probing questions (\"what happened to the pork chops?\") our waiter admitted there were some changes to Austins. Unfortunately Austins 2.0 isn't as good as before:  First; they changed their menu. Sure they dropped their prices (of course that's good!) but they removed a few items. The pork chops there were my boyfriends favorite! Poof. No more.   Second; the quality. Since pork chops were out we both opted for the petite filet. Both wanted it medium rare. The steak served to my boyfriend was a perfect MR while mine was well well done (he was a sweetheart and traded with me!). Also, I upgraded to the lobster chowder and while it was good...the taste/texture of the lobster was eh.   Lastly; portions. I agree with everyone - the pretzel bread is delish! - but before they use to leave the basket at the table...allowing you to stuff yourself silly before the meal ultimately resulting in leftovers. Now they ask what you want and leave just a teaser. And the veggies that accompanied my steak seem fewer than before. (I could be nit-picking).  Now for the positives! The service is excellent and the decor, warm and comfortable. Although one of our steaks was over done the other was pretty tasty and everything came out in a timely manner. Despite my negativity we will most likely eat here again."}
{"text":"I can't begin to say enough about this place! We went out for a dinner date night and sat at the bar while we waited for our table. FYI even with reservations there will be a wait but it is worth it. The bartendar was awesome my girlfriend and I'll thought for a moment that we would eat dinner at the bar but glad we didn't.  We were sat at the booth right across from the bar and we received double service all night! The food was incredible I had the ribeye with gorganzola and it was perfection. We didn't get them but their king crab legs are huge! The next day I enjoyed the ribeye and it was just as delicious!  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was at Austin's many years ago--in excess of 10--so it's been awhile.  The rating is between a three and a four but I've rounded it to three.  My server was Shawn and he was excellent.  He gave me the menu and then explained three of the night's specials.  After pondering for some time, I ordered lobster chowder, the 22 ounce ribeye steak special, and a twice baked potato.    The chowder is a cream based soup with corn, potatoes, bacon, and some lobster meat placed in the center of the bowl.  Great cream soup with a lack of lobster you'd normally get with lobster bisque.  The steak was ordered black and blue and while it was fairly rare inside, it could have been a little less done. The twice baked potato--almost a throwback on menus today--was very good.  A huge baker that had been mashed, seasoned, and put back into the shell of the potato--some now cut away--and loaded with cheese.  Dessert was a let down.  First, there were only 5 things from which to choose and second the carrot cake I got was a bit dry.  I do like the room a lot.  There are no TVs, their bar is in the casino so the drinkers and noise makers are out there.  There is no door separating the room from the casino, but no sound from the casino could be heard.  I really liked having dinner without seeing a bar with multiple TVs--basically a sports bar-- and seeing people around the bar having happy hour small plates.  The room is nicely appointed.  Shawn was an excellent server.  He had good answers for my questions and he steered me correctly in deciding on some things to order.  A little work on the grilling and desserts and this would definitely be a four star steak house.  They also have free wifi!"}
{"text":"If visiting, quite a drive away from the strip.  Restaurant at an older casino. Rib eye was good.  Porterhouse..okay.   Lobster bisque - on the salty side."}
{"text":"I love Austin's so much that I eat there at least once a month. Sure, it's a bit pricey, but for the quality of food you get it is more than worth it. Las Vegas has some of the best \"big name\" celebrity chef steakhouses (and I've eaten at most of them), but Austin's is the place I keep going back to chow down on crazy delicious meat.   Ask any local carnivore what their favorite steakhouse in town is and the answer is always \"Austin's.\" Be prepared to drop $75 - $100 on dinner (without wine) but when you think about it, that's only $30 or so more than we spend when we eat at crappy Outback and I'd much rather have a ginormous ribeye or filet for a little more cash. This place will fill your belly but also impress your date with its cool decor.  I have never had an improperly cooked steak here. I usually eat the filet mignon and it's always a great cut of meat and very tender. Austin's grills on over wood so you get a really tasty flavor and beautiful grill marks. The side dishes are good too (I am fond of the grilled asparagus with balsamic vinegar and the creamed spinach).   The bread basket is a big weakness of mine; their pretzel bread is so good. Pair that with an Austin's steakhouse chopped salad (bacon, avocado, tomatoes, blue cheese) and it's all good! I would also recommend the crab cocktail appetizer; it's big enough to share. In fact, most of their sides and salads are large enough for 2 to share.   The service is always good, friendly and unhurried. I also love that Austin's has two unusual things for a casino restaurant: 1. there is a bathroom right in the restaurant (so you don't have to leave and walk out of the dining room to wash your hands or pee) and 2. they have delicious fresh brewed iced tea (no gross instant tea mix).  This place is out in North Las Vegas so it is never busy, so you don't need to make a reservation. And I love that is is super casual. Jeans are fine to wear, although the atmosphere is \"cowboy swanky.\" And be sure to check restaurant.com for a savings certificate before you go; I've never had an issue redeeming them here."}
{"text":"After all the hype I had been hearing from my co-workers about this place I decided to give it a chance. It was such a blah experience that I still don't know how I feel about it. I think what bugged me the most about dining here was that things keep disappearing from our table, and not just dishes that we were done with.       When we got there our hostess seated us and was kind enough to put our napkins in our laps. She took the cool napkin rings with her so I didn't get a chance to check them out. The table had awesome charger plates, but I didn't even notice when they were swiped. I can understand taking the wine glasses but I was super peeved when the bus person took my fork I was using to pluck the lemons from my iced tea. (Because of course he kept bringing my tea with them in there.) He also grabbed my knife, I just hope they didn't go back into the clean dish pile because they were dirty.       I learned my lesson from the previous steak house I visited to order my meat a little more cooked than I want in order to get it the way I want it. So I asked for medium well and filleted but it was still pink, blah. Hubby got the New York medium well and it looked rare inside but burnt on the outside. For appetizers we had the sliders and the hubby ate a whole plate full of bacon wrapped shrimp. Had we known that the apps were so giant we probably would have just stuck with them and skipped the steaks all together.  I could not tell if the fries that came with the sliders were over cooked or just meant to be crispy but they were so good it was really tough to let them get snatched up by the over eager busser.      The atmoshpere was nice, the decor well appointed and the place was fairly closed off from the noise of the casino.  The booths are very intimate because while the tables are large the round part of the bench is not and you are forced to sit close to your honey.  Over all it's fairly priced with other steak joints I've visited (which honestly are not many)  however, I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Had a poor dining experience here last night. Although the ambiance was fine (the noise from the casino was indiscernible), poor food quality/prep doomed the meal. My colleague ordered salmon. I ordered the house specialty, bone in-ribeye (which carried a hefty premium). We both eschewed the $24 prix fixe menu, opting instead for the regular dinners which include choice of soup or mixed greens salad and chef's choice vegetable.   After ordering we were served a bread basket which included two small pretzel bread sticks and two mini ciabbata. The pretzel bread was disappointing, doughy and not flavorful. The ciabbata was fine.  Salad arrived. Greens consisted of iceberg only, small, with 2 miniature (cherry size) pear tomatoes three slices of cucumber and a couple red onion rings. Although the dressings were ok, iceberg is not acceptable for a house salad unless specified. My main course: I ordered the steak Pittsburgh. It was thick (over an inch) came more medium than blue (probably they cannot keep the grill hot) and was the toughest steak I have ever had from a supposed steakhouse. Tougher even than Outback. Note that Austin's does not advertise aged beef - it clearly wasn't. Had problems cutting it with the steak knife. Moreover, though the seasonings and the sauce were tasty, the beef lacked flavor. I didn't bother to take out the leftovers. My friend's main course: he ordered the grilled salmon. It was overcooked, meaning gray and dry throughout and portions of it had been oversalted. The vegetable served was thin string beans. They too were tough. I also ordered creamed spinach a la carte. This was the best thing we had, but lacked flavor as well (no salt or nutmeg), but, hey it had cream and butter in it, so how bad could it be. This was my first and last visit. I had heard that Austin's was expensive and good. Looks to me like they lowered the prices and the quality of their meats and preparation. Be advised."}
{"text":"Group of 5.  Two petite filet, one filet, one strip, one surf and turf.  Above average prices.   Petit filet, strip, surf and turf and filet overcooked one grade.  1 petit filet perfect.  Sides: sauteed lump crab, spinach, bisque x2.    Crab sautee is just ...meh.  Looks like lump crab mixed in with salsa.  sauteed spinach was good.   Winner was surf and turf.  Lobster tail dwarfed steak about two, almost three times.  Good size.   Wine selection adequate.   - No military/1st responder discount.  (insert joke about Texas being a patriotic state...)  - Service was ...not remarkable.   Water guy was more attentive than waiter."}
{"text":"Located in Texas Station Hotel Casino. What's that you say? No more great deals in Las Vegas? Well, rest easy cherub, how does 15 smackers for a steak (a real steak, none of that crapola some are trying to pass off as prime) a fully loaded baked potato and vegetable, grab you. Everyday from 5 to 6 you can score this deal. So stop complaining, get off your duff and head over to Texas Station and dig in! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"I recently dined at Austin's Steakhouse for a special occasion. The food was good but not outstanding. Our waiter had the personality of a rock; he didn't crack a smile even once during our dining experience, and actually made it somewhat unpleasant. I had the petite filet mignon and was unimpressed. It was a little bit on the dry side. The meal was expensive and I felt it wasn't worth it. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Best steak and Ribeye i ever had was from this place.  you dont even have to order sides because you probably wont even finish the steak cause its so huge and juicy and flavorfull.  Expensive but to me, you get what you pay for and these steaks are worth what they a charging."}
{"text":"I'd like to review the bar portion (A Bar) of this restaurant at this time, and I'll come back to the restaurant part at a later date.   First of all, the bar here is pretty nice. I like the feel of the place, and it has more of a lounge feel than a bar feel. I don't know if that makes sense, but what I mean to say is that the chairs are more comfortable, service comes to you, and it's not a place you pop into for one drink and you're gone in thirty seconds.   Secondly, they seem to have a pretty decent bartender there all the time. So while some of the other bars inside the Texas do ok, this place blows them out of the water. Also, they seem to have higher-end alcohol here. Again, it's in sharp contrast to the other bars here.   Finally, they have a great selection of food to dish out. Not only do they have sliders and the like, but they can also serve anything from the restaurant if you ask nicely. I love the food at the restaurant here, but I'd much rather eat and drink inside the restaurant than the outside bar potion.   All in all, it was great service, though a little pricey. Still, I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"This has turned out to be our favorite Las Vegas restaurant for when we are in the mood for steak.  We received a basket with 3 types of bread and shared a spinach salad that included red and yellow pear tomatoes and red onions topped with goat cheese.  For an entrée we shared the restaurant's signature pan seared, 22 ounce, bone-in ribeye.  The waiter divided it for us at tableside and it was done medium rare as requested.  The steak was juicy, flavorful and tender.  For sides we shared a large sweet potato that came with maple butter and a rather blah tasting order of sautéed spinach."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!!!!   Aboput 10 of us went there when we were in Vegas for a party.  We all ordered Rib Eye and they over-cooked everyone of them.  Most of us oredred our steaks medium-rare and one guy ordered his rare.  The rare steak came out medium-rare and all of ours came out medium to well-done.    One might be able to overlook the issue if it was one steak but it was 10 steaks.    The sides were good but what a disaster on the steaks.  And to boot, the waiter did not even offer to make any concilations.  Talk about crappy management and service."}
{"text":"Liars and Thieves! Made a reservation for Mother's Day may 9, 2010. I had a $25 off card. Asked if I could use it. Over the phone they said yes.  When I arrived at the restaurant they then said NO. wE CANNOT USE IT ON A HOLIDAY. I did not know Mother's Day is a national holiday. Needless to say, the manager did nothing for us and we walked out angry.  Will NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN. Inside a casino and very smokey,"}
{"text":"In Vegas you have so many options on where to eat. Even if you just want a steak, you're hit with a myriad of choice.  But my suggestion to you is to get off the Strip!  I went to Austin's on a recommendation of a friend, and was just very skeptical. It was all the way up in the boonies in North Las Vegas and in this old hokey Texas Station casino. But don't let that fool you!  This place was a classy place and they made my friend where a shirt with sleeves (he was wearing sleeveless), but that is a whole other story...  Two words: RIB EYE  I am a rib eye man anyhow, so it was no big deal, I love the fat and the flavor, and I usually have it medium-rare. But even my other friends who are usually filet mignon and New York strip guys loved my rib eye, it is their best cut. The filet mignon, if you insist on ordering it, i suggest to just get it rare, TRUST ME. It was not bad either, but again, I am a rib eye man.   The sides we ordered were standard but excellent (creamed spinach, baked potato, asparagus, etc) and the bacon-wrapped shrimp and raw oyster sampler were also excellent.   Service was excellent. Decor was clean and elegant. What a surprise in this hokey casino all the way up in the middle of nowhere! The price was not the cheapest, but with everything plus wine and tip, we spent about $100 each.   I've lived in LA, San Francisco, and NYC, and this was the best rib eye I've had. Another friend grew up in the midwest and he said this was the best rib eye he's had. Only one guy I know who had a steak somewhere in Omaha at a random truck stop said that Austin's rib eye was not the best. I was with some picky eaters that night, and they all loved it. A friend who is a Vegas local also highly recommends. Great meal."}
{"text":"Austin's is tucked away inside of the Texas Station hotel. I had high hopes for the place based on their menu. The decor is cute, but when we arrived the restaurant was practically empty. We were there for two hours and only two other tables were occupied while we dined. When the food started arriving I understood why.  The service was great, but as I said we were one of three tables occupied. Our waiters were very attentive and I was encouraged to sample several different wines before I decided on one for dinner. It was a tough choice because the wine list is not impressive. I decided on a Cab that I could have purchased in Trader Joe's for about $6.99, but probably wouldn't.  Now for the food:  Here is what we ate:  Mushrooms stuffed with filet mignon-these were really ordinary and the filet used was over cooked and not of the best quality...also really underseasoned.  Sliced beefsteak tomato with buffalo mozzarella-nice presentation but completely underseasoned and they used a poor quality balsamic and an even poorer quality cheese.  New York steak-while it was perfectly cooked, it too was underseasoned. The quality of the meat was questionable and judging by the texture, it had been frozen. Really disappointing. It was a sizzler quality steak at $35...ridiculous.  Asparagus with balsamic-ordinary and underseasoned.  We ordered mashed potatoes, but thankfully they never arrived...I suspect they would have been ordinary and underseasoned.  Creme brulee-amazingly ordinary and I think I may have seen one tiny speck from a vanilla bean, but I can't be sure.  Coffee-brown water...the worst coffee I have ever had! I kicked it back and got a latte...that tasted like warm milk.  Basically everything we ordered was underseasoned. It was sort of like hospital food. Maybe they get alot of customers on low sodium, bland food diets. I am not a salt freak, but come on give me some flavor...any flavor. The coffee reminded me of Sanka...brown tasteless water. I know that I wasn't in Starbucks, but seriously it didn't even taste like coffee had ever been in contact with that hot water.  This is an overpriced Sizzler in the low rent district...Go to Craftsteak!!! The prices are about the same and the food is amazing. Even the $6.99 steak dinner at Ellis Island is worlds better than the meal I had at Austin's."}
{"text":"This was maybe the 4th or 5th time I've eaten here and it was great.  I love when a restaurant is consistently good.  The A/C was good but not too cold.  The food that everyone got was cooked to perfection.  I love their chopped salads.  I suggest this restaurant to locals & tourists both.  It is one of my favorite steakhouses in the city."}
{"text":"Well, the Fertitas did it again! They have taken this steak house down the \"let's get cheap and screw the patron\" road once again.... just like they screwed-up the Fiesta steak house... which they eventually closed,  and just about every other restaurant they take control of. Gone are the days at Austin's where you were served a fancy bread selection as an appetizer and you walked away impressed by the over-all experience . Let me say this..... THE CHEFS KNOW HOW TO COOK but they can't take a crap piece of meat and make it tender. And that's what happened the other night when I ordered the prime rib. God, I was so pissed-off when this crap piece of meat with NO FAT came out .... I know steak and this wasn't even a Choice cut. I sent it back after 2 bites... then I asked if the Ferrtitas owned Austin's........ yup, sure enough they did and their \"Screw the customer, we gotta make the most profit\" was very self-evident. The manager offered a different steak so I had the Filet-Mignon...... perfectly cooked. Like I said.. the cooks there did a very nice job but every time we go there,  Austins  has gotten cheaper and cheaper!!!!! What's next?... no water! or I bet the next time they serve margarine with their bread!!!! That's the Fertita way..... go into a restaurant and jew everything down,  and these are  the people that own Station Casinos where Austin's is. I bet they own the Garduno's inside the Fiesta as well.....it has gone to poop! Garduno's used to be awesome! The buffet at Texas station used to be very good but now in the last 6 months has declined quite a bit............ Hey Stations....... keep your coupons for discounts on meals. When you respect your customers once again, call me."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Now I would have never guessed there would be such a beautiful and delish steak house inside this Station Casino, but I was wrong!   Went here for my birthday after hearing that it was good. That is an understatement. We were greeted by the hostess and sat right away with no reservation (it was a week night though). The waiter was great and on top of his game. Drinks and the bread basket came quickly. They have an awesome pretzel bread in there so don't pass it up. My boyfriend and I both ordered 7oz steaks and the Austin Salad and garlic mashed potatoes to split. Food is so tasty and filling.   The rest of the people in the restaurant were dressed from super casual to dressy and it was nice just to relax and enjoy ourselves without being all dressed up.   For dessert we had the cook's choice gelato and sorbet. It was mango and pistachio. I Died! Soo good you can't understand it from just words alone.   I only have two things to point out to future diners: Don't get the ice tea it's from a soda dispenser and is all kinds of gross. And the dessert we got has this confusing wording, which may cause more confusion due to my review, sorry.   It reads: \"Chef's choice gelato and sorbet\". It says AND which in my book means both. Well for the $6 you got to pick one or the other. I said screw it and had to try both flavors. If you are going to make a girl choose please use the words OR."}
{"text":"We've been seeing this prime rib special for $14.99 on the billboards and thought to check it out. The mom and grandma in law wanted to go the Sam's Town buffet for family dinner primarily because they like the prime rib, but the other offerings are rather sad. For the same price- we opted to bring them to a sit down instead.   The special is served daily and comes with a 12oz prime rib, mashed potatoes, and green beans (sides are not negotiable, but you can order a la carte sides if you want something else). The prime that was first put in front of me was told to be medium rare, and that was definitely on the medium scale (which both in laws requested). The busser told me, no it's the sauce on top making it brown and it's medium rare. Whatever, I know my meats and I swiped out my GIL's since hers was definitely more red than mine. Saw her eating hers and yep, not as red as the one I swiped, bit more brown...on the more done of the medium spectrum. The one I took from her was  pink medium, not medium rare so not quite what I requested. It was good with flavorful sauce (not quite a gravy, but heavy to be au jus), but medium rare is kinda a big deal to me to have.  I can't really give them 5 this time since I am kinda a medium rare \"purist\" who scoffs at well cooked steaks and it was not close enough to what I wanted. Sorry, but I just don't accept medium as a \"correct\" way to serve meat and with the attitude telling me that my original piece was medium rare when it was medium done...it wasn't cool. We also got some creamed spinach (sides are $7) and the house chop salad (also $7) to accompany the plate which were both lovely. Service was decent. Haven't really had bad service here before, but the busser shouldn't tell me what I can see.   Sadly, this definitely confirmed my suspicions I shouldn't eat red meat, specially commercially raised. I had major \"itis\" and felt kinda bad....at least I had a last hurrah before I say bye to the mooo.   Overall, I think this beats going to a cheap buffet for prime rib night. It's on the same price range as The Prime Rib Loft and this was definitely better tasting. Is it better than a Lawry's cut? No, but it is good meat for your buck.  I say if you want a good value priced prime rib this one is a solid choice."}
{"text":"I like this place. I love steak and lobster, and these guys always do a great job preparing them. I also love their twice-baked potato (huge and delicious), and there chopped salad is also very good. It's more of a high-end restaurant, so the prices follow in-kind. The service is excellent. I've been there lots of times, so all the servers know my face. The ambiance is dark, but that's the way a high-end steakhouse should be. It's expensive (for me and my wife, it's around $150), but it's worth it (I've been to pricier restaurants which serve much worse quality food). What more can I say... Their tomato and Mozzarella salad (with a balsamic dressing) is great  Almost forgot...Their bread basket has a nice assortment of breads (flatbread, raisin-pumpernickel, and baguette). And their apple tart a la mode is scrumptious. I don't remember ever having a bad meal there."}
{"text":"Was seated promptly, waiter came quickly. Ordered some wine, very good, And Calamari, which was excellent. Ordered their Rib Steak, outstanding.  the baked potato, and Asparagus was good. Prices very sreasonable for such good food.."}
{"text":"Lobster chowder had undercooked potatoes, but was quickly replaced with the house soup.  Signature steak was slightly undercooked for Medium, but considering how thick the steak was, it was excellent!  I also had the twice-baked potato which was tasty.  This wasn't my favorite visit to Austin's, but it won't keep me away."}
{"text":"The Ribeye is the best in Las Vegas! I have tried several restaurants and none compare to Austin's!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their happy hour at the bar. Super strong drinks and amazing food at a reasonable price. Can't beat that and the service was very good. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm rather disappointed in this restaurant....I'd been there about two years ago and really enjoyed it, but this time, the menu seemed different and I think the prices had gone up.  I had a petit filet mignon ($29) and my guest had a tenderloin ($22).  We each had a twice baked potato.  My guest was flabbergasted by the price of the house wine - $11.  Seriously?  It came in a small carafe and definitely wasn't worth $11.  Neither of us had dessert or a salad.or anything else, other than the bread included with the meal.   Even with a $25 off coupon, the total bill came to $53 for basically a  steak and a potato.  The twice baked potatoes are very big, but still......we felt ripped off.  The steaks were more or less tender, but had little flavor.  I was really disappointed because I had told my guest that I was really happy with this place, from my last experience here.  But we both felt unhappy with the prices and the food.  Service was very good, so no complaints there. This is a lovely, low key locals steakhouse with a lot of potential, but charging prices that are out of line with the location and the local clientele is a sure way to lose  business.  I would be willing to try Austins one more time and hopefully I can like it again!"}
{"text":"Austin's is a great local steakhouse. It's ambiance totally sets it apart from the rest of the casino. I've been here several times and the service is always great and the employees are warm and welcoming. The manager almost always visits with every table and checks in on the food and service and will even make drink recommendations.   Now for the food... I must admit, I'm not a huge steak eater so I can't describe to you the subtle differences between medium and medium well  but that's why I dine with my carnivore boyfriend. His favorite cut is a rib eye and he gives extra points when a place has a bone-in cut (which he says has extra flavor). Austin's has both styles and even offers to slice them for you, although he prefers to do that on his own so that all juices stay within. Austin's also offers steak flavorings two different ways - as a sauce or a crust/rub. They have quite a few and I personally like their house sauce which has garlic and balsamic vinegar but the steaks are just as delicious without them. Sides here are just as amazing as the steaks and they offer a variety of after dinner drinks too.   In short, sure there are other places that do great jobs but Austin's does that same great job at half the price!"}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouses in Vegas is tucked away within this small local's casino (Texas Station).  I have tried many Vegas steakhouses and this is one of my favorites.  Austin's had been recommended to me by a number of reputable foodies in the Vegas area and my wife and I gave it a try last time we were in Vegas.  We got the mushrooms stuffed with filet mignon for an appetizer and it was excellent.  For the main course we went with the pan seared ribeye and it was out of this world.  So tender and flavorful.    The meat is cooked in a delicious sauce that really made the dish.  It was a big cut of beef and normally we wouldn't be able to finish portions that large in one sitting, but the meat was so good we ate until it was gone.  For a side dish, we got the spinach and mushrooms and it too was excellent.  The staff were very nice, helpful and knowledgeable.  Some of the best service and food I have encountered."}
{"text":"I was visiting friends in Las Vegas and we decided to go to a steak house for dinner.  A friend suggested this place.  It is in a unlikely casino; not a typical \"Strip\" casino but more of a neighborhood, locals casino.  Everyone there was very friendly and polite.  We were seated right away and were given excellent descriptions on the specials.  I ordered the porterhouse with a baked potato and creamed spinach.  My friends ordered rib eye, New York strip, and prime rib.   Food came out in a reasonable time and it was excellent. The portions are huge and there are lots of flavor on my steak, the creamed spinach was way more than one serving and the baked potato was plump.  We had ordered other sides such as twice baked potatoes and grilled asparagus, which were both good.   This place is a hidden gem of a quality steak house which is in a laid back atmosphere casino.  Make sure you go hungry and keep in mind that the twice baked potato and creamed spinach portions are huge, enough for three orders in some other restaurants. The cost compares to most other steakhouses.  Planning on going back the next time I'm in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Most amazing restaurant ive ever been too. Its dressy but casual is ok. A little expensive $20+ per meat order but its so worth it. Everything from the amazing servers,  the beautiful atmosphere, good bread, amazing meat and LARGE sides and delicious desserts like cheesecake from NY. I could go on and on. Its so worth it for special occasions. It doesnt go with the hotel because everything else there sucks ( see my review for texas station)  I got the king prime rib and my husband got the porterhouse. No sides come with it but theyre only $5 and its enough for 2-4 people per side. We didnt know how big the sides were and ordered 2 sides. Their homemade sauces are AMAZING! I recommend the butter cilantro garlic one. amazing. I cant rant enough. My husband is a journeyman Butcher we are from California and he was extremely impressed with their meat literally melts in your mouth and comes cooked how you order. (Dont order well done..ever) med well or medium is the best. So impressed I would drag myself all the way over to texas station on my next trip JUST for austins. I cant rave enough. Paul and Sean are amazing. Please stop here if you can youll be so impressed and wont forget the experience. Approx $140+ for 2 people ( drinks, top of the menu orders, sides, and dessert) so worth it though. Better than ANY steakhouse ive EVER been to"}
{"text":"There's a manager who's here, who always asks the tables with white guests, how everything is.  I look around at the Black and Latino guests, and he only side-eyes us.  I've dined here enough times to realize that this is not abnormal behavior for him- he makes it very obvious that he does not respect certain demographics of guests."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time a couple of weeks ago, everything was fantastic.  I started with a Caesar salad and my Boyfriend had lobster bisque soup we enjoyed both.  We shared a Porterhouse steak which was perfectly cooked and delicious."}
{"text":"Ended my trip in Vegas with a dinner here. Had a groupon which made it even more amazing.  The service was great, as expected in such an establishment.  It's just sad to go there, and it seems slow.  I  mean the Casino is so far from anything - well, for a tourist that is.  I had the rib eye, and it was an excellent cut of meat. I ordered some other things, they not really worth mentioning.  But my steak, was perfect!"}
{"text":"Incredible steakhouse with excellent prices. I'm used to going to the strip for different steakhouses, this was just as good, but a lot less expensive. I started with a Caesar salad. Had the filet mignon with the baked potato. Finished off with the chocolate layer cake. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Inside texas station. But they will let you in even if dont have a 10 gallon hat on or a pair of spurs! And the armadillo parking out front is a major conveinence. But lets talk steak. Something austins does to perfection. Great meat-always cooked perfect. Service is always spot on. Dont get much casino noise in there and the mints by the bathroom are breathtaking. The bisque leaves a bit to be desired-but thats a minor gripe. Prices are fair and a place i go outta my way to dine at ever so often! Love me some austins!"}
{"text":"We went back with another couple to Austins Steakhouse, and this time while enjoying an excellent juicy Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp as an appetizer, the tail bit me--cut my finger!  So, I'll be more careful next time I wield such a crustacean in my hand.  But at least it was tasty!  Oysters on the Half Shell were very good, but I had to ask for serving spoons.  Both a bowl of French Onion Soup and a Dinner Salad with Bleu Cheese Dressing and Bleu Cheese Crumbles were excellent.  Seafood Chowder was very handsome looking, with chunks of lobster embedded inside.    My 7 oz. Petite Filet was cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, accompanied by Broccoli Rabe, carrots, and cauliflower, and a Baked Potato very efficiently dressed by my server with butter, chives, and bacon.  Peppercorn Sauce was appropriately very peppery, and a veritable ton of crab-centered Oscar topping was supplied for the steak.    I finished with a slice of moist Chocolate Cake and Vanilla Ice Cream.  Another bull's eye scored by Austins' fine kitchen and dining staff!"}
{"text":"My mom moved to Vegas a few years back, so I have had about 8 dinners at Austin's.  Being that she's a local and does not really go to the Strip unless she's taking visitors around, she has found many good restaurants in the local neighborhoods.  Now, this restaurant may not be Ruth Chris or Delmonico's, but it's really damn good.  I can't give it four and a half stars but I wish I could.  My brother, who is the pickiest, snobbiest critic when it comes to steak, was impressed with his dinner.  Frommer's has given this restaurant a great review as well.  I despise the sound of a casino (ding ding ding), and never once has it bothered me once you are seated in the restaurant.  It has NEVER once been smoky-EVER.  Primm Valley Casino IS smoky.  You don't have to be super dressed up, I have seen folks in tshirts and jeans with plastic grocery bags eating dinner at Austin's but its very off putting in the dining environment, PLEASE wear something a little dressy.  Ambience and decor, muted, classy, warm, elegant.  They bring out a very nice bread basket with a selection of unusual breads and butters.  The wine list is fairly decent, the beer list is limited.  After ordering, the food takes a little while to get to you, but after its ready, the waiters rush you a little more than I think they should.   The three of us usually get the petite filet (7 oz), and my husband usually gets the 11 oz filet.  The beef melts in your mouth, and is always cooked to the correct temperature requested.  The Austin's House Salad is one of the things we so look forward to, it's a chopped salad with a buttermilk based dressing, with cucumbers, tomatoes, avocado, bacon, blue cheese---so so so tasty!  The sides we usually like are the mashed potatoes with gorgonzola or garlic and the green beans amandine, the mac and cheese (with truffles).  The broccoli with hollandaise is really just steamed broccoli with sauce on the side, it's just so so.  There is no kids menu, but there are choices for children who are decent eaters:  a small filet, pork chop, the filet sliders on the appetizer menu,  fried or roasted chicken, and there are fries and mashed potatoes.  One year the staff realized my son was not interested in their menu, and ordered him a pizza from inside the casino,and had it delivered to our table.  That's service!  We have always been so full from dinner that we have never had a dessert, so I cannot comment.  We have always left full and satisfied, and have enjoyed every bite.  Highly recommended.  Reservations recommended."}
