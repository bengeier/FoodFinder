{"text":"In a Sea of Asian Restaurants, this place is a delicious jewel in Markham.  The first time we visited, my Husband and I shared a Dinner Plate.  We went again recently and I didn't want to share my Fried Calamari.  It was just too good.  

Great food, great atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Best Greek place in Unionville
It has been a while since my last visit here (about a year). Quality remains good. Servings are generous. Price reasonable. Service is pleasant. I like their Greek salad, gyro and chicken souvlaki. Sides are also yummy. Much better than food court Greek food. However the Greek coffee was not as good as I remembered. I also remembered having free pita served in the past but today it was garlic bread (which was actually a toasted hot dog bun with garlic spread). It wasn't bad, but I prefer pitas. Anyhow, I would keep coming. It was rather quiet today at Saturday lunch hour."}
{"text":"The decoration was pretty nice. Got the chicken souvlaki but it was pretty heavy (the side dish dominates the main by far). The bread given was a-ok but the souvlaki itself was good. The cheese salad was really nice but it is still not the main dish. Should think about presentation or quantity more.

Although a cypress dish I think this place should get some haloumi :) really craving this in terms of greek restaruants."}
{"text":"Service seems better so I am updating my review.  We gave them another try and they were able to bring out the child's order prior to the adult (unlike our last visit where our hungry child had to eat the adult order first because the child's order wasn't ready).

Grilled calamari is a favourite of ours!"}
{"text":"I can finally add another entry to the list of quality food  in Markham. I drive byLoui's Kouzina plenty in my day-to-day  travels, and there's almost always a crowd outside. 

The food is so fresh and tasteful. The staff looked genuinely content just making food and the various other offerings on the menu.

It's very casual and relaxed. If I come for lunch, I always get the same thing because it just works.
They can get really packed on a weeknight and I've never attempted to come on a weekend but I imagine it's even busier then.
Give them your money, it's some damn good food!"}
{"text":"The best Greek food I've had in the GTA! 

I got the chicken souvlaki with roasted potatoes and rice. I find that at other Greek restaurants, the souvlaki has a garlic taste that completely overwhelms the taste of the meat. The chicken here, however, was perfectly marinated and spiced. The side dishes and Greek salad were also very good. My friends had the lamb skewer and they were also very happy with their meals. They also brought us some garlic bread while we waited for our entrees, which was very good.

The portions here are big and you get good value for your dollar. The service is also fast and very courteous. The atmosphere is your average casual Greek restaurant, nothing special. But if you come here, expect to leave very satisfied and full."}
{"text":"Came here on Father's Day thinking it would less busy and also had a hankering for Greek food.

Got here around 1pm and only two large tables were seated for Father's Day lunch. The place is not too big but not small either. 

Got seated right away by the window which was nice. 
First impressions were clean and bright and we'll maintained. 

Liked the way the menu was set up with tabs for different stuff (apps, main, drinks, etc)

For appetizers we ordered the grilled calamari and saganaki. 

Saganaki was very very good. It had very good flavor,  soft and stringy.

Grilled calamari was also very good. Tender and flavourful. Won't be ordered fried anymore! And I like to fry everything!

For mains we ordered the chicken soulvaki and lamb shanks.

The chicken was moist and tender not like most times where it is dry. The lamb shanks were very tender and had a nice flavour to it. You could still taste the lamb without overpowering spices.

The food came quickly and the service was excellent.

This will be my Greek joint in Markham/RH."}
{"text":"I was craving Greek food but did not know where to go.. thankfully I have my handy dandy yelp app!

This place was so yummy and the pricing is decent too! My bf and i shared a small chicken souvlaki plate and fried calamari to start. Everything came out quickly and was delish. Can't wait to come back and try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great Greek food in a surprising location.
Went there on Sunday for a late lunch and was surprised to find good Greek food in Markham.
The Souvlaki dinner and the Moussaka were both flavourful and delicious. The Greek salad was ok, I expected a big chunk of cheese on top (like they serve it in Greece), and the crumbs of cheese that came with the salad didn't feel enough.
Overall great find, will return again if I'm in the area"}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by an actual Greek person, so I had to check it out.  Went for dinner with my wife and we had the flaming saganaki for appetizer, it was good, nice crisp edges.

My wife had the gyro dinner and it was great, very flavourful with some nice steamed veg on the side.  I had the lamb shanks and I'm not sure why they serve it with a steak knife as it was fall of the bone tender.  I picked it apart with mainly my fork.  The flavour was great, as good as the lamb shank I had in Mykonos."}
{"text":"In love with this place! I placed an order over the phone and it was ready for pickup in 15mins! 

We got the chicken solvaki and the gyro plate, a gryo pita and the moussaka! All were superb and came with a greek salad! The potato sides and the rice was to die for. Never disappointed here ! 

I would definitely recommend! You 100% get what you pay and more ontop of it!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekend.  Surprised the place was so empty, but during our meal, there were at least 5 ppl who came in to order take out.  Pork souvlaki was nice and tender with a great char, rice and salad were very standard. 

I would return as the food is pretty decent, and prices are fair."}
{"text":"Had the indian waiter today.  When our food came we noticed there was a hair in one of our dishes.  We told him right away and he just said that he would take it off which he then did with his own hands...  Are you kidding me?!  We had to tell him that we didnt want it!  Did we really have to tell him that?!  Food was just average, never going there again!"}
{"text":"Unfortunate to lose such a great restaurant the old owners were Greek and love the food they sold . Now it just isn't half as good as it used to be . I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Great Greek food.  My favourite is the gyro dinner.  Delicious and huge portions.  Friendly staff and my go to place for Greek."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in all of anywhere! 
Flavor danger!
I usually get the gyro dinner with rice (potato is good too) it comes with salad and garlic bread. The chicken is also good!
Very consistent! It doesn't matter what time you go it always tastes amazing every time. 
Great portion/value especially when it tastes so good!! 
The gyro is cooked to perfection and the meat is top quality throughout the entire piece; no hard or unchewable parts!"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant with a casual atmosphere.  The restaurant is cool in temperature, so dress accordingly.

The service was fast and efficient.  Our server was abrupt and to the point.  Very informal in the way he served.

There is a good variety of food choices on the menu.  I had the small chicken souvlaki dinner.  The serving size is substantial and the prices are very reasonable.  The chicken was moist and the flavor was OK.  Overall good enough.  The others on my table had the gyro dinner and the chicken souvlaki on bun.  Both enjoyed their meals.

A good place for a family meal or to get your Greek fix."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times yet I haven't checked in once or written about it. So here goes. .I consider this one of Markham's best Greek restaurant. There aren't many to choose from in Markham but it's the closest you'll get to the ones on Danforth. 
I agree with other Yelpers that it used to have better food and service with its original owners. 
The food while still good, is not the same as before. The service is where it has faulted. Gone is the chit chat friendly service. The dining room is now serviced by one Asian lady and one Indian guy. They get the job done. That's it."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best greek restaurants out there. I always order the chicken souvlaki dinner whenever I go, and it always tastes delicious. The chicken is tender, the rice is a good texture and the potatoes are full of sauce! They also add some garlic bread for takeout orders which is always a great touch! The portion sizes are also really good! I usually get take out but I did go with a friend for a sit down dinner and the waitress was very nice! The owners are always friendly and quick with the orders as well! I never go to any other greek place but here now!"}
{"text":"This place has really good Greek food. I don't ever eat gyro , but this place has really good food."}
{"text":"Huge portions...can barely finish it. Good service. Comes with complimentary garlic bread"}
{"text":"The food is very good. I love there Chicken on a Pita. They give you 2 chicken sticks in the pita. Salad is traditional Greek with feta and Ice burg lettuce. I eat lunch here at least once per week."}
{"text":"A solid 3 stars!
Loui's is located in a strip mall where 80% of the shops are VERY Asian.  The staff also appear mostly Asian. I was not expecting great Greek food.  
The friendly staff were charming and the lamb souflaki was very good.  They also included garlic bread.
The menu was respectable but not exhaustive.
It was a solid meal.  I left happy.
Oh, they take Visa and MC but not Amex."}
{"text":"One of the best Greek places in town, hands down. 

No idea why this was not on Yelp before, but this hidden gem is a must try for food lovers out there. 

I've tried almost everything on the menu, as i frequent this restaurant, and not a single thing has every disappointed. The dip is homemade, the slovaki is fresh, and everything is made to order. 

The service, first and foremost, is amazing. Very friendly, and very attentive. They are always helpful with suggestions and are never seen with out a smile. 

My recommendations: Start off with the trio dip, comes with some nice toasted pita and three different types of home-made dip. If you want something bigger to start with, go for the quail. Takes a little longer, but so savoury, your tastebuds will wanna die. I always go for the small plate of pork slovaki, with the greek salad and veggies on the side. the Greek salad is one of the BEST greek salads i've ever had. Delicious to the very last bite. If you're still hungry after, grab one of their cakes. Although not made in house, they have a very delicious selection of cakes to choose from. 

One more thing, grab a coffee from them. Amazing coffee. I never go there without getting a cup or two, no matter how late in the night it is. They also have an amazing wine selection as well as some beer from Greece. 

If you want to get satisfied, look no further than Loui's Kouzina!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in the area. All the souvlaki - chicken, pork, lamb - are well done. I've also had the salmon and loved every bite of it! Their dips - particularly, taramosalata - are also excellent."}
{"text":"We get take out here regularly and occasionally eat in. Consistently good greek food, service is always very good. Like it. They really need a website with the menu."}
{"text":"Me and my coworker came here for lunch on a Friday and it was packed. Luckily we got seated soon. I've had my fair share of Souvlaki and I would say although Loui's Kouzina's was better than chain Greek restaurants, I've had better. The meat was succulent but in my opinion could've had a bit more flavour. The potatoes that came alongside the souvlaki also lacked flavour.

We also got the 3 dip pita platter, and it was also mediocre. I've definitely had better hummus and tatsiki elsewhere. The staff were friendly but very busy running around. 

I would say if you are in Markham, Loui's Kouzina is a good option for Greek food, but I wouldn't make the trek here if I was in another part of the GTA."}
{"text":"The Trio was alright. Nothing special, the dips (hummus, tzatziki and I forget the third) tasted like any other dips you could buy at a fast food place. The pita wasn't fresh and slightly stale. Still enjoyed it though and the portion was quite large.

The vegetarian platter was not really appealing at all. The veggies were obviously from frozen. The gyro platter was okay also. 

The salads that came with our dishes were both soggy and the roasted potatoes were overly greasy. Everything else was a little too salty.

I mean it tasted good but mostly because Greek food is awesome. I definitely wouldn't consider this place amazing or anything special, but it was alright.

The restaurant itself isn't fancy or anything and the service was good."}
{"text":"Somewhat hidden restaurant with some amazing Greek food!
The staff are always friendly and helpful, whether my family is the only one dining or whether the restaurant is busy.
You can't go wrong with the souvlaki... very flavourful and fresh. I also enjoyed their calamari-- I've never had calamari that tasted so good! And I used to think I didn't really like Greek salad, until I visited Loui's Kouzina. Now I have a craving for it....
Definitely glad I discovered this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite place for Greek but over the years the quality has slipped, still great portions but quality is not what it used to be.
Pork souvlaki is pretty dry and not juicy and tender like it used to be. 
The saganaki which is fried cheese i really enjoy with the garlic bread they give for free!. I would still come here because its close but if im not dead tired ill drive to Main st Greek sorry Loui Kouzina"}
{"text":"Been here twice before. Ordered the chicken souvlaki, calamari and the gyros plate which comes with pita.  The second time we went we were basically ignored while half the place was empty.  Took them 5 mins to seat us and didn't give us a menu until we have to ask for it.  Did not return to take our order even after I called someone she said she will be back but didn't come back.  Had to call her again before she took our order.  So basically it took us 30 mins to finally to get seat and have our orders taken.  Other than that the food is good and fairly priced."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on Friday. I tried coming with a couple coworkers a few weeks before and we noticed that it gets super packed if you arrive after 12, so this time we made sure we got there before 12 and lucky for us we got a seat right away. The seating area is pretty small so if you're coming alone or with one other, it makes sense to get take out. I got the chicken souvlaki (small plate) with potatoes as my side and it was good. Tho it wasn't anything amazing. The portion is a pretty good size for a small (you get two sticks of souvlaki) and a pretty big Greek salad. They also give you bread to start so I was pretty content at least. But like I said, it's nothing special but good if you wanna satisfy that Greek fix."}
{"text":"The moment I posted my check-in to Loui's on facebook a litany of fb peeps erupted on my wall letting me know how this place used to be good before ownership changed hands. I'd never been before so I have no basis for comparison, that said, I let my own experience shape my opinion and here is what I found.

Greek people are typically insanely proud of their culture and their cuisine so I was a touch surprised to see the entire restaurant was run (front and back of house) by folks of Indian heritage. This is neither a plus nor a minus, but it does call the authenticity into question a tad. 

Our server really wasn't all that helpful with recommendations, and my dining friend had to ask/clarify his order/questions several times (to the point of it being a tad awkward) before he became exasperated and simply made an order.

I had a hankering for a Gyro platter as I was a little tired of chicken and pork, so I ordered the large plate. The meal came with 2 sides (the standard potato/rice) and also a salad. I opted for the Greek Salad. The salad arrived first and was served in a very tiny bowl which was hard to maneuver, and each time I put my fork in either lettuce, tomato or feta would fall on the table.

That said, when I saw the platter of Gyro coming towards me I got very excited as there appeared to be an incredible amount of meat on the plate. That excitement lasted until the dish was placed in front of me and I looked on at the driest (albeit largest) portion of Gyro I've ever seen. 

Basically, what had happened was the gyro that was given to me was all of the over cooked stuff on the outer ridge, it was not cooked on the grill as is customary, just dry meat carved off the spit and placed in impressive fashion on my plate. The one side was cracked and dry and the under side of each piece was as it should be.

Dealing with a Mount Olympus sized plate of dry gyro would require a godly portion of Tzatziki. Alas, this was not to be and I was handed a meager shot of sauce that was served in a plastic container (a la food court Greek food). I asked for extra before I even started to eat and the server informed me it would be $1 extra for another very small Tzatziki. I looked at him funny and his response was - \"I don't make the rules I only work here.\"

It was definitely only enjoyable because of how hungry I was, not because any time or effort was put into this meal. I'd recommend you look elsewhere unless they turn things around.

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I agree with other reviews that suggest this is one of the best options for Greek food in Markham, but that does not mean it's good Greek food. Loui's Kouzina is not comparable to some of the great restaurants on the Danforth. My husband still really enjoys the food at this restaurant but I have disliked it for the past 3 years. The food is average. I wanted to avoid the overcooked souvlaki so I recently ordered the grilled calamari,  it was dissapointing. It was terribly overseasoned with what tasted like packaged, MSG filled, \"all dressed\" red pepper seasoning. My rice was swimming in olive oil and the salad was comparable to a Greek takeout in a mall food court. 

The service was terrible. Our main server was so rude, but the person who gave us our bill at the end was far more pleasant. Before leaving the restaurant, I spoke to the main server and expressed my disappointment with her unfriendly service. She seemed to be either surprised that someone thought she was unfriendly, or surprised that someone actually acknowledged what she already knew."}
{"text":"Really good food, authentic moussaka, beautiful presentation, good portions, great staff."}
{"text":"Went to this location last night with a friend. The place is small and out dated with furniture and decor. You would think it would be more modern since it is in markham. I ordered the chicken souvlaki plate. The potatoes were really good and soft. The salad was very bland and simple. The chicken was okay nothing to brag about. The meal was too over priced based on quality and flavour. This is definitely not the go to place in markham for good Greek food."}
{"text":"STOP ORDERING THE TRIO....unless you have 4+ people. This wonderful assortment of pita slices with hummus, tzatziki and that delightfully delicious pink taramasalata CANNOT be tackled by just 2 people. I KEEP MAKING THAT MISTAKE (with my fiancé). What can I say? I guess we're gluttons for gluten...and punishment.

Aside from stuffing our faces with bread and delicious Middle Eastern spreads, Loui's Kouzina is a great place in Markham to stuff your face on a variety of Greek foods. Kebabs, gyros, pitas, salads, etc. All that meaty goodness that Greek food offers can be found here, with a generous side of potatoes and rice. 

My favourite lunch order is pretty weak, a small salad and an order of taramasalata shared with someone. Maybe a skewer or two. What you don't understand are the portions are HUMONGOUS. That small salad could be a salad entree at another restaurant. Despite my seemingly small order, I always leave with leftovers. My fiance always gets the small kebab plate at $12. He's a big boy and that's a full meal, with not just skewers, but salad and sides. 

And how can this be a great Greek place if the meat isn't good? The skewers are always tender and juicy. The pork is very succulent but the chicken is up there as well. I'm not a fan of lamb, but I did take a bite of the oven roasted lamb shank someone else ordered one time. It was soft to the point of falling off the bone and very lamb-y...perfect for someone who's into that! 

Service is friendly, and I've never had a problem even with a larger crew. Water is always filled, people are always friendly. When you've got value, variety, and flavours like this, you've got a repeat customer in me. Thanks Lou's Kouzina, for making me realize Greek food isn't just \"dry meat on a stick\". 

(50/100) - 2017"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in the northern district!

But, beware if anyone has called for take-out or catering, you will be waiting A LOOOONG wait. 
I waited around 45 minutes for my appetizers to come. My waiter even forgot the bread. They finished cooking the take-out and got to us after the long wait. We had a movie to catch so basically just gobbled like pigs, we were late for our movie as well.

Very clean, service is good, speed not so much. 

Good overall."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch the other day and ordered the pork souvlaki plate to go. I was quoted a 10-minute wait and the food was ready on time. The food was absolutely delicious, and the price-to-quantity ratio was very reasonable. I'll definitely be returning for lunch."}
{"text":"It would have been a 4, but they got my order messed up. Completely messed up. I couldn't even say anything because it was a takeout order.

I ordered the gyro small plate with potatoes. I received the pork souvlaki with fries. Yeah. Thankfully, the souvlaki was still very tender. The fries were meh. It's all good though. Tzatziki covers a multitude of sins. LOL. Portions were very large. I can eat quite a bit, but I basically have enough for another meal. The meal came with a separate container of Greek salad. It was generously topped with feta, tomato slices, and olives. The lettuce was a tad soggy, but I understand. The trip to where we ate was not a short one. Oh. They were quite generous with the pork. I have to say I was impressed. I also really liked whatever they seasoned it with. I want to say rosemary and/or thyme, but I'm not 100% certain.

All in all, for a meal that cost me less than $15, I'm quite satisfied. Next time though, I'd like to get the food I asked for."}
{"text":"Lovely food and portion size! Their rice had a good amount of vinegar so it helped with the heaviness of the food. Lamb shank was stellar when I first went... But portions got smaller last time. I love their potatoes, albeit they're a bit salty. 

I came with my family and my former colleagues. This was a chicken souvlaki dinner. Very filling!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a Greek place for lunch for 3 of us and saw this restaurant had great reviews.  We arrived around 3pm so it was empty in the restaurant.  It started off a little slow but the cooks were on a lunch break when we got there... Which is totally understandable!

Our server was attentive once everyone got there. He just disappeared for a bit once we got our drinks and I had a little bug in my water....gross!  So I had to wait for our food with no drink. 

Once we got the food and I got a bug free drink, everything was amazing! We had the spanakopita and garlic toast to start, which was delicious. The server even did the traditional flame trick at our table. 

I ordered a large chicken souvlaki plate with potatoes, veggies and a Greek salad too. It was so much food but definitely worth it.  The chicken was tender and juicy, with a nice seasoning

The location is a bit out of my way but net time I'm in the area I'd be back"}
{"text":"Loui's Kouzina is right around the corner from me and I've been meaning to try it for years after hearing many good things.

I went in today and was fairly impressed with the place. I was attended to almost immediately after stepping into the restaurant, and brought a glass of water within a minute of sitting down. 

The menu is an appropriate size which made it easy to pick through. I'm not usually ever a fan of lamb, but I figured that if I was going to eat at a Greek restaurant I would have to try a traditionally prepared meal rather than your everyday souvlaki.

I ordered the oven roasted lamb shank and waited no longer than two minutes before a salad topped with feta cheese arrived. Two minutes later garlic bread and five minutes after that the main course. 

I was very impressed with how quickly the food had arrived. The main dish consisted of roasted potatoes, rice and two pieces of lamb shank. 

The potatoes were good although nothing special, and the rice was nice and full. The lamb was well roasted and seasoned just the right amount. The meat was tender and practically fell off the bone. 

What I enjoyed most was the authenticity of the food. I truly felt as if it was Easter and that the chef was my yiayia! It didn't change my mind as I really just do not enjoy eating lamb meat regardless of how or where it is prepared, but it was a good meal either way.

The ambience of the restaurant is a bonus, nice Greek music playing in the background and enjoyable pictures of Greece posted on the walls."}
{"text":"Got a great Greek dinner fix in Markham without having to go downtown :) they also have yummy fish  and chips. Nice and fast service as well!"}
{"text":"They have very good chicken souvlaki,the sides are great and the salad is fresh.
The service is great and the prices are fair.It is the best Greek food in York Region.If you try this place you would be hooked for life."}
{"text":"Food was....alright.

We ordered lunch for the office on a Friday. We called in our order and food was prepared quickly. The portion sizes were massive and matched the higher than average price($15.77), but the quality of food wasn't....amazing. 

I got the small gyro plate with potatoes. The plate contained a lot of meat, but it was a bit dry. This was the complete opposite of the Greek salad which was extremely soggy. I heard a lot of hype over the potatoes, but they didn't measure up to it's name. Sorry to say that the best part of the meal was the hot dog bun garlic bread that came on the side. 

Overall, it wasn't my favourite place for Greek food. Might return one day to give it a second chance, but probably not anytime soon."}
{"text":"In this neck of the woods in Markham, if you're looking for Greek, look no further than Loui's Kouzina!  Small venue but always busy, especially during peak lunch and dinner hours any day of the week.
I'm not sure how long it's been here however I get the sense that there are a lot of loyal patrons new and old coming here.
Their prices are reasonable, the portions are sufficient and the food is delish! No wonder lol 
The layout of the place is nice and most of all it's presentable and clean!
For grub I ordered their pork souvlaki on a bun. It was more than enough to fill my never ending tummy; decadent chunks of lean, tender pork with a perfect portion of tzatziki sauce.
Overall experience was great but I'll have to pay a visit for the ultimate dining experience.

Good job!"}
{"text":"Used to be very good food food comparable to Danforth.  Has seriously gone downhill in the last 3-4 years.  I've stopped coming as the food quality and service has declined.   At least they don't charge extra for the hair in your food."}
{"text":"Decent greek food, the souvlaki was nice and tender. Not particularly fast or attentive service though."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a lunch date and the staff were friendly. We were greeted and seated as soon as possible and they gave us time to review the menu options.

I ordered chicken on a small plate and my boyfriend had the gyro. The meat was all well cooked and seasoned but a bit salty. The Greek salad was very wet :/ I was not a fan of my extremely drenched salad... The sides are not very well seasoned or cooked. Rice is bland and mushy and the potatoes were the same. The fries seemed okay so I'd just stick to those.

The prices are a bit higher but the food doesn't seem to follow up with that pricing. 

It wasn't a bad experience per se but the food makes me quite confident that I will not be returning.."}
{"text":"In the past week, 2 of my close girlfriends have mentioned a 'Greek' place at 16th and Woodbine.  I had no idea there was on there but upon arriving, I already got good vibes.  I've noticed the sign before but never bothered to try it. I should really venture out of my comfort eating zone more often... 

We were greeted immediately after walking in, with smiles and sincerity. Our server (wish I had gotten her name because she was really friendly and helpful), was prompt in taking our drink order.  I inquired about the Greek coffee and she was very knowledgeable in her explanation.  I absolutely loved the coffee :) 

My friend and I ordered a chicken souvlaki plate and gyros plate.  I asked if they could put mine in a wrap instead of getting rice, and maybe get some veggies on the side. I told her i'd pay extra but she was super nice about it and said no problem at all. Then she recited our orders back to us!  It rarely happens anymore, not even in larger corporate restaurants.  (I am a server myself....). 

While waiting for our entrees, we saw our server flame up some cheese..  Two tables had ordered it and we were curious to try, so we ordered it too! It was Saganaki - pan fried kefalotiri cheese. It was delicious! Kind of reminded me of baked Brie.

Our mains arrived shortly after and by this point we were already half stuffed from the Saganaki.  

We managed to do quite some damage still. My gyros pita was flavorful and not too saucy. The gyros meat was tender and not dry - really important.  Portion sizes are generous for the price.  

I am definitely coming back! It is a gem and I'm lucky it's so close to my dwelling!"}
{"text":"Last night we broke one of our cardinal rules.  Never eat in a restaurant with no one else in it.  We did arrive for an early dinner at 5.  This was one of my wife's favorites.  This time she decided to try the lamb plate done medium.  And the salad with the taziki on the side.  Well the salad came with the taziki on it and the server reluctantly replaced it.  The lamb came well done and excessively peppery.  When the waitress asked if we were finished with 2/3 of the lamb still on the plate my wife said yes.  And she did not want to take it home as it was too peppery and well done.  When we arrived we asked for a couple of classes with lemon.  They arrived with no lemon.  When we asked again we were brought to minute slices on a small plate.  My wife got up and went and got some real slices.  Anyway,  long story short,  my wife said if no one says anything we will not be coming back.  We were presented with a full bill and no apologies.  We left and will not be going back"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem. Authentic Greek food, service was nice. Food were authentic, had lamb and chicken souvlaki dinners with my friend. The chicken was really good, the lamb was ok but the texture of the meat was so so, probably due to the quality.  Otherwise dinner was uneventful, service was friendly. Can't complain."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5 stars.

Surprise find, especially in this neighbourhood.  

Lou's is much bigger inside than its exterior suggests.  We ordered a chicken souvlaki and a lamb souvlaki dinner.  Both came with bread, salad and 2 sides of your choice.  Both souvlaki were tender and flavourful.  The funny thing was I right away compared the chicken souvlaki with Zet's chicken souvlaki.  It was just a reflex thinking.  Regret to say Zet's tastes better.  I never have lamb souvlaki at Zet's, so I can't make a comparison.  The salad had too much dressing.  The dressing drown the salad to the point that the flavour was overpowering.  The kitchen could do this fresh vegetable justice by using less dressing.  Kindly note that we got Greek salad without paying an extra $1 for an upgrade.  I wasn't sure if they automatically gave out Greek salad, in that case you should never pay the upgrade fee, or if we were lucky.

Services was friendly, to the point, but nothing more.  It might be because this was a lunch meal.

I really like that Loui's is here to offer an alternative dining option.  I'd love to visit for dinner."}
{"text":"One of the better Greek restaurants in Markham. Great portions, prices and quality of food.  It is a casual restaurant with a good amount of seating and good service. We ordered the gyro Greek sandwich along with chicken souvlaki plate with salad and roasted potatoes. Both meats were juicy and everything was well seasoned."}
{"text":"Quick courteous service, delicious authentic Greek food, decent portions , reasonably priced, good deal for York Region!

Had the small gyros plate with Greek salad and rice, meat was juicy and flavourful, rice was perfectly cooked with a savoury sauce on top and salad had lotsa feta YUMM! Could have used more tsaziki but I say that everywhere !"}
{"text":"Had a tough time finding a good Greek place in Markham, until I stopped in here.
Ordered a small chicken soulvaki plate, which wasn't that small.  Completely satisfying meal."}
{"text":"I've ben here twice so far. No pictures this time because both times I was with friends and decided to focus on our conversation.

The food is pretty good! Perhaps a bit pricey for what you get, but it's still good food that I wouldn't say no to. The fried calamari is crisp on the outside, well seasoned and comes with tzatziki. The Greek fries have a good mix of flavors and there's a lot of feta cheese on top,  though by the end they get a little sour and soggy because of the dressing(?). The garlic butter shrimp is about 10 dollars but they give you around 5 or 6 smallish shrimp. It was good! But way too expensive for the amount of shrimp you get.

I've seen my friends eat the souvlaki and while I've never tried it, the portion looks huge and it does look delicious, as well as the flaming cheese. Meals also come with toasted bread. 

A good place to go with a few friends, but not a huge party. There's not too much space in there. The restaurant is clean with nice, modern decor and service is good. A good place to go if you're in the area and craving Greek food! I would give this a 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"It's nice to find a Greek restaurant here in Markham among all the Asian foods.  We were here to try something different and ended up really enjoying the food here.

I ordered Chicken Fillet $15.95, Greek Coffee $2.25, he ordered Pork Souvlaki (small plate) $11.95.

Soft butter garlic bread was first brought out, then our salads and then entrees.  The food was delicious.  I would have liked the meat a bit softer, but I'm pretty picky.  The dining area was not too busy at the time we went, and service was excellent.  I thought the menu selection would be bigger though, maybe with chicken leg dinner, etc.

Overall and wonderful place for Greek food.  Plenty of parking also."}
{"text":"Got the Gyro and the chicken Slovaki. The meal came with a salad which was probably the highlight of the meal. I think the cheese used in the salad was cottage cheese, I could be wrong though. But the amount of cheese they put in the salad was very generous and made a meat eating like myself really enjoy the salad. The Gyro was really filling with the amount a meat provided and the chicken slovaki was on par with other places like Jimmy the Greek. Left overs can be expected if you order the larger sizes."}
{"text":"This review is for my second time here. Nothing fancy. I feel like it's more of a takeout place than anything, so I do not recommend dining at Loui's. The service is really, really disappointing. The server seems forced to do his job, and is never around to refill water or otherwise. The food is good and filling, but overall, this place was only average."}
{"text":"Post-Good Friday morning, the BF and I were craving Greek food - but we were too lazy to drive all the way down to our usual spot for Greek. So this place was our fallback - since it was close by. 

We each ordered a souvlaki pita and split a small Greek salad. 

The pitas came with the souvlaki hot off the grill and the meat was nice and juicy - juicy enough that it continued to drip on to the plate when as we ate them.

The salad was also quite good. It had a bit too much feta - but that is my own personal preference.

The bill came in at about $ 20 for the two of us including taxes - which was great. 

The place is a local place to eat Greek and that saves me from going to the closest Greek chain in the area. I'll come here the next time I crave Greek food."}
{"text":"I came across Loui's a very long time ago and love this place! The food is delicious and the portions are huge. On the pricey end but you pay for what you get. They're always busy therefore make a reservation or call ahead for take-out. Sometimes they're so busy the service might take a bit longer but in the end, it's worth it. I'll def continue to recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff that care about the food, huge portions for the money. Fantastic value. Fried calamari was amazing, fresh, crispy, not greasy. Large gyros plate is a mountain of super tasty gyro, amazing Greek potatoes and even my steamed veggies were nicely cooked. Would definitely make my way back to this place, and highly recommend you do too."}
{"text":"Nice little Greek restaurant in a plaza dominated by franchises and Chinese food. The food is solid and portions are large. The price point is moderate, not cheap  not expensive but definitely more on the good value side. 

Great for take-out in a busy residential area."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mediterranean cuisine at a decent price. 
 
Great hidden gem and lovely family restaurant."}
{"text":"Pros:
Well prepared dishes
Good value

Cons:
Not too much seating

Loui's has become my go to for Greek cuisine when I'm out.  Great service and food at a good price.  I couldn't ask for more from a place like this.

My go to dish at Greek restaurants is always the lamb souvlaki.  Most Greek restaurants now charge upwards of $20+ for the dish.  I can get one at Loui's for $16.99.  That's amazing if you ask me.  Most dishes here seem to cost anywhere from $2-4 cheaper than you can find elsewhere.  The best part here is you don't sacrifice any taste for the value.    

The lamb souvlaki was very tender and not dry at all.  You get a very good portion for what you pay.  I love the roasted potatoes here.  They are served in a sauce that's just perfect for them.  It makes the potatoes never dry that way.  They also drizzle a bit of that sauce over the rice which makes that extra tasty as well!  Even the salads here are pretty good for a complimentary salad.  My little ones can't stop eating the salad here so as a father that makes me very happy to see that.

My only gripe is that there aren't too many tables at this place.  It's a very popular place among the locals so you can expects wait times during peak times.  Turnover for Greek cuisine isn't the fastest either.  Plan accordingly and you should be fine though.

When I'm uptown and feeling Greek, I'm always going to be coming here for my fix.  I've yet to find a place to offers prices like loui's that isn't a fast food chain."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for years for Greek food. I'm not too sure with the authenticity given the limited Greek options in Markham, but I've never been disappointed eating here.
They've gotten a lot busier, so on Saturday nights, there were times I have to wait around 10-15mins for a table.
Service is standard to below average, but nothing stands out as horrible. Just not as attentive as you might like.
I love their souvlaki, especially the pork. The greek salad is nice, lots and lots of feta! The side potatoes taste odd to me, since they are just boiled with sauce over it so I prefer the pilaf/fries.
I also love their calamari, both grilled and fried."}
{"text":"So surprised to find quality and authentic Greek food in Markham.  The portions are good too!  I've been a returning customer."}
{"text":"the restaurant was excellent. service was good, atmosphere okie. (kinda like a diner, small), packed but no line up.  the raved trio was good but i would not recommend. fresh, tasty, delicious dips with fresh hot toasted pita. i believe the dips were hummus, tzatzki, and fish or flavoured like so.  i find it was not worth the $10.50 sicne the tzatzki came with our dishes anyway and a diff app would have gave our meal more depth/variety.

the greek salad is amazingly fresh.  the overall meal was awesome for greek food, had the gyro and chicken plate. with quality instilled in every bite, it is still the typical greek selection you see at jimmy the greek and mr. greek.  this is a high recommend as a hidden gem uptown and a must try b/c this will sure turn into a regular hit up for greek.

our bill 45$ for two.

went back recently, sept 2012, was not impressed. long wait service, food medicore this time. meh."}
{"text":"I dont know if i like it or not, i got a chicken souvlaki and gyro dinner.

I was a little late on pickup because i was at the doctor in the same plaza and the guy at the counter let me know that which was probably unnecessary, because at least i showed up.

The rice and chicken souvlaki was mehhh, like food court jimmy the greek style. The gyro tasted amazing.

The greek salad was complete garbage, im pretty sure it  went bad 3 days ago, it was not edible and brown asf."}
{"text":"Greek food here is okay. Now I usually order takeout simply because the best food I have tried in this restaurant is chicken souvlaki on a pita.

I have tried their cheesecakes as well, but they aren't  that great, mostly just fattening.

The reason for 3 and not 4 stars is because when I tried souvlaki on a plate here, it just doesn't do it justice like on a pita."}
{"text":"3.5/5

This place is a hidden gem in the plaza at Woodbine and 16th. Even on a weekday at lunch time it was extremely busy inside. There are quite a few tables and mostly all of them were full. I had my order to go so I can't really comment about the service. 

The lady at the cash was very friendly and quickly put my order through. There wasn't anywhere to sit and wait for your order which was kinda awkward. You either stand around the cash and block people trying to order or you block the area near the kitchen where people are bringing plates out/back. Unless there are free tables, this situation should be fixed. 

I ordered a veggie pita and Greek fries. The fries were soggy by the time I got home but they really piled on the feta, so that was a plus. They tasted great anyways. The veggie pita is what I was extremely disappointed in. I've ordered this at several Greek restaurants before and usually you get some grilled vegetables as well as all the toppings. This pita was literally Greek salad inside the wrap. It still tasted okay but if I wanted a Greek salad I would have ordered a Greek salad. It just had iceberg lettuce, cucumber, tomato, onion, feta cheese, and tzatziki sauce (you could also choose hummus if you'd prefer). 

Overall, this is not a bad place. I would probably not come back as I've recently become vegetarian full time and it's a little far from me. If you are not vegetarian then I would recommend coming here. I much prefer Main Street Greek on Main St Markham road for the veggie pita. Delish! 

Also, for people who don't carry cash, like me, they take card! Yay!"}
{"text":"This is a great little Greek style restaurant! Ive tried the pork and chicken souvlaki. The small plates are great because they come with a small Greek salad and your choice of side. I recommend the French fries or the rice. The potatoes tasted ok but they were either really mushy or really hard. I also really liked their tiramosalata (pink dip). The tzatziki tasted very store naught (like the one you get from Costco) and was missing that authentic Greek taste. Overall the serving sizes are good and the flavour of the food is good."}
{"text":"Been there for lunch a few times and it was good. Service was excellent and the place is always packed. So be ready to wait. Only complaint was recently ordered a large takeout and they missed two things. We didn't pay for it but just be sure u double check the order on the phone before hanging up. It ended working out because it was already too muh food."}
{"text":"My boss at C21 was craving for Greek food one night, so we have decided to visit Loui's Kouzina to satisfy his cravings lol. I've never been, but boss seems to love this place a lot and he often orders take out.

It was FREEZING cold this evening, we were welcomed by WARM smiles when we walked in :) The people working there were very friendly. I was especially impressed with our waiter who remembered our orders and special requests like a breeze! He also made sure our cups of hot water is always full. 

Since I 'should be' on a diet after being gluttons over the holidays, I tried to order something small and light for my dinner - a buttery Garlic Shrimps ($10) appetizer for my protein and a refreshing Village Salad ($7.50). But then... there was the complimentary warm garlic bread!! OMG it was so addictive, and I can't stay no to bread lol.

I stole a piece of lamb from my hubby's Lamb Souvlaki dinner ($19.50), and the meat was very succulent and flavourful. And then I started eating off his fries lol. They were hot and crispy, and I can't stay no to fries either. Sigh, so much for dieting T_T

Overall, a satisfying meal with very good portions, great value when you order Souvlaki plates and warm service!"}
{"text":"Loui's Kouzina has a nicely decorated interior. Although the interior is nice, I came in for a gyro sandwich with my husband. The problem was that we paid around $28 for two gyros and a small Greek salad. The gyro was really dry with a generous meat but it was hard to swallow because it was dry. Also the server forgot our hot sauce and the salad had barely any dressing. I'm so surprised that the price is so high when I didn't even get a side with my gyro. In general prices were too high, I don't think I'm gonna come back again."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my family and the food was alright. We ordered 3 dishes, the pork souvlaki on pita and 2 small chicken souvlaki plates. The plates came with one side so we decided to order one side of rice and one side of fries. The portion size is really big and the atmosphere was welcoming. However, the quality of the food was not the greatest. I found that the chicken souvlaki was not tender enough and the fries were just average. To add on, the rice was basically packaged Uncle Ben rice. The pork souvlaki on pita was decent. I was hungry so it got the job done. What made this restaurant 3 stars was that the service was really good. As soon as we walked in the door the servers greeted us and they were always on top of things such as taking our order, asking us if we needed anything, getting us water etc."}
{"text":"My go-to Greek food restaurant in Markham/ Richmond Hill. Always kick things off with the spinach dip - it's a must-try! They give you the option of grilled or fried pita. Large gyro dinner is enough food for two (my boyfriend and I split it all the time ... and he eats a lot). The thing about this place is that it is consistent - food is always as expected. Plenty of variety on the menu, servers are friendly, and food is tasty. If you're in the area, give it a try."}
{"text":"I don't eat Greek food a lot , but I know when I come across good food. 

The service was quick and attentive, very knowledgeable about the extensive menu

Although the lamb I tried was quite tender, and juicy, I found the flavour was quite bland as it wasn't pre-seasoned or marinated, only salted... overly salted. The lamb only came in a large size, so we ordered one to share. The portions were big as they promised, the 2 of us couldn't even finish! 

After reading so many good reviews, I might've came in here in a bad time (Monday 3pm) ..  but I would come back to give it another try. Wouldn't want to miss \"best Greek place in town, hands down\", or \"Best Greek restaurant up in Markham\""}
{"text":"Loui's Kouzina is one of the best Greek restaurant up in Markham... Not that Markham has a lot of other choices for some decent Greek food.

Try not to come on a Saturday night unless you don't mind waiting... At 7 pm, there is a line up for tables!! 

Chicken Souvlaki with 2 sides ($10.95) is satisfying... Chicken is surprisingly juicy and has that right off the grill flavour. Though my food took some time to arrive, I ate the whole loaf of garlic bread while I waited....

Service is good as my waitress checked on me the whole evening and reassure me that my food would be coming soon.....

Now I know Loui's Kouzina would be my Greek restaurant if ever I feel like having some Greek food up in Markham!"}
{"text":"Still stuffed from our lunch at Loui's Kouzina as I write this quick review. Delectable Greek food in Markham, yum...yum...yum...oh absolutely!  

Wonderful food. The pita bread came hot from the oven - oh that was so right with the refreshing dips, The Trio.  Redefined our taste and love for Gyro and Moussaka - truly mouthwatering and flavoursome.  

Roasted Potato siding for my Souvlaki was a treat as it melted in my mouth with a sweet ending.  The rice my husband got for his Souvlaki was a signature.  The meat were a little dry, though.  The Baklava a good finish.

On the downside, the kids meal was dry, i.e. just a skewer of meat on a bed of fries wasn't exactly appetizing.  Had to scoop up some pita dips to make it more delectable.

Its a small place but truly an outstanding casual dining perfect for my family.  Seen a lot of corporate lunch groups who seem to have an equally good time.  Servers were great - approachable and efficient, no need for pen & pencil taking our orders.  Satisfied our tummy and expectations for a better Greek experience.  We're coming back for more!"}
{"text":"As close as you can get to the Danforth without hopping on the 404/DVP and driving for half an hour. 

Really tasty and nicely seasoned souvlaki, very good sides, and excellent prices. I normally stick with the basic chicken souvlaki dinner and I am never disappointed. If I am hungrier, I'll go with the large plate but its a lot of food! 

Great little restaurant in an otherwise asian food-dominat area."}
{"text":"Slowly going down hill. The food here is a solid 3/4 depending on the day/chefs working the kitchen. 

Service is ATROCIOUS. This place still fails to serve me lemon in my water. I ask every time and they just don't give a single *expletive*. The same server mentioned in 
My last review still works here and I always somehow manage to get her. She's horrible. I don't know if it's cause she recognizes me? I'm seriously debating coming back solely because of her bitch attitude. 

Very unfortunate. This place was once amazing .. Management, why are you doing this to us?"}
{"text":"Update:  I tried their homemade burger today and it was delicious! Not frozen, handmade, fresh and juicy.  They had some herbs in it and great value.  

This is a great place with fresh and affordable lunch options.  Beware to get there early as fills up fast during the busy lunch hour.  Staff are very friendly and I really enjoy their Greek salad with chicken kabob.  If you lunch hour is at 12,  be sure to get there at 11;45 so you can get a table as it gets very busy."}
