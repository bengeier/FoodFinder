{"text":"Great food and very welcoming staff. Would definitely recommend and will be returning. The buffet has many flavours and all are great."}
{"text":"I'm not a big buffet fan but Indian buffets are usually better than most, so when I was walking by at lunch and overly hungry, I decided to give this place a shot despite the 2pm posted closing time (it was 1:15pm) and drab exterior. I'm so glad I did! I was wary the buffet would be a slightly chewed up mess of others rejects, but most dishes were full and fresh! The selection and value were surprising -- there were several meat and vegetarian options, and even some fruit and ice cream for dessert! The best part is the service -- some of the friendliest I've experienced in Montréal."}
{"text":"We were in town and walking on Saint-Denis passing by this restaurant. In general we love Indian food and a buffet would provide more options so we checked yelp and Google for its reviews. Gladly the reviews were in general positive so we decided to give it a try. Three things made us change our mind of eating here. 1. The entire restaurant especially the food area was full of cooking fume. It can't be healthy sitting in the smoke for eating; 2. The selection of food was so so; 3. The most important. The owner's attitude wasn't as friendly as a professional in this business could be, although some other reviews specifically said he was very friendly. So we decided to walk away from here and went to another Indian restaurant near by."}
{"text":"Very good food. Authentic pakistani and indian dishes and friendly owners. Biryani, pakoray, chicken tikka, fresh naan."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Very flavourful and authentic. The curries were not very heavy and oily. Their naan was outstanding. I was really happy with it. It wasn't very bready and thick like some Indian restaurants make it sometimes. It was a very well balanced naan. I infact felt they were much better than le Taj. More options than le Taj. Especially for vegetarians.  Atif; the owner was very pleasant and enjoyable to talk to. Wonderful experience. Hidden gem I'd day. Only thing I hope is they accept credit cards in future."}
{"text":"Bad...just bad. I can't even emphasize how bad it really is. The waiter cried. I cried. Everyone cried. This is the end of BUFFET SULTAN."}
{"text":"It's beyond me why this place has so little reviews. Must be new because this place is so good! I normally hate buffets because I lack proper self-control, and I'm not sure how I managed it here as everything was so yummy. You can expect at buffets for half of the dishes to suck, but here everything rocked, even dessert, which customarily blows at buffets.  Not to mention, the service is incredible. Everyone is so nice and welcoming. The craziest part is that when fresh food comes out, they will walk about the dining floor and serve you! Their fresh naan was out of this world.   If you want to be completely satisfied with your meal, come here!"}
