{"text":"I went there yesterday and i will tell you please do not go..........place was pretty empty with maybe just 3 tables occupied but everything takes so long to come.......i'm talking about basic things liked spoons, bowls and water......we needs to ask for these stuffs again and again.........they have liked 3 guys working and bring things which is more than enough for the same number of tables with customers including us.   Food takes forever to comes after the first round........very stingy with sauces/spices.....at one point i asked the guy for more green union and he told me they are sold out of it..........!!!  A chinese resturant running out of Green Union!!!!!!  After a while we asked another guy and he brough it for me after 10 mins........I duno what's wrong with this place............and also the slices of beef that they give  you is liked paper thin and they will not give you more no matter how much u asked them too.........we ordered maybe 3 rounds of beef...only the 1st time they gave us good amount.........then the 2nd time is liked 7 extremely thin pieces and the last round was the worst........they gave us some really not fresh beef which seems to have been frozen for a long long time ....once they hit the water they turned really dark in liked 2 seconds.......we were scared to eat them............it's around 40 dollars which is liked average price for hot pot but the way their service and the amount of food they give is really not worth the money.......no wonder place is so empty........."}
{"text":"I came on a weekday evening in July, and as expected, there were only a few other tables of patrons there.  Despite the more personal attention we received, every order we placed still had a few items being missed.  

The price is on the higher end, with no free soup base nor drinks included in the base price of $25.99/adult on weekdays.  Basic soup bases such as satay start at $3, with individual pots provided to everyone.  

As for the food, they have a few unique items such as beef balls stuffed with cheese, and dumplings that are the width of a quarter (I'm unsure why they were so small).  The portions provided were not generous, as every order of beef that came there was only 1 slice per person.  

I didn't feel I received good value for the premium price paid."}
{"text":"Freezing today so thought hot pot was a good idea - was coming here to Rolling Pot but seems it got renovated and is now Emperor Hot Pot. 

Place is well lit, very clean and looks upscale. Then looking at the menu to find that on weekends it's $27.95/person And you have to pay extra $3-7 for the soup base. That's running over $30/person - supper pricey for hot pot I think, but seems a lot of other reviews agree as well. 

The selection for food is pretty decent, and it should be given the price. But if you want stuff like fresh oysters, rib eye wagyu beef slices, Alaska snow crab legs, or even abalone - you gotta pay a shiny penny for it. 

Typical sauces at hot pot and a limited selection of ice cream flavours. Wouldn't come back though - even though service was fast and our servers were nice."}
{"text":"Good place to hotpot with your friends and family. You have your own individual hotpot bowl at a fair price. Meat, vegetables and fish/beef balls are fresh. Cuttle fish are delicious, with unique spicy marinated beef. Service comes quickly and they're friendly."}
{"text":"This used to be another ayce hot pot place called rolling pot or something... but then renovated and became Emperor. 

Price is very high for ayce hot pot. Not only was it $28 per person for weekend dinner pricing but you also are REQUIRED to add a soup base for additional $3-7, even if you wanted a plain broth. We paid just under $45 after tax and tip which is outrageous for a hot pot place.

The pros of this hotpot place is that it has nice seats and looks very clean. Also there are lots of menu options for your ayce meal. Including the delicious fried bun dipped in condensed milk... I know, not worth your stomach space or value, but hey - its about what is worth it to you!

Also service here was nice. Didnt kick the four of us out after we ate 26 cups of ice cream. They ran out of 2 of the 4 flavours though."}
{"text":"No, no, no and no.

This hot pot location replaced the location for rolling pot, and the decoration made it pretty high end. Coming on a weekday, dinner prices were almost $26 plus tax and tips, talk about expensive for hot pot. Nevertheless, decided to give it a try. 

Most drinks were not included in this AYCE and neither were the pots. We were told that we needed to pay $2.50 for a pot. Definitely not the best type of advertising cause although each person does get their own \"pot\", we didn't know it was extra.

Their quality of food was average in my opinion. The beef slices were decent, and came in three slices at a time... I know they don't want to waste food, but one order equals three pieces of meat IS a little unexpected cause other places don't provide only three slices. 

There was also what I believed to be a minimal selection of seafood for this price. We got the mussels and the shrimp, the mussels were fairly small in my opinion."}
{"text":"So I'm actually going to incorporate service into this review because it's expected. Who else will bring food over?!

I loved that the ventilation was strong. My clothes still smelled but at least it wasn't a sauna when I walked in. Everything was clean, tidy, and spacious. Temperature was probably 20 but we sat at the door so it was a little drafty, but I love the cold.

Lamb was really good! I couldn't differentiate between the meats when they were raw but the taste was definitely there. Food came relatively fast.

I didn't like that all the broth required an additional cost. We were there on NYE and it was a Sunday so it was already +$2. What's even more ridiculous is that chicken broth was +$5.50!! My friend and I got the pork bone broth for +$2.50.

Broth was great. I loved it. There was garlic in it, like actual garlic!

Service was mad slow. They refilled our tea only after 4x of requesting it. One waitress (she was in red, dyed hair ponytail) looked at the empty cup with her pot in her hand, and didn't come back. It was really hard to find a staff member to service us. I was waving my arm like I was a kid in school with a bursting bladder.

Their water was good though. They spritzed lemon in it so it was refreshing.

So... Food was 4/5, price was 3/5, service was 2/5. Loved the ventilation though. The last tenants was rolling pot and I swear I could have died from a heat stroke when it was sti rolling pot."}
{"text":"Always closed. Their hours are not accurate. They dont take their business seriously. Almost every time I been going (recently) they've been closed."}
{"text":"In my most recent eat here, I was left battered, scarred, and completely upset. Why? I do not know exactly. But I was seriously destroyed here (and it is not in a good way my brethrens and sistrens of Yelp.)

Do not get me wrong, I still think this place is relatively good. The soup base is really nice. It isn't too salty and it isn't too bland. Perhaps the ingredients? Perhaps it is the cleanliness of them, the quality that has left me wounded (and by wounded I mean getting completely destroyed in the stomach and other regions *ahem*). But yes. After eating here, I did not feel good immediately. It was like a battle zone in my stomach and it still is (it has subsided a little but I still feel really uneasy and note this is the day after I ate here HELP ME SERIOUSLY my stomach is dead). Also, this has nothing to do with the cleanliness of their stuff, but their god damn portions man. I usually get the \"Combo of Lamb\" or the \"Combo of Delicious\" and their shit just keeps getting smaller with every visit. Like no joke...it's probably because their business isn't going too well, but wow. Sooner or later, I feel like the portions will be non-existent and if that seriously happens then the pricing for these combos are definitely NOT WORTH IT AND IT WOULD JUST BE GOOD TO TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE. 

I want to come again just to check if their portions DO get any smaller (and I really do love their soup base), but at the same time I'm wondering if I want to put myself in such pain again LOOOL BECAUSE LEMME TELL YALL MY STOMACH WAS BUBBLING LIKE CRAZY FOR A REAL LONG TIME AND I WENT TO THE BATHROOM LIKE A TRILLION TIMES THAT DAY OKAY ITS NOT FUN."}
{"text":"To be honest, when we realized Rolling Pot (cheap and quick) was gone, we stood outside looking at reviews because Emperor looked empty and questionable. We tried it out anyways and it was a pleasant surprise! Servers looked a bit intimidating however, they were super nice and quick to bring the food out. Good options and the beef was really good! Most hotpot places have below avg meat or charge you more for good beef. Slightly pricier but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Just OK. This place used to be called Rolling Hot Pot I think but it was redone. While the inside is definitely an upgrade, the price and what you get for that price does not match."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening at around 7pm. Should have taken the emptiness of the restaurant as a hint. 

The servers were inattentive, all stood around chit chatting and on their phones when we needed service. They were clueless as to what broths they had avail and how much extra the sauces cost. We had to ask many times for more tea/water/napkins. Not once did a server come around to refill our broth.

The food was nothing special, typical hot pot dishes, not the greatest quality. For $29.99 (+$2.50 for broth) it was definitely not worth it! 

I recommend going to Kim Tao instead!"}
{"text":"While looking through the menu, I noticed that they offer different broths for different prices ONTOP of the set ayce price. I thought that was really dumb because they should have a couple choices that are included in the price but they didn't. 

The service was pretty slow, it was hard to get any attention. All the food came out but it took awhile. I don't think i'll be coming back."}
{"text":"2.5/5, +.5 for service

Emperor Hotpot replaced what I believe was Rolling Pot, which closed earlier this year. The whole restaurant has been redecorated and it looks like a high end hot pot place, especially with the name given!

There is a decent variety in terms of food available, however in terms of the soup bases most of them require extra cost...which I was pretty disappointed about. I ended up going with a tomato soup base, which I believe was a $3 extra charge (some were up to $5 extra charge!). The pots are individual for each person, which personally I prefer over shared pots.

Most of the food I ate were quite good in quality, such as sliced beef, sliced lamb, octopus, shrimp, oysters, beef tripe, etc. We also ordered wagyu beef, which was an extra charge for each slice you order (minimum of 4 I believe). It tasted okay, but personally I didn't think it was with the high premium charge that I experienced.

Service was quick and efficient, and we had food coming in not even a minute after we ordered since everything is done electronically.

The AYCE prices for this place are a lot higher than other hot pot places like Kim Tao or HiPot (and this doesn't include the premium charges for some soup bases and the wagyu beef), but I personally only found the food quality to be slightly better. Therefore I will have to say that this place isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Ok, yes, the price $28 on weekends and holidays, and I didn't catch that a soup base was required, these are true.  But I guess I will give them four stars based on the quality of the food, and the friendliness of the staff.  The ingredients were excellent.  They will continue to bring them out as long as you want.  Best to take your time to enjoy."}
{"text":"Poor service all around. Decent hot pot but nothing you can't get down the street from other similar establishments. Server could not order and was unwilling even to give us the bill. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This was the closest hotpot place near by. They've been opened for awhile now, so I thought to myself it can't be that bad... my my was I wrong. I walked in on a weekend and the whole restaurant was empty at 8pm. That should've gave me the hint to go somewhere else but I decided to try it out anyway. The staff are always hiding so it's kind of hard to even order food... they're not polite either.

When the food came everything was THINLY sliced. I dumped the slice beef into my broth and it cooked instantly within less than a second... eating here I felt that I was eating nibbles of food every time I took a bite . I'm surprised this restaurant is still up and running... for the price I paid which was 45$ I rather have went to a better restaurant. Not recommended and I'll never come back."}
{"text":"How can you ruin a hotpot experience? Well, this place did. Reservations were made well enough to allow preparation. 
The service was slow, even when we arrived early and   they did not seem to have many people yet. Completely unprepared for for a large group of people. 

It's not only expensive, because you need to pay for the soup separately from what you order. There is no basic soup, every soup is a different charge. 

The food was frozen and after just one order of a vegetable they told us they were out. The servers were busy that we had to ask several times before a simple thing like tea was refilled. 

Hotpot is a simple, fun sharing experience of a meal. But I think dining here just ruined it."}
{"text":"Small quaint resto for hot pot.  Each person has their own personal hot pot so choose your broth and Flavour enhancers.  We went for the all you can eat option.  Beef, angus beef, Lamb, fried fish balls, stuff  fish balls with mushrooms., pork  and varieties of veges.  
Ice cream , tea , rice , noodles  were also included. 
Great for entertains those that love to cook their own food.  $28 per person plus tax n tip."}
