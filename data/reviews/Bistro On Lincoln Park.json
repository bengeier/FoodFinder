{"text":"Good service and pleasant atmosphere ... Completely ruined by bland, unevenly prepared food. The menu had a decent (if not limited) amount of choices but i found myself thinking it lacked depth and variation. I really want to be able to recommend all local independant restaurants! However i would have to say 'steer clear' here."}
{"text":"I have not eaten there since the chef change this past fall.  Great experience for a party of five that I was with.   Everyone enjoyed their dinners - a variety of entrees.     Very much enjoyed the atmosphere and the service."}
{"text":"I will keep this simple: the food was slightly above average, service was terribly slow, and the dining room was cold and drafty. Considering there are many other options in the same price range in Tremont, Lincoln Park Bistro is OK, but you could do better."}
{"text":"This is one of the best kept secrets in Tremont's hip Lincoln Park district. 

I came in with some friends and enjoyed the best pear martini I have ever had and a delicious dish of melt-in-your-mouth short ribs. 

The staff were friendly and completed the cozy ambiance of this wonderful local hang out. Be sure to make a reservation at the window tables to get the best view of the park!"}
{"text":"Went here with 3 other people. I really like the decor of the restaurant. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. My husband and I got the seared ahi tuna. I thought it was very good. The only problem I had with it was the amount of tuna with the meal. The portion of food was perfect, but I feel there should've been a bit more tuna for $26. Or instead of adding more tuna I'd reduce the price a bit. The tuna came with French beans, roasted garlic - potato puree, balsamic marinara and a parmesan crisp. The 2 other people got the strip steak and the chicken pot pie. They both thought their food was delicious. 

We also got dessert. They have homemade ice cream. Our table had vanilla and salted caramel and they all thought it was good. I had the Ohio Apple Pie. The pie was okay but I didn't think it was anything special.

I would probably come back to try out the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure why this place doesn't have higher ratings. Perhaps it's misleading to think 'bistro' because it's more of a classy restaurant and bar than anything else. The food has hints of the artsy taste of the really expensive stuff (think Michelin star restaurants in SF) but at less than half the price. 

Perhaps it's that the entrance can be confusing to find, or that one particular waiter has a bit of a snobbish air, or that entrees run in the $20 and up range. 

But the ambiance, decor, and the food make up for that. How should I describe the food? It is always playful, and the flavors sophisticated. The meat is some of the best I've had in Cleveland: cooked perfectly, flavorful and juicy but not overdone. Although the portions don't look that big, the richness of the food fills you up quickly. Things change around on the menu so I can't say if the specific dishes I've tried on past occasions are still offered--but the short ribs have always been great. On a recent Valentine's Day there was a special menu with a delicious crab-stuffed bass dish. 


Overall, the food here is always creative and in my opinion, worth the price. Some restaurants charge more for food just because of the ingredients (seafood, organic beef, etc) but this place has taste. No it doesn't compare to an $80 meal of pure artistic genius, but then you don't have to spend that much to experience what is still quality chef skill.

They offer Groupons from time to time so I would definitely recommend checking it out with a discount. I have not tried the wine list, the bar, or the happy hour menu, so I can only vouch for the food--which I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I don't know, I don't know! I usually reserve two-star ratings for those places verging on the side of \"bad.\" But, going by the yelp phraseology, \"Meh. I've experienced better\" is about right.

Returned to BOLP (hehe, that sounds funny) for brunch. I was very excited, as I heard about some great pancake options. Went there with my husband, baby, and two sis-in-laws. We got seated pretty quickly; however, we were soon trumped by a very large party who the staff were suddenly running around for (they had old people as well as several children, so perhaps they thought that party had shorter fuses than we did. Not so, as our entire table was suffering from hanger [hunger anger]). The service was scattered, as if they had just opened. I waited ten minutes for juice.

I got the corned beef hash, which had to have been the most dry, bland hash I have ever had. It almost felt semi-healthy, which is a bad thing if you're talking about hash. I might as well have gotten the steel-cut oats! Also, they forgot to bring my toast.

Everyone else got pancakes, and they WERE tasty (yep, I stuck my fork into every last variety). I tried apple walnut, banana granola (also known as \"chunky monkeys\" on the menu), and sourdough, which I liked, but really tasted like French toast, which was a tad strange. They were also gigantic and nobody could finish them.

The upside was that it was fairly empty on a Sunday at brunch time, and that it's ok to bring kids (this is certainly NOT a place for children during the swanky evening hours). The downside was that it was, again, boring, too expensive for what you get, and the service, from the hostess to the servers, was lifeless. When comparing this place to brunch at Grumpy's, which I've also given negative comments to, I would actually rather go to Grumpy's because at least the coffee is good, it's cheap, and it has a community feel instead of an off-putting, \"cool\" vibe."}
{"text":"I must be spoiled. The food was great. The location is nice. The dining room is lovely. But nothing about Bistro on Lincoln Park knocked my socks off. 

They have a french inspired menu (not traditionally my favorite, but I do love butter). I think that I am just growing into a true Clevelander and have begun to appreciate \"pub grub done right\" more than \"cuisine.\""}
{"text":"I like being pleasantly surprised.

When I came across a Groupon for here, I thought it might be a nice opportunity to check out a new place. Of course, I procrastinated till it almost expired, then snatched the husband for a date night. The Groupon suggested calling ahead for a reservation. We called as we were leaving the house and got a 7pm reservation fine. However, we were dining pretty early for a Saturday night. The Bistro is smaller and I imagine it fills up as evening progresses. 

The Bistro on Lincoln Park is right on Lincoln Park and thus has a charming little view. When we arrived early for a our reservation, we were given the option of sitting in the bar or in the dining area. We chose the bar to get access to the dinner and bar menu. The less expensive bar menu offers smaller plates like burgers, soup, and sides with prices around $8. The dinner menu is more what you would expect from a Bistro with prices ranging from $18 - $26. The beer and wine list was decent with enough options for choosy me. The husband ordered a GL Dortmunder and I had a glass of Carmenere. It appears that their menu changes seasonally and with what is freshly available. The online menu is just a sample so you can get an idea of the food not exact.  I was happy to see a few vegetarian options. 

Our food was quiet good. We started with a nice cheese plate. It had 4 cheeses, a few pieces of bread, nuts, apple, and crackers. A $12 price tag would have been more fitting than a $15. The husband ordered the chicken pot pie which was a good portion of savory potatoes, peas, and chicken, but we felt it was a little overpriced at $18. I ordered the seared ahi tuna which I enjoyed very much. Tuna is usually paired with asian flavors so I appreciated the more Italian flavors of the balsamic marinara, french beans, and potato puree. I wish I would have saved room for dessert. The Ohio Apple pie sounded delightful

The atmosphere was nice. I loved the the tile in the bar. The decor was modern without  looking like Chipotle. I liked the vibe. It was not as pretentious as other places in Tremont. It was welcoming and had a good energy. The noise level was quiet enough that we could have a good conversation but not so quiet that everyone else could hear us too. Since I'm deaf from too many rock shows, I notice the little things :) Staff was attentive and courteous. Our meals took a little longer but the waiter made sure we knew we weren't forgotten about. With the appetizer, we didn't mind the slower pacing of the meal. 

The Bistro on Lincoln Park was great for an impromptu date and I would like to come back for their happy hour and brunch, or another dinner to just order from the bar menu. Cheers."}
{"text":"The staff here was super snotty and the food was pretty bland.  My fiance, a friend and I checked out this little place after the ale fest at lincoln park.  First of all, the service was...odd.  We didn't see anyone in the restaurant (on either side) and asked a woman who was moving chairs outside if they were open. Perfectly legitimate question, I think.  She said snottily that of course they were open.  Um, ok?  Another woman popped her head out and led us inside at which point she just left us at the bar.  The bartender who was making white russians (since the place was empty we had no idea who these drinks were for) was also a bit snotty.  Everyone made us feel as if we were imposing in some way.  I GUESS a customer who is willing to pay you for food and drinks could rub you the wrong way.  Anyway...

I agree with other posters here...the bread is seriously boring.  It needs SOMETHING...ANYTHING!  the breadsticks just are not enough to make that breadbasket come alive. i had a roll and decided to wait out my entree.  Between the three of us we ordered the hanger steak, chicken in mourning and truffle pasta.  The chicken was definitely in mourning.  Depressed, I'd say.  The  heaping mass of french fries which practically smothered the too rare hanger steak seemed like a rush job and the pasta was downright awful. None of the ingredients seemed to go together and the morels really overpowered the dish.

I'd say eat here if you're desperate but not if you want good food and a good atmosphere.  Like others have said, there's really just not enough going on here to make it stellar in any way."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit. The waitress was very nice and attentive. The food was good, not amazing but solid. My mother enjoyed her short ribs more than I enjoyed my scallop casserole. No complaints, just not phenomenal for the price point. The wine was delicious. The homemade caramel salt ice cream is really good too!

All in all, a good experience. I enjoyed the ambiance, waitress and food but I think it could be a bit better prepared."}
{"text":"Eh...two stars seemed harsh so I'm being nice.  Plus after the huge lines at the Chow Down, I guess waiting inside is better than waiting outside in the cold.  We walk in and are immediately seated.  Without menus.  We think that the hostess is going to bring them.  She doesn't.  We eventually have to ask a waitress for them.  
My friend orders a coffee and then asks for another minute to look over the menu.  That minute turned into fifteen minutes.  Fifteen minutes for a cup of coffee.  A table that arrived after us received their bloody mary and martini in a shorter amount of time.  Plus they got to order, something we really wanted to do.  
I don't know, it just seemed like everyone was moving in slow motion.  It wasn't to busy.  There were empty tables but the server and hostess just seemed a step behind.  
Oh well, we eventually got our food and it was good, not amazing, but good.  I take that back, the crab eggs benedict was delicious.  Instead of an english muffin, there was a crab cake.  An amazing crab cake with real crab.  I ordered the lamb burger and it was decent.  The meat just tasted like generic gyro meat, but I like that.  So it was all good.  The fries were good as was the aioli.  
The space is really cute and I do hope the place succeeds but it'll probably be a while before I come back."}
{"text":"I give BOLP a 3 stars, the atmosphere is nice and warm.  The service is professional but the food is just OK, put it that way, we have better around town.  First thing to compliant is they have to update their menu in the web site.  I am looking forward to their Beet Salad, Lobster Pot Pie and Shell fish with Squid Ink Linguini.  My wife and I already figure out what to order ahead of time.  They have none of the above.  Our waitress is very nice and checks with the chef regarding to the Squid Ink Linguini.  The chef said they have some leave but no shell fish but scallop only.  My friend ordered that and it just tastes OK.  Both soups are very well done: Cream of mushroom and tomato bisque.  My wife hasthe Meat load which is excellent.  My friend has the chicken pot pie (instead of Lobster pot pie) which is OK.  I order the special scallop casserole, they just use the cream of mushroom sauces top of pasta and seared the scallop on top.  

I agreed with Micheal on the previous review, may be their food just lacked of depth and variation.  I have tasted better food around town."}
{"text":"Pretty good brunch. We had the pancakes and an order of biscuits and gravy. Both were good and the service was prompt and courteous. 

Biscuits and sausage gravy were even good warmed up days later to my surprise."}
{"text":"We were in the neighb late one Friday, and someone suggested we try this place. Pricier than intended, but decided to give it a go, and so happy we did. Ends up they have happy hour every weeknight til closing (perhaps starts at 9:30 on fri and sat, not sure), which is my dream come true. We were able to sample a bunch of apps for $5 each, and drink specials. The food was excellent, each dish was carefully flavored and executed, and willl definitely go back for a full meal. Ingredients also fresh and much of it local, from house made mozzarella to tasty forest mushrooms. I'm a sucker for great cheese and fancy mushrooms, which shows they care. Decor a little generic, but no biggie."}
{"text":"My extended family got together here for a pre-Christmas brunch this past weekend. We were in the front area by the bar, I was surprised how small it was considering the place looks like fairly large in the front. I didn't get a chance to see the other dining areas, but I wish I did.

Their brunch menu leans heavily towards breakfast. I think there were only two things that didn't involve breakfast or eggs. I am not a huge breakfast fan, so I had the lamb burger. 

It took a while for all of us to get our food. Granted, there were about 18 of us, but I was really hungry. When the food came, people scarfed it down. From what I saw, the pancakes were enormous. No one could finish them. The dishes with poached eggs seemed very light on food and were finished easily in under 10 minutes. My lamb burger was pretty good. The structural integrity of the burger didn't last, so I got halfway through and finished it with a fork and knife.

For someone who hates eggs and isn't a huge breakfast fan, this brunch pretty much left me with two options. I think it would be great if they sort of expanded the whole brunch theme and included more non-breakfast items. The coffee here, though, is really great. I could easily drink it black.

I want to come back here and do a regular sit-down dinner or happy hour, as it seems like everyone loves the happy hour."}
{"text":"We decided to check out Happy Hour at Bistro the other night and, I mean, honestly, how hard is it to be good during happy hour?  Serve decent drinks and pretty good food and don't come to one million dollars and you're alright in my book.

Yes, my standards for happy hour are obviously low. Given that, Bistro on Lincoln Park STILL only gets 3 stars.  The drinks were terrible.  I make bad mixed drinks (hell, that's why I agree to pay $10+ for them when I go out!) and if I think I could do a better job behind the bar, that's just sad.  They weren't even worth the discounted $5 price tag.  The mac and cheese was the best thing I had.  Nothing was terrible just not noteworthy.  

I thought it was a good thing that happy hour lasted until close, but apparently not.  Because we were totally alone.  Like just us.  And the server.  No music.  It was like we could have heard that *chirp chirp* noise that people make when they are uncomfortable and it's really quiet.  If you don't draw a huge crowd, at least put some interesting music on! 

I really like the idea of this place - it's just poorly executed.  Even at half price!"}
{"text":"(Caveat: I've only ever ordered off the Happy Hour menu, so I can't really testify to their main menu offerings. But with such great deals and delicious dishes on the Happy Hour menu, why order anything else?)

I just moved over to the west side, and in comparison to the east side, I'm not sure what's a bigger advantage of this side of town--the wide variety of outstanding restaurants or the lack of traffic congestion! Places like this make answering this question even harder, because it's darn good.

I've been here three separate times--once with my wife (Sheila F.) to celebrate our anniversary before we saw Phantom of the Opera, once with my buddies, and once with my wife and my MIL who visited from out of town. Honestly, the quality of my experiences keeps getting better and better, which is always a great sign for the future.

I've seen some complaints about the service here; maybe it was just an off night, because I have always had exceptional customer service here (and I'm so demanding that I have complained to McDonald's customer service folks). Case in point: we were pressed for time before Phantom, so we rushed our server along. Unfortunately, our order got slightly messed up--we received one dish we didn't order, and one dish that we did order didn't make it to the table. In response to that, the server made sure that the last dish was made and was packed up to take home, let us keep the extra dish free of charge, AND didn't charge us for the one that we didn't get to eat there! Some folks might stick their noses up and say, \"They should have gotten it right the first time,\" but I'll take my 5 dishes for the price of 3 dishes and write a wonderful review on Yelp with a full tummy.

I've had a plethora of delicacies from the Happy Hour menu, which changes every so often. So far, I've had the Italian Sausage and Polenta, Duck Shepherd's Pie, Bruschetta, Italian Beef Stew and Polenta, the Lamb Sliders, the grilled cheese-esque item, the Croque Monsieur, and the Truffle Mac and Cheese. I'd get them all again in a heartbeat, and if you put a gun to my head and made me pick the worst one, it'd be the Duck Shepherd's Pie.

The draft beers change frequently, and the Happy Hour drinks are great too. I'm not a big martini guy, but my wife and MIL ordered a killer Apple Martini last night that was very, very good. 

I know some of the reviews on here are a bit spotty, but I would encourage you to check this place out. I would never in good conscience encourage anyone to eat anywhere with bad food, and I hope that all who go there in the future have pleasant dining experiences. This place is definitely an asset to the Tremont neighborhood, and I'm definitely going to have my fingers crossed that they don't either close or change up their Happy Hour policies (it runs all evening long Tuesday-Thursday and at various points on Friday) because then I might not be able to go there as much as I would like!"}
