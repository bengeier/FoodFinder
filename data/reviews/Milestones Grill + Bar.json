{"text":"Great times and good eats for a Sunday brunch! Our waiter was awesome (Lexus?). This was our second visit to the same location. Definitely a better experience the 2nd time. Really nice atmosphere for a Sunday. Loved the Chocolate Banana Cream Pudding!"}
{"text":"Went to eat here before a movie. The sommersby sangria was the best I have ever had!! 16oz for $25 pitcher! We nibbled on some calamari, yam frites and chicken bites. They were all tasty and reasonably priced. Our server was amazing, checking on is when needed. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow. Received my glass of water after 15 minutes. Server was not friendly at all.  Food was disappointing. Their signature dish thai basil noodles tasted atrocious. Tuna tacos had no taste very bland.  Had to add salt and pepper. The smoked salmon chacuterie was also a failure. The bread was soggy in the middle and there was oil everywhere which made my hands very oily. Luckily I don't have to pay for this meal as I received a gift card from my manager for Christmas. Never coming back.  Ever. Not my cup of tea. 

P.s. This was my first review on yelp. I had to download the application to write this because I was super disappointed. I had checked their menu online and was very excited :("}
{"text":"my boyfriend and I came here on Monday for his birthday and we had a very nice time.  I enjoyed the Caesar salad as well as the garlic bread although I wasn't much for the fritters .  my boyfriend ordered the jerk chicken dish with quinoa and lime yogurt sauce that tasted very good and I ordered a pasta that was less than thrilling, very very plain.  We had a very nice time but just weren't overly impressed. I will for sure give them another chance and just wont order a pasta again."}
{"text":"The service here is good and the food is pretty good too.  I just wish they had more enticing options for apps. Ahi tuna tacos are delicious but a bit pricey."}
{"text":"This was my very first milestones experience. It was my girlfriend's birthday and the suggestion came from her dad which was unusual given that her parents rarely make the trip to eat at a restaurant that isn't Asian/Chinese (mainly because they never know where to start when it comes to ordering off the massive menus that places like Milestones have). However, Milestone's had an ongoing promotion for birthdays where the birthday girl/boy gets their entree for free if 4 or more entrees are ordered in total (including the birthday girl/boy entree). And you can use this offer either a week before/after your birthday.

We were quickly seated after which, our server came by and introduced us to the specials for the night (I love it when I don't have to ask for this kind of stuff), and then gave us time to look at the menu while checking back on us frequently. We started off with the Spinach and Artichoke dip as this is my go-to appetizer at any standard dine-in restaurant chain like Milestones. To my disappointment, it was served with tortilla chips instead of pita/naan bread which I am accustomed to from other places like Kelsey's (so far the best spinach/artichoke dip I've had). The dip itself was mediocre but a little too liquid/not cheesy enough for my taste (2.5 stars). I like the thicker dips where I can feel my arteries clogging as I munch them down!

For the entree, all 4 of us had some variation of their steak entrees. 2 of us had the NY strip and 2 of us had the standard sirloin. I had the top sirloin with crab and shrimp which came to about $30 after tax. The steak itself was very ordinary but what made the dish tasty was the shrimp+crab in lobster butter which I used to mix with the mashed potatoes (3.5 stars). My gf had the same dish except she upgraded to a striploin.

The problem was that my gf and her dad's steaks were completely over-cooked. After waiting for 40 mins for the steaks (her parents were not impressed), we had to send the steaks back. However, the manager of the store (I think her name was Donna or Debrah. It started with a D, I always mix up names like this which makes me think I have dyslexia but with hearing instead of reading if such a thing exists) could not have handled it any better. One server took the steaks back to be refired and immediately apologized without questioning us (As an avid steak eater, nothing angers me more than when a someone questions my ability to judge what \"med-rare\" should taste like). About 1 minute later, the store manager came by to apologize and explained that the mishap was due to the fact the had a trainee on the grill tonight because their head chef was away. She was extremely friendly and immediately offered to comp the steaks that were overcooked and since my gf's was free anyway, we only ended up paying for 1 steak total! When the new steaks were served, the manager served them herself with additional sides of of the shrimp/crab in lobster butter.

At the end of the day, although the food itself wasn't the best thing ever, the service (5 stars) and friendly staff turned a bad situation into an enjoyable night!

P.S. the birthday girl/boy also gets a free ice cream/brownie sundae dessert with one of those sparking/crackling sticks (not sure what they're called)."}
{"text":"Their food is ok... I ordered a burger it was huge couldn't finish it but It wasn't the best burger. I couldn't finish the fries either.
Also ordered a steak the other time i came here, That was good but a bit pricey for what it was. Could go somewhere cheaper and better. 

The service is excellent though! the last time i came i had a very nice waiter! 
The environment felt very warm and cozy, but seating was a bit tight.

Probably won't come back though, unless i have to haha!"}
{"text":"Sucks to hear people had bad experiences. This is my 4th visit to this location and it hasn't changed much. My fiancé and I were greeted politely at the door and asked if we wanted be seated at the bar or dining area. She said if we chose the dining area, it would be approximately 20 mins wait. We only waited for 10 minutes and we got our table!

I wasn't expecting greatness here, so I didn't have high hopes of good service and super quality food. Lo and behold, their service was spectacular. All the staff were extremely friendly and very polite - that definitely deserves 2 stars! This also fits my moto: the food is only as good as the service. If service under par, then that just makes the food that much less tasteful!

To start off, the lady ordered a Somersby White sangria. I'm not the fruity type of drink kind of guy, but this was pretty darn good!

The food took a while to come (least 20 minutes wait). The fiancé ordered the seafood cajun pasta and I had the 10oz striploin steak. The pasta was dazzled with cajun spice and tasted wonderful. It had decent sized shrimps, mussels, salmon and thin cuts of chicken. Flavour was good, though it was a little too oily at the bottom. It could've been the salmon or spice oils.. I told her it was the salmon oil, so she won't feel bad eating it lol 

I wanted something good to treat myself after a long day of work. It came very hot, which I love! It had fries, zucchini and peppers on the side. I asked for medium rare, but I thought it came as medium. I didn't ask them to make me another one as we were in a rush to go to another venue. The first bite of the steak was good, very juicy, tender and fresh. As I cut closer to the middle, the meat got tougher and not what I was expecting. Two strikes for my meal alone.. The saving Grace came in the form of the fries.. It was so hot, fresh and crunchy.. My goodness, I think I can go back just for the fries!

I mentioned the service being superb and that's no lie. I didn't, however, mention it was slow. I had to ask for the bill twice, paid but had to wait for them to collect the money. Then waited for her to come back with my change.. Just getting the bill alone was almost 10 minutes.

The meal came out to be $64ish, which I thought was a little over priced for what we ordered.. Especially all my complaints about the steak. I think I would've had a better experience at The Keg, granted I paid $10 more (which I won't mind!). There won't be a next time..


Unless it's Wednesday $50 date night! :D"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of chains, but Milestones usually delivers.

I come here for breakfast since they have some unique selections, like the eggs Benny with shrimp.

Today I'm here for lunch.  I avoid the Asian themed dishes since they are never that great and with all the restaurants in Markham with authentic, why waste it here.  So I ordered the carbonara.  I enjoyed the dish, but it was very heavy.  I do expect that somewhat from this dish, but serving it along with focaccia bread is just too much carbs.  

I would say my many visits to Milestones have been reasonably good, about 90% of the time.  Far above other chains.  There is even a great experience once in a while, usually when I order the prime rib."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is really good. For regular menu meals I don't have a whole lot to say but I love their weekend brunch menu. 
I almost always get the Eggs Milestones, which is a vegetarian version of the Eggs Benedict, but on the odd occasion I do order their French toast. It's got enough sweet syrup to make you smile, but they add just that bit of cinnamon and lime rind, enough to give the dish that nice kick and added finesse! They also use baguettes instead of regular plain bread. Just marvelous!!"}
{"text":"Ambience very good but food choices for vegetarians are very few."}
{"text":"Was here for the seafood event. $5 Bellini 
I only wanted appetizer so I ordered the crispy salt & vinegar popcorn shrimp. It was served with actual popcorn... not what I expected"}
{"text":"Went here on a late night trip, around 11. Dinner menu was done. Server said we are only serving drinks and apps till close. 
Few good options. I got few long island iced teas,  and the calamari. Friend got Stella beer in bottle, along with chicken Bits. He said the chicken Bits were good. Calamari was okay. I've had better before. Even tho the restaurant was empty. Service was really slow. Didn't even get the menus till our second round of drinks. 

Nice place. Could be a cute dinner date. But since it's in a plaza with the other options around, I'd prolly go else where unless this was the only place open."}
{"text":"This place is the antithesis of why I don't like corporate hell hole franchises. Why do I punish myself though? I really need to talk my friend about that. Anyhoo, here is what was wrong

1. What do ya mean you don't have Parmesan cheese for my pasta?
2. Why do I gotta wait half hour to get a bill?
3. What'd do you mean I gotta go to the bar to get change you are supposed to have?

Anyone want a $50 gift certificate to this place?

That's right, I ain't going back. Or learn from the empress walk location."}
{"text":"I am the first to review which means a badge for me! lol

Went here for lunch with some co workers today and i was impressed with the service.  The waiter was on point with everything, got our food to us fast and checked up on us for refills, etc.

I ordered the butternut squash ravioli and my co workers ordered the Thai chicken roll up and American burger.  Both said it was really good, even the burger was mentioned as \"the best burger he has had in awhile\".  My ravioli was really good as well.

all in all we will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I went to Milestones for Post-Valentine's Day dinner as my boyfriend wasn't available until Sunday. 

We were told we'd have to wait 45 minutes. I said we'll wait in the bar and when we go there, the ladies dining in the mini seating area were just leaving and we were able to score a seat. Also, it was Play-Off weekend so I let my boyfriend indulge in the big screen tv because he really didn't want to miss the game.

Our waiter was very friendly and funny. I ordered the steak that came with roasted potato's and seasonal veggies. It was scrumdiddlyumcious! Steak was cooked to perfection (Medium-Well). 

Milestone's never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Milestones has always been my favourite chain restaurant.

Though, tonight's experience is another story. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the ambience, the attentive and friendly service, but it was really the FOOD. 

Ordered the prime rib and the lamb medallion, both on medium rare.
The prime rib was tough and chewy to eat. I found it difficult to chew through it and really had 2 options: to swallow the piece whole or to spit it out. I picked the latter. 

The lamb medallion was two small pieces of overdone (and even burnt on one of the pieces) meat. The entire dish was quite sad, as the bok choy and potato made up 80% of the dish. 

I may come back, but not anytime too soon."}
{"text":"Just on business trip to Milestones ON on Highway # 7 East in Markham on business trip and enjoy the food and service.  I had the Mushroom Chicken dish and my business associate has the salmon. The chicken was the best I had in a while on the road. Service was on the spot and the prices were good."}
{"text":"This is not the first time I've been to Milestones, but particularly, this was my 2nd visit to this location.

Having both worked late, my gf and I decided to come here and try their Date Night specials on Wednesdays. The acquisition of a $50 gift card from work also swayed our decisions.

We were both indecisive so we both ended up getting the 8oz steak sirloin from their selection menu for Date Night. We shared a huge caesar salad as a starter, and along with our mains, finished it with a warm large chocolate fudge cookie topped with vanilla ice cream as a dessert.

It was a crowded restaurant; mostly office workers, must be the year end Christmas dinner/party. Especially since it was only a Wednesday night.

She ordered rare and I ordered my usual medium rare.  Being steak enthusiasts, we found it very dry and dull/bland to taste on the outside. It only became slightly moist near the centre, and that was it.  The side of vegies, green beans sprouts and carrots were dried like wood. We didn't touch it at all after one bite. Mashed potatoes were flavorless, tasted prefrozen and thawed then reheated.

I don't recall Milestones being this bad before. Did their quality gone down the drain? I recall having had a fantastic prime rib in years past before.  Was it because this is from the Date Night menu?

The salad was great though, but how do you screw up salad, really now...

To top it off, we both ended up with indigestion and a bad experience with the porcelain throne at home 2 to 3 hours after dinner.  Was there something in the salad, steak or cookie? Must be the steak perhaps...ugh.

I would most likely not come here again."}
{"text":"came for dinner with an appetizer coupon. food is just ok. everything taste way too greasy. White Chocolate cheese cake is way too sweet even to someone like me with sweet teeth. Similar restaurants, Moxie's serves way better food I'd say."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to milestones.  Usually, I stay away from these chain restaurants because I like trying out new and distinct restaurants.  However, my former teacher suggested this place, and I didn't want to object.

I was actually quite pleased with the quality of the food and the service here!  We were quickly seated (due to reservations).  My former teacher had her child (2 years) with us, and they brought a booster seat and a some crayons for her to draw with.

Looking through the menu - I was quite impresed by what Milestones had to offer.  My friend ordered the seafood salad, I ordered myself the cajun shrimp diane.  I believe my former teacher ordered the special (steak with lobster sauce) and her husband ordered a sandwich that is usually only offered during lunch, but they made an exception.  (If I was able to open the milestones website, I would be more specific on what they had ordered).

My cajun shrimp was delicious.  Sauce was impeccabe with the jasmine rice.  However, they included some bok choy in it, which really threw me off. I'm use to having my bok choy with Asian food.  However, kudos to them for trying.

Service was great.  Our waiter came around to talk to us every once in a while and did not complain about the little two year old running around.

All in all, a great experience.  Great place uptown if you're looking for a western meal."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here last Thursday night for their 25th anniversary celebration specials. They have stepped up their game since I'd been to a Milestones at least a few years ago. From the hot spinach dip to the chicken with goat cheese and chick peas, burgers with a fresh soft brioche bun, chocolate tart, bread pudding, their signature Bellinis EVERYTHING was delicious. Our server Liberty was a peach and the restaurant's decor was pleasant and clean. They have ample free parking in the communal mall parking lot. The only thing I didn't like was sitting next to the busy and brightly lit kitchen where servers were talking. I wish I knew more about the contents of the food (local? organic? canned? powdered?) to be able to comment on it but they have definitely improved their quality and the promotional prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"You get a free meal if it's your birthday within 1 week, before or after!!!

Not sure what all the details are, but it's on their website.  We went with a party of 7, and all the birthday girl did was print out the offer from the websit and showed it to the waitress.

Our waitress was really good...almost too cheery.  She reminded us of Belle, yes...that's princesll Belle from Beauty and the Beast.  She always smiled and had really big dimples.  It really showed how a waitress could make a normal outing into a very enjoyable one.

The food was good, came all at once.  The Burgers are excellent there.  They don't look like they are freshly made, but they were big and delicious.  The Sweet Potatoe fries are a must try.

Pricing is decent, not as expensive as Oliver and Bonnicini's, but more than a Pickle Barrel.

This place is a good middle/upper tier place to go to....good enough for dates, clients, and groups...without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"It is really 3.5 stars.  I have added 0.5 star for the considerate services.

As a major chain, Milestones tries very hard to be predictable yet classier than other chains.  This location has a nice ambiance, nice table setting, polite and well groomed waitresses.  Despite my general bias against major chains, I have to admit that the food tastes decent if only mass-produced.  

We ordered a Winter Roots Vegetable Starter Salad ($11) and a Valencia Paella ($25) from the Seasonal Inspiration Menu.  I wasn't hungry, so the starter salad was the perfect size for me.  It tasted fresh and delicious.  The squash in it was surprisingly filling.  I was happy with the salad.  The paella had a nice colour and texture.  The portion, however, was small.  It was smaller than the starter salad (see pictures).  At this point, a waitress asked us what we thought of the meal, we replied that the portion of the panella was too small for a man, though we insisted that we didn't want anything extra to make it up.  When my BF finished the paella, he felt \"not hungry\".  This was disappointing after spending $25 on essentially a seafood rice dish.

The waitress came to our rescue.  Without any hint, she came to our table with a smaller paella, approximately one-third the size of the regular order. She said she hated to see us leaving hungry.  My BF was grateful, as I watched him devouring the extra food.  He felt \"satisfied\" after.

So this explains the extra 0.5 star.  When there is a potentially dissatisfied customer, the servicing staff takes initiative to remedy the experience at a reasonable cost to the restaurant.  Our waitress didn't want a customer to never return.  We may not order a panella again, but we will return for other entrees."}
{"text":"I enjoyed everything from beginning to end. After being rejected by Inspire Restaurant because they are too fully booked we opted for a chain restaurant like Milestones. I really wasn't expecting much but I was surprisingly pleased with everything. 

Started off with a bellini $5 - basically an alcoholic slushi which tasted really nice since it was such a hot day. 

Baked goat cheese and roasted garlic appetizer $12.50 - it was basically a do it yourself type meal where you place toppings yourself on the flatbread that is provided. There was a sweet fig sauce and a cranberry jam which you spread on the flatbread. Then theres the goat cheese and garlic with arugula leaves. I really wasn't impressed at first because they gave so little goat cheese but I found when you taste all the toppings in one bite it was amazing. Once again this reminded me of the movie Ratatouille where the rat combined cheese and a mushroom to create a whole different flavour. The dish grew on me quickly and I loved it. 

Asian sticky ribs appetizer $12.50 - they were more like slippery ribs. I couldn't get a good grip on it with my fingers. There was some sweetness to the rib and they were fall off the bone tender. Tasted amazing.

Butternut squash ravioli $18.50 - comes topped with baby tomatoes, spinach, caramelized pecans and goat cheese. The pecans really stood out for me. They had a nice sweetness and made the dish that much better. The ravioli itself were huge and filled with butternut squash like the name suggests. Once again, when you place all the toppings in one bite it just made the dish taste so much better. 

Decadant duo dessert $11 - comes with two cakes. One was a white chocolate cheese cake. Super creamy and silky smooth. Just don't know who they do it. The 2nd cake was a chocolate type cake. Once again it was silky smooth and creamy - the texture reminded me a little of the Godiva cheese cake you can get at the cheese cake factory. Both cakes tasted amazing but if I had to choose the white chocolate cheese cake wins. 

I was so full by the end of the meal and just barely finished the dessert. Service was top notch and super friendly."}
{"text":"I do like this chain but recent times I went whether it be mon, wed, or sat evenings, service has been really slow. Their ability to get their steaks cooked to a proper medium is also inconsistent. Last month my steak was absolutely tender and delicious. This month my steak was tough and disappointing. Their salads and pastas are pretty good too. I recommend the creamy chicken penne. And drinks, Ive always been a fan of their mojitos. My family decided we are going to look into a new place for our monthly steak cravings. If you go, check online for their specials. Wednesdays is date night at Milestones. It's $50 between two people and includes one appetizers, two entrees and one dessert. This deal works for multiples of two so if you have a party of four,  you can still take advantage of this deal."}
{"text":"Ive had a few good brunch experiences and a handful of poor dinner dates at this location. It was Father's Day weekend and my father in law picked this neighbourhood restaurant-we made a reservation for 11 on a Friday night. We ordered the artichoke dip (it's the right thing to do when you visit Milestones!), mozzarella balls, and bruschetta. The apps were amazing... Then the service and mains just went downhill from there.
The restaurant was not even at full capacity and our meals took over 30 minutes to be served. The manager came to apologize, but our server did not even come by once during the wait. I would not consider her rude, but definitely inattentive and unprofessional. We had to ask multiple times for water, and it was like she avoided eye contact. She would even start walking away before her sentence was finished. 
A few of my family members did not enjoy their steak; they found the peppercorn sauce really salty. My grilled salmon was cold by the time I took the first bite, but I was so hungry finished most of my food. 
This is my second bad dinner experience at is location this year, I definitely will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Looks good from outside but far from good

We stopped by this restaurant during lunch time and looked at the menu and it looked great.  We decided - we will come back for dinner.  We should have gone elsewhere.

Our party of 7 was promptly seated and then we waited for service to start.  

-  The food lacked taste.  I had to put a lot of salt on the food and it still didn't taste good.
-  The beer was cold and boy did they try to get that right - they did not. 

-  Upon paying I asked to do two transactions because I was paying for one of my friends who did not have their credit card and wanted to keep it separate from mine - the waitress said it was okay but when I went to swipe the card the second time - no go.  

-  We waited for refills several times.  At one time the waitress came by and left the water on the table opposite us.  

Honestly, this place looked great from the outside but it was not that good at all.  McDonalds was better."}
{"text":"Savour York Region 2013 at Milestones is one sweet deal.

$25 dinner menu allow me to order 
- Roasted Mushroom Soup
- 8oz Certified Angus Beef Top Sirloin
- Cookies and Cream (Warm White Chocolate Cookies with Vanilla Gelato)

Mushroom Soup has a little kick of spice which was delicious. Steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and tender. And of course I enjoyed my dessert which is always the best part!

I will be back for more...

Their Date Night menu does have similar $50 for 2 people, but what if I don't have a date............."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick dinner and this place reminds me of your typical bar and grill style food back in the US. We sat at the bar/lounge area because it was faster with no wait.  There were a few choices for appetizers and salads with majority of the dishes being chicken or pasta. I decided to try the markham m beer with Kobe beef sliders. The sliders were pretty delicious, great flavor and came with a nice dipping sauce. They were however really small, but I think I'm used to American portion sizes. The beer was light with a strange aftertaste but it was nice to try Canadian beer. 

The service was pretty good. Quick, polite and helpful. Not sure if I would come again simply because the food was pretty ordinary and kinda expensive."}
{"text":"I had the angus steak medium rare, roasted potatoes, and vegetables.  It was ok.  The place is dimly lit. It can get noisy."}
{"text":"This is based on Easter Sunday brunch.  Great experience!

Outside: tonnes of free parking.   I like how the building looks.  Modern but not off putting. Someplace you want to go. There's a patio that looks like its awesome in the summer!!.  Door is in the front.

Decor : nice, comfortable, feels like you are in a nice restaurant.  . there is a dining room, section with tables and booths, and a bar section with tables. 

Service: ok, it wasn't that nusu, but there was only one waiter. A hostess, a deliverer/table cleaner, and a manager.  Every one was wonderful and so nice!!!  Right away we asked to change from a booth to a table and they couldn't have been nicer.  

Our waiter was named Alex, honestly this guy was so nice and did a great job.  I feel I only want to go when he's working!

Food: I got the prime rib hash. It was delicious. Try it, big chunks of potatoes, chunks of beef, corn, peppers.  A tomatoes ish sauce coating it all. And a wedge of garlic bread.  Get this. Seriously. Worth it!! 

 My friend got the breakfast with fruit side. The fruit was old, probably cut a day or two before, they were starting to ferment. Don't get the fruit 

We shared an order of crispy cauliflower. It was delish but honestly wasn't worth the money. There only a few florets for 5 bucks. Get it if someone else is paying. 

Cost: I signed up to their mail list and used a coupon then sent lastonth for 10 bucks off 30, so with tax and everything, all that food and coffees came up to 31. Not bad for the quantity and quality of food.

Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Good service... good food... 
Was Friday evening, so waiter was moving a little bit fast (asked us a couple times if we were ready to order).  More people moved through a restaurant, means more money.  But he was polite, funny, and had recommendations for us.  
Food was pretty good, price was reasonable.  Was not \"wow'd\" in any sense....but would come back (just wouldn't run back).  
I did notice that the physical set up of the restaurant was a little odd.  Was pretty backed in there in rows of booths... with a long hallway between.  I understand when you read it, it sounds pretty normal.  Just when I looked out over the restaurant, I thought... \"Wow... they got a lot of booths in here\".  Which is great, because I like sitting in a booth.  
Anyways..food was as expected, service was as expected.  No issues."}
