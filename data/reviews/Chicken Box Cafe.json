{"text":"Oh Chicken Box, how I miss thee...... I haven't lived in Charlotte in over 5 years but yet and still I still crave this place and refer others there. It is good quality food so that is why I keep coming back for the same ole same ole. My favorite is their 3 piece wing dinner. I like there collard greens and their hushpuppies. I also like there sweet tea, although I think its their crushed ice I like. I also love that the food is made to order and always hot. So kudos to Chicken Box, and if you haven't tried it go!!!!"}
{"text":"This is no longer The Chicken Box Cafe.  Old owners or new owners, it wasn't very good. The fried chicken wasn't crispy or seasoned like before. They were out of Mac and Cheese!!! Where I used to come in and place my order and go, this time others got their food before me and I had to ask where my order was.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Having just finished a Know Your Farms tour and watching cute little chickens cluck all around in open areas, of course I had to make a bee line for the Chicken Box Cafe!  The fried chicken here is 6 stars.  It really is incredible.  Moist, tender, just the right amount of salt.  The side dishes are only 3 stars.  So when you average 6 and 3, you get 3 and that's why I gave it 4 stars.  If you like fried chicken, I'd recommend getting a box of it to go.  And if you visit right now, they're also selling Barack Obama cookies.  Yep.  I picked up a box for my brother-in-law, who might be one of these voters who is \"undecided\".  I guess the candidates are so similar that it's hard to tell them apart.  Uh... anyway, the President wants you to check out Chicken Box Cafe, so be patriotic and DO IT!"}
{"text":"I usually order takeout from here. The Sugar Creek location. The fried chicken is the best I have had in Charlotte. I also had the Mac and cheese and the broccoli casserole was equally flavorful. I have been at least 3 times and each time the food is great."}
{"text":"Greasy overpriced food. Mac and cheese boring, bland, no flavor . Yams were   from the can. Chicken livers were  fried hard in old smelly grease, that stank up my whole car.  . Cake dry boring I dont believe it was home made.  . Umimpressed and disappointed,  I won't eat here again.  Its  definitely not like momma makes it."}
{"text":"This must be our fourth or fifth time we have had The Chicken Box cater an affair and they never disappoint.  This time we ordered 60 pieces of fried chicken. All pieces were done perfectly, crispy and seasoned well. Our guests were impressed with the fried chicken.  Just a side note-this past summer, we had Chicken Box cater our family reunion banquet. This was a great meal, with great sides. They raved over the mac and cheese and green beans.  So far, we have been very happy with their catering as well as the occasional meal while out and about. Would most definitely recommend The Chicken Box."}
{"text":"I agree w/  a previous yelper who says this place is not really a bargain. It's definitely a solid 4 stars on the food itself, but you typically can't get out of the place for less than $10-12 at lunch. I've had fried chicken (on par with Price's), fried croaker (bony as hell, but delicious), gizzards (best thing on the menu...why do I love the texture of those things) and country fried steak. The extensive side choices (mac n cheese, broccoli casserole, pintos, collards, stuffing, etc) are phenomenal and one could make a meal on sides alone. The staff is pretty accomodating, but I'm guessing everything is cooked to order, so it's not a great place to go if you're in a hurry. Other than that - I wish that you could do 1/2 stars on here - because they are closer to a 4 than a 3."}
{"text":"My mother, daughter and I went here last week. Very disappointed the fish was old, mac and cheese disgusting, the yams out of can, Cole slaw very wet. Waited 15 minutes for rice and gravy and got a refund. young guys working in the kitchen don't know how to cook or season canned foods. we use to love this place not anymore will not be back."}
{"text":"Closest to mom and granma's cookin from back in MY day i've had in the city since i've been in Charlotte, all was well , now I had two meals delivered by wewillgetit.com , so I did not experience the inside of business but even if they hang from the rafters at least the food is OUTSTANDING!  NEXT!"}
{"text":"I have yet to have a great experience from this Chicken Box on Sugar creek. (I grew up eating the one on North Tryon with the same owners).  My mother gave me the warning not to eat the one on Sugar creek but to continue going to the North Tryon location. Once the locations were combined to the Sugar Creek location, I decided it couldn't be THAT bad anymore. I was wrong. I ordered my usual, Bbq chicken white meat, broccoli casserole , Mac and cheese, and I add a side of rice and gravy. I called it in and sent my boyfriend to pick it up. Once he got home he assured me the employee checked the bag for all the contents. When we finally open every thing we were missing 2 sides (My Favorite two sides! ). Once I finally cooled down, I began eating the chicken and it was awful, looked like they just slapped Bbq onto baked chicken (It used to look like it had been stewing for hours, The meat would fall off the bone) . It's safe to say I will never be back. To think I was in love with this place and spoke so highly of it!"}
{"text":"Wait 30 after calling in my order 30 prior to showing up. They fried the chicken and okra in burnt grease. On top of that my kids got food poisoning from this dump. OSHA needs to shut this cess pool down."}
{"text":"Have you ever heard the term, \"so good make you wanna slap ur momma?\" This has been our post church brunch spot for a few months now. It's usually so packed we don't get a chance to eat inside, at least thats what I tell my wife so I can catch the football game lol. I recommend you eat here at least once in your life because one taste will have you ordering twice"}
{"text":"The food was good, really good even. 3.5-4 stars for the food.  But the kitchen was awful. The food took forever to arrive, they brought out the wrong plates multiple times, and they completely forgot a side of fries our party ordered. When we brought it up, they said they would be right out. But they still weren't out by the time we finished the rest of our meal. The waitress actually told us it was because they were holding fries back for a large takeout order. On the one hand, I applaud her honesty I guess, but how about serving all your customers equally? We ended up getting it taken off the ticket.  So, if you're willing to put up with a terrible dining experience, you can get a good meal at a good price.  Maybe the moral of the story here is get it to go, apparently they'll prioritize you, lol."}
{"text":"Ok, my girlfriend and I drove all the way from hickory just to eat here and I will say that the chicken box did not disappoint us. I had the 4 wing dinner with collards and okra and she had the oxtails with rice,  collards and okra. We enjoyed our meals and left full and satisfied.  I will say that the chicken wings, in my opinion was average but the oxtails was the highlight of the dinner. Overall I rate this place 4 stars for service, sides and those delicious oxtails."}
{"text":"I have visited twice in two months. On my first visit my friend and I ordered Smothered Pork Chops,  Fried Chicken, Gizzards, Mac & Cheese and Cabbage. Smothered Porks were good, Mac & Cheese bad and everything else was just ok. Second visit Smothered Pork Chops, Mac & Cheese & Broccoli Casserole. This time EVERYTHING was bad. Gravy was dark, pork chops VERY dry, Mac & Cheese was even dry. Seemed like it had possibly been sitting for a while. Service is nothing to rave about. Needless to say I will not try this place again or recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food. Great price. It looks a bit sketch but it is worth the food. The workers seemed friendly.  There was a guy selling DVDs at the door which was a bit nerve racking however the food was great."}
{"text":"Eh it was ok. Nothing really to brag about. All they have is coleslaw and tater tots,they do not have any type of vegetables which was the reason I went.although I did get the three Wing, I'm sorry the four wing dinner. It was okay nothing special.  I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Chicken ALWAYS done right! Fish! Outstanding! The green beans and cabbage are fabulous just like the cornbread! I've had them cater two events and the food is perfect every time! I love the food at The Chicken Box! Oh and when you cater an event the smoked BBQ chicken is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Having a taste for some soul food and reading the previous reviews, the family went there for dinner last night. I had high hopes for the quality but I was disappointed. The sign said, \"for when you miss ya mama's cooking\" but I have to confess, my mother did not prepare macaroni and cheese with velveeta, nor did she make candied yams from canned sweet potatoes. . And that struck me right away. The cornbread was good, although a bit dried, giving me the impression that they were from a day earlier or so. The tilapia was well seasoned and so were the chicken wings, although both were a bit heavy-headed on the salt. I felt like this place was \"the place to go\" back in the day, but the home cooked soul food has clearly corners cut and that impacted that slow cooked taste that soul food usually renders."}
{"text":"Price's beats this by a mile.  I wanted to love this place - I wanted to not have to huddle in my car after carrying Price's magical white box down the street like I stole it. I wanted to sit down and eat, dammit!   But it won't be here.  The place is a dive that offers a TON of stuff. We ordered the 2 white piece chicken meals with 2 sides and my son got the 10pc wingettes. We chose Mac n cheese, mashed with gravy, fried okra, sweet potato casserole and hush puppies. The Mac was very,good, okra the same. Sweet potatoes were in chunk form - nice treat - and had a syrup instead of the usual streusel. The hush puppies were classic too-heavy-for-their-size balls of wonderfulness but nothing new. The mashed potatoes were ice cold. Think about that. Why weren't they fresh? Why wouldn't they be screaming hot considering they were drowned in a very peppery gravy (a tad too peppery and I love the stuff). The chicken was salty, crunchy and overcooked. The wings were little things, fried like the bigger things, no sauce. Peppery. My kid likes spicy so I'm hoping they didn't dumb it down for him, which happens a lot. All of these things can be laid at the feet of a bad cook just wanting to watch the game on a Sunday afternoon (4-ish). Maybe it's banging any other day, any other time except for THIS day when it was dry and salty and meh. I don't want that. I want chicken still sizzling with grease popping off crunchy skin that makes your eyes roll. I want a fresh biscuit or roll, cole slaw, tots - all packaged already. I'll even huddle in the car awkwardly trying to nom nom without making a complete mess. I want Price's."}
{"text":"First-timer and I ordered fried chicken to go.  My plan was to head home, take the meal out of the container, lay it all out on a nice plate and leisurely make my way through the chicken, mac and cheese and cabbage.  You know - like a normal person.  But NOOOO!  Sigh.  I got in the car and started driving when the smell of the chicken completely overwhelmed me.  I could not help myself. One hand on the wheel, the other digging around in the box pulling off random pieces of chicken to eat.  So good!  Seriously, I couldn't stop myself.  I'd like to say I didn't rip open the cellophane covering the plastic fork at the red light just so I could taste the sides, but I'd be telling an untruth.  Yep, I did that too.  Next time I'll try to pace myself.  Thanks Chicken Box for making sure you added a couple of napkins to the bag. I needed them.  Really, really good chicken!"}
{"text":"I looooovvvvvvee this place.  When you step into the door you might as well loosen your belt a notch or two, it's time to get your grub on.  Here's my list of the GREATS at Chick Box: 1) Fried Chicken; 2)Fried Tillapia; 3)Fried Whiting; 4) Collard Greens; 4)Mac N Cheese.  Wash it all down with a cold lemonade. AAAHhhhhhh!!  Don't forget desert, coconut cake or Sweet Potatoes (Yams).  If you miss mama's home cooking you must try this place."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! The fried chicken is excellent!!! I love their potato salad and macaroni and cheese. Ive never been disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time eating here and they never disappoints. It's definitely not the nicest looking restaurant on the outside but the food makes up for that. This time I got the 2pc fried chicken dinner with macaroni and cheese and candied yams. The fried chicken is always crispy and tender. Some of the BEST fried chicken in town. The macaroni and cheese was very flavorful as well. However, I was not very impressed with the candied yams. Next time, I will stick with the fries which are well seasoned. The Sweet Tea was BOMB and just how I like it (I prefer my tea very sweet).   The service is pretty good. Every time I order, it takes no more than 10 mins for my order to finish.   I would definitely recommend this place. I can ensure that you won't be disappointed. Thank me later."}
{"text":"I must say, on my most recent trip to the Chicken Box (second location), I was quite disappointed. I don't know if they were having a bad day, or if it was just me. I was in the mood for fish so I ordered the whiting dinner. It's usually pretty good. On this particular day, the fish was really thin and a little on the tough side. Can white fish be tough? lol I had fried okra ( my fav!) for my side and the taste was just way off! I'm going to blame it on bad greese. Any other time I never have a bad meal at either locations. Not the best soul food in town, but pretty good."}
{"text":"I drove by this place so many times not thinking much about it, until a friend from out of town wanted to try some southern fried chicken. I am so glad that I stopped by this place on a whim. They make the chicken to order, so expect to wait for about 15 minutes if you don't call ahead. The chicken is so crispy and the meat is incredibly moist. I love this chicken more than Prices' because it's less greasy. They have a drive-thru window that is for pick-up only, so your best bet is to call ahead and just drive up. I love love love this chicken!"}
{"text":"I visited this establishment at the recommendation from a friend as I was visiting the area and in search of soul food. This place did not disappoint! Everything was fresh and delicious! Will definitely be returning next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Easy access from I85. I stopped in because of a friend's recommendation. The free sweet tea at Yelp check-in was a good deal too.  Best part of the meal were the extra crispy chicken wings. The collards were a bit salty, but delicious.  The mac and cheese was too sweet for my taste,  but it was baked fresh.   I walked in today and there were over a dozen watermelons on the floor. It kind of added to the low frills ambiance.    The staff was nice and the food service was very quick."}
{"text":"Best soul food..... Ever. Great ppl too. Gizzards and everything else on the menu is amazing."}
{"text":"This place hits the spot on a Sunday afternoon!   Like the previous reviews have mentioned if you're looking for hot, fresh well seasoned soul food...this is your place!   I ordered the three wing dinner with pinto beans and rice and cabbage. The chicken came out pipping hot and was very well seasoned! I was hoping the wings would be a bit larger but overall they tasted delicious! Both the rice and beans and cabbage were delicious!   I'm looking forward to trying several more sides including the  mac and cheese, broccoli and cheese casserole and collard greens. And of course I want more of that fried chicken!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine who lives in Charlotte took me here and I definitely enjoyed the experience. Great fried chicken and the sides were excellent as well. The greens were great."}
{"text":"They have expanded! I didn't even know.  This location is so much bigger than the last one. Pleasant, fast service.  All the food was hot and home cooked. I was pleasantly surprised. Its a little limited but its cheap and you get a ton of food."}
{"text":"1st time there. Ordered 3 wing dinner with black eyes peas cabbage & slaw. They gave me 4 wings because the wings were tiny. The peas & slaw were good. I did not like the cabbage. Cashier was nice & friendly. I went at lunch time. Taste like home cooking. Has a large menu. Good if u do not want to cook yourself. Has true soul food. Maybe next time l try the smothered pork chops or neckbones & rice."}
{"text":"I'm going to need the Chicken Box to step it up a notch.  My last couple of visits were just ok, but they've always been inconsistent so I guess I could be blamed for continuing to go back."}
{"text":"I guess a restaurant is doing pretty good if they open a second location.  The Chicken Box 2 is beside the Cookout on Sugar Creek, and I must say its a nice size location, I think it's an old Shoney's or something but it's very roomy for those dining in.  They have the same menu and are open 7 days a week and have added a tasty looking breakfast menu that includes chicken and waffles(mental note to try as my eyes widened), pancakes, omelette's, platters, sandwiches, etc.  I may go as far to say that I thought the food was better compared to the Tryon street location, but I'll have to confirm that on my next trip.  I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I called in my order at 3 pm. I was told the order would be ready in 15 minutes. I ordered one veggie plate, one chicken dinner and one pork chop dinner. I arrive and have ti wait in line 15 minutes. Then was told they can't find my order. Then they find it. I pay and 45 minutes later, I am finally getting my order. Great food. Service needs improvement."}
{"text":"I was in town for a car show and decided to stop in based on YELP reviews. THANK YOU TO THOSE WHO POSTED A REVIEW OF THIS PLACE!!!!!  When you walk in the smell of fried chicken fills the air. You have to order at the counter and are given a number.  Then you take a seat and wait.  I had a fried breast, broccoli casserole, and mashed potatoes.  Let me start with the potatoes. The potatoes were good, but the gravy on top was great.  My grandfather used to say \"if you poured great gravy on your head your tounge will beat your brains out to get to it.\"  This is that kind of gravy.  Next the broccoli casserole.  It is the BEST I have ever had.  The broccoli is chopped really fine. The broccoli is mixed with what apears to be rice, cheese, and seasoning.  I am not sure how they cook it. My best guess is with a magic wand. It is GREAT.  Last is the fried chicken breast.  It was a huge piece of chicken.  It had to be served at about 250 degrees. So, be careful.  I knew it was hot, but it looked so good I could not help but try to eat it.  The first bite was all skin and it was AMAZING.  The skin is so crispy, salty, and cooked perfectly.  The interior of the breast, after it cooled a little, was perfect.  Juicy, moist, and paired with the crispy skin it may be the best fried chicken I have ever had.  DO NOT MISS OUT ON A GREAT MEAL!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Got the dark chicken meal. Perfectly cooked chicken. Fried okra was on par with every other fried okra I've had at much more expensive restaurants. Service was good too. 100% worth the money if you're looking for some superb soul food."}
{"text":"You have to look past the appearance to have a great experience here. You won't find a lot of  frills and stereo typical sit down restaurant decor, but man do they have something more important, FLAVOR!  I used to think that an uptown diner had the best fried chicken in town but, i was mistaken. I got a two piece white with two sides. The chicken breasts where ridiculously juicy  The mac and cheese reminded me of the extra fattening goodness that only someone that learned a recipe that has stood the test of time.   They have fried everything and I love it.  If you want something good off the grid then stop by the chicken box and enjoy the south at its best."}
{"text":"This place had the most horrible customer service and food service times in the world!!! If you like to wait up to 45 minutes for ONE dinner plate and enjoy looking at the nonchalant face of the cashier who looks like she hates being there, then by all means, enjoy!  I have called to place an order before hand numerous times and every single time I come to pick it up ( I live 5 min away) it is never ready or even close to being ready. It takes me 15 minutes just pay for my preordered meal. Then when they take my money it takes an additional 30 min to actually receive the dinner.  I try going at different time throughout the day thinking that I might have missed the lunch rush and will hopefully receive my meal a little quicker. WRONG!! Same thing just minus about 10 min from your initial wait time. The sad part that they actually have good food!! That's why for some strange reason I keep coming back ( not to mention it's so close to my house). The last 3 times I went to order food, I couldn't wait 30 minutes for food and was pretty much forced to leave by choice. I gave them 2 stars because their food is good but everything else sucks."}
{"text":"The food there was mediocre it wasn't that good but what was really gross was there were two large ants in my food I definitely will not be back"}
{"text":"I visited there today for the 2nd time. Customer service was poor and the the food doesn't make up for it. I had the fried chicken for twice and it's good, but nothing spectacular! I've also had the smothered pork chops with candied yams and macaroni and cheese. The Mac n cheese was HORRIBLE! It had a sour milk taste! The yams were straight out of the can! The pork chops were very tender and pretty flavorful. After visiting there twice I've seen enough to know that it's not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"Wow This place has really changed. I have live in the university area for quite a while now and have seen this place change over the years and I am sad to say I am disappointed. The food was terrible, cold, and they got my moms order wrong. The dining area was extremely cold and the tables were not clean and the tv was too loud. Needless to say I will not be back."}
{"text":"Pretty Pricey for Cheap Eats. I think my Chicken with a Sweet Tea was $9.50 or so...But the food was good and I went with my Friend who's Black and a cheerleader at UNCC. So, I got a lot of weird stares being the only semi-white guy there with the hottest girl in the restaurant.  haha good times"}
{"text":"The Chicken Box is awesome!  This place totally rates up there with Price's and it has better hours and is much less crowded."}
{"text":"Excellent fried chicken (reminds me of how my mom used to make it) and amazing greens!    When I'm in Charlotte on business and want some \"home cooking\", it's the spot."}
{"text":"Great food! The chicken and sides are great. The Tryon location is run down but the food is super. Try the broccoli cheese casserole and pound cakes."}
{"text":"I've definitely had hit or miss days from Chicken Box, but overall the experience has been largely positive. On the miss days, the chicken is a little greasy and the fried livers and gizzards are almost rock-hard. On the good days, this stuff is the best fried chicken and fried livers/gizzards that I've had in the area.   My dad has been taking me here since I was really young, and I've always loved the liver snacks. It feels so bad for you, but when they cook it right, the liver is still a little soft and the batter is nice and crunchy. The gizzards have more often than not been overcooked, but I've had really good gizzard snacks before. The chicken is well-cooked and the crispy skin on the outside is artery-clogging goodness. The best part is that you can get a super meal deal for about $5, and get some sides, too. That's usually what I get and you can't go wrong with the mac and chese and okra as sides."}
{"text":"My cousin and I were cruising by one afternoon and had to check out The Chicken Box. It was our first visit to a place neither of us had ever heard of, so we had no idea what to expect. When we walked in and saw the menu, I was shocked...it was huge!  More soul food selections then you could imagine. I'm always a bit skeptical about new places though, so I went with a favorite of mine, fried chicken.   Now, you may think I'm pulling your leg here, but I kid you not. This place had the BEST fried chicken I've ever tasted! I had the broccoli casserole and mac and cheese as my sides. Never tasted better sides. Even the sweet tea was just purely wonderful. The lady that took our order was as sweet as the tea, couldn't ask for better service. She recommended the sweet potato pie for desert, which was great as well.  I would highly recommend The Chicken Box to anyone looking for some truly great soul food. This little joint gets 5 stars from me, and I will make sure to stop in again for some more great food."}
{"text":"Well, this was only my second visit to the chicken box and.both times I left with a fullness in the stomach and an air of satisfaction. The fried chicken was second to none, and once a complement of hot sauce was applied,  heavenly. The collards and corn bread was hot, well seasoned, delicious. I had to dip a fork into the candied yams and should note that the only disappointment there was that I ate them all so quickly  there was no more.    This is a rather simple setting, not my \" take a date and impress her\" on the esthetic, but if she is just looking for some good, near down home cooking that would leave you with a burp and a smile, this could be the place......"}
{"text":"Decided to pick up dinner for the family tonight and I thought the Chicken Box would be satisfying. I appreciated the owner giving me a breast after learning the 4 piece chicken dinner I ordered were just too small. But the chicken was over cooked and i was so disappointed.  My daughter ordered the fish with yams and mac and cheese and enjoyed both. I was really disappointed in the wing selection. Because I have faith in this establishment, I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Today for lunch I decided to try this place based on my boyfriend's suggestion that the food was fantastic, however I was slightly disappointed... I ordered the Perch dinner with macaroni and cheese and green beans with a corn muffin for my sides. For starters I didn't like the fact that this place charges .29 cents for tap water. The green beans were bland to me they tasted like canned green beans!!!! The Mac and cheese was just okay not bad or good and the perch was okay as well. The only great thing about the place was the workers friendly attitude. But here's my verdict lets just say that my boyfriend is suspended for choosing places to eat for a while....      :)"}
{"text":"This was a hidden treat across the street from our hotel. Seems family run and very welcoming. We had a number of items in the menu. Fried chicken, Ox tails, fish, and more. The sides were great, especially the mac&cheese, greens, and yams. Definitely a welcomed addition to my list when in Charlotte. They have plenty of items on the menu including chitterlings and other southern favorites."}
{"text":"This establishment has gone to crap! I used to like Chicken Box, but now they are unprofessional, weird, too expensive (for their food) and the good doesn't taste the same. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great food and service! We brought our AAU basketball team here. They took very good care of us! Definitely recommend this venue."}
{"text":"Very good fried chicken. light and crispy but the pieces are kind of small.  The yams are out of a can.  Other than that, I love the mac and cheese and collards, fried okra are really good.  It is one of my favorie places in The University/Sugar creek area.  Make sure to try their desserts, kind of pricey but MMMmmmmm good!"}
{"text":"I love it. Ate lunch here two days in row. Fried chicken was crispy good. Black eyed peas with rice and collard greens. Cornbread. Sweet tea was good. Fast delivery. Took out one day. Ate in the next. Waitress was good."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times before.  It seems like its always hit or miss.  This time was a BIG miss!  I had the meatloaf, Mac & cheese, and stuffing.  The Mac & cheese was so dry and very bland.  The stuffing was burnt and it wasn't edible.  The meatloaf was just ok.  It also took 20 minutes to get my food which seems it could have been sitting out for a while.  I really want to love this place.  But, today reminded me why I only go 2-3 times a year.  I remember the 1 amazing meal I had and I somehow always hope I get that experience again.  All and all, I'd rather eat at Lola's uptown.  The food is much better and the people seem friendlier."}
{"text":"Was actually in town for a few days on business from Atlanta, a co-worker recommended this place....and I am VERY glad he did. I called in my order and went to pick it up, I ordered the chicken and fish (flounder) dinner  and a slice of lemon cake. DELICIOUS, the fish and chicken were both seasoned very well, not too salty but just right. Also the sides I ordered, broccoli casserole and mac n cheese were delectable.  Customer service was awesome, wish we had one in Atlanta. Next time I come back to Charlotte, i'll be sure to drop in again."}
{"text":"This place is so good!!  The fried chicken is juicy but not greasy.  The Mac and Cheese was baked and on point.  And the collards was delicious.  And they give you a big plate.  It was definitely sleepy time when I was finished my food.  Also, I was told by the staff that they do not use pork in any of their side dishes.  Good to know if you don't eat pork (like me).    I have to eat here again!"}
{"text":"I ordered baked chicken with stuffing, mac and cheese, greens, candied yams, and cornbread all for $13!!!! It was so delicious! I do suggest calling ahead they can get pretty busy. If you do have to wait order an Arnold Palmer (sweet tea lemonade mix) it's also just as tasty!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food has changed. I started eating here almost two years ago and it was really good. The mac & cheese has changed a lot. The baked chicken is always over cooked and the collard greens are filled with stalks. The service never comes by to give you any refills and when you call him (Tommy), he acts like you're bothering him to get you something. My husband always orders the fries pork chops and they never bring him a knife. When he ask for one they always bring a butter knife. We started keeping a steak knife in the car and bringing it in when we eat there. Today we noticed that they are doing a lot of construction, painting and moving furniture....so we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Charlotte I try to visit this spot. I normally get my food to go, but I decided to have Sunday dinner and dine in with some friends. The food didn't disappoint me. It was fast service and the food was very delicious, and The sweet tea was on point. The staff was professional as well. Keep up the great job."}
{"text":"If you want some pretty good soul food, this is your spot!  I have tried the fried whiting fish and the fried shrimp both were delicious!  Seasoned well and had a nice crisp to them, no sogginess, which I cant stand! and not too hard.  There are many side options to choose from; I can vouch for the macaroni and cheese, creamy and cheesy yum, the yams, sweet and delicious, collard greens, seasoned right and not too soupy and the broccoli casserole, how can you say no to broccoli and cheese?!  There are specials throughout the week check the website before you go or look for signs posted on the door and/or walls for these deals.  Also when you choose a meal you get a choice of a roll, muffin or hush puppies.  The staff is friendly and works quickly"}
{"text":"I'm not sure about the area this place is in since I'm new in town, but the food is amazing. I had fried chicken and it was the best I've ever had. Even the side items were good. They had things like Chittlins, Pig Feet, Oxtails, stuff you don't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"Love the chicken gizards and livers. Chicken, Greens and cabbage are good."}
{"text":"Area kinda shady...but best fried chicken in the city by far. Great prices also, I always recommend it to anyone who ask about chicken or soul food."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time yesterday with friends and had a great time! The staff was extremely friendly and attentive , and the food was phenomenal! I am so disappointed I had not eaten here sooner! The portions were more than generous with the entrees and the side-items. My lunch with tea came to  ~$8, but there are more/less expensive items on the menu. Def will be going back again!"}
{"text":"We could not have found a better place for Sunday dinner than Chicken Box.  We arrived about noon and there were a lot of people having dinner after church.  You order at the counter from the bewildering array of side order items.  It was really hard to narrow it down.  Ms T and I ordered a two piece and three piece dark dinner respectively with fried okra, black eyed peas, cole slaw, pintos and collards.  We chose corn bread muffins as our bread.  Wow, I'm getting hungry thinking about it and I just ate.  The chicken was very hot, fresh and juicy.  The salt was just right.  The coating was light, crisp and tender.  This is very good straight ahead fried chicken.  It is not peppery, either red or black.  The sides were all good.  Pintos were plain, perfectly cooked, perfect salt, one of my favorite things.  The greens had no meat or fat, in fact they have a little sign saying that they do not use pork fat/lard in their cooking, so I guess these greens are pretty healthful.  They were mild and flavorful, with perfect salt again.  The slaw was a fine Carolina chop with a very good creamy dressing that was slightly but not too sweet with good depth.  Black-eyed peas were similar to the pintos, plain, no meat, but flavorful and tender.  Ms T did not like the fried okra as well as she usually does.  I will have to yield to her expertise, put I liked it.  She felt it had been parboiled before frying, leaving it a little soggy.  It had mild but nice okra flavor coming through the light coating.  The corn muffins had good corn flavor.  This was a great meal of southern cookin'.  Again, we have found a place that is exactly what Sweetie Pie's in St Louis has the reputation for, but has completely failed to earn.  I have no idea when I will ever be in Charlotte again, but I would not say never.  When I am, I will eat at Chicken Box.  Might have to try the other location.  Strong four stars."}
{"text":"Low pretense chicken soul food joint.  run down appearance, deliciously crunchy chicken.  Flavorful green beans, fries, and hush puppies.  Be warned, they're using very, VERY excessive breading to make small pieces seem bigger.  luckily, I really like breading."}
{"text":"This one's a winner.  The closest I had ever come to soul food was that Aretha Franklin scene in The Blues Brothers.  So, I had to try this place since I was in town.    Super friendly service that is very patient and helpful for any newbie.  Even the other patrons were friendly and helpful.  Based on all the local clientelle that came in during my meal, it must be really authentic.  It all tasted great, was very filling, and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"The original owners are back with the OLD name Chicken Box, menu as changed.  It was empty when i arrived around 6 pm.  Half of the menu was handwritten and taped on the front of the registers, and some of the menus items were not listed but in the system (i.e kids plates, you have to ask.  I ordered chicken breast dinner with two sides and kids plate with one drum stick, i had to order another for a dollar, mac&cheese, onions rings are a side but extra.  It cost $17.00 (1 chicken breast/2 drums sticks.  It took approx. 25 minutes.    One more thing I forgot..THE CHICKEN BREAST tasted like it was dropped into a bowl of SALT, very high sodium content."}
{"text":"The only bad thing I can say is that Chicken Box is an 1.5 hour drive from my home.  But, it gives me a reason to come back to Charlotte.   I have not had fried chicken this good in more years than I can remember.  The batter was light crunchy batter encapsulated the moist flavor chicken.  What an explosion of goodness with every bite.  Very low key restaurant that allows their food to speak volumes.    I truly enjoyed my meal as did my wife and son.  This is now our goto chicken place every time we are in or near Charlotte!!!!  A definite family and friend recommendation as well as a repeater!!!!  If you are in Charlotte, even passing through along I85, you need to swing in."}
{"text":"Here's the run down: -Customer service SUCKS! The staff gave me that grumpy old men feel  -Chicken was salllty! Omg  -Dressing tasted like it came from a TV dinner  -Yams...I was rooting for you!!! We were all rooting for you! You failed. The yams were hmmm...they were so bad I can't even find the words. Hard and old, just UGH -Mac n Cheese was a joke! Is that Kraft singles I taste??  -Whiting...blah.  I will neeeeevvvver go back."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations! I had the fried chicken. It was tender and not greasy. The yams were tasty. Sweet but not overbearing. I will definitely visit again when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I stopped by the Chicken Box to grab lunch today.  I hadn't been there for a long time, and I was really excited about getting some of their fried chicken, mac & cheese, and collard greens.   When I pulled into the parking lot I noticed a big sign hanging down from the roof proclaiming that the original owners were back and it was under new management.    I hate to say it, but the original owners have really messed up a good thing.    When I went inside the huge menu board that listed all the amazing soul food side dishes were gone.    I guess the new management is trying to just rip off Price's by having the only side dish be mediocre coleslaw and bad tater tots.    The real shame is that they obviously changed the fried chicken recipe.    Does anyone know where the old managers went?  I need more of there home cooking.  This new chicken box cafe is terrible."}
{"text":"I eat here atleast once a week! Amazing crispy chicken!! They deliver and the cobbler is so so good."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Save yourself the disappointment and find another place to eat. The candied yams were over cooked, the green beans were sweet, the macaroni and cheese was bland and runny, and the chicken was undercooked, It was still pink inside and had a weird smell. I came hungry and left hungry... Couldn't finish anything."}
{"text":"This is where it's at.  The best soul food in town.  Prices really cater to working class folks.  I love the food and service.  Family oriented and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"So i have heard some pretty good thing about this place so i decided to give it a try one day.  The restaurant was very dirty inside which kind of makes it hard to enjoy a meal. I got fried chicken with mac n cheese and fries. The chicken was extremely salty to the point where i couldnt even eat it. The fries tasted like they had been cooked in the same fry bin as fish which made them pretty hard to eat as well. As for the mac n cheese it was bland and not to my liking. On the upside the service was very good, but i can guarantee i wont be back."}
{"text":"I think they have pretty great fish sandwiches also I like their Turkey dinner. The cakes are kind of dry in my opinion."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I chose the meal deal for $5.99 and it came with one smothered pork chop a side of rice and gravy and a roll. The portion size was horrible. It was about a half cup rice and the pork chop was very tiny!( the roll was almost bigger) The gravy was so bland and the temperature was luke warm. This was my second time visiting and not being happy. You can get better tasting and a larger quantity of  food at other restaurants nearby...I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"I love the original Chicken Box on N. Tryon but I decided to stop here because it was closer. I called ahead and spoke with a nice lady on the phone to order a 3pc whiting with cabbage, cornbread and black eyed peas. I told her about the offer on yelp for a free sweet tea with entree purchase and she asked that I just bring it with me and I would be fine.  When I arrived the man at the register was in the back and came out complaining about another employee. He said to a client waiting for her order, \"You see what I have to deal with!?\"  He and that client proceeded to have an exchange about the other employee's \"attitude\" while 3 other clients awaited his service. Needless to say, the lady in front of me (who was next in line) was displaying perturbed body language, which he completely disregarded.  When it was my turn, he asked for my order and I stated that I'd already called in for a pick up order. Instead of asking for my name and looking it up in their system, he proceeded to play a guessing game, that took about a minute and a half. Finally, he asked my name and said it should be out shortly. I informed him of the yelp coupon (that's available with check in) for the sweet tea. He condescendingly stated, \"Ya'll be usin' these old coupons! Here's the coupon we got right now.\" He then passed me a folded copy of the menu (yeah,the menu!). I explained him that I was confident it was valid as it was on the yelp page and was only available with check-in. He angrily went and got the tea and told me my total was $8.45. When I pulled out my card he said, \"That will be $9.45.\"  I explained to him that he'd just given me a different total and he said that was because of the tax. At this point, I didn't want to argue over the dollar.   When he brought me my order he complained about the bag, clearly trying to blame the other employee. He got a new bag. I checked my order and started to leave. He said, \"We good?\", instead of offering a genuine apology. At which point, I just walked off.   Now on to the food...  The whiting was hot and delicious.  The cabbage tasted like it had been sitting for days and had a light brown tint versus the typical green color. It had a strange aftertaste.  The black eyes peas tasted like they'd been sitting as well and were bland and watery. The cornbread muffin was dry and lackluster.  The tea was perfectly sweetened.   The one on N. Tryon is always a perfect experience and I'll keep going there as I have been since the 1990s.   Avoid this location and drive the extra 5 miles for a fabulous experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in the \"Queen City\".  Family operated (maybe not officially but.....)  This isn't a place to go if your lookin to get your stomach full and eyes full of pretty lil trinkets and pictures. GO TO AN ART GALLARY...  but.. if you're in the mood for some GOOD MOOD FOOD... travel on over to Chicken Box. They have EV-ER-E THING.  OX TAILS CHICKEN FEET (HUH???) GIZZARDS FISH (FILET OR BONE IN) BURGERS RIBS SALADS (I THINK) HOT DOGS LIVER (RICE AND GRAVY) SHITerlings  and too much other stuff... From the small list above.. You should be able to gather that its probabaly nothing that they DON'T DO. Friendly service, prompt.  You place your order and they will call your ticket number once finished. OR... they may walk it out to your table.   When you go inside.. the whole wall behind the cashier is the menu. YES... THE WALL!!  GOTTA LOVE IT!!!  GO enjoy... if you don't like it... there is a Burger King across the street that has ummmm fresh fries!!   Cheer's"}
{"text":"Great prices! Good food. I love the Talapia, coldslaw, and brocelli casarole.  The owners are always around, helping out serving and making sure things are going well with customers. Close to Downtown and right around the corner from NoDa. Love this place."}
{"text":"Price's Chicken Coop was challenged Tuesday, really challenged - for the title of Best Fried Chicken, according to my tastes anyway. I've had this place on my food bucket list for quite a while, but Charlotte can be such a pain in the rear traffic wise (just getting in and out of town) that I'd kind of put off going here.But Tuesday, we selected 3 places to visit and this was one.  This restaurant is located in a less than stellar area, and the it looks like it was formerly a fast food place of some kind - even had a drive thru area that is a complete state of disrepair.The bright yellow top section of the building is hard to miss.  It is in fact a fast food setup - you order at the front, pay, get a number, and await you food. The time to get that food is not really fast food style, it will take a little longer than that - which is why there are a lot of call in orders for pickup. There is plenty of seating here.  They have the full soul food menu - Pork Chops (Fried or Smothered), Fried Seafood (Shrimp, Perch, Croaker, Flounder, & of course, Whiting), Meatloaf, Chicken of all manner (Fried, Smothered, Baked, BBQ, Gizzards, Livers, & FEET!) BBQ Ribs, BBQ Pork, Oxtail, Beef Stew, Pigs Feet, Chitlins Turkey Wings, great soul sides, a few sandwiches (including BBQ Pork, Fish, & of course, Pork Chop), and an array of home made desserts.  We chose the 3 Wings Dinner with -  Mac & Cheese, and Collards ($8.35), and the BBQ Pork Sandwich ($7.50 or so). The chicken was absolutely outstanding - perfectly fried, perfectly seasoned, with an amazing, thin crust exploding with flavor. You could just eat the skin and be in heaven. Can't say that it is better than the chicken at Price's, but it very well may be the equal, and getting in and out with your food is a little easier here.  Both the Mac & Cheese and the Collards were superb, as well, and also perfectly seasoned. The sides with the dinner are small, really small - so this is not a real value meal, but if you are too concerned about the cost of this food, you've pretty much taken your eye off the prize.   The BBQ Sandwich is rather pricey, but it is huge - loaded with tender, smokey pulled pork with a nice BBQ sauce, with a touch of sweetness - this is not the typical NC style BBQ Pork, but it is outstanding, in its own right. We also chose a piece of Cream Cheese Pound Cake, which was very, very good.  Not the cheapest place, not the greatest area, nor the greatest ambience - but this is outstanding chicken, outstanding soul food.   Oh Yeah, we'll be back - traffic or no traffic!"}
{"text":"If you were in NoDa, you've probably driven past Chicken Box and never even realized it.  If you ever noticed Chicken Box, what probably caught your attention is how many cars are out there!  That's what caused me to stop by the first time.  The parking lot was so insane that they had 2 people directing traffic outside!  I actually found a great recommendation on yelp and ended up calling in my order from the parking lot.  By the time I drove past the window, it was ready.    Hands down though, they sell the best friend chicken I've ever had IN MY LIFE.  It's pure soul food / comfort food.  With their chicken dinners you get several sides, it's almost too much to contemplate.  Biscuits, hush puppies, amazing collard greens, mac and cheese.  It's amazing I've only been there twice.  It's an adventure though, it's always bustling with people and you have to be a little aggressive to get your order in, but it's well worth it.     Love."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant...there is nothing that I haven't tried that I did not enjoy. Which is really hard for a restaurant to maintain when they have a large menu. Everything always taste fresh. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Came into town from Raleigh with my mom a few weeks back and we decided to eat here. We saw commercials for this place all the way in Raleigh. I must say the food was really good with just the right amount of seasonings. I ordered the baked chicken white/stuffing, collards, mac & cheese. Lets not forget the sweet tea and roll. This was excellent and my mom ordered the same thing with a side of sweet potatoes. If you're  ever in town you must try this place out."}
{"text":"The food at Chicken Box continues to satisfy my hungry tummy.  As we usually do, we ordered meals to go; the dining room was empty and there was no ambiance to speak of.  We all ordered whiting - how can you go wrong?!  It did not disappoint.  Three huge pieces, although I would have preferred just two and a bigger scoop for the vegetables (yams - not overly seasoned, probably healthier; cabbage, and pintos and rice).  Everything was made to oder and quite tasty!  I am glad the restaurant has been able to weather the econmic storm and is still in busy.  When your stomach is crying for something to eat and you are in the area - go to Chicken Box!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at the other location at least several times per week thru out the eighties and nineties since we had a retail business right next door on Tryon Street. We sold that business many years ago and I haven't had the great fried gizzards, livers, and chicken for quite a while now.  For several years now I've been meaning to stop by the new location on Sugaw Creek and finally did on Tuesday, 7/8/14, craving gizzards. It was 11 am and they had just opened for the day.  To my disappointment their food truck hadn't arrived yet and they were out of gizzards. I overheard another customers' conversation and I believe he had ordered fish, croakers I think, and they were out of that too. I believe a restaurant should never run out of their products they sell.  But anyway, I got an 8 piece order of chicken and an order of livers since they were out of gizzards and away I went. I couldn't wait to get home so I started in on the livers as soon as I got in the car. The first thing I noticed the oil used to fry the food appeared old. That's another no-no for a restaurant that specializes in fried food. Got'a keep that grease fresh! The next thing I noticed - NO SALT! The crust on the chicken and livers was excellent - except the lack of salt! Maybe they just forgot to add it to the breading mixture.  Any restaurant  can have a bad day and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Will I go back? Absolutely - next week!"}
{"text":"The only place I look forward to traveling to the Charlotte area for. Neck bones, chitterlings, fried chicken, oh my! All cooked with southern love."}
{"text":"I love chicken box! Great food, delicious flavors! All of the food tastes very fresh, their fried chicken is SOOOOO GOOD. The prices are good for the quality of the food and there is always a server there going around to all the tables, making sure that everyone has what they need. The people who work there seem genuinely nice."}
{"text":"One of the first things my son ever read out loud was the sign outside of Chicken Box. He wanted to eat there, and I was a little put off by the exterior. A friend recommended that I give it a try, and I owe that friend gratitude forever. The thing about Chicken Box is that the appearance is not fancy, but the food is AMAZING!!! Breading on fried chicken, chicken tenders, etc, that is the perfect crisp, seasoned to perfection. Melt in your mouth perfectly sweet cornbread. My personal favorite is the fried chicken livers, and they are the perfect crisp and breading on the outside, amazingly seasoned, and the liver is melt in your mouth tender inside. Not overdone. This is very important. The sides are to write home about. Cole slaw is the perfect crunch, just a touch of sweet. The potato salad is so good, I can't describe what makes it special and original, I just know I can't leave a bite of it on my plate. I could list about ten different sides that I have tried that I love, from greens to yams to fried okra to broccoli casserole, the list goes on and on. The only thing I don't like about Chicken Box is honestly how hard it is to decide what you want to eat because everything is so delicious and mouthwatering!  Whenever we ask my son where he wants to go, he always says 'Chicken Box!' Oh son, I concur, I concur!"}
{"text":"We just wanted some good ole southern eats, some get in your belly soul food.  You walk in and place your order at a counter. The menu is big and on the wall. It being our first time, I wanted to try a little bit of everything so we ordered the following:  *Kids Meal with fish fillet and double side of mac and cheese *Gizzards *3 piece chicken wings *Smothered chicken with cabbage and green beans. *Smothered pork chop with greens and fried okra   We chose to dine in and so we sat our selves and waited for our food. And waited for our food. Then we waited a little bit more. Then they finally called our number. Everything came out looking delicious. But the key word here is \"look\". What made it so disappointing is that half of our food was cold. My pork chops were so cold in the middle and my hunny's chicken too. I didn't even eat my pork chop because it was too cold.   The mac and cheese was okay. The noodles were mushy and it was bland, it needed a little salt or something. The fish fillets were actually pretty good and we really enjoyed those.  The vegetables we had were alright. Fried okra was on point. It was hot and fresh and I just added a little bit of salt and it was so good. The other vegetable sides we had did not disappoint either but they did not wow our taste buds either.  The fried gizzards were banging. Perfectly fried and seasoned.  The fried chicken wings were on point too.   I actually liked the place. I should give them a two but what was good made up for what was bad."}
