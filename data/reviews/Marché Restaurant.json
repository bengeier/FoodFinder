{"text":"I went for brunch yesterday. I was hoping to order my usual veggie omelette + strawberry crepe w/ chocolate. However, they stop serving omelettes at 11. I had a hard time finding a replacement... I ended up getting a veggie plate.  For those of you who have not been here before: Marche is set up like a supermarket with certain food stations i.e. Crepe, Pizza, Omelette, Veggie, Grilled etc. You stop at these stations and order. Then they swipe your card. You pay on the way out.  This location is actually inside of a business complex, the Brookfield Place. It is surrounded by various stores. The restaurant put some tables, food court style in the building outside of the restaurant. This is by far my favorite Richtree/Marche location."}
{"text":"$10 pints of macro lager, smh.  Sushi was decent, pizza tasted off. I'd bet it's a nice place in many ways, but this beer price is egregious. I will not stand for it."}
{"text":"I am disappointed to see the quality of this place. It used to be one of my favourite hangouts before they had closed a few years ago. I went back for the first time since they reopened, and I was so sad. The interior decor and the food quality deteriorated to standard cafeteria level.  I remember before when I used to love trying their new menu items because they offered a good combination of food quality and market experience.  Sadly not anymore.  Let me explain: - fruit flies and insects in the food.  At the pastry corner, while trying to choose which pastry to have, there were insects nesting and flying around the food.  I told the counter lady and she did not even seem surprised, as if this was normal.... so we went to the waffle counter - waffle counter was not any better: 1) no whipped cream even though it is part of the deluxe waffle 2) came undercooked so it was very soggy  - poor customer service 1) told the customer service about this experience and was pretty much stared at as if I was overly picky 2) in spite of all these shortcomings they went ahead and charged for the gratuities (not sure why if we serve ourselves and the part that they are supposed to be in charge of such as cooking and cleaning up were not properly done)  I am also disappointed to see that they automatically include gratuities in the bill.  NOt sure why since: - customers have to line up, pick up and carry our own food and utensils (the only part they are responsible for is cooking and cleaning up) - they don't cook properly (components of the dish are missing and the food is undercooked) - they don't clean up (some tables not cleaned up yet even though the restaurant was not so busy and lots of insects on the food)  So needless to say I strongly discourage people from trying what used to be a good spot.  For alternatives try other locations (Eaton, Sherway Garden, York Mills)  I will try as soon as I can and post reviews later"}
{"text":"I really liked this place because of the many selections and different types of cuisine. Overall experience was good but when we paid seems like some of the items were charged way more than they were displayed. We paid almost 82CAD for quick lunch... I would suggest if you go there please double check the price before you hand your card."}
{"text":"Worst. Hot Chocolate. Ever.  They have a smaller takeout shop on the lower level of 181 Bay (across from the Hockey Hall of Fame, Starbucks, etc) and if you're seeking for cheaper-than-Starbucks afternoon pick-me-up, don't come here.  \"Swiss Hot Chocolate\" was lacking chocolate.  Pretty disappointed because usually their food has been pretty decent.  I don't expect miracles on the rare occasion that I get something from here, but I expected better than this."}
{"text":"The food is decent however it was very difficult getting my food at the different stations due to the lack of staff. Also the salad bar did have 2 staff members but they were busy chatting to ask me if I would like a salad. I give 2 stars all for the food and 1/5 for the service."}
{"text":"Marche (and formerly Richtree) is my fall back option for a place where I want to chat with friends without feeling the guilt of overstaying past I'm done my meal.  There aren't waiters but there's staff to help clear tables. It's all self serve with each food station offering something different.  Whatever you decide to get, your card gets swiped with the balance so don't lose it!  The food is mediocre at best but it isn't too pricey so I guess you get what you pay for.  I usually come here for their dessert waffle or crepe as I find their other desserts disappointing.  It's a great place if you just want something quick since most of the food is ready to eat with minimal prep or if you want to sit around and chill."}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointing. I had \"chicken chipotle gratin\" which in no way tasted like chipotle. Rather it tasted like flour, pasta, and boiled chicken - very bland.  The sautéed veggies from the other station were overcooked and very oily.  My friend's chicken was dry.  All told my meal was $17. Quite a kick, including the 12% auto-grat for counter (not table) service.  Anyone who raves about this place has looooow standards.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time when I was growing up, mainly for desserts. My regular order is a crepe but due to my last visit here, I am NEVER coming back. Over the weekend I payed a visit with my mother for some desserts. We payed over $12 for a small crepe, the size of a dessert plate with sour/non-ripe strawberries and powdery tasting chocolate sauce. In Scarborough I never pay over $10 for a crepe, not to mention the crepes are much bigger and have more toppings. Despite not enjoying the crepes as much, I returned home around two hours after my visit to a painful stomach ache which I thought would go away by the next morning, but here I am, three days later still suffering which I believe is stomach flu, as a result of something from this restaurant. Perhaps is was the water or the dirty silverware. I am not entirely sure. As for the service, we were never once asked how we were doing, for that matter we weren't even attended to. It pains me to say my family and I are never coming back here again, after multiple visits growing up. There are so many better options than Marché...please don't waste your time or money here. It is not worth the risk."}
{"text":"It was a nice place that you can get any type of food you want there. The idea of getting a card at the beginning and paying at the end was exciting for me. I felt so fresh when I went there. I felt I'm walking somewhere alive. It's pretty expensive for what it is though."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I feel the quality of Marche's food has consistently gone downhill for the past 5 years. Soup temperature is luke warm. Salad looks like it's been sitting out for hours-on-end. Pad thai noodle was blackened and burnt. Won't recommend or return again."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. It is always fresh and tastes as good as it looks. It is a bit too pricy even for downtown, but otherwise I would recommend!"}
{"text":"There is a great selection of food and I experienced very fast service, but this was because the restaurant was empty on both occasions.  I would have to agree with most of the reviews on mediocre food quality and it being very expensive.  They do also add a 12% gratuity, which is odd since you serve yourself.  We also had two very odd experiences with two different staff members (whoever cleans the tables) ...this guy stalked out our table and as there was a tiny bit of food on our plate he came beside me and stood there until I finished it then swooped away my tray and took off. He didn't say a word and I knew what he was waiting for, so I just gulped my last bit of food.  I figure should this happen again, I'm just gonna have to tell them to stop, but I also don't want to be rude.  It was so awkward and I have never experienced anything like this before.  Perhaps, a little too efficient at cleaning tables.  Please don't stalk customers, it's creepy.   I gave it 3 stars just due to that experience and I also think food quality needs to be improved.  Even the salad bar items are doused with too much oil.    It's worth a try and experience it for yourself, after all, I went back."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience - lots of delicious options, nice layout, good service. I wish they had an outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Stopped by marche for a strawberry crepe and a glass of wine. This place never disappoints.  Great place. I've never been disappointed when I come here. The crepes are the best. To die for."}
{"text":"Update: we got food poisoning... Probably from raw crepe... Seriously regret coming here...   When you couple bad service with bad food, what reason do you give to your customer to return to your establishment?"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile so I decided to take my wife for a nice dinner.   We will never return. Food is not fresh, way over priced.  And to top it off, a 12% surcharge (tip) to pay people to clean up tables with no actual service!   We walked through the restaurant and ended up not buying anything.   It's unfortunate and disappointing when a once successful restaurant decides to jack their loyal customers and serve un fresh food.   I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!    Save your hard earned money for a place that strives to make the customer happy."}
{"text":"I miss the original Movenpick. but since all we now have is Marche, I will have to live with that. I went there for a friend's birthday recently after not having been there for many years. I was a bit frustrating having to wait for food to be made. Super busy on a Sunday brunch. The quality of the food was decent but when I went to pay, my bill was $33.00. Wow, talk about sticker shock. Everything added up way too quickly. Be prepared to pay a lot ."}
{"text":"I came here on Valentine's Day with friends prior to a concert as reservations at nearby (more modestly-priced sit-down) restaurants were slim and we weren't willing to shell out a lot of money on a meal (we are, after all, university students and new grads). Funds are low. I wasn't sure whether to expect a bustling or quiet place based on the day we presented ourselves there. We ended up being surprised with a fairly large crowd of people of all ages enjoying Valentine's Day. Some dates...some families...some groups of friends. Very nice!  The concept: You're given a card upon entering and pick out your food in a sort of upscale food court and then eat at one of their many tables in different themed areas and pay upon leaving (12% gratuity automatically included in your bill). Simple enough.  I was impressed with their vast food selection although things can add up quickly when considering a small bowl of veggies can rack up $6 on your card. Ouch! I ordered a couple of slices of a warm pie but by the time I perused around a bit longer and went to sit down my food wasn't very warm so I can only assume it wasn't heated very much. Because it was Valentine's, they offered many nice desserts as well which was a very nice touch! I ordered a raspberry mousse in a chocolate tulip cup which was to die for!  The service areas are very clean and well-maintained as are the washrooms.   I wouldn't run to go there again but it was a very convenient choice in the downtown core with a nice concept!"}
{"text":"Over the years I've noticed that the quality of the food here has just gone downhill.   I love the concept of the restaurant- the fact that you can essentially see and experience the menu before you order. This being said, what I've ordered hasn't always tasted the best. Breakfast here is average (considering the price), but for lunch/dinner the pasta has not been the most flavourful, in fact it usually tastes bland. Last time I ordered chicken with mine and some pieces were ice-cold. The Alfredo sauce was thin and tasted like it came out of a can.  The desserts look delicious but, to be honest, every one I've tasted tastes horribly bland and is overpriced.  Great restaurant idea, decor and location but the food needs to be improved."}
{"text":"August 2017 Went back to Marshé yesterday afternoon. Didn't try the Japanese table but observed that the two chef/staff at least we're not watching streaming videos from their mobile phones. Wanted to compliment how fantastic the service from the other staff of Marshé specifically Van B. & Krish P. I have interacted with them during most of my visits and their customer service skills were consistently outstanding!"}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I've visited. It doesn't even deserve a one star rating. Walked in walked around for a while decided on a chicken breast with fries. After my wait I sat down took a bite out of chicken it was raw. I sat at my table for 40 minutes catching up on email and No one stopped by to see how the food tasted or ask anything. I still ended paying for my meal and left. I'm not the type to complain so I didn't but after telling the cashier about the raw chicken what happened he just looked uninterested and pointed at the pinpad for me to pay. Waste of money"}
{"text":"A seriously overpriced place with mediocre service. I used to love rosti, but they keep increasing the price, yet the quality's just getting worse."}
{"text":"bad side: unhappy, always sad, always tired, upset staff (except those who take the trays off the tables, and those who clean the tables). rude staff at the crepe and waffle section. don't put enough sauce, nutella, etc. really!   their other desert section better not be there, worst desert ever.   the bar is strange with it being open on two sides, one person serving so he constantly has to move look check his back if there are customers there. just put 2 staff there.   good side: good salad selection (it might even be too good and too much), good sea food area (except a bit too much oil), and ok italian section (also too much oil), amaznig grilled section and selection, good asian place.    the music at the new bar section has a different music than the marche so if you are there expect to hear two different music at the same time.    great kids play section, amazing ambiance in general, always clean bathroom, good place in general."}
{"text":"I *used* to love the Marche. Really. From the Movenpick days - yeah, I've been going to this restaurant for 2 decades now.   When this became a \"Marche\" again, I was overjoyed - Richtree didn't quite cut it. In its new incarnation as the Marche a few years ago, the food was fresh, tasty, cooked just right, and really vibrant.  Since then, the quality has slowly been falling off.  This past week, I've been there twice - for dinner both times. Both times, the food has been abysmal. Last week, I had the salmon filet with rice - the salmon was overcooked, the rice was completely tasteless (they used to serve fried rice with the salmon, but I see there is now a separate Asian station that provides fried rice). And I had an avocado shake that tasted like flour - I'm suspecting one or more moldy avocados.  That day, my friend had a stirfry from the Asian station and wound up with mild food poisoning.  Tonight, i decided to try something different, maybe a little healthier (well, not really). So I got two pieces of \"pie\" - one each of the beef and the spinach/feta. And I got a medium salad which i assembled from a variety of pre-cooked veggies. This time, *I* got the food poisoning - my friends merely said their choices were bland.  You have lots of choices downtown - give Marche a miss and head over to the competition. Your stomach will thank you for it. If you DO go to Marche, I'd strongly recommend going at lunch time when the food hasn't had the chance to sit out all day and spoil."}
{"text":"I find it really tacky when I look at the bill and it says that if you lose it you will have to pay the restaurant $100 or do dishes for two 12 hour shifts. Also, the food quality is not the greatest.  Good cuisine is not a result of food just being cooked with extra butter. This place is a bit better than a dud."}
{"text":"Steak wasn't cooked - at all.  Came as a group of four and we all ordered steaks on their steak special night. The counter was fairly busy and so the staff seemed quite flustered. I ordered my ribeye steak rare as I normally do. The dish was given to me no more than 45 seconds after I ordered it. I took it thinking they had put steaks on before I ordered in anticipation as there was a line of 8-9 people behind me.  In the group of 4, we ordered two rare and two medium rare steaks. What we received was three raw steaks that were slightly browned and one steak that was medium rare on one half and fully raw on the other half.  A display of truly questionable hygiene was when the person who received the half and half steak took it back to the counter (only realizing this after eating half of the properly cooked side). The remaining side had been cut into 5-6 pieces already as he was checking for parts that were edible. The staff stuck these back on the grill, which although demonstrated brilliant skill to ensure they didn't fall through the grill, was pretty gross.  The steak special is a pretty solid deal, but next time I'm going to take it to go so I can cook it at home."}
{"text":"I love that you can go to one place and have a selection of so many different types of food.  I always find something I like and I always find the food quality high.  The hours are good so you can go any time of day."}
{"text":"Neat concept for a restaurant.  Pick your food, they slide your card, and you pay when you leave.  Kids thought it was fun as they could all pick out something different.  Food was decent and fresh.  They have a kids meal ( 9 buck or so) and it gets you a drink, meal and dessert.  We didn't have that much food but our lunch w tip was 70 dollars.  I agree w others that a 12% tip for food that  I get seems high.    Still enjoyed our lunch but would put this as a \" if there was nothing else\" selection in our rotation."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. I love the location. But the food is overpriced and the gratuity fee just rubs people the wrong way. Maybe they should move to a smaller, more affordable location so they can charge proper prices for their food. It's sad going here, really. It used to be so much better. Sorry, but being open 365 days a year doesn't make up for the fact that their food is subpar and lacks quality. I highly recommend Richtree at the Eaton Centre for a much better experience."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good most of the times. However, if you go late (after 10 pm) on a weekday they seem to be desperate to get out of there and you might be handed a burned rosti or just a careless meal. Then you have to look at their disproval faces when you tell them to re-make something (we pay for it, right?). Coffee is great, that I always enjoy, but again, they close around 5-10 min before the other stations close. The most annoying thing of all is the tip, which is included, like it or not, and is very generous for them. I would happily leave a tip, but in this place you have to go and get whatever you want. I prefer to leave a tip for those who really served me (cleaned the table of dirty plates/glasses, smiled when I was actually seating there and talked to me and made my stay pleasant).  Last, but not least, PARKING. DO NOT GO BEFORE 6 PM (at least on a weekday) or they will charge you the MOST EXPENSIVE RATE EVER (if you are getting something out of this review, let it be this!!!), and the restaurant doesn't even give you a discount (as they usually do) for that matter.  I went with my family and we paid ~50 CAD in parking, we stayed from 5:45 pm to ~7:30 pm, crazy right? Overall, I used to love this place, specially for coffee, but there are great places where I can get similar food and I don't have to pay an obligated tip, and a very expensive parking.......it will be a while until I go there again."}
{"text":"Para nosotros fue una grata sorpresa este sistema de restaurant que asemeja a un mercado, en donde te ofrecen distintos tipos de comidas y de diversos orígenes (pasta, carnes, pescados y mariscos, sushi,etc). No lo encontramos caro, en comparación con un restaurante común. Lo que sí, si pides muchos platos la cuenta se te podría escapar de las manos. Lo que no nos pareció bien fue pagar \"gratuity\" porque nosotros mismos nos atendimos. Había mucha variedad de comidas y de buen sabor. Lo malo, falta ventilación y quedas pasado a fritura."}
{"text":"Many many years ago I came here before heading to see the National Ballet's Nutcracker at the Hummingbird Centre. I remember loving it but never recalled the name. As an adult I have heard about this restaurant many times and today I finally went back with a group of friends. It was wonderful!! I enjoyed a bagel with smoked salmon, a cheese spread and various veggies on top. Since it was an early lunch and not so long past breakfast I wasnt up for much more but I am excited to try it again. Everything from the fresh fruit, salads, pasta, freshly squeezed juice, stir fry , assortment of desserts. I could go on and on. Looked amazing! I will be back for more. Tip: I don't think they have gluten free options??"}
{"text":"I always enjoy my visits here, plenty of choices! And the food is tasty! Love the Japanese beers too!"}
{"text":"Newly renovated since taking over the space from Richtree). It is slightly more appealing than previously. I like the concept of ordering food in a 'market' atmosphere, with a variety of food stations. Service is friendly.   Decent lunch spot, largely because it is easily accessible via the underground PATH.  Also, good idea if you wish to split the bill fairly (as each patron receives their own swipe card to record their individual purchases).  I enjoy the coffee bar best.  If I weren't gluten free, I am sure I would thoroughly enjoy the pizza and crepes."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for some Sunday night ravioli and lager (why wouldn't you?!)  It was interesting, I liked the concept, layout and the variety of foods available.  My ravioli with mushrooms was nice, nothing special though. My friend loved her trout and vegetable rice.  My Mill Street lager was predictably fantastic and my friend found her glass of red wine delicious.   I'd definitely suggest Marche as more of a lunch place than a dinner joint - the nature of the restaurant ensures that co-ordinating the arrival of food to your table with your party is tough.  Prices were ok but I disliked the included gratuity, which I believe should always be discretionary. My friend ended up being charged 12.50 for her wine when she believed it was only $9 - I guess that's the main downfall of their \"card\" system, it's easy to overspend or simply be confused by prices as there is so much choice and so many menus around.  I would definitely go back though, there's so much on offer and I'm a sucker for unique concepts, which this place definitely has!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming to the Marché when I lived outside of the city. It was certainly a novelty... Wandering around, collecting different things to eat from all the various stalls. The food wasn't so bad then either. Perhaps it was because I was much younger and had lower standards... Who knows. Anyway, I went back a few days ago and had a savory crepe which tasted alright (nothing special) but mustn't have been very fresh because it made me quite ill later that night. The service was ok.. Again nothing special. My friend had rosti (potatoes) which in the past has been quite good but he found it to be lukewarm and mushy this time. It seems that the standards in this place are slipping and neither of us will be returning to the Marché."}
{"text":"We visited awhile ago, but the food was fresh and delicious. The concept of the marketplace is really entertaining and great for anyone wanting a unique meal - lots of variety. We stopped for a snack and the crepes and fresh juices were fantastic! If we are in the area again, it will be on our list of places to visit."}
{"text":"Great selection of international dishes but long lines = cold food by the time you get back to your seat."}
{"text":"Was here on Jan 9 2016.  We got the chicken pho soup, steak, 2 dozen raw oyster, mussel, Caesar salad, 1 smoothie and crepe.  Bill was 180. Everything we order was OK but the steak was bland.  It was pretty crowded when we left at 720pm.  We arrived at 6pm.  I didn't think it was worth the money but my kids seem to enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's ok, selection is limited and they use more oil/butter in prepping food. Cost is on par with the area, but more they charge a gratuity."}
{"text":"I stayed in Toronto only 2 days, and ate here on both..that should say something. Delicious food, exciting culinary environment...and an overall good feel to the place. I especially enjoyed breakfast here, and will not soon forget the french toast,,,Very Nicely flavored, and best of all,,offered with (for an extra fee) 100% natural Maple Syrup. Quality syrup makes all the difference, and is Not even offered in most so called high end breakfast establishments. I didn't get to try the brick oven pizza made to order, but it Looked (and smelled) Fantastic.   Their Italian food section offers Daily Fresh Homemade Pasta,,,which is sooooo Rare lately, and notably delectable.  They offer variety of meat selections, terrific desserts..a beer cornucopia....something for everyone. This is not a fine, dining, sit and be served restaurant, but the food is up there in quality and the atmosphere is classy, It's a Fun, place,,,,,,,,,,,,,IF.. you have the       M-o-n-e-y $$$ to spend. On vacation, and ready to splurge,,,? Then enjoy Marche a few times.. If you are penny,,,or even if you are dollar conscious,,,this might not be a place for you. You will Tip for services which you don't see, which saves the owner a few dollars in salary we suppose,,, If the food wasn't so well presented, I would only give 3 stars because of the cost,,but hey,,,,I was on vacation,,so..what the hey :) I say,,Enjoy..."}
{"text":"I've liked everything I've had here but the prices were really high! Service was excellent.  NOTE a 12% gratuity was auto added to my bill - I was there for a weekday lunch"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the quality of the food. Used to be so much better. It was a busy Saturday and chaotic. I absolutely would not go again. It felt like a tourist trap.  Expensive and bad food/service."}
{"text":"This is one comfy, relax place to enjoy brunch with friends.  You sit wherever you like to sit and no constant check up from the wait staffs, not to mention their coffee is awesome.  Food wise could be inconsistent.  Sometimes I come here for grilled fish and the portion and quality are always inconsistent.  Price for the drink also tends to be expensive.  But it's still a very good self serve spot to sit and relax, and the food is always fresh. Staff is always friendly as well."}
{"text":"Took my daughter here after the Raptors game. It was  the first time going back in many years. I was quite disappointed. The service was slow, and almost everything we ordered was disappointing. My daughter had the pasta and cream sauce which was tastless, the gelato was one of the worst we have had and my strudel? left much to desired. The except was the savoury crepes. I ordered the smoked salmon, very good but the service was very slow. The cook didn't know whether it was  pesto basel based or pine nuts based. Had to skip the pesto. This restaurant is quite expensive and was note worth the price."}
{"text":"How nice it was that the best meal I had in my 5 day trip in Toronto is at a Food Market place near the Union Station.  The ingredients was fresh, and each piece of ingredients play a key \"flavor\" role such as the red bell pepper in the sandwich that enhance the flavor of the sandwich."}
{"text":"the napoleon dessert i had here was interesting.. as I was eating it I found some banana slices in it that's a twist. was caught off guard by that. i'd prefer it without the banana.   marche is a convenient place to stop to get something quick as there's nothing in the area that's open as late and offers so much selection.   i don't like the fact they ding you gratuities up front without you asking .. guess that why i see a lot of people doing take out to avoid the charge.   here's tip: grabs some complimentary candies after you exit the cashier.  (jub jubs, gummy bears, sour keys, lollipops)"}
{"text":"We use Marche's catering services for business meetings and presentations and for the most part the food is pretty good. They don't have much variety for wraps or sandwiches and they take forever to send invoices for corporate accounts. Almost 2 years passed and they started chasing us for outstanding bills from the beginning of 2014... If you want something made fast, okay quality, and for cheap then this is right up your alley."}
{"text":"Marche' is a unique experience. It was my friends and my first time dining here and when we were seated we were given a card. We weren't explained HOW it worked so we kind of idly sat down for a few minutes observing others before we figured out we had to get up, choose our dish then \"pay\" with our cards and we'd checkout after we had finished eating.  My friends opted for pasta and pizza, both were great but the line was the longest and it took them quite some time to choose their meal. As I was starving I opted for one of the shorter lines and chose sushi. I grabbed the salmon special of the day which included a spicy salmon roll, sashimi and maki. The sashimi was nice and fresh, the roll was... not great. It wasn't HORRIBLE but I wish I didn't get it. Didn't have any flavour. My meal set was $17.99.   They do have free water which is near the bathrooms, if you don't want to purchase a drink.  After our meal we left to checkout, please note that if you do not have a card they will not let you out. My friend had a baby and they even gave a card for her oddly enough.  I likely won't be back. I'm not a fan of serving myself, especially since it's a pretty packed place and getting around isn't the easiest. If I go out and am paying for a meal I'd rather just wait to be served."}
{"text":"My first ever Marché experience. I've always heard about it from friends who live in Toronto, so last weekend during my stay over there, visiting it was #1 on my list. It's a mix of a big restaurant(s), and a market.  You walk in and get a card (which you use to order). Inside, there are many types of food, from pastries, to salads, Asian, Italian, deli, and a meat section (to name a few). The ordering process was smooth, you get the food and sit anywhere you want.  I ordered a pasta salad and a pepperoni focaccia, both were amazing. Then came the dessert, I went for the Belgian cheese tart, it was a bit heavy but heavenly!  If you're in the area, I urge you to give them a visit."}
{"text":"What is a pass through the downtown corridor without visiting Marche? My colleagues and I have been visiting this place since the mid 2000s and it's always been a bit of a hit and miss. At times it's been spectacular, with great service and consistently belly filling food. This time around though, it was a sloggingly slow mess of a time. Ordering two entrees (a  hodge podge of a mess 'Banh Mi' chicken on a bun and a steak). The steak took about 10 mins while the Banh Mi sandwich took 25mins! Yes 25mins with 3 people working behind the counter. No lineups just very slow. The steak was ok, nothing spectacular and the Banh Mi was mediocre at best - no coriander, no sliced carrots, just a grilled chicken breast, a few thinly sliced ginger pieces and a bun. Amongst some of the other items my colleagues and I ordered were, mango smoothie, slice of strawberry shortcake and a small cup of cotton candy - total came out to $77. Will I be going back, not anytime soon. Just not enough bang for my buck."}
{"text":"Marche used to be the place to eat in downtown T.O.  Not anymore......... I dropped in for dinner, & my budget was $20.  The cheese pie was ok, as was the muffin and coffee - leaving $5 for a nutritious vegetable.  Guess what?  Their most economical veggie starts at $5.99 and goes up from there!  I wrote to the management to suggest changes so I could get a decent meal for $20.  They  did not respond.  I wrote to them again, and I got a silly reply, explaining what I told them already  i.e. that their vegetables were too expensive!  That's it for me and Marche.  Once burned, twice shy.........good-bye!"}
{"text":"Food tastes quite nice. But it's extremely pricey for something that could be found somewhere else. But the environment is amazing and I guess your money is really just going there."}
{"text":"TOURIST TRAP!  WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!  $5 for a small glass of orange juice?  WOW!  This place is just overpriced.  The concept is good but the food is just average.  Live cooking?  Ya you do realize that those people aren't really chefs, they just mix and match sauces.  This place reminds me of university cafeteria but charges way more.  Knock 30% off the price and I will come back maybe.  12% gratuity is just ridiculous, it's a self served restaurant!!"}
{"text":"For those of you who don't know, Marché isn't really a restaurant but a marketplace as the name suggests.  At Marché, you are immersed into an environment where you can interact with a variety of international street vendors serving up food with the freshest of ingredients.  You create a tab by logging it on your Marché card and you pay for all your consumed items when you leave.  It has always been quite a unique concept.  But for me, the novelty of Marché has come and gone...for the most part.  It's no longer a place that comes to mind when I am deciding where to dine out.  Gone are the days that I crave for a Rösti, a Swiss pan-fried potato dish that the chain is known for (at least for me).  However, when I am in the vicinity of one just out of happenstance, the thought of their mouthwatering Napoleon Square is enough to allure me back.  It's hard for me to resist such a delicious treat.  The Napoleon variant at Marché contains a generous amount of velvety smooth custard and strawberry slices sandwiched between two layers of flaky puff pastry.  On top, it is finished with powdered sugar and whipped cream.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Speaking purely from a 19-year-old university student's point of view. I love this place! But purely for the atmosphere and maybe if I picked something else to eat. My three girlfriends and I, not being quite satisfied with our dinner at Lucien (other words: don't go) nearby on Wellington, were strolling around looking for something to do or somewhere to have a good standby drink/snack while we discussed life, etc. etc.  We walked past this place before dinner. But as we looked through the windows and decided to go in. Entrance is a little hard to find but there are signs. I like how the food isn't expensive but you get something different than your down-the-street Timmie's. Not that Tim Horton's isn't great.  I got a slice of fruit flan. MaryAnn (I think) at the counter asked me if I wanted \"custard\". It was this white, thick sauce with small flecks of vanilla bean. After replying, \"no thank you!\" she proceeded to ladle on a splat of sauce. Oh MaryAnn. I could feel my inner 3-year-old coming out as I frowned immediately. But you must remember, I told myself, you are paying 4.99 for dessert, not 14.99. So you shouldn't expect the service to be astounding. The flan was huge and covered the diameter of the plate. It was also sickeningly sweet and used dry sponge cake instead of real egg custard. Inner 3-year-old again. But at least the crust was a chocolate lined cookie crust! And the water was free!  It is a very do-it-yourself experience, which I am used to and comfortable with. It is a comfortable place to be and kill time. As we discussed life, nobody came up and bothered us or put pressure on us to pay and get out. The seats were comfy, the lighting was great and the bathrooms are BEAUTIFUL!! Trust me on this. It can really be anything you want. You can make it a family restaurant (cotton-candy machine HELLO!), you can make it a quick lunch stop or you can make it a place for a late-night coffee and people-watching. The staff was nice and although MaryAnn's sauce incident was less than desirable, I will come back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"I thought this was a really cool place. Lots of stuff to look at and a good place to go if people want to eat different things. Some items looked better than others, yes, but in the end all the veggies we got and the pizza were both delicious! I also thought those things that we got were some of the better deals, other items seemed overpriced. Like others have said, I think the forced 12% gratuity in a \"market style\" restaurant is BS. Oh well, still enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"Horrible hygiene. Surprised they don't get inspected.  Walked in. Met the roach and walked out.  Interesting thing is the cashier and maitre'd were not phased. Before apology it was \"did you kill it?\" I said no. Then it was \"was it there or there? Cuz we have seen a few\". I said bye and walked out."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"They have this nice little salad bar section where you can add whatever you want to the box and weigh it when you pay. Offering a large selection of hot items and cold salads, it's tempting to grab a quick lunch from the salad bar. However, be aware that the cost also goes up fast if you want to try everything they have on the salad bar. Overall, good selection of items to choose from."}
{"text":"I think if Marché actually used these reviews as a way to improve their customer's experience they would lower the prices 15-20% ... am I right guys? The food is mediocre and the prices are outrageous. I actually felt physically angry when I found out a 12% \"service fee\" was added to my bill. When I questioned it (because I clearly remember getting my own food and not actually getting service) I was told \"it's for the people behind the counters\" .... really? I thought it was up to the employers to make sure the staff was adequately compensated. Not the patrons who are already being over charged.  Not cool Marché, not cool."}
{"text":"Marche certainly deserves a star for the convenience factor. I love that everything is charged to one card, except that one can easily overload their tray because scumbag brain thinks it's a buffet!   Similar to Richtree, Marche presents itself like marketplace. You can purchase anything like coffee, dessert, crepes, salad, pizzas...etc. I usually come here to grab a cup of coffee since there's usually no line up. Price of coffee is comparable to Second Cup or Starbucks, but they offer more tea choices.   I was very excited to see them sell macarons for under $2.00, and so many flavors to choose from! The macarons were disappointingly stale, and I wanted to spit my first bite out onto a napkin.. I guess this is the downside to the convenience factor that customers can grab something quickly. I wouldn't know how long that macaron has been sitting out there. Thank goodness for complimentary lemon water!  I wouldn't suggest coming here for freshness/quality, but if you're in a rush and want something fast, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Lots of interesting variety of food here. Great place to go with the family especially when everyone wants to eat something different. Good desserts."}
{"text":"Easily some of the worst food I've ever had. Even after thoroughly mentally preparing myself by reading the other reviews, looking at the pictures of unappetizing dishes, and understanding that there's an automatic 12% gratuity, I think the reality STILL fell short of my expectations.   It seems that I had the illusion that because there were so many choices here it would be a good idea to come for a group lunch - after all, they can't screw up everything right? Unfortunately, it must have been my unlucky day as three of the numerous stations failed entirely. The sushi was entirely tasteless, with the thinnest layer of sashimi possible, stale rice and no finesse in preparation at all. The pasta was drenched in oil - we couldn't finish it because it was literally swimming in a layer of grease near the end. The tea! WOW. Lukewarm. Need I say more? I mean, how difficult can it be to put a tea bag and hot water together?  The best part of the \"service\" was when we were handed the cards (which are used to pay for your meal) at the entrance. The girl smiled at us and it only took 1 try to get her attention.  1 star for the beautiful environment. Nice ambience, clean, and quiet enough to hold a decent conversation."}
{"text":"I met up with a few friends after the half marathon race today for brunch.  The nice thing about Marche's it is great for big groups - there were 9 of us and it worked out perfectly.  Everyone was able to order their own food in the market at their own pace.  We were all able to chat in a casual environment.  The downside with Marche's is that they are trying to be a jack of all trades with the food.  The food is good but not great.  You can get better food elsewhere but the atmosphere and ambiance is what draws you in.  From what I ordered today, I do not know if I would say I was blown away.  You have to experience the food for yourself and then make your decision about it.  If you are Bay Street area, Marche's is worth checking out for the experience."}
{"text":"Marche is my go to place when I visit Toronto.  Their napoleons, cheesecakes, juices, seafood stew and pastas, mmmm all delicious.  I have yet to try the other dishes.  I also love their decor and setup particularly how they made it look like a market.   I wish there was one in the US.  I have no complaints about the service.  I gave it four stars because I have no complaints. I left one star out because I have yet to try their many other selections."}
{"text":"Disappointment for a few reasons.  I thought it would be a great option for family with various ages and dietary preferences and needs.  I asked for grilled chicken for my young son and they gave me breaded chicken fingers.  That wouldn't have been so bad except that the guy argued with me telling me that I \"specifically\" ordered breaded chicken ....for my gluten free son with a digestive disorder??? Seriously??? And then he acted as if he wouldn't make a grilled chicken without charging for the misunderstanding.  OK, walk on after that and the red curry with vegetables I ordered was just \"OK\".  My 2 other children didn't finish or even want to take to the hotel the rest of the flatbread they had ordered.  AND then when I was paying, one of the EXTREMELY rude cashiers physically pushed the cashier who was in front of me to another register and made me move as well - no clue why.  Then, when my nice cashier was trying to help me and needed to remove a soda that should have been listed under my young son, the EXTREMELY rude cashier grabbed my cards from her, pushed her aside and started to take over interrupting everything we were trying to explain.  She was EXTREMELY SNOTTY to her co-worker; I was so offended by how she treated her that I had to speak up.  It was just so uncomfortable and odd - and the food was just \"OK\"."}
{"text":"I have been to the Marche quite a few times in the last 10 years.  It's better than good, it's very good.  Not excellent.  But some dishes are duds (but don't let this stop you from dining here). Just check things out before you decide what you want (you can view the chefs cooking so you can get an idea). Their core dishes are what I call \"continental\"; but they increasingly have more variation.   Favourites are:  crepes, fish and potato latke (get it with sour cream), there pasta is usually good (they make different kinds, so check it out to see if it tickles your fancy when you are there), salad bar (flat fair price), fresh juices, soft drinks, coffee, and roast meats.    Crepes and waffle desserts are pretty consistently good.  So it's definitely a good place to just go have coffee. Or if you need to cool down,  they have san pelligrino, beer, and free water.   The ambiance is commercial european - market feel. And it's spacious.  Well air conditioned in the summer - so comfortable and fresh. You walk around with your tray and get your food from the different stations.    Sometimes it can get a little busy - but that's good - lively is good - but it's good that it's never hectic.  Part of the Marche is well lit - so if you like that you can sit in that area.  But there's an indoor patio as well which is nice at night (candle lit; so if you prefer dim light just go on the patio).   And there is security in the building to keep the riff raff out.  It's also great for all ages. If I was a parent, I wouldn't mind my teenage kid going here with their friends for something to eat. And it's more comfortable bringing them here as opposed to a fancier restaurant.  And if you have a big diverse group - everybody can find something to their liking.   It's nice to come here and chill.  It's open late on the weekends, so you can sit and chat.  It's a laid back place and thus a great place just to hang out with friends and just get something to eat without the stress.  They add an automatic gratuity to your bill.  If you don't want to pay it, I believe you just tell them you don't want to pay it or you tell them what you want to pay and they adjust it for you.   Again free ice water - you just help yourself.  Free parking (they stamp your card - the last time I checked - call before to confirm).  With all the above factors considered. Marche is a solid 4.  Dining is more than about the food."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and I really liked the concept. It's marketplace style, which means you get a tray and wander through a series of booth-like stations serving everything from pasta and sandwiches to thai green curry and sushi. They also have several bar stations serving a surprisingly impressive variety of cocktails, beers and wine. They also have fresh juices available.  I had the seafood lunch special which was a warm chickpea salad with salmon and octopus in a tomato sauce. The seafood seemed to be cooked fresh (not within eye-sight like some of the other stations but I had to wait and it came out hot and fresh tasting) and at $9.99 was a generous portion and a great deal.  A fun place with lots of different options, I'll definitely be back again for another lunch!"}
{"text":"Always a favorite, love the place, everything from the waffles to the pizza.   I could just spend the entire visit on the dessert choices.   The only down side they add an 18% surcharge to everything and no one really waits on you."}
{"text":"Mauvais service par les employés aux comptoirs. Nourriture variable, sushis corrects, pâtes chers, propreté passable. Desserts très bons."}
{"text":"The pizzas and salad bar are my favorite."}
{"text":"We found the place, walking by in our way to a nearby restaurant. Fascinated by fancy-looking cakes, we bought some in our way back. Cakes were rich and delicate. ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Marche (formerly Richtree) has always been a decent spot for a quick lunch with friends or colleagues. I love the indoor patio which has plenty of seating for larger groups.  Regarding the food, if you have been to one Marche restaurant you've been to them all. There are always lots of pastas, pizzas, rosti, stir fry and salads to choose from. The quality is pretty good and the dishes are prepared in front of you (although a lot of it is pre-cooked to save time, for obvious reasons).  One thing I do not like about this restaurant is the automatic 12% gratuity which is a little excessive considering it's basically a self-serve restaurant. I'm assuming you can remove this at the cashier if you choose to, but it seems a little bit much to me, and can considerably increase the price of your lunch.  A solid three stars, but really nothing special or out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to! Such a wonderful place for my first time in Toronto! Wish we had a concept like this in the states!"}
{"text":"This place is a miss for me. It combines the worst of both worlds of buffet and ala-carte - mediocre food and high prices.  I had fish and chips, which took a really long time to prepare. During lunch timing is essential, as people are usually there during lunch break.   Fish itself was very average. It came with fries and salad. I'm already not a big fan of salad but these were pretty much just leaves thrown together with no seasoning. I tried using the tartar sauce on it... which didn't really work. I brought two other sauces with me that looked like they could be spicy, but both were not.  The portion was large for one person (although mostly fries and \"salad\"), but I'd have preferred cheaper price and a smaller portion.  One piece fish and chips cost ~$13. Only much later had I started wondering how $13 turned into $17. Since they had no tap on their machines, whole transaction took longer and as I had people waiting for me, I didn't check the amount. Checking the receipt I realized I was charged 12% tip for... no service? Mandatory tip? Is that even legal? This is a place that's designed as a buffet where you wait in line to order, get your food and bring it to the table. i can't justify being charged a mandatory tip for that.  Overall unless you're dragged there for a corporate lunch, I'd skip it."}
{"text":"Best place to go with a group of people, have different stations for variety of foods, deserts, icecreams and smoothies. I love the idea of restaurant."}
{"text":"I used to come to the Marché a lot when I was a kid, usually for a weekend brunch.  I remember it being lots of fun: shopping for your food, watching it being prepared, getting your drinking water from the cool fountain, viisting the cool washrooms with the shoes glued to the floor and boys' names on the stalls.  I recently went to Marché for coffee and desserts and was not impressed.  It didn't seem to have the same fun atmosphere.  The dessert and coffee bar sections have definitely expanded.  Lots of selection.  I had the chaichino in one visit and the white hot chocolate another time.  The chaichino was delicious.  The white hot chocolate is made with real white chocolate chips, but when you get to the bottom of your mug, you're left with chunks of chocolate.  Not appetizing.  There should be a better way to melt the chocolate.  For dessert we wanted to try something different, so we got some apple tart and a pumpkin crème brûlée.  The apple tart was not good at all (we didn't even finish half of it).  The crème brûlée was pretty good, but too rich and sweet.  Thankfully it was a fairly small portion.  I guess I can't really blame Marché for my poor selection of desserts, but I generally love all sweets, so I was surprised.  I could definitely tell it wasn't the same Marché I had been to in my childhood.  The staff weren't overly friendly or helpful.  Some of the food options seemed quite boring compared to what I remember.  Even the shoes that used to be in the women's washroom are gone!  I like that they are open late and the whole concept of helping yourself allows you to control how long your visit is - you could stop in for 5 minutes or you could stay for hours.  I don't like the automatic gratuity, but I understand it simplifies the whole process."}
{"text":"Have not been to this location in a while but have been to the one just north. I was running late and craved some grilled chicken,  took a while to cook but  was cooked very well. I love Marche because you have so much choice and everything seems fresh and very tasty. Only complaint is the price, it ended up being just under $13.  Overall this location looked to be pricy but its been at least 2 years since i visited any Marche."}
{"text":"Marche Movenpick in the Brookfield Place Shopping Center at 181 Bay St, Toronto, ON M5J 2T3, Canada is a like an Italian market, side street of China, and butcher of Spain, with much more, all wrapped into one.  What a cool little place for a Lunch or Dinner.  You grab a debit style card at entrance and walk to any number of appetizer, entree, drink, or dessert stations, rack up your bill on the card given and then pay the one tab at the end.  There is endless offerings in this one little place.  You can really touch on a dozen or so different tastes or styles all in one seating.  The servers too that walk in between the tables to help where they can are all great.  It's just inside the Brookfield Place shopping area, street level, across from the Roots store and Hockey Hall of Fame!  Marche Movenpick at 181 Bay St, Toronto, ON M5J 2T3, Canada, is great if you haven't already been!"}
{"text":"Posted at the entrance was a sign indicating that a 12% gratuity would be automatically added to the bill. If you object to paying this gratuity at a non full service restaurant, you may want to pass on this restaurant. If this is your first time to a Mache Movenpick restaurant, this is a fun dining experience not to be missed. As a tourist, I am always interested in new experiences that I cannot get at home. You will be amazed at the food stations and amount of food on display.  The hostess handed me an unpaid tab card and I went in to select a table to dine at. Make sure you turn the sign over on the table to indicate that this table is now taken. If this is your first time at Marche, you may want to walk around to all the food stations before deciding what to eat at this self serve restaurant. You will drool over the amount of food on display. When you have decided what you want to eat, tell the Marche employee at the food station what you want. They will take your unpaid tab card and charge your order on the card. If your order is made to order, they will tell you how long the wait will be or they will give you a pager to indicate when your order is ready for pick up. Repeat as many times as you can eat lol. When you are ready to leave, take your unpaid tab card to a cashier at the exit. They will scan your card and add a 12% gratuity to the bill total.  I looked forward to eating at Marche as I haven't been here in a long time. My appetizer order was one pound of mussels with tomato sauce. I was given a pager to tell me when my order was ready for pick up. This gave me an opportunity to go sightseeing at all the food stations. I had to stop walking around as the more I walked around the more food I saw and wanted to try eating lol. My mussels were wonderfully prepared. The tomato sauce was not salty or spicy so I was able to drink the broth. A piece of garlic toasted bread was included with this dish.  My main course was rosti and chicken schnitzel. I was told that it would take 6 minutes to prepare this dish. The rosti was delicious with sour cream spread on each bite. The lightly breaded chicken schnitzel was moist. It did not taste oily.  There was no dessert as I was too full. :-(  I enjoyed my meal so I will have to come visit Marche again soon."}
{"text":"This place seemed good in theory but had bad execution.  The overall layout is very confusing and you find yourself wandering around trying to find food and then standing in very long lines.  The food was just okay.  I've definitely had better in mall cafeterias.    The only reason I'm giving in 2 stars is that the building that it is in is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Came here Saturday night after seeing a show at the Sony Centre. Interesting concept. You are given a card when you enter the restaurant. There are lots of different food stations. You order what you'd like and hand the staff your card. After you're done eating you give the cashier your card to pay. There are lots of different options for food. We ordered the potato roasti with cheese and bacon. It was delicious. Cost was around $10. I don't think this is a gourmet restaurant but I would stop by for a quick bite to eat. Prices could be better."}
{"text":"\"Go WIRELESS in our WI-FI Zone. Enjoy the sights, sounds and aroma of an authentic, Mediterranean open-market. Using only the freshest and finest ingredients, all of our dishes are prepared right before your eyes. Featuring over 580 seats, 13 different Food Stations and 6 themed seating areas, at Marche there's something for everyone.\"  Definitely one of the better Marche/Richtree restaurants. A wider selection of food than the Marche at Square One or in Eaton's Centre.  13 stations include: Dessert, Fruit, Juice Bar, Pasta/Pasta, Creperie (dessert), Creperie (Savory Entree), Coffee Bar, Rosti/Paella, Grill, Seafood, Sushi, Salad, Pasta, Wine, etc.  Especially love the fresh raw oysters. Would avoid their grilled porkloin though-completely flavourless, even though seasoned. Sushi can be hit or miss, but prices are reasonable. A lot of unique & fresh dishes. Especially love the grilled eggplant in the salad bar.    Open till late-a definite plus. I believe the hours are as follows:  M-T 7:30am-12:00am /F-S 7:30am to 2:00am S-7:30am to 12:00am   Highly recommended at any time of day. You'll surely find something that appeals you."}
{"text":"I love the concept of the restraunt, using a card to create a tab. It's definitely very unique, the styling is very different too. I've visited many times, and I find that only some items are worth the money. The pizza tastes great, it's baked fresh in a stone oven. The pasta is customizable and is cooked fresh. The desserts are well baked and taste amazing, one of the best qualities of the restraunt, as well as the drinks (smoothies, juice, etc.)"}
{"text":"The good: its a good place for a large group with a lot of different tastes. You know, you're in a group and not everyone can agree? Go here.  That said, as much as the decor and layout are nice, the prices for the food, the quality is a solid \"meh.\" my lamb shank for 15 bucks with some rosti: meat was some of the toughest I've ever eaten and for that price there's much better lamb dishes to be found where its not like chewing leather.   And 3.50 for a bottle of diet coke seems a tad excessive. I didn't buy one because seriously that's just ridiculously expensive.   Would I go back? Unlikely. This was our second visit. Upside it's kid friendly but again, there's better dining to be had for the same cost/amenities.   Bill was 57 bucks for two adults no drinks, just basic entrees. A bit on the high side, honestly."}
{"text":"I do agree with enough of the negative comments that I read here that made me reconsider giving it five out of five stars, for example lining up at the cashiers at the end of your meal to pay and feeling like Walmart looking at all the chewing gum for sale, that kind of thing does drive me crazy. But the rest of this place is really magical, I've been coming here literally for almost 30 years, and I don't think I've had a bad meal yet. Just different degrees of wonderful. The staff sometimes especiallyAt the sushi bar where they barely speak English, they could be a little more patient and less brusque, but so many things about this place enchant me year after year, including it's convenient incredible completely downtown location and inside my favorite building in the whole province the Brookfield place formally called B.C.E. place, and most importantly the unbelievable variety of food. If you have a large group of people and nobody has anything in common with each other, bring them here because everybody will find some food they like --- in fact we loved the food stations so much this is exactly what we did for our wedding, we had about 12 different food stations available, including steak, seafood, pasta, Sushi, stirfry, etc. I love this place! Thank you so much for all the great memories.."}
{"text":"DEAL ALERT:  If you're coming by car, park at the Brookfield parking garage (right next to Marche btwn Yonge/Bay on Wellington).  You can get a $5 off parking on your ticket with a $30 food bill (on weekends and after 6 on weekdays).  They will let you combine multiple receipts whilst paying separately to get to the $30 total.    On the weekends and after 6pm on weekdays, the garage is a flat $10 so after validation, it becomes $5.  They'll charge you the $5 at the register and give you an additional ticket to feed into the garage machine to leave.    Super cheap and you can leave your car in the garage for the rest of the day while shopping around downtown!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Toronto, a must place for me to visit is Marche's. I love their concept of shopping for what you want to eat. Their fun, light, and creative menu selection mixed with its unique restaurant design leaves you at a crossroads. If you are in Toronto and looking for a restaurant that has a little bit of everything, this would be the place to go."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Saturday.   Pros: - Nice ambiance   Cons: - Overpriced  - Food is average"}
{"text":"This place holds a lot of childhood memories for me. I love the way how they have such different dynamics of seating areas. You have your more casual sitting areas to more almost fancier seating areas.   It reminds me of my university cafeteria but for adults. Food is alright, nothing special. They have plenty of stations for a variety of foods including pastas, seafood, grill, desserts, juices and more.   The lasagna I had was alright, nothing special. It did have a ton of cheese though. Also lots of different spices to add to it. The grape fruit juice I had was very good. Had tons of pulp in it. Was freshly squeezed.  Prices are not cheap like a cafeteria since this is on bay st."}
{"text":"Always so fun to go to this specialized buffet style restaurant, where everyone can always get what they want. I've tried just about everything, great salad, shrimp and seafood, chicken, roti, pasta and pizza, Thai noodles, crepes, gelato, muffins, tea, and sushi (yes, great sushi, surprising, right?). Definitely a crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"Food portions are pretty large in size I always end up with a take out box. The food in itself lacks flavour at times but imo still a nice place to enjoy a meal and have some good conversation"}
{"text":"The food always looks better than it tastes, very bland. Trying to please too many and as a result, please none. Trying to be everything for everyone works for MacDonald s but doesn't work for Marche. Then to top it all off, they zap you with a tip for service that never really existed. I like the market concept, but flavorless."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  Huge food selection - so many options! I ate here about five times and must say, the food was very average every time. I tried the salad bar, sandwich / soup, pasta, Sausage / potato , and breakfast combo. All the same - OK but nothing great. Prices are are on the high side for what you get. By the time you get a soda and your meal - you usually spend about $15. I'm ok paying that much if the food is good but not for this place.   I appear to be an outlier in my review - I just don't get why people like this place so much (based on the stars they gave)."}
{"text":"I found its a bit expensive . But they offer a large selection of food. and they charge 18% tip. I recommend just grab some lunch and go to cashier!"}
{"text":"I am addicted to their wood oven pizza!!!!! Try it!"}
{"text":"This place has always been bad -- I decided to give it another go tonight, last time I was here was 10yrs ago. Same, bland tasting food, especially the pasta dishes, $3.49 for a small bottle of Coke? I heard the thin crust pizza was good is the only positive... Au revoir!"}
{"text":"Good place for gathering specially with people pay for your own bill! I come here once a while but this time I feel the quality of food gone down and my friend feel the same too! And the sad thing is I got diarrhea after the meal and it was bad bad bad too! My stomach hurt so bad ! :( Hope the management will look into it. May be next time I only order fully cook food, no salad or steak unless well done which I don't usually eat well done steak! :("}
{"text":"Its a nice idea, but I think the restaurant would function better if the food stations weren't so close together. I've seen people struggle to get through with their kids and strollers, and large bags. The food is pretty good, but you have to keep a mental tally of how much you're spending, otherwise you could over spend quickly.   I don't like that the staff are overly attentive to you, in that they will refresh your water every 5 minutes if they see your glass even partly empty.   The environment is almost like a cafeteria, and sometimes it really is just a good place to hang out and talk with friends."}
{"text":"Hmm... i'm with most other yelpers on this one too... it used to be better. Definitely gone downhill since the re-vamp. That's too bad, 'cause i used to really like this place.  Sure the atmosphere is more airy and open (i love the ceilings in former BCE place, now Brookfield Place). But i thought it was much cozier before. The patio dining section feels exactly like that... a patio. Uncomfy chairs and cramped tables. In the back area it looks a bit nicer.  I also think it's tacky to threaten a customer upon arrival of the $100 fee they charge if you lose the card. Well Helloooo to you too! A smile would be nice. The food: it's ok. Nothing terrible, nothing spectacular. A recently had a small caesar salad which i really liked, and a margarita pizza. I thought the pizza would be much simpler, but it was piled high with onions (which i hate). My fault for not asking i guess. They burnt the crust but the lady was really apologetic saying she'd make me a new one if i wanted to wait. But i was starving, so i ate it. But i did pick off heaps and heaps of onions :P I dunno... just not what it used to be. *sigh*"}
{"text":"Marché... Richtree... Marché again.   The décor has changed throughout the years. The food has mostly remained the same. The same convenient system too (get a card when entering restaurant, walk around, choose food,  charge card and pay when leaving). Unfortunately, the same inconsistent customer service and cooking remain too.   The location is outstandingly convenient for anyone working in the downtown core. The place is a really place to relax, meet friends or spend some time with coworkers.   The concerns I have and what brings this place down is all the inconsistency regarding the cooking of meals and the customer service in general. For example: order a simple pizza (let's say, with two toppings) and you might get one that's too greasy, another that's well done and other that's lightly done. Order a steak and the same happens... Order a rosti and the trend continues... I've been to this place enough times to know that food preparation and consistent quality isn't their forte.   I'd give them a break if at least ALL people working there made an effort to have the very basic when it comes to courtesy and politeness... But sometimes, you'll be in one of the spots waiting to order, with no one around, and then you wait and wait and wait. Call the cook and you'll most likely get a dirty look or a look as if saying that the person is doing ME a favor...   Same goes for some of the hosts or cashiers. Some will greet you nicely while others look like they're slaves and can't even bring a smile or even a salutation...   It's too bad that this kind of stuff happens here. The place, the food choice, the price even, would make this an amazing place. Until they get their act together (and it's been a while) a 3 star rating is pretty generous."}
{"text":"Marché may be a bit expensive for relatively normal food, but I love the concept of 'grocery store meets buffet' and I think it is well-executed in the Brookfield Place location (there is also a smaller Marché near Deloitte - you ought to come visit this one as it's multiple times the size!). I prize the wide selection and appreciate the reasonable wait times - I don't come here to quickly grab food as each prepared item required 5-10 minutes, but it's definitely an option I routinely consider when I have more time to buy my dinner when at work. I've had the cheese pizza ($9.99 - very fair portion), burger combo ($10.99?), dynamite roll ($9.49) and cobb salad ($11.99). None were especially memorable (except the dynamite roll which tasted very fresh), but I had no huge complaints about anything and I thought the service was, for the most part, great. It is also nice that there is plenty of seating if you are looking for a sit-down experience. A great place to come to (with friends / family too!) if you are not quite sure what you'd like to eat, but keep track of what you've been buying as it can be very easy to buy more than you need to due to the vast selection!"}
{"text":"Like many Yelpers I use to come here when I was younger.  I remember the food being a lot better and the attitude of the employees to be much more pleasant.  I thought I would go back and give it a try since it had changed hands again (Movenpick to Richtree to Movenpick) and wanted my daughter and husband to experience this unique dining experience.    When we first arrived it was the typical 'here's your card & even the baby needs one too' greeting.  No 'Welcome to Marche' or anything like that.  Not even a smile from the hostess.  After finding our seat, I noticed that some parents had kiddie bowls and toys which I was told was supplied by the hostess.  So I went to the hostess and asked about getting a bowl for my daughter and in a rude tone she said ' did you read the menu/combo for the kids menu?'  In fact I did since it was posted right by the pasta lane.  She didn't seem to like my answers and didn't even react.  I stood there and looked at her waiting for a response and finally asked if there was a problem with me getting the kids combo.  RELUCTANTLY, she gave me the bowl, toy and swapped the regular meal card for the kiddie one.  Wow, talk about loving your job.  She had a bad attitude.   All the other servers and employees that we came across just did not seem happy and you could feel it through the whole place.  No smiles, no happy thank yous....just robotic, repetitious movement from behind the lines.    Rosti - (used to be my fave there) was oily.  Literally dripping with oil when I picked some up with my fork.  And beware, you will be charged $1.50 for sour cream.  It gets even better!  Upon check out, the kid's meal rings up incorrectly for a full price adult's meal.  The cashier calls over the Manager and let's him know that this has been happening all day and asks why it hasn't been fixed.....he shrugs and says something along the lines of 'there are 3 cards and only 1 adult ate????'  WOW......I can't believe he said that......if he had looked all the 'adult' food was on one card!    So here's what I've noticed:  1.  NO ONE offered to help us find a booster chair. 2.  Hostess hates her job and hates being helpful. 3. Manager doesn't give a darn as to how he manages the restaurant and enjoys being condescending to his customers. 4. Employees there hate their job and hate people. 5.  Need I say more?  Marche, if you're reading this....so many of us used to love your restaurant!   I hope you fix things so that people like us will feel like coming back again."}
{"text":"The Wal*Mart of restaurants. This was not my choice, but my wife said she liked the one she went to in London many, many years ago. Lots of choices but nothing looked appealing. Maybe the dessert. Had the greasy roesti and bratwurst and 30 minutes later I did not feel so well. A giant, crazy cafeteria style mess. What is the purpose of the cook wearing gloves for food prep and then taking your card and plugging away on the register?"}
{"text":"I frequented this place over the course of my summer internship with my colleagues. I love the food,  I love the variety (I mean seriously, the selection is incredible), and I love the seating. When you get there they give you a card that you carry around with you, and you have to give it back (using it to pay for what you ordered or giving it back if you bought nothing) when you're done. That's a bit of an annoying quirk that they have, but it was easy to let it slide when you see the inside of the place - it's absolutely huge! Close to the end of my internship we (me and some of the fellow interns that I worked with) actually sat down to eat (rather than the grab and go routine that we had going) and I had a pizza. I kid you not, it was the largest, most generous portion (and the most delicious tasting personal pizza) that I had seen in a long time. So profound! They let you pick from a mammoth selection of ingredients and you are wanting for nothing there. On my pizza I had shrimp, pineapple, mushrooms, cheese, and bacon (an interesting combination, I know). And the dessert section? Unparalleled and absolutely divine! I can't wait to get back there again with absolutely anybody!"}
{"text":"I don't care what people say, I love Marché and always will. I think it's because I grew up coming here occasionally as a kid with my parents whenever we trekked up to visit the Hockey Hall of Fame from my hometown of Buffalo, NY. Back then, my little brother and I viewed it as the holy grail of food frenzy-dom and a chance for us to get absolutely anything our hearts desired. Belgian waffle with chocolate ice cream, you say? Absolutely. 3-egg omelette with bacon and toast? Coming right up!   Now, I admit it's lost a step or two (or three) since then. I believe threw ownership has flip flopped back and forth from Movenpick to Marche (richtree?) and now back to Marche, I believe.   Today, I view it more as a slightly better than your run of the mill cafeteria. It just doesn't seem as clean as it used to, nor the staff as friendly and accommodating. Perhaps it will rise again."}
{"text":"A fun, neat concept with average tasting food. I used to work nearby and would eat here occasionally because it is quick and convenient. There is nothing special or noteworthy to comment about the food - it is average at best. I see the appeal for larger groups and famillies with young children as there is lots of variety and space to roam. I will admit, the concept and experience is fun. Although every aspect of this restaurant is self serve, expect to pay the same amount as you would at a mid-range sit-down, full service restaurant. The final bill for 2 people (2 entrees and 2 desserts) came out to $65 - this includes the mandatory 12% service charge they add to your bill."}
{"text":"It's essentially a fancy food court compared to the other ones you might see in the PATH. There is staff walking around wiping tables and collecting empty plates and utensils, but they're not wait staff as they don't really ask if you need anything. There's even a kids play section if you're bringing the family along.  If you can't decide on a particular cuisine with your group, Marche's might work for you. It's clean and feels pretty nice to sit around for some conversation.  Honestly, I was more impressed by the system they have designed than the food itself. Upon entry, you are given a meal card, which you can then use to go and purchase a variety of foods, desserts, and drinks with. Each purchase is added to your card, and you are free to use their facilities as long as you like. When you're done, you would pay off the balance and return the card.  In terms of variety, there's quite a few food stations. There's an asian station that offers noodle soups and fried rice. There's a grill station, a pasta station, pizza station, ice cream station, salad station, and a few others.  Prices average $15 for an entree-size dish, and the portion sizes were pretty average to me. I got a teriyaki udon bowl from the asian station and it was just average. Pretty much the same quality (and portion) as I would get from teriyaki experience except twice the price.  At the checkout, they also include 12% tip on the bill, which is a bit strange to me since there really wasn't much service beyond them taking my order and preparing my meal correctly?"}
{"text":"They had next to no options that were vegan without onions and garlic.  They did have some roasted vegetables but they heat them up on the grill right in the same area where they previously were grilling burgers.  You get the yucky flavor of meat.  All of the pastas contain eggs, so that wasn't an option either.  Overall not a very good place if you are a strict vegan.  If not, you might enjoy it as there are a number of food choices."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Came here as a pit stop during the Hockey Hall of Fame museum.  This was a neat concept.    There are several stations throughout this restaurant. Instead of paying at each stall, they give you a card and everything you want to eat, you go to the stall, get what you want and they scan your card.  So at the end of the meal, you bring your card to the registers and pay for what you scanned.  Love it especially since I'm a rather picky eater.  So much healthy options.  We were visiting TO and I loved that there was an option to eat well even when you're vacationing.  I ended up ordering the peppered salmon on a bed of greens.  Fantastically cooked and pretty decent priced.  Oh man, when I come back to TO again, this is definitely a place to eat at again!"}
{"text":"Ate so much I can't even move. The lamp chops were absolutely delicious. The mixed berry smoothie was well made but not too sweet. Couldn't eat it all"}
{"text":"What a find: big open airy dining area and a big open airy market where you get your meal cooked to order.  Nice sized wine and beer area.  Foods like fresh oysters, shrimps, pho, roesi w/ schnitzel, huge tapas area, roast beef,  various kinds of steaks, kabobs ready for you pick and have grilled to perfection.  At Marche', when you walk in , they hand you a small magnetic card with their logo printed on it; as you pick your foods and beverages, they 'swipe' the magnetic card for you. After you have enjoyed your meal, you pay on the way out.  Hundreds of different items to eat or drink.  A wonderful dining experience. We ate here 4 times over 3 days.  A must visit for the budget gourmet."}
{"text":"Depending on who you get to make your food, your experience can be good or horrible.   The girl who makes the pizza is an absolute moron and is very rude. She makes the mistake of not making your pizza even after your 10 minute wait because she forgot to, giving it to the wrong person when does finally make it, making you wait again for 15 minutes only to get another, burned AND wrong pizza all while giving you attitude and being rude. Wtf?!?  Prices are unreasonably high and so is the gratuity that you HAVE TO pay even if your experience is bad. You have to get everything yourself so I don't know what the gratuity is for. You don't even get water or napkins or anything at all."}
{"text":"Confusing .. the place is amazing though, but asking each location if you are particular about what you get is a pain. There should be hosts who can guide customers on the options, and assist if clarity required. I had to opt for a grilled salmon to avoid lack of assistance and confusion. Since I couldn't really sample their real offering, I can't really comment on taste. I must say I make a better grilled salmon at home."}
{"text":"Average food and no table service. we have to pay the gratuity in the bill 12% forcefully.    I can say if you really have to grab a night bite in Downtown, save yourself money and go to somewhere which worth your money.   Only if you think the location is convenient to your hunger and spend time with your buddies at night hours. This place is safe inside the financial building with security all night long but definitely not worths a penny to pay the inclusive gratuity on the service which you wouldn't get .    Pro is their Wi-Fi is free and self serve water are free to customers."}
{"text":"Food court food at restaurant prices! Carry your own bland food from station to station but then pay a compulsory 12% gratuity!  Sure, the staff are friendly and the place looks better than a normal food court but a food court it is. Give me better food and table service and I'll pay a normal 20% tip.   ======  PS. No, this is not a \"Swiss style\" restaurant. It's a fancy, overpriced food court with a compulsory tip hidden until you go to pay."}
{"text":"Great selection of food , so it's a nice place to go with a group of people who have no clue what they want. They have sushi, pasta, steaks, burgers, smoothies, crepes,and etc. Most of the food taste good too.   I often come here for my lunches and sometimes dinner. Since they focus on variety, don't expect to get blown away by any of their food. I've had most of it, it's good enough quality to fill your craving though:)"}
{"text":"Nice idea to have the variety but perhaps do less better. Waited ages to be served at the seafood station, completely ignored. Tried the next station, lamb shank and rosti,   alas it was warm and not hot. Salads and sandwiches look great, had a great cake but more attention needed with service and hot food.  I guess the standard 12% added service charge accounts for the poor service, doesn't matter how they treat you, you can't avoid paying it to get out!  Shame, it has such potential, but money better spent elsewhere, many other options nearby which serve food hot and you're actually shown consideration as a customer. Overall very poor service which is certainly not worth the added 12% shameful."}
{"text":"Was here after I got off work today with a few friends. I like the concept of Marche but could do without the ridiculous prices and mediocre food.  I was really stoked to walk around to see what each station had to offer and even mote excited as I hovered over their pastries section.... But my heart stopped when I got to the pastries section and saw fruit flies flying from pastry to pastry and then basting in the sugar coating. Ew!!!!  So I had their toast beef sandwich which was well contained inside a display case and bug-free. I asked them to grill it for me. Even after they \"grilled\" it for me the sandwich was barely warm. At $8, the sandwich was unimpressive. I also grabbed a cappuccino which was just ok.  My DC 's got the Paella (very stingy on the portions and severely overpriced), and also a pound of mussels, which were a bang for your buck. However the broth was rather bland.  Oh and did I mention that they tack on an automatic 15% gratuity to your bill? Service? What service? I would only come back if the place was suggested but I would not suggest it myself."}
{"text":"This place was so good that two nights later we returned for dinner.   This time my daughter ordered a veggie pizza, my son a half chicken,  my wife a beef kabob and my self a chicken schnitzel.    This evening, just like the other night, the food was excellent."}
{"text":"I wish we have this in the USA.  Fancy buffet and you can get anything you want!  From French crepes, Vietnamese pho, pad Thai, pizza, pasta, salad bar... And the dessert!! Quite reasonably priced but be careful because you pay when you exit so you may keep ordering and eating and at the end rack up a $50 bill like we did.  Free wifi is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Thankful that I was first introduced to Marche in Europe. This market style eatery is exactly what we are missing in the States. The service is great, the numerous ethnic selections at each station and being able to get so up close with your meal preparation is the best part. Nice location and bonus points for staying open late night on weekends."}
{"text":"What I learnt today: Marche does not equal Richtree. Never confuse the two.  I had heard about how the original Marche (the one I frequented often as a kid with my parents and then later in high school) closed down and reopened again, but never read about the entire story  (http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/restaurants/article/756413--m-ouml-venpick-regains-yonge-st-march-eacute)  Basically the original Marche and Movenpick were one company, and then through a slew of lawsuits became Richtree vs Movenpick. Richtree kept their flagship, renamed a bunch of restaurants and opened Richtree express. Then, as the lease expires at BCE place, Movenpick buys back the space, and re-opens the restaurant (with lots of renovation). The original owners of Richtree don't even work there anymore.   It's quite interesting that if you google Marche Restaurant, the first item is Richtree.  But. It is not the same. Sure, they made renovations (more seating, slicker design, rearranged the marketplace, changed the entrance) but it's the same concept. And the confusing parts is that both restaurants look the same, have similiar green and white colour schemes, and serve similar foods, but are incredibly different.   The food here was not just mediocre, but some was down right inedible.  My friend's Banana Cream cake, had the most artificial tasting whipped cream on top, and a sponge cake that tasted like sugar. My Rotisserie Chicken ($8.99 with potatos or veggies) had half uncooked skin that was still PINK (but chicken meat was cooked), and soggy skin - it did not help that I did eat at Richtree last week, and the chicken was delightfully flavourful. I had to put salt on this to make it edible.   The Rosti, the brown half burnt bits were soggy, and the creamed mushrooms tasted like melted butter in heated cream.   The crepe was okay. For $7.99 get crepe with one fruit and sauce. Note, 'fruit' means one small scoop (about 0.5 a cup). If you ask for more she'll give you a few pieces if you're getting one kind of fruit. For another small spoonful of fruit it's $1.99 !!!! This is just robbery, i may as well cut a bucket of my own strawberries. And it's not like she gives you MORE, it's just about the same amount. Anyway, it tasted not bad, nothing spectacular.   The arrangement here is weird. They keep their supplies of salts, oils, flavoured spices underneath the glass panel at the food stall. I understand its for decoration, but I really don't care for it when workers constantly have to come in, bend down and cut through customers to get their supplies. Just put them away.   The wait staff here was non existent. I remember that when you come with your tray, there would be someone there taking it away for you, and bringing you cutlery if you forgot. Then they would take away your empty plate when you went to get more food. None of this happened during the 2 hours we were there. The only reason he cleared our plates was because I put the dirty plates on an empty table. Our plastic lids stayed at our table the whole time!  It wasn't until we were about to leave, I finally saw someone, and he asked \"can I take your plate\" and took only mine, and no one elses (we had a party of 10).  The worst part? At the cash, we all paid 12% of gratuity?!?! For what? For the guy cutting my chicken to chit chat with me?  (In a North American society where gratuity it NOT normally auto added to my bill, I was upset, but anyhoo)  Gone are the unique baskets and bear on a unicycle that rides across a tightrope and the fountain of the little boy peeing to get your water. Instead, mediocre food and a green cow that shows you their udders.  P.S. There's a candy stop as you exit with bowls of hard mints and what not. There's really no need to grab a bag and fill it with candy then block the line from exiting.   For a $22 meal, I think you're better off going to O&B across the street or Vagabondo or any of the restaurants in the St. Lawerence area."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of variety but the service is terrible and the food is mediocre and pricey. They charge a mandatory 12% gratuity, which doesn't sound bad, but the service is not good. Tables not cleared, food not warm enough, and cashier not friendly."}
{"text":"$18.96. That's what my bill says. The only word I can think of is dumbfounded. Dumfounded at how the small amount of food I just consumed came up to $18.96.  I ordered a small pasta. I didn't realise that the size was the equivalent of a kiddies meal. It was bland, no seasoning no flavour. My 12-year-old self made mac and cheese that tasted better and THAT came from a box.  I also figured I'd get a slice of tiramisu. I finished it simply because I paid for it and not because it was good.  Now you're caught up to where I am now, still staring at my bill and wondering why I was charged 12% gratuity to create a grand total of $18.96. It was just me with my kiddie bland pasta & my sh*tty cake. Every time I pass there now, I'll think of all the things I could've bought or the other places I could've eaten at for $18.96."}
{"text":"Very pricey for very mediocre food. Also they automatically add the tips when you checkout even though I didn't get served at all aside from being brought to a table...  I paid $18 for a very mediocre salad that I couldn't even finish. Seriously what a rip off. They make it look nice and presentable but the taste is a 4/10."}
{"text":"This place is like a kitchen for me it's so close by.  I eat here regularly and have eaten almost everything.  While it's not truly exceptional food, it's decent if you know what to get and the variety of different types is pretty good.  Basically the theme is that you walk in and they give you a card.  You use that card at the various stalls to buy food.  Some standouts when it comes to food is the seafood section, the sausages on the grill, the new pho soup section and the dessert section.  I hear the waffles/crepes are good to but usually head over to the dessert section instead.    The dessert section has some low key but satisfying regulars like the \"wahe\" (baked custard with fruit), the napoleon and the pastry with the shredded apple in it with cinnamon (name escapes me for the moment but one of the really good ones) but they rotate some of the dishes regularly.  They also have this great vanilla sauce they put on everything.  They reuse some of their ingredients (custard in one might be custard in another, just baked) but that's ok since they're pretty good.  All in all I give this a 4/5 mainly for the environment and set-up.  Lots of side rooms for events, wonderful atmosphere and decent to good food, depending on the stall.  You leave here feeling like you had a fun time and went somewhere."}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time both as a university student and when I worked nearby.  It was great until they changed the entire place and menu. Before it was like taking a trip to different markets around the world. It was an experience. Now it's like a high end food court. Why change the stuff that kept customers coming back? Now there's nothing special."}
{"text":"I use to go marches a lot in the early 2000s so I know of the good food I use to enjoy but on feb 6 2015 after dinner with the family we were going for dessert that's when we found this cockroach in the pineapple yeah wasn't too thrilled about it you'll thought a fruit fly would be the norm which we did see but a cockroach that's too much what would you do with a cockroach crawling through your pineapple?"}
{"text":"I took friends here on Sunday, I had the white hot chocolate...my friend tasted it and said he thought it should be illegal, yes it is that good! I almost fainted with delight as I watched the white chocolate balls melt in the hot foamy milk. (No I have not taken to writing food porn stories).  Seriously though the desserts are simply wonderful. The food looked ok but it is just that, in my opinion this place is great for coffee. Very family friendly.    All my stars go to the divine hot chocolate."}
{"text":"Marche has had a second redux and in my opinion has become better for it.   I was not a fan of when Richtree took over as the quality of the food declined drastically (so I stopped going).  Now that it's had a redux, I've found the food to be vastly improved (and yes, that means the prices have increased also ... you get what you pay for).  Lunch will run you $10 - $12 rather than the typical $8 at the fast food places. I visit the takeout place in the concourse rather than the main area upstairs since most of my visits are during the lunch rush. Offering fresh, well prepared sandwiches, pasta, soups, salads and combo meals.  Marche's take out has yet to disappoint.  The muffins are freshly  baked each day and are by far the best that can be found in the PATH.   Love, love, love the spatzle, rosti, sandwiches and soups.  (Oh and the coffee is great!) Continuing on the industry trend for more 'gourmet' fast food, Marche is a sure bet anytime for a high quality lunch."}
{"text":"I find it surprising Marche isn't rated higher. I've been here for all meals so here is my breakdown:  Breakfast - Crepes, sweet or savory are awesome. They make crepes really well and they are never too thick. They do fill them really full and make them a bit too good so I have a hard time saving some for later.   Coffee is also really good here. Even a regular brew is prepared americano style so you get a nice crema on top :)  Lunch and supper there are lots of pizzas, pastas, salads, etc. at the back there is Vietnamese (haven't tried yet) but my fav station is the seafood. The Bouillabaisse is incredible. Probably my favourite dish here. Also as an appy I like to share muscles.  There is really something for everyone here - pizza, pasta, crepes, seafood, Asian, bakery, salad bar, fresh juice, cafe. Very family friendly. There are booths and big tables throughout."}
{"text":"This is the kind of restaurant that nightmares are made of. Our hotel concierge sent us here for breakfast, an offense for which she will never be forgiven. After searching for the entrance for about 15 minutes, we finally found it inside the mall. We were greeted by a sign stating that a 12% gratuity would be added to our bill, and a woman handing us little debit cards to buy our food with. The selections are meagre and unappealing, and the whole place has a sheen of poor sanitary practices. I saw the omelette woman pick her nose. The bus boys emit a strong European-style odor from their sweaty uniforms. Someone yelled at me in a language I couldn't identify. Nothing here is particularly good or particularly clean. Hand sanitizing stations are scattered around this beehive of a place, but they only serve to make it seem less clean. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"I've been here many many times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The food is here is not bad, but it's not amazing - it's decent for those late office nights and a quick breakfast/lunch. Their pasta selection is quite limited but it's okay in my opinion - there isn't much customization you can do but at least the quality is consistent. I also really like their chicken (1/4 or 1/2) but sometimes their chicken can be too dried so I always make sure to get gravy on top of the chicken to balance that out. Their drinks and desserts are good too - this is definitely somewhere where I would go with my friends to grab a nice lunch/dinner with a plethora of options.   I also really like their basement location in Brookfield's - I often go there during the rush hours in the morning to grab a quick breakfast (usually the scrambled eggs, bacons, and sausages)."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost 20 years and it's been consistently great. It's a beautiful place to sit--I sometimes come downtown early for a later engagement, grab a bite and a drink, and sit on their indoor patio in the galleria working on my laptop, it's quiet enough during the day to get some work done, and it's a beautiful space.  The food is great, there's such a variety. I almost exclusively have their Swiss Roesti - occasionally it's undercooked or burnt, but it's usually delicious. The caesar salad is also great. Great pizzas, and AMAZING desserts--their Napoleon (with bananas in the custard--yum!) is to die for. Amazing coffee and tea, and it's a little thing but their fountain drink machine at the bar makes a very nicely mixed coke, and they have nice glass bottled pops too. I've enjoyed a very fine Vodka Martini here in the evenings, too. And they do takeout--I often pick up a couple of Napoleons before hopping on the GO Train, it only takes a couple of minutes to hop in! Amazing breakfast, too. Good any time of day, any level of appetite, even just stop in for a dessert and get going.  Like I said, I've been coming for 20 years. I've definitely been here well over 100 times, probably somewhere in the 200-250 neighbourhood, monthly-ish. It's such a convenient place to eat downtown. Are there better restaurants in Toronto? Absolutely. But it's decently priced, insanely convenient right next to Union, open long hours every day including many holidays, does dine in and take out, and the food is great with a huge variety plus great desserts. I don't know what I'd do without my Marché!"}
{"text":"Good, but extremely overpriced food. You can find all kinds of food here, Italian, Vegetarian, Sushi, Chinese, bakery, Pizza and others."}
{"text":"I haven't been here over 10 yrs now. The place look almost the same. We had a waitress that been working only for a week so she really didn't know what she was doing. I went to get some pasta and the cook didn't look happy at all. The food taste pretty good. The house wine was poor and I don't even know what it is. It's a average place to be of you ask me."}
{"text":"Great at what it does. High quality. Fun, creative environment. Get your own food, serve yourself made to order food. Great for tourists. Great desserts. Overpriced, but look at the location and the decor."}
{"text":"I'm always surprised at how busy this place is.  I don't know if it's the name or if it's a tourist draw but the food has been pretty awful both times I've been here.    The latest time I was here was for breakfast.  There weren't too many options so I settled for the \"Big Canadian.\"  This involved a \"choice\" of 6 different breakfast items.  Each item was pre-cooked, including sausages, bacon, scrambled egg, waffles, potatoes, mushrooms and something that resembled tomato halves.  In truth, there was no \"choice.\"  I was given five items, sausages, bacon, scrambled egg, potatoes and mushrooms.  When I asked where the 6th item was, they threw in a waffle piece.  When it was all loaded on to the plate, the food was placed in a pizza oven as it was all clearly cold from having sat out on a counter top.  Still, it was still lukewarm by the time I ate it, 3 minutes later.  All would be forgiven if the food was decent but it was not.  Everything was soaked in oil.  The potatoes were soggy and soft and the eggs were bland.  The waffle was dry and hard.  I also later found out that toast was supposed to be included but I never received any.  I've heard that at other locations, breakfast is made fresh.  Clearly it's not the case here."}
{"text":"First time going to a concept like this! Thought it was pretty cool!! Too many options to choose from and the prices make it even harder! Went as part of a big party so we got to try a whole bunch of items Pasta (chicken with veggies in alfredo), veggie pizza, fried seafood platter, chicken chow mein, marche soup (like a thick minestrone) some of the items are better than others, but not all are equally filling Service is generally good. Nice environment.  Unless you go here enough times to try out the various items, I would suggest going as part of a group to maximize the number of items that you try!"}
{"text":"Pros: Cool concept, fresh ingredients, good service, nicely decorated, friendly/casual atmosphere Cons: Food is mediocre, the price is rediculous"}
{"text":"I don't know how a place can get by serving school cafeteria style food for the prices that they do. Place wasn't friendly, and the food was really mediocre. Won't ever eat here again."}
{"text":"Food was acceptable.I had the chicken breast with mashed potatoes and gravy for 13.99. The chicken was juicy but the flavor was so-so.My husband had a generous serving of the meatlovers crepe for 16.00. It was mediocre when i tasted it.  My biggest gripe is you must pay 12% gratuity for self-serve. The food lay out (mini food court)concept is brilliant with many options in which there is something so everyone but i found it costly and not a good value for the money."}
{"text":"The food is amazing looking and everything in my party tasted great. The selection is overwhelming and you find yourself disappointed you can't try more. You can also become crippled with indecision and find yourself moving from station to station in a manner that would get you pulled out of the TSA line at the airport for a special private questioning. All the selections seem a reasonable value except for salads which are overpriced imho. You should be too full for desert but the bread pudding is amazing!! This is really an awesome concept that really delivers on the quality. Don't come with a bunch of stuff to carry because you choose a seat then grab a tray and walk around to the different stations. It's Canada. Everyone is civilized but you still don't want to leave your stuff lying around unattended. Don't do this in a hurry!!"}
{"text":"If you are look for variety of food at the same place. Here you will find. You can choose among different restaurant inside a huge and well-decorated place. The price and the staff is OK.   Certainly I will come back."}
{"text":"I was in Hogtown last week and have always been a fan of the Marche.  There is always a good selection to choose from with many of the items prepared in front of you.  The food is good and as others have noted, it is an expensive food court atmosphere albeit upscale.  I like it because it is somewhat casual and different than the regular fare in Vancouver."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I really like the concept of there being different stations of food that you get to choose from. I definitely visited the pasta station and got the marinara sauce with ravioli and veggies which I really enjoyed. I also visited the salad bar and got a cesar salad which you can't really screw up (LOL), and a piece of salmon which was pretty gross to be honest--it tasted like bacon. As a pescatarian, the taste and smell of bacon is nauseating. I also didn't know it would be served cold. Needless to say I had a couple bites and unfortunately wasted the rest.  The service from the salad bar wasn't that great either. No smiles, no \"how was your day,\" just \"Marche card please.\"  I wouldn't be opposed to coming back here again because I did enjoy joy the majority of my food, and, like I said, I like the whole marketplace wine and dine idea."}
{"text":"Food is just ok.  Had the Rosti and sausage, a little over $17 tax and tips in.  A bit pricey for sausage and potatoes.  I remember loving the Rosti way back when, there was more to it then just a pile of potatoes.  Nice atmosphere thou, the indoor patio, would go back for that."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times over last year, totally remind me of Richtree, maybe they're related?  Reminiscing from my last visit, kind of we're the last customers arriving. They were closing up in an hour. Lots of food variety, you can get a large portion depending on your server and food choice. Marches set up is kind of like grown up, proper food cafeteria for adults of bay st/downtown core. The decor is nice, dark browns, whites, forest green with yellow lighting. Upon arrival, you get a plastic card, each food item you get, the server will scan the card and after your done eating your meal, you check out and pay for whatever food/s you got.   Some of the food items we got were the steak, 2 side plates of fries, 1 slice of vegetarian pizza, a glass of orange juice and friend got 1 old school bottle of coke. It was so cute. One thing I like about Marche, you can watch them prepare the pizza, meats, fish, pastas etc in front of you, so you know it's fresh and get to pick your slice/cut etc. Same goes for the fruit juices they have available, all freshly squeezed.   I would def come here again and try some of the other options they have, the pasta options looked great."}
{"text":"Am I crazy or did Marche used to have fountains shaped like lions' heads which spouted water from the mouth where you filled your cup with water?   I always get basically the same thing at Marche. I get rosti. And then something with my rosti. This time, it was a bratwurst. All in all, a tasty meal, but quite pricey. Marche has never been cheap though."}
{"text":"I could not do it. Maybe it was the time of day to go but for the price, it is not worth the wait to serve yourself.  I  am to this location because my Wife and I attended a paintnite event here. The drinks were good and beer on tap is alright as well."}
{"text":"Everyone is super nice and the food is pretty good quality. We got our food hot and portions are very filling. The fries were a bit on the fried and dry side... Some were burnt to a crisp. The Columbian chicken breast burger was delicious with the bacon. The sprinkle of ruffles was highly unnecessary, all 2 flakes of it.   I'd recommend here if you're looking for something filling. The price is not bad. Decor and interior are clean and tidy. I like that there are several closed spaces you could go to if you don't like being in the open.   Something I'd recommend is to have staff circulate to clear tables or to help customers. Sometimes the water is empty or there are no more utensils or trays... And there's no one to help out. Otherwise, it's a great place to eat."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go in Toronto. They're open late and on weekends, you can park for a discounted rate in Brookfield place (just ask for a parking validation and pay for parking at the checkout in Marche). The best part about Marche is that it can be a coffee place, a dessert stop, a restaurant, or all of the above. It's perfect if you're in a big group and everyone wants something different.   The dessert selection can sometimes be limited - depending on time of the day - but for a little something sweet, there's always the option of crepes. They do a great job with the grilled entrees and fish, as well as pasta - everything is made in front of your eyes, to order. They're very accommodating of special dietary needs and will do what they can for you. The ingredients they use are very fresh - especially the pasta, which they make on site.   They're starting to expand to include a takeout section with European imported cookies and candies as well as baked goods, which is near the checkouts. I would recommend taking a good walk around before settling on an order on your first visit there. Make sure to check out the prices for things, as there is quite a range. Be sure to account for 13% gratuity on all dine-in orders. If you do have leftovers at the end of your meal, you can always ask for a box to bring them to go. If your bill is more than $15 - which it most likely will be - you can get a stamp card. For 10 stamps ($15 gets you one stamp), you get $15 off your next visit. They also have coffee cards, which are for one free coffee per 20 (I believe).   Marche is beautifully decorated and has great ambiance. Brookfield is worth a walkaround as well. Would definitely recommend a stop at Marche, whether it's for a coffee or juice or for a meal."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of food (way more than Richtree), not busy on the weekend, a convenient location.  While all the above are winning elements, there is a caveat - their kids menu is so so - the pizza was spicy and the chicken fingers were flavourless - not sure I want to dine there with my kids again."}
{"text":"Only want to comment on the food this time because we all know Marche is \"a bit\" overpriced (but heyyy, freshly sourced ingredients, house-made breads and pastas, and self-proclaimed health-conscious, i.e. reasonable-on-seasoning, cooking).  My partner knows I'm a glutton (and also loves me so, presumably), so brought me back takeout pasta, ice cream, and a sweet crepe last night, all of which I've devoured happily between yesterday night and this morning.   Food- close to 5/5. The crepe was large enough for the two of us to share and was filled with mango chunks and a semi-sweet, but still decadent Nutella-like sauce (I don't think it's Nutella since it wasn't that sweet). The fillings were fine, but the crepe itself was FINE. Hot diggity dayum... It was chewy and bouncy (am I allowed to describe food like this? lol) and reminded me so much of Chinese dumpling wrapper dough (unrisen dough essentially), but thicker, more airy, and with a very subtle egg flavor. I would go back to Marche just for a plain crepe - it was that delicious!   The ice cream was pistachio flavored and disappointing. Pistachio bits were way too small and few! I want my nuts in my diet! Freezes up like a rock when I left it overnight in my freezer and by day 2 it was definitely lackluster and very generic. Also too sweet, but who can complain about this last point.   Finally, the pescatarian conchiglie pasta with shrimp, zucchini, and bell peppers in red sauce was AAAMAZING. Huge portion size and heavy despite no cheese or cream added (per my request)... Probably close to or over 1000 calories, just saying. There were a lot shrimp yay. I absolutely loved the pasta though. i really want to believe like a child believes in Santa Claus that the pasta was indeed housemade daily from scratch, then hung to dry on their Marche racks, but can't confirm this beyond commenting on how nice the texture, color, and taste were. I like my pasta firm and chewy at center rather than the equal thickness, floppy, soggy grocery store kind. I also like my pasta to be a bit more on the yellow side, makes it appear more egg-y. Anyways, for a non-Italian place, Marche has its pastas down pat.  Will be back for crepes and pasta."}
{"text":"Rough. There are so many marchés in the path right underneath, but this is the dine-in experience. We came with a table of 7 and when we asked the hostess, she said repeatedly \"well I have a table of 6...\" .....um okay, that's great but I have a bottle of wine and netflix at home, but that ain't gon' help me here, is it. My coworker then said \"well, we have 7.. can you accomodate?\" (there were plenty of seats at this time too) and the hostess went on again and said \"I have a table for 6.. maybe you can sit down and ask the bartender to pull a chair up\" ...and then just stared at us waiting for a response???? first of all, isn't it YOUR job to ask if you can accomodate 7? Why would we go in, sit at a table for 6 and what if they don't give us an extra chair?? Then one of us would just stand??  The food was pretty good, except pricey. They give you a plate and you can stack it on for a set price, which you don't get to know till the end. It's all a mystery game show or something of the sort. I got 2 small plates - one with veggies and one with salad/quinoa. Sweet potatoes were delicious but everything else was pretty plain-ish, it was mediocre food that tasted good in a time of hunger. Oh, those two plates equalled up to $20, which is a pricey lunch for 'meh' food. There was nothing too special about anything there but they did have a bit of everything, so it's a good place to hit up with a group that has different tastes (eg. I only eat plant-based foods, while I sat beside my coworker who had half a chicken and a baked potato on his plate). It accommodates everyone's tastes. Accommodating, unlike the staff there. Oh, and speaking of staff - the ones working behind the grills/food didn't seem too friendly either, which is even more intimidating for first timers trying to find out how the process works.   OH, and 12% gratuity automatically put on your bill even though you serve yourself, you get your own food, you get up to go line up to pay at the registers yourself. Okay?  This place is more flashy than anything. I'm not saying I'd never go again, but idk man.. marché be playin' with our hearts with these prices and attitude."}
{"text":"Full marks to Marche for being a convenient and simple dine-in place with all sorts of decent food options. The only downside is that things are quite pricey here and you pay for gratuities when you're doing most of the service yourself. Otherwise the food is passable and there's something for everyone.   We came here on a Friday night before a concert at the  nearby Sony Centre. The concept here is nice. It's a food market and you just charge everything to your card which you pay out at the end. I can't help but to think it is such a smart way for the business to become even more efficient. You're able to walk in and see whatever table is free or even reserve your table.  There's plenty of options but I ended up trying the smoked salmon crepe, the rosti with chorizo sausage, and some various veggies from the salad bar.  The rosti was a potato fritter, I haven't had this Swiss dish before but it was quite good with the sour creme and I really recommend it with a sausage which is a good compliment to the dish. It's a bit of an oily dish but the quality of everything was good and everything was relatively fresh. The crepe was good too, with plenty of veggies, salmon and a nice mushroom sauce too. I also saw one of my friends having the burger which was a nice medium rare and the fries were really tasty."}
{"text":"I'm sorry my Canadian friends, you're spoiled rotten! Marche / Richtree is one of the reasons I come to visit this wonderful city. I have never had a breakfast ever in my life, like I got at Marche'.   Please guys, come to the U.S., where you'd be fortunate enough to have a decent bagel, never mind a fresh food experience at Marche.   This place is awesome .... all the food is so delicious and so fresh. Wow. I stayed for 5 days in Toronto, and if I ever move to your city, I will eat here 365 days a year for breakfast [ well, I might get a little fat doing that, so ... just on the weekends ]   Fresh, fresh, fresh. Fresh squeezed juice, fresh fruits, fresh chocolate banana muffins, wonderful omelettes, waffles with whipped cream and PURE MAPLE SYRUP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ......... YUMMY! Awesome.   Like I said guys, come to the US and try our breakfast selection. Hardly anything is ever fresh, and no places here serve fresh squeezed juice. This is why 1/2 of our country is overweight. Most, if not all of our food is microwaved processed garbage. If you are ever here in the US, you'll remember reading this review.. you really will, and you'll be praying your fat ass was back in Toronto at Marche's ...  Unreal. Unbelievable. Epic. Terrific."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times now over the past couple of years. It's an open concept self serve eatery. Lots of choices to satisfy any food group.   On the whole quality of food is fine, service is good. My only real negative is the price. On my last visit I had the spicy bean and rice salad with beef as well as a berry smoothie. The total was just shy of $25 including tax and the obligatory 12% tips. Granted you're in the downtown core, etc but for a self serve I find it on the high side   Be very careful if you 'eat with your eyes'. As a self serve you can easily grab enough items to fill your tray of food costing close to $40 for one person."}
{"text":"Juste vraiment trop COOL!  Accessible délicieux! Accessible par Yonge st. Il y a de tout! C'est tres familiale! Comme un marché européen! Sorbets frais, smoothies, bière et vin... Crêpes, poissons, Sushi... Sanwiches, pizza Wow tout y est!! Cafe etc!"}
{"text":"If you're at the Hockey Hall of Fame, this was a perfect place to eat. Lots of choices and loved the options. Great setup and great atmosphere.  The food was decent.  Some of it was great -- the fresh burger and fries was a big hit. But the onion soup was surprisingly unflavorful.  The crepes should've been better, but was ok.  Prices are reasonable but its interesting how Richtree was the original. Having gone there too, the food there seemed to have an edge. This seemed a little more middle of the road. I'd be interested to go back to try some other dishes too.  BTW, the kids meals are a great deal. Good portions for cheaper prices."}
{"text":"Food was great but service and store was complicated. You receive a card but there are many stations and its confusing.  Very pricey for what you get. One dish of pasta ran $20."}
{"text":"Zero stars if I could, simply because the meal I ordered wasn't the meal I was served. Croque Madame with mushrooms and a sunny side up egg? Yes, please! But no -- you get a Croque Monsieur with potatoes.   Because. That's what I gave you.  -- the answer from the lady at the station who just wanted to argue. I finally gave up. She wins. And she took the sign down for both dishes as I walked away.   Food was bland. Service was horrible. Skip this place."}
{"text":"It's near my work - and close to where I used to stay.  It's an okay place to go if you need to meet someone and can't think of a place to connect for coffee or a bite.    The food is okay - its kind of like Supermarket take out food (where it looks good - but missing the taste).  It's a bit bland (the food), even the desserts are missing that certain something in the taste.  I have to agree with the person who wrote  Food court food at restaurant prices! Carry your own bland food from station to station but then pay a compulsory 12% gratuity!  If you are downtown and need to connect with a friend or acquaintance it's a quick no brainer place to meetup and grab a Latte or something. Or if you are with a group of fussy folk that need a bite to eat - it's a place that has something for everyone - but doesn't really have the taste/quality one would expect for the price-point on the food."}
{"text":"All kinds of stuff, overpriced, but gotta love the cafeteria style"}
{"text":"Kind of confusing system- upon entering the restaurant, you receive a card, which you have swiped when you pick up an item of food from a certain station (there are different stations, sorted by kinds of food). It was inconvenient that you only can get a plate from someone behind the counter at a station; it would have been more convenient if you could get plates yourself. It is pay-as you go, so you don't have to pay for your meal until you are finished eating.  The food is fresh, and there's a good variety, however it's overpriced for what it is. But maybe my food was a little too fresh- a muffin I ordered had areas with raw batter. I like baked goods to be soft, but I don't like eating raw batter, ick.   I was with someone else at the time, and they ordered a juice, small cup of fruit, and a muffin. They received the muffin for free, as a person behind the counter offered it to him for waiting too long to get a plate, but even with the free food, came up to $12 for the fruit cup and glass of juice (the $12 included a 12% gratuity).  Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"I have been to Marche a few times over the years. As many other reviewers mentioned the great thing about Marche is the variety which is great if you're going out with a big group (or small) and no one knows what kind of food they want until they see it. The restaurant is essentially like a fancy food court.  They use a card system that everyone gets a expense card which get swiped when you order and you pay at the exit (another convenience if you're going out with a group). I wouldn't call the food extra ordinary good but it is pretty decent for the variety they offer. A favorite station for me is always the Rosti which is i guess a swiss version of hash brown. You can never really go wrong with fried potato. There are also a couple of bars that you can order alcohol. The night we went they were very busy and there was a lot of smoke from different food stations. They offer different sitting areas and rooms with different atmospheres. Overall, i think they are still a pretty unique option for dining.   On a different note, the men's bathroom was very messy and there was no soap or paper towels anywhere. Again maybe because they were really busy that night.   Food: 3/5 Price: 4/5 Service and atmosphere: 3.5/5 Overall: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my most favourite restaurants to dine at. Each year I am downtown for a conference and I always make sure I come here for dinner or lunch... or both.  There's been a few changes since the last time I was here... one being, you're no longer seated by staff but rather left to wander around the market trying to find your own table. I'm not a fan of this.  I am, however, a fan of lamb loin chops and choice of potato for $12.99! Although a tad undercooked for my liking (I reckon a good vet could have brought this poor little lamb back to life), they were flavourful and tender. I also selected a small salad from their salad bar to round out my meal. Everything was delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  The great thing about Marché's is that you can make it as cheap or as expensive as you want. With my lamb and salad, my husband's pasta dish and cappuccino and the automatic 12% gratuity, our meal came out to $45 and change. No more than I would spend at any other restaurant and perhaps even less.  The market atmosphere of Marché's may not appeal to everyone but I find this a fun restaurant to be at and I very much enjoy the ambiance."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant since I enrolled in U of T. My sister introduced me to this place."}
{"text":"The selling point of Marché is really the unique concept of live cooking as well as it's venue at Brookfield place which is definitely a high point. The vast selection and ambiance definitely adds to it.  However - after frequenting Marché twice in the past two months for dinner and comparing these visits to my visit couple of years ago, the food certainly has gone in a wrong direction. My first visit - ordered Rosti and it was extremely greasy, second visit ordered the Seafood soup / platter and the chef made one large order versus two small for two costumers - as a result, the content of the bowl need to be emptied, refill, emptied split again between two bolls, refilled again - literally horrified by how they tried to correct error. The core issue with Marché seems to stem from inexperienced cook / staff which treats this restaurant as a mere fast food joint ?  Marché needs to understand that fresh ingredient, live cooking and ambiance alone are all wasted resources if the cook are improperly trained and seemingly inexperienced / amateur. I'm OK with the price as long as my food is cooked properly. Highly disappointed and will never to return."}
{"text":"Marché has a great indoor patio and atmosphere and the concept is fantastic, however the food is for looks only. It is absolutely beautiful but tastes very blah. Some items are downright gross. The only things I recommend are the coffee/espresso drinks and the beer."}
{"text":"My uncle took my wife and I here after going to Lawarnce Market.   Mache is a nice little place with a variety of food options. My wife is vegetarian and was able to find something which is often hard to do.   When we come back to Ontario we will be sure to stop in Toronto just to go to Marche."}
{"text":"located at Yonge & wellington Marche is an open market restaurant filled with different  choices of foods, fresh ingredients readily prepared for you in an instant. A maze of food stands, filled with aromatc flavors. this place brings any foody to joy!  Since it was breakfast time I had their ALL CANADIAN BREAKFAST, choice of 6 items for $11.99. I ended up having eggs, pemeal ham, grated potatoes, grilled mushrooms, quiche....served with toast!! experience was lovely, and so was the service.  Definitely will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest restaurants everrrr. So sad they closed down some of their locations. My favourite one was on donmils. U can find anything you love. From food to dessert. Their pizza is out of this world and lets not forget their desserts.  U can stand their for hours just thinking of what u gonna order. Hahaah"}
{"text":"If you want overpriced mediocre food then you're in the right place! The food has little to no flavor and the prices are not reflective of the quality of the food you will be consuming. It's not terrible I just don't feel like paying that much money for \"ok\" food. The concept reminds me of a miniature version of the Chelsea market (which I love) in NYC but they definitely failed when it comes to the quality of the food. I don't think I'll be back.  I also wanted to bring up the fact that I got the worse stomach ache and a case of the runs after I left."}
{"text":"I work @ BCE place so this is definetely close whenever I just need something quick to eat and get back to work...Once at the door, the greeter immediately hands you a card so go to the particular station that you want...order the food, give the food handlerer the card, swipe and off you go to enjoy!  It's pretty straight forward here....the dining area is spacious and service is nice and friendly...there is a service charge but I forget how much it actually is..I rarely sit down and eat here...I just buy and leave....if you get take out, there is no service charge...  The food is pretty decent, in terms of size and quality...The Marche takeout is below it where people just grab and go...I believe it's the cheapest breakfast around because 1 scoop of egg is only $1.15...I get that almost everyday and put my sandwich together at work...  This is a place you should come and experience but may not be a place where you're desperate to try...  Btw, Marche restaurants are like gas station stops in Europe. I ran into a few of those when driving to Paris."}
{"text":"An $11.99 sandwich becomes $15.17 when you go to pay. Why? Because they add a mandatory 12.5% service gratuity to the bill. It's a CAFETERIA. What service are we paying for? There are no waiters. Rip off. Never going back."}
{"text":"A great option for the family! Reasonably priced, good food and great options! We can  always find something for everyone. Great location and walking distance to everything in the core!"}
{"text":"This is the best gourmet food court ever!!!   If your ever in Toronto stop by this place and come hungry!!!"}
{"text":"I like Marché... lots of room to eat in a group... the food is ok... but wow... for the cost of eating here you can go to Jump or the many other much better local establishments..."}
{"text":"My family has been coming to this restaurant for at least 25 years. We hadn't been in awhile so we decided to stop in for brunch. The service was so disappointing, it completely ruined our experience. The girl who was cooking my mom's over medium eggs appeared as though she had never fried an egg in her life. She broke both yolks while trying to flip them with an industrial sized spatula, she proceeded to give my mom those eggs even though they were nowhere near what she ordered. My mom also ordered a waffle, so while the eggs were cooking, the girl put the waffle in the oven to keep it warm. She ended up charring the waffle. Once she was done with the failed eggs, she handed my mom a cold waffle and sent her on her way.   Everyone on crepes did a great job. The crepes were great.   I used to dream of going to this restaurant as a kid, but everything and everyone was so disorganized this time that I'm really not sure if I'd go back again.   Giving two stars for the crepes."}
{"text":"Love the concept, the food is mediocre and there is no table service even for drinks."}
{"text":"Marche has a great Parisian concept... your food is made fresh in front of you & you can customize any plate you desire.   Great for breakfast- I recommend the omlettes,  and the freshly squeezed orange juice.  For dinner- the pastas are good & if your a seafood lovers they have amazing fish"}
{"text":"The name of this place changes so much it has my head spinning. It started off as Movenpick. Then it became Richtree. Now it's back to Marche (Movenpick). They got rid of the cool fountain that filled your water glass. They're still there, not operational, mocking you. You now fill your glass from some cistern. Seems they've yanked a lot of the variety. You can still get the rosti. Which is about the only thing worth having here. Everything else is over priced."}
{"text":"I used to live nearby here and I absolutely love this Marche.   We've been here multiple times on Sunday for their special $9.99 steak dinner. For this fixed price, you can choose any cut of beef (ribeye, sirloin, T-bone, etc) you'd like-- it comes with a side of your choice (mashed, fries, baked, veggies) and gravy. I always ask for my steak medium, that way they don't burn it.. Sometimes they do and it leaves a bad taste.  I love their desserts. The Napoleon square is the best!  I highly recommend this place for a comfortable and relaxed family dinner."}
{"text":"This restaurant was so original I have never been to a market themed restaurant before I liked it a lot. I also loved all the options you could Eat japenese, Italian, American, German, french, and English food. Good food but not amazing."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years (the last time I went was probably 2012 but I used to come here a lot as a kid when it was still Richtree) and I don't remember things being so expensive here.  I came here with my mother before a concert and we were commenting about how small the portions are.  There was also something my mom noticed: they increased the dine-in gratuity from 10% to 12%.  In terms of food quality, it was just all right, but we could've probably gotten better quality food elsewhere... We ended up here mostly as a last resort because we were pressed for time."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why so many people come here with the prices and the lack of service.  It's never been a go to and there was a time when it was decent...well...  It's changed names from Marche to Richtree to Movenpick but it's always the same.  Subpar food with subpar service.  Mind you, I don't mind paying a bit more if I'm gonna get good service.  What kind of service?  Like being pleasant, answering questions I may have.  The place was not busy, yet there were many tables that weren't bussed.  That was a turn off right here.  Also very annoying, sections were \"reserved only\".  Wtf?  Only special people get access there?  In this one area that was VIP, they also had water jugs which I presume staff would go fill their glasses?  While the rest of us had to get water from the wall labelled \"tap water\".   Pizza station is unorganized and quite frankly, it's thin crust and because it's so thin...it's burned.  I asked for a bit of sauce, she forgot to make my pizza because she was as she said, by herself.  But when I got my pizza, it was regular sauce and so thin the crust was burnt.  She wasn't really apologetic when I got my pizza.  Was going to get some wings.  Wow, the two filipino guys working there are gems in their own category.  I asked if the wings were marinated, I got a gruff \"NO\".  I'm wondering...what does that mean?  Luckily, the guy making my sausage and rosti said \"it's breaded\".  Sheesh, didn't realize I couldn't ask a question.   When I asked another question, the heavyset dude didn't even bother looking me in the eye.  Wow...  All this while navigating fruit flies.  Yeah, with the prices they charge.  You leave not feeling very good about yourself...  I should have made a longer walk and went to blaze pizza."}
{"text":"If you and your buddies ever have a disagreement on which place to visit for a lunch/dinner, please head down to Marche. That's what I do when my wife and I can't agree on which restaurant to visit. LOL! They have everything here from Asian food,Seafood, Pizza, Pasta, Crepes, Salad, Bakery, Juice, Coffee, Desserts and a Bar. I really like the concept of a market where you can visit any stall and order what you like through your card. The food sometimes can appear a bit expensive coz you are picking and choosing what you want but it's a nice experience. I have seen kids enjoying the variety of options provided. The food is of reasonable taste and won't blow you away. I like Marche because its one of its kind in Toronto and it's neither a buffet or an ala carte. You won't' end up eating too much or ordering a lot. 5 stars just for the concept that I love.! :)"}
{"text":"Not much I can add to what Rainie L. wrote on 11/8/2012.  I like the concept and the food is fresh.  What more can you ask?"}
{"text":"Good place for some moderate food. This location is great if you have a group of people that want different cuisine types. They have a card system so you can enjoy what you want then at the end, checkout with the card and pay the balance with whatever payment method is convenient for you  4.0/5 *"}
{"text":"Worst value for money ever. I prefer to have some meat with veggies for lucnh-but the only combos with meat were with greasy potatos. So I took just vegetables. The medium plate was so small-don't know 3 potatoes would fit in it SO took large for 10.99-decent size for 1 person Food was ok On  the check out they add 12% gratuity-what? nobdoy served me? i picked up my own tray So for $14 got some potatoes and mushrooms. When I told this disappointment to cashier-all she said was \"Welcome to Marche\" hilarious:-)"}
{"text":"Prices are getting high, but food is still good. Don't recommend the sushi though."}
{"text":"definitely a must try as a touristy thing to do. we came on a weekday lunch which was a bad idea because of the lunch rush. with a group of 6 we had a little bit of a wait but worth it in my opinion. though this place can get overwhelming real quick! the idea is you move around the different stations and pick out what you want and with the swipe of your assigned card they charge that item to you which you then use that card at the check out to calculate your total due. different and neat experience. we opted for seafood and the fried calamari was one of the best I've ever had! our entrees were on the days special and couldn't tell you what they were? one was Thai curry and the other cant even spell it but very good. we also had a Cajun shrimp pasta and it was so good too!"}
{"text":"If I could give 7 stars I would! The most delightful dining experience I have had in years. Think fantastic diverse five-star food court. Anything you want made fresh while you wait. Bars, deserts, seafood pasta and the baked goods - oh my. It's like culinary porn!"}
{"text":"I go with family every time I visit downtown, the place is amazing the food and service are awesome and they have different type of foods!"}
{"text":"My fried recommended this place and I was excited to come. Once my host explained how it worked, I was kind of let down. I was SO OVERWHELMED with how things worked and the sheer amount of choices that were available, but then I got the hang of it. It's almost like a cafeteria, but with WAY better food. Instead of sitting and looking at a menu, you can go to different stations literally putting together your perfect meal. I like that. I ended up with the seafood platter: whole broiled squid, cooked prawns, fried calamari, fried shrimp and a seafood gumbo. $24.99. I also picked up a Marchè Soup for $2.99 (half-off soups on Wednesdays). I also grabbed a mozzarella/tomato salad. After dinner I picked up a mixed berry muffin which was stuffed with cream cheese. Incredible. All of my food was very good, the mussels were a bit fishy, but the prawns and shrimp were awesome. I can't wait to come back here to try other combinations!"}
{"text":"I've been dining at Marche for many years, ever since they opened. In the early days, this was THE trendy place to go and the lineups to get in were long. Their concept is still unique in the city and their menu has changed, adapting to market trends. The food is good, with many more hits than misses. They have something to satisfy almost every craving, making this one of my favourite spots to entertain visitors, especially groups.  On my most recent visit, with a group of five from Florida, we were sightseeing downtown on a frigid New Year's Eve and wanted something light to fill the gap until dinner. This is the perfect place. My guests were impressed with the concept and slightly overwhelmed with all the choices. Although tempted to \"sample\" everything, we stuck to lighter fare.  The Caesar Salad, one of my favourite items here since Day One, didn't disappoint. My friends thoroughly enjoyed it. The thin crust pizza was perfectly cooked and the bruschetta was tasty. One of my guests enjoyed a rich vegetable soup.  It was an enjoyable experience for my friends and Marche remains on my list of places to entertain visitors. One thing to be cautious about though, if you eat with your eyes first and give in to temptation, it can easily get quite expensive!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Marché. I really enjoyed the concept of using a card to swipe for your order. There were also a lot of options to choose from although I did think there were a little too many options. The signs were difficult to know what the meal comes up. I ordered the bouillabaisse and it didn't specify what it came with. I should have ordered the large since it was only $2 extra and much larger. Nonetheless it was delicious and I would order it again."}
{"text":"I don't understand why anyone would complain about the price of this healthy restaurant that offers something for everyone. They have a wide selection of fresh, delicious food options, served in a upscale European cafeteria-style restaurant.   The mango puree served with fresh berries was a real treat, and the beef sandwich was served in the most delicious bread I've ever tried. My only regret is that we couldn't buy a few loaves to take home with us."}
{"text":"3 stars to their huge place and attractive ambiance... however the food was mediocre and pricey!  First off we had to stand in the line for about 30 minutes to get into this place. The moment you step in, you will really like the place. As the pictures show, they have made this place to look like a bazaar as the name of the place indicates too.   They have variety of different cuisines, seafood, chicken, meat, asian, foods for vegetarians, wide range of desserts....  I ordered butter turkey rosti! It looked appealing to me therefore I ordered. They prepared it pretty fast, not had to wait a long time for my meal. My fiancé ordered roast beef with mashed potato.  My food was really mediocre in terms of taste. The potato (rosti) was too greasy to the extend I couldn't finish it and the butter turkey was tasteless. The roast beef was not good at all! Looked like a piece of raw meat without any good seasoning, not even looked like roast beef and it was raw! The desserts were tempting but I just got a cup of coffee which was good!  In regards to their pricing, in my opinion the prices are high compared to the quality of food you receive! The service is medium, they never came to our table to ask whether we need anything or not! And they automatically adds gratuity to your bill.  This place is good for groups and people who have kids for a typical day to be spent on a week day... There is nothing really special about this place to convince me to go back again..."}
{"text":"To sum it up, there are only three reasons for coming here: 1) Location - you either work in the financial district or you're downtown for a special event like a sports game or festival 2) Variety - there is a lot of stuff in here, should be able to find something for everyone 3) The experience - just the overall marketplace experience  The restaurant really adopts a \"jack of all trades, master of none\" philosophy. They serve quite a few things here, and you can find something to satisfy almost anyone, from healthy options, to the grill, to pizza, to crepes, dessert, or even Asian food. But yet they don't do anything particularly well -- you can get much better of any of these given items somewhere else (just seldom altogether). Succumb to your appetite, and you can easily end up with a $30-40 bill."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible and not worth your time or money at all. The food is cold, weird, and flavourless, and severely overpriced. Skip it."}
{"text":"Marche Restuarant, I like! Definitely, one of the better eats in the PATH. It is very colourful in here, and the food looks appetizer and plentiful.  I ordered the Roesti Ham Egg and Brulee for desert. Desert was to die for and the roesti was filling. I was happy and then i left.  + note its extra for sour cream (sometimes its okay to nod no)"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for YEARS! The staff is always very friendly & helpful. They have something for everyone. It's a great place to go with a group of friends. I've taken dates here before but it's more on the causal end. Atmosphere is very unique. There is a LOT going on & to take it. The food has always been fresh. Prices are good for somethings & pricey for others."}
{"text":"2 years ago, while in California, a friend of mine told me about this magical restaurant near King that she went to once that had such a large selection of food. I never knew what she was referring to until this last week when I went here.  And wow, do they have a large selection of things to choose from. The food is OK!   Ironically...I was initially glad that I went here because I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to eat. But then at some point, I kinda wanted to eat too many different things and I could actually get any of those. It's ironic because having too many things to choose from became a problem for me rather than helped =)  One thing I was kinda surprised by though was the price. We went in here because I figured, \"oh, I don't want to spend too much for dinner tonight.\" When I paid at the end of the night, it was more than I was expecting!   The other thing to note is that it seems super busy/crowded. Navigating around is OK, but a little tight."}
{"text":"Cafeteria style restaurant. They give you a card, and you find stuff you like and add it to the card, then you pay at the end. Lots of selection, with fun and healthy choices. The crepe section was really good as well. Plenty of room to move around!"}
{"text":"The place to go when you have a group of people with different tastes. They can simply pick what they want to eat from the abundant choices and all is satisfied. Hooray!   For those that never been here before, this is not a buffet. It's a Swiss style restaurant. Meaning you get a card, walk around and see which food items are calling your name, pick one up or place your order, get the item charged on your card, go back to your table to gobble up the feast, then at the end, when you're on your way out, you pay the tab on your card. Simple right? Just don't set your eyes on everything. Trust me, you won't have the stomach to fit it all in there.   I actually went there last night with my family for a night out. I used to frequent this place a lot when I worked in the area. So I can say I've tried about 70-80% of the items in the restaurant. They do have some new additions / stations that weren't there when I frequented this place before but everything else is still there so that was good. Phew! I was worried they no longer make those delicious strawberry shortcakes....  1. Juice / smoothie bar (pineapple lemonade - interesting twist and delish!) 2. Coffee and Tea bar (Latte is weak. Espresso is not strong enough) 3. Wine station 4. Sushi station 5. Pasta (fresh and baked) station 6. Make your own pizza station 7. Bread station / Sandwhich station (premade) 8. Veggie station 9. Soup station (4 varieties -  never knew this but there's a price difference between their meat and meatless soups) 10. Savoury crepes station (it's fun to see them make it infront of you. You choose a meat, then they load it with cheese, and field greens. We got the smoked salmon one and it was a winner) 11. Sweet crepe and waffle station, along with the gelato / ice cream bar (only about 6 selections but they tasted really fresh 12. Grill station (the salmon fillet is DELICIOUS. Trust me on this one. It's so tender. I used to eat it everyday. The ribeye and the top sirloin are also really good but beware, ribeye is totally fatty and the oil on the plate might gross you out. This isn't exactly a steakhouse... but if you want meat, their meat is tender and good. The medium rare is more like a medium though) 13. Pho and vermicelli station 14. Fruit station 15. Dessert station (strawberry shortcake and bread pudding are amazing!!!)   I think I covered all the stations. The quality is good and everything is freshly made for the most part. Dinner for five piglets came out to be $160 after taxes. So about $30 per person. Considering the selection and quality, it's a good value.   PS. Their washrooms are really clean and glamorous! Bonus points."}
{"text":"They have various food such as ravioli, pasta, pizza, vegetables, salads, meat and so on. So this restaurant was perfect as we went in a group and indeed everyone took a different food^^ It was a busy time and the staff who had to work faster was friendly. I had had pity on them. Our meals were fresh and tasty. The prices were averaged."}
{"text":"I can't believe the first time I was here was about 25 years ago, as a student who could barely afford an ice cream. Then years of working at King/Bay occasionally grabbing a pizza to go to eat at my desk for lunch. Good times.  We were early for the PSB concert tonight at Sony Centre, so dropped in to kill some time. Yikes the cost for two lattes, a pizza (that wasn't fully eaten, but will make lunch for someone tomorrow...) and an orange juice. Conversely, this ended up scoring us a huge discount on our parking downstairs, so I'd say it evened out.  Atmosphere relaxed. Quick in and out."}
{"text":"Good food though it ends up being pricey as you want to try some of everything.   I would come here again as they have a good beer selection that goes well with the food they offer."}
{"text":"Great variety of fresh food for any lunch time craving you may have, including yummy doughnuts! Although, there's a Jelly doughnut around the corner in this food court so you may wish to grab dessert there after having some yummy focaccia pizza or roast chicken here =)"}
{"text":"Oh Marché.  Back in the 90s you were absolutely fabulous.  You were THE thing.  Now? A memory.  Yelp doesn't even pick you up to throw back at me when I'm looking for somewhere to eat in the vicinity.    I ordered a goulash because I was looking for a quick grab. Everything costs something and the prices don't correlate with what I think would be fair.  The food is just so so.  There's definitely still something here for everyone but it all feels too much like an old play center that's never been updated or upgraded.    The market freshness is now past due. Sorry."}
{"text":"Located inside the Bay Wellington Tower, this restaurant offers a unique way of ordering our food. As the name suggests, this place resembles a marketplace, in which patrons are given a plastic card (resembles a credit card) upon entry, and they browse the restaurant and it's many subsections (e.g. Japanese, Mexican, or Italian, etc.) and order their food. Once you've decided, you can place an order, and the employees at these subsections will swipe your card. At the end of your dining experience, you'll carry the card with you and pay at the register.   I went with somebody, and we both decided in a $16 fish meal which came with salad and rice. Neither of us were full. I'd say the portions need a little work. Furthermore, the flavours were okay at best; it wasn't anything special.    Note: a 15% service charge is automatically included on your bill.  Note: parking underground (Brookfield Place) is a flat $10 after 6pm, and the restaurant will pay $5 of it if your final tab is at least $30. Just show the cashier your parking ticket."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 I would.  I am embarrassed to say that I have been going to this place since I was little.  Each time, I am genuinely disappointed and each time I decided to give it another shot.  Last week was the last straw.  we arrived and sat at the bar for 20 minutes before a cranky bartender strolled by. I asked for a glass of white wine and she took out a measuring cup and poured me, to the line 5oz... the food is never good.  I got the ready to eat salad... we cleared the plates, got our own water... all that and they still charge 12% gratuity... for what?  there are so many better places to go to.  for example, anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"I recall Marché being a great restaurant to eat at back in the day. But Marché has gone down in food quality.   Visited this location at Brookfield Place during lunch with a party of 10 and was seated swiftly. We were given a card but did not get any instructions on what to do with it. So we assumed the card is what we use to pay for our meals. Marché is generally an expensive restaurant but they had daily lunch specials which was nice. Knowing how the restaurant is pretty much self serve, we got up to order our own food and paid for it with our cards. I ordered the chicken thigh with vegetables special ($9.99) that they have on Thursday. The portion was good as you could put whatever you wanted on your plate.   Honestly the food was mediocre, nothing memorable. But what really got me was the service. We had to get our own utensils/cutlery AND we had to get our own water..... And if you wanted other beverages you had to get it yourself. Fine, in that case, I'll expect to pay no tips since there was NO service. But you know what? They charged a 12% gratuity on our bill!!! Ridiculous.   The only good thing about Marché is that they can accommodate large groups of people.   Don't think I'll ever want to go back to a place who serves cafeteria style food with 0 service. Even at a buffet, servers will ask what you want to drink and will bring utensils to you..."}
{"text":"Below Mediocre!  It sounds like a great idea, a variety of different cuisines made fresh in front of you.  Sounds and looks very appetizing. However reality is far from appetizing.  I had the burger which they advertise as 8 oz of top sirloin, it was perhaps the worst burger I have ever tasted, no flavor, the patty broke apart as I bit into it and dry as sand paper. Horrible!   My friend went to the asian food station and got a fried rice dish, he had 3 bites and left the rest. The rice was very dry and stale and there was very little flavor. The desserts were also very bland, although they looked so appealing they lacked flavor.   The really travesty is the cost, you'd expect that they would charge more reasonable prices, however prices were on par with many high end restaurants, for instance my burger/fries/soda were $23.  I think the whopper would have been much better at $6.   I'm sure that the office workers in the area already know this is a lackluster restaurant, but if you're visiting toronto and wind up at Marche, just keep marching on to something better."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Marche in years and couldn't remember why, but it became very clear. Ok, so let's begin with the food. I met friends there for breakfast. The scrambled eggs and hash browns were super greasy and cold. The portion was ridiculously small. I returned it and got my money refunded. The service was no better. We had to go on a scavenger hunt for cutlery as staff insisted it was on our table. When we said it wasn't the staff pointed to another table and walked away. We assumed we were meant to take the cutlery from that table so we did. During our time there I saw one server scratch her head and rub her ungloved hand on her nose before serving someone and at the checkout I had to wait while the person poked around in her mouth with a toothpick before checking me out. To be fair she did hold her other hand in front of her mouth while she did it (?)! Bad service, bad food, what more can I say?"}
{"text":"Go there for the novelty and variety but do not expect great food or even above-mediocre service.  Prices are crazy high as though you are buying an $8 hotdog from a ballpark.  Food is good.  The staff is sullen, snotty and evidently gave up on smiling or any attempt at nicety.  Ask someone to clear your dirty dish so you can get more food and you will be told to wait until the right person gets to you.  This happened to our table twice.  No water service at table.  Get your own from a spigot.  With all that said, if you are visiting Toronto and have not been to a mövenpick restaurant, this is a must-do.  That's the unexpected incongruity of this place.  Horrible service, good (not anything special) food but great variety, fun format and energetic environment.  This is a restaurant with many different stations.  You can choose from one or more themed stations to choose your foods.  You are provided with a card which tracks your selections for payment as you leave.  There are two well-stocked dessert stations, a salad bar, fresh fish and meat stations, hash brown station, Asian station, Italian pasta and pizza station and more.  For the service, I would rate it a 2 star.  You'll see what I mean when you get there.  I am certain that the lack of service and general malaise of the staff is a pay and/or management issue and one that keeps locals from returning regularly.  This keeps the place a novelty restaurant for every great once in a while or for tourists.  Food is 4-star and novelty/atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Decent food; poor service. After being told they were \"too busy\" to make either Croque Madame or Monsieur (both of which WERE on the menu) we settled on a basic crepe, which was pretty good and served with a delicious mushroom sauce. They refused to heat a chocolate croissant for my daughter. This market-like restaurant of many options is visually pleasing and teeming with options, but the service is sub-par."}
{"text":"The best way to explain Marche is that it is the jack of all trades but master of none when it comes to food. The food is done rather quickly (except seafood and at the butcher) by what I believe are fairly inexperienced staff (with the exception of the Sushi station). The best parallel I can draw to Marche is the college cafeteria. As such, I have reviewed each station independently below.  I have gone here more than 30 times for both lunch, dinner, and many times in between, but its not by choice. Granted, if I had a choice I would not go here. Then again, I work upstairs and it is the only place open if I am busy and haven't had a chance to grab dinner by 9pm or for dinner on a weekend. It says it is open to 11pm, but I would caution that most of the stations stop actually serving food at 10:30pm.  I would caution you from ordering fish or steak if you are unprepared for an inordinately long wait time. As well, there is a mandatory 12% gratuity that they slap on if you eat-in at the restaurant (and watch out, they slap it on if you do takeout sometimes too, so make sure you ask if your bill is higher than you thought it was and you are getting takeout).  - REVIEW OF EACH STATION BELOW -  Japanese / Chinese station (4.5/5): The Sushi is generally fairly good and ish-reasonably priced - I spoke with the Sushi chef from before and he used to work at Japango and said the fish was the same as used in Ki (an upscale Japanese bar located in the same building) as they are owned by the same people. If I had a choice, I would rather go to Japango any day of the week compared to Marche's sushi bar though. The Chinese food / Wok station is good as well, the food served here is well made, but at most times a bit too oily. It seems like a consensus among my friends but the Pad Thai here is good value - unless you want to burn money, adding the shrimp option is usually not good value because they give you 2/3 shrimps on average for ~$4. [Actually, the only reason this is a 4.5/5 is because I am comparing it to the rest of the restaurant]  Pizza station (4/5): The pizza here is reasonably priced if you stick with more normal toppings - they use a stone oven to bake the pizza and you have to wait about 10 minutes before the pizza is done.  Sandwich station (4/5): I used to love this reasonably priced station but recently fell out of love with it. They have two options for sandwiches, BBQ chicken and roast beef - I personally find the beef a little flavourless, but the chicken is often great! They used to make great sandwiches (with bread that hurt my mouth because the crust was very thick, but whatever - I can live with that). Now, the meat used is not as fresh - maybe I am just going too close to when they are ready to close down now.  Dessert station (4/5): The dessert is overpriced ($6-$7) but is good and fattening. They sometimes put out new items here and there, but in general the Napolean cake is good and the cookies are really good - but again, overpriced.  Seafood station (3.5/5): The food is better than the Butcher station, but the wait is just as long, if not longer. The fish generally tastes very good and I prefer to get the catch of the day when I get it. I would not recco the fried options.  Crepe station (2.5/5): The crepe station really isn't all that great, but it's not that bad. The savory crepes are OK, with the smoked salmon one being my favorite, and so are the desert crepes. I would say 1 fruit topping is usually enough on the sweet crepes as it already turns it into fruit wrapped by bread.  Butcher station (2/5): I wouldn't get a steak here, I think steak houses are much better and the burgers are nothing to write home about. I don't believe that the cooks here are very experienced when it comes to cooking meat and the wait is very long on average (15-20 minutes)  Juice and smoothie station (2/5): Their juices and smoothies are not made to order. Rather, they keep them on display in the front in uncapped glasses. The smoothies are rather overpriced and you can get a freshly made one that is 2x the size from a proper smoothie place for the same price. I don't know why I still get these - please save your money.  Salad station (na/5): I don't really eat salad so I don't think it is fair to judge.  Rosti station (3/5): The veggies that come with the Rosti are not that great - they are a bit tough. The Rosti itself, the potato part, is quite good - however, the sausage (if you get it with sausage) is not that great.  Oyster station (na/5): I have never tried this station.  Bar (na/5): I have never tried this station."}
{"text":"Good old Marche at Brookfield Place - many nights I have dined here out of need rather than want when I was younger and worked long hours in the building.   This place has a great sense of nostalgia for me with many great memories. The food overall is not extraordinary but it is more than sufficient. The seating is open and comfortable with just the right amount of ambient noise. A wide selection of different food, salads, fruits, and drinks for every preference."}
{"text":"Marche is a terrific place - I love the dining areas (ranging from more formal to very informal) and the HUGE array of foods (Pho, Sushi, Steak, Pizza, Salad Bar, Crepes, Waffles, Seafood, etc). I brought my picky eating mum and dad to Marche and they thoroughly enjoyed themselves - there is something for everyone. However, it isn't cheap."}
{"text":"Food is incredibly expensive for what you are given. I paid about $20 for a bowl of premade ravioli which the \"chef\" put in a pan and scooped in some premade sauce and cooked it for a few minutes. I finished with some carrot cake which was also incredibly overpriced and to my dismay was almost rock hard. It was even the recommendation of the person serving the desserts."}
{"text":"Definitely on the pricey side. You need to have a big budget. And the food quality is just ok. Nothing amazing. It's just easier for a big party of people that way they can get their own food and pay for their own without having to worry about splitting the bill."}
{"text":"In short-  noisy environment, greasy fare, over-priced and a guarantee that your clothes and hair will smell like smokey food for the rest of the day.  Marche, especially this location is not a place (note how I didn't use the word restaurant) to have a nice meal. I have been here many times over the last few years, most occasions for work lunches ranging from groups of 4 to groups of 10+ people. The staff here are sometimes nice but the more normal encounter is that they are frosty and unhelpful. This is not a restaurant and you should not expect any table service even though you will pay a mandatory tip if you dine-in. There is a service charge for dining in (12%) but you don't really get any kind of service at your table at all unless you count clearing your table after you've left.   Variety over quality. I will give them credit for having a good variety of different food stations, however, the food is not made very well. Nothing really stands out in a good way, though I have had several experiences where the food stood out in a bad way. The process of lining up and paying at the end of your meal is very time-consuming when you come anytime near peak lunch hour.  I never come here by choice."}
{"text":"Food was great, had the pasta, really delicious. Food hall style was fun. What was NOT FUN, was diarrhea and food poisoning. I felt super sick very shortly after and don't think I need gory graphic details to say how I will never be coming again."}
{"text":"Uhhhh, napa in my crepes?!  I didn't even want the crepe when I saw what they were throwing into it. I ate it anyway and dutifully paid for it, too.   Richtree did it better, and $2 cheaper as well."}
{"text":"Good idea, poor execution.  Wide variety of foods to choose from which may be advantageous when in groups or suffering from indecision.  Otherwise at the price point, have yourself a more comfortable experience at a regular a la carte restaurant.  To the response from the team at Marche-Thanks for the enlightenment. I do not suppose those that it is customary to just walk away from the service desk without saying so much as excuse me or to not listen to the tailoring of a customer's meal?  Perhaps just an off day for the team at marche..."}
{"text":"Cool concept if you're going for dinner with a bunch of picky friends. They have a seafood, barbecue, salad, pasta and various other food stations. I do think the price is reasonable but they add an automatic 12% gratuity.  One of my faves are their Caesar salad. I think they add some sort of anchovy oil with that and it's super tasty. Not a lot of restaurants will do that in their dressing anymore.   If you're looking for something quick, easy and simple with a restaurant feel, I'd come to Marche. But skip it if you're looking for an intimate dine in experience. It's borderline a fast food environment."}
{"text":"3 stars is exactly right for Marche.  Great for groups, if I were a little kid I would have been super excited. They have so many different options, but it is really hard to decide. The food does look pretty fresh, and it does taste good. It is heavy, and a bit expensive for what you are getting. We ended up getting a smoked salmon roseti and a beef kabob roseti.  The potato was oily, the smoked salmon was good but the beef kabob was more like a sausage of sorts.  It is a typical mall restaurant, over priced and busy.    Cool experience walking around, it should be a flat rate and all you can eat. I bet people would like it more."}
{"text":"Location - Marché Mövenpick Brookfield Place Concourse Level / Path level at Brookfield Place   Take Out only   Your general Marché varieties, good option for lunch or if you on the go. From fruits, sushi, sandwiches, pizzas, and hot plate items. The hot plate buffet is pretty lack luster, I have seen better. Personally I am a big fan of their pizza/flat breads. Usually there's a vegetarian, chicken, and salmon variant available from $4.99 to $6.99. Loaded with fresh toppings, great for lunch. Would recommend adding some of the sauces on the side, such as chipotle.  This particular Marché location is good for lunch and breakfast. Personally recommend getting items that are made hot that day such as the sandwiches or flat breads. Wouldn't really complain about the price, really convenient location."}
{"text":"The food selection is amazing. I love all of the options and the concept. The food is good, but the staff are rude. I don't understand the mandatory 12% gratuity for eating inside. No one takes your order or brings the food to you. It's an excessive amount for a self-service environment."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad time here. I STRONGLY recommend their Rosti's though. Everytime I don't get it...I begin to crave it."}
{"text":"I ended up eating in Marche twice by necessity and because it was close to my hotel. Marche is an expensive food court that offers alcohol beverages, this is the best way I can describe the restaurant. You get a card and whatever you order from the food stations is marked in it. Then you pay at the cashier when you leave. There is no way to check your bill and what you are charged for can be done only after you actually pay so make sure you keep track of what you have selected to eat.   The food varies from good to OK. I would stay away from the Asian section, my vegetable Pad Thai was basic. The salad station is worth attending, at least they will mix for you pretty good Caesar Salad. Pasta and pizza are certainly safe choices, had hearty ravioli with white sauce and a lot of butter, you have to flavour them yourself as you wish, chilly red pepper, fresh herbs are available at the pasta station, so if you know how to cook you may end up with a good dish. The pizza comes with tomato sauce and cheese as standard toppings and you have to choose the rest, fine crust made in oven with my choice of ingredients is guarantee for succes. I really liked the rotisserie options, but one can eat so much. They didn't have some of the beers on tap, which was disappointing as I really like to try local beers when travelling. My only complaint is related to the service charge, which is ridiculous and I'm removing a star for that. I have to determine what tip to leave for a place where I'm bringing food and drinks myself at the table."}
{"text":"They get two stars for the location and the patio, which is in the beautiful architecture of the Brookfield place (formerly BCE place, formerly some other stupid corporation's vanity name, soon corporate yaya name - who cares?).  Otherwise AVOID Marche.  Two big problems:  1- OBLIGATORY and UNANNOUCNED 12% TIP I only noticed this later and became so angry that I have vowed to never come back. How dare they add 12% without even asking for a place where you serve yourself? The high prices should justify their paying their employees $40/hour, but of course they do not even ask you and add 12% tip to your bill (CEO needs a bigger vacation home??). It is frustrating that a restaurant can have FAKE prices. Because their price is obviously stated price (already expensive) + 12% (which they do not give you a choice about and should not even ask in the first place because the prices are expensive and I walk around to get my own food).  2- BLAND food with NO taste Isn't this supposed to be a place with variety and ethnic or international options? Well, actually now they have changed that to serve food court snack food. Why is the food so tasteless??"}
{"text":"We like the different food stations from where you can order pasta, meet or salads. We found this restaurant the first day of our visit in Toronto. But after a few days of exploring the neighborhood and its wonderful restaurants we  realize the Marche is a little over price for a self service restaurant. Be aware that after 6pm they will included a tip in you bill even when no one is around to help you."}
{"text":"2.5*  Extra points goes to the kind man working the dessert station!  Came here after the Prince concert, so it was close to closing time, and he threw in an extra slice of custard cake...for FREE.    The Berry Custard Cake was just alright.  I'm sure that lots of the desserts LOOKED better than they actually were.  Some just looked downright dry.  And I have a feeling that this place only exists due to the sheer location and that not much is opened late, featuring a variety of different kinds of food, and not-that-expensive prices.  So there's a lack of competition here!  London Fog tea was delish...but like ~$5.  So not cheap.  I believe slice of cake was around $6-7.  Used to come here in high school and I remember the food used to be good.  However, now I think it's just mediocre.  Again, looks better than it actually tastes, and you're paying for the atmosphere.  Staff seemed friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend. We got fresh oysters, sushi, cakes, and macarons which amounted to around $40 each. The food tasted gross and it wasn't at all worth the money. The service was decent at every counter except the dessert counter. The ladies were very rude and gave us attitude for no reason. One of them saw a huge piece of food stuck to a plate but proceeded to put my desserts on it. The whole concept of this restaurant is cool but everything in here is a huge disappointment. I wouldn't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Love Marche and have since I went as a kid to their location in Singapore! The problem with Marche is that you walk in and are overwhelmed by the options and the abundance of choice. No worries though because I've written you a handy list of pro tips to enjoy Marche;   1) Avoid office lunch rush hours. If you want to go from 12 - 1:30 then you're committing to a very chaotic experience  2) If you're in an indecisive mood just skip marche for that day (i.e. it took you more than 2 minutes to pick out your outfit in the morning)  3) Try their rosti - it's a classic!  My personal favourite is their green curry but just explore and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Marche has changed a bit over the years and while it's current name and layout seem to have stabilized, the prices have gone up while the quality seems to have gone down. It wasn't too crowded on a Tuesday night around 6:30pm so we were free to browse the entire restaurant. It was kind of hard picking something since everything seemed expensive and not particularly appetizing. I settled on a breakfast crepe which was alright. Nothing really special to note. I will say that the restaurant is a fun experience for the uninitiated and it has a lovely interior and exterior being in the BCE building."}
{"text":"I've been to several marche restaurant. They're just high end food court. Self serve, fancy interior. This Brookfield one have parking below grade."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch before flying back to LAX and contracted food poisoning.  I had the seabass and a small salad and immediatly after I developed severe stomach cramps and diarrhea.  It felt like someone was tearing out my insides with a sharp rusty spoon.  It went on for a full 12hrs including 5 of it spent on a plane and 2 of it going though security and customs at YYZ.  This place needs to be inspected and shut down!   This is my answer to the response posted by the Marche Team.  First, I wanted to educate them on food-borne illness.  Please refer to the below CDC link.  Food Borne Illness is NOTt \"\"believed to occur within 24 hours and not \"immediately after\" as you described.\"\"\"  It varies depending on the bacteria/virus  http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5304a1.htm  This \"unfortunate incident\" was not caused  by anything else I ate that day since I did not eat anything else.   I wish the same illness that I caught at Marche upon the \"Team\"  there so they can feel more \"sympathetic\""}
{"text":"I've been to Marche several times going back more than 10 years.  The location is convenient (on the subway line and walking distance from my home), they have a wide variety of menu items and the venue is quite spacious, with several rooms with more private seating as well as more conspicuous seating areas where you order your food and at the front (indoor entrance) of the venue.  A friend invited me to join her and her daughter for dinner at Marche on Christmas Eve.  I hadn't had a tuna fish sandwich for quite some time so I ordered that.  I like their concept of providing patrons with cards you have scanned with your order(s), then you present the card to a cashier after you finish dining in order to pay.  When I paid for my sandwich, the cost was less than the advertised price - a Holiday deal I guess? A pleasant surprise.  My sandwich was quite tasty and the venue wasn't too crowded nor too noisy.  All in all, a quite pleasant return visit for me."}
{"text":"I met friends for supper at the Marché last night.  It was there in the mid 1990s when we worked nearby (at that time we all worked for the same company and that's when we became friends) ... then it left and was replaced by another restaurant ... and it recently came back.  There are different stations (pasta, pizza, salad, seafood, meat, etc.) and you walk around and take what you want.  You give the person at the stations your card for whatever you take ... it's like a charge card and you pay when you leave.  It's a large restaurant.  We sat on the \"patio\" ... which is actually inside Brookfield Place.  I had a pizza with pepperoni and fresh tomatoes ... it was delicious!  It's what I used to order there almost twenty years ago.  Deb ordered cheese ravioli in a cream sauce with mushrooms. Franca ordered veggie soup and what she said was bruschetta with chicken and asparagus.  They had heated it up for her but she said it could have been hotter. Liz ordered cheese ravioli in a cream sauce with shrimp ... except the shrimp weren't cooked enough so she sent them back.  They cooked her some new ones and these ones weren't cooked enough either.  One complaint ... I had two glasses of wine.  One I got at the bar and the other at a food station.  Same wine but one (the bar) charged me $6.99 and the other charged me $8.99.  I didn't notice 'til I was home.  So check your bill before you play.  Can't wait to go back for pizza!"}
{"text":"It has been a while since we visited downtown Toronto  and we were looking forward to a great dinner. We arrived to a massive confusion at the front and was given two cards by hostess and told to go right in. After selecting our dinner , we sat down to a table and start eating. The same hostess came over and rudely told us we cannot sit there. She said that table is needed for a family of four. I remind her that there were no reservation signs. She insisted we moved.  I did not want to make a scene so we did. I asked to speak to the manager and she said no, he is too busy. We were furious and so was our neighbor beside us. She couldn't believe how we were treated. I finally found the manager. He inform us he will look after our bill and apologized. At the end , he gave us a 20 % discount. REALLY, I felt insulted  that our terrible experience was settled with a $5.20 discount. We vow never to return."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience here last time we visited (young staff that didn't give a damn chattering for an extended period instead of serving guests, mediocre food) so we had not gone back until tonight -\"let's give it one more shot\" we said....  This place gives a bad first impression, the first thing that greets you is a sign about their \"12% automatic gratuity\" added to all bills -what's wrong, you can't pay your staff properly? Just set your prices accordingly and let the customers decide if a do-it-all-yourself restaurant deserves a tip or not.   On a side note, I do wish that people would stop calling this a \"European style restaurant\", I'm from Europe and I'll say this as politely as possible -we wouldn't have this restaurant in Europe.   For this latest visit, we were hoping that the passage of time would have meant that different staff=different experience, but this is still a very poor restaurant.    I ordered the simple burger and fries... it was very, very average. Again, you have to add the toppings yourself (remember, 12% gratuity!) a task which is made a lot more difficult when they don't refill the toppings station... ketchup was empty, 1 limp leaf of lettuce on dish -and so on, you get the idea. Fries were not seasoned in any way.   My partner's food was actually quite tasty, but there is little or no care taken with presentation -they had the Pad Thai, which was basically a pile of beige food on a plate.   The concept of this restaurant means that you pay at the registers as you leave. To complete the feels-like-the-Walmart-checkout vibe, their register area is strewn with \"impulse purchases\" such as gum, candy and so on.  It isn't exactly classy and looks more like Shoppers Drug Mart (no offence intended to SDM) than a downtown dining experience.   \"Fool me once, shame on you... fool me -you can't get fooled again\" (C) George Dubya Bush -I think I finally understand what he was trying to say."}
{"text":"We went to Marche for a team lunch. Marche is a pretty corporate chain of restaurants where all the employees wear uniforms. There are all these food stations where you can get pizza, pasta, hamburger, Asian food, etc.  I arrived late for the team lunch after everybody has already ordered. I ordered the hamburger, but it took 15 minutes to get my food. The hamburger was okay, not much flavor to it. The French fries was pretty good.  Would I go back? I been here several times and the food was okay. Only for a corporate lunch would I go back."}
{"text":"I love the concept and liveliness of Marché, but not so much the food. Under the same family of restaurants as Richtree, Marché's strongest point is the interactive aspect of browsing and huge variety of choice offered.  Upon entry, you're given a card to swipe each time you make a selection. It's the buffet experience, with the buffet-quality food, and with what inevitably adds up to the buffet price...only without the buffet quantity.   The decor is intriguing, with different seating areas scattered in nooks around the central open space, each with it's own flair. They really could be different restaurants mishmashed together. This is a nice aspect for group dinners, where your party can essentially take over an entire area for yourselves. Considering the indestructible crust of the cheese pie I had, group dinners will probably be the only reason I'm coming back here, under social duress."}
{"text":"I thought this place was the shizz upon coming here for dinner once upon a vacation. Here's a place that would do perfectly for those occasions where a restaurant needs to be picked but there are so many different palates within the group namely due to the fact that anything you could practically want is available and comes in station forms. International selection of foods is superb.  Too bad we don't have one of these in the U.S..."}
{"text":"Been here at least once a year or so. I always order the pasta as it's so filling. The small was $ 11.99 (choice of tomato, alfredo or rose) and I also got a veggie bruschetta $2.99.  They included a lot of veggies and chicken. It was great and I was definitely stuffed at the end of the meal. It wasn't the most amazing pasta I've ever had but it was alright. I thought some of the other items were priced a bit high.  Was not that impressed with the dessert selection. Most things looked as though they had been sitting there for a while. I skipped out on dessert.   Will probably be back if we are in the area especially after a Raptors game."}
{"text":"Came here for a late breakfast. The concept was definitely interesting, and I definitely am willing to give it another try - the stuff for dinner and lunch looked delicious. However I got a breakfast (eggs, toast, bacon, etc) from the breakfast area and it was disgustingly over greasy."}
{"text":"A good lunch option in the financial district. This small Marché is in sort of an indoor courtyard in BCE Place, which means you can get some sun through the windowed roof and avoid the dreaded PATH.  The food is decent and reasonably cheap. My brie and vegetable sandwich ($4.99) had plenty of brie and came on a nice olive bread. The fruit danish ($1.89) I had wasn't quite as good, but it was decent. This is a small place and the selection is limited, but they also have soups, salad, and crêpes.  Next time I'm in the area I'll probably eat here again."}
{"text":"Have you people not tasted the Tom Yum soup w/HUGE prawns?  Confused...yes, some stations are a definite pass; however, the Tom Yum is YUMMY!  Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Cool concept in an interesting building, but the food is a little on the pricey side for what it is and the service is truly terrible. That being said I still seem to go there about once a month when I'm working late; perhaps I'm part of the problem."}
{"text":"workers speaking Tagalog to each other while playing on their iPhones equals bad customer service.  the food is poor tasting and expensive.   it's such a nice space. I wish I different restaurant was there."}
{"text":"Here's the thing...if you have a group of people that can't decide on what they want to eat, this place is probably for your group. They have a little bit of everything. The quality seems to be pretty high for everything, but the price is equally, and perhaps even higher than commensurate to the quality.  You can get a ton of stuff here, you get a little bit from different stations. It's a pay as you go type place. The tandoori chicken...didn't taste like...well...anything beyond your standard rotisserie chicken. The salad bar would have been awesome...if they would have allowed me to add some bean sprouts or cucumbers to my caesar salad...unfortunately you aren't allowed to do that, and they'd charge you an extra 4 bucks to do so.  So...if it were 25-30% cheaper I'd say this was a solid 3 star joint, maybe even a 4...but at 20 bucks a head for what amounts to a fancy buffet style joint that warns you as you walk in that losing the card will cost you 100 bucks...  Ok...so...looking at my check...what was the 12% service charge. is that because I used a credit card? None of my other checks had that included..."}
{"text":"Marché is a marketplace with restaurant-quality food, so it's really the best of two worlds. It's fun to explore the market stalls and pick out your dishes, then sit down among the nice decor and enjoy your food. Convenience and fast service are combined with delicious food. The Italian cuisine is especially worth highlighting but there's a huge variety of French, Italian, and German cuisines among others. Eating at Marché is a really cool experience. It's a great place to grab a quick bite or to eat with friends. Be aware that it's constantly busy, though."}
{"text":"I Love Marche...and I love this location in particular BUT I think a lot of it has to do with memories I've had here.    It's good quality and a decent amount of food.  Be careful it can get VERY expensive."}
{"text":"We stopped in to have a quick dinner before seeing a show the other night and had a nice time.   The restaurant is large and has different cooking stations scattered throughout. Grill, seafood, sushi, pizza and pasta stations were just some of the many selections.   The way it works is you get a card from the host/hostess then you go find a table, you turn the sign on the table to notify others that your table is now reserved, then you go decide what to eat. Instead of looking at a menu, you get to walk around looking at different food stations, much like a buffet but more or less everything is made to order with the exception of a few things like roast beef, sandwiches, desserts which are pre-made for you. You tell your order to the person at the desired station and then you give them your card to swipe. At the end of the meal, you bring this card as your way to pay for the meal.   I found the stations to be a bit overwhelming but it was a really fun and different way to dine. The most challenging part for me was signage and prices. A lot of signs just say something like \"shrimp $16.99,\" and for me that's not enough information. Does it come with a side, how is it prepared, is this an entree or appetizer portion? I ended up with the calamari which came with a side salad. I chose this because I saw someone else with it and it looked great. We also had the chicken schnitzel and rosti.   Both meals were good, the prices are a bit disproportionate, the calamari was a massive portion which came with a large salad for only $11.99 while the schnitzel and rosti was a smaller portion of a chicken for $16.99. We also tried the bread pudding which was delicious and a cookie which was a bit dry and forgettable.   Overall this is a fun dining experience and I'd recommend it to a group of people with different tastes or preferences without having to go to a buffet. The restaurant is really interesting and everything is fresh looking and tasting.   No service but people come by to collect dishes/bring boxes for leftovers and they were quite nice. Drinks/cutlery are all self serve."}
{"text":"Nice place to drink and eat with friends. Plus the view of BCE is nice. Food is delicious !"}
{"text":"I was there on a business trip this week.  This is the only \"movenpick\" restaurant in North America.  Just like the ones all over Europe.   Fresh food, presentation style cooking, and really relaxed.  I would be in serious trouble if I worked in the Toronto Financial District.   I eat there every day."}
{"text":"I only ate here because it was near the Hockey Hall of Fame and it looked decent from the outside.  The food isn't bad.  But the price for what you get is a bit outrageous.  The paella I had was decent, but oily.  I expected much better."}
{"text":"Very expensive, but great quality food. Depending on what you decide to purchase, the portions sizes will vary. The fried rice was around $12.99 but was a large portion and delicious! There are many vegan and vegetarian options. The dessert is a little bit pricey, but good quality. A great location for dinner before a concert at the Sony Centre! Almost right across the street."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! They have great food, desserts, freshly squeezed juices. They have food options of all kinds. Highly recommend. :)"}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed lunch at Marche before visiting the Hockey Hall of Fame recently and had excellent things to say about the dishes we received. The lamb shank and steaks were cooked perfectly, very high quality at a quite reasonable price. The lamb shank plate was around $17 and included a large, perfectly seasoned shank with a side of vegetables, which I thought was a fair deal. The restaurant offers a large variety of foods from different regions of the world, all made with local ingredients and prepared in-house, often right when you order them. Their selection of fresh juices and smoothies was refreshing and colorful, appealing to health nuts and non-health nuts alike. The dessert selection was very large as well, though I was too full from my lunch to enjoy anything personally.   I ordered the ravioli with white sauce, which could have been a little thicker and more flavorful, but was not bad. The salad bar was extensive and fresh, which I appreciated. This restaurant was a tad bit pricy, but given the almost limitless variety of foods offered, is a great place to try new foods and drinks. The bill price was cushioned also by the fact that I used an American credit card, and the exchange rate is in my favor. The dining area was tastefully decorated, but a bit crowded. Lots of furniture and people crammed into not a ton of dining space! Nonetheless, Marche is worth a look if you are visiting HHOF and want to get a quick bite in-house."}
{"text":"It has different kind of food to offer like international buffet, just that you pay for whatever you took to your table. A card to record all those is convenience.  Food is so so, not great and not bad either. They are freshly made thou. Dessert is at the lower end, unfortunately.   It is located in the lobby of Brookfield. It's open with high ceiling. This time of the year the lighted Xmas tress makes it romantic. Great for a casual date night.   Price is expensive given that it's like a food court and food isn't great. They also add 12% service charge at the end - with this food court style I don't think they should."}
{"text":"I don't like it at all. Poor service, poor food.   Hail the trumpet as this restaurant is a misery. And full of miserable staff.   This place looks understaffed and the staff is unsurprisingly tired and mean. Customer service is comparable to a fast food joint and you pay premium for it. This place is inexpensive but it's not cheap either.   The food? Substandard. I had the Rosti which was tasteless and the server mean. I asked the \"chef\" which dessert would she recommend and she gave a snotty, tired look and reluctantly answered my question. I got the cheesecake and it's a disaster. Because it's sitting outside in a room temperature, it tasted like a flea market cheesecake.   Plus, the texture was weird.   And wait... here's more. So I wanted to get a decaf tea so I asked the server if they had decaf tea... and amazingly... of course she didn't know what I was talking about.   My experience was bad from start to finish. Oh wait, tip is included in your bill - good or bad.   I would recommend nearby restaurants where food selection may be limited but better. Where staff is attentive.  Give your tip to people who actually love to serve you.   Marche's glory has ended. Sadly."}
{"text":"Maybe if you are just randomly looking for a place to sit down for a snack and chat and want something healthier than Mcd. Otherwise I think it's pretty overpriced for a lot of the selection. I mean it is somewhat fresh but I might as well go to a proper sit down and pay the same for something with more ingredients.   Had this place twice. Tried the steak, side of mushroom, and crepe. Lunch had the pasta and roti. It's ok but meh not good enough for me sorry."}
{"text":"This restaurant has all the food from all the countries!! The music reminds me of back home Cuba. Beautiful latino music. Perfect to cone with friends and family. I recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I really like the concept of the this place. The food was great. Everything was fresh and tasted good. That said nothing was truly outstanding. I didn't leave there going \"Wow that was fantastic I must eat that again.\" They have so many different food stations it's a little disorienting, but it also gives you a chance to try something new each time. I was with a small group and no one had a preference of place or a large budget so this worked out well. We came a couple of times. For those who don't know what they want or the group that can't settle on one place because of that \"one\" person this is a good choice. It's also great for people touring Toronto for the first time. It's smack dab in the middle of down town. You're close to the harbor, baseball, hockey, and the island so its convenient. I will say it was a lot of fun to eat here. We all broke up in every direction and met back at the table comparing plates like we had foraged for rare food in the forest and were showing off our finds. I wish we had a couple of these franchises in the US because they would make eating out after group events so much easier!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a business trip and it's definitely like the Canadian version of a Wegmans or Vapiano. There's so many different ethnic options of food to choose from, and you just order and have a card swiped so you can pay at the end.  I definitely recommend you try the ice cream/gelato for dessert! The maple walnut is to die for!"}
{"text":"The most expensive self-service restaurant in the world. Your plate of entree for more than CAD 12, and you will have to line and bring it to your table, looking at how ridiculous (small and not fabulous at all) it looks like, regretting not to have been to a real restaurant. For the same price, you would have been the king and/or eaten the best food in Toronto... Go elsewhere. Forget this tourist trap. Good point: fresh food. Bad point: almost everything else (a bottle of coke for CAD 3*50 in a self service restaurant! my good!!)  PS: good note for them, their customer relation department and local owners read and take into account the Yelp comments! (and are working on trying making the place better... to be retested?)"}
{"text":"They sell bad coffee for premium price. The chocolate croissant was equally overpriced and bad. There's only one cashier open during the lunch hour in the middle of office worker lunch rush. Two stars for the location and the ambience."}
{"text":"They've changed to the card system which is good...yes, that's how long ago I was here, when they were using paper and stamps to track what you've received. There's a lot of variety, but it's sometimes difficult to know what you can get. What items go with what. Anyway, 2 people cost $30. I guess that was good."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Marche in years.  But I always remembered it being a fun place to eat and the price being very reasonable.  I came with my 2 daughters for lunch right before the Legends Hockey game at ACC. I remember Marché being great in the past. For some weird reason I had such a bad experience this time around. We got there and met up with my aunt.  The place was so hot.  I felt like there was no ventilation.  The smell of the cooking was so overwhelming.  Felt like a sauna and all the food smell was trapped in one area.  For kids they have a kids menu where they can get a main, drink and dessert for $10.  Price is not bad for kids menu.  I got pizza for one of my daughters meal.  I ordered it and the lady told me 10 mins.  No problem,I ordered it and went to get my second daughters meal.  She wanted a pasta but I was told the pasta will not be served until 2 pm and it was only 12 pm! Why would they not serve pasta at lunch and list it as an option on the kids menu?! Anyways so she opted for hamburger and fries.  So I placed they order and got a pager for it. I ordered my food from the seafood stand.  I got the  tilapia and rice and it was $20!!!!! What is going on. So expensive.  I also got a pager for that.  So by now 20 mins passed from The waiting in line and the ordering. I went back to get the pizza to realize the lady didn't make it.  She was making all the other orders.  She saw that I came back and panic and started making the pizza.  She then made me Wait another 10 mins without so much as an apology. I finally got the pizza which was pretty big for a kids meal. So i proceed to go back to the Hamburger place and also found out he didn't even started making it yet. So I cancelled the order. The pizza was good and so was my tilapia however the amount of fish you get it's not worth a $20 dish.  While my girls were eating after it took an hour to get our food one of the hostess came by and advised us that they needed the room for a party and we had to leave. I told the hostess we were still eating and we'll leave when we're done! So rude! By this point I was not very happy and to have someone make me leave after I waited an hour for my food was crazy.  The only reason why Marche received 1 star from me was because the food was not horrible.  However service wise I would never come back and also for that price I would rather go somewhere where they serve you and the food quality is so much better.  I was quite disappointed with my experience at Marché.  It completely ruin my past great experience here.  If you like long line ups, poor service and expensive mediocre food then you should pay Marché a visit. So disappointed:("}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was about 7. I do love it but it's pricey. People have a hard time having to pay tip included in a self serve, cafeteria style, wait in line for food to be cooked for you setting. I personally like it, it is s nice experience but not really a suitable choice for elderly or those who have trouble walking about. With that said prior to their recent renovation a few years ago I would have definitely given this 5 stars. It's beautiful now but it's modern touch makes it a little more sterile then their old artsy Parisian feel around the giant paper mâché tree centring the dining area.  But this place is worth the experience. Great location, great artisan lattes and teas. Prosecco, beers, wines, oysters, sushi, AWESOME creperie, rosti potato stand, lasagna and fresh to order pastas (awesome), awesome juice bar, salad bar, seafood, poultry, steak stands too. There's also stirfrys of various Asian, Malaysian, Thai sauces. Personal pizzas Desserts. Movenpick ice cream bar. The list goes on I'm sure! I would go again if I was in the area and the best part is because there's no server you can kinda stay as long as you like, no waiter rushing you the bill, no pushing you to get dessert or anything. I've stayed for hours with a minimal bill. So that's my take on it! Enjoy the restaurant at whatever pace you like."}
{"text":"So glad that Toronto has a Marche!  I was really bummed after the Marche Movenpick in Montreal had closed down.  I was a huge fan of the place and have missed their Bouillabaise ever since.  Marche gives you such a plentiful amount of seafood, and their tomato-based broth, along with cream is very good.  Surprisingly, because all Marche is, is an upscale cafeteria.  I've also tried the Curry Paella, Sushi, Pizza, Gelato (good), & Fruli (fruit beer).  Marche is a great place to go with a group because there are so many stations that everyone is bound to find something they like.  In general, the food is decent, but not great.  However, I really do like the aforementioned Bouillabaise.  This main Marche (there is also a Marche bakery inside the underground PATH) is conveniently located next to the Hockey Hall of Fame."}
{"text":"There's lots of selection but the fare is very ordinary.  It's good for later at night when other quick eateries are closed or when it's cold and you need to remain in the PATH. It's a food market which you roam with a venue-specific charge card to pay for items.  More touristy value, but can be fun for casual dining."}
{"text":"This place is like an all you can eat buffet, except its not at a set price. You have to pay for every thing you eat here, but the food options seem limitless and the food is delicious!!! They have all types of food to fit all types of eaters from vegetarians to carnivores.  They hand you a card when you walk into the restaurant. The card is used each time you order something from a food station.  It basically keeps track of everything you have ordered so that when you check out after eating, the cashier knows how much to charge you.  If you lose the card, the fee is $100 CAN.  So make sure not to lose the card!  I ordered a small caesar salad which was a very delicious salad! I also ordered a small bowl of food that I filled up with all sorts of veggies.  Again, the food here was delicious.  To round out the dinner, I grabbed a strawberry shortcake for dessert.  IT was absolutely delicious!  I think my dinner ended up being $15-$17--which I thought was expensive. Although this restaurant does not provide any actual service (other than taking your plates and trays away) they automatically charge 12% to the cost of your food as gratuity.  The staff was attentive though in taking away all our trays and plates.  Overall a good place with good food. Make sure to get here early before the rush so that you can find a table to sit at. We arrived around 630pm and the restaurant filled up quickly."}
{"text":"The staff don't seem thrilled to be here. Flies everywhere... in the middle of January... Food selection good but no love in it. Service Gratuity (12%) automatically included but don't expect anyone to bring your food to the table, clear your food or even offer you water.  Mediocre."}
{"text":"Everything really does look better than it tastes. Plus they charge quite a bit, and annoyingly forcibly include a tip when you're checking out. I hate not having a choice about the tip - just encourages mediocrity.  Can I think of anything I really like here? No! Which is sad considering it's round the corner for me and I've come by many times.  Mediocre food, but a good experience hopping from counter to counter, market style."}
{"text":"Imagine fancy IKEA restaurant and you have Marche restaurant.  Here is how it works: 1. Enter and receive a \"payment card\" that tracks your transaction at each food station. 2. Eat the food there at the various sit down areas (each with their own feel and ambience) OR take it to go. Remember that if you sit down to eat, you will be charged a 12% gratuity - small notice is posted at the entrance of this gratuity. 3. Line up at the cash register/pay outs to pay.  4. Hand in your payment card which will have all your transactions and pay for them.  Overall it's a very fun and refreshing concept. The food you get is generally made to order or seems fresh since you get to see it made in front of you. Here are some pros and cons to this idea of Marche (French for market) style restaurant.  Pros: 1. Pick and choose - can be fun to walk around the venue with friends and chat while picking your food 2. Freedom to eat - no waitresses/waiters around to bother you and your party while dining 3. Seat yourself at any of the various tables for different environments  4. No tipping calculation - 12% gratuity (BEFORE TAX) which makes the dining experience a little more consolidated 5. Slow but decent WiFi  Cons: 1. Expensive for some specialty foods - be careful because some foods are disproportionately priced. Always remember to ask the chefs/cooks what the portion size is and what the food item contains. 2. No service yet a 12% gratuity - tip is essentially going towards the good service of the cooks/chefs and the table top cleaners   Very fun experience and would highly recommend any of you reading this to give it a try. Come expecting a light fun dining experience with plenty of opportunities for playful/flirty banter while picking your food and eating it."}
{"text":"During a nice meal with a friend,  our conversation was interrupted when she spotted a roach on her plate!  The bug most probably crawled onto the table from the wall.  The staff was made aware and were quick to kill it,  but not before I snapped a picture!  I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Okay, if you ever want to be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of options you have as to what to eat for lunch, come to Marche. I probably wandered around this place gaping for 10 minutes before deciding on a small salad and some sort of veggie gratin in desperation (I'm not very good at making choices). The gratin was \"enh\", and the salad was, well, salad. I think that a lot of the pre-made wares (e.g. my gratin, the paella that a few of my dining companions had) have the tendency to be soggy, gummy, what-have-you, for sitting around under heat lamps for so long. There are several made-to-order options that are probably better choices. I had a waffle with strawberries and caramel sauce for dessert that was pretty good, though.        I think Marche is a great place to go with groups because there's likely something for everybody. Probably good to make reservations or go before the lunch rush (12-1:30pm), however, because it can get reallllly busy, and maneuvering around all the stations carrying a wooden tray loaded with food is kind of anxiety-inducing and isn't exactly my idea of fun."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and its always okay but not great. The concept of a market is fun and different but if I wanted to eat at a market I would go to Whole Foods. Every time someone asks to go here for lunch I unwillingly agree since its quick and conveniently located.   Food is not bad but its really not good either. The lines are really long and I usually just go to the salad bar because I don't want to wait. (The salad is okay, if I could buy it somewhere in a box and just take it away I probably would.) The grilled entrees are okay because they are made to order but everything else is average at best. After you get your food you have to find a table and its just too much of a process for what its worth.  Its pretty much a fancy cafeteria so I do eat here from time to time with people for something quick but would definitely not go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"This has, and always will be my favorite restaurant. The staff is wonderfully kind and attentive. The food is beyond amazing with an awesome selection. It's quick, since you always go to the station you're craving and they serve it up right in front of you. I've loved this 'lace since I was 5, and I have zero complaints. Keep up the amazing work!"}
{"text":"Definitely a huge variety of food.  Portions are a plus, very generous with the food. Just a quick tidbits:  Bar is stationed at the same place where you can get kids drinks.  Waited for a glass of wine for 10mins as two kids in front of me could not decide if they wanted pop or juice. Which brings me to the wait.  Waited for every thing at least 10-15 mins.  Very understaffed!!  Coffee, Wine & food was spent more in line than actually seated with my party   Clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"Been there once and I have to say that its very different than any restaurant i ve been. You get a card on your way in and then browse the foodstands to place your order (which is credited to your card). great stuff there. the porkchops were the best I ever had (they come with a delicious sauce).  a little bit expensive and I am not sure why the charge gratuity given that its a self service restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with family and friends! I tried the first Marche in Singapore and became a fan of MARCHE. Lively environment and fresh food, you may feel you were in the central market of anywhere like Tokyo, Florence or Geneva."}
{"text":"I loved the concept of this buffet restaurant! For the simple fact that you only pay for what u actually want to eat - not just everything! I love how CLEAN it is in here and the choice of food is very upscale, fresh and presented nicely! My only complaint is maybe they can have a soft drink machine instead of constantly paying for more and more drinks u have and the costs can come down a tad. That's all :)."}
{"text":"Never disappoints!  Marche is a market-style restaurant where upon entering, you are given a plastic card.  The restaurant has different stations such as breakfast, pasta, desserts, etc. and you walk around to the stations and order what you want. Your plastic card is swiped with every order to keep track of what you got. At the end you swipe your card at the checkout and pay the bill. Simple, different and fun!  I came here for a breakfast meeting - perfect location! Located in Brookfield Place, this restaurant is more than spacious with tons of tables (of various sizes and heights) everywhere. It spills out into the courtyard, great for people watching during the morning hustle-n-bustle!  The food was very fresh and piping hot! I had the  Canadian breakfast (you choose four breakfast items - I stuck to the classic eggs, bacon, French toast and hash browns). Had a tea and a scrumptious, warm, gooey (and XL) chocolate chip cookie.   The staff were all very friendly and helpful at each station and checkout.  All in all, for three people having breakfast, the bill was $50 (incl tax and a 12% tip they automatically add). Great price for the quality and amount of food.  I love this place and am a devout customer for life!   If you haven't experienced Marche - you must give it a try!  Way to go, Marche!"}
{"text":"I want to love Marche for its variety and vibrant feel, but the salads that I've picked up here have all been below average. First of all, the plain mesclun greens give rise to a flurry of fruit flies once you pick up the tongs. Besides the fact that I couldn't include plain greens in my salad, the other salad bar options are okay. The pre-mixed salads are all dressed appropriately, and I really liked the variety of grilled vegetables available. I've also had the green smoothie, which came with spinach, melon, and orange, but it had a slightly sour taste that made me hesitant to finish it. Both my visits to Marche have left a lot to desire, and I really hope that they clean up the fruit fly issue before someone gets sick."}
{"text":"Overcharging for food and not being able to see what you are paying for until you have paid and your recipe is printed off.   This restaurant has a lot of changes that need to be made with staff, food quality and the POS process. Very very bad. Overall unhappy with the entire operation and I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice place to sit and chat for couple hours.  Different food stations under same roof.  Pizzas, seafood, sushi, sandwiches, soups, pasta, desserts, coffee, fresh juices... yummy."}
{"text":"It has been more than 17 years since I've last been at a Marche Restaurant. I was there to meet up with a bunch of people and I forgotten how chaotic and disorienting this restaurant was and still is. Being tired and not very hungry, it wasn't a great atmosphere to be at as I was hoping to relax a bit and being served my meal rather than wandering aimlessly around the entire restaurant to find something I was in the mood of having while dealing the hoards of families, tourists and kids doing the same -- I was surprised that no one had their trays of food knocked over from the amount of crazy traffic that goes through here.  The cafeteria-style concept, while still novel after all these years, is not my kind of dining experience. When I first arrived at the restaurant to meet my party somewhere in the back, I was stopped at the entrance where a staff member questioned a wrapped bottle of champagne I brought as a gift -- I said it was a gift and I wasn't planning on opening it. They didn't help me in finding my table or party either, and the greeting was less than warm and welcoming.  Already had my dinner earlier that evening, so I found it hard to find any light plates or appetizers. Most of the dishes are very heavy and pricey for the same mediocre dishes they have been serving for almost 20 years. So, I resorted to a plate of dozen oysters and a glass of wine. The wait to have the oysters chucked was bit long (they should have served larger portions of wine as you wait for your oysters to be ready), and what I had at the end was sloppy shucking where I was constantly picking bits of shell out of my mouth with almost every oyster. Also I noticed that my wine glass was dirty after I had consumed most of the glass and to add insult to injury there was hardly any table service to alert a server of this issue, so I decided to accept the dirty glass (luckily it was only dried food, not lip stains).   Leaving the restaurant is also a bit of a chore too, especially if you are with a large group. You need to leave all at once so they know everyone at the table has paid. Also paying for multiple people adds to the complexity and hassle. I didn't know that there was a 12% automatic gratuity, which for the lack of traditional restaurant service and being a self-serve cafeteria and their food being very overpriced, I find it very disappointing. My bill came to about $55 for a dozen oysters and two glasses of wine, which for what it was grossly overpriced and I could have had much better food/wine, service, cleanliness, atmosphere and experience elsewhere for the same amount.  Yes, this could be a fun place for families with kids, or for tourists who want something a little better than a food court at the Eaton Centre, but is definitely not a place where you can relax, unwind and enjoy a nice meal."}
{"text":"Love the location ..just off Commerce court.Love the concept. They give you a card at the entrance and you put everything on your tab and pay while leaving.  Be careful though..you could lose track of how many times you ve swiped your card already.  Food is great. Very fresh. The presentation is also very good. Can be busy on week days at lunch time. ."}
{"text":"Self serve dining; great for a fast dinner. Somewhat pricey for students, but to be expected for a Bay Street restaurant."}
{"text":"I've eaten here countless times while working late and I have never had a great experience with the food here. It is overpriced and just not delicious. The lattes here are honestly the worst I've ever had in my life. It tasted burnt and bitter. The staff are quite friendly and make your meal in front of you, which is a plus, but the fact that I have to spend $25 for a mediocre main course and juice is ridiculous. I literally only come here because it's the only place that's open and nearby."}
{"text":"Had a rib eye streak food was meh... crepe was good for dessert.. done if the servers signed kinda not all there... Interesting concept but way over priced."}
{"text":"What a great place to not only eat but socialize. Marchè's unique concept will have me coming back for sure. Food quality is top notch and always fresh. I have never really had an issue there before except for today... My issue lays with quality of service. I was at the soft drink station requesting to purchase a beverage when a manager who was on Facebook on her personal cell phone waived me away while rudely walking away. Wow! But don't let that keep you from checking it out I'm sure someone was just having a bad day."}
{"text":"It's a great place to take tourist and have the Marché experience.  You can have all three meals in one spot.  Food is ok depending on what u get but it's a place to go at least once. Its also a little pricey at times"}
{"text":"We had a great quick breakfast here, and I'm a bit surprised that it is not rated higher.  It reminded me of a Whole Foods in the United States, but on steroids. There were a ton of food and drink options all set up as different stations around the business. So many options it was almost overwhelming.  You had your choice of omelets made to order, pastries, bagel sandwiches, noodle bowls, fruit salads, sandwiches, coffee bar, salads, juices, etc. just to name a few.  The system is kind of interesting:  they hand each person a credit card upon entry, and everything you order is recorded on that.  Then you check out by handing your credit card to the cashier, who proceeds to ring everything up.  They add a 12% gratuity to cover the servers who clear your trays, and check to make sure everything is okay.  Both my bagel sandwich with salmon and my soy mocha latte were delicious, and I wish they had these stores in Florida."}
{"text":"Went there with my family. The process for ordering and getting your food is peculiar, inefficient and slow. My son ordered a cheese and tomato pizza which took 25 min to get and was made with a couple of the tomato cores in the slices - yuck.  We also had salads and a sweet crepe which tasted fine but we were all frustrated and ready to get out if there after having to stand there 25 min waiting for the pizza. After some discussion the manager did take the pizza off the ticket.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Sunday and it was packed. There is a 12% gratuity added to your bill for dine in - there's a sign at the entrance. First thought - take out and go eat downstairs in the food court. Second thought - 12% is less than the 15% I normally pay so that's a deal.   Lots of food options and varieties which is great for different taste buds and food preferences. It has more stations than other marches I've been to.   I had the Thai green curry chicken on rice and my family had the pad Thai and fried rice. Quality is good and it's made right in front of you. The wok skills of the chef is quite impressive.  It had the tasted of a true Asian stir fry dish.   The guy at the table next to me had a steak and fried. It looked delicious so I'll get that next time.   Prices are a bit higher for a marketplace but the experience might compensate for that."}
{"text":"Although there is are other Mövenpick restaurants in town, the one that you want to go to is the Marché at BCE place.   While the other restaurants are sit down style, the Marché is much more fun - a bustling marketplace where you can pick and choose your meal from a variety of vendors and watch your meal prepared on the spot.  The Marché offers an endless variety of cuisines to choose from.  The decor is fantastic, and I love the European feel to the place. Be sure to give their bami goreng and rosti potatoes a try."}
{"text":"Brightly lite if you can sit outside the main food area.  There was apparently drink service, but we did not know it until we got our and balanced them to get to the table.    They give you a \"credit card\" to charge your items, and when you check out you are surprised at how much you actually spent.  I like that idea from their point of view, but I was on the wrong side of the cash register for it this time.  Not sure why we paid for gratuity as I had to bus some of our dishes off the table myself.    The place was crowded and noisy and busy.  It was Easter Sunday so nice to be able to go out and get something other than a all you can eat -less than wonderful - buffet."}
{"text":"Just received this message from Marche about their plans to open in the U.S.:  \"We do, in fact, have plans to expand to the States over the next few years, but in the meantime, if you ever find yourself back in Toronto, a piece of U.S. identification will get you and any Americans 20% off your meal.\"  Pretty cool way to build a client base in the U.S., before they move here."}
{"text":"The food is hit or miss. Going with large groups is annoying -- you need to get your own food, and it's usually not ready-to-take - so they give you a pager the size of a 1980s cell phone and make it beep when your food is ready.   When I was there, I was injured and couldn't walk let alone carry my own food. My pager kept ringing as the rest of my party were off on their own adventure retrieving other dishes. The staff kept walking by and telling me to go get my food... I had to explain I couldn't... to 3 different Marche employees (what are these people being paid to do anyway?) My party finally returned from their adventure and they grabbed our steamed tomato-sauce-mussels, which were actually quite succulent. All I can say is... man are those pagers annoying!  Going with a large group is very blah as you feel like everyone is coming and going -- you're never really all there at the same time... on a positive note, it can be fun to try!"}
{"text":"My aunt used to take me and my sisters here when we were kids, and we thought this place was the bomb. To be honest, I don't remember anything about the food but I do remember loving buffets (still do, let's be real) and thinking that Marche was one, which is probably why we liked it so much. When you're a kid, walking around looking at food and receiving it almost right away is usually more exciting than sitting at a table waiting for your meal to arrive.  Anyway, I am no longer a kid (boooo) and recently came back with my aunt because we were in the area. It's like a fancy cafeteria with lots of stations where you order your food and bring it back to your table. The lasagna was decent, nothing special but I enjoyed the sauce. Small portion for the price, though. The smoked salmon crepe was pretty good and came with a side salad and a sauce container of cream of mushroom soup. Soup was rich and flavorful but...random. Not sure why it was there. Including the 12% gratuity, our meal cost about $30 total.   Not a place I'd be keen on returning to. But one nice thing is that you don't feel rushed to order and eat, plus the seating area is quite comfy. I suppose it's a novel concept and the food is alright, but for the prices they're charging, I'd rather go somewhere with table service."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of this, but he prices have gone up in recent years. The rösti with chicken schnitzel is my favourite."}
{"text":"Marche's concept is really great...especially for a picky family like ours. Unfortunately this restaurant fails on every other level.  Service is non existent. I didn't encounter a single friendly face in the entire restaurant, with the exception of a nice guy (waiter?) who gave us a to-go container for my daughter's leftover pasta. So what are we paying the mandatory 12% for?  Ambiance is quite nice actually. The restaurant is well designed and decorated, and the little pockets of seating give the place a cozy feel. The biggest problem are the little flies that seem to be everywhere. I was hesitant to eat anything because of them.  Food is straight up terrible.  -- Salad bar is average at best. Sweet potatoes and carrots are good but the rest of it is wilted, overcooked, or both. Basics like avocado or tomatoes are in a separate section for custom made salads and are off limits for regular salad bar goers. I don't get that. -- Mahi was dry and tasteless. Accompanying rice was eerily similar to a pathetic meal I had on Delta Airlines a few weeks ago. -- Pasta is overcooked and bland. I will say the quantity was substantial though. -- Desserts looked sad and old. I didn't even venture to taste the many that our group selected.   Marche is also very expensive. Our party of five people paid a total of $150, which was ridiculous. I could have gone to a proper steakhouse and had a great meal with quality ingredients for that price.  Despite the fact that my 11-year-old loved this place (she loves Souplantation if that tells you anything) I have no plans to ever return."}
{"text":"Love the variety of food to choose from Marche.  Everything from healthy to the not so; and everything from pizza to stir-fried.   I ended up with a roast beef wrap that came with a bowl of vegetable soup.  The wrap was meaty and delicious.  And it was made right in front of me quickly.   Just make sure you don't lose the card given to you.  That's what you use to pay. The environment itself is nice.  There is an area that feels like a patio, and then there are areas inside where you can sit down.  It's nicely decorated like a restaurant.  An upscale foodcourt!"}
{"text":"Not a fan like!! Like many of the Yelpers, I went there a few times. It just keeps getting worse but more expensive.....  From the looks of it, there are a lot of options and lots of seating, it's all a façade. The food isnt good regardless the option (can you imagine it sucks so bad even the salad tastes funny!!). The place appears big but there seems to have a perpetual lineup on the weekends. Service, if you manage to get any, is ok at best (not worth 12% of your meal that's for sure).   Coffee's ok but you can get it downstairs at the express counter on week days - faster and cheaper service."}
{"text":"Marche.  We come here for  Comfort food of rosti potatoes Stuffed chicken Veal sausage and great americano style coffee.  Great burgers, steaks and side dishes Desserts are plentiful and eye catching.   Friendly staff eager to please and help.   Great at answering product questions on dry goods.  (Bottled olive oil)"}
{"text":"I've always loved Marché and it was a great place to catch up with a couple of my cousins. We're free to walk around to decide what we want to eat and then sit down enjoy and chat without anyone bothering us.   The rösti is something that someone always orders. While deciding if I wanted a crepe I noticed that the staff making the crepe wasn't pleased with it and actually threw it out and started fresh. To me, this shows that the staff cares about the quality of your dish and won't just give you something that is less than their standard. The aloha burger was a delight. The slice of pineapple added a touch of sweetness.   The required 12% gratuity does seem a bit high as it's pretty much a self-serve restaurant. There's a loyalty card available at the cashier. Eat there 15 times and receive a $15 meal for free."}
{"text":"My favourite of all times. Satisfied different tastes and never disappoints. I usually go with friends and each of them prefers a different type of food. You get your card from the host/hostess at the entrance, then you make your way between stations (Salads, Italian, Thai, Sushi..etc). I usually go for a salad and a Ravioli. Tried a breakfast once and it was ok.  If you choose to have a taste of their various sweets you won't regret it.  They have a room that can be reserved for special occasions and they would prepare a nice cake as well. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you could get lost on your first visit! Which I think I did. Well, maybe not lost but definitely overwhelmed. Seeing that much food presented so beautifully made decision making very difficult for me. It was either leave hungry, out of not being able to control my culinary eyes to one platter of food, or just dive in and choose something.   Everything has a price. Really, there are prices on each item. It might look like a fancy, glamorous, elaborate all-u-can-eat place, but no. It's NOT one price for everything, rather everything has its own price. Which is a new concept for me being from Colorado where the buffets are on every corner and the people there expect to fill themselves to explosion.   I had the create your own pasta with red sauce and chicken, large bowl (don't ask me why except it was only $1 more, $11). It was huge. I also got a bowl of carrots and a bowl of mushrooms ($2 each). I don't recommend this amount of food to be eaten by one, this is absolutely a two person meal (unless you want to be filled to explosion!).   They presented their food in a way that made you want to eat. Everything from Pho to pasta to seafood. If you have a group of picky people...problem solved, come here! Just don't bring your kids and let them go wild, you'll want to hang them from their toes when you get the bill."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the concept of Marche (maybe because the grocery store is my happy place), but the food was just ok. I ordered a quiche and a soup, both of which seemed prepackaged and not super-fresh, not what I'd expect when I'm paying $15+ for lunch. The atrium location in Brookfield bumps it up a star - I love the idea of eating 'outside' in winter without a heavy coat on."}
{"text":"We have been to Marche (this location) many times and we have always had a good experience. They are obviously very innovative with their various dishes. We love their desserts. Prices are reasonable - except that they wanted to charge $2 extra for a drizzle of Nutella on a crepe that is already priced around $9 ... $2 just for a drizzle! Ambiance is fantastic. We usually don't have to wait too long of at all to get in."}
{"text":"There's variety of foods here. Nice place to meet w/ friends. Food taste great and make it right away in front of your eyes. Fruits and vegetables are served fresh"}
{"text":"I've been here before as a kid when it was called Richtree. Came back here for dinner Saturday night and was surprised the line wasn't as long as a when I last came here (which was a few times and every time the line would stretch way out into the longer part of the building).   The atmosphere was exactly the same; a crowded marketplace.  It's an interesting dining experience though personally I'd rather forgo the hustle and bustle of self serve.  I ordered a beef kabob with baked potato and a roesti (rosti) with schnitzel.  The kabob was well marbled, perfectly seasoned and cooked. Very tasty. My only complaint is that you get one kabob per order so your dish lacks a good main to side ratio. It would have been better to maybe sell the kabobs as a single item at a lower price so if you wanted to eat more kabobs you wouldn't have to buy it with the side. Compared to say, a burger, which is like 2 bucks more, the kabob doesn't seem to be a very good deal at all.  The roesti with schnitzel was amazing. It definitely hit the spot for my greasy food cravings. However, eating this actually made me feel quite guilty. Usually IDGAF about calories, fat content, etc. because I don't gain weight (I'm also in great shape just in case someone thought I was super fat and couldn't get any fatter) no matter how much I eat but after my first bite, I realized the roesti  tasted so good because a giant ladle of melted butter was used to fry it.   Prices seemed quite high for portion size and as well as quality but justifiable by the location of the restaurant. I however, did not appreciate the 12% gratuity automatically added to be bill due to the self serve nature of the establishment (Drinks and napkins too).  Overall, good food at unfair prices. Only go here for the experience or if you don't know what you want to eat. Otherwise, go to other places for the specific food you want (service included)."}
{"text":"Went to the Hall of Fame and stopped here for a few beers.    One star for location.  Beer selection was OK, so maybe a half star for that.  The other half star goes for the bottles of alcohol they have hanging from bungie cords in the bar.  Ya, bungie cords.  Right in front of you.  Kinda cool.  Here's where things get a little dicey.  You can't swing the bottles on bungie cords, that are right in front of you after a couple of beers.  Well, you can, but you get in trouble with the semi-not-so-friendly bar tender.  And not a hard push mind you, just swinging it a little.  And only 3 bottles, not the 10 that were within my reach.  So, in review.....You hang bottles from cords, at a bar, where people are drinking alcohol, but you don't want them touching them.  Safety issue?  Who knows.    I did ask why they were there.  I was told it made it easy to unscrew the cap and poor a drink.  The demonstration ended and.....you guessed it, the bottle was swinging.  I didn't feel like I was in danger either.  Funny part is, someone ordered a drink and the bartender used a bottle from underneath the bar, not the hanging bottle.  So I asked why, turns out the half filled hanging bottles are for show!!  Who knew?!?!    So I subtract 3 stars for bottles on ropes that are right in your face and not being able to play with them.  We ended up going somewhere else for dinner, there was no telling what was waiting for us at our table that we would get yelled at for touching."}
