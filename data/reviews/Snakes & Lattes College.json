{"text":"Super accommodating.  Our group kept getting bigger and they helped us switch and move tables a couple times,  and didn't look like he wanted to murder us when we asked him for separate bills.  (but if you can avoid it,  don't.  It's never not a pain in the ass)  I think the dude's name was Scott that served us."}
{"text":"Generally I've been pretty happy with this place, but just had a pretty awful experience service-wise:  First-off--after being seated it took about 20 minutes for the server to take our order (not a big deal, I know it's a board game caf√© and you don't want to interrupt the patrons, however we weren't yet playing any games).  Second--two members of the party arrive later and order their drinks. Cut to 20 minutes later and nothing has reached the table. Asked the server about this and was told there was a mistake with the computer (aka they didn't put the order through.) Again, both of the above are innocuous and not really that bad of an offense.  Cut to 5 minutes later--told that the drinks we ordered (they're 9$) are sold out. We can get a replacement order from the bar.  The offense occurred when we settled the bill--the \"9$ drinks\" we ordered were put through at 12$, and the server doesn't tell us there's an 18% gratuity already applied, so the 18% suggested gratuity that I payed now amounts to a 36% tip on crap service.  The fun of playing board games with friends is great, but keep an eye out for your bill. It leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth to get ripped off like that."}
{"text":"Walking in the room there was a cool vibe. Tons of board games to choose from and lots of people to meet and have fun with. My friends and I decided to come here for board games and lattes. But the barista went home early on a Saturday night.   So where we're the lattes? Why do you have such a cool menu but can't order half the items from it? Lattes, not available. Drip coffee, not available. Hot chocolate , not available. You aren't giving your customers much to choose from except water, alcohol and food. Yet the name suggests lattes... How come no one in the cafe was able to serve us coffees? Aren't you listed as a cafe? Not even an attempt to accommodate this request.   The hostess looked stressed, our server was not attentive and the lack of customer service was disappointing. I'm torn between writing a good review because the concept of your establishment is different and forward thinking but the staff has to learn a few things about customer service and how to be more attentive to the needs of it's guests.   No one wants to wait 30 mins for a drink order. No one bothered to come around and ask if we wanted something more to drink after our first round. After trying to hunt down our server and settle up with her, the automatic 18% gratuity was the only option available when paying debit. But your service was horrible. Again, not giving your customers many options here.   I'm disappointed in the service and menu options. You've done a great job with the interior, it's new, fresh and modern ,but what keeps customers coming back is customer care and establishing personal relationships with the visitors who frequent your tables and pay for your tips. Be more attentive. Show that you care. Work there because you love it. Again I love the concept but I hope you get all the weak links fixed because I would definitely not want to sit through that again."}
{"text":"Don't ever go on a Friday or you'll be met with a little man in a train hat telling you that you can only wait for your table inside (in 3 degree weather) if you're buying an overpriced game. Fuck you little train man. Passive aggression isn't customer service. Thanks for the 2 and a half hour wait- 30 minutes my ass."}
{"text":"Large, bright, nice staff, they have the Quebec beer Fin du Monde on tap, which is special to me.  I am not going to speak about the board games, they have them, you know them. Good concept."}
{"text":"Checked out the new location, Awesome! The washrooms could be improved, dark and gloomy. And the coffee wasn't as good as I have had in the past. Did something change?  The space is nice and a great way to spend some quality time."}
{"text":"For people who aren't familiar with board game cafes, they charge a flat-fee for entrance! But onwards with the review - this location is definitely my favourite between the two in downtown Toronto! It feels much more spacious, and there's a lot more natural lighting.  They have a huge selection of board games! So there's no worry in this department. Service is also great; waitresses were very patient with our indecisiveness, and recommended us board games with helpful and informative details.   I can't say much about the food since I've only had their tea and sweet potatoes, but I can say that they're not bad :)  Definitely a fun-spirited spot to consider if you're looking for a day/night out with friends!  My board game recommendations! - Resistance (5-10 players, party/spies/bluffing) - Cards Against Humanity (4+ players, party/mature humour) - Catan (3-5 players, strategy/negotiation) - Sheriff (3-5 players, bluffing/cards/party) - Bang (4-7 players, party/bluffing/cards/western)"}
{"text":"Amazing food with a great atmosphere.  We stayed 5 hours and played various games. The selection of games was large. The only reason I gave a 4 star is the cover of $5 per person. I understand if someone buys a coffee and stays and plays all day. However for those that spend a lot of money the cover should be waived. This is in no way taking away from how great the place was."}
{"text":"Still by far the best board game cafe in town. Their game collection is second to none, and they provide a decent variety of food for the duration of your stay. I especially like their hot chocolates for the cold winter days you just want to stay in and play.  Service at Snakes is pretty decent for general questions and ordering food. However if the place is PACKED, expect to wait slightly longer for some of the more advance game gurus to teach you an obscure game.  Just a small warning that this place can get HOT. Even on the coldest winter day, you'll start sweating if you're there for some time. Other than that, come here, try some new games, stay the day, you won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled across this place thinking it was a bookstore. We were pleasantly surprised that it was not. We walked in and asked for a table for 2 and got sat right away, on a Saturday at 9pm.   We ordered some drinks and asked for a \"game guru\" to recommend some games he thought would be fun for just two. The guru brought over 4 games and explained to us each game and took the time to teach us how to play it, which I appreciated (I hate reading instructions...).  We stayed until around12:30am and had a really fun time. We paid $5 per person plus the cost of drinks and some baked goods we ordered. We will definitely be checking this place out on our next trip to Toronto.  Also, they have free wifi, which is great for anyone from outside the country."}
{"text":"So much fun! I could have stayed there all day. I thought the $5 playing fee was more than reasonable. Lots of space and games to choose from. Food/drinks are also reasonably priced. The menu is small, but I was pleased to see there was a good selection of vegetarian/vegan options. Our service was a bit on the slow side, but we didn't really mind as we weren't in a rush to go anywhere. Looking forward to coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Normally love this place but today we all feel gouged. I would have loved to tell someone instead of write a review online but it looked like there were only employees working tonight.  We were told the wait was 30-45 mins, so we put our names on the waiting list, and actually waited inside of the space instead of leaving to wait for a call. After 1.5 hours of being ignored, they seemed to realize that we were still there waiting, even as a group of 5 in plain view. Then they somehow immediately found us a spot. How long were we waiting there for nothing?  Once we were sat we waited another long while before the server came by. We found out the price to play went up to 6 from 5, they didn't have the game we wanted (at all, but they do sell it) and the server took away our drinks before we were done with them. She then added gratuity to our group even though we were only a group of 5, and even though we were unhappy with the service and would have appreciated choosing our tipping amount.   The game master was very helpful though, wish I knew his name. And the poutine gravy is good.  Was originally happy that this place was getting more business but now it seems like they aren't paying attention anymore, at least on a Saturday night. I want this place to succeed and I hope things improve."}
{"text":"We came in a group, with few wheelchairs. Very disappointed with the service. The waitress didn't even come to check with us while we were eating, or get us what we asked for, didn't even apologies for forgetting. We had to call out another waitress for it. You pay gratitude for a great service, then it is okay even to add more, not for this kind of service."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to spend a few hours sipping coffee and playing games. The good is not the man draw. The game guru took our game likes (word games & trivia) & returned with 6 games. We kept 3 of them & enjoyed playing all 3. We arrived at 12:30 pm on a Saturday & there was plenty of room. My breakfast was adequate. The home fried & latte being the best parts. My daughter enjoyed her eggs Benedict. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Great location, good service.  It's huge in comparison to other/older locations which is great for decreased wait times.  I only had tea, popcorn and chips. I would have liked a better selection of snacks, but I'm there for the games so can't complain too much."}
{"text":"Restaurant prices for food. But worse than my own cooking - McDonald's could easily take over. Don't order any food here. Just drink water and play $5 for the board games."}
{"text":"Great place! I had the fries which were crispy and hand-cut and exactly how I like my fries to be! I'm excited that the menu contains a number of vegan/ vegetarian options that sound delicious (vegan poutine!)!!! We will be back to sample more food items and to play more games! The game selection is huge and the staff helps you pick games and helps you learn the games' rules! Fun!"}
{"text":"This place is so much fun! I love the board games and card game selections. There is literally something for everyone. We went for a friend's birthday and had a great time.   The staff there are really knowledgeable and friendly. They even helped us pick a game and showed us how to play it so it was easier to start playing. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Just know its very busy on the weekends so expect a wait.   A good majority of their walls are all covered in games so there is no lack of games or finding something you will like.  The drinks here are very very strong! Be aware. I like my drinks fruity and not have to taste the alcohol taste. I ordered the fruitiest drink they had and it was still strong even for my husband he was surprised. You can ask to have it made lighter but it didn't really help....  The burgers here are amazing!! I was seriously blown away. I would seriously go here just to order the burger if I lived closer they are that good. The bacon was perfectly crispy, the burger was so juicy and the cheese was great. There is no complaints whatsoever. You have to try them.  My friends order the chicken Caesar wrap and loved it as well. It was loaded so that every bite got some chicken and bacon, not like some wrap where you end up with a big bunch of bread.   The cakes are really good. I had the mango cheesecake and it was amazing. I wish I knew where they ordered it from.   The double chocolate cake is ok, nothing great about it. You could tell it had been sitting a couple of days.  The only thing that threw me off was how their tip system worked. I guess being in Mississauga I wasn't use to being force to tip 18%.  They tell you for groups of 6+ that they will put it on the bill, so we knew, but we didn't pay on one bill it was per couple, and they still put the 18% tip on all 5 bills. a Little surprised but I guess they have been ripped off before so they want to make sure their wait staff are cover.  Other than that everything was great, I high recommend everyone come here at least once. You will enjoy it.  Until next time XOXO, happy eats!"}
{"text":"A perfect night out with your friends! We were there on a Sunday night, and we were seated immediately, this branch is bigger than the other and accommodates faster.   There is a huge collection of board games for everyone, the staff can also teach u a new game if you wanted to be adventurous. The fee for accessing the game library is $5 per person.   We ended up playing Jenga and clue!   They have a few items on the drinks/food menu. I ordered a vanilla latte which was excellent and a marble cheese cake which was very tasty.   Would always recommend snakes and lattes for a fun night out!"}
{"text":"I have been to their old location which I believe is now closed but this one is far bigger and better. The menu is great and there are plenty of options in games to choose from.  We were here with 8 people but we ended up with a bad server. She was new and hence I assume not all of them are the same. She seemed annoyed at us and wanted us to make decisions quickly, something we were a little slow in since there were 8 of us. She didn't come to our table as often either.   Apart from the service, the ambience was great but you totally have to make reservations for the weekend. Definitely good for a large group."}
{"text":"This is a busy place with a fun vibe.  People are intensely into their games; some laughing, some carefully reading the game manual to clarify some debated rule, some quietly sitting back formulating their strategy. It's interesting to look around and check out what other people chose to play, and get ideas of what to try next.  The selection of games is quite good. Some are variations of more popular games. We tried Takenoko, which is a fun Japanese themed variation of Settlers of Catan. It took 3 hours to play because we had to learn the rules, and no one with us had played it before. The master gamers (servers) are helpful and know their stuff. We asked about a specific rule in this game, and she knew the answer (we checked later).  In total we tried 4 games over a period of 5 hours, some we gave up on because we just did have enough time to learn two complex games from scratch. We ended the night with Looping Chewie, which is really a quick kids game but was a blast and captured the looks of many other patrons who I have a feeling tried it after we left.  The food was okay, but pricy. Our friends liked that there were vegetarian options. It can be a challenge for space if you simultaneously have both food and play a game at a full table for four.  The bathrooms were were unisex stalls that looked like they were built on a low budget and haven't been maintained that well. Overall though, a great experience and I would come play again."}
{"text":"came here after visiting casaloma for halloween for a night of fun   we played a few board games and had their late night menu.  wasn't happy with their offering of food there wasn't anything warm.  we will come back again during the regular hours to try the food out."}
{"text":"Great boardgame atmosphere in the air (there). Huge location for snakes, much less depressing than the one at Bloor. Gets packed because people came in droves and it gets really loud. Lots of board game selection, they have like six full shelves of it. The food is meh, I'd suggest to eat before hand before coming here. The nachos was disgusting, felt like they microwaved the shit out of it.   Very affordable for groups, great team bonding place."}
{"text":"I got horrible service all night. My order of food never came and my server disappeared. Over an hour later a different server asked if I wanted anything else..."}
{"text":"Awesome place to have some food, drinks & play board games. This place is huge, lots of tables to play games. The food is good & the service great."}
{"text":"More than an hour long wait, AC breaks randomly, smelly air, and warm beer. Why would ever wanna come here."}
{"text":"This place is great! Sure, it gets packed and it's difficult to find someone to help explain a game, but the place is buzzing with buzzed people trying to learn how to play new games and have a good time. What's not to love?   The food is pretty standard bar food and it's greasy and great. Super enjoyable. The game selection is pretty varied (so bring the kids AND grandma if you want). I love that they have multiple copies of popular games, which makes it easier to hog an extra copy of Cards Against Humanity while your indecisive party argues over what to play first.   Affordable fun for everyone. I'm into it."}
{"text":"Nice location for Snakes and Lattes, lots of tables and well lit.  $5 all you can play fee for each person which is reasonable.  My group stayed for 5 hrs and we only played 2-3 games.  Too many choices to pick from as they have 2 full walls of games.  The food is also pretty good here, I got the Steak and Onion on Focaccia and the Wild Rice and Berry Salad.  The rest of the group got the grilled cheese sandwich.  We also got the House Made Kettle Chips to share which is pretty good and portion is generous. Overall had a great time here and would def come back again for more game nights."}
{"text":"First time coming to this location and it was pretty similar to the one on bloor. This one seemed a bit bigger because it was quite empty when I went. Like the bloor location, there is a large selection of board games and the staff there were pretty friendly and helpful. It's $8 for unlimited play and they have a lot of food and drinks there as well. I got the mac and cheese which was $9.5 before tax. It was pretty good. Kind of small but still very filling. Would definitely go again to this location or any one of the other ones they have."}
{"text":"Horrible time estimation. They are unreliable and inconsistent among their staff members. They also don't have seats for people on the waitlist. We've been standing for 2 hours for a table."}
{"text":"What do you do when you're done with drinking when you head downtown and just want to have a fun night with your friends...I think I've found the answer! This place is amazing I can remember the last time I stayed up until 2 am and ending the night on a high note. The menu is good not exceptional but who cares cuz the games are amazing! Literally no time restraint just sit and play all night if you want. I had the classic poutine it was delicious but I would say a modern interpretation of poutine. Coffee and dessert was excellent, especially the double chocolate cake from Wanda's. Our waiter was the nicest person I have ever met, we actually talked to his manager after just to give him kudos. We spent 5 hours playing carcassone and I'm ready to come back and try this place like next week. The wait is long, (we were told 2 hours on a Friday night)but they have a texting system that will give you 10 minutes notice to come back and they encourage people to leave rather than being held hostage while waiting for a table. Our wait ended up being less than an hour though. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying that I downloaded this app just to write this review. I'm a manager of a restaurant and I don't believe Yelp is accurate. I need to say this though, this is one of the worst service I have ever had. Ryan, our server was nowhere reaching any of my lowest expectations. We had to call him multiple times to get him to serve us. It took around 20m for us to get any drink on the table. The food order came wrong, we decided not to even bother asking for the missing orders. When we called him, he just nodded and never came back to the table. We had to bus our own table. I would totally understand this kind of service if the place was busy, but it was not and all the servers were just chit chatting at the bar."}
{"text":"I am a board games nerd and an absolute fan of this place. The only thing I did not like about my visit is that I couldn't stay longer and time flies when you are playing board games in good company and in such a nice place.  I really think that any board game you may want to play (6 bucks for playing as much as you want) - you can find it here, and the games/boxes are well taken care of. Lines and lines of shelves full of funny board games, nice coffee, nice service. The surprise of the evening was the cheesecake with strawberry topping - delicious too!"}
{"text":"I thought I would give up on the Snake and Lattes shops since I was let down several times whenever I visited the first bathurst/bloor location. However I'm glad I discovered the College location and gave it one more try. Rules are the same. $5 unlimited cover with a moderate menu of food and drinks. I do wish that the food costs would be less inflated though since there is a cover charge. Alternatively a waive of cover with food & drink purchase would be nice since costs add up quickly.  What's great about this location is that all the issues I had with the bloor and bathurst location have been addressed here. This location is spacious, clean feeling and brightly lit. Games are organized with special drawers dedicated to pencils, markers, etc, and most importantly you can actually get a seat here. If prices were better I would likely frequent more often and give this a 5 star."}
{"text":"Definitely a fun place to go in groups and you can spend however long you want playing board games, since there are shelves of many different games. You won't ever get bored of playing the same thing. The servers are also really helpful in recommending different games based on your interest and are very enthusiastic. The atmosphere of this place is all about good vibes and having a good time and you can get however loud you want and not be judged cause everyone's busy playing their own game. This place gets busy often and that's cause it's a popular hangout spot and anyone can find themselves staying longer than expected from getting too caught up with all the board games!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best and most spacious Snakes & Lattes location!  Board games are plentiful, of course, and very well organize. The place is kept really clean and staff are friendly. They come around to check on you every now and then in case you need anything and make sure you water is topped off. They also let you know when it's the last call for the night.  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Super chill vibes and a great atmosphere for hanging out with friends over drinks and board games. Service was great, and the collection of boardgames they have is huge. The only downside is that the place is always super busy--even on a late weeknight. We had to wait 45 minutes for our table so only had 2 hours to stay (they closed earlier than I expected, at around midnight), though the $6 play-all-you-want price makes it pretty worth."}
{"text":"The concept of snakes and lattes is amazing and the execution is also great. Wide range of games to choose from and a very reasonable food/drinks menu. The only downside is that on busy times there may be a long line up which could turn some customers away."}
{"text":"Eat before you go because the food is horrible. I love their board games selection and atmosphere. Went here for my cousin's birthday so happy they were able to acoomodate all 20 of us not happy we couldnt get separate checks .Paying got so confusing. Its a great place to spend hours playing board games and drinking something warm."}
{"text":"Used to be my #1 night out in the city, but I'm starting to get really disappointed with the development of the business.  What made Snakes and Lattes great in the past was that the staff was friendly, the drinks were great, the food was tasty, and the prices tied it all together by making it great value. Some of the newer changes are interesting. The cocktail menu is a real treat and the new, heftier food options are a welcome addition to a night out.  However service has become a serious issue at this location. My last visit, a few days ago, was kind of the breaking point for me. The bar was at capacity and only two servers were working the tables. I ordered a burger that took almost an hour to come back to me, and everything was cold. The burger itself was a puck about half the width of the bun. Other members of my party had their food orders simply disappear into the ether.   Really the prime issue, what irritates me the most, is that everything takes ages. It takes ages to wave someone down, it takes ages to get your drinks, it takes ages to get your food, it takes ages to get your bill.   The final kick in the shin is that as a table of 6 we were charged a 18% gratuity. I understand 6 people being a lot for a traditional restaurant, but we're talking about a location that specializes in board games and I don't think that's an excessively big group. But of course my issue isn't so much with being forced to tip, it's being forced to tip 18% for absolutely abysmal service.  My last few visits have been increasingly disappointing, and unfortunately I think I'm going to explore the other boardgame bars popping up around the city."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate St. Patrick's Day and had a really good time. We arrived around 10:30 pm and were seated at a long table big enough for 8 people about 15 minutes after we arrived. That is pretty good considering when Snakes and Lattes first opened, the wait would be 1-2 hours.  We ordered drinks, food, and played some games. The drinks were good all around and everyone enjoyed what they ordered.  We tried tons of items on the menu as well and everyone thought their food was pretty good.   I ordered the Harvest Kale Salad, which was made gluten and dairy free. It was really filling and full of nutritious ingredients like kale, quinoa, beets, and chickpeas.  My boyfriend ordered the Buffalo Cauliflower and he really enjoyed his dish. They tasted really flavourful and were vegan friendly. The only complaint is the dish was a little small.  We also ordered popcorn for dessert and we chose the dill flavour. It arrived drenched in the dill flavouring and was a bit too salty for our liking. Next time we will ask for plain popcorn instead.   Some of our other friends ordered sandwiches and said they were good.   All over, we would definitely return to Snakes and Lattes for another fun night with friends."}
{"text":"Visited this place for to recommendations from a friend that visited here multiple times before, and it definitely loved up to his hype.   The atmosphere here is great. You have the option between a bar area or regular bench-like tables and seats to sit on. The ambience was set nicely by the dim light. We were greeted by a make employee and or server was a female whose name started with A I believe (sorry forgot!). She was nice and converter cysteine we had a group or 7 and were a bit indecisive. We just ended up ordering a plate of $16 nachos which all us enjoyed. The portion size can fill up 3-4 people, but for us 7 it was more of a snack, which we were looking for. The nachos were crunchy and came with cheese, scallions, sour cream, and salsa; would definitely recommend them.   On to the board games, the place is surrounded by shelves covered with varies board games so they've got something for everyone. We ended up playing pictionary and bang. Bang is a bit hard to learn but very enjoyable. Didn't need the help of a game matter so can't comment on that.   Overall, we enjoyed this place. Great place to relax, have some fun, and eat!"}
{"text":"Super fun. Got great service and help picking a game from one of their board game masters. Good selection of beer and popcorn flavors."}
{"text":"I usually go the the Snakes & Lattes on Bloor but was happy to hear they expanded onto college. They have a great selection of board games and the the service is great. Whether you're a board game novice or a real elite, there's something for everyone!   Apart from their great selection of board games, they also serve food. While we didn't eat anything, the cappuccinos were really yummy and our water pitch was always full!   We stayed for about 4 hours before leaving for dinner elsewhere but would definitely visit again to try new games or play old favourites!"}
{"text":"Cute idea for a board game cafe! Definitely a clean and well-organized space with lots of seating, it's a nice place for a large group of friends. As well, a huge abundance of board games to choose from to play, and to potentially purchase from their little store selection! However, there is an $8 flat rate for each person as a \"sitting fee\". If you plan to stay a while, it is definitley good value. Nice ambiance, not too loud, with waiters constantly coming to check up on us!"}
{"text":"I simply had to check out this place! Board games all day? Count me in!  Being a weekend, it certainly was very busy. It took about 30mins to get a table which is pretty fast considering that peeps can stay there as long as they want.   It's one of the bigger board game caf√©s I've been to. There's an impressive selection of games and the staff are more than willing to recommend and teach you how to play. They're very enthusiastic, so it makes you wanna try new games there.  The only downside is that since it is a bigger open space, the noise level can get pretty overwhelming at times. It would be nice if they set aside a couple of party rooms for big groups, so that no has to yell to be heard.  Overall great place to hang out with friends! It's more fun in a group of 3 or more so that you can try a variety of games."}
{"text":"I pass by this place on my way to work on a regular basis and it never looked very appealing.  Who's idea was it to install wooden benches in a game cafe?  So uncomfortable and uninviting, and those cold metal chairs...  Visited their location on Bloor once, couldn't actually get a table but was very much unimpressed by the ambiance, so never went back.  Anyways, was meeting up with a couple of friends last night and decided to give the College location a try.  Since reservation could not be made over the phone, we just walked in and were told that there were 10 groups in front of us and it would be 1.5 hours wait.  Ok, understandable that it's Friday night and very busy, except we counted about 8 empty tables inside that could seat at least 4 people each. The girl at the front put our names on the list and we decided to stay by the bar and wait.   The bar counter is square but only has chairs (those horrible cold metal chairs) on two sides, so a total of about 12 seats, which is hardly enough considering how many people might be waiting.  After about 5 minutes the guy at the bar finally came over and gave us the beer menu.  We asked if they have a latte or a capucino and were told that the barista section is closed.  Hmm, not that hard to operate an espresso machine once it's set up and nobody is asking for fancy drinks.  This was a little after 11pm, so seriously, so much for Snakes and Lattes with no lattes.  They apparently had drip coffee but I heard it's horrible, so we didn't bother.   While we were waiting we were observing whether those empty tables were filling up and many of them were free for at least 30 minutes after we came in. If the process is such that the group gets a text message and has 10 minutes to get to the place after that, those tables should have been filled much sooner than that.  So much for efficiency.   After about 40 minutes of waiting we checked with the front girl again and were told we had 2 groups in front of us.  Both groups walked in soon after, but then this other group came and was seated before us and from overhearing the conversation, they did not have a reservation at all.  Finally when it was our turn, we walked over to the girl at the front and asked how come one of the tables has been empty for 15 minutes and she said it's for a group of 6, except right after she seated us, she seated a group of 4 guys there.   Once we got seated at those uncomfortable wooden benches, the server came up with the menu.  We asked about the latte again and were told that yes, the barista section closes early and that the lattes weren't selling well enough and that most people do not drink espresso drinks late at night.  We did not order food, so I cannot comment on it.   The game selection is good and once we picked a game, we enjoyed playing it, but at $5/person it was not worth it for 1 game.   I doubt I'll be back here again, certainly will not be for the atmosphere, maybe just to play some games, but I'd be hesitant to support such a poorly run business with so much potential to be better."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pleasant enough. The food is mediocre.  The service is terrible!  Wait staff went out of their way to avoid my table. I'm not sure how I've sinned against the wait staff but will never go back again. If I wanted to be looked down on and mistreated for a service I pay for, I'll go to France."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the quality of the food, and though the name suggests that it may only be board games and cafe-related fare, they do indeed have a full pub type menu, along with a long list of beers (including craft) with about 12 on draught.  I enjoyed my Belgian citrus wheat beer, which had as good a pour as any quality bar. But first and foremost, I was here for the games.  The place is huge, and I'd say there were comfortably a couple hundred people inside. And if you're worried that everyone might be scrambling for a few choice games, let your fears be subsided. They quite literally have several hundred games, and multiples of the most popular. I saw others playing Scatergories, and I was pleasantly surprised when they had another copy my table could pick up and play.  If you're into any type of board game and spending hours with friends, you can pretty much do no better than here."}
{"text":"Quite a big space with a lot of board game choices. Staff is efficient and the food menu is actually not bad. Their black bean burger was good.   The only thing I'd say would use improvement is their scheduling system for estimating wait times. It's not always the most useful as it could overestimate the wait time by a lot."}
{"text":"If you're looking to absolutely destroy some friendships, this is the place for you. This place has beer and walls of board games, the perfect combo for getting riotously drunk and smacking your best friends into last Tuesday.  The wait was insane (an hour and a half) but that's the nature of the place. If you're there, you're going to be there for a couple of hours at least. We just hung out at a bar across the street until we got called.  Seating is pretty comfortable and they have a fantastic selection of beer and games. There's also snacks, including vegan options. I had the Side Launch Dunkel, which was excellent, and we played some super fun games that I've never seen before. My friend wasn't kidding when he said that every time he goes to this place, he ends up spending $50 on amazon the next day. We played a game called Ghost Blitz which was incredibly simple, but super fun. Like \"someone's going to lose an eye\" fun.  Service is incredibly friendly and the game wardens, or whatever they're called, (if they're not called game wardens, they should be) were very helpful in helping us find new games to check out.  We had a ton of laughs and had a great night. No friendships were destroyed at our table, but I can't say the same for the table beside us who decided to play the worst game of all time: Monopoly. Guys, if you're going to check this place out, do yourself a favour and play a game that you can't get for $1 at a garage sale."}
{"text":"I love the size of this location! Whether you come as part of a large group, or on a date, there's a variety of seating arrangements. This location also has a bar area and two pool tables (additional charge per hour). The game selection is huge, and the game experts are very kind, knowledgeable, and frequently come up to guests to see if they need help. The games here are new or are in very good condition. I love that there's always something new for me to try. I ordered the root chips which is a huge size. I also had the fresh veggie rolls which was okay. I think the wrapper or the rice noodles were a bit on the dry side. The menu accommodated vegans which is awesome. I wish they had the sandwhiches and meals they offer on Bloor though."}
{"text":"When it comes to board game cafes, I was really impressed with this one. The board game library is substantial, there is ample space to play games, and the food and drink menu is pretty good. I really appreciated the fact that the washrooms were for all genders: it's nice to see that in more places these days.  The windows let in some outside light and the atmosphere is great with large wooden tables on which to game. I highly recommend a visit to this location!"}
{"text":"We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and I was amazed at how big this Snakes & Lattes location was!  There was a huge space for many, many tables of people to sit at to play board games with their friends.  There were also two walls lined up with huge bookcases on which hundreds of board games could be chosen to play with."}
{"text":"I am a Stratego and a Dungeons & Dragons fan. The moment I stepped in there about a month ago, I was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere was awesome and the concept was even more awesome.  Had a latte and a sandwich, tasted amazing. Pleasant and helpful staff. The staff took time to explain whats in the cafe.  Wish one of em came to Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night to play games and although they don't take reservations, the wait time wasn't too long. The store is really big with a lot of tables and outlets with USB ports to charge your phones which is great for people who stay for a long time.  It's a good deal to sit and play for $6 and you can play for as long as you want. Trust me when I say you're going to want to stay for a long time because they have a huge selection of games. We played until 1:50AM and browsed their mini store before leaving and I didn't see them rushing anyone to leave which was really nice.  The staff was really friendly and helpful. They were always checking to see if we needed anything and was happy to explain the games. We were struggling to figure out Cash and Guns so this was a big help!  I did find that this place was really loud because everyone was really into their games but this made the atmosphere really lively. And usually, the loudest tables are playing the best games so don't be shy to look around to see what people are playing!  We got Nachos ($16) without any add ons so it was just chips, mixed peppers, cheese, sour cream and pico de gallo. It was pretty big, was enough for 7 people to share. I really liked the seasoning that they sprinkled onto the chips.  Sweet Potato Fries ($7) nothing special, just sweet potato fries with sriracha mayo on the side. Was nice and crispy.  Kahl√∫a Creme Br√ªl√©e ($7) good creme br√ªl√©e, topped with blueberries and blackberries which complimented the creme br√ªl√©e so nicely.  Carrot Cake ($8) so frickin good. One of the best carrot cakes I've ever had, would definitely get this again next time.  Chai Latte ($5.50) really good with just the right amount of chai flavour. Paired well with the carrot cake. Had a pretty design on the top too! I give this place a 4/5 because although everything was great, the food and drinks were expensive and there's also an 18% gratitude for groups of 6+. This is understandable because they gotta make money somehow so that's not going to stop me from coming back :)"}
{"text":"Great place to come with a group of friends any boring night and just play a ton of games. It's pretty loud in here but because everyone's just having such a great time with their friends over whatever game they chose that day.  I come here pretty often and the food just isn't great. It's good if you're hungry and just wana snack but it's really not worth coming for the food. The games are where it's at.  Although, plus side, they now serve alcohol (: Definitely try to come with some games I am mind because the options seem to be endless. But even if you don't, the staff do know their stuff and will help you out."}
{"text":"A large space with a massive collection of games. They aren't too busy on weekday evenings - a table of 6 of us were seated right away at 7:30pm. The food selection isn't very extensive, but they do have  the basic pub foods and vegan/vegetarian options. Their drink menu doesn't disappoint and they have different specials depending on the day of the week.   The only downside is that they have an automatic $18% tip for groups over 6 people. I didn't mind too much, since we received great, attentive service. We also asked the workers for game recommendations and to explain games to us and help us run a few rounds to make sure we were doing it right. They did more than just bring us food and clear our tables, so the automatic 18% wasn't too unreasonable."}
{"text":"Lots of games and a huge venue but gets very packed on a Friday evening so most of the games we were looking for were already in use. The service was fine although a slight mix up on my drink and she sorta rushed explaining a game to us. Also odd that they couldnt split the bill for a bigger group yet still applies an 18% grat making it more difficult for everyone to pay exactly for what they ordered along with the $5 playing fee plus tax/tip.  Nutella latte needs more nutella for being $6 before tax as it was kind of bland also the mugs are small. Chai creme brulee was actually really good. Brewed drip coffee was ok, liked the brown sugar cubes.  Menu prices are on the higher side for food/drinks but you are there to play games. I do have preference to some other game board cafes but would come back if in the area. Note that this place is really loud so gets difficult hearing each other for games that requires talking, aka almost all of them."}
{"text":"Super rad spot! Perfect spot to hangout with friends, play games, & enjoy yummy food & drinks! It's also awesome for getting coffee/tea & small bites and working of studying with headphones in. All round really unique spot that would work well for a variety of situations. Definitely worth checking out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm not a big game person by any means (and my company that 'dragged' me here can attest to that) but it's definitely a place any person who wants to try something different with good friends in a laid back atmosphere should try at least once. Did not have any food but the drinks (alcohol and non-alcoholic) were good and the prices reasonable. Staff was friendly and attentive. Massive selection of games so I can see how someone who is into games would come here to try things out before buying their own. And they have a store in the front with prices comparable to amazon. Again, not a game person but rooting for a creative concept place like this to last."}
{"text":"Always a good time!!!!! I like this location better than the other ones in terms of food selection/choices"}
{"text":"Sorry they don't even deserve a star. I walked up the the bar, unpacked my books to read. Sat waiting. Not one person came to acknowledge I was at the bar. There were 6 servers behind the bar all giggling and having a great time. One bartender /server, or whom ever because you don't know who is who, talked to someone 2 seats down from me. They seemed to be coworkers. And I wait. I sat for a couple minutes and started to pack my things as nobody still had  acknowledged that I existed. Even as I was packing up and put my coat back on, I still was invisible. I even noticed a couple getting there bill and waiting for the server to bring their change and he actually waived the guest over to him to get their change.   Shaking head.... Will never return."}
{"text":"This is a very good location for Snakes and Lattes.  The large well-lit space is probably ideal for large parties because it seems they would be able to accommodate.  The picnic bench tables can be a tight squeeze for larger groups but I think it comfortable seats four regular sized males.  We played Splendor and later on Rah (really good game that almost looked unplayed, even the game master came over to tell us how he really enjoys it!).  The cover charge($5) remains the same price which is fantastic.  I actually expected them to raise it to $10 because you could easily spend hours here.  They still have multitudes of boards games here for any size group to choose from and have a good time.  We didn't order any food but the menu looks like it has a good selection that will satisfy any hunger whilst board gaming.  The beer selection is good.  Servers are very attentive and friendly as well.  Will definitely mark this as a go-to spot for board gaming activities in the future."}
{"text":"Snakes & Lattes were OUT OF LATTES by 11pm on a busy Saturday night. Their kitchen was also closed, which I think is way too early considering the store officially closes at 2am.   When we receievd our bill, for some reason our waiter counted 12, when we clearly had 11. When we brought it to his attention, he lied and said somebody told him 12. Good thing my cousin was there to quickly correct him and said \"I told you 10 initially.\"   I like the concept of the business, but the service definitely needs improvement. I don't understand how you can associate your business with lattes, but stop selling them well in advance before closing."}
{"text":"Bad service..We ordered a vegan salad and came out with... bed bugs!! When shown to the server, she just took away the plate and didn't say much.   Waited to see if the food will be replaced. But the server didn't even bother to let us know what's happening with the order. When I flagged her down, she replied by saying; sorry the kitchen is closed and all we have is popcorn!! WTF?!   We were really hungry and very disappointed. Would have stayed longer and ordered other food but this place didn't deserve my business.   Would recommend the bloor st location better then this."}
{"text":"I will say it's so much fun but the food is sub par and expensive and service isn't great either. My kale salad was eh and the poutine is generic. Nachos are the farthest thing from good nachos. Asked for water like 3x and the waiter's forgot about me. I went once with a big party and the service tip was already built in and so the waitstaff gave up on good customer service. The cheesecake was really bad and it made both of my friends stomach hurt.   They do have some good drinks and a good chicken cesar wrap. But don't go and pay for overpriced food and a entry fee of $8 unless you're planning on staying for 5+ hours.  Music was not good."}
{"text":"Arrived here at 3:15 with a group of 3. We were quoted a wait time of 30-40 minutes which seemed long with the number of vacant, larger tables in the cafe. We went elsewhere for a drink while we waited for the text to let us know that our table would be ready.  Once we had been waiting for an hour we decided to come back and check on the wait time. The hostess seemed unconcerned when she told us that there were still 7 tables to be seated before my party. At this point we gave up and left. After 2 hours we received a text letting us know that our table would be ready. Staff should be trained to provide accurate wait times, or not quote at all! Extremely disappointed with my experience."}
{"text":"Such a fun place for a wholesome geeky night out! Some cider + cards against humanity on a Friday night? I'm sold.  Huge bookshelves of all the board/card games you can imagine, this location is really open and spacious with rows of comfy wooden benches and tables. The atmosphere is the perfect blend of a warm cozy cafe with an animated crowd.   Having a meager game collection at home, for $5 I got access to try out an extensive selection of board/card games for what seems to be an unlimited time frame. What a deal. They also have super helpful staff that are around to expertly explain the games if you have any questions. And how cute is the Sushi Go card game!  We didn't order anything to eat so can't comment on the food but who comes to snakes and lattes for gourmet food anyways? I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The concept of this place is awesome. My boyfriend and I got an ice coffee with shots of Bailey in them and it came to about $15.00.    The reason this place is not getting a 5 star review from me, is because the servers at the main center spot took forever to see if we were done with our drinks and at that point, we were ready to go.    Other than that, if you're in Toronto, you HAVE to go here!"}
{"text":"Serves 5stars Environment 5 stars Vegan poutine 2 stars; the amount of sodium was overwhelming, and I couldn't really eat the tofu because of it."}
{"text":"Games are great and so are the drinks when u finally get them, but the service is awful or should I say non existent. We waited about 20 minutes before speaking to a server.  the only reason we got to speak someone was because we called someone over. When she came we ordered drinks. I asked her what the deserts of the day are. The menu said \"ask your server\" so I did...but she said \"I'm not Ur server but I'll check\" . Well she never came back. Not a fan. Didn't get to order anything other then the first drink. Won't be coming back unless I'm dragged there"}
{"text":"When you want to have a chill evening with friends that turns into raucous laughter as the evening goes on...come here!  There are 2 locations but from what people tell me this one is less slammed than the Bloor location.  It's huge - there are plenty of seats/tables and there is even bar seating if there are only 2 of you.  The games are unlimited- feel free to grab a few and start playing.  Don't know what to play or don't understand a game??  No worries- just call the game sommelier (official title- game master) and they will help you figure things out!  It's $6 per person for the evening to play.  There is a small pub fare type menu - several types of purine, Mac/cheese, burgers, fried chicken, coffees/tea and alcoholic beverages.  The food is ok - nothing special - much cheaper than the food in the area.  Do yourself a favor and spend a few hours here playing known games ( cards of humanity, Jenna, monopoly) or try new games (Anomia, let's build it)   Ready, set, MATCH!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere  Sooo much selection even after having to wait an hour we were well looked after! Food is good too!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for a get together with friends- they have ALL the board games and we're very well maintained. They had a great selection of drinks and our waiter was very friendly and helpful. I would not however come here for dinner - the burgers were so dry and didn't taste that great - the kitchen messed up my order twice which I as frustrating. But other than  the food - great vibes and I do recommend!"}
{"text":"Snakes & Lattes is always a fun place to hangout with friends for hours and I really enjoyed this location as it seemed a lot more spacious than the bloor location. It's $8 which is pricer than it was the last time I went, bur still not bad for the amount of board games they offer. Ordered the mocha latte with almond milk which I really enjoyed as it wasn't too strong or sweet. Looking forward to coming back to try their cauliflower wings!"}
{"text":"I've actually NEVER got a chance to try the food there!  Which is sad because I've always wanted to try out what was on the menu.  I've been to this location with my best friend twice and well, we liked the drinks we ordered...   I loved the board games that were provided.  My favorite is Cards Against Humanity.  Unfortunately I always arrive AFTER the kitchen is closed... which is why I never got to try the food.  But I will one day... even if it is for takeout... if they do that...  Thanks."}
{"text":"Great fun but why do they keep playing the same 5 songs over and over and over ! So much Funky town !"}
{"text":"Love the new-ish location.  Much bigger which means a lot easier to get a table!    I also like that they have lattes AND booze now.  Good selection of games - with a guru walking around to give you suggestions or explain games.  Friendly, knowledgable staff.  Their menu is a bit small but seem to make things in house.  Gets warm as well in here"}
{"text":"This snakes and latte is very big and brightly lit! We came here on a busy sat night. The server took down our info for the wait list and we were able to get a seat at the bar while we waited for a table. We were able to play games at the bar, which was good! They will send you a text when your table is ready.  We ordered a slice of cake, which is supplied from Wanda's. They give a big slice and it was delicious. Drinks are yummy as well.  The server recommended games for us, brought it over, and showed us how to play them. He was super friendly, which is a plus!  Admission is $6."}
{"text":"Never been here before but have wanted to visit for a while now. My boyfriend and I decided to finally check it out today.  Awesome selection of board games, friendly staff and pretty quiet when we visited (approx 2-5pm).  The tea was ok, the coffee was ok, a little too strong and bitter so I didn't finish it, but they were reasonably priced.   Will be back here again very soon!"}
{"text":"Snakes and Lattes newest location on College has so much space. Always a great place to hangout for a $5 fee and there is a huge variety of board games to choose from. The staff are super friendly and there are dedicated \"game experts\" that will suggest games for you based on what you like and will sit down with you to teach you how to play. I had a beer here, but it was quite flat so maybe they don't refresh it as regularly as they should."}
{"text":"Great service overall , food was pretty Good,  nothing too special .  Many selections of board games , wish there were more board game gurus . Was not busy on a weekday , Many seats ."}
{"text":"I've only been to the location at Bloor. I preferred this more. The ambience, staff, and heck has anyone ever noticed their \"all gendered washrooms\"? Nice one guys!  The food a little disappointing and their lattes too were meh. But fun selection of games. Try something new or ask for a recommendation!   Yes, I recommend."}
{"text":"Large selection of games. We were seated fairly quickly for a group of 9 (45 minutes). Charged $6 per person for the entire visit. Gratuity was automatically applied. Our server was good for the first hour or so but it was quite difficult to grab him as time went on for more orders or even just refills on water. It felt as if our server paid more attention to smaller groups since a tip from our larger group was automatically 18% gratuity. The group probably would have ordered more food/beverages if the server was around more. Perhaps more staff are needed on a Saturday night. Food was good, prices average. Best part of the night was the company of our group and the games. The rest of our experience was metiocre."}
{"text":"Snakes & Lattes? What an awesome theme.   When you walk in, a couple of the walls are lined with huge shelves that are completely full of board games. They have multiple of the more popular ones so that they don't run out during their peak times.  The large group (my co-workers and bosses) that I came with had no trouble finding seating on a Friday morning around 10 a.m.   I tried their vegan tofu breakfast sandwich, which is just a simple slice of tofu and some veggies with vegan mayo on an english muffin. For some reason, (my own fault) I expected the tofu layer to look like their tofu scramble; so I was a bit disappointed when it arrived. However, biting into it, it tasted pretty good. My co-worker said the tofu scramble he ordered was actually fairly bland/simple.  I also got to try poutine for the first time - because they had the availability for vegan poutine! I believe they used tofu crumbles in place of cheese, and of course mushroom gravy. I found it to be kind of bland except for a couple bites. Maybe it was an uneven spreading of some kind of spice? I am not sure.  I would come back again... but since I'm from California, I doubt I will be."}
{"text":"I got ripped off when I received the bill.  I ordered Peruvian sandwich with sweet potatoes fries (you can make it at home, cheaper and healthier!)  As I lived in Peru for few years, this dish isn't not very authentic but that's ok!  The sweet potatoes fries is too salty! I got disappointed in the end when I received the bill. I only played few games for short time and got bored with them.  I asked a lady if theres a puzzle game which is best to exercise brain, they don't have any."}
{"text":"I need my city to get a board game cafe!! This was so fun, came here with 3 friends and shared nachos and had some beers. The nachos were actually really good, and the game selection was wide. I was in the mood for something sweet and was disappointed by their desserts. $6 cover to play games feels a little pricey when you buy a few drinks, but there's a high demand for tables here so the market is there regardless."}
{"text":"Coming from NYC during our vacation, the amount of space this place has is mind-blowing! My husband and I came here twice during our week-long visit. The classic boozy coffees are phenomenal and totally something everyone should try. Their cocktails were okay-- not as good but still alright. The cider selection is very impressive however!  I really appreciate how organized the games are-- sectioned off by type of game, then color coded by whether it's 2-player friendly, easy to pick up, intermediate, or for experienced players. My husband and I definitely fall into the experienced category, but we still had an absolute ball with some easier ones too!  Finally, I loved all of our servers. Our first server in particular was amazing and even gave us this really awesome circus arts place to check out in Seattle for our next vacation later this year. (Thank you! We love you for that!) There are plenty of folks working there who will happily stop and help you learn how to play a new game. It's amazing. My friends from home are already planning our next trip up to Toronto so I can take them here!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place! Great selection of board games and beers, and the service is great. Honestly, the only bad thing is that it's so popular we had to wait over an hour for a table last night! :)"}
{"text":"Awesome games and staff. Good beer list. Horrible food. Ordered nachos, Mediterranean dip, buffalo cauliflower. What an opportunity there is to put a good chef in place!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Please keep in mind that there is a cover change and then you can  spend unlimtied time at the place.   They have hundreds of board games and you can spend good time with company and play them while can enjoy drinks and food. Friendly staff will recommend and teach you different games as well.   The food and drink quality is just an average but the concept is awesome.  Will go back there again."}
{"text":"Happened upon this spot & we were excited as we love games and wish there was a spot like this in our city. I'm an espresso enthusiast and the Americano was was dark brew, strong and delicious. The staff is very kind and the energy of the people in the cafe was fun. They have a massive game selection and we had a good time playing a few games! It's $5 per person to play any games for as long as you'd like. They kindly checked on us regularly and refilled water often."}
{"text":"Amazing place! I just found out you can invest in this company now 2. AMFE stock is the ticker. I can go to my favorite place and invest in a growing chain! How can this get any better!"}
{"text":"Waited 1.5hrs on a Sunday afternoon for a table of 9. There's no time limit or reservations so it's unknown when you will be seated. After we sat down and placed our order it took 45mins for any food/coffee to even come to our table. When we paid the waitress did not inform us tip was included (18%) and some of us tipped 32% unknowingly. After wanting to complain our waitress disappeared to the point we weren't able to find her and we were stuck having to leave as service was not present at all.   Would not return here."}
{"text":"Arrived with a group of 7 at 6:30pm and put our name down to be seated. We were quoted approximately 90 minutes for a seating. We were seated at 8:15pm 105 minutes later.   Here's where I want to share my big regret of the night with y'all so that you learn from my mistakes and need not be haunted the way I was. To kill time my group and I popped across the street to Sneaky Dees and had some drinks. I decided I would wait until we were seated at Snakes & Lattes to order food, which I did. I ordered the nachos. Well guess what? Sneaky Dees has the best nachos in Toronto next door. They have a whole variety of them and I watched everyone order and eat them while I delayed my nacho eating for board game time. Big mistake. The nachos at Snakes & Lattes are crap. Anyone can make better nachos at their house and for $14 before add-ons, they're really poor value. So while you're killing time before playing Monopoly go get nachos at Sneaky Dees or simply eat elsewhere.   I've saved you all a world of regret. You're welcome."}
{"text":"After visiting the annex location we stopped in here for a bit. Tons of games and full service bar to help lube up the non gamers so they can be convinced to play something other than card against humanity."}
{"text":"Board games and amazing vegan friendly food.  Hard to go wrong. Creme brulee, poutine with bacon, fried cauliflower with guacamole, ranch sauce and siracha then house blend old fashions.  All vegan.  Bring friends with you to play the games."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Snakes & Lattes last week! It was my first time there and I was really impressed - lots of game options, a nice space, and good food.   I had the veggie burger which was probably the best veg burger I've ever had. The side salad was decent but nothing special. Beers were $5, and there were lots of options.   The table in the booth we sat at was huge - lots of room to play game and also have space for plates and glasses.   One thing that bothered me was that we were charged a fee to play - I understand that's standard at this sort of establishment but since it wasn't communicated when we sat down (nor did it seem to be on any signs or written on the menu) I was very surprised to see a $6 charge on my bill. With 4 of us each charged $6 to play we're up to $24 - well on our way to just buying settlers of catan and being able to play at home."}
{"text":"Good spot to go with friends for a night out. They have a huge selection of board games - very easy to pick games. The staff was fantastic. The only downside is the food options - nothing was appetizing, nor was any of it bar food. I would seriously recommend management reconsider the menu."}
{"text":"I came her late in the afternoon on a Saturday and this place was packed! More packed the the original location on Bloor. There was a lot of kids there which I don't really see at the Bloor Location. This location serves alcohol which is something the Bloor location is missing this location also has a few pool tables. It a lot bigger then the Bloor location and fits more people, then again its on College and Bathurst instead of Bloor and Bathurst.   Ive had the Hot chocolate and the salted caramel latte and both are great. Ive been meaning to try the Mac and Cheese but I havent gotten around to it. The service is always suburb.   My only complaint would have to be the number of kids in this location, Im not a fan of the sound of LOUD children, so I would rather not having to deal with since this location does sere alcohol they should have followed the same system as they did at Snakes and Lagers.  Id probably rather go to the Bloor location just because theres not any kids there but if Im in the area I may come back to this one if I really felt like it and maybe if it was later in the evening so that there would be so many kids."}
{"text":"So much fun! Food was good, although I wish some of the games were in better condition. Some board games were actually very dirty and sticky. I find myself constantly going to the washroom to wash my hands."}
{"text":"I love snakes and lattes!! Recommend coming with a group of people. Street parking available as well as lots further down the street on the west.  They have a better selection of food than what I would imagine a place like this to be. Beer and mixed drinks available, as well as caffeine.   Tons of games to choose from, and they sort it/label it based on the genre and # of people. So even if you're a bit tipsy, you should still be able to pick out a game!  Friendly staff. I never came here when it is super packed. I believe if you come a bit before dinner time then you're safe."}
{"text":"Snakes and lattes is a great destination for a relaxing rainy (or snowy) afternoon. Pay $8 for all day play. This location is MASSIVE. They have hundreds of board games - some well known, others completely obscure. They're sorted by genre such as 'strategy', 'reflex' etc. and labelled based on how many players are required for easy navigation. The staff at this location were absolutely lovely - very friendly and helpful and always excited to teach a new game. One staff member walked us through a complex board game called Pandemic step by step, watched us play a couple of rounds and even made a point to check in with us to make sure we were on the right track. The staff here seem to really enjoy their jobs and they all seem very knowledgeable about the games they carry.  Snakes & Lattes also features a full bar and menu! The only pitfall was that the food could use a bit of work. It's overpriced and 'okay' at best - maybe eat before you go? Definitely a great spot to pass a few hours with your mates over a couple of cold bevvies and some board games though! I'll be back for sure! Cheers"}
{"text":"Best place ever !! Great food, great coffee and the biggest selection of board games for all ages !!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about Snakes and Lattes. Glad they took over the old Andy Pool Hall spot. Makes for a much better experience not having to wait several hours for a table."}
{"text":"We arrived here today with a group of 3 at 3:15. We were quoted a 30-40 minute wait time but noticed many vacant, larger tables in the cafe. We went elsewhere for a drink while waiting for a text informing that a table was ready. We had been waiting for an hour and we decided to come back and check on the wait time. The hostess seemed unconcerned when she told us that there were still 7 tables to be seated before my party. We left confused as to why she quoted us 30-40 minutes knowing the number of  tables were actually ahead of us. we gave up and left having wasted hours of our day.  2 hours passed and we received a text letting us know that our table would be ready. Staff should be trained to provide accurate wait times, or not quote at all! Extremely disappointed with my experience."}
{"text":"5per person and you can spend 10 hours sitting and playing with your friends, washroom break? Sure they have washrooms. Food break? Sure they have food. Run out of games? I doubt that lol its a good place to meet up with friends and have fun.   Down side is that they don't do online reservations (hence you can actually stay for 10 hours). For a party of 5+ finding a seat could be difficult. If you'd like to play with your group at say 9pm you'd probably need to put your name down at 6pm. (This was on a Friday night though, not sure how easy it is to get a table for a large group(we were 12) on a weekday)."}
{"text":"My husband has been dying to visit a board game cafe for quite some time, it was top of our list when we visited Toronto last month. We were amazed by the selection of games, and how everything ran like a well oiled machine. I love how comfortable the atmosphere is--we played about 4 games, next to us a couple played one more in depth game, and behind us was a mother and son playing more child centered games. There is something truly for everyone! The staff is very friendly and willing to chat, and the menu has a lot of selection, whether you are feeling like you want a meal, or a snack, drinks or coffees...it's a great experience.  We live about an hour and a half away...it's worth the drive just for a visit to Snakes & Lattes!"}
{"text":"The server was very unaccommodating when it came to splitting the bill. She forced us to join a larger group because we knew them, even though we didn't sit with them or come at the same time. I would have rather had the bill with the 3 friends I sat with, not with 14 other people that sat on the other side of the room. Ridiculous.  I regret paying the gratuity fee as it was not deserved and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Personally I like the feel of the Bathurst location for some odd reason, it seems more homie and cafe like to me there. But that doesn't mean that this place isn't bad! I like it and how there are benches to allow larger groups. There is just this one table that gets bad lighting so you can't really see but you can't go wrong with playing board games with your friends. Also the game gurus are always knowledgeable on how to play any game."}
{"text":"This is such a cool place! As new Aussies in Toronto, our server was also an Aussie! The booth set up and long tables is a great way to have large parties. The range of games is ginormous and there is also a games master who can help you our or suggest any games for your interest. With a decent selections of alcoholic beverages, the burgers are pretty good too! Go have some fun and learn a new game!"}
{"text":"Thought this place was better than the other location.  The actual space was much bigger and looked nicer. Also it was brighter, so it was easier to see.  Both locations had different menus, and I can't really compare the food, but for this location I had the poutine and it was drenched in gravy (it was like fries in soup), so I did not enjoy it as much as I wanted to.  The staff was friendly tho, and I love the concept of board game cafes!!! Plus $5 for as long as you want is really good."}
{"text":"omg weekday morning drip is only 1 dollar. Such good price! spacious cafe with tons of board games"}
{"text":"Great place to go. Whenever I'm in town, I go with my friends all the time. It's a great casual place to talk to each other, catch up and just have fun.   I was there just the past Monday and my friends and I were seated right away. The place was almost completely empty at 6pm, so empty that one of the servers actually had to go home!  Service: The service was pretty good. The server we had was pretty chatty with us and very friendly. At each of the games we played, she would talk to us a little bit and never ignored our table. The food and drinks came to our table pretty quickly. We, at one point, didn't know how to play a game, so we had to ask someone to come and teach it to us and he was super nice, straightforward, not nervous at all and spent the whole time explaining to us. He paid a lot of attention and even stayed with us the first game to ensure that we knew what we were doing. All the staff was pretty awesome.  Food: Not a great menu, the food and drinks are a tad pricy (although all draft beer is $7), but the food is good. They hand make their fries (you can tell, that's probably why they're $6) and they're fried deliciously. My friends all ordered burgers and pastries and the food was delicious. I would really recommend the burgers, they are huge, juicy and delicious. However, as mentioned before, the menu isn't great. There isn't a lot of variety and it's kind of expensive for what it is.   Games: The games were amazing. My friends and I played different games all day adn i have to say, the library is substantial. There are two walls filled with games and experts everywhere to help you out. I would recommend games like Bells and Klask. Great games.   This is a great place for a group hang out or even a first date - great way to break the ice."}
{"text":"I was super upset with my stay here. I admit that we had a surprise large party, and i don't under any circumstances blame our waitress for being a bit frazzled when our group of 10 turned into 20. That was poor planning on our part and i would like to apologize to our waitress for that stress [I also can't remember her name... ] I also would like to say thank you to the manager for handeling our complaints and questions very well, and very professionally. They are THE ONLY reason i'm giving two stars.   What upset me about our experience was the fact that they won't do more than one bill for a large group as a company. They also won't do more than 1 payment method unless absolutely necessary. They claim that this is necessary on fridays and Saturdays, which is ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE. literally no other food based business operates this way, and when you have a total of 20 people, it's insane to ask one person to foot the bill when it's probably $500+  At 20 people, it's $8 a head and you have an automatic 18% gratuity. This alone with tax comes to a little over $200. They also use touchbistro, a system made for small companies to make splitting and keeping track of bills simple AND affordable. I've been personally using touch bistro for the last 2 years of my life. I understand that cashing out 20 people is time consuming and not ideal, but EXCLUSIVELY ALLOWING only 1 payment method is unprofessional.  I will not be back, i'd much rather spend my money at a smaller establishment that cares about it's customers. The staff were awesome, but the business and the way it makes policies to treat it's customers sucks."}
{"text":"I had a friend visiting from another province and this was the perfect place to spend a rainy afternoon. We arrived slightly before the lunch hour and were still able to order from the brunch menu. I ordered the BLT and my friend ordered the eggs florentine, both were super tasty and devoured very quickly. We also got lattes and they were equally good and well presented. The space itself is very large and offers a wide variety of board games from old favourites to new. On this particular day they had a game specialist that could help you pick out a game or explain how to play. There is a table charge of $8 per table to play the games, well worth the money. Overall, we had a very enjoyable time here and would return."}
{"text":"Service wasn't great at this location, and the general vibe isn't as nice or as lively as the Bloor location. I'd definitely recommend going to the Bloor location over this one."}
{"text":"This location is bright and spacious. They carry a big selections of board games for you to purchase.  This is a nice place to hang out with friends. It can get very busy and loud on weekends in evenings."}
{"text":"Upside: - Great and wide selection of games  - Abundant seatings - Friendly staff - A plenty of vegan food - Gender-neutral washroom - Many washroom cubicles, so even if it is a fullhouse night, there won't be lines - Each cubicle has its own sink!  Downside: - $8+tax entrance fee sounds steep if you are not spending the whole day there (note that it was $6+tax last December) - 18% gratuity for a group of 6 or more, so you end up paying $10.48/person - Ultra expensive food and there is no decent options around the premise, so come with a filled tummy"}
{"text":"Came here with 2 of my friends. They failed to mention the 8+ tax cover fee per person so unfortunately when I arrived I was surprised by the entry fee. I ordered a simple box fries which was 6+ dollars and not that special. the staff was friendly but over worked, and the prices were ridiculously high and not appropriate for the type of food being provided. Overall, I was able to enjoy myself, but the high prices makes it unlikely for me to return."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!!! So COOL & FUN   We ordered some beverages and plated various board games.  Their homemade flavoured popcorn is so good!! They have various flavours and a fun snack to eat while playing games.  Their staff are experts in explaining the games they have and what's even more cool you can buy new games as well there."}
{"text":"Ok let's see what I thought about this place,  and yes people I do love board games. The Venue itself is casual, modern and boring deco, the seats are uncomfortable, service is not the greatest, takes so long to get a drink,  but I guess people come here to socialize and hang out with friends and just have a good time playing game boards,  who cares about food or service at this place I'm I right?"}
