{"text":"Last evening my family and I went to The Rail Tavern, we were excited to have a new restaurant in Waxhaw.  Upon entering the establishment we were greeted by a friendly hostess who seated us promptly. The decor of the building was very nice and upscale.
The wait staff was very friendly and returned frequently for drink refills and checking to see if anything else was needed. The food was presented nicely and looked good, however...the temperature of the food left something to be desired. There were 4 people in our party and each had the same problem. The main entree was warm at best while the sides were all cold. The french fries looked appetizing, they were golden brown and one would think since they were just delivered to the table they would be crisp and hot...not the case.  One of the orders was a hamburger and the cheese wasn't even melted on it because the patty was not warm enough by the time the cheese was applied to melt it. It seemed as if the sides were plated onto cold plates and left there until the entree was done being prepared...and then left to sit for another 5-10 min. before being served.
I realize that this restaurant is new, so I may try it again in a few months once the kitchen has gotten into the swing of things to see if the temperature of the food has improved. It was hard to judge the flavor of the food since it was frigid."}
{"text":"I am typically not someone to go out of their way to bash a place of business. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, especially when they have first opened. I worked in the restaurant business while I was in college and I know things can get hectic, but there is NEVER an excuse to be so blatantly rude and disrespectful to customers. 
First, I will say that the decor and atmospehere was awesome. Unfortunately, that is the only positive thing I can say. We sat down and looked at the menu. It was so ridiculously overpriced. If you want a burger it's $8.50. If you want a slice of cheese on it, add another .50. If you want onions on it, add another .50. This meal comes with chips. I ordered the turkey sandwich. You wouldn't think you could mess up a turkey sandwich, but this had to be the most disgusting thing I had ever put in my mouth. 
We asked them what was on their kid's menu. She said we don't have an actual kids menu, but we have stuff for kids. OK...we asked, \"like what?\" and she said \"chicken tenders.\" and then just kind of stared at us with this blank look. ummm....ok. 
Then our dishes sat on our table for the entire time. We paid our bill with our appetizer and dinner dishes still sitting on the table. 
When the server came back with our bill we realized she had only swiped our card for $2.38. Clearly, we owed more. So, my husband went to tell the server and she was seriously clueless about what to do. She said she would go talk to a manager. We waited for 15 minutes and still no one had come back to our table. At this point, our 3.5 year old was getting restless, so I told my husband I was going to take him out to the car. We continued to wait for an additional TWENTY minutes. My husband finally came back out and said the server couldn't give him a voided receipt for the first swipe of our card. At this point, I was really upset. Thirty five minutes we waited after initially paying and a manager didn't even come by to apologize. So, I went inside and asked to speak with a manager. She came out and was so unbelievably rude to me....in front of every customer in the lobby. She told me that researching the issue had put her behind and acted as though I had really inconvenienced her when it was her server that made the error. hell...we could have walked out and not paid what we owed! She finally said that there was nothing she could do and walked away. I was STUNNED. 
I went home and posted something on their Facebook page about our experience. This morning I saw that they had deleted it! So, when you read good reviews on a business' website and are impressed with the fact that there is nothing bad being said, its probably because they just delete the bad stuff! 
Anyways...the overpriced menu, the terrible food, the awful service and the incredibly unproffesional management are all reasons why i wouldn't step back in that place if someone paid me.
UPDATE!!!
The Rail Tavern ended up sending me a gift certificate for myself and 2 guests.  My husband and i went back this past weekend with our son and my parents.  The service was great (our server, Brittany, was awesome), the food tasty and the manager (Denise) ended up comping our entire bill!  We are so happy for the turn around and look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"This place is closed.  They remodeled an old fish rest and then were open just a few short months and closed."}
{"text":"Another good experience.  No fish smell, which was mentioned previously, although there are fish dishes, such as the wonderful pan-fried Talapia I had tonight.  Four filets cooked perfectly.  Asked to substitute wild rice for potato and not a problem.  A very amply portion.

Wife had, again, the Cajun spicy  cream, sausage penne.  Nice spice, but if you don't like spice you might want to shy away from this one.  But it is very excellent.

Ordered a house side salad, for only $3, and it was more than enough for wife and I.  I always ask for what dressings are made in-house and they only have one that is excellent:  Greek balsamic citrus.  Light, tangy and well balanced.  Not the brown goop you get with balsamic served in other places. Definitely a winner. 

Tried an appetizer tonight:  house potato chips with pimento dip.  WONDERFUL!  Dip was hot, creamy and had a garlic touch and great flavor.  Enough chips to serve four.  They have a good selection of appetizers, so we decided to just have appetizers on our next visit.

Clean and neat, tastefully decorated.  Service was super with frequent check-ins.

Full bar and their drink menu is laid out by \"taste\", esp the wines.  Crisp and clean whites and robust or fruity reds.  Other categories and think other restaurants should follow this example.

Gave 4 stars, but think it was more of a 3.5.  Need a few more visits and a more complete sampling of dishes to go to full 4-stars.,

Give it a try.  Lots of choices which should satisfy everyone in your group. Good date place."}
{"text":"Went there the day after it opened, and I was impressed with the selection in the Menu.  They even feature a small nod to the former \"Captain's Galley\" if you are a seafood type.  I had the spicy cajun pasta and I was glad to say...it was actually spicy! The sausage was a little overcooked, but everything tasted great.  Their drink selection is also pretty good, and everything is reasonably priced.  I have heard that the wait is getting pretty lengthy there for dinner. I also wish they would open for lunch, but I am certainly not going to hate on a place that is actually open on a Monday in Waxhaw!

(Also proud to say, I am the one that added this place to Yelp... :) )"}
{"text":"Didn't think this place would stay open long...  The new place that opened in it's place (nick's steak & tap house) won't last long either if the ability to know rare from well done doesn't improve!"}
{"text":"The rumor around town is that this new place is worth the visit, \"the food is good but the wait staff need more experience\" was heard more than once...so, we gave it a try this evening.  

First of all, \"KUDOS\" on my Wife's order.  She is very particular in what she can eat and when we go \"out\", I often plan for the worst because something inevitably gets served differently than requested.  Not here.  Her order was EXACTLY as ordered, Filet cooked perfectly for her as well as the other side items.  She was very pleased and you have to know that is rare and a tall order to fill.  I enjoyed the meal as did the others in our party.

One offer of advice to the management, PLEASE stop the entire staff from asking how everything is!  One person asked three times during the course of the evening and I would say at least every five minutes someone else would stop by and inquire (more than 10 times!).  Very annoying and disruptive, especially when you're in the middle of a conversation, please leave it to the server and the manager!!"}
