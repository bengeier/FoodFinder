{"text":"Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli is one of my favorite places to eat. I use to go a lot back then, when the owner Alex somehow disappearred to the Middle East ( maybe finally getting married ).  They use to stack their portions with a lot of meat. Since new ownership, they are cut back on the protons but the food is awesome as usual. Their mix grill and chicken kabobs are a must try. With the aromatic smell of their rice along with a side salad with greek dressing, it compliments the meat very well. Their homemade lemonade was very tasty and the owner is very nice along with his staff. Kinda like home cooking except when they get super busy, be prepared to wait awhile, but well worth it."}
{"text":"I am often way too lazy to write a review but this place is so amazing that I must do it.    After reading on Yelp! about all the goodness of this place, I gave it a try. I love middle eastern food and grew up in NY where we have very good middle eastern food.    I was greeted very warmly by the owner, Isam.  I told him I heard about their famous lemonade so I will have that and something else he would recommend.  He gave me a sweet smile and told me that the lemonade is on the house as it is my first time.  (how nice!)  I ordered to go the Lebanese chicken (one breast split in halves, rice, tabouli, and one large fluffy, pillowy pita made fresh) and the falafel (smaller than I'm used to but very tasty) that came with tahini sauce that is very very good.    I finished my drink before the food came and he gave me a free refill!   I wanted to get a lemonade for my coworker to go, and he gave me that for free too!   He was very easy to speak with.  I hate going to places where the food is great but the owner makes you feel like you should beg (think Seinfeld and the soup nazi).  But this guy was very nice.  There was a lady behind me who went for the first time yesterday, and came back today with her friend.  The owner immediately recognized her and apologized to her for something.  It turned out that there was a guy (I think from the store next door) that was bothering her as she walked in yesterday.  She told the owner about it. The owner (after she left) spoke to the guy and he apologized to her for what he did yesterday.  The owner also apologized for the guy's behavior.  What a man!  My food was really really good.  And when he packed my food in the bag, he gave me two big slices of bahkalava on the house (again)!!  I am definitely coming back and bringing more people."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time for some gyros and a shawerma. I was disappointed in the gyro. It had way too much sauce and lettuce in it and little meat. It tasted more like a wet salad. The shawerma however, was delicious. It had more than enough meat, the flavor was good and it was very filling. I would highly recommend the lemonade, that was also tasty. Again, opt for the shawerma and skip the gyro!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Nice, friendly service, AMAZING food, and a great selection of food you can get and reheat at home as well! Everybody is so friendly. And the lemonade is to die for!"}
{"text":"We walked in just as they had finished a fresh batch of Gluten Free pita. We're not Gluten Free, but we like to try new things, and did I mention it had just been baked? It was AMAZING. Soft, pillow like clouds of deliciousness. We also got a small container of hummus, which was also very good. We split the falafel plate as well. The falafel plate was slightly small, but the falafels were some of the freshest I've had in Phoenix. The tabouli salad was also very fresh, and coincidentally gluten free. Then the owner gave us the rosewater(?) lemonade on the house! Seriously, it was like being at a friends house. I will be going back soon for more pita, hummus, and tabouli! Mmmmmm pita...."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service! Best lemonade and Turkish coffee in Phoenix. The dessert is great too!"}
{"text":"I asked a friend at The Arizona Republic if I could write a review on the best falafel in town. He didn't really seem to like the idea and never got back to me. Too bad, because I was looking forward to going to all the other Middle Eastern restaurants in town and comparing their falafel to MEBAD's, which is the best I've had in town so far.  The falafel at MEBAD is usually fantastic. Crispy on the outside, moist and tasty on the inside.  It's not overly oily and I've never had a dry falafel ball. And they're just the right size, about the size of a pinball. Occasionally I'll get a batch that is only slightly warmed up instead of freshly cooked, but they're still quite good.  The falafel sandwich is fine -- there are four or five balls in a pita with fresh lettuce, tomato and tahini for under $5 (I think) -- but I prefer the a la carte order, 5 piece falafel with a side of tahini and fresh pita for a couple bucks. I usually order that as an appetizer,  to share with others or eat myself in addition to a sandwich when I'm extra hungry.  Other than the falafel, I'm partial to the chicken gyros sandwich or plate. It's pieces of grilled chicken breast with lots of yummy middle eastern spices (which I think are still made and sold on premises) and caramelized onions. Couple that with tsatziki sauce + fresh pita and you've got one heck of a meal.  If you've got a sweet tooth, try the rice pudding, it's excellent. The baklava and halvah are great, too, but the pudding is the real winner. Made fresh daily and usually sells out. Now, if they could only make a dessert out of falafel...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend works at the pawn shop next door, (not nearly as seedy as it looks - stop in and buy some junk!), and I love middle eastern food - those two cardinal reasons are what prompted me to visit the Middle Eastern Bakery, and I have never been disappointed by anything...except for the parking and the long waits.   The falafel is delicious...some of the best I've ever had, and while I do not consider myself to be a connoisseur, I do consider myself to be relatively well-versed in the arts of falafel! I love the lemonade. The hummus is probably the only thing I am not crazy about...it is pretty basic, without a lot of accouterments and extra ingredients. This might really do it for you, but I have developed an unfortunate taste for hummus that is less authentic and more \"fancy.\"   Parking is difficult at almost anytime of the day, because the businesses right there, (the pawn shop, the Middle Eastern Bakery and the antique store), have their own parking lots but experience overflow from the other businesses frequently. Pawn shop customers park in the Middle Eastern Bakery lot, and vice-versa. However, don't be discouraged by a full front lot! There is a large (if a little forbidding-looking) parking lot behind the Middle Eastern Bakery - it is perfectly fine to park there and walk through the little alley to the Bakery.   Esam, the man who owns/runs the Middle Eastern Bakery, is very friendly and funny. If you visit often, he will remember you and will often surprise you with fun freebies - I have received more free halva than I could ever eat. You will receive more charming and personalized service if you go when it is slow, (morning time, after 1:00 PM), but I have never seen him be curt or unfriendly.   Speaking of slow vs. busy times - if you are going there at any time close to your lunch break, you will find it to be very busy. There are usually two long, discouraging lines - one, of people ordering their food, and the second of people waiting to receive the food they've ordered. It can be overwhelmingly crowded at times, and it has been a rare occasion that I've made it in and out in under half an hour. If you have a long lunch, good for you! Head over there. If not, maybe wait to try the Middle Eastern Bakery on your day off.   If you are a hookah enthusiast, they have a small assortment of shisha and hookah accessories for sale. They also sell a variety of middle eastern products and knick-knacks."}
{"text":"Four stars for location but five stars for food and service.  This place doesn't look like much from the outside...or the inside.  I have probably driven by it a million times but never thought twice about eating here.  Finally I did! The food is delicious and the service very friendly, they are happy to explain the menu and offer recommendations.  They offer gluten free options, they even brought me some gluten free pita bread to enjoy with my meal and it was very tasty.  They have lots of spices and breads (gluten free also), desserts, international foods.  Most of the food they sell in the grocery section they make in store daily, so you know it's fresh.  This is a must try! Oh, and they also have THE best lemonade (seriously, they won an award for it) made with rosewater and honey, yum.  And try the Turkish coffee at the end of your meal, so tasty."}
{"text":"The BEST authentic middle eastern cuisine in Phoenix bar none. My wife is of Lebanese descent and she loves this place. The kibbie  sandwich and gyro are to die for.The grocery store is a virtual cornucopia! Go for a late breakfast or an early lunch, you wont be disappointed! All the entrees are fresh and  tasty. I especially like the tabbouleh or babba ganoush as a side! Home-made pita bread is delicious, but they can be stingy with it. Don't be afraid to ask for more. Music and atmosphere are an A+"}
{"text":"Bad food, fruit flies all over our food while we are eating.. Dirty place. Will never come again."}
{"text":"husband & wife team own this spot that frequently gets crowded during the lunch rush. was told the location has been around for more than 4 decades.  the recipes and care are apparent at Middle Eastern Deli...been here multiple times and the crowd is always cool, the service is always friendly, and the FOOD is always on point. homemade pitas, best falafel i've had anywhere is always piping hot, good sides, great chicken. the small kitchen belies the bevy of flavors. even the sides of hummus that come w/ the combo plates are clearly fresh/homemade. for me, the bakery case is hit or miss - it's definitely authentic and some of the flavors, such as dates, pistachio and olive oil in a dessert are probably too potent for my (dessert) taste. i personally favor the savory side here.   i only wish there were more spots like this in phoenix. it would then truly be a great food city, like Chicago or San Francisco. we need more authentic places like this and LESS \"Sam Fox Concepts\" which are basically high-priced Cheesecake Factories.  at Middle Eastern Deli, the prices are also on the high-er side: $12/$13 for a combo plate, $2 for a small lemonade (made w/ honey and rose water - YUM).  however, it's WORTH IT when the higher prices are for good-quality ingredients and a family lineage of delicious recipes.  the inside can get a bit cramped but this is what you'd see up and down the streets of New York...if Phoenix were an older city, more spaces like this would exist and it wouldn't seem like such an anomaly.  big city charm off 16th St in central Phoenix...who would've thought?  awesome."}
{"text":"This was by far NOT THE BEST LEMONADE in AZ! It tasted like lemonade concentrate +  mountain dew + honey. I was overall disappointed with the food. It was very sloppy & cold even for a hole in the wall place."}
{"text":"Best in the valley, and I think I have tried everyone else! The decor I am sure will leave alot to be desired for folks who care about such things, but to me home style cooking in a homey atmosphere is perfect. Get the lemonade, the large, and a refill to go, best beverage experience in town."}
{"text":"The best there is! Try the lamb and chicken kabab plate with rice and Greek salad! You won't be disappointed.  Also, don't forget to try the lemonade."}
{"text":"Well, 1- The food is great. 2- The lemonade is great. 3- The owner and people that work there are very friendly.  Just go and eat there, you will enjoy it : )"}
{"text":"Hands down the absolute best falafel sandwich ever tasted - the house made hot sauce is exceptional and a perfect compliment to the sandwich. Lemonade is out of this world delicious. Authentic food and authentic people - perfect experience."}
{"text":"This is the for-real stuff.  Amazing falafel pita.  Super good food and as always I enjoy checking the shelves for interesting things to try while they're getting my order ready."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of spending some time in line to support this wonderful shop last week after their windows were smashed again. This family run market, bakery, and restaurant is something I think every neighborhood would benefit from. I only had time to grab some baklava and cheesy pita, but they were both phenomenal."}
{"text":"This place is sooooooo awesome!!!!  I eat here at least once a week. The staff is friendly and the environment is awesome. If you don't know what to get they always recommend something good. lately I've been getting the lamb Kabob."}
{"text":"used go here allot, never again, the gyro is small with 3 thin slices of meat. it is about half normal thickness of meat normally. worse gyro ever. went to check out cheese prices raised prices to that of whole foods. what a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Food was decent A little bit of a dive but clean and staff friendly.  Would go back again if I was in the area, but wouldn't take a trip to go there."}
{"text":"The Lebanese chicken is amazing! The people that work there are incredibly nice and they have excellent customer service. The wait time can get a little lengthy during the lunch rush, but it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"The best in the State! The owner and staff are exceptional people. Great food that is always the same, delicious!"}
{"text":"This a terrific place to go if you want excellent, homemade-style Mediterranean food, served by some of the nicest people you'll ever meet!  I brought a tray of their baklava to a party and it was a big hit! Just go! You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Beyond impressed with the owner's hospitality and kindness! This is a very casual place with a small store and deli. Everything tasted super fresh and they sell a lot of gluten free items in the deli and freezer section.  My husband and I went here for dinner on our way (from Tucson) to a baseball game in Phoenix. I searched google for a restaurant with gluten free options and this place came up with very positive reviews.  When we got there the owner greeted us warmly and I asked what he suggested and told him we haven't tried Middle Eastern food before. He told us the combo plate would be a good sample of lamb, Lebanese chicken, and beef. It came with a Greek salad and rice, but the owner also gave us a side of gluten free tabouli (free of charge!). Everything was great! Moist meats, perfectly cooked rice, and fresh salad (olives contain pits).  We also ordered hummus with pitas. He gave us extra gluten free pitas (free of charge again!). The hummus was sooo good! A really nice light garlic flavor and the pitas were AMAZING. We couldn't get over how light and fluffy, slightly chewy the GF pitas were.  The owner gave us free drinks. The lemonade is flippin awesome. If you go, you HAVE TO order it. Also free were Turkish coffees and samples of baklava and halva. The baklava is not GF, but they are working on a GF recipe for it. My husband felt bad about saying how unbelievable it was haha. I really liked the halva, it had great flavor and consistency.   The shop was well stocked and had a lot of spices and good variety of items. When I asked the owner about if they sold the coffee we tried, he brought it over and asked if I wanted to learn to make it, he said he take me back to the kitchen and have them show me how! I WISH we had had more time to learn. He also gave us fresh, warm GF pita to buy instead of the frozen!   We plan on going back soon."}
{"text":"Wow - where to start? What an amazing place with incredibly friendly and welcoming staff. I was raised in a Greek household and the hospitality here made me feel at home.  For starters - the falafel is served in a fresh pita (baked fresh at the deli!), through-and-through, a very satisfying experience. For a little zing, add their hot/spicy sauce which has a nice hot kick, but not burning (it's also good mixed with hummus).  The dolmades were excellent with crisp grape leaves that have just the right amount of *snap* to them. Not too soggy, not too raw - perfect. I've eaten these my whole life and can confidently say that they are made with care and attention! The tabouli was super fresh and aromatic - it was the first time I'd had it and it was a pleasant surprise.  At the recommendation of the owner, we had the lemonade - which is sweetened with honey and made with rose water - and it is very refreshing (I had half and half with tea/lemonade).  For me - one of the minor highlights were the kalamata olives WITH pits, which are much firmer and more enjoyable than olives that are pitted. It has a great grocery selection and a wide variety of fresh-baked foods in their freezer section included (but not limited to) pastitsio, moussaka, tiropita and spanakopita.  The owner was very, very accommodating and attentive to us - and the rest of the staff was very friendly. It was a warm, inviting experience and I can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"I came across this wonderful jewel by a complet accident.  I was getting my car battery charged and just decided to walk over and get a bite to eat.  The owner help me pick a meal as I have never eaten middle eastern before and I must say . Best food I have had (sorry mom)"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Everything is amazing, absolutely everything. The tabouli and baklava is the best I've ever had. Not to mention the lemonade and the wonderful owner. He is such a delight and a genuinely kind man. I love his free food and radiant smile. Excellent customer service and I come weekly."}
{"text":"The shawerma pita is amazing. The meat is well-cooked and very flavorful and the pita itself is always soft and delicious but sturdy enough to hold everything together.   Oh and the owner gave me an on-the-house lemonade while I waited. This alone would bring me back, plus the lemonade is probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Been looking long and hard for good Middle Eastern food and can say finally found it! Got the combo salad with gf tabulhi, tahini cucumber salad and some sort of bean salad. Not a fan of the bean salad but the rest was so yummy and they gave me gf pita too! Ate some of my husbands rice and that was so good because it had hints of lemon. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, the lemonade. It really is the best lemonade I've ever had. And the baklava- this is the real deal. So far that's all I've had after stopping in today, but based on those two items alone I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place says it is open until 7pm, I got there at 6:40pm ava the closed sign was up and the doors were locked.... Not cool"}
{"text":"I think that Middle Eastern Bakery is just OK. I tend to judge a middle eastern place by their gyro platter. I am immediately skeptical if the gyro meat is not carved off a vertical roaster (I am sure there is a more proper name for that thing) and instead looks like it came out of some sort of preformed mold.   Unfortunately at this place, it does not appear carved. The gyro is all the same size and each piece looks exactly the same. It tastes fine, but nothing that blew my mind.   The hummus here is pretty good, and I do enjoy the Greek salad.   Solid execution. Nice staff, casual atmosphere. You won't be blown away, but you won't be disappointed either."}
{"text":"After moving to Bay Area, i still miss this place SOOOO MUCH.   Baba, rice pilaf, lamb, gyros, salad, oh my god. BRING IT HERE to Norcal."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been a customer for over five years. I bring my friends there to  show them a little gem in Phoenix. This is a very casual place where they remember you and treat you nicely. If you are snob this is not the place for you.   The gentleman that owns it and the employees are simple adorable. It is like a family.   One funny fact is that to use the restroom you have to go behind the front desk. The restroom is small but impeccable. I am very picky with restrooms. It is clean and that is what I like. It has not to be fancy just clean.  My favorite food is tabouli. The best in town.   Hope you enjoy it as much as I do."}
{"text":"What a fantastic neighborhood gem! This bakery and restaurant has the most delicious food and friendly service. Order a falafel gyro add feta with a fat lemonade to drink! The dolmades (with or without meat) are also tasty and flavorful! If you like it spicy try the home made hit sauce.   We also shop in the deli part of the store. Gluten free pita bread, fresh hummus, and spices galore! I would recommend this restaurant for dining in or take out."}
{"text":"The lemonade, the lunch, the grocery store...everything here is amazing! I randomly ended up here today for lunch and the reviews did not disappoint. The pita bread was fluffy, the hummus was smooth, and the salad dressing tasted very fresh and authentic. The man at the cash ( I am assuming the owner) sold me on the lemonade which was probably the best lemonade ever! The lemonade is made with rosewater and honey, no sugar added. I will be returning soon to try their famous Baklava!"}
{"text":"One of the best middle eastern places to go. The food was so good and the service was great. It's a small old place yet it's filled with signature and life. The place was pact full at 12 pm,  yet we had so much fun waiting for the food. You have to try the Arabian coffee after you done with the food. It's so good."}
{"text":"I went here today with some co-workers. Everyone came away happy and willing to go back. The shop is a half restaurant / half grocery store affair and I will second all of the comments on good service. They go out of their way to make sure you're happy and \"real\" restaurants could learn a thing or two from them. The food itself wasn't to die for but definitely hit the spot. I recommend you give it a shot."}
{"text":"I checked out this place yelp because I wanted falafel and this is what pops up. Thank goodness for yelp because it has just introduced me to a wonderful love of middle eastern food for CHEAP.  Place is awesome, chill, laid back, and CHEAP. people that don't like it sound like they are a bit snooty,   Actually, the falafel was good, hummus was... eh. but that falafel, it was GOOD, haven't had a good one since I returned from across the pond, eh eh eh!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised here in Phoenix, Arizona and I am always skeptical of trying new places. I was invited here to have lunch with a handsome foodie friend of mine and loved it! I have been here 3 times and each time I ordered a gyro. OMG! The meat that they use is lamb and beef and it is scrumptious. It is a small place inside and they have a TV with the occasional sexy belly dancer singing a beautiful song in a language I do not understand. LOL They are always very polite here and my plate is about $8 each time."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch and was not disappointed. The chicken kabob platter was perfect and amazing, and the lemonade is so good it should be illegal."}
{"text":"A place well worth visiting.  Not only does it make fresh baklava (oh YUM) but it has frozen and packaged food in addition to the deli/restaurant.  The gentleman behind me in line said he'd been coming there for 3-4 years and the gyro meat would melt in your mouth.  When he reached the register, Saed greeted him like an old friend.  That kind of place is precious in this world of chain restaurants.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could.  This place is a bit out of the way for us, but we love it so much it's worth the drive.  The food is scrumptious - the best Middle Eastern in town!   I especially love their falafel sandwich and tabouli.  The fresh baked pita bread and zatar bread are incredible!  We always end up bringing home some groceries as well.  And the owner is so very nice.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"For lunch, snack or grocery it works. I have a pita breads and humus for $6 to take to my office and skip lunch."}
{"text":"Great food! Not greasy. Pita bread and hummus are my favorite. Falafels are never dry, unlike most places. And the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Love it. First time here, and I love the initial experience. My appetite wasn't the largest so I just had a gyros sandwich, but what I was served was the best gyros I've eaten in my years in Arizona (not an exaggeration).  Friendly staff and a nice, store-like atmosphere. Definitely check it out for lunch!"}
{"text":"1. This place is awesome 2. The staff is unbelievably generous and friendly 3. A great option for vegetarians 4. The falafel is the best in town 5. THE LEMONADE. OMG, THE LEMONADE. We're addicted."}
{"text":"I'm all about the hummus and the tabouli.  It's the best tabouli in town.  Lots of cool unique items to try in the grocery area and the nicest people run the place.  Make sure you grab some pita bread to take home."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a quick dinner with family, and let me start off by saying everything was stupendous. I had the mixed plate with tabouli and a side of hummus. Chicken and beef had lots of flavor, and weren't dry. The pita bread was the best I've ever had, and the lemonade is a must. The owner brought us a free sample of falafel, which was sweet of him. My sister ordered the wrong item, and he offered to bring her something different. Instead, we weren't charged for it because he thought she didn't enjoy it much (though she actually did!) They're all friendly and want to please. I'm always on the lookout for great Middle Eastern food, and this place did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and very authentic! Their dessert is amazing!  It was my first time to ever taste Halvah and it is super delicious paired with the Turkish coffee.  The owner is super nice and pleasant. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Simply the best feta cheese and olives anywhere. Fresh and full of flavor. there is a difference and you can find it at athe Middle eastern deli"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Delicious food and excellent friendly service.  One of the easiest reviews to write ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Great baklava, shawarma, taboueh, and pita. They also have a grocery store. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been a fan for at least 15 years.  The honey-rosewater lemonade is the best in all of AZ if not the world.  I'll stop by for tabbouli to go, and I'm in heaven with the gyro & tabbouli instead of the salad. My wife goes for the chicken kabobs.    On one trip, I met a lady and her mom visiting from San Francisco (former Zonies) that bring an extra carry-on bag to load up on pita bread.   Great food, great family owned business.  Sipport them."}
{"text":"Food was not good! The Pita bread was spongy, the falafels were dry and the hummus was quite bland. Not much feta on the salad either. Very very surprised about the rave reviews. Prices were not great. We ate lunch."}
{"text":"Lamb kabobs were very dry, and tasteless. Probably cooked earlier, stored and reheated. Chicken kabobs were way over cooked; very very dry, no moisture whatsoever.  Tabouli was very good, as was the rice.  Lavash was good, but would have been better if it was fresh. The service was good."}
{"text":"I think overall this place has great Middle Eastern food. I didn't get to try all the platters I wanted but I was impressed with the main entrees. The Lebanese Chicken was delicious. Service was great too, as our questions were answered all the way through. I would like to come back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment several times and have enjoyed every single meal. The first visit was the most memorable as the owner asked me if it was my first time eating there and if I wanted a description of the menu items. That made me pause and take the time to learn about the menu offerings instead of rushing through the ordering process.   I have tried the Lebanese chicken plate, falafel sandwich, and the chicken schwarma. I have never been disappointed with any of my meals. The Greek salad is fresh and crisp with a great dressing. Last but not least is the always fresh warm pita bread that accompanies every meal I've had.   I often purchase a stack of fresh pita to enjoy at home. The pita is freezable in the event that you can't eat it all right away. Today I purchased fresh lavosh that came right out of the oven!   Great service and consistently excellent food!"}
{"text":"cool place! has everything from- grape leaves, to Turkish coffee! Their pastries are spot on Middle Eastern, unlike the Bavaria you get at Safeway."}
{"text":"Family owned and operated restaurant with middle eastern grocery store. The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious. I had the Schwarama sandwich and it was delicious. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Went today for the first time with my daughter. This place is absolutely wonderful! The owners couldn't be nicer or more helpful and they went above and beyond in their service to both of us before, during and after our meal. The food is delightful and flavorful and very traditional and the fact that they offer GLUTEN FREE on most of their menu is outstanding. I picked this because of the other reviews and because my daughter eats mostly gluten free and I am also trying to cut wheat from my diet. I recommend this great homey place 100% but please don't expect fancy at all. It is a deli inside a wonderful little store and there is generous seating for such a small place but not tons. I had Shwarma sandwich and it was wonderful."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mediterranean food restaurant. Their menu is amazing and the lemonade is fantastic."}
{"text":"Yummy! The food is great. I love the lemonade! They have a cool selection of middle eastern food. They have awesome baked goodies. It's the perfect Mom and Pop shop with GREAT service."}
{"text":"Delicious food and reasonable pricing for the portion size. Haven't found anything I don't like here. My favorite by far is the Lebanese chicken paired with the homemade lemonade. I always take home fresh made pita bread as well from the market side of the store. It's super fluffy. Parking can be an issue and there is limited seating, but it's worth the food."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their food is fresh and always tasty. Their lemonade is a dream. This is the only place I go to eat when I'm in this part of town. It's a small family business and they're always remarkably kind.   The business has been vandalized a few times over the years by disgusting bigots. So come here and enjoy some great food and service... and piss off the racists while you're at it."}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch. So yummy food. The place is really small, but great food, (fresh) , great service, and the best part, their LEMONADE.Made out of rose water, ginger, honey. Must have drink when you go there."}
{"text":"The schwarma is delicious, it's almost as good as what I had when I lived in the Middle East, and the hot sauce is very flavorful, without being so hot that it's inedible. I always take home a package of their fresh pita, which is better than any I've had locally, and their baba ganoush. They also have an excellent, if small, selection of fresh, frozen and packaged foods; I usually buy the labne."}
{"text":"The most wonderful and gracious host Mr.Isam has the best baklava and Turkish coffee.  Hands down THE BEST LEMONADE EVER MADE!!! The Fresh halavah is DELICIOUS!  We highly recommend this wonderful place!!!"}
{"text":"When I last lived in Phoenix, I would pass by this place repeatedly, vowing that next time I would stop and give it a try. Well, \"next time\" became today for lunch, and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I ordered their kibbeh appetizer and a falafel pita sandwich. The kibbeh, again, like at Haji Baba, was served more like a piece of pie rather than a dumpling with a fried bulgur wheat shell, but this time, happily, the meat was well seasoned. Their falafel was fresh and soft inside, with a bit of crunch on the outside, and nicely spiced. The portions were just right. I would definitely come here again. Already, I look forward to trying their Middle Eastern spinach pie, which I haven't enjoyed in a long time. I know some people might find it unusual to have a restaurant in the middle of a grocery store, but I was not put off by it. In fact, after eating, I had the opportunity to do some browsing and spotted jars of an Egyptian lentil soup spice blend on sale, which I intend to buy during a future visit. As far as my first impression is concerned, the Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli is a hidden gem near downtown Phoenix. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I always passed by this place when I'd go down 16th street but I never thought about going in to try it. I'm a student at Phoenix College and for my biology class we had an assignment to go to a store of another culture and study the food they eat and the main ingredients of their diet. I wanted to do a different culture that I didn't know that much about. Since it's just right down the road it was the perfect place to finish the assignment but still be able to get back in a few hours to go to lab.   When we got there I told the man that I had an assignment so walking around with a piece of paper and looking at things wouldn't scare him into thinking we were from the health department or something. He was totally fine with it and we went on our way to getting the assignment done. Of course the cultural experience comes with actually trying the food from the culture. I got some pita bread with hummus while my friend tried the imjadora. We shared so we all got to try the different things. The food was very good! Not only that but they kept coming over to check to see how we were doing. He even let us try the falafel which was also incredible. I am amazed not only by this great food but the amazing service that my friends and I received at this place. I have to say it's the best I have ever seen at a restaurant and we will definitely make it a place to eat lunch at more often."}
{"text":"Great food and very hospitable owners.  The Lebonese chicken plate and the Gyro plate are my favorite. I stand in solidarity with this business during a pivotal time in our community."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and delicious. I always get the chicken kabob plate with rice and salad. I also ask for the hot sauce on the side (love it!). Chicken is grilled and the portions are a good size. The rosemary lemonade with rose water is my favorite! They make their pita bread and it's always fresh! There are an assortment of baked sweets like baklava. You can also pick up middle eastern grocery items too.   I like this place, and the owner is always happy to see you!"}
{"text":"We experienced the worst service! The service was so bad that my fiancé actually complained (which is traditionally my role). We waited a good 15-20 minutes for our food. At first I thought the kitchen was just slow. Nope, not the case, THREE people that ordered AFTER US got served their food before us! After the third party got served, we went to the owner and told him we never received our food. He went to the kitchen and said that it'll be right out. We sat down and another person that ordered after us got their food. Then a few minutes later ours came out.  To add more insult to injury, the owner was out on the floor talking to regulars that had ordered after us and had already received their food. The owner was either too busy talking to notice that we hadn't received our order, or simply didn't care because we weren't regulars. Needless to say, we will not be returning to this place. There are other great Middle Eastern restaurants in Phoenix that provide excellent service."}
{"text":"When I saw they had Fattoush I had to run right over.  I haven't had a Fattoush salad since I move to Phoenix.  Well.... the salad was good but it wasn't the Fattoush I'm used to. Instead of fresh parsley, sumac and purslane, there was dried parsley no sumac, or purslane and instead of toasted fresh pita there were very hard croutons.  Don't get me wrong the salad was still good, but not the fattoush I'm used to.  My quest for the fattoush I remember continues.  I will return to try their schwarmae and they have a nice little middle eastern grocery as well."}
{"text":"I thought I reviewed this place ages ago and realize that it was all in my head. Perhaps because I live so close to it that I thought I reviewed it by osmosis.  Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli is a one-stop shop for a lot of Middle Eastern foodstuffs, from jars of olives to tins of nougat and from 4-foot tall hookahs to intricately carved wooden backgammon boards. The market is small, and as such its offerings aren't nearly as abundant as Baiz Market a few miles down the road, but it has most core items well in stock.  As for the food, I've had the chicken kebab plate. I realize this is what I order at all of these joints, but it's a good gauge to see how each establishment prepares this dish. Chicken may seem easy, but to do it well you have to marinate the pieces long enough and cook it just right so its not pink or conversely not dry.   I thought my plate was a decent, albeit standard, effort. Nothing about it really leaped out at me, but would I eat it again? Probably. I've done it twice more already. I've also had the hummus and tabbouleh which were decent.  That said, I'll have to order other dishes, like the lamb, to see if the extra stars are lying elsewhere. There is a case displaying baklava and other desserts, in case you happen to be driving along 16th St and develop an intense craving for some out of nowhere.  All in all, 3 stars for now. It's a solid, little establishment that provides all the basics, in both the restaurant and the market. Perhaps superlatives will come in the future. Downside is that they close early - 6 pm, so unless you leave the office in time, you're out of luck."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is excellent. I usually get the hummus, dolmades and the Gyro. Always excellent and the staff is so friendly! There is also a store there, so you can buy spices, canned items and frozen items for later. A true gem in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"If you are gluten free... Stop what you're doing and get on over to the Middle Eastern Deli for their GF pita. Seriously, it's that good. You'll thank me later.   Now I'd love a few more gf options on the menu, which the owner says are in the works."}
{"text":"I eat here at least twice a week, great food and great customer service.  I have a hard time ordering anything but their Greek salad with gyro meat so can't recommend much else....but it's addicting and fresh."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended, but I have to say it was pretty disappointing. Everything was OK but nothing to rave about. We had the baba ghanouj the hummus the falafel a meat pie a spinach pie and a salad. Very ordinary. I think a trip to the supermarket would pay off better."}
{"text":"The Lebanese chicken is always delicious for $11.99 Chicken breast marinated in garlic and lemon herb dressing and grilled to perfection served with Tastsiki & Rice"}
{"text":"What an adorable place, great service, great food!  The owner knows it all about winning customer's fidelity with his extremely nice customer service.  I particurlaly don't like lemonade (not a sugar fan), but the lemonade here is the bomb!"}
{"text":"The grilled eggplant sandwich is the best. Tough decision between rice pudding and baklava for dessert. Awesome lemonade.    Order at the counter, and then the service is fast and friendly.  Might have to park around the back during busier hours."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!!  Everything on the menu is awesome!  I used to travel to the Middle East for work, and this is authentic and delicious!  The owners are super nice, too :)  We usually get a mixed platter and always branch out and try a new dish.  We have never been let down!  The sweets are amazing, too :)  So glad we found the Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli!"}
{"text":"Ok, as an avid carnivore, I must say that the grilled beef is pretty damn good.  But don't stop there - and please note, i'm sticking with just the basics here.  The pita bread, the plain ol' pita bread - great stuff, especially warm.  And besides all the delicious traditional Arabic sweets (halvah, don't tempt me!!), try their unassuming butter cookies.  So good!"}
{"text":"Across the street from my work.  Everything I've had here is tasty, from the kibbeh to the falafel.  Hummus & baba ghanouj are obviously very divisive topics, but the baba-g here is the best I've ever had - so smoky!  so creamy!  The market is a great feature, too - olives & feta, lots of dried goods, seemingly out of place cookbooks from a serious called \"this bitch can...\" (e.g., \"this bitch can cook for a party\").  Not the best (or cheapest) Middle Eastern food I've had, and not the best market, but somehow the place is more than the sum of its part.  The rosewater lemonade is kind of what pushes this place into five-star territory - the stuff is DEFINITELY the best lemonade I've ever had, and hits the spot on our hot summer days."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  My first visit today and I'll be back.  Everything was so fresh!   The gentlemen behind the counter heard it was our first time and after we ordered, said \"save room for dessert\".  Before our order arrived,he brought a platter of hummus and pita bread - no charge.  After our lunch, he brought us coffee and baklava - no charge.  Oh, and the lemonade was excellent too !!"}
{"text":"This place is legit - just go, eat, and be happy. I am not from the middle east, but I am from Detroit and I would argue we know good greek and arabic food. The Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli is amazing. I had the combo plate and a meat pie and it was exactly what I was craving. The flavors of everything were on point, the people were very nice, and I enjoyed browsing the store while waiting. I will be back again and again. The only thing I did not like was that I was hoping to have leftovers but the combo plate was just one good sized meal. They also have the \"fluffy\" pita bread with no pocket, and I prefer thinner halves with a pocket, but that is personal preference, and anyway not the highlight of the meal!"}
{"text":"This place is everything you'd ever want from a mom-and-pop eatery. My husband and I are HUGE fans of the gluten-free pitas, and I buy their fresh blocks of feta when I'm doing my own Mediterranean home-cookin'. The food is TO DIE FOR (I always indulge in a rice pudding on my way out!) and the people are so sweet and nice! This place has easily become one of my favorite spots. Don't forget to try the lemonade!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful experience! My daughter was in town and she and my son and I went to have lunch here for the first time.  I don't see my daughter often, so to have such a nice experience with my kids is wonderful. The owner gave us complimentary Turkish coffee and baklava .  Besides that wonderful gesture the food was delicious and everyone there made us feel special, like we came to their house for lunch."}
{"text":"I'll preface this review with the fact that I've only been once, but I felt the portions were a bit on the small side and the prices were a bit too high. I came on a weekday lunch and it was moderately busy. I had the Lebanese chicken plate and a lemonade. The chicken had good flavor, it was a bit tart from the lemon/yogurt and seasoned well, although it was quite thin and dry, possibly because it was so thin. The rice was satisfying, cooked and flavored well. I wasn't a fan of the lemonade, although I am a fan of really tart lemonade and this one was lacking that. It also had too much of a floral note for me. My entree + lunch was around $16 before tip which is a bit too expensive for an everyday lunch. I'll probably give it another visit or two so I can try some of the other items and give this shop a fair shake."}
{"text":"Great shawarma. Bomb chicken lemon soup. Wife had a gyro on gluten free pita and loved it. Lemonade sweetened with honey, which tasted a little off until paired with food then bam that worked too. Great service, a little grocery with all kinds of yum yums. Can't say enough good stuff about this hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Can't go wrong with the kibbee sandwiches or the tabouli! Well, ok EVERYTHING is great! Love shopping here also!"}
{"text":"First time here today. Tuna sandwich awesome with really good pickles on the side, Lebanon chicken is hands down amazing! Will be back tomprrow. Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"the have gluten-free pita. GLUTEN FREE PITA! and it's soft and fluffy and delicious and they won't charge you extra for it. i actually thought they gave me the regular wheat kind the first time i had it because it's so delectable. you can also buy it by the package for something crazy like $4. that's right, i said gluten free."}
{"text":"I had a gyro plate with salad and a separate order of rice on the side because it doesn't come with both. The gyro meat was pretty good but not what I'm used to, it was super neatly made like from a loaf pan instead of the shaved look I'm used to. It had pretty good flavor but it just didn't seem super authentic. The salad on the other hand was perfect, it was an actual salad not a sad pile of iceberg mix like many other places have. Tempe has the best gyro shops in my opinion but this is an okay place, albeit a little overpriced."}
{"text":"I was looking for something different to eat by my work. I've missed good middle eastern food since moving here from California. I have to admit I didn't expect much considering how small and low key this place is but OMG! This place is great! Everything is seasoned well and fresh! I def recommend checking this place out for something different if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I grew up in Toledo, OH where Lebanese food is an art form. This is up there with the best. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious pita sandwiches and falafel. Love the hot tea. Order at the counter and they'll give you a number for your table.  This is a no frills but yummy hidden gem. We live close and will be back often."}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic middle eastern food. Try the whole wheat Pita bread. I had the lamb kebab with tabouli. Delicious! Try the lemonade as well. I would highly recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"They serve gluten-free pita here!  No review has mentioned that yet, but to anyone who loves hummus/other-dippable-Middle-Eastern-dishes but can't eat gluten, it's pretty big news and really sets them apart :)  Gluten-free, pillow-y soft pita bread.  I have a bite of it in my mouth as I type.  (They sell it by the dozen to take home, or you can order it with your meal.)"}
{"text":"Great high quality food. Baklava was pricey but excellent. Also owner very nice accommodating."}
{"text":"It's awful of me not to have updated this in a more timely fashion.  Simply put, Middle Eastern Bakery is fantastic.  Excellent food, great lemonade, superb market and low prices!  What really makes the place stand out is the service.  I'd like to share a recent experience I had.  After ordering some take out, I struck up a conversation with the owner, who was eating breakfast.  We discussed the various types of feta available, and which kind was best.  This guy, the owner, sliced off a piece of cheese from his own breakfast and gave me a sample.  That's right, he feels so strongly about his goods that he was willing to share his breakfast.  I love this shop and only wish that the hours of operation were more in line with my schedule."}
{"text":"Wonderful find, delicious food! These folks take pride in their work...it really shows in the food and service...simply superb!"}
{"text":"3.5  Decent middle eastern food, had the chicken kabob plate, not a ton of flavor but not bad, would give it another chance."}
{"text":"Whoohoo!  The yelpers got it right!!!!!!!  Delish to everything! This rice should come live with me. The gyros are my heros. Oh and try some before you buy some pita bread and pita chips. I'm hiding the cinnamon pita chips from my sister as we speak. Lemonade is made with real wild honey and these are not small cups. I'm full trying to make it through this review before I nap on the table."}
{"text":"I had a chicken Lebanese gyro. Seasoned perfectly with lemon. Very fresh and filling. Their lemonade was voted best in Phoenix so I had to try it. Very good!"}
{"text":"Awesome pita and pies! The shawrma and meat/spinach pie is great. Pleasantly surprised. Definitely a hole in the wall gem. Hard to find legit traditional ethinic foods around the area but this place definitely tops the list for middle eastern food.   Will definitely be back. Needs some upgrades with decor but that will take time."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Middle Eastern Bakery since the 1980s. Their pita bread is the best in Phoenix. Their homemade dishes and desserts are always wholesome, fresh and delicious. The owner and staff are great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So you all know I love my middle eastern food so this was a must try! My problem is I always what to try everything off the menu in these places so $22.00 later I had a feast!  The baked cabbie was good - although I prefer fried - hummus was a bit bland, rice was on the money. I had the kabob and lamb shish plate, lamb had a few fatty pieces, which is expected, and the kabob was awesome!  Worth a stop if you need a quick middle eastern fix or to pickup groceries and spices."}
{"text":"Yummy!  I had the sampler plate and loved all of the options, especially the Tabouli! I am not a big fan of this minty dish, but theirs had a little more grain which made it perfect to me. I liked the falafel balls and the rolled grapeleaves too. I definitely will be back and will try the Beef Shawarma next time. Sorry everyone, but I was not as impressed with the lemonade as it was hyped up to be."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I ordered the combo platter which consisted of roasted beef, lamb and chicken skewers, on a bed of rice. The lamb was my favorite. I recommend the lemonade! You can really pick up on the orange water that it's made with. For dessert we tried the baklava which was superb! Next time We will try it with their Turkish coffee. The nice owner or manager tried to get us some before we left but we were in a hurry. We will be back that's for sure."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried is amazing. The owner remembered me the 2nd time in. Super friendly and awesome lemonade with rose water. Def worth trying."}
{"text":"The pro's - the owner. Nice guy, proactive with great suggestions.  - falafel sandwich: one of the best I've ever had.   - the tahini used in the falafel - their house made hot sauce. Be sure to ask for it. - Greek salad - great dressing.    I was a bit disappointed by their baklava.  Perhaps I was expecting too much after enjoying everything else.  That's the only thing I wouldn't repeat."}
{"text":"I saw this on \"Check Please\" and it looked like a very interesting place. Cute little store inside with lots of Mediterranean goodies and freshly made pita bread. I had to walk around to find someone to take my order and answer my questions. Couldnt find anyone and the place was empty. Finally a woman greeted me. I asked about the Giro Pitas sandwiches and they sounded like they were kinda small so I got 2. I had to get the pita breads too. I grabbed a bag and they were still warm at 11 am. I sat down at a table where behind me there was a couple of tables that were dirty and looked like it was sitting there for a while. I received my food and it looked kinda lame. It was half wrapped on a big white plate which made the sandwich even look smaller. Usually when I go out some sort of side was given, be it rice, chips, fries, soup or a small salad. Kinda disappointing for the price. I bit into sandwich and the pita was to die for. Soooooo good. The meat was very different and flavorless. It seemed boiled and very wet. Did not enjoy at all. Usually its carved off in strips, nice and crunchy or carved and then grilled. This was wet and soft. Part of my pita was even soaked and wet. Not appetizing. Too bad. I really wanted to take my wife to a new Mediterranean restaurant. I will go back for Pitas, but that is all."}
{"text":"Food is always perfect. I'm Palestinian, so trust me, the food is top notch and authentic. Don't rely on people who are used to Americanized versions of Middle Eastern food. I had to laugh at a couple of the posts below. Bottom line--it's outstanding and worth our hour long drive every time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. First time here and I was very much impressed. I ordered the mixed kabob plate with Tabouli. Awesome! Chicken was well seasoned, cooked through, and still juicy. First time I've had Tabouli and I enjoyed it - fresh, crisp, and refreshing. The only thing I'd do without is the beef kabob. It was good, amazing spices, but a bit dry for my taste buds. Hummus is awesome, also. The owner is super nice and friendly. The lady who took my order gave me a sweet treat for being my first time there. Oh! And I've read the reviews about their lemonade. OMG! You should NOT leave without it. Sweet perfection with hints of honey and orange blossoms (I think). Great place. Definitely will be there again!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the bakery and were only here because we were in search of baklava. I was surprised that it was a restaurant as well. It seemed authentic which is also a plus. We purchased baklava and it was delicious. Each and every crispy and flaky layer was perfect. I asked the kind gentleman at the register about a particular pastry. He explained the ingredients and said it was burma. Which was also yummy. What really blew us away is that before we left the owner treated us to his award winning lemonade. It's made with lemon, honey, and rose water. What a treat! He was very proud of it and with every right. It really was amazing. We will definitely return and try a meal (the Lebanese chicken caught my eye).The place gets 5 stars from me for the exceptional customer service and delicious pastries."}
{"text":"Saw this place on an episode of Check Please on PBS. The food is fabulous! The place is quite small, very few tables, you may have to make friends and share a table. The waitress was very busy and attentive. You order at the counter from the menu on the wall. I had a combo plate of grilled beef, lamb and chicken on skewers. We had a side of spanakopita as an appetizer. The baklava was very good too. Even though it was kinda crowded and noisy, I would still highly recommend. Authentic as you can get, not to mention the many awards posted on the walls, this is great food."}
{"text":"The people who run this place are so nice!  I like to get their frozen dolmas and the last time I was there they gave me a free lemonade just because I admitted I'd never tried it. It has rose water in it and it was sincerely great. I'm so glad this place is right here in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love this little hole-in-the-wall. I've now been there multiple times. A bit interesting to find the first time, but overall a great experience. Love the baklava, and the turkish coffee. I've tried several things, (shawerma, gyro, meat & spinach pies) all of which were great! They're super nice, as well as fast (for homemade, cooked to order food). I'm interested in trying the lemonade, but haven't been back this month to try it."}
{"text":"The best Armenian and Greek food since my grandma's kitchen (and mine) and my cousin's Armenian Bakery in Los Angeles, Partamian's Bakery. The home made lemonade was also spectacular."}
{"text":"The owner here will gladly, without fail, devote time to helping each customer decide what they're looking for. Because of this the line tends to get backed up. This is just about the only downside to the place, which is otherwise amazing and staffed with some of the friendliest people in Phoenix. I highly recommend stuffing yourself to the brim with falafel, taboule and tzatziki. DO NOT leave without trying the lemonade. It's bizarre, almost jarring at first, but it'll get you hooked."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place. Prices and the food were just right, and there is no word that is worthy of complimenting the lemonade. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"There's a couple things I didn't expect coming here - for it to be a grocery store/deli/restaurant with in-store seating, AMAZING food, and the sweetest owner in the world!  There are also many GF options, including GF pita!   I had the vegetarian sampler.  Delish!  I loved the size of the falafels - they are on the smaller side of what I'm used to and they were perfect!  Everything was seasoned lovely.  I tried some of my husband's rice and I wish I had gotten a side of it, it was so moist and flavorful!  The rose lemonade was a nice touch as well.  It wasn't exactly lemonade, more like a sweet rose drink, but so yummy.  The owner was friendly enough to give our family complimentary coffee to enjoy with our desserts with!  The baklava wasn't overly sweet which was a nice change from the honey doused ones I've had elsewhere.    Only regret is we live in San Diego which is faaaaar from here, otherwise I'd be back over and over!  Also, I can't get down with the Styrofoam - time to switch to something more eco friendly!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, although it is pricy.  You do not receive a detail receipt and you do not know if you are overcharged or not. Last time we went, my wife saw some dates on the counter for approximately $4.00 a pack.  We were already in the car when my wife asked me to get her some dates.  I was charged $8.50 for 1 pack.  We both went back to the deli and my wife explained that she saw the price less than 30 mn before.  The owner denied it, refused to reimburse the difference.  Although we were going there at least once a month, we are now afraid to be overcharged."}
{"text":"Super fresh, high quality authentic food. Pitas are great to take home and the lunches and dinners are perfect portion sizes and consistently great. One of my favorite spots in town."}
{"text":"Warning: this review is going to be positively glowing. If you're not in it for the long-haul, I understand. Try this place. Try the lemonade, try the turkish coffee, try the tabbouleh, try the falafel. If you don't mind a longer review read on:   The owner, Isam,  couldn't have been more friendly, informative, generous or helpful. When he found out it was my first time at the restaurant he insisted that I try the lemonade, baklava and turkish coffee (I completely agreed) and then  *bam* he insisted that they were on the house. I was not expecting such a generous offer and I was more than happy to pay for these items myself, Isam's pride of ownership is genuinely impressive. He seems to run his business from an old-school model based on integrity, a little showmanship, and a product that truly sells itself.    I proceeded to order, Lebanese chicken and grape leaves and wait for my food. They brought my lemonade, and to be honest, I really had no idea what could have possibly been so wonderful about lemonade that I would just HAVE to try it. Well, I have three simple answers rose water, orange blossom, and honey. They don't put any sugar in their lemonade, it has this beautiful delicate floral taste, anchored by a richness from the honey. You will love it.   The lebanese chicken and grape leaves were ahhmazing. The tabbouleh is incredible and balanced to perfection. Not too much of this, or that...just right. The owner tells me that they go through about five batches per day. I believed him.   Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli was so delicious, I began snapping pictures of my food and plotting my yelp review while still in the restaurant. I began bragging via text to all of my foodie friends. I took a to-go order for friends I was meeting up with later, it seemed like a nice gesture, but really I just wanted to have an excuse to try more of their delicious fare.   Per Isam's insistence, he brought a piece of baklava and turkish coffee. The baklava was delicious. The shining star was the turkish coffee. My god. Best. Coffee. Ever. Seriously. If nothing else, go here and order lemonade and turkish coffee. You will be thrilled.   If I don't eat at this place at least once a week as long as I live in Phoenix I'm going to be disappointed. I can't wait to go back. Upon leaving the restaurant I noticed a new gyro place had opened two doors down. I actually felt sorry for them, their business is probably going to tank by proxy."}
{"text":"This place serves the best falafel I've ever tasted. Because they have gluten-free pitas, I can enjoy those in a pita sandwich, just as I enjoy their very tasty gyros.If you're really hungry, go for the plates so you can have dishes such as kifta kebab with rice, pita, and Greek salad or tabouli. It is a mom 'n pop establishment so expect friendly personal service. And to satisfy your sweet tooth, you'll probably want to take some of their delightful baklava or other sweets home."}
{"text":"Perfect local place. It has a store with a lot of goodies. I went there for dessert and coffee. The baklava and Turkish coffee hit the spot. The staff and owner are very friendly. They have been here for 51 years!"}
{"text":"THE best gyro I've ever had.   I would make a trip here just for this.  This towers over any other gyro I've ever had in my life.   It comes in \"sandwich\" form (basically stuffed into a pita).   Such a simple food, but perfectly proportioned in ratio of what's in there.  All wrapped up in a freshly made pita."}
{"text":"This is my friend's favorite Middle Eastern restaurant, and recently he did me the favor of bringing me here. We ordered the combo that gives you one of each kabab (chicken, lamb, and qofta), rice, and salad (we opted for tabouleh here), plus a side of falafel. We washed it down their lemonade (made with rose water and honey- DELICIOUS!) and finished it all up with a slice of baklava and a cup of cafe turka.  The owner was a sweetheart. I told him that I like his falafel better than my own, which is a real compliment coming from me, as I often brag about my falafel. But his are fantastic. They are the perfect tiny bites of delicious.  Also I love that this place also has a kosher/halal grocery setup right there, in case you want to chance your arm at making any of these fine foods at home!   I'll be back often."}
{"text":"Oh man. This is authentic AF. the food was amazing and the deserts were spectacular !!! Glad we stopped by this place"}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat!  We were treated with such kindness on our visit! The wonder gave us a  coffee and baklava to eat after our meal.  I ate their combo plate as I couldn't decide what to have as it all looked delectable!  They make their pita's HOMEMADE along with the hummus!  Don't MISS OUT on passing by this deli!!!  Also a MUST try is the lemonade!!!  Why???  It is sweetened with honey and rose water!"}
{"text":"How is it I haven't written a review for Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli? I eat here so much the staff knows me.   If you go, treat yourself to the lemonade, even if you don't like lemonade or have diabetes. Trust me. It's worth the spike in blood sugars. Sweet, yet not sugary.   Some of my faves: chicken shawarma, Lebanese chicken, falafel, kibbeh and the Avgolemono soup. Their pita bread is soft and tasty. I love their baklava. Just the right amounts of ingredients making it one light and delicious dessert."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome.  Seriously, color me blown away.  And add another all-star to a growing list gems along the 16th St corridor in central Phoenix.  Step inside a totally unique Phoenix establishment along 16th Street just south of Osborn and you feel like you've been transported to a small Levantine grocery store halfway around the world.  Within this grocery store you'll find a variety of hard to find Mediterranean culinary items as well as a small sit-down area for those who want to have a meal from the kitchen and/or one of the numerous freshly baked pastries.  The Yelp reviews told a pretty wondrous story about this place, but I needed to see this for myself.  I had done some research on this place through Yelp in advance, so I had some picture of what I was getting into.  I was however torn about what to get.  The grilled combo plate was my original thought being that it contained foods I was comfortable and familiar with.  But then I figured this is a Middle Eastern spot so go authentic all the way, right?  So the regular combo it was.  Kibbeh, stuffed grape leaves, falafel, gyro, and tabbouleh.  It also included hummus, baba ghanoush, and tzatziki sauces and a side of pita bread.  I also got a slice of baklava for dessert and a small lemonade (since apparently everyone says it amazing).  Total cost for the food and drink plus tip was about $16.  They had everything ready for me in about 5 minutes.  Okay, full disclosure.  I've never had kibbeh, stuffed grape leaves, baba ghanoush, tabbouleh, or baklava before.  So this really was a shot in the dark for me.  In fact I had to look up the ingredients afterwards to figure out what I had just eaten.  I won't take up space on this review explaining the ingredients, but wikipedia can sort it out for you.  The most important information I can convey is that the taste and the texture of each and every dish exuded a fresh, pleasant texture without any heavy aftertaste.    The falafel was fantastic and the tabbouleh was wonderfully seasoned.  The kibbeh, gyro, and stuffed grape leaves had just the right amount of meat and were cooked perfectly.  Every item paired perfectly with any of the three sauces they provided.  Falafel goes with anything of course, but seriously these were some versatile sauces that you could pair with just about anything.  The pita bread was warm, soft and soaked up those sauces real good.  And the baklava, oh the baklava.  Crazy delicious stacks of filo dough with a light, nutty, grainy middle.  Just the right amount of sweetness and the perfect portion.  And yes, its true what you've all heard.  The lemonade is amazing.  They say its all natural with orange flower water.  Sure, okay whatever.  Whatever it is, keep doing it.  By the way, the small lemonade size is closer to a medium in reality (not that I was complaining).  There isn't a single thing I would've changed about my meal here.  Everything was spot on.  The flavors were superb.  The staff was friendly.  The price was right.  And I left satisfied, full, but not uncomfortable.  I can't wait to try all the other goodies on that menu and all the tasty pastries in that display case.  And hey I might even buy some grocery items here sometime.  A quick tip, park behind the restaurant.  There's a gated lot in behind the restaurant with plenty of space so you don't have to jostle for one of the very few spots up front.  One you're parked, walk in and let your taste buds run wild."}
{"text":"So yummy and delicious. Fresh food and great baklava and coffee! But the real treat is the owner who is such a nice guy and takes really good care of you! Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Place has gone down since the owner isn't really around employees are just sitting and laughing and don't care about workers found a hair in my food very nasty cashier really didn't care!!!"}
{"text":"So I went here for lunch and I gotta say I was very pleasantly surprised.   I was really in the mood for middle eastern food and searched on Yelp for locations. When this one came up I was intrigued so I decided to check it out. When I arrived I was a little concerned as it was a convenience store looking place rather then a restaurant but one side is dedicated to the food. I ordered falafel balls with Hummus as well as the Shewarma.   The falafel were great!! Very well done and tasted great dipped in the hummus. The Hummus was a bit greasy but thats ok...reminded me of the real stuff! :) The shewarma on the other hand was mediocre. It is very hard to find good shewarma that is prepared right and sliced right. This was more bits of Chicken (Which is not the traditional meat) that were marinated then stuffed into a pita.   I would come again and try the Gyro and I'd have the falafell again in a heart beat. Their Pita bread is baked fresh there and is delicious...you can also grab a bag to go if you want fresh pita.    Overall not a bad lunch spot....I have yet to find a great Shewarma place in the US, but the search is still on."}
{"text":"Really amazing customer service they were very friendly!!!  I had the beef gyro with humus inside! It was huge!"}
{"text":"Great place! The ambiance was very comfortable and felt authentic. You dine in the middle the deli surrounded by baked goods, meats and canned delicacies.  I don't remember the names of the things I ate but their rice was moist and delicious, the pastries were excellent and the meat was too."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Very small little shop/bakery but so good.  I found the hostess very helpful and polite.  She told me how to enjoy my baklava with Turkish coffee.  The pita bread is phenomenal."}
{"text":"This is a solid little bakery/deli. If you know me at all, you know I love my Middle Eastern food and I love little Middle Eastern places like this. So, without being biased, I'll list what was good from this particular spot:  Great lemonade which is accented by orange flower.  Great falafel! Yes, the falafels here are wonderful and bite size!  Great pitas. A little on the pricey side for a bag of them, but I've been eating them all week and I don't feel like I wasted a penny.   **They also make their own pita chips dusted with za'atar! Those with some labne would be scrumptious!**  Good shawerma, got a pita sandwich with tahini and was pretty pleased.  Okay hummus. Definitely not the best I've had, but much better than the plain stuff you might get from a super market.  I'm definitely going back to try more! Next on my list are the spinach pies, their labne and their fresh pitas covered in za'atar."}
{"text":"Such a bummer - I had high hopes but I just didn't think the food was very good. I had the chicken gyro and it was pretty bland. Got my hopes up with seeing the lovely pitas that were on display but found it to be rather dry and tasteless.   The lemonade though, is pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing felafel and extremely friendly service. The lemonade is ok. Not sure what the hype is about. You can tell they use honey in it which adds a unique taste to it. Also took home some baklava which was very good. Next time I'm craving some good middle eastern food I'll be coming here."}
{"text":"Great service.  My son and I went for our first time and they bought us lemonade.  It was fresh and fantastic.  The service was wonderful... continually offering us refills.  My son got the hummus with gluten free pita and a gyros on GF pita.  The pita bread was so good I bought a pack to bring home.  For only $3.50 my husband and son have had 24 sandwiches.  12 slices of pita makes 24 pita pocket sandwiches!!  Great deal!  I ordered the vegetarian combination was enjoyed everything I ate."}
{"text":"Isam, owner, is so friendly and helpful. I would go back just to support him. It helps that the gyros are delicious, the pita is fresh and soft. Lemonade just might have an addictive ingredient in it :). I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Gluten-Free! Yes that is right, they have GF pitas and meat pies and spinach pies and tabouli. They are all delicious. What is great is that the pitas fresh are just as good as non-GF - so unlike most GF breads you don't have to toast them for them to be tolerable.  They also have this very thin round bread thing that we have started using at home to make a pizza roll-up. You can buy all the GF stuff (minus the tabouli) and freeze it safely with out damaging the quality. You just use a toaster or a toaster oven for a new seconds to thaw. These folks are kind and their food is lovely."}
{"text":"The store is neat, the food was yummy, and the service was good.  The only down side was another patron that had no idea how to act like a decent person.  Would recommend :)"}
{"text":"Been going there for 20+ years.  Still great food.  We went there on a Saturday evening for Falafels and feta.  The owner had a fresh tray of Falafels made for us.  She told us to freeze them before we fry them.  Thank you for that tip.  She also explained the difference between feta cheeses and how we wanted French feta for our hot dip because it melts the best.  They were really busy and she took time to share all of that with us.  Oh and the Falafels, fresh pitas and dip were awesome!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and definitely wasn't disappointed! Waited a little while for my food but hey! You want good food right? Must be doing something right! I ordered the kabob with lamb, beef and chicken. The rice was like no other. Lemony and really good. I've been had middle easter food but damn, I will definitely tell all my friends about it and recommend anybody. I want to go next time and try something different. Oh and yeah the hype is real about their LEMONADE!"}
{"text":"I love this little bakery! One first looks, you might not think much of it. And honestly, if you don't have any experience with Middle Eastern food, you might get lost in the food aisles. But for my friends with Middle Eastern or European descent, you will feel right at home. I almost cried when I found Turkish coffee, which I haven't had in almost a year since the last time I went there. I even found feta cheese pita bread that tasted just like something my Anneanne would whip up at home. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love going here. I am a huge snob when it comes to Middle Eastern food, especially pita and hummus. This is the only place I will buy pita. The market itself is a little small, but they have everything you will need including fresh made and flash frozen food to bring home.   If you have time I recommend sitting down and eating. The staff and owners are incredibly friendly. The food is amazing and good portions. Whatever you choose to order make sure you also get some lemonade because it is the best you will ever try."}
{"text":"I ordered the lamb kabobs and the shishk kabobs. I also ordered the lemonade. The kabobs were edible but entirely devoid of flavor, the lamb was better than the shishk. The rice that came with it as well as the salad was very good, flavorful. For food I would give them 3 stars, but the lemonade was worth 5 stars. Thus the 4 star rating. The atmosphere was meh. The lemonade is what it's all about."}
{"text":"Fresh Pitas, best falafels ever.   Casual place, but they make their own pitas and everything is made fresh. Best falafels I have tasted in the valley. They have spicy sauce which you can ask for. Very flavorful and goes well with all the food.  For desert try their birds nest or baklava. I also am fan of the Halva.   My go to place for middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Our very first visit and I couldn't be more pleased! Excellent food, very friendly owner and staff. I can't believe I've lived in this area for three years and have only just now discovered it. If you like middle eastern food don't miss this little gem. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best Falafel pita in town with the best falafel in it!   Name name says Bakery and Deli, but it is really a cafe with a market.  The menu is posted on the wall above the counter you order at, it has many items plates, pitas and more.   I went with my middle eastern usual, a falafel pita ($5.49) It comes stuffed in a round 6-7 inch pita with some hummus, tahini, lettuce a tomato slice and some onion. The real star here is the fresh crunchy, small falafel balls that are moist and packed with flavor. The hummus completes this flavor package while the tomato onion and lettuce are just along for the ride. The pita is soft and fresh..  My only complaint is at 5.49 is it about $1 more than a good value.   My coworkers went with a few different plates that included chicken, rice salad and a pita, they also enjoyed their food.  When we left there were no free tables so get here before 12."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They food is fresh and authentic, and there are many choices for people of all diets, including many options for vegetarians like myself. Try the Greek salad, it is incredible and the dressing is so good! The market has great options, like gluten free pitas and a variety of hummus options. This place is definitely one of the most authentic Middle Eastern options in Phoenix, and the owner is so friendly and personable. The whole staff really goes out of their way to make it a great experience."}
{"text":"Small and perfect. The falafel pita is so good. Great price. Great food. The lemonade is pretty fantastic. Always friendly service. Put it all in your mouth. You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I had a lovely experience here. I ordered a falafel sandwich along with the lemonade all the other reviews are raving about and I sat outside on their peaceful patio. The falafel was one of the best I've ever had and the homemade hot sauce was very good as well. After lunch, I also tried their Turkish coffee and baklava, and both were absolutely delicious, highly recommended!! It was the perfect end to an enjoyable and tasty lunch. If only I lived here, I would have looked deeper into their grocery section and stocked up on a few things. Anyway, the staff was sweet and accommodating and the owner was personable and such a pleasure to speak with. I wish I was able to make it back to have some more coffee and baklava and try the Lebanese Chicken plate. I'll just have to come back next Spring! Thank you for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"What a cool little store and deli. They have lots of really interesting imported foods like a spread made out of Halwah that is a great alternative to Nutella (not that I would ever give up Nutella). The best part is that they have really good gluten free pita bread. Really, really good. Almost indistinguishable from the regular kind. They have meat pies made with the gluten free bread as well as other items, all frozen and very reasonably priced. They can make any of their sandwiches such as falafel and gyros with the gluten free pita. So thrilled!! The lemonade is justifiably well known. It's very interesting with hints of rose water, orange blossom and honey. I'm just so glad that someone has found a way to make pita bread gluten free and palatable.  Very nice and helpful staff as well."}
{"text":"Poor service, interesting selection of items nobody is able to explain to buying customers. I love the Moroccan olives and I'm partial to the babaganoush. This place has NO CLUE how to make baklava and they don't know what Kataifi is, I had to explain this dessert to a man I assume was the owner. One time we went there, the 'owner' was reading coffee grounds for a customer while we waited to order, since he was 'busy' - WTF, seriously?"}
{"text":"20 minutes to wait for a single takeout item at a non-rush time is crazy. The food is fine, but over priced for what it is. I got a chx kabob plate and lemonade, and it was over $16.00. Lunch next door at Nico's is much less. The food there is delicious, priced well, and the service is swift and kind. With the prices Middle Eastern Bakery charges, I wish they'd at least give the interior a little face lift, or clean it up a little."}
{"text":"There are too many good things to list about this amazing place. Family and I have been regulars here for years and years now and has never been disappointing. The staff is extremely friendly and the food is absolutely mouth watering delicious. You MUST get their famous lemonade with honey and rosemary. I will continue to drive here from north Scottsdale. Two big thumbs up"}
{"text":"I reecently put on a middle eastern themed party at my house with a belly dancer and arabic music. Of course I wanted the food to be as authentic and as amazing as possible to complete the evening.   To that end, I used this little gem of a place for most of my food needs. Their hummus is good and the tabouli transcends any I have ever had, there must be some magic ingredient that makes it pop with flavor.   At the last minute I needed a greek salad to feed 10-15 people. The owner gladly pulled off a tray of fresh colorful salad and gave me a great price since I had purchased so much food there. I also got an assortment of desserts and they were all amazing. By the way, If you go there, do try their excellent lemonade; it's not tart as they spike it with honey. So, my party was a total success and I give credit to this deli for delivering quality food that is rich with flavor and freshness."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for a few weeks now.  Phenomenal middle eastern food.   It's my favorite, and I consider myself a connoisseur of middle eastern food.  My favorite was Sabuddys in Tempe.  It's long gone now, but it's food was of similar quality.  Middle Eastern Bakery and Cafe has the freshest salads and tabouli with just the right proportions, ingredients, and dressing.  Their meats including beef and chicken kabobs, lebanese chicken, and lamb are marinated nicely and grilled to perfection.  Their humus and tahini have great texture and flavor.  Their falafel is fantastic."}
{"text":"My family and I have been visiting this spot for more than 20 years, since I was a kid. Even though it has changed ownership over the decades, the food remains consistently authentic and amazing. I don't live in Phoenix now, but this is the first place I visit when I am back in town.   I recommend the kibbie sandwich (I order 2), kalamata olives, pita bread, lebne, and wash it all down with a honey lemonade. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Absolutely LEGIT. Some of the best shawarma and hummus in the US (Zankou Chicken in LA is a close competitor). The pita sandwiches are stuffed with delicious fresh meat, traditional pickles, and tahini or garlic dressing (depending on preference). Ask for their hot sauce to help spice things up even more. And the Jasmine infused lemonade is crazy sweet, but really good.   I love this place, and have been a die-hard fan for over 4 years now."}
{"text":"Sssooooo 1) I'm mad it took so long to discover this place, 2) I've gotta come to the spot next door (Nico's?) for dinner sometime, 3) this bought to be my new \"cop the feta and olives and all shit yummy\" spot. I came for a carry out lunch (first time ever) to discover the various feta options and other yummy delights. I never got the owners name but he made me feel welcomed and special. Super personable and gentlemenly man with a coquettish grin. I asked for one type of olive but he gave me samples of others. Looking forward to going back for dinner and more groceries."}
{"text":"I like Middle Eastern food. A lot.  We came here because of the high ratings on Yelp. My dad ordered us the vegetarian plate, a schwarma/chicken plate with hummus, tabbouleh and baba ganesh.  All of it was delish!  The lemonade was incredible and I loved it.  You must order it when you go here! We also got Turkish coffee and baklava.  The coffee was in tiny cups and very STRONG.  My mom loved the baklava as it was very fresh and very flaky.  This is a very different experience from most restaurants.  It was nice to sit and chat rather than be rushed with our meal and leave.  Clearly, those who were eating there that day were used to this very relaxed way of eating.  The owner was very nice and came over to our table to talk with us.  We learned he was from a close suburb to us, so we had a fun time talking about \"home.\"  The woman who made our food also came out to clear our plates.  We expressed our thanks to her for making such a great meal and she was very humble and sweet.  Go here!  You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Word. It's been a few years since I left the Middle East,  but it's a little slice of local in here. The chicken is indescribably amazing!  So is the shawarma and the hummus....which isn't the canned stuff. So rude, I didn't even ask her name... but the lady who helped us was super sweet. So was the bakalawa. :) I'll definitely be going back! Super glad I work down the street!"}
{"text":"5 stars for a simple market and deli with some killer good freshly prepared food.  I've been coming here for years.  I find the portions to be reasonable, and the quality of the food top notch.  Go to the counter, place  your order, and they'll call you up to do a pick up when it's ready.  Nothing like going in for a quick lunch and walking out with a bunch of grocery items, a chunk of feta, a pound of tabbouleh, and a bag of freshly baked pita breads.  I'm a fan of their food overall.  There are excellent options for vegetarians.  They also make outstanding stuffed grape leaves.  True story- during one of my pregnancies I craved these, and went twice a week to get them.  They are as good now as they were then.  There is seating here, so you can go with a small group and have lunch easily.  Don't forget to pick up some freshly prepared baklava for dessert!"}
{"text":"Came in for some of their amazing pita and left with three different coffees and a handful of sweets. I also ordered two types of pies ( feta and meat). While we were eating the owner came over greeting us and checking on the food. He asked our 5 year old if he would like some lemonade that it is the best in the world. He came back with some for all three of us and on the first sip we were blown away. The lemonade is very delicious, with no sugar, and no other lemonade will ever compare. If you are on 16th street you have to stop in get some pita, some snacks, and definitely a lemonade."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood gem offering something different.  The pita is excellent.  Warmed up with a little olive oil and they become the best snack this side of blueberries.  The gyros are also tasty and a nice and lighter deviation from the heavy Kronos variety that we see everywhere else."}
{"text":"There's a lot of good one can say about this place, but there will never be words to describe just how incredible the lemonade is.   Human language will never do it justice. It's more of an idea- a movement of energy and passion and explosions and joy and bewilderment...  Ive had an ongoing quest for dukedom at this establishment and while I'll be unsuccessful in my quest, I know that no matter what I'm still the real winner here, having had so much lemonade."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The homemade pita bread was so good. We visited while on vacation and I would've eaten here every night."}
{"text":"Don't let the look of the place scare you off.   It's a small and cramped store in a little strip mall along 16th Street right north of Thomas.  It has a small store on one side of the building and a small counter on the other side with a few beat up tables to sit at and eat.  Like I said....don't let the look of the place scare you off.   The food is excellent. Always enjoy everything I order.   The falafel pita sandwich is always tasty....some of the softest yet crunchiest falafel I've had....good stuff. Have tried the gyros sandwich too. Great flavor and their sauce just adds to the enjoyment of the sandwich.  But the hummus is what I go for. The best hummus I've ever had. Don't know what they do to it...but it's just always so rich and creamy. And has that 'nutty' flavor to it also.   Buy some of their freshly made pita bread....some fresh hummus....and you're set.  A small hidden treasure of central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a little spoiled because I lived in other major cites in the US with a larger Middle Eastern population and cultural influence (Houston, Chicago), but I found this place good...not great. The service is friendly, but the food took 20 minutes to receive... I know, good food takes time...but not really worth the wait.   I had the Chicken and Lamb plate; the lamb was good, not great- the chicken was spiced well but DRY- but not too dry that I needed to return it. I also had the Hummus- it was just Hummus, nothing distinctive or outstanding about it, The rice was bland and a little dry- needs a little more dill in my taste The Tzatziki was clearly homemade since it was a bit watery- also needs more dill and not just a cucumber and watery yogurt with little lemon juice combination. The Tabbouleh was fresh and \"clean,\" I only wish the portion was larger since that was the winner of the plate. The Baklava was very clean and crisp- she does an excellent job with the filo dough and its sweet enough for me without being overpowering.   The grocery portion of the store is lacking in variety and mostly dusty from a clear lack of any outside employees with only a huband/wife team and children on the weekends labor force is just not enough to bring this place to what the potential could be.  I might try it one more time for the Gyros."}
{"text":"So, so good! My husband and I went with friends a few nights ago and everyone loved their food. I had the Shish and lamb kabob. My husband and I were blown away that they not only had gluten free pita bread, but had a lot more gluten free options AND stuff in the freezer we could take home!  We'll be back. Often."}
{"text":"THE QUICK & DIRTY:  - 7-8 assorted tables for inside eating - counter ordering, then you get a # - moderately priced - fresh baked pita & pastries - very nice people - cool little market - very tasty food  THE LONG & NASTY:  Across the street is Rips, a local dive spot for cheap drinks, free popcorn and even freer love, if you know what I mean. Rips also has a weirdly low-extending roof that makes me wish I were 12 and had my bike with me. When you see it, you'll know what I mean.   Anyway... I've jaeger-bombed it up at Rips... several times (okay, too many times), but until today, I'd never crossed the street to the Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli.   As I sit here now by the large picture window, with my sticky, baklava fingers getting all over my new-ish iPad, I reckon I dun fucked up. This place is cool. And by cool, I mean good. And by good, I mean tasty & fairly priced.   - Had the Shawerma (described by them as \"marinated beef cooked & served with our own garlic dressing or tahini sauce\"). For $6.99, I felt the size was appropriate and the flavors were fresh, crisp and intentional. It didn't blow away my taste buds... but certainly satisfied me. The highlight was the fluffy ass pita that had been split open to hold the sandwich contents. Baked on premise, the bread was less of a chewing debacle and more of an eating occasion. Some like to gnaw. Go to Pita Jungle. Others like to eat. They'll like this place.   - Had a large Iced Tea. Another fuck-up of mine today. Shoulda had the lemonade, which apparently now are $1 per refill (still a way better deal than a free snow shovel in Africa). Tried some lemonade. BAM!! Now that stuff is deeeeelicious. Yes, with all 5 Es. Spend the loot. Accept that there's sugar. Do a little extra Crossfit or whatever you need to do to offset. P90-X?? Then have a really good life.   - Turkish coffee & baklava was excellent: sweeter than Martha Stewart after she'd been indicted for insider trading and flakier than my old roommate, Tim Tidwell, who I'm pretty sure stole my bike. No joke.   - They've got a decent sized grocery area with local (to the Middle East/Greece, etc.) olive oils, olives, grains, condiments and various frozen breads & meats. There are also many spices, teas and coffee. It's kinda like a smaller version of Baez Market. If you haven't heard of Baez, check out my review. They're only minutes away.  - Very nice people. Very! The owner's brother was filling in while he's recovering from knee surgery and we chatted about Turkey and Iran. Everyone here was warm & welcoming... I call it the anti-Mrs. White's establishment. If you don't know about Mrs. White's, it's an over-priced downtown Phx fried chicken & soul food spot. The son, Larry White, (aka \"Lolo\") opened his more famous version known as Lolo's Fried Chicken & Waffles. At Lolo's people are normal & chill. At Mrs. White's it's like being made to feel guilty as you cough up $17 (after tip) for a sloppy plate of chicken and veg, delivered to you by a grumpy employee, with no check-backs or even a tiny smile. It's insane. If you're a masochist... go take a date there... stat!  - In summary: Try Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli. It may not change your world, but it will certainly keep you smiling... which is a good thing :)"}
{"text":"This is a nice market and deli. I went for lunch and ordered the shawarma plate. I opted for the tabouli instead of the Greek salad, & I am happy I did. The lunch alone rated the 4 stars, but if you only go in there for the lemonade you are doing yourself a favor. Honey is used to sweeten the lemonade. The honey flavor meets the lemon with just the right balance. Delicious."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. I would recommend the veggie combo plate. It was delicious; as was the baklava. Market had some great offerings too including zatar pita."}
{"text":"Very expensive. Over priced items and not much of a selection for what they advertise. Too bad"}
{"text":"Stop. Hummus time. That's right. This grocery story slash eatery is a perfect for for all your Mediterranean needs. If you're looking for items to purchase and take on the go, they have everything imaginable, hummus, pitas, meats, canned goods... Just about everything! However you can also dine in an order some of their delicious homemade food. I enjoyed the chicken kabobs accompanied with hummus and a greek salad. The meal was filling and fabulous. The hummus had a lot of flavor and the chicken was perfectly seasoned. I will definitely be returning to enjoy more and take some goodies for the road."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I literally took off after work to make it here so my Wonkey and I could eat before they closed haha. Anyhow from the outside you would just think it was a Middle Eastern Bakery. I can honestly say, without Yelp reviews I would've never come in to this place.  So we ordered the Lebanese Chicken for $11.99 It came marinated in a garlic and lemon herb dressing and is served with Tastsiki and rice AND it's served with a Greek salad, Pita and rice. We didn't stop there haha we also ordered Hummus a meat pie, Falafel with tahini and of course the highly recommended lemonade (All I have to say is orange and rose water omGosh! With all of this we only paid $32.54  Everything was perfect...yes, I said perfect. From the customer service shown to us by the owners to the food. This experience is a must. We're full as heck but we're already planning to come again :-)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Feels like home, the staff is so nice and the food is delicious.  Try the Lebanese Chicken and the award winning lemonade little ice so you get more liquid heaven.  Everything here is super yummy, enjoy your visit! !!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Small 7 table deli located within a Middle Eastern Grocery Store. This place exudes an authentic old world feel. Greek music played in the background. Wall Decor is old but it fits the place like a well worn leather shoe. Patrons are locals, families and foodies  Food: Of course all the classic Middle Eastern platters and pita sandwiches (Gyros, Shwarma, falafel, baba ganoush etc) are here but the gem of this place is all the dishes that the average person has never heard/tried. Like the spinach pie: delicious, Baked Kibbie awesome. The standard dishes are great too. The chicken gyro was loaded with chicken, spice, onion, tomato and a delicious tzatziki sauce.  Service/Price: Pita sandwhich and my side dish was out in 3 minutes! Price was very reasonable.  Overall: If you down with an authentic and unique way to take in some Middle Eastern dishes, head this way!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Pita are fresh but rice tasted too much like garlic ( which is sometimes used to cover up food going bad). Got sick from the food. Will not be going again until MCC Health Dept. does a good inspection of this establishment."}
{"text":"We ordered dolmas chicken gyro beef gyro and a combo plate. The meat looked and tasted cans and every item was the worst Arabic food I've had. Not sure why this place has 5 stars, $30 wasted"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, terrific store, and some of the kindest owners in town! I am happily a regular whenever I get to that pet of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The mixed grill plate, fresh hummus appetizer and freshly made labaneh are delicious. The chicken kabob is very juicy and tender as is the lamb kabob.   Ambience is divey but who cares the food is amazing and service with a smile. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Second time I ordered to go and they didn't put any utensils in the bag. If you're going to put napkins in there than you should at least add spoons or forks."}
{"text":"Great ppl.  Tasty authentic food. Parking can be a little tough when they're busy but that just means they're good."}
{"text":"Having married into a middle eastern family and having been to the middle east a number of times, I can't say this is the best middle eastern food I've ever had, BUT, they do have the absolute best lemonade I have ever consumed. No joke.   I ordered an Arnold Palmer and it blew my fucking mind guys. Rosewater, honey, fresh lemons, and freshly brewed tea all combined to make a drink that is so epic you'll wish you could put a ring on it and a baby in it! Haha. So epic.  Ordered the Lebanese chicken and the flavor was fantastic. Perfect even. But the chicken was overcooked and tough. This dish has the potential of be amazing. The rice was solid.   Fresh made breads are fantastic as is the chill, super casual vibe. The owner and his staff are stunningly friendly and accommodating. Really great people who we are excited to continue to support.   In terms of where this one ranks amongst other Middle Easter restaurants we've tried, I'd say top 5 in the valley. Easily a top 2 restaurant if their meat was not overcooked.   Excited to go back and drown myself in their citrus magic!"}
{"text":"Delicious food (had the chicken yum!), gluten free pita and tabouli done right, kind and generous owner who went out of his way to help me when I was selecting my gluten free pitas. Loved the experience and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I tried their chicken schwarma. The price was right ($5.99), and it tasted good. I like the atmosphere too. It has an authentic Middle-Eastern look and feel, grocery store and all. I wasn't blown away by the customer service. Maybe I caught him on an off day, I don't know, but the schwarma did take a little longer than expected to prepare. I'll definitely give this place another go sometime though."}
{"text":"This is your classic family owned spot and it comes through in their service and food.  I recommend the Lebanese Chicken and Baklava for dessert. Keep up the great work Isam and Tina!"}
{"text":"1.  Order the homemade lemonade. No arguing. Just order it. Refills are only $1 so get the large. No arguing. Just order it.   2.  Shewerma was pozzuhtively deeeeelishus.  Slightly charred. Crispy edges. Try some. Buy some. Eat lots.  3.  Grape leaves were warm, melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  4.  Falafel is bite-size and I coulda eaten four or 16 of the little devils.  Lightly seasoned; coulda used a little more but, hey, I got over it.  5.  Hummus (Among us?!) was superb. Delicately seasoned.  6.  Fresh, warm, homemade pita bread was softer'n a Chanel powder puff.   Upshot?  A Mom 'n' Pop place that's sure to please and please, again and again and again and... .  Man, I'd give my left arm for some mo' lemonade, mo' lemonade."}
{"text":"I've eaten at some Middle Eastern type deli's and bakeries before and this one does not disappoint! Nestled in between Thomas and Osborn off 16th street, turn in the small parking lot with lots of painted colors on the store front windows. The store was fun to look around, definitely won't find these items at your local Fry's. I walked up to the counter to order and was greeted by a smiling man. I ordered a small hummus with wheat pita, the chicken gyro pita sandwich and a lemonade. I didn't feel like eating a huge plate of food for lunch..maybe next time? Seating is a little tight and not many tables for small parties. I was lucky to snag a small table near the dessert case and waited about 10 minutes for food to arrive. Hummus was good but obviously came right out of the fridge. Pita was good, just wished it would have been warmed up. The sandwich was also good and the yogurt sauce inside was amazing! Apparently you only get a side of it when you order a plate, not a sandwich...bummer! The hyped up lemonade is nice and sweet. As I was getting up to leave, the owner came up to me and asked if I'd like a refill on my drink. Of course! He knew exactly what I had too...very nice! I wish they had other desserts though, since I do not like baklava and that was the majority of what they had. However, I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"One of my clients recently recommended this place to me, so I went by yesterday to grab a bite before heading back in to work. I immediately felt welcomed by the owner who introduced himself, and gave me a little background info after I told him it was my first time in. He had several vegetarian meal options on the menu, which always makes me happy. I got the spanakopita plate with a salad (a real salad, not just a few iceberg leaves with shredded carrots) and a lemonade. Yes, THE lemonade! I swear it induces euphoria, it's like the perfect spring day, melted down and poured over ice. Anyhow, I saw that they serve Arabic coffee (which I love), so I ended up sitting awhile to enjoy a cup and chat with Isam (the owner), who has got to be one of the most amicable men in Phoenix (which reminds me, I must bring my Dad in for dinner). I ended up bring my bff in for coffee and treats this morning. We also got some falafel and hummus. The falafel was perfect, crispy and herbacious on the outside, and soft and moist on the inside. We left fat and happy, and with two cups of lemonade :)"}
{"text":"Everything was amazingly delicious and inexpensive. Very cute little place with a fun authentic feel! A little gem, exactly why yelp exists-to find places like this!"}
{"text":"I'm being on the generous side in giving MEBAD (as I've seen others refer to this place) 4 stars...  It's kind of a unique gem that you don't see anymore with the owner at the register and a slamming lunch business in addition to the grocery items for sale that are rare foods, snacks, and ingredients from the Middle East.   I suggested this place for lunch with Amy D today after reading about it on Yelp awhile back... so happy I finally made it there myself!  As Amy said in her review, we shared the baba ganoush and hummus plate and we each ordered a Greek Salad.  The salad was decent but nothing special, but the baba and hummus with the whole wheat pita was so damn tasty that we didn't even leave a bite.  The free cup of homemade daily lemonade was a perk and the owner was really sweet... and I really did like the flavor of it.  I happen to love lemonade!  I'll for sure return to MEBAD when I'm in the area to try more from their menu... this is the kind of place you want people to know about since you can tell how much work the owner and staff put into it each day.  If you haven't been, stop by... maybe I'll see you there - but please don't ask me to share my baba ganoush and hummus with you - I'm ordering my own next time!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now since living here a month, and I love it. The owner treats you as if you're his favorite customer from way back when. He told me proudly about the photo of his nephew graduating from the Air Force Academy as I ordered lunch, and offered me a refill of lemonade for the road when I was heading out the door. The middle of this story consists of me inhaling a falafel pita (with homemade hot sauce and pickles inside) which was better than most falafel I ate while recently in the Middle East (but not quite as good as Amsterdam Falafel in Adams Morgan...ooooh DC I miss you!!). If you want a twist on that irresistible lemonade, ask for a Terminator."}
{"text":"Love this place and the service rocks! We got there about 20 minutes before closing. The owner asked us if it was to go or for here. I mentioned that we'll just get it to go since they close soon. The owner told it would be just fine if we stayed. Love their honey lemonade!"}
{"text":"I walked into the restaurant with high hopes and high expectations after reading the reviews posted here on Yelp and I was pleasantly satisfied. I hadn't had good Middle Eastern food since I moved here from NJ, I had a great coworker who every now and then would make me Moroccan meals and desserts. Now I know where to go to get my fix. They offer food for everyone who enjoys Middle eastern cuisine, from meat eaters to vegetarians, and even have gluten free options.  I myself today asked the owner what he suggested and I decided to order that.  He suggested the Lebanese Chicken that came with a Greek salad, rice and a pita. He also gave me some of their famous lemonade as well. Now this lemonade mind you was reviewed by New Times as the best lemonade in Phoenix. Now I know why, it's pleasantly sweet and refreshing, sweetened with rose water if my taste buds serve my memory right.  My meal was delicious and filling in every aspect I wished it to fill. The Greek salad was salty and tangy just like it should be, now I'm not normally a Greek salad guy, as I'm not going to join an olive lover's guild but this Greek salad changed my opinion on olives.The salad contained pickled beets, tomatoes, red onions, lettuce, olives, cucumbers, and their dressing.  It was great, to put things short and sweet.  The pita, was soft as a pillow but tasty, unlike a pillow, don't ask me how I know a pillow isn't tasty. The pita was warm, soft, delicious and I used it to clean my plate clean after I finished my meal to absorb what remaining flavors were left behind, just so I wouldn't waste them. The rice was wonderful, it had tons of flavor, and not overpowering. They gave a large amount of it as well, which for me, a big fan of rice, mad this meal even better. The rice contained peas mixed in and I think saffron. The chicken I had was delicious as well, it was chicken breast, in a lemon and herb spice, grilled. It wasn't too salty and the flavor wasn't overpowering. All of the items in the dish accompanied each other well. All of these items together as a meal were very fairly priced too. After AZ sales tax, my meal came to $9.83.  I will definitely go again, this time to try a vegetarian option and I highly recommend you going as well."}
{"text":"The owner here is awesome. Outstanding customer service, treats customers like family. The nice thing about this place is that it has a little market, pastries, deli and serves food. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have the best lemonade in town and wonderful Mediterranean food and sweets. The deli/bakery also has a store with many foods from the Middle Eastern region. The employees are helpful. One of my favorites is the Lebanese Chicken platter. It is a generous portion and comes with a good sized salad and pita bread. Their Gyros are also wonderful as are their sweets. There is limited parking in front but there is a large free fenced lot behind the restaurant for you to park in. Be sure to check out all the take away food in the coolers."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the valley and I love Lebanese food so I was happy that a Yelp search turned up a real gem finding Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli  Pros  Friendly staff Authentic tasty cuisine  Variety of grocery items  Love the dates...they are nice plump! Baklava is super tasty Lemonade is sooooo good!  Cons  Wish they were open on Sundays but appreciate that the owner allows his staff a day of rest  Overall love Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli and can't wait to go again soon!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Wonderful People. And I hear they have the best strawberry lemonade, so now I have to go back to try that! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Great place, love the market and the bakery.  I stopped here for a Greek craving for dinner.  My friend and I got the lemonade and the meat combo dinners.    The lemonade is out of this world crazy good.  I was thinking they should sell it in half gallon carafes.  The meat combo plate was good but not outstanding.  The gyro meat was dry, but the chicken had a lemon zest about it that was pretty amazing.  The hummus was ok but the bread was like warm fresh out of the oven.  I felt like I was being cooked for in some ones home.    I did a quick tour around and found a couple of things to put on my food list and a couple for my next eating experience.  Lebanese chicken is next!  This place is a shining gem!"}
{"text":"I have had a lot of traditional middle eastern food, but this place is on its own level. TRY THE LEMONADE and the falafal is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Wonderful family run business!  Prices are great--whole meal for under $10!  Community has rallied around them after significant hate crime & vandalism. Support this place--win win. As the owner says , love always wins over hate!"}
{"text":"Always perfect: fresh and delicious food made by the sweetest people. We have been eating here for many years and recommend this bakery and restaurant to the whole world."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. I love to get lunch there, and leave with stuff to-go. They have some incredible home-made olives with different spices. I am an olive snob and can't say enough about them. You can also get hummus and baba ghanooj to go, as well as their freshly made (they are a bakery) pitas.  They also have some interesting mixes, canned beans, etc. They have a lot of Sadaf products which is cool because I used to actually mail order from them once in a while!   On the lunch side, I love all their vegetarian food and often get a vegetarian platter or falafel sandwich or plate, etc. Their tabouli is out of this world good - lots of fresh mint and parsley, lemon juice, it's perfect if you are into the Lebanese taste. I've never ordered meat there but I've seen other people order it and it looked great. The food is delicious and home made tasting. Their baklava is superb. Split some with your lunch mate.   If I were to succinctly describe their food it is fresh, healthy, authentic, and delicious.   I gave it 5 stars. Not 5 stars like a fine dining type restaurant - 5 stars because they do their type of ethnic food with unfailing perfection and authenticity and consistency across multiple visits.   Middle Eastern Bakery is keepin it REAL yo! ( blatant fishing for cool ratings!)"}
{"text":"The best pita every and baba ghanoush that is so creamy and not too smoky. Love the service and the kindness shown tone by the man who helped me. This is a wonderful family owned place that makes Phoenix so special. Amazing food."}
{"text":"Wow, I've lived in Coronado for about 6 months already and I cannot believe this is my first visit!!   The bakery had a warm and inviting ambiance and the owner Isam, is just delightful. My husband and I arrived 10 minutes prior to closing and Isam was so inviting to us. We placed our orders, mine the falafel plate and my husband ordered the Lebanese chicken plate. On top of this we ordered a large hummus plate. Hypothetically speaking if we could have ordered the entire menu we would have! Everything sounded amazing on the menu.  Alas, the famous Lemonade, we just had to try, made with honey and rosewater. I told Isam that this was our first visit and I had to try his famous lemonade, and he lit up like a Christmas tree and said \"this is your first time here?!? Lemonade on the house for the two of you.\" No way?! Ya way! The lemonade did not fail us, it was delicious!! So refreshing and the flavors worked lovely together!  Now onto our food plates....the hummus plate was delicious! They put ground beef cooked in olive oil, garlic and onions and sprinkled it on too of the hummus and boy was it delicious with the pita bread!! My falafel plate was amazing, the falafel nice and crisp on the outside and cooked and moist in the middle, it tasted amazing with the pita, tabouli and hummus together! My husband kept on raving about the chicken and how tender and flavorful it was, I had some and he had to take the plate away from me before I devoured it all! Haha!   We still had half of the hummus left and Isam came up to us and asked if we wanted an extra pita bread on the house to eat with the hummus! Uh, YAH!   Not only was the food delicious this place exceeds in the customer service department, Isam was just a delight and to give us lemonade and pita on the house, this place just rightfully owned their 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"I thought it was just okay.  The gentleman behind the counter was quite friendly, as promised by the reviews, but the food was so-so.  Perhaps my expectations were set too high by Yelp.  I like Haji Baba in Tempe better."}
{"text":"Just delicious! I got the chicken kabob and it was perfect! The meat was so moist and seasoned  perfectly and the rice was amazing. The owner is just the nicest person and the service is great! I can't say enough good things about this little hidden gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Best chicken kebab and lemonade ever! Plus owner is the sweetest man alive. You leave feeling like family."}
{"text":"With so much confidence he said, \"everyone said I have the best lemonade\" and he sure was right!   We wanted to bring back some baked goods after our vacation and found some raving reviews online for baklava.  Our quick pit stop turned into an unexpected experience learning about cardamon Turkish coffee, baklava and lemonade from the owner himself.  He was one of the sweetest and definitely knew how to make his customers laugh and feel loved.  I've tried to make my own baklava once and burned through $40 worth of ingredients.  Now I just pay the $3-4 because it is worth it.  The baklava here was good, but my favorite was the lemonade.  He mades it with orange, honey and rose water. Somehow, we accidentally poked a hole through the styrofoam cup on the way to the airport and lost some of the drink.  It was painful for me to loose those couple of sips knowing that I won't be back to Phoenix anytime soon.    It makes me happy when owners are happy and treat their customers right.  Take my money!  I'll forever miss the lemonade here."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Such nice people, it's so refreshing to find a jem like this. Plus they have the best gluten free pitas, and plan on making gf baklava! So excited! Can't say enought great things about this place! Looooooove it!"}
{"text":"Look, I have read the other reviews. I know what everyone else is saying, but I just wasn't a fan.  Lemonade: They make it fresh, with honey, rose water, and orange water. It BY FAR was the best part of my trip here.  Staff: Staff was super nice and helpful. No issues there.  Food: I ordered the combo plate. Chicken and Beef. Chicken was lemony and dry. Beef was overcooked. Rice had like 3 pieces of veggies (corn, peas, and carrots underneath). Tabouli was pretty good.  I will come back, and try their gyro before I give up on this place, but for now, 3/5 is the best I can do.  Mid Fresh on Mill Ave is still my favourite Middle Eastern restaurant."}
{"text":"Falafel!  Not quite Moshe's on Avenue of The Americas in NYC. But really really good. Crispy and Moist. We went here for lunch today. Got there at 11:30. It's primarily a grocery and bakery, there's a kitchen in the back and they have about a dozen tables. There were about 3 tables filled when we arrived but by 12:30 every table was full, there was a line at the counter and people filing into the place. We each had a different dish, and we were all happy with our meals. I am going to return here and would recommend it for lunch or take out."}
{"text":"Best lemonade I've ever had!  Definitely will not want any other after this one!  Great family atmosphere and a wide variety of middle eastern products!  The pita and flat bread are amazing and fresh!!!!  Plus they have homemade Lebanese Halawa...try the one with pistachios....which is amazing!!!  Sooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, inexpensive, very friendly neighborhood feel.  We had dinner here last night and it is the real middle eastern/greek/lebanese thing at very affordable prices.  Everyone made a real effort to make us feel welcome.  Not fancy.  Plasticware and paper napkins, but that fits this bakery and restaurant.  An old fashioned place that we would be happy to come back to when we are in the area.  The owner treated us to baklava and coffee after we had told him we saw a review of the place on local TV and gave me a tour of the olive oils they carry.  You cannot go wrong here.  Open till 7 PM, so go earlier."}
{"text":"I really like this place but wish the food was better.  Could be that it is too original or authentic for me.  The meat is always dry and the small cups of hummus and tzitzi are just small. Very nice people and appealing market. I will definitely be back for the lemonade."}
{"text":"This place has so much to offer! Talk to the owner he will guide you. If you are gluten free this is the spot where the option is just as important as the smiles. The pita is soooo good. I get 4-5 bags at a time also try the Turkish coffee with a special friend."}
{"text":"Lots of reasons to love this place:  1, the owner is kind and gracious, the staff are welcoming, and it's a small, local business.  2, their dine-in food is yummy--try the falafel sandwich and hummus! (I haven't tried the meat (because I'm mostly vegetarian) but my meat-eating friends say it's yummy too.)  3, the grocery, deli and bakery have a good selection. They make very addicting za'atar gluten-free pita chips (and gluten ones)...so good to dip into their jalapeño hummus! They also make pita chips with a cinnamon sugar topping which seem to disappear suddenly everytime children are around. They carry some unique and hard-to-find feta cheeses, spices, and jarred items (like nuts in honey). If you are having a party, there are lots of ready to serve or heat and serve items (the spinach pies are great!).  4, the omg-I'll-sell-my-mama-to-get-this lemonade! Delicious and homemade. Note to vegans--it's made with honey. It's been awarded best lemonade in the city many times by the Phx New Times...the praise is well-deserved!"}
{"text":"i seriously love middle eastern bakery. i usually get take out but every time i've eaten in the service has been great- the owners take time to answer question about the food and you can tell they care about their customers. i usually get the vegetarian platter- their falafel is the best i've had since i moved to the southwest, the dolmades are good, and their tabouli is good and not too lemony.. i've also had the lebanese chicken, which is awesome, and the gyro, which was good but not amazing. definitely order the lemonade- it's rose water and excellent!!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best places in town to eat!  It is so good I've been coming here for the last 5 years!  I LOVE their chicken kabab with Greek salad and rice. The pitas are always warm and soft and their Greek salad dressing is one of the BEST I've ever had.  The lemonade is definitely one of a kind! And I always order a side of their delicious hummus because I can't live without it!  I've come to know the staff, the owner and the cook and they are the most kind and friendly people!  Overall an AMAZING place!"}
{"text":"Just walking into this place makes me happy. It's a true mom & pop shop, and all of the food is made with love. My staples are the falafel sandwich and hummus. Both are vegan. The falafels are the best in town - fresh and not too greasy or dry. The pita is homemade and like fluffy clouds of goodness. The hummus is scrape-the-plate good.   The service is usually excellent and prompt. Sometimes too prompt, as I like to have time to browse the market."}
{"text":"I've never actually had authentic Middle Eastern food before so I have nothing to base this on, but it was delicious and filling!   Got the \"shawerma\" which seemed like mostly beef (it says beef and lamb on the menu but not having lamb before, I couldn't tell the difference), marinated and grilled, with a side of Greek salad (basically a regular ceasar salad with tomatoes, feta, and pickled turnips). It came with a side of super soft, delicious pita bread - which is baked fresh every day. I made a sort of taco with it and it was amazing.  The meat pieces weren't quite what I expected (my knowledge of shawarma comes 100% from The Avengers film so I expected shaved meat wrapped in a lefse served in foil) but it was more akin to carne - but marinated and cooked to perfection so absolutely NO complaints here. The food was super fragrant in the best way and a little food filled me up. We also got the lemonade which won the New Times Best Of Phoenix award. It's fresh lemonade with rose water, honey and orange water (?) instead of sweeteners/sugar. It has a very strong honey flavour and is almost like drinking incense. It made my breath smell great after the shawarma and was really unique and delicious. Free refills too!  Because we mentioned it was our first time, the owner offered Turkish coffee and their baklava - super delicious! The coffee comes in this cute tiny cup and has cardamom (one of my favourite spices!) in it and the baklava was super good. The filo was perfectly flakey and the honey was top quality and fresh.   All that food and drink for under $13. AMAZING.  They also have a few aisles of imported and in-house foods. I got a pretty large bag of pitas, a 16oz thing of fresh hummus and a bag of super soft \"cracker\" bread (markook? chapati? I'm not sure what it's actually called because it wasn't labeled) for under $12.   I'm super impressed with this tiny local shop/restaurant and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is simply AMAZING here! Always coming here every chance I get while in Phoenix. The owner Isam is the most humble sweet man that you will ever meet. Him and his workers make it such a joy to dine in. Everyone is incredibly sweet and friendly. My favorite would be the falafel plate and his hummus is to die for! You want good middle eastern food?!? COME HERE! you wont be disappointed!  and TRY the lemonade too!"}
{"text":"Probably the best I had. Serves fantastic, and the owner is good. Prices and food were in order, and there are no words worthy of praise."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place with a friend and we stopped in with hungry bellies. Yum! We had mixed kabob and a beef dish and 2 lemonades... Delicious! We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Awesome. Pure awesome. Food is great. Cool little place. Oh and get the lemonade. You have no choice. Don't question, just get it. Your life will change as you discover the super powers you've acquired from the lemonade."}
{"text":"Great food!!! The kibbeh and yogurt sauce were wonderful! Line was long, but service was fantastic, and with a smile. Make sure you're not in a rush when going there."}
{"text":"I really want to give 6 stars to this place for their very nice service and the food prepared from their heart with passion..   My husband and I just moved to the area and tried out this place for lunch today. They really made me say \"WOW\". The pita bread is soooo soft. All the dishes on my vegetarian sampler plate were made just perfect with great taste.   Their lemonade is so special. I'm not a big fan of lemonade as it is too sour for me but this lemonade is not sour and has very tender taste. I think they said they add rose water or/and orange blossom water.  The food here is way better than that at Beiz Market. Grocery area is kind of small but they have the right items for middle eastern cooking. And in the freezer you can find the dishes on the menu like grape leaves, pita, spinach pie, etc. so you can bring back home and eat later. They also have fresh bakery of course. We bought feta cheese pita bread.  I can tell from the food they really love food and really know how to cook.  I have a feeling I will go back to this place very soon."}
{"text":"Creeping senility: I thought I'd reviewed this place in 2005. The public area is probably about 600 square feet, but every inch is jammed with Fertile Crescent / Mediterranean goodness.  This is a bakery, restaurant, and grocery. The restaurant part of the operation has a an extensive menu of flesh-based and vegetarian options. There are plates, salads, and sandwiches. The plates (kebabs, gyros, etc,.) usually come with a decadent rice pilaf, your choice of tabbouleh or Greek salad, and tsatsiki. There are a few grilled chicken dishes, and the chicken is always moist with a nice char.  MEB&D also bottles its own spices. Not as diverse as Penzey's, but it's nice to have an option on 16th St. Hat tip to Adam M. on the olives -- they're delicious.  Dessert? They serve different forms of baklava, turkish coffee, and homemade halvah (they'll slice off a piece with a scimitar-looking blade for a sample -- impress your friends!).  Tips: - You can buy Greek tobacco soap. - The soup of the day is always avgolemono. It always will be until the mountains crumble and our love is through. Sometimes there's an excellent red lentil as a second option.  - They have great par-cooked or reheatable stuff  -- it's in the frozen section. - MEB&D is an effective and affordable option to cater a party on short notice (I've done this).  IMO the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. The components are all four-star, but the place gets the fifth for the \"park-once, enjoy-many\" experience."}
{"text":"Best Middle Eastern food in Arizona!   Entering the Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli, you're immediately washed over with the feeling of authenticity. The owners are very welcoming with the only comparison of enter your family's house after an extended leave."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant.  The owners are so delightful, kind and friendly.  I highly recommend trying their famous lemonade. :)"}
{"text":"The gyro pita here is to die for! We came out of our way one day to stop here after hearing about the lemonade, and we ended up getting the gyro on a whim. We decided to split it in case we didn't end up liking it, but it was so good we went back and ordered two more! The lemonade is very good, but very sweet. The orange blossom water makes it sweeter, but it's very unique. It's tough to find parking around the shop, it's mostly street parking, but it's worth the stop!"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying that the customer service is amazing ! The wife is so polite and the husband is so welcoming ! they always make sure you are taken care of and that the food meets your expectations. The food is beyond delicious and the prices are great ! def coming back soon and letting friends know about it ! P.S they have so many great sweets and  fresh bread !"}
{"text":"My friend Tasha and I stopped into Isam's Middle Eastern bakery just as we entered Phoenix. We were starving, so we both ordered a full shawarma plate - the food itself was absolutely delicious, homemade and fresh. The owner, Isam noticed that we were from out of town and asked us for a picture, which we were very flattered. He brought us hummus and pita free of charge but the generosity didn't end there. He sat down with us, shared many fascinating stories about his own life and travels. He then gave us both a large lemonade, Turkish coffee and baklava for free (the best lemonade either of us had ever tasted I might add). When we told him we were in town staying at an airbnb down the street, he told us to come in anytime we wanted any food - for free. He is the most generous, kind and genuine man that we have met along our travels. The environment in the bakery is amazing and all of the staff were friendly and welcoming. He sent us off with 3 tubs of hummus, tabouli, pita and more desserts. We felt right at home and will be forever grateful for this experience. Thank you, Isam and family for your kindness."}
{"text":"A cute little deli with really good and fresh sandwiches. My husband had the gyro and I had the tandoori chicken sandwich. It also has a small grocery store for middle eastern goodies and some fresh baklava. It's Halal!"}
{"text":"Good food and good rose water lemonade. I always craving for these on Monday, that they are closed."}
{"text":"So I walked in the door and ordered a falafel sandwich and a side order of hummos.  Pretty standard.  But then... but THEN... the owner, a kind older gentleman, saw my Illinois driver's license and asked where I was from.  Turns out, he used to own restaurants (including my fave) in the same Chicago neighborhood that I went to college in.  We-eird.  We really hit it off and had some nice conversation about how great Chicago is and how much we miss it (I know, I know, probably not the right audience)... and then he asked me if I had ever eaten at Pita Inn.  Um, HAVE I?  HAVE I?  Um, yes, I used to be addicted to Pita Inn, thank you very much.  The best hummos in all the world.  He said, \"We have very good hummos, but ours is second only to Pita Inn.\"  An honest man.  I appreciate that.  Then he proceded to give me all types of freebies, \"You should try... Oh!  and this... and this...\" I heart Chicago solidarity.  Enough gushing.  Their food was delicious.  Really good.  But the SERVICE was second-to-none.  Thank you, midwestern nice and Middle Eastern Bakery."}
{"text":"I've only had the falafel and the amazing lemonade with rose water. It's refreshing and simply amazing during hot summer days!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food at this restaurant. I work a couple blocks away and my coworkers and I get this at least once a week. I always order the Lebanese chicken and sometimes order a side of falafel. They are both amazing! The salad dressing for the greek salad is so good, the rice is unlike any other rice I've tasted and the Lebanese chicken is seasoned perfectly. The lemonade is also the best lemonade I've ever had and definitely doesn't taste like most lemonade. If you're in the area, definitely stop by and check this place out! It is an amazing local restaurant, store and bakery!"}
{"text":"literally behind our house, we are lucky to have such an amazing little shop so close. whether its for the lemonade, the gyros, spices and pitas for home or the freezer section with dips/ sauces, everyone should stop in here at least once. this was the first meal i had in my neighborhood when we moved in 5 years ago, before we were even fully unpacked- and we have been coming ever since. the owners are fantastic and if you are the type of person who is worried you wont know the menu, they will talk to you about anything (unless its super busy, of course)  my only possible complaint is that they aren't open all day, every day :) sometimes you need that pita at midnight, yknow? hey, cant blame em, they have to sleep sometime"}
{"text":"You don't go to a place called Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli for ambiance. You go because you've heard about that one item that people can't stop talking about. I'm here to review that one item: The Lemonade.  As I walked up to the counter to place my order, I was greeted by an older gentleman I can only assume was the owner of this establishment. As soon as I told him I had heard good things about the lemonade, without even skipping a beat, he replied, \"It's the best in Phoenix.\" I cordially laughed. He did not. With a very straight face he pointed to the wall behind him. There were about five plaques given out by various periodicals and city magazines going back eight years. All read \"Best Lemonade in Phoenix\".  My chicken gyro was so-so. But you better believe I ordered about a gallon's worth of lemonade. And it definitely lived up to the hype. With hints of rosemary and mint, this lemonade stands alone.  My suggestion: Go here in between meals. If you want some midday refreshment, it does not get any better than this lemonade."}
{"text":"Delightful experience - Appears to be family owned and operated. The woman who helped us was genuinely warm and smiley- her daughter was so sweet- heard me quietly tell my boyfriend I wanted baklava and she was all excited to get some for me.   The food was great- and we were excited to have gluten free pita bread , gluten free tabbouli made with quinoa, babaganouj and lentils and rice. The market had an array of Lebanese and middle eastern goodies. The freezer had frozen homemade gluten free feta pies and other deliciousness.   Also- that baklava was darn good. I am happiest when the food is great - home made - and the people running the restaurant are happy humans."}
{"text":"This is our first time here. Let me just say, this place is so inviting as soon as you walk in. It has a feel of a neighborhood spot, everyone seems to know everyone.   The menu looks amazing. I wished my pockets were a little deeper because I really wanted to buy more than one dish. The older gentleman behind the counter heard that it was our first time in his shop and immediately told us that our lemonades were on him, he refused to let us pay for them.   If you ever come in here, you mustn't leave without trying the lemonade. They put an amazing, fresh twist on a summertime classic. Food review will soon follow."}
{"text":"I'm Baklava in Americaaa, and couldn't wait to get back to Yelping once I got wind of this place! It was a perfect lunch experience and instantly inspired me to get my reviews rolling.   Immediately upon entrance the owner greeted us with the warmest welcome and sweetest smile. He knew we were first timers so he took his time going over everything on the menu in detail. Can't say it made our decision making process any easier though, considering he described each option as being \"THE BEST IN THE WORLD!\" But I loved it. He had full confidence and enthusiasm about every single thing he served,  and it showed.  I would have to agree that the lemonade and baklava were the best around. Don't get me started on the fresh falafel, with a side of special spicy sauce, omg. The chicken was cooked to perfection, and the hummus and pita bread definitely hit the spot. The meal most certainly impressed me, and the grocery corner was a nice touch. But my very favorite part of the meal was the part where he treated me (and my lunch date) like royalty. He was out to make sure we had an exceptional experience and showed us the kinda service that you just don't see much of these days.   He welcomed us with a smile and we left with an even bigger one, as he was sure to check on us on the way out. Definitely worth a go! Go, go!"}
{"text":"YUM! What more can be said!? Need to come here more often! Lunch is a great portion, but by far the pitas are my absolute favorite."}
{"text":"God, I feel bad for this but the food was just REALLY REALLY not good.   I waited for 20 minutes for my food, (which is fine for bomb food). I took the food home and ate it with my boyfriend and the food was SO lackluster.  It was almost on par with mall food court food.  I feel horrible saying this because everyone who worked there was incredibly sweet. But that is the only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1.   HOWEVER, I really liked the market.  Additionally, I like that they make large quantities of food and put them in the freezer so that one can buy them in bulk and heat them up for parties at home. THAT, is fantastic.   The Market is great, the food is 'meh'."}
{"text":"Nothing I could say in this review could possibly convey the amazing experience that we had here at Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli.  This was THE BEST place at which I have eaten in all my visits to Phoenix (off and on annually over the last 10 years) and I will be back (multiple times) every time I visit from now on.  Why is it that the taste of the food is so often inversely proportionate to the fanciness of the restaurant, at least when it comes to ethnic restaurants?  The fancier the decor in an ethnic restaurant, the blander the food.  Stated differently, what is it about the mystical siren's call of the hole in the wall ethnic restaurant?  Does the chef assume that because his food is head and shoulders above the rest that he needn't waste money on decorations?  Or is it simply that the mom & pop chef with his traditional recipes handed down from generation to generation will never be matched by the cookie cutter american culinary school education?  This restaurant is very unassumedly named The Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli, though it is also a restaurant and grocery store.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, nor the inside, and would probably fly under most people's radar if it was not for word of mouth passed through Yelp.  Can you see the diamond lurking under the layer of carbon?  I sure can.  The proprietor, Isam (yes, we're on a first name basis now and you will be, too, by the end of your first visit), is quite a character guaranteed to put a smile on the face of even the WORST sourpuss.  Before our first visit we called him by phone to make sure the restaurant would be open when we arrived and he was friendly and welcoming.  When we finally arrived he welcomed us like old friends.    I ordered the grilled combo and my coworker ordered the Lebanese Chicken.  Both plates came with a choice of Greek Salad of Tabbouli with a fresh warm pita and rice.  I wasn't sure which to choose, so Isam guided me gently toward the Tabbouli which he makes FRESH 5 TIMES EVERY DAY.  Yes, you can tell this man is incredibly gifted in the making of Tabbouli, which is a thing of beauty, colorfully decorated with red and green pepper rings, white couscous, tangy red tomato, crisp white onions, and ruby toned sliced beets over dark greens.  It is beautiful, but tastes even better.  I ordered a diet soda in spite of the prominently displayed Yelp tip recommending the lemonade (\"Your life will change as you discover the super powers you've acquired from the lemonade.\") as I'm not usually a big lemonade fan.  My coworker ordered the lemonade and I ordered the birds nest baklava with glistening green pistachio pieces covering the top to eat while I waited for the food to arrive.  My coworker took one sip of the lemonade, which is made with honey and rose water - SHEER GENIUS - and couldn't stop talking about how amazing it was.  I traded him half of my baklava for a taste and couldn't BELIEVE how amazing it was - TRULY LIFE CHANGING.  Isam brought me a large cup of this elixir of the gods and made my entire day.  When our meals came I was thrilled with my perfectly seasoned kebabs with three kinds of meat -  chicken, lamb, and spiced ground beef, all of them cooked perfectly and all of them delicious.  The rice was not basmati, more like a pilaf, but was incredibly flavorful.  Alex said his Lebanese Chicken was amazing, but refused to share any with me.  The owner brought us over a complimentary Turkish coffee, a lemonade, and a pistachio baklava - all amazing!!!  Isam also gave us a lesson in appreciating coffee.  He taught us how to sip it and about his secret ingredient (cardamom).  He grinds his own cardamom fresh from the seeds, which cost $100 per pound and I guarantee you are totally worth the expense.  He showed us both the seeds and the ground versions and let us smell them, pure heaven on Earth.  Isam says that the cardamom works on your nervous system to relax you;  I certainly felt relaxed when I left, but I think some of that might have to do with the owner's charm rather than the coffee.  When we left, we stopped up at the counter to say goodbye to our host, because it just felt more like a family visit than a restaurant visit.  You can just walk out of a restaurant, but you don't walk out on family without saying goodbye.  I made a return visit several days later and not only did Isam remember me, but he came out from behind the counter to give me a hug and asked where my friend was (I had just dropped my coworker off at the airport).  I ordered the Lebanese Chicken and one of his heavenly lemonades.  Isam once again brought me a Turkish Coffee (this stuff is addicting) and a baklava to enjoy with it.  I enjoyed my second visit as much as my first; Isam gave me a menu and invited me to come back again during my visit.  He even gave me his phone number and told me to call if I needed anything.    I will definitely be back!!       Relaxes you, works on your nervous syst"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves solid Mediterranean dishes. I ordered the vegetarian platter, a large lemonade and the bird's nest dessert. Totally delish.  I will definitely go back to try their other stuff. The staff is friendly and eager to explain ingredients and preparation.  Has a nice family run type vibe - The owner said they have been in business for 38 years now. Good for them!   Pity they're not open on sundays. =P"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch today and had the schwerma pita sandwich. Not a bad sandwich at all. Overall, a fine experience. Not going crazy for this place but I would come back here. Check it out if youre in the area and craving some pita"}
{"text":"For a small location this place is big on variety.  First let me say, they have the best lemonade in the WORLD! Seriously, they make it with Rose Water and it is fantastic. As I waited for some goodies I noticed it on the wall and decided to try it. I didn't try it till I was driving away and almost turned around for another large one to go. But I'll be back often so I didn't. Everything on the menu looked wonderful as did the food I saw come out to other patrons waiting. I took away some Pistachio Halva which my grandson like almost as much as I did. Some Walnut Butter Cookies and Birds Nest Baklava (Out of the World Yummy.). I didn't share when I got home. I wish I hadn't eaten lunch before I went there.  I did make a smart move and I tried the Bulgarian Feta. Not your normal grocery store Feta. This was so smooth, crumbly, flavorful and had a very delicate flavor due to being made from Sheep's milk. I used it to stuff meatballs and they were outstanding. To be honest I will not have a problem, ever, driving there for that feta all the way from Mesa.  It's a destination that is worth a long drive. Don't forget to shop for some of the other items they have. So many unique things to drool over."}
{"text":"When I walked into the place, I was really happy about everything even I have no idea what kind of food they have. This place have part store and part of food place and also have neckless. I was asking the lady what should I order and she told me I should order something call kadba, I don't know I spell it right or not but it actually taste really good. Only one thing I don't like is the price. I wasn't expect it will cost me that much with lunch with drink. Anyway, if I making ok money and work around there, I will go there a lot."}
{"text":"Went in on my lunch break. I was surprised at how busy it was but didn't mind waiting at all. I had the lemonade, spinach pie and baklava. The lemonade is GOOD. Kinda on the sweet side. The spinach pie was interesting. It wasn't bad at all. And the baklava was so delicious! I thought it was pretty pricey but it was very good."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Phoenix and have only been able to try a few Middle Eastern places but this is the best place I have been to. They make their own pita, falafel, and hummus, and they are all delicious. I always get the vegetarian sampler which comes with spinach pie, tabouli, baba  ghanoush, dolmas, falafel, hummus, tzaziki, and pita. The lemonade is very good."}
{"text":"The ladies from my office brought me here for lunch. They raved about the lemonade so I had to try it....I must confess though, I am not a lemonade fan. Honestly it was like nothing I have ever had before. It was so good! The food was good and reasonably priced. It definitely had a warm family feel to the place. The market carried gluten free pita bread which I thought was a rare find. Overall I give this place a 5 star review. If you go, do try the lemonade, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Isam (the owner) went above and beyond for me and my girlfriend. I ordered the Gyro Plate, a meat pie, and an Arnold Palmer for my drink. The gyro meat was very tender, not dry, and delicious. The meat pie was flavorful and spicy. Isam gave us complimentary baklava and Turkish coffee which finished the meal perfectly. I definitely will be back to try their chicken kebabs. This place is great and the service was superb."}
{"text":"Purely authentic food. Very tasty, wonderful atmosphere. I have yet to dive into their full offerings, but this will be a regular rotation for me."}
{"text":"1st off: I'm reviewing the restaurant, not the store.  The food was exceptional in my opinion, and the staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went in to support this local shop after hearing the news. So good and so glad to have vegan options. They have a jalapeño hummus I'm going to go back for too!"}
{"text":"Since they have extended thier hours (requested by patrons who travel cross town for the food, its that good) it is so much easier to get food here. This place is awesome for so many reasons! First off the owner welcomes everyone! He is the sweetest guy ever. He is from Isreal and always has something new to tell me about his food and back home. I usually do take out here because it is my I don't want to cook/I have a cold/I want to pig out but not on junk food comfort food. They have a lemon soup that always makes me feel better when I'm sick. They have great gluten free options. The owner told me he sold out of the gf pita once because a place in California ordered his entire batch in one day, you can not tell it's gf, it's great! My boyfriend is addicted to the red pepper hummus. Some of the best baklava I have ever had. Just a great and welcoming place to have in my neighborhood. The outside is kinda dingy and the stock shelves need more frequent dusting, but it's family owned and they are truly here for us."}
{"text":"This was my first time here after months of driving by and wishing I had time to go in.  I absolutely love it. They have a refrigerated section in the market area with pre made dishes ready to take home and heat up which is super convenient! The rest of the market is full of middle eastern treasures that might be difficult to find anywhere else. I bought a box of rose flavored Turkish delight that I'm pretty stoked about.  At the counter there are olives and fresh feta to buy among other delicious things.  I loved that the owners family was there working. Very happy and hard working.  I stopped in today solely for some fresh baklava and a cup of Arabic coffee and my mind is blown away. By far the best baklava I've ever had and as the owner assured me, the coffee is amazing!!  I can't wait to come back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great food! I had grilled chicken, my husband had shawarma with their lemonade - both excellent. Tea and traditional baklava was good. I'm less enthusiastic about the baklava dessert with vermicelli - it had an off flavor.  Staff was helpful and pleasant."}
{"text":"get their veggie combo.  great place to buy feta and olives!  the rosewater lemonade is so refreshing!  sweet owners!"}
{"text":"Get treated like royalty.   If you love delicious Mediterranean food and great customer service this is the place for you (and me for that matter). The menu is simple, fresh with flavor and plentiful.   I almost always get the vegetarian plate, not because I'm a vegetarian but because it has a variety of things I love to eat.   It includes stuffed dolmades, tabouli, hummus, baba ganush, tzatziki and pastry stuffed with spinach. All of that on one plats and you also get freshly made pita bread which I  believe is baked on the premises.   One of my lunch companions has a food allergy, and not the first time while dining at this establishment. The owner stopped by and checked in on her to make certain everything came out alright. She had the grilled chicken on top of salad minus the cucumber.   Don't forget to grab a lemonade flavored with rose water to pair with lunch. It's refreshing and delightful.    When you're in Phoenix and near 16th Street & Earle, seeking out a lunch suggestion, why not give this place a try."}
{"text":"Not bad but not particularly great either.  I continue to be disappointed by the middle eastern food in this town.  I stopped in at lunch on a weekday and waited in a very long line.  The place was hopping.  I ordered a $7.99 combination plate which featured hummus, baba ganoush, shawarma, falafal and tabouli.    Alas, it was merely adequate.  First of all, the portions were miniscule, even for lunch.  The hummus and baba were served in little plastic ramekins (i.e., ketchup cups).  This is a bit ridiculous in and of itself - I mean hummus is not exactly a high food cost item but more to the point, neither was particularly tasty.  The baba ganoush was watery and lacking in flavor and the hummus was nothing special with no detectable garlic.  The shawarma was exactly two thin strips of meat.  Four small falafel balls. And of course one small piece of pita bread.    I asked for more bread and they brought another piece, but I'm always baffled by American middle eastern restaurants that serve you one piece of pita bread.  This cuisine traditionally calls for copious amounts of bread and one piece of bread just doesn't cut it.  So summing up, bland food and small portions do not a memorable lunch make."}
{"text":"100 percent authentic dining experience, I felt like I was in  another country.  My shawawma pita had very good flavor with just the right spices.  The hummus was good, but I prefer the hummus of Pita Jungle to be honest.  Can't wait to go back and try more items menu looks great.  Keep in mind this is a deli, not a fancy restaurant, so you order at the counter and dine on small uneven tables.  Good lunch spot.    Everything in the deli/store looked very good with some unusual items."}
{"text":"Great food but really slow. All of the meats are really good. The chicken has a perfect marinade. The salads are good but nothing that will knock your socks off. The lemonade is a must, as it is sweetened with real honey rather than sugar.   Wait: 1 Service: 2 Food: 4 Atmosphere: 3 Overall: 3"}
{"text":"Simple & delicious middle eastern food, fresh pita & amazing arabian coffee...an institution!"}
{"text":"Still love it...too bad I'm so far away now, don't frequent it as often. GREAT place for lunch! :)"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch and it was so delicious. I had the shawarma pita sandwich and my roommate had a kifta pita sandwich and both were delicious. Followed it up with some of their homemade baklava and we were set. The owner is so friendly and pleasant, his greatness is matched only by the food. They also have a lot of market style goods, snacks and refrigerated foods for people looking to take more home. Absolutely thrilled with this place and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Get the lemonade and the schwarma with tabouli served with pita (all house made). You cant go wrong!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and extremely impressed! The staff was friendly, the food was fantastic and prices were awesome. I took my food to go and was still blown away. I will be back! Have to try the baklava and lemonade"}
{"text":"If you crave authentically delicious Middle-Eastern food - look no further!  Patron of 10+ years...I recommend this resuraunt/grocery to everyone I know. Their food is deliciously fresh. Their service is warm and attentive. Best of all, they offer unique ingredients and prepared products to help you explore these exotic dishes!"}
{"text":"Best fresh baked pita bread ever!  If you're looking to have an amazing falafel pita, this is the place to get it.  You can grab a quick lunch here and eat at one of their little tables outside, or you can grab some food to go.  They have a great selection of olives, cheese, salads, falafel, baba ghanouj, hummus, stuffed grape leaves and much more.    If you're looking to prepare a Middle Eastern recipe, you can probably get the majority of your ingredients here. They have tons of imported spices, and lots of cookbooks too if you need help deciding what you want to make. They also sell cool Middle Eastern mixed music tapes and CD's, as well as little knick knacks for your kitchen.    The sandwiches aren't huge, but they're tasty and the prices are fairly reasonable for what you get.  Definitely give this place a try if you're in the mood for delicious, authentic Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"My favorite is the kibbie and a lemonade! Everything I've ever ordered here is amazingly good. People are so friendly and even if it's your first time, you'll feel like family. Good prices on ethnic grocery and fresh humus and gluten free pita.  Voted best lemonade in Phoenix. You'll love the rose-honey infusion."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall. Nice quite little dining area with several tables inside small market. Tried the lemonade made with rose water and it was good. I had the Lamb kebab plate with rice and Greek salad. The meal was good. The salad had a nice lemon and EVOO based dressing and the rice wasn't too oily with nice flavor and peas. The lamb was a good amount and had nice flavor and was tender albeit a little over cooked. There was a nice warm pita with the meal as well. Overall a perfect lunch before heading to the airport. They also had some great looking sweets which I wasn't able to sample."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I just rediscovered this place today after not stopping by in years. Its under new ownership now (past 2 years or so). The food was so delicious! I'm Middle Eastern and know good Middle Eastern food. This was hands down some of the best in the valley. The falafel was Perfect: crunchy outside and moist inside- so flavorful. The Grape Leaves were some of the best I have EVER had. I am typically not into grape leaves but this place has made me fall in love with them. The hummus was so good, tastes like its just been made fresh for you to order. The bread was amazing too. Nothing like fresh from the oven hand made Arabic bread- I could live off of it alone... They are known for their homemade lemonade so I had to try it. Delicious! Naturally sweetened with honey and made with rose water- very unique flavor that put a whole new twist on Lemonade. - A Must Try. It hit the spot after a long day rock climbing in the sun :) After such a delicious meal I also had to try some of their homemade baklawa. I'm not usually into desert but couldn't pass it up after such a great dinner... It was so good! Tasted like it had just been made that day- light fluffy, not over sweetened or too filling. I had it with some traditional Arabic coffee- such a great finish to a great meal... after trying it I ended up buying 8 more deserts to take home for my  family to try too :)  This place is fantastic. I am so happy I found it today. I love good Arabic food but it is often hard to find in Arizona. This place is diamond in the rough and definitely worth stopping by... The food was definitely spectacular, but I think one of the best things about my whole experience here was the service. Esawm, the owner, showed one of the most beautiful things about the Middle Eastern culture- their hospitality. I came in 2 minutes to close (not ever even realizing) and I was graciously ushered in and welcomed. I sat down for dinner and received great service and conversation. I was treated just like I was family. Since it was my first time at the Bakery since the new ownership, I was even given my dessert and coffee complimentary! I got a chance to meet and talk with all the staff and everyone was so nice and friendly. I love mom-n-pop places.  All in all this place is great and I strongly recommend it. I know I will be back very soon- probably within the week- my new favorite place to eat! :) I was so impressed with this place that I plan on having my wedding catered by them.  Definitely a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"This place has really good food and one of the best, most fresh, healthiest version of a gyro (yet authentic) I have ever had.  Delicious felafel.  The market is fun and full of goodies.  The bakery is fresh and has delicious pita and other assorted items.  The only reason this place is not getting a five star review from me is because for the money, I think the portions could stand to be just a little larger.  But hey you get what you pay for and here you get delicious quality food albeit not cheap."}
{"text":"Great food and service. They have a variety of menu selections and tasty deserts. The business is family-owned and the staff is friendly and efficient. The establishment is a nice cafe-style setup combined with grocery & deli."}
{"text":"Good food, that's why I gave them two stars however the cleanliness was a huge red flag as soon as you walk in! Its a bit cluttered and tight in there...the initial smell was rather strange as well....but the main thing was the entire time we were eating tiny bugs were crawling on our table and flying around our food AND us....I could not take it! I thought I was in episode of hoarders, that's how bad the bugs were."}
{"text":"There's so much to be said about the importance of a business owner's interaction with his/her customers. At this place, Isam the owner beams with pride, and greets every customer with a sincere hello. The employees are just as caring and polite.  The food was refreshing, and honest. I came in expecting nothing less. This man deserves every bit of his success ."}
{"text":"4.5* with so many reviews gets me excited for a place...  I've had better gyro meat at countless places (many of them fast food)... It was like the bologna of gyro.  The tabouli was weird but had good flavor...  hummus was a notch below kroger brand  taziki was nothing special.   Also, this place is kind of a rip off. No clue how they got so many 5* reviews. Perhaps people only came for the lemonade or they come here for grocery shopping? But as a restaurant I've had more satisfying meals at Mcdonald's."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here with my friends Sherry and Brandon. The two owners (I am guessing here, but father and son?) were very friendly and attentive. I had the baba ganouj pita with lettuce and tomato, and everyone else's food looked great (a chicken pita sandwhich and amazing looking lentil soup). I was throroughly entertained by a middle eastern television show (satellite I guess?), and the great mix of locals and business people. The market section is also great- you'll find loads of bottled cooking oils, spices, pickles and other pickled veggies, canned eggplant, cous cous and pastas, as well a fridge section with nice looking prepared foods. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The best Lavash in Phoenix, hands down. Their flat breads are outstanding. Their food is great, the staff is warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Only been here once, and now I will be back every week. Thank God the restaurant/market is around the corner. Isam the owner is so nice and they have amazing Gluten Free pita! This place will be my new regular. It reminds me of back home in Dearborn, Michigan."}
{"text":"damnit.. just wrote a detailed review, but I got dropped from the network and lost it..   Fresh, Traditional, Tasty food. I will be back. Go early to beat the 12 o clock rush.  Get some lemonade.   Parking Sux"}
{"text":"This is the best middle eastern food I've ever had - the gluten free pita put it over the top.  I had the felafel pita and lemonade, and i kid you not, if there's food in heaven, this is it.  Fresh, simple, authentic, and the staff could not be nicer! I plan on being a regular here!!"}
{"text":"Since you probably don't know what to expect... here's what to expect:   Vibes: The owners are exceptionally sweet and friendly (As in, free lemonade and halva cake?! What the deuce!) There's no strong overwhelming Arab or Israeli influence, just a perfect, little mecca of all things authentically Middle Eastern, from Labneh to imported Pareve chocolate spread.  Location: A funky fresh exterior covered in graphic art, like World Peace signs, baklava, camels and snakes... and generally sparse parking.  Food: A surprisingly diverse and wonderful selection of food to please the meatless palate. We ordered the vegetarian sampler, which is a solid one-person sized lunch consisting of a pita, four falafel, a spinach pie, four little dolmas, baba ganoush, hummus, tabbouleh, and tzatziki. The falafelim were better than the ones I had in Jerusalem. So blasphemous... yet so crispy.  Other: They have sheep's milk cheese. That is a big deal. Also, their iced tea and lemonade are both delicious, meaning the potential for the perfect Arnold Palmer is right at your fingertips.  In a word: Unique. This is the most accommodating, authentic, friendly, and, dare I say, seemingly neutral Middle Eastern restaurant and market I have yet to encounter. If you're not convinced of MEBAD's worthiness by now... dir balak. Now go eat! B'tayavon!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I overlooked this place for so long--I thought I was doomed to make the trek down to Tempe whenever I wanted good authentic Middle Eastern food.  So far I've had their falafel pita, shawerma plate and lamb shish kabob plate.  All have been great. While I slightly prefer the food at Haji Baba's and Efe's/Med Fresh Grill, MEB&D is delicious enough that I can avoid the trip to Tempe. And I noticed some pictures adorning the walls in MEB&D of a wedding they had catered--I've now given up committed bachelorhood for the possibility of a wedding catered with such an awesome Middle Eastern food spread.  My only complaints are technical.   The hours are short: MEB&D closes at 8pm and on all day on Sundays. And the parking lot looks like it could get tight during a busy lunch rush, which I've avoided so far."}
{"text":"The food in this market and cafe are great but what is exceptional is that the owners show an unparalleled hospitality and kindness that shows how centered they are around connected relationships with the community. They evoke joy. Also, if you like pickles, a must-try is the pink pickles turnips dyed in vinegar and beet juice. Wow."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! I picked up lunch to go and asked for a recommendation on the fastest meal, which was the Lebanese chicken plate. The chicken was very flavorful, you could taste the fresh lemon. The meal came with a large side of rice and salad. Honestly, it was enough food for two. Will definitely be back. It's one of the healthiest options for lunch if you work nearby and are pressed for time."}
{"text":"Tiny little place with a mini middle eastern market inside, park in the large lot in the back if the 4 spaces in the front are taken. Started with the hummus really good with soft pita bread, the gyro sandwich meat was chewy, on the soft pita with tomatoes and a lot of onions.  A winner is the rosewater lemonade subtle but great tasting."}
{"text":"Lunch is busy!! But we took it to go! DELICIOUS. Had the combo, Turkish coffee and their infamous lemonade!  Yes, all the reviews are correct...it's a delicious food with great service, smiles and nice things at the register to buy...spices, cookies ect... just go, you won't regret it I promise!"}
{"text":"Yup, this place is very good.   Friendly service... check! Fair prices... check! AMAZING food... check! Best Lemonade I've ever had... check!  They are also very knowledgeable about their food ingredients, so if you have food allergies or prefer not to indulge in certain ingredients, you will have no problem dining here.  I personally recommend the Lamb, it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great shop with cafe and bakery attached. Reminded me of the small shops in the Middle East. Lots of interesting items and stock frequently changes. Tandoori Chicken Salad and some pita makes for a great picnic lunch. Shawarma is great and so are the salads. Browse through the store and find items like chocolate covered candied orange peel, saffron rock candy, or Tapuzina Orange drink (my favorite when I lived in Israel). Friendly staff."}
{"text":"After failing to get to a different restaurant in this neighborhood before they close, Monica O and I found ourselves at Middle Eastern, and I'm glad we did! This little grocery/restaurant is very cute with friendly staff and delicious food. I had trouble making up my mind (what's new?) and the lady behind the counter helped me.. I had the falafel pita.... it had fresh crisp lettuce, slice onion, tomato, and teeny tiny delicious falafel inside... oh and some kind of magic sauce. Wonderful! I also got to try the hummus, which was extremely tasty. Now, you may wonder how I got out of there without ordering a dessert as they all looked insanely tasty... I didn't see them until after I paid (ha!). Anyway, I will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"What can I say, the food is just delicious. The lemonade is something I actually have cravings for. It's nice to see so many people in this mom and pop restaurant. We will be returning on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This place has very authentic middle eastern food that will leave you satisfied and is probably my favorite in all of Phoenix. Expect great flavors, fresh ingredients, good service and a place to buy in bulk many of the components of the meal you order there.  I recommend the combo plate for you first time- you get to try a little bit of everything- the hummus, tabouleh, babaganouj, falafel, dolmas, kibbeh, gyro, tszatsiki and bread. The tabouleh is super fresh and flavorful and the babaganouj is some of the best I have had."}
{"text":"Schawarmamamamamaaaaa?  I love schawarmas in general! This is what I expect in Schawarma - for the meat to be delicious, thinly sliced full of flavors!   So what did I think of the meat at this place? First of all.. why isn't it thinly sliced? But it was very tasty and full of flavors!   I like the schawarma to be wrapped properly in its pita in foil. The pita is on the side and you stuff it yourself. There's a lot of meat - the way it should be! The tahini sauce is good.  I like the tabbouleh - refreshing. Whenever you add olive oil with vegetables and toss it together with small diced vegetables, how can you go wrong? You can't! I toss some of it in my schawarma because whenever I eat schawarmas....I like it when it has thinly sliced meat with tahini, tomatoes, lettuce and grilled onions - maybe I am asking for too much or I don't know what an authentic schawarma is (this is what I get back at Undergrad - if you went to Davis, Sam's is SOO GOOD!)!  Guy at the counter is super nice. They gave us the wrong dishes at first, we stared at it for awhile...then he realized it, he apologized and just took it and brought it to the other table - made us laugh :) because...  1) He just assumed we didn't touch the food 2) He could have given us free food for doing that 3) He could've left the pita and gave us the couple a new pita 4) The couple who received our food did NOT notice it was sitting at our table for 5 minutes  I might go back again if other people insist but I probably won't insist. I had my taste of it.   FYI - I walked in and I was surprised to see a market - that's all."}
{"text":"The baklava is made in house, and they have gluten free tabouleh and pitas.  Not too shabby!  The Greek salad is small for the price, but so tasty, it's worth the money.  Don't worry-just order it.  it misses 4 stars for a few reasons.  Some of the packaged goods seem aged. It's really hot in there. The gyro meat is weird. They microwaved my meat pie...."}
{"text":"The only thing that saved this from two stars was the baba ganoush and Gabi!  We shared a plate of the baba and hummus.  Covered with veggies and olive oil.  This was better than my actual lunch, which was a small Greek salad.   Uh...Greek????  It was romaine lettuce, a few chopped red peppers and purple onion slices with...Italian dressing.  Read: tasted just like WishBone.  Seriously.  I was disappointed, because I've read the reviews.  Maybe I just need to try other stuff.  It had a store inside, too, but I didn't have much time to check the shelves. Oh, and they pushed the lemonade BIG TIME!  Neither one of us wanted  it, but they did give us a free cup of it.  It was pretty good! I'll go again."}
{"text":"This place always makes us feel at home. They are a credit to the community and if you are a fan of Middle Eastern food, you owe it to yourself to pay them a visit. They have the best shawarma in town, bar none! My girlfriend chose this place above all other restaurants in Phoenix to celebrate her birthday. We mentioned this in passing to the waitstaff, not for any reason or expectation. We were shocked to have several of the cooks, servers and even the owner come over and sing her a Happy Birthday. In fact, the owner was smiling ear to ear to hear the reason we were there! They even brought out celebratory Turkish coffee and baklava for us to enjoy after our meal! Been going there for years and that touch of kindness will keep us going back for many more! That, and the lemonade - it is addicting!"}
{"text":"The best food in Arizona! If you want to eat like Anthony Bourdain, god rest his soul, eat here. It's authentic food, spiced well and plain delicious! On top of that - the owners are the sweetest!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best falafels ever.  Perfectly crunchy on the outside and so flavorful.  I love their lamb kabobs too.  Their simple rice and salad are so tasty.  I also like their eggplant sandwich...and it is even better when you put falafels in the sandwich.  Mmmmmmm!  Lemonade is ok, a tad too sweet for me.  A perfect place for a satisfying lunch!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this place in about 9-12 months.  The food is always outstanding, so no issues there.  Today I got the Lamb Shiskabob plate, but substiuted chicken for beef.  It comes with either Greek Salad or Tabouli, and I always order the Tabouli.  As always, the food is delish!  The rice has a nice buttery taste to it, and the meat is well-seasoned and tasty (although a little on the dry side -- just a little).  The lemonade, which is made using orange flower water, is so refreshing and delicous -- this is a must if you come here!  So why am I only giving 3 stars?  I am disappointed because they have raised their prices, but are giving less food.  For people who are new to this place, it's not a big deal because they don't know any different.  But not knowing they changed their menu, I placed my order over the phone using an old menu.  The old menu says that my entree is served with tomatoes and onions, in addition to the rice and Tabouli, so I was quite disappointed to not see any tomatoes or onions in my dish when I opened it (they are also not listed on the new menu).  It also looks like they are skimping on the meat.    On the old menu, these were the prices of the items I ordered: entree - $8.99; hummus - $2.99; and lemonade - $1.29.  These are the prices on the new menu: entree - $9.89; hummus - $3.99; and lemonade - $1.99.    I know, I know, if an extra $2.60 is going to send me into bankruptcy, then I shouldn't be eating out anyway.  However, it's more of the principal of the matter.  I don't mind paying a little more money if I'm getting a little more food.  But to raise prices and then give us less food?  That's just a food sin!  This sin won't prevent me from coming back again, but I just had to express my sincere displeasure with this. :)  BTW, I agree with other reviewers that the owners are extremely nice people!"}
{"text":"They have GLUTEN FREE PITAS!!!!!!!!!!!! And they're fuggin cheap! Like $3.50 a package or something ridiculous like that. You can sub your pita with your meal for a GF pita at no cost.  I'm eating one as I type this, no joke. I'm now a starch addict again thanks to Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli. I don't know if that's a good thing or not ;)   Seriously, I can't say enough good things about this place. Their rice is to-die-for. The lamb and kafta kabobs are the best. I've found the chicken kabobs can be a little dry at times so I generally go for the darker meats. The salads are the best I've ever had, their dressing is amazing. Oh, and their lemonade is the best. It's made with rose water and honey, you HAVE to try it! I'm not a huge lemonade drinker so I usually get an Arnold Palmer to cut the sweetness, or as the owner likes to call it, an \"Arnold Schwarzenegger.\" Seriously, get the lemonade or an Arnold Schwarzenegger, you won't be disappointed.   Every Friday I work in downtown Phoenix and come here to pick up a multiple packs of gluten-free pitas and get a fab lunch. I always think I'll try someplace else close to downtown but I just can't pass this place up.   The owner is super knowledgeable about his food and extremely sweet. Everyone that works there is very, very friendly and knowledgeable. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Lived here for 6 months and just recently discovered this place.. a true gem. Hands down best deli/bakery in town! Agree with the other comments about the owner's generosity with the amazing lemonade. Have already gone twice in 3 days!!! Please do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"So delicious and authentic. My moms first time trying Mediterranean food, so we had the combo platter. All was excellent, but chicken was our favorite of the meats. Their Greek salad is excellent! Pickled onions put it over the top. If I'm ever back in the area, I'd like to try their Lebanese chicken next time."}
{"text":"I love, love this place! We had the great fortune of meeting Isam, the owner, and Tina. Isam introduced us to their lemonade made with rose water and honey. It was outstanding -- a unique wonderful flavor you can't forget. Their food is even better -- freshly made everything. Their falafel is excellent; the tahini sauce, thick and tasty (not like the watery stuff at other place); and their meet dishes grilled to perfection. To top it off, we enjoyed the freshest baklava I've had in a decade with a perfect cup of Turkish coffee (with a touch of cardamon). Authentic, fresh, unbeatable Middle Eastern food! Thank you, Isam!"}
{"text":"UPDATE!!!!  I found a nice 5star middle eastern that has just been open 2 months; Habbouz Tunisian at 27th ave & Northern. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. I have eaten here for over 20 years. The chicken gyro is my favorite. Today I went there with my daughter. We met our good friend for lunch. The Bakery has delicious Pita bread for sale too. They have both regular Pita bread and gluten free Pita bread too. The baklava is perfectly flaky and sweet."}
{"text":"Shwarma!!!!!! SOOOOOOO GOOOOOODDDDDD!!!!! Love this place. The owner is a great guy who is easy to talk to and full of interesting stores about living in Chicago and moving to Phoenix. The food is worth more than you pay and the LEMONADE IS AMAZING!!! he uses rose water or something. I'm drooling thinking about it now.  As a bonus, the market has great middle eastern and Mediterranean stuff to pickup. Their Feta is GREAT!! puts safeway crap to same. Great place to pick up a quick lunch or filling dinner."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely a treat if you love Mediterranean cooking as authentic as a mom-and-pop store/restaurant the service was outstanding ,they had all kinds a middle eastern treats that were delicious I picked up a bag of roasted pistachios sprinkled with lime. The food was amazing from the  chicken  to the lamb it was fantastic"}
{"text":"This place is amazingly fresh and delicious. Everything was seasoned very nicely. Service was friendly and helpful! Avoid the lunch rush! It got really busy! Would definitely come back again. Lemonade was bomb. Support your local businesses!!!"}
{"text":"Love the vegetarian sampler, which I usually get with wheat pitas. Delicious falafel. And I think their baklava nests are also quite nice. You can taste just a hint of flower in there which is lovely.  They use the same flower essence in the lemonade, which I have to say *is* pretty good, especially since I don't really like lemonade. Its way too sweet though. Once I took it home and watered it down which made it much more refreshing. Otherwise I feel like I need some water to wash down the lemonade."}
{"text":"I had the hummus with beef and it was really tasty. I wish the pitas served with it were warm, though. I also had the gyro plate with salad. The gyro was decent, not the best I've ever had but it was good none the less the salad was fresh and the dressing and tzatziki sauce was SOOOOO GOOD! I also really enjoyed a pink/red pickled vegetable that was in the salad. Whatever it was, they were delicious. The owners were super friendly. I am looking forward to trying their desserts- they had sold out when I was there."}
