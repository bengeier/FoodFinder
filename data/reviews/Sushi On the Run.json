{"text":"The sushi is at a great location and the cheapest I've seen in the area .. Particularly the tofu on rice.   They also have those little containers to put your soy sauce in . Also the sashimi comes with a choice of drinks.. Needless to say I'm here quite often."}
{"text":"Good sushi for pick up to go. Great deals at times for buy one-get-one free."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place 4 stars with a caveat of only having had the BOGO offer. This place is a little cubby hole of a shop near the subway at college Park. A little hard to find. The jumbo roll is very filling and tasty. Possibly not the best sushi but 9$ for 16 pieces of fresh sushi is good value in my book. Pleasant staff. There are a couple of seats but it's more about grab n go kinda place.   I will continue to return. The mango roll calls to me..."}
{"text":"The have great sushi when they are running a BOGO! Very affordable though if they dropped their normal prices by a dollar their quality isn't too bad for the normal price. They are my go to meal for work!"}
{"text":"Note, this rating is ONLY for the half price special 5-8pm weekdays! If you pass through Yonge/College subway at this time and want something cheap and decent, come here! $12 for two trays of sashimi/sushi ! The rolls are even cheaper.   So the quality is just alright, and freshness isn't a quality you look for in a closing special. I rather enjoy salmon and this one is pretty good. Depending on the day, once I lucked out and got really fatty delicious salmon.  I thought I'd share this new favourite take out dinner spot of mine. I doubt you can find these prices anywhere in the city, for decent sushi. Without this special, I'd likely rate this 3 stars :)"}
{"text":"OK, as someone that appreciates a good quality sushi... I'm a bit embarrassed to say I eat here. \"Sushi on the Run\" doesn't really bring a picture of authentic Japanese cuisine to one's mind.   But sometimes, if there's nothing in the fridge or if I need a little bite before I go for a late dinner, I'll stop by for their cheap, BOGO sushi that everyone is talking about in the other reviews. I figure it's better for me than a pizza slice.   You won't find amazing sushi here, but you can't beat the price. I usually get the spicy salmon rolls. $5.99 for 2 trays of 8 rolls.  There are two tiny cramped spots to eat here, but you're better off just taking it to the food court steps away."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. This place right outside the College subway entrance inside the College Park building is a bit of a secret. I like it for a quick grab and go lunch.    The sushi is fresh and made same day. You get good value for your money. The rice is seasoned well and the fish tastes fresh, the rice to fish ratio is good and I don't ever find too thick of a rice layer in my rolls.  Best part is they have buy one get one free at the end of the day (I think this starts at 4pm or right before)which is great for a quick dinner on weekdays."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of sushi in Toronto altogether, but sushi from here was decent.  COME DURING BOGO HOURS, after 4:30PM.  I got the jumbo roll (kind of like a dynamite roll) and this other box that had salmon nigiri with a salmon avocado roll during BOGO (2 for $7.99). The nigiri is a bit skinnier than usual, but can't complain.  Also got two boxes of salmon maki (salmon + avocado), 2 for $5.99. Big chunks of salmon and avocado but admittedly it tastes infinitely better with soy sauce.   They are quite generous with their avocado here. Never had browning or old avocado in my rolls, contrary to some reviews.   I guess if you can nab up the good stuff, it'll be worth the money. Wouldn't come here if it wasn't for the BOGO offer though.   The store's name tells it like it is. You go into the store, buy it, then leave. It's a very small space, located between the College subway station entrance and the entrance to College Park so that pathway is always hustling. Try not to get trampled getting to this store."}
{"text":"This is the small little sushi-to-go shop right before you enter the subway station through College Park. I find the sushi/sashimi here really fresh and the prices are very reasonable, and after 4:30pm it's 2 for 1 (they charge you for the more expensive item of the two). Today I had the Maki Nigiri combo for $7.99 (fresh salmon and cucumber maki and fresh salmon and tuna nigiri), and a seaweed salad for $3.99. They were both great and for $3.99 you get alot of seaweed! It came to about $13 and they gave me a free drink :). They have assorted pop and water as options. This place is definitely great any time, but especially when you're \"on the run\" hehe ;)"}
{"text":"Always a fan of great deals and this place is definitely a steal! The buy one get one end-of-the-day sale is ahhh-mazing! Decent quality sushi for a very affordable price (regular price goes for $6~9 per box of 8 pieces)!!   Only caveat is that the staff is a bit rude.. Since the shop is really small, they just want you to make a purchase and then they urge you to get out."}
{"text":"If you're not here for the buy one get one free (BOGO), there's no reason to come here. The sushi is just average. They have 8 piece roll trays for just $5.99 + tax. They have sashimi and sushi as well but at a higher price point. They also have some small cucumber rolls  Sometimes after work I'm hungry and don't want anything in the food court so I end up buying 2 trays of rolls. I set my expectations straight when I buy things so I'm rarely disappointed. You really should not be expecting amazing sushi from this place. It's like walking into a McDonalds looking for fine dining. This place fills my random cravings if I happen to be around."}
{"text":"This is another place I've walked by countless times but never actually bought anything. The BOGO sale caught my eye ($9.03 for 2 boxes of sushi M-F after 4:30pm). Purchased 2 boxes of jumbo roll (shrimp tempura + avocado + spicy crab), 1 box of crunch spicy salmon roll (spicy salmon + avocado), 1 box of blackbird (crunchy spicy salmon + shrimp tempura + avocado).   Some things to note:  - You can tell they don't have a ton of ingredients (avocado, tempura, crab, etc.)... and that's okay! - they have nigiri - personally don't think each piece is thin (it's a good size)  - it's a bit saucy so hold off on soy sauce - will never pay regular price ($8) a box   I was going to give this place 3 stars for being no frills and having decent sushi. But I can't burn the image of chewing on my final piece and pulling a STRAND OF HAIR OUT OF MY MOUTH.  It's short and I'm sure it belongs to the gentleman that rolls the sushi.   I think I'll try other places in the path..."}
{"text":"Got shrimp tempura roll and jumbo roll together for nine bucks. They taste really good although the shrimp in the shrimp tempura roll is so small that you can barely see it. The jumbo roll is huge and tasty! Also the employees are super welcoming"}
{"text":"Cheap sushi for BOGO deal. It's day-old sushi, it's decent-ish. nothing to rave about but still fresh..ish.   If you are in the area, looking for cheap sushi that's on the go - try it."}
{"text":"A tiny sushi place with around 3-4 seats and a small ledge as a \"table\". After 4:30pm there are buy one get one free (equal or same price specials). Honestly, 16 pieces of sushi (2 boxes) for $6.75 is a pretty good deal. There's a decent variety of spicy salmon, salmon avocado, california, etc. The quality of sushi itself isn't amazing, but it is a good deal considering the price.  It's steps away from the College Park exit at College TTC station, still inside the underground mall, so it is super convenient."}
{"text":"So disgusting.  The cucumbers in the cali roll tasted like they had been frozen and the wasabi wasn't even spicy...wtf?  Gave a piece to my dog (who literally eats everything) ...he licked it and walked away.  Honestly, if my dog wouldn't even eat it, that's a sure sign something is wrong."}
{"text":"A  small shop inside the Aura condo area down stairs. We arrived at the end of the day and they had a special -  buy one and get another free. Purchased the sashimi pack with some rolls, was much better than I anticipated. Was fresh and quite refreshing. Would definitely return but of course after hours."}
{"text":"Came in here because I was in a rush to work and saw their BOGO sign outside of College station. They had a shelf full of sushi but there were maybe only 6-7 varieties of boxes. I bought 2 boxes and it came to $9. I ate at the little ledge/table that was available and boy was this sushi was nasty! I'd prefer Mac sushi over this any day and it's about the same price. The cuts of sashimi on the sushi were thin and awkward but they tasted meh and the rolls definitely looked and tasted like they were made in a rush. I can't handle wasabi but I like ginger and the wasabi was right on top of it so I couldn't enjoy any with my sushi. I had a few bites of the sushi and as much as I was in a rush and starving I could barely get it down my throat. Honestly I kind of cringe when I think about the look and taste."}
{"text":"The shape doesn't look very well but doesn't have any impact to the taste at all. It's very delicious and tasty. Especially for the buy one get one free, good price and good quality. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"other yelpers have said it all...and they're right!!!  come for the BOGO deal   they are open until they sell out, so when im off work around 7, it's really a hit or miss if there is anything left  not amazing sushi by any means, but a great deal, (2 rolls for $ after tax) when I am too exhausted to cook dinner  The girl who works there is really friendly and helpful.  give them a shot!!"}
{"text":"Generous Portion for Sushi On the Run's Salmon Sashimi.  For a take out sushi place, you can't expect much to begin with, especially when it's not run by Japanese.  However, if you lower your expectations, this place isn't as bad as it could be.  It's not cheap though.  If you want your fill, then go for the Salmon Sashimi ($12.99), which provides a generous portion of fish.  I've tried the Green Dragon Roll ($8.50), but it wasn't worth good.  Also, they don't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Came here during their daily BOGO sale (happens after 4:30pm) and got 2 of their jumbo rolls for $8 total, which is an amazing deal. I brought it and ate it at home and it was really good! Service was good and fast as this place is located conveniently next to College station. I'd come back if I want a quick sushi pickup."}
