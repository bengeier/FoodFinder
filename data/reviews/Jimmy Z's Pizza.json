{"text":"Dear Jimmy Z, I love you.  The end.

I have been searching high and low for a pizza place like this in my (new) hometown of Vegas, and have yet to find anything comparable.  Jimmy Z's pizza is so good- the dough has just the right amount of chewiness and crispiness I love, they don't drown the pie in cheese, and each slice has just the right amount of \"I need a napkin to clean up the sauce on my fingers\"-ness to it.  Oh and did I mention it's cheap?  Well it is.

Just a heads-up, this is \"square\" pizza.  Typically a thicker crust than a regular pizza and you will see a lot of sauce peeking out from the cheese.  Are you familiar with Sam's pizza just a few miles down the road?  Then you will know what I am talking about.  The middle pieces don't come with any crust, so expect to get a little messy.

We only had plain cheese pizza, so I can't speak for the toppings.  Personally, when it comes to this kind of pizza I prefer mine topping-free.  But that's just me.

I was so excited to have this old-school-east-coast pizza on my recent trip back home that I stopped here twice.  Why is it so hard to find a place like this on the west coast?  Is it really the water?  Does the humidity help with the dough?  Do all the good pizza makers keep themselves back east?  The world may never know."}
{"text":"One of the poorest quality inexpensive pizza I paid $19.90 for. Disappointing at best, but the workers were friendly!"}
{"text":"Jimmy Z's is by far the best square cut pizza in the area. Other pizza shops have similar style pizza which are good. But the BEST is still Jimmy Z's."}
{"text":"Wow finally found a great square pizza place.  The crust is not to thick and not to thin.  Sauce is amazing and the extra cheese after it comes out of the oven is a nice touch.  Can't wait to stop back!!!"}
{"text":"Stromboli was the best I've ever eaten. Crust wasnt too done. It was stuffed full of cheese and meat. Dipping sauce was delicious and the price was just right. We will def be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza around here,when its cooked right. Osso's was my favorite in washington, then sams in cbg when sam was cookin, now jimmy'z is my go to. The only problem with it, is the consistency. One day its perfect, the next day it could be burnt. great italian hoagie too."}
{"text":"Loved the crunchy crust, but wish the sauce had a bit more flavor. Love the order by the slice, which is always convenient. Overall, it's a friendly local joint that is a must try for square pizza lovers."}
{"text":"This pizza joint made my list of another top spot . You must try .Jimmy z's crust might be the best I have ever had . Sauce and cheese not to shabby also . I happen to meet the owner a few years back . He made me some dam good slices . The second time I stopped, owner wasn't working I got scared , because you know no owner present , no good pizza . Wow was I wrong his staff knows exactly how to make it . Mr Z kudos to you, train you staff hire people better then yourself and it makes you look like a superstar . At Jimmy z's they don't rush the process . It comes perfect every time . Another one of those places you stop once you will be back . This place is just minutes off of the interstate I 79 Houston exit south of Pittsburgh . Cheep-thin-square -crispy-Tasty - one or a whole Tray stop and get some . Try to eat it wile still crispy . Vent box if transporting so steam doesn't make dough not crispy . A must if you like pizza ."}
{"text":"The crust is like a cracker. ..a little too crisp.
The sauce is flavorless and cheap it has no spices in it that can be tasted.
The pepperoni is ok and the mushrooms were slimy and gross out of a can.
The onion topping was gross.
This pizza is good if you are a yokel from the area that doesn't get out much or hasn't tried any real food outside the area."}
{"text":"This pizza here is very good! Thin enough crust for it to be crunchy, but thick enough to be slightly doughy.

While entire pizzas can be ordered, most do it by the slice. I had anchovies on two slices and sausage and olives on two more. Jimmy Z's is different because the toppings are not baked on; they are sprinkled on afterward and are only slightly heated. Very different, but very good! I think the pricing is good too - $.95 per slice. 

So why only three stars out of five? We watched the guy making our pizzas behind the counter. He blew his nose and coughed, and didn't wash his hands. He then continued making our food, still without washing his hands. BLEW HIS NOSE. To me, that is a really big deal! So disgusting!"}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorite places for pizza. However, bought pizza, brought it h
ome and it was burned. Next time I ordered, I informed them and specifically requested that the pizza not be over cooked. Again brought it home an the crust was so over cooked, it was nearly inedible. I'm done with Jimmy Z's."}
{"text":"Not really my kind of pizza but I bet a lot of people like it.  I was traveling and picked up a Pepperoni pizza for dinner.  Service was good and a neat local atmospher.  A little too much sauce and a bit to crisp crust for my liking but I'm not knocking for that.  Give it a try if you're nearby looking for pizza."}
{"text":"I've been told that when it comes to pizza there are two camps in the Washington County area: Osso's and Jimmy Z's.  Having already tried Osso's I felt compelled to give Jimmy's a try and see which one I like better. 

The service was fast and friendly and there's definitely more seating room inside at Jimmy's. But I suppose most people do take out, and Osso's has more parking.  

The pizza itself, in my opinion is a tad bit better than Osso's. They both have a very good crust that holds up well to the sauce and cheese but I think it's the sauce that put Jimmy's over the top for me.  It had a bit more zest to it.  It also doesn't hurt that Jimmy's will put three slices of pepperoni on a square where as Osso's only does one. 

I'm not bashing Osso's at all here.  They produce a good product for a great price which is evident by thier customer base. But for me, I think I fall into the Jimmy Z camp when it comes to inexpensive square pizza slices in Washington County."}
{"text":"Best square cut pizza around, nice and crisp crust...just as The original Sam's Pizza made years ago!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza with 3 toppings, extra cheese being one of the toppings.  The price was $30.  I walked into the store as my pizza was being cut inside the cookie sheet tray it was baked in.  The rectangle pizza was being cut with a steak knife. My extra cheese was then sprinkled on top of the pizza along with my pepperoni ...it was then put in 2 boxes without being put back in the oven.  The pizza was as about as bad as pizza could be.  Mind you..I had asked before I ordered the pizza how the pizza was going to be cooked.  I asked if it was going to be cooked on a slab.  It was inside a cookie sheet tray which was then on top of a slab...which is hardly the same thing.  The pizza was as close to terrible as pizza can be.  Won't be back needless to say."}
