{"text":"Zzeeks Put a flyer on door that they delivered in my area.. Called in order. Took over an hour to get here and food came cold and not good at all. Will not ever order from Zzeeks again!"}
{"text":"Drove by a few times, we decided to order last night. They had a pizza combo we love, Philly cheese steak, so that was a Plus! It was delicious!  Cooked perfectly with hearty toppings. The wings were on the small side, but crispy and great. My husband loves hot sauce and usually delivery \"hot wings\" are a joke, but their suicide sauce was actually very Hot! He enjoyed them very much. I felt it was a little pricey at first, but the food quality was excellent,  well worth the price. We are excited to order again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Zzeeks on Sunday for lunch for their wing special and it was amazing! I got the boneless and he got bone in and it was to die for! Big wings and they were fresh out of the fryer! They took our order fast and we got our food fast! I would highly reccomend this place to anyone! Plus fresh tapped beer always help it all go down smoother!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, wings are awesome and delicious. I live near by and great to see the center filling up. Will be back!"}
{"text":"They don't honor their own coupons. We had a coupon they said was printed in error. The manager wouldn't honor it. For a pizza? Customer loyalty means nothing. Been going there since they opened. Good pizza but Management sucks. Message to management, there are other Pizza restaurants."}
{"text":"Really great pizza, great customer service Efrian was extremely nice and friendly! Thanks for the great pizza and service!"}
{"text":"Good prices on pizza and it tastes good. I was happy that the order was ready when we picked it up even though they were a bit busy. I had the meatball sandwich. It was decent enough but I'll probably stick to the pizza and/or try a different sandwich on my next visit"}
{"text":"Went here Tuesday 9/6/16 at 9:58 and expected them to be open till 10:30 pm (as said on the website and also their front door), but the person who came to the door signaled the place was closed. I pointed out the sign and the time I read online and he said that that wasn't their hours. He basically said that everything was shut down and turned off. I assume he was working alone and didn't want to be there anymore."}
{"text":"We LOVE Zesty Zzeeks!! Tommy is the manager and he has such pride and care for his business and it shows. The pizza is amazing, salad fresh and the price can't be beat."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings for a party or just dinner with the family! Quality is there and fairly priced. They almost always have some type of deal that suits the need. Plus they have (super fast) FREE DELIVERY!"}
{"text":"The first couple times we went which was shortly after they opened we were not impressed. Well we decided to try one more time since they are right by our house and  they must have worked out all the kinks. The pizza and wings are so good! We tried the pizookie too and it was good but we wished the cookie was softer. Have been back three times since and each time has been awesome! All in all very happy to have this pizza place so close by. Love it!"}
{"text":"We order from Zzeeks all the time and they never disappoint. Their food is awesome and they always deliver it super fast, even on the weekends."}
{"text":"Great staff! Good pizza! We ate here for the 1st time tonight. Very helpful and friendly staff. Salad was huge. Pizza was nicely cooked, good crisp on crust. Sauce is also tasty. Will be back to try the philly cheese steak."}
{"text":"Zzeeks is an amazing pizza joint! They now serve Eeggees at the one in Chandler (with their liquor license you can add a little something to it and pretend you're still in college). Although they are a little pricey for their specialty pizzas, their quality is bar none. Their slice sizes are New York large.  I also like the extras they do - such has having cauliflower crusts available & free delivery with a certain purchase point (which is not hard to hit)."}
{"text":"I came for the wings and I was impressed! Great flavors! We were even given samples of different flavors before we ordered to help us decide. The wings were on the small side but that was ok because they tasted great and I was full from the 10 I ordered.   Side note to the owners/manager: I love, love, love ranch with my wings. Most places give you a small cup of ranch with one order, which usually is not enough. Y'all have bigger cups and give 2 with the order. I felt bad for wasting ranch because the second cup wasn't needed.  We had two orders of wings (4 sides of ranch) and an order of macaroni bites (2 sides of ranch) and 3 of those weren't used. Save some money and serve just one of those big cups per order. Thanks for the generosity tho!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place !!! Staff is incredible, food is amazing !!! Love that I can customize my pizza to my liking and not have to pay an outrageous price! Salads are also amazing and again I can get what I want!  We will be back for sure !!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  The service is just fine.  The staff is helpful and they have no problem explaining what they like about the food!  I like pizza, I am a sauce fan.  The sauce here is better than most.  There is at least attention put on it, which is half the battle.  The crust is not bad either.  I also had the Philly Cheestake.  The bread was good and the meat was plentiful.  Flavor?  I'll have to try it again.  Enjoy!  They deliver too!"}
{"text":"First Yelp review I have ever done and honestly it's because of how good the service at Zzeeks was last night. Went in with my family for wings and pizza. Everyone was friendly and very helpful. So much so that my youngest wanted cheese when everyone else wanted pepperoni. Instead of having to order two different pizzas, they were great and just said they would make her her own slice of cheese instead. Pizza, wings, and salad were all awesome. Beer was cold and had a good selection. Can't wait to come back just for the service alone. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. My go to in when in Gilbert. Among the best in the valley in my opinion."}
{"text":"We went here kind of late on a Monday night... the place was pretty empty. First of all, the service was excellent.  We ordered a pepperoni pizza, philly cheese steak sandwich and an Italian sandwich. All of it came out in less than 15 mins and was delicious.  The pizza reminds me of Barro's but with a thinner crust and less crust on the outside (my big complaint about Barro's pizza).  The sandwiches looked picture perfect... and tasted as good as they looked... The bread was nice and soft. Move over Venezias and Barro's, I have a new go to pizza place."}
{"text":"There is nothing special about this place but that doesn't make it bad either.  The pizza was OK. They use a conveyor belt oven like Dominoes and that is usually a sign for me to walk out the door.   It was late and this was the only place nearby that Yelp came up with that was still open.   If you like Dominoes or Papa Johns you will like this place far more than I do.   This is the kind of pizza where the crust is the best part because it's more like a breadstick than a pizza dough.   I can't comment on anything but the pizza."}
{"text":"Nice little place with great snacks. We got the meatball dish. You got 5 huge meatballs in a marinara sauce. It was very filling and really delicious! Next time I hope to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Another location I had not been to. I always say we moved out here for Zesty Zeek's pizza. We had tried this pizza when we were in Phoenix on vacation. We were seriously taken with the sauce. We took a gallon home with us. This visit was really good. This seemed like a quieter location than the others, but still had the same atmosphere. There was sports happening on all the TV's. It is a happy place. The pizza was great. Loaded with fresh toppings. What I like about this pizza is they are not stingy with the red peppers. We substitute red peppers for mushrooms. We order a small and still take home half for lunch during the week. If you are a fan of cold left over pizza, this is the pizza to order. Tastes great!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, but the last time was quite a while ago and I don't remember it.  Some places have pizza that can make for a good slice, and some don't.  Unfortunately, this place doesn't.  If you look at their whole pies that come fresh out of the oven they look great, but the slices just don't hold up.  The slice was thin and looked dead on arrival.  See the picture. The cheese has no elasticity and the crust is flat. Some places add some fresh mozz on top before putting the slice in the oven and this place needs it badly.  It has more of a look/feel of frozen pizza.  What surprised me was when I folded it in half and took a bite the little thin slice dropped quite a bit of oil onto my hands.  Must have been hiding under the hardened cheese.  When I was ordering I saw some old looking pizza under a heat lamp next to the register and I skeptically asked if those were the slices.  The lady said no, but it looked to be the same thing when I got my slices.  Have a look before you order to see if it's something you'd be interested in or not.  That doesn't mean this isn't a good place, it just means I'm not a fan of their slices.  If their fresh pizzas are like the pictures on here then I'll try that next.  It's easy to find, friendly workers, easy parking, free soda refills, Eegee's from Tucson, good menu, clean place."}
{"text":"Ordered slice of pizza and beer combo. Pizza was good, had black olives as my topping..  I'm not a pizza snob, but the pizza was nothing fancy.  I did like that you basically get 2 slices. Wings were good and crispy, especially for .60 cents on Sunday.  Thanks Zzeeks!  I'll be back  Update---back again for round two.  I think it was better this time.  Had the lunch combo with fountain drink and the wings.  Best deal for lunch hands down.  Food was hot and fresh and full of flavor.  Thanks again!  I love to support local!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Zzeeks for awhile. My sister, brother in law and I decided to try it tonight. Very pleased! The pizza was awesome, the wings were juicy and fat and the service was pleasant and quick. We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"one word AMAZING i will for sure be back dont let one bad employee tell you the story of this place i gave them a second chance and im truely blown away with how good this place actually is"}
{"text":"Strange smell inside the restaurant, like spoiled eggs. Sat outside to avoid the smell. The staff was very friendly, even came outside and offered to turn on the fireplace. The pizza was good and the wings were cooked to perfection. 4 out of 5 stars only because the smell."}
{"text":"I had an amazing pizza experience at Zesty Zzeeks Pizza this afternoon! Exceptional customer service! Super friendly and personable staff- Thank you!! High quality pizza! My pizza was Home Alone 2 status fresh, and the carbonation of the soda machine was spot on phenomenal. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant. It had a small dining area but large enough to not feel cramped. The staff was all very happy and helpful. I eat a gluten free diet and was really happy to see my husband and I could get a 14in pizza here for a reasonable price. We also had Buffalo wings. The sauce was just right amount of spice and has a good amount of meat on them. I will definitely be coming back again and letting everyone know about the great experience we had. Not to mention they also serve Eegee's!"}
{"text":"Good prices, good pizza: ) I honestly wish the wings were a bit crispier but I did enjoy the flavor. Maybe you have to request them extra crispy? Overall I enjoyed my first experience there: )"}
{"text":"Omg cheeseburger pizza! I've been searching for it ever since Godfathers left and another chain stopped selling their version of it a few years ago. It's so good! And the cauliflower crust is amazing. Can't wait to try the broccoli!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. We ordered two pizzas and they were great! Pizza crust is very good. Also ordered spaghetti and meatballs. Definitely will go back and try one of their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Against my better judgement we decided to give you guys another chance only to be disappointed even worse this time around. Placed my order through the YELP app, an hr goes by ETA goes by, I call the restaurant only to be informed that ETA given by the app should be ignored and add at least 45 mins more to the time because apparently their online ordering system gives random ETA. For 1 pizza pie, 1 order of wings and 1 egees, took longer than an hour and a half . Talking to Richard who kept on referring to my husband and DUDE and BRO then hung up on us in the middle of conversation. Food finally arrives GUESS WHAT , it's not correct, the pizza was crushed, FOOD IS NOT EVEN COOKED PROPERLY. The driver continued to say that she's the only one working, You are in the restaurant business with delivery options you  failed to deliver on that goods and services. For $35 i paid for undercooked, damaged pizza, nasty boneless wings with the wrong sauce and EVEN WORSE really really bad service where apparently it is my fault that I ordered online and it's just OH WELL. That is the most appetizing food i had ever received definitely worth the wait. ( sense sarcasm) So freaking pissed, Just when you think it doesn't get any worse I have to hear my husband do the I TOLD YOU SO speech. HIS WORDS STOP ORDERING FROM THESE 3rd rate pizza shop."}
{"text":"So i'm with a buddy at a local favorite spot for wings. Lines are long, unbearable slow service. He says why don't we try Zekes it's a mile down the road and their flyers on my fridge. Always wanted to try it, so I'm like sure let's go! Best decision EVER! Awesome service, freaking delicious wings and the place is very cozy. This place should be a staple as it is firing on all cylinders and food is beyond imagination. Really really good!!!"}
{"text":"What makes or breaks a pizza is mainly the sauce and crust. Zzeeks sauce is as zesty as their name implies. The thin-style crust was fluffy and crispy. Not doughy or soggy. Excellent. The choice of toppings was above average. You got to admire a joint that offers artichoke hearts and roasted bell peppers. Service was very fast and friendly. The restaurant has a nice ambience and is very clean."}
{"text":"This was the first time we have ordered from here. 16\" Pizza was $33 with tip and delivery. It was not hot, Chichen was cubed and tough, no cheese on it, very. Blande, will not order this garbage again"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Their chicken fingers are amazing. Some of the best fingers I've had. Well worth the money. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Holy shit!! The bread bites, boneless wings and the pizza were super spectacular!!   Crust on the pizza was nice a crispy on the bottom.  Wings were good size and the hot sauce had great flavor.  Bread bites! I don't know where to start, crunchy with a bunch of garlic and butter could anyone really ask for anything better."}
{"text":"As I sit here with a belly full of lemon pepper wings, I wonder if I will ever go anywhere else for wings. They were crispy, very flavorful, and so juicy inside. I couldn't have asked for anything more. Great customer service and a very clean place as well. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First off the customer service is unacceptable. A few weeks ago I had my heart set on some wings so I called and placed and an order for boneless wings. I went and picked them up, when I got back to work I found that they were bone-in wings. I called and let them know I had been given the wrong order and asked if they could deliver the wright order to my office as this was an inconvenience. He said \"I am sorry, I cannot do that however I can credit you the cost of your order toward a future purchase and get you an order of boneless wings started.\" I agreed and drove back to pick up the wings, when I asked to give him my name for the credit toward my future order he denied it. He said since I came back and got the right order he decided not to credit me for the inconvenience. I find this incredibly rude and bad for business, especially since I work for the apartment complex near by. I no longer allow them to flyer our community as I do not wish for my residents to receive the poor service that I received. Try Nicantoni's instead, GREAT FOOD and SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"Great wings. It's been awhile since I had wings this good. The pizza was pretty good too. Need to get some limes for the Mexican beers."}
{"text":"We have had delivery twice and pick up once.  All were excellent.  Tasty, well prepared and the food was hot.  Use for employee lunch and is s winner.  Now requested often."}
{"text":"Easter Day Order: Ordered the Beast 16in , Caribbean flavored  wings and the mac and cheese nuggets.   Service was was great. My family loved everything. The mac and cheese nuggets was good but not with the ranch.  We will make this spot our regular place since it's so close."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time tonight. It was very good.  I got the deluxe and added jalapeños :)  I ordered the cauliflower crust but the cashier misunderstood me. I got my pizza with regular crust. I wasn't disappointed though. It just gave me another reason to come back again.   Food was great, customer service was great. I wish they had just ONE more TV closer for table viewing. Its not a huge place, but seating has an interesting layout and theres enough for an average amount of people.  I wish this place wasn't so far away from the Ocotillo area! Needless to say, I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"This place was an unexpected gem! The crust is chewy and puffy- it's my favorite! The staff was AMAZING with the kids, engaged them and indulged them, really made a 'strip mall pizza stop' a whole experience!"}
{"text":"Recently we had a not so good experience coming into eat, the manager heard and gave a gift certificate and was very apologetic for his staff! We love the food heat and also love the no delivery fee! We have become regulars in the short amount of time since this location has opened and we love it!"}
{"text":"We work right across the street so we decided to come get a pizza before our Saturday shift. We like to support local businesses!  Unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations, maybe I didn't get the right pizza but it was really bland. I got the Philly Steak Pizza  it did not taste like anything. The dough was good though.  Maybe we will try again, but it will not be our #1 choice for pizza. Too bad, it was quite convenient for us."}
{"text":"Kind of a let down. I was expecting more. I thought the pizza was average. And the price was above average. The staff was friendly and they seemed to take pride in what they did. All in all it's just a matter of my personal preference. Because they did a good job it just wasn't my kind of pie."}
{"text":"My husband has been craving pizza like crazy ever since we have started this Keto diet and sometimes making our own pizza crust is not always convenient. I found this place and he got a chance to try it... and he is talking great things about it! He got a cauliflower pizza crust with pepperoni, chicken, and sausage on top. Sadly he wouldn't share with me but we will definitely be back and this time I'll get my own."}
{"text":"Went here on 10/8/16, Pizza was great, wings tasted awesome. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"By far best pizza and sides I have had in Chandler. I ordered the white chicken pizza and mozzarella sticks.  The mozzarella sticks were ever so crispy and buttery. By far the best  Pizza was perfectly done, crisp crust and fresh ingredients. Loved it all and this was a delivery."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and my stepson. The chicken wings were excellent. I ordered the calzone and it was very good as well. Close location to my place and will be back. Sometimes you can find a Groupon for it. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I just had the BEST time here!! Great atmosphere and awesome employees!! The food was AMAZING. From the fried zucchini to the pizza... plus the dessert bites... we were in heaven!! Efran was very attentive to our needs and has the best personality!! Honestly cannot wait to go back!! If I could give this place more stars I would!!! Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"Nicely decorated restaurant. A hello when we came in or how can I help would have been nice. Went for chicken wings. Lots of choices was nice. We got the lemon pepper and hot mustard. The wings were the best part of the experience. Small but tasty.   We asked does it include carrots and celery they said yes.  two carrot sticks and celery for double ordered wings seems sad. And that they were obviously days old. No better.   They are my neighbors so I will try again. Maybe when they are busier the veggies won't be days old."}
{"text":"Good pizza but service needs some help.  We also ordered wings.  Some seemed like they could have been cooked longer, but pretty good flavor.  Pizza was actually really good, I'll be back for pizza."}
{"text":"Had to say the Boneless Wings \"Honey BBQ\" & Fried Mac & Cheese was the BOMB .... The delivery guy was SUPER COOL sorry I forgot his name. Keep up the great work guys and I will be a returning customer...."}
{"text":"Great first time experience! Placed the order online and everything was exactly as requested. Their online ordering system allows precise customization of toppings, doneness, number of slices, etc.  Ordered the cauliflower crust pizza and a small side salad. Everything was delicious! Pizza toppings were abundant, salad ingredients were nice and fresh, and the cauliflower crust was excellent.  Delivery driver arrived promptly, was very friendly and polite.  Best food delivery experience I have had in years."}
{"text":"Efrim the manager was awesome! Family loved the food and service. We stopped by on my birthday with the family. The pizza reminded us of our old home in California."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza joint! Bud Light and Coors Light are on draft and the rest is all craft. 6 other craft taps to choose from! Wings and calzones are awesome here as well! Definitely gonna be a regular here!"}
{"text":"OMG  Such a terrible experience just right now, we came in because we were looking for cauliflower crust pizza, and the website says they are offering that now! Great right... no  The menu says that they can do the same pizza on a gluten free crust for some additional charge, so we picked what we wanted to order, we came in to the counter and this guy, with bleached long hair came in to get our order and clearly already showing signs of impatience looking to my 4 year old son going around the restaurant while I asked about the cauliflower crust.  When I asked to have my pizza on the large size and the cauliflower crust, he literally say \"NO... we don't do that\"   I asked what did he meant by that, and he proceeded to tell me about that the cauliflower crust is NOT THEIRS, that they buy from somewhere else frozen and it's only offered in a 10\" size.  I asked them what kind of pizza they offered in the frozen cauliflower crust, because at this point I was afraid they were pre-made pizzas, and he looked at me like I am a moron with a \"duh\" face smirking in the corner of his face and pointed to menu, with a attitude like I was bothering him with ALL my questions and he was too cool to even answer, so he just pointed to the menu!  The same menu that says they offer gluten free options in other sizes and the same menu that does not mention anything about the cauliflower crust being only offered in a frozen 10 inch pre made size made by who knows who.  When I turned to my wife to ask what she wanted to order, due to the clear change of plans cause by this confusion, he turned around and said to let him know when we made up our minds...  Well  Since we moved here 6 months ago, just 3min away from the restaurant, we wanted to try this place, no need to say we will not come back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time, we ordered our pizza ahead of time for pickup, online. Waited 20 minutes, then went to pick it up. Nobody was paying attention to the online orders, so when we got there, they hadn't even started cooking anything yet. Mistakes happen, and they were apologetic, so I let it slide. We got home, and tried our pizza. It was good enough, that I was willing to give them another shot.  I just went back yesterday. I wanted to buy an eegees Fun Pack, and I'm always ready to eat pizza. We decided to go in to order this time. Holy cow, what an awful experience. I started with the eegees. Note, the big styrofoam container it comes in, clearly states it serves 25. I'm from Tucson, and have bought it dozens of times. I've bought it one other time at another pizza place here in Mesa. The standard is that it includes 25 styrofoam cups, 25 spoons, and a big plastic ladle to serve it with. I ask for the ladle.  \"We don't sell the ladle.\"  Ok, no problem. I've probably got some at home. I ask for the cups. The guy behind the counter practically threw them at me. I counted them after I left, and there were only 22 by the way. I ask for spoons, and this is what really gets me frustrated. \"We don't sell the spoons. I need those spoons for my other customers.\" Are you kidding me? I'm more persistent for some spoons. He reluctantly grabs a handful, tapes them together, then hands them to me. 14 spoons. By this point, I've been made to feel like the worst customer in the world, for asking for the serving utensils that an eegees Fun Pack comes with everywhere else. I pay for it, and leave. Didn't even bother ordering dinner, since I was treated so poorly. I understand everybody has bad days, and this guy was obviously already agitated about something. He didn't have to rain all over my parade though.  If anybody else is brave (or dumb) enough to order large amounts of eegees there, do yourself a favor and just buy the cups, spoons, and ladle at the dollar store like I eventually did. It will save you from a major headache."}
{"text":"Hubby wanted to try a new pizza place and this has eegees available. We ordered online and was given an estimated time of 25 min. We received our food within 20min and it was nice and hot. The delivery guy was friendly and he didn't forget anything. We will defiantly try this place again. Food was delicious and very much to our liking."}
{"text":"First time coming here, small but nice dining area. Got a pizza and house salad. Pizza was ok, salad was huge and a great value. I'll be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place until I Yelped \"deliveries\" for pizza and so happy I found them! Best crust, best pizza, and best options! They have amazing desserts we ordered a large chicken pesto pizza with the Zeppoles for dessert. It didn't come with the vanilla dip which I thought it came with which bummed us out. They have so many other options to pick from for delivery which is exactly the type of place we were looking for. Can't wait to try other pizzas and the pizookie!"}
{"text":"Living Chandler group promoting this place, so Tried it out...   Ordered Wings and Hawaiian pizza..  The wings weren't Crunchy which I Like, but the sauce was very good, almost like a honey sweetness with the buffalo, really good mix, tho I do prefer fried crunchier wings, but will have these again..   Hawaiian, pizza was pretty delicious as well, the dough was good, but the sauce, has a different little flip to it all that makes it stand out a bit in a good way!  Staff are VERY Friendly, and mellow, Dining area very clean, KUDOS !!  All in all, this place is good food, decent prices,,, and..... They Serve Eegees... will try next time,,"}
{"text":"Well. We decided to come back and give them a second try after a poor first time experience in hopes to increase my rating. Sadly, this just isn't our go to place. $35 for dinner and we left food. We NEVER leave food. And husband NEVER leaves pizza behind so it's a big thing.  We ordered moz cheese sticks, extra crispy Mango Hab wings, and a small meats pizza with extra cheese.  Moz sticks came out first. I think they're beer battered? Didn't care for them. Didn't get my ranch I ordered with them.   Next came our pizza. It was odd because the toppings were hot. But the pizza itself was not? I had expectations for some ooey gooey cheesy pizza and it didn't seem like much cheese for extra cheese. Pizza was actually better last time we went. Compared to this time.  Finally our wings came out. They were dark in color so I was excited because they were definitely extra crispy. But no. Just like last time, they were soft and barely had a crisp to them. Maybe the oil was too hot? Maybe they sat around. I don't know. But again. Disappointing.  Same young girl was working behind the counter. And she was still getting barked orders from behind the wall. They had poker blaring on the tv near the \"bar area\" made it hard to hear much else.  Place seems popular for to go orders. But it just wasn't the place for us. Sad to say. One great thing though! They are next door to the BEST ice cream place ever."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The crust was cooked just perfectly!! Nice amount of sauce and fresh toppings. The bread bites were so ridiculously good!! I had their boneless hot wings and those were out of this world! Even their ranch was delicious!!! Two thumbs up from this gal!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and breadsticks. Ordered online and had to wait once in the restaurant, that was the only drawback. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"Hi my name is Dominic today was the first time I was going to try your pizza I walked in the place and placed a order for one slice and a drink I then waited 16 minutes and I was so upset I asked for my refund and I will never go back worst experience ever oh the cherry on top they didn't have the common courtesy to even say sorry bunch a teenagers who don't care about work just poor customer service   4/2/18 I was contacted by the owner of this company who was compassionate and respectful to this situation I will be changing my 1 star to 5star based of his customer service that's what I expect this whole situation was over customer service thanks again for reaching out  4/8/18 just ordered a pepperoni pizza and jalapeño poppers everything was awesome, thanks again for reaching out and providing great service I will be definitely coming back soon, Thanks again!!"}
{"text":"Love their wings!  Lots of sauce, real honey on their honey BBQ and pretty big.  Love that I can get an Eegee's without having to go down south to Tucson. Pizza isn't too bad either since it has lots of sauce!  It's a chill environment with $2.50 bottled beer every day and $.60 wings on Sundays (that was a nice surprise to see!). Try it out and see for yourself"}
{"text":"I wanted to redo my last review on this pizza joint. First and foremost I have NEVER had a owner or manager reach out for being unsatisfied as the way Jody did. I was unhappy and was taken care of. I got a free pizza to make up for the super greasy one last time and must I say.... so glad I used it!!! Got a pepperoni & sausage pizza and it was so good. The pepperoni was crispy just the way I love it and the crust wasn't covered in grease. Which is a good thing because my family is one to love eating pizza crust. So I have gave them 5 stars and they will continue to be my spot when I want a yummy pizza. Thank you Zzeeks and thank you Jody!!"}
