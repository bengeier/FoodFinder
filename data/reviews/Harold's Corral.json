{"text":"Food is ok.  Alcohol is way more expensive than The Chip.   The quality has crashed.  They put on a good show though - a few weeks ago we got to see one doorman toss his coworker across the bar.  They were fighting over who got to toss some guy out.  What a bunch of clowns!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great relaxed atmosphere.  My husband and I like it so much, we had our wedding reception there!  It is our go-to place and never disappoints."}
{"text":"I'm just going to start off saying I'm not a fan, I am not the sort of person that would like the place. It's dirty, crowded, loud, and the food is gross, unless you get the ribs...apparently, but I wouldn't know about that because I'm not a fan of ribs...sorry guys. I had a cheeseburger. It took an HOUR for our food to come and when it did it was cold, soggy, and absolutely disgusting, I took one bite and couldn't finish it. It was horrid and I noticed most of the people around me didn't eat their food either, except for the drunk ones of course because drunk people eat everything. The waiter was a bit rude, we actually had to go and get him on several occasions because he didn't come by to check on us. For those of you who like that kind of back country environment, good for you. It's not for me and I would not recommend other people to it. Especially if they like food."}
{"text":"Waiter was rude, not only my opinion but another couple walked out. I ordered Cajun ribeye sandwich which had so much salt I couldn't eat and the fries were cold. Waste of money, never again."}
{"text":"Incredibly poor service, sat at out table for 45min before getting our order taken and we watched an entire football game without the waitress ever asking if we wanted drinks, Literally an entire football game.  Not surprisingly, the staff had a tired energy level and didn't seem like they gave a damn, Just working for a paycheck. Pretty mind blowing a place like this survives during this day and age.  Food was edible but had a quality that reminded me of my freshman year of college in the dorm cafeteria."}
{"text":"I've lived in cave creek, and my fiancés family lives in cave creek. It's a great town! I love all the bars. Except for this one. Harold's has been God awful since the very first day I went there. The service is terrible. I've waited at a table for service for 2 hours before. Obviously I just ordered from the bar! I did ask if there were servers that would come over and take care of us, the guy told me yes... He'd send someone over.... I waited and waited. (I was and still am in the serving industry.) and let me add... I'd understand if they're busy!!! But when you're the 3rd table in the whole place, and 6 employees walk by your table and don't even acknowledge you... It's ridiculous. I give this place another chance every 6 months. Because I do love the atmosphere and my fiancé loves the off track horse betting. And of course I do like ONE bartender. I can't remember her name, but she's always on point and she has a great personality and is very attentive, even if she's busy. (She's short with brown hair)   We decided we'd stop in today to grab a drink. (She was working) noticed us right away. But what was disturbing is that every single table was filthy!!!! We watched 6 or 7 employees walk past these tables.... I was floored. There were flies all over the old food, and drinks! One of the tables which obviously a server was rolling their silverware! Flies, plates and plates of old food!!! You couldn't even sit at a table without sliding some disgusting old plates over, gagging. I was just so turned off by this I had to leave. We couldn't even enjoy our drinks. It was absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday brunch. Blood Mary's very good."}
{"text":"My dad lives in Cave Creek and we always stop here for a couple meals.  I haven't had any bad food and have enjoyed my experience.  It does get busy, which isn't a surprise - its a fun place.  This definitely isn't a fancy place but if you want some good simple food, this is a great place.  Too bad it is a Steelers bar though.  They're the worst fans after Packer fans."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, it's my dad's favorite. He likes to imagine he is a gruff cowboy who rides his horse up to Harold's to enjoy the huevos rancheros and giant stacks of french toast.  It's fun to be pretending by breakfast time!  I know that Harold's is lively at night but the breakfast is pretty awesome, too! The food is pretty good and you get huge quantities of it! On prior visits I have worked my way through the breakfast enchilada, the southwestern eggs benedict, and a large stack of pancakes. All food comes out hot and with a smile!   Definitely a fun place to take visitors (or yourself) and reminisce about the old southwest."}
{"text":"If you get a server named mike move sections as soon as possible he's rude, and treated my mom and sister terribly. Horrible server who should not be in the industry."}
{"text":"Food here was really good! One tasty burger I had. We had a great time and all but service needs some help. Make the stop sit at the bar and avoid the table service."}
{"text":"Big email promotion about MSNBC being there election night but they didn't bother to email again when it was cancelled - cute trick.  The beef ribs were the worst ever.  Three huge bones with next to no meat at all and what there was could not have been tougher. Based upon our experience, GROSSLY over-rated."}
{"text":"My wife and I went in for a late lunch. She had a spinach salad and I had a Cobb salad. Not something most people would order on this type of place. Both were fresh, cold, sizable and very good tasting. Our waitress was excellent. We look forward to going back very soon."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this was the best breakfast I've ever hAd! Happy Labor Day to me! Great place to sit outside and beautiful views! Love the cheese steak and the wagon wheel breakfast! Can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast after a night of celebrating and it was the right place to be!  Started with a bloody mary and dug in on a breakfast burrito.  No complaints at all.   Total biker bar - helps if you are a Steeler's fan too.  Staff is friendly, the regulars claim their spots early.  Can't wait to get back there!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Food has gone downhill majorly. Fun for drinking. Bad for food"}
{"text":"I have lived in Cave Creek for 20 yrs & Harolds USE TO BE the place to go in Cave Creek.  They have suffered w/the surrounding bar food competition...none of which is better than a 3 star.  HOWEVER, Harold's has never had anything notable on their menu or worthy of a second visit.  Eat before you go if you like the atmosphere...the kitchen is filthy thus mediocre food& rude staff!!"}
{"text":"I live in Southern California.  My wife and I are in Scottsdale for the Thanksgiving holiday and our friends suggested that we go to this restaurant.  We went Wednesday night before Thanksgiving.  We all had the Wednesday night Prime Rib special.  I have absolutely no complaints about the food whatsoever, and I would have given this a 5 star review.    But, unfortunately, the customer service part of our experience fell short.  So, not being from Arizona, I was unaware of Proposition 206 that was passed in November, 2016.  I became aware of the proposition when our bill arrived and on the bill was a line item titled \"AZ Proposition 206....\" and an amount with no explanation as to the calculation.  I asked our waiter and he told me that it had something to do with the Proposition and minimum wage and paid sick leave.  I asked the waiter if this was disclosed on the menu or on a sign when we walked into the restaurant.  He referred me to the general manager and told me that he would come to our table for an explanation.  The general manager came to our table armed with a menu, and on the back of the menu in 2 point type at the bottome was the following statement:  \"menu prices do not include sales tax or proposition 2016 surcharge.\"    I told the general manager that this was unacceptable.  I told him that the restaurant is entitled to do/charge whatever they want, but my expectations are that this would have been disclosed prior to our sitting down to order.  This is not like a sales tax which is an expected additional charge.  As a matter of fact, I have come to learn that not all restaurants have adapted this policy.  Heck, the menu does not even tell how the charge is calculated, and it is only after I asked the general manager that I found out that the surplus is calculated by taking the food charge and multiplying it by 4%.    I told him that this was not adequate disclosure and that there should be a sign when customers walk in disclosing this surcharge.    Also, think about this.....a lot of people tip by taking the total bill, including sales tax, and multiplying that total by the tip % that they choose.  Since a lot of this restaurant's customers are tourists, my guess is that not only are they not aware of the surcharge. but they also don't realize that they are tipping on the surcharge amount as well.  All I ask is for full disclosure.  The restaurant can do/charge whatever they want.  If the general manager or anyone else at the restaurant is reading this review, I want to let them know that they have lost a customer for life.  And, anyone who is reading this email.....you are now made aware of this restaurant's policy and you can make your own decision on whether to eat at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Harold's is just a great place to eat, drink, and be entertained, period.  It's fun, it's noisy and raucous, and the live music is simply fantastic!  If you want it a bit more quiet, sit in the back in the lovely, yet still rustic, fire place room.  The food is what it is; either good cowboy/pub grub, or more expensive meals.  I've been to Harold's countless times since moving to the Cave Creek/Carefree area and have never had a bad meal or a disappointing experience.  Long live Harold's!"}
{"text":"What a terrible place.  No one there, but waited more than 20 minutes for service that never came.  The waiter said he was busy and would get to me when he could.  Well, that will never happen because I will never go back."}
{"text":"looking for some western fun without the touristy crap? Harolds is your place! Really fun atmosphere, live music, great drinks and the little blond manager is super sweet! She was very accommodating with our table request as our party got bigger and didn't complain that our kids were a little rambunctious( yes we brought our children, it wasn't late). Anyway, been there a few times and will always make a point to go there when we are in the Cave Creek area.  5 stars for the peeps are Harolds!"}
{"text":"Always fun, always good food! If you haven't been to Harold's you have got to drive out to Cave Creek and eat here! It is unique, the food is awesome and the prices are excellent. They have kept the charm of the 1930's alive and well and it is like a step back in time when you enter. The place is old, but spotless. The service is fast, friendly and they get your order right. You will enjoy your stop, regardless what some other reviewers have to say."}
{"text":"Great taco salad and BBQ sandwich. Never disappointed. Very cowboy feel to the place."}
{"text":"Harold's lost some longtime regulars last night. For years we have gone to happy hour here every weekend. Over Thanksgiving weekend the owner decided to not offer happy hour prices without notice. Last night the same occurred after we had made reservations for a large party and even double checked happy hour time for the night. After employees having to run back and forth with our questions, and the owner refusing to come out and speak with us, they gave us one round of drinks on the house. Saturday happy hours are on their website and the owner  refused to honor them, saying it was a holiday weekend since the Steelers were playing the next day. So over Harold's, seeking new happy hour!"}
{"text":"What a fun place!  Where else can you get a meal, a cold beer, listen to good live music, dance, and have a mixture of cowboys and cowgirls, bikers, snowbirds, and tourists!  What a trip.  Place is hopping on the weekends.  Food is not the reason to make the trip, but it is acceptable, and the fried chicken is really good here.  Good old western time in fun Cave Creek."}
{"text":"We visit Harold's every time we are in town , food And service is always good . Tonight we had the BEST. Waitress  , Lynn .  Great addition to the staff .   Rich & terry"}
{"text":"What a great place! Service was excellent food was even better. If you're in Cave Creek you have to stop here."}
{"text":"Usually go for the great breakfasts or the fried chicken dinner.  Always get the French Onion soup which is the best in the valley!  I went there on Christmas Eve for dinner and instead of fried chicken I ordered the baby back ribs for the first time.  They were smokey, tender, tasty and not over sauced.  I sucked the bones clean!  And again the French Onion soup was excellent."}
{"text":"Stood there for 30 min waiting to be seated with my family on a sunday night, it was not busy~ staff passed several times without even acknowledgment. Even a blonde lady carrying menus.  Needless to say we left very unhappy our first experience there. Won't be going back ever. I also plan to tell everyone I know not to bother even trying to go. I also work in cave creek and the standards are much higher."}
{"text":"This place lives on its reputation as a Steelers bar alone.  Ordered the Primanti's Brothers knock-off.  Looked and tasted like Wonder Bread Texas Toast and Steak-ums.  The service was even worse.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"In order to avoid wasting any more of my time on Harold's, I will keep this simple. If the absolute cluster that was the 3rd of July celebration is representative of Harold's normal business operations, skip it all together. There's literally not enough space to address all of the issues we had, including but not limited to, poor service (because of understaffing, I'm hoping), no shade of any kind, and the food quality was on par with a Denny's that's about to be shut down by corporate. I have never been to the Buffalo Chip across the street, but it's not possible to top Harold's poor performance, so go there instead."}
{"text":"Great roadhuse type bar restaurant. Big menu with lots of choices. Wait staff friendly and work hard. Only thing, it gets really busy, sometimes food takes awhile. Hire more servers during peak times. Fun place with live band. Not a place for quiet romantic dinner. Food is excellent especially the steaks."}
{"text":"Disgusting food, bathrooms, service. Steak sandwich was on white bread, 2 (count em) french fries, horrible service, no parking, breakfast buffet was empty and looked like it was 3 days old, perogies were soaked in grease and rubber, never again."}
{"text":"Just relocated to the area and I am already a regular here!. The food is awesome and consistant. Order the buffalo wings - best in AZ guaranteed, Serivce is always good and it is a fun bar with live bands, great local crowd and a great atmoshere. Wait staff is on it - Ask for Collin! great dude and kept the refills coming"}
{"text":"I'm a foodie; I come here for the steaks, not the drinks or the ambience.  Their steaks are better than the chain steakhouse restaurants.   If you're looking for a fancy steakhouse, go to Ruth Chris or Mortons.  If you're looking for a cheap steak, go to Sizzlers (are they even still around?).  Here, the steaks aren't cheap, but they're cooked well and full of flavor.  Add one of their toppings (I like the mushrooms and scallions or the black peppercorn sauce options), and the steak just comes alive.  Their prime rib just melts in your mouth... but the au jus that comes with it isn't that great.  Their appetizer sampler platter is almost a full meal in itself for a small group; some very interesting interpretation of regular barfood appetizers.  I've tried several other items on their menu, and they're hit-and-miss - but it's obvious what the misses are.  (Hint:  this is the wild west... so don't bother with pasta, salad, etc.  You're also in the middle of a desert far away from the ocean and in a dusty little town in a cowboy/biker bar - why would you think to order seafood here?). They don't bother serving you water when you sit for dinner; if you want it, ask for it (something about not wasting water if no one wants it...). Ambience wise, this place just fits in with the Cave Creek feel - cowboys and bikers.  The place is huge, with a big wrap-around porch and a large dirt parking lot.  Service is a bit slow, and they obviously cater to their sports - especially the Steelers.  Some nights they have live bands that they bring in - some local, some nationally known; it's hit-and-miss - you just have to check what's happening ahead of time.   I'm not a Steeler fan, I'm not a cowboy, I'm not a biker, I don't live in Cave Creek, and I'm not a wannabe... but I do know a good steak, so I make the trek out to Harolds every now and then when I'm in the mood for one.  My most recent trip was on 2011-05-04.  Things aren't perfect (the lettuce in my salad seemed a bit wilted), but I was happy with the steak and Arizona wings, and left satisfied."}
{"text":"I recently moved to AZ from Pittsburgh and was beyond excited to go to this place! I've been here 3 times for Steelers games and have absolutely no complaints. Everyone is very friendly and it made me feel like I was back home. My waiter tonight, Tony, was incredible! Not only was he on top of everything and friendly but he called me and the people I was with by our names. I was blown away by that. There were tons of people there and for him to not only ask for my name but remember it was so cool. It made me feel like I wasn't just another customer. He is really great! I also met the owner tonight and he was so down to earth. I love this place and definitely look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Dina, our waitress is the best. Service is excellent and friendly. Orders are taken when the table is ready and presented correctly and in a timely manner. She is extremely professional. It's a pleasant experience dining at Harrold's when Dina is assigned to our table."}
{"text":"Food service very slow. A good place to visit for the local ambiance, but not a place to eat on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Always excellent prime rib on Wednesdays. I drive from 51st Avenue and Bell in Glendale to go there. The service and Foods always been top-notch thanks guys you're doing an excellent job"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic; we went back our last day because the food was so incredible.  I only deducted a star because their Bloody Mary's are just ok and the service while being prompt was not overly friendly.  There is a lot of locals here....so I get it.....but it is noticeable enough for me to comment."}
{"text":"I swear this place is run by, staffed with, employs cooks and servers, who could all fall under either the headings of \"Juggalos\" or \"Borderline retarded...\"  Never in my life have I seen somewhere with such poor services coupled with such a shit-tastic attitude of entitlement. Allow me to elaborate.  We'd gone jeeping out in the boonies by the lake. After several attempts to roll the jeep, we found level pavement, and drove into Cave Creek. Hunger, and a powerful thirst for libations had set in. We came upon Harold's.  I should have known with the number of metric cruisers in the parking lot compounded by the number of Steeler's shirts and related paraphernalia decorating the bar that we were walking into an ubiquitous shit show that only Hurricane Katrina could possibly unseat.  After 30 minutes we got water. Should have known then. After 45 minutes they took our drink orders. Should have been a sign. After 1:15 our entrees came out. But our appetizers were MIA.  They ended up comping us the appetizers, but this was after much complaining on our part and plenty of excuses, bad glares, and general attitude on the part of the wait and management staff.  I would have given Harold's 0 stars, but its not an option.   I won't be going back, and if you're smart, you'll avoid this place too."}
{"text":"Just a cute place with pretty good food! I loved sitting outside and watchng the great cars and bikes in Cave Creek. Harolds is a greasy spoon kind of a place, but that's part of the fun of it!"}
{"text":"I have been to Harold's many times over the years for breakfast with my motorcycle chapter. Last Sunday we had a reservation for 20 and called them when we were half an hour out to reconfirm and let them know we were on our way. We got there, the place was only semi-full and we were seated and then? ...15 minutes after arrival still no water or coffee offered. After 20 minutes of trying to get the attention of a waiter, half the group got up and walked out heading down the road for breakfast. After half an hour we were finally having our orders taken and all meals but one came 20 minutes later. After asking on 3 occasions as to the status of the missing meal that arrived after everyone else was finished eating. When we ordered we all ordered indicating separate or together but with only 10 of us we were amazed that it took another 30 minutes to get the bill. When the check came the waiter indicated it was one bill for the table and that was policy. So now we're up at the cash register for 15 minutes trying to sort that out and a day later finding that my credit card that I handed over for a $14 bill is charged $28. To top it all off, I had a voice mail on my cell phone from Harold's at 9.45am  inquiring if we were still planning on coming for our 8.45am reservation. I love the ride up to Cave Creek but quite frankly Harold's has some serious issues that they need to work on. I won't be returning anytime soon as there are too many good options in Cave Creek that have their act together."}
{"text":"Just got back from eating dinner tonight at Harold's.  I would have to say this was the worst experience I have had at a restaurant ever.  So bad that it has caused me to write a review, which I never do.  I'm usually very easy going and it takes a lot to make me unhappy with a restaurant, and one has never caused me to want to write a review.  I won't complain or dock them for the extremely long wait the entire night or that we never got our drinks refilled, they were very busy.   Through the Yelp app there was a 10% off coupon.  I showed it to the waitress and she said she would have to take my phone and show it to the manager.  I asked if that was necessary seeing how when our waitress left our table, it was a good 15 min before we ever saw her again and I didn't want my phone with her having who knows what happen to it.  She said she would have the manager come look at the phone, I couldn't understand why her seeing it wasn't good enough?  We sat and waited for at least 15 more min, still no manager.  The waitress finally came back and asked again to take my phone.  By this time I said fine, and prayed she would bring it back in one piece, which she did thankfully, 15 min later....  My major problem was how sneaky they were in charging us extra for all sides, including their suggested peppercorn style ($2.99 extra) on a steak.  When we ordered the waitress said nothing about anything being extra and implied it all came with our meal, including rolls that we never got.  They charged $1 extra for the baked potato which the menu said it came with the meal.  I ordered tacos, and got charged $2 extra for the rice and beans on the side (which came in a tiny side bowl and tasted nasty).  Overall we were charged $7 extra.  When I approached the waitress, she said \"It says it on the menu\".  We got a menu and turned out it did on the peppercorn and the rice and beans (in the tiniest print far from the item on the menu).  Long story short the waitress kept backpedaling knowing she and the restaurant were wrong for doing this and they finally took the charges off.  I can't imagine how much extra they make per table when a lot of people wouldn't have noticed or wouldn't wanted to deal with the long wait with the huge crowd.  Shame on you Harold's Corral"}
{"text":"What an amazing place.  During the Wild West Days, we stopped in looking to grab a quick bite as we only had 20 minutes.   We were seated immediately!    The food was great and service amazing.  Our server, Thomas E. took great care of us.  He helped us get in and out as quickly as possible.  Sure the food was wonderful, but the service was amazing!  Thanks Thomas E.    When we go back, Thomas is our man!...."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times. The first time I came here was for lunch and it was very good, But honestly I love to have breakfast here. I usually get something I believe its called the wagon wheel, which comes with eggs, choice of bacon or sausage, potatoes, and a choice of french toast or pancakes. Its a BIG breakfast, and oh so tasty! In the morning this place isn't too busy, but wait until nightfalls or a Steelers game is going on and this place gets packed!"}
{"text":"Where is Harold, he has it going on!!! Food was excellent: Stuffed Hot Peppers had some heat to them, Ceviche was good with chips and Beef Ribs smoked on premises excellent!! Beers were cold and delish. Great happy prices, do get here before 6pm."}
{"text":"I live in Cave Creek and I have been here many times over the last couple years with friends that come to visit from Oregon.  Cave Creek is a fun little town to wander around and Harold's is a fun place to take them.  The food is good not great, although both my wife and I love the salmon and being from the pacific northwest that is saying something    There is a reason the place is busy on the weekend.  It is fun and it is a destination for folks around the valley.    If you want haute cuisine go to Binkleys  up the street.  Stick to the basics, have some drinks and have fun at Harold's.  Oh, FYI on Sundays this is a Pittsburgh Steeler place.  If you get there during a game there will be  a long wait for a table unless you have a reservation.  After football season or during the week no problem.  Lots of room.  If you don't want to see dozens of adults wearing Steeler jerseys just skip Sundays during the season. Or go on the bye week.  Good food and service.  I just find anyone over 13 years old wearing an athletes jersey to be a bit disturbing.   Support local businesses wherever you live   Fuck Buffalo Wild Wings if you get my drift"}
{"text":"By far, the absolute worst meal I've had in the past three decades. I wish there was the option to give negative stars here. Confirming that it wasn't just me, or my experience, the three tables around me all sent food back, with one patron claiming her ribs were ice cold, inedible and saying they would never return. I couldn't agree more. First, the place is just filthy.  If you like a dirty sawdust joint with flies, then BOOYAH! This is the dump for you. They have cornered the market on scummy ambiance. We waited about 45 minutes for a small kids pizza and the 'chicken and chilies.' I would rate both of these just slightly lower than frozen food or week-old dumpster pickins'. The so-called pizza looked and tasted like they took a pound of velveeta, dumped it on some pieces of white bread and squirted some ketchup in between and then microwaved the whole sloppy mess. My daughter was content to eat about a 1 inch piece of crust and some of the slop and sadly declared she was done. Fast forward four hours and she was vomiting all over her bed, I'm guessing from this uncooked atrocity. Back to my horrible meal. The chicken and chilies looked uninspired and tasted worse. The chicken was gray and dry and the dish was obviously not made when I ordered it - probably sometime within the past week for sure. Tasted like the microwaves were working overtime.  Just horrible, borderline rancid food that is fairly inedible and disgusting. The only thing that seems \"legendary\" about this dump is how it hasn't been condemned yet by the Board of Health. If Harold is still alive, he should be 1. Ashamed and 2. Close this dump for the good of humanity"}
{"text":"My bf has been talking about this place for forever, and finally decided to take me :) Love it! Great food, great service and friendly people. What more could you ask for?!?! Oh, and for you uppity-types - its not at all a white tablecloth candlelight type of place... FYI..."}
{"text":"Just had the best breakfast!   I highly recommend the chicken fried steak and biscuits and gravy!!  Food was so so good and priced right! Great service (thanks again Tina!!), great atmosphere - we sat on the patio outside and enjoyed a nice cool breeze during our breakfast.  We will be back again.  :)"}
{"text":"Harold's Corral in Cave Creek, AZ , is a western style family restaurant with good food, reasonable prices, super large patios and lots of space for large and small groups.  This is one of the original Cave Creek \"joints\" with two big bars and the real deal cowboy/cowgirl vibe. It's the best and most authentic of the Cave Creek bars. The food is excellent, the servers are terrific and if you are a Pittsburg Steeler fan, you haven't lived 'til you've been to Harold's on game day.  Live music is a staple in the evenings and if you like to dance, then this is the place to be. I've  been going to Harold's since the mid 70's and it's one of my favorite restaurants anywhere. The old west decor and really cool bars make it a lot of fun to hang there. It's a great place to watch a ball game and it has a terrific, friendly staff.  My favorite bartender  is Ryann,  a daytime bartender.  She's funny, fast & friendly with a great personality.  Check out Harold's, you won't be disappointed.   Russ C., Carefree, AZ."}
{"text":"Casual bar atmosphere, good food reasonable prices, friendly helpful wait staff (Katie). Try the fish tacos, perhaps the best I've EVER had.  Great place, nice bar that tolerates kids well."}
{"text":"Not really sure what's going on here, this is my regular go to place, and though the prices have increased since my last visit in August. in my opinion the quality of the food has gone down from what it used to be.Tonight was all the pasta you could eat, and though the initial order was quick, hot, and perfectly cooked, the reorder took more than 20 minutes. I felt bad for the bartender because she checked several times with the kitchen, and kept apologizing, and it's not as if they were overly busy. Therefore the kitchen folk need to get with the program, or consider applying with McDonalds when they open this coming summer."}

{"text":"Yeeeeee, bloooooody hahhhhhhhh!!!!!  Just love this bar, attentive staff, great venues, down to earth, good people. Lot's of want-to-be- cowboys / girls etc, but who cares, just a great place to hang out, eat some inexpensive BBQ, watch, bull riding (on Fridays) and drink cheap beer...it's the American way after all.... And as a \"Brit'......I love it!!!"}

The worst part was that if they were busy I would want understand but they weren't. I am giving 3 stars as most liked the food but the fries were cold and stale. I will not return anytime soon if at all"}
{"text":"I love Harolds, but the service is probably the worst service I've ever had. Every single time I've gone, the service is freaking terrible. I come back because it's Harrolds...its a Cave Creek landmark. Train your servers better, Harrolds..  They seriously are the worst."}
{"text":"I love Harold's. I have never been able to go there at night because I have two small children. So, all I can comment on is the food quality. I LOVE it! Everything has been good. From the pizza to the roast beef. Its a great place to go, especially with a child in their terrible twos."}
{"text":"Why do I do this to myself- we had visitors so we had to do Harolds, crappy food, spotty service But FUN!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Harolds for almost 15 years. I have probably eaten every item off menu. One of my favorites is the Cajun Prime Rib. Still my favorite place to go eat and hang out."}
{"text":"Let me preface my comments by fist saying that the only reason I rated this place three stars and not one was because of the gracious and attentive service we received from the staff, from  the hostess to the server to the young man who brought us water. The place does have a kind of charming ambiance. It was clean, tables spaced nicely and the large room was well lit. On the matter of food? Whew! They've got a long way to go to reach even a three star rating for what they send from that kitchen. How disappointing. My Reuben sandwich was inedible. The corn beef was loaded with fat and was greasy. The meat part was cooked to a crisp and was rubbery. I bit down into a fatty piece and gagged. The soup of the day, chicken noodle, was so full of tomato paste it was as red as a firecracker and over salted.  Don't know if I'll be going back for any kind of meal. I will consider stopping in for a drink sometime, but only because the staff was so friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the food. We ordered a soup, it was ok but nothing made from scratch. I ordered the Fish and Chips...very greasy and bland in flavor. My husband ordered the chicken fried steak and it was not a favorite.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"18 ounce Prime rib cowboy cut was awesome! the Southwestern chicken pasta Was excellent Great service."}
{"text":"My wife and I reside in North Phoenix and head to Cave Creek a few times a month to escape the silicon valley. We've been to Harold's many times and this is unfortunately our first bad experience.   We stopped by for Sunday lunch today and sat at the bar -  first mistake! The barmaids were, well, less than organized.  One girl gave us our drinks and a menu and then disappeared for 10 minutes.  The 2nd barmaid took our order and either wasn't paying attention or entered the order incorrectly into the computer.  I never did get to see that salad that I paid for. Once our food arrived, it was all we could do to get anyone to refill our water glasses and my attempts at ordering another cocktail didn't fair any better.  I figured if they were going to ignore us, I'd put the emplty glasses at the edge of the bar to get their attention.  Yeah, that didn't matter either. So needless to say, we'll go back but it's probably going to be a few months and hopefully they're get a little more organized.  There are too many great places in Cave Creek to patronize that actually act like they want your business. By the way, if you work at Harold's and decide to go there with your boyfriend on a Sunday when you're off - it's a great idea.  You'll be the only one to actually get any service."}
{"text":"I went here for a motorcycle club meeting brunch. It was buffet-style, and really was ample on the fillin's.  My litmus test of a breakfast establishment is if they have hot sauce or not.  Harold's does.   Did you ever see that episode of the Simpson's where Homer goes to a rough outlaw bar and needs to ask a question, and can't get any attention? He smashes a glass and the whole rowdy, fighting bar stops and looks at him.  Yeah, that could be Harold's, if it were rowdy. Great for huge groups.  And make sure to check out the weirdo ceiling fans."}
{"text":"Great country music all week, combined with good food and drink. But the thing I really like is the kitchen is open late! I've had a good dinner after 11pm many times. The grilled chicken tossed salad is great."}
{"text":"This review is from a visit last January, during the week.  Took an out of town guest here for a beer because she was staying nearby.  Was ready to have to settle for a mediocre domestic beer or common import, but was shocked to find an incredible list of craft beers, including... Chimay on tap!!  This place rocks for beer.  There was also a (loud) band playing inside.  The food was mediocre, and service was mediocre but the beer alone earns it four stars!!  Be prepared to pull out your wallet for a good beer, however -  quality is not cheap!    Update - went again and this time it was karaoke night.  I don't really care for karaoke but the people were really friendly and so into it, so we stuck around for a few beers!"}
{"text":"What can I say about a place that offers the best value in town. Friday's fish fry was awesome and the wed. Prime rib awesome. I support this place 100% and have never had anything close to a bad experience."}
{"text":"I have been here many times but has been awhile. Patio tables were dirty and loaded with flies. Silver ware dirty and rusty. They need more servers. Very disappointed I brought family here from out of state, what an embarrassment."}
{"text":"Best ribs so far on this USA trip. Potato fries were not for me but Deb loved them. Her fries are always covered in tomato sauce so I really don't know how she can tell one style from another anyway. Twice fried perhaps where I'd like them less oil and more potato flavor going on.  Waiter was super friendly. The sheriff was eating here with his deputy. Must be good.  Deb had baked cheesecake that was loaded with cherries. Waiter told us it was so you'd get one cherry for each mouthful of cheesecake. Deb was a very happy girl."}
{"text":"Been going to Harolds for years and can't say enough great things about this place they have a great menu and we love the Fridaynight fish fry, wings and the brisket to name a few. Music is always great if you like country and many places to sit. The service could be a little better waiters and waitresses seem to disappear for awhile."}
{"text":"Eh! This is a very busy place because it is large and in Cave Creek, but I have to say, I have given this 2 try and won't go back! The service is very slow and the food was basically on the level of bar food! Mediocre at best! Maybe I didn't order the right thing, but I asked the server what was good, she said everything.  Oh well, you can't win them all!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came to visit from Southern California and we a good experience. The food wasn't amazing but the atmosphere was definitely a good one!"}
{"text":"I go to Harolds a lot, and have been going for about a decade. It's a classic old time Cowboy bar, and at times can have the best ambiance in town. It is a huge place, and sometimes that makes it lose it's charm, especially since the depression. The inside is  a mixture of dance floor, stage, and a new bar with the original bar near the door. The menu is large and they have everything from steak to Mexican, to Italian. Personally I love the burgers and the Pulled Pork. They usually have a band playing on weekends, and a variety of a crowd. The outside patio is great, and the fireworks on the 4th are top notch. Great Breakfast too....."}
{"text":"Within 24 hours of posting my review someone from Harold's contacted me and offered me a total refund on our concert tickets. I did ask to be refunded for the \"VIP\" up charge since I did enjoy the concert and I wasn't writing the review to get refunded. He said he would credit us the difference between general admissions and the VIP charge. It ended up being a charge of $20 per ticket.  He noted that they don't make any extra money on the service charge or parking. I did appreciate that they were concerned with our customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"Great place but I'm only giving 4 stars because the chicken sandwich I ate tasted weird. I'm not picky but it tasted like a bad piece of chicken."}
{"text":"Showed up for a late Saturday breakfast and we where promptly created and seated.  While the initial service was a bit sluggish, it was followed up with quickly.  Drinks where served, meals delivered and the food was as great.  Had a great time and will definatly return when back in town."}
{"text":"Dinner and music for 4.  This place was packed.  The food is always great and our new waitress did a great job!  The band rocked the house as usual (Mogollon) and the people watching was top notch.    We come here several times a year and it is always worth the drive."}
{"text":"First time at Harold's and I wish I lived closer.  This is my kind of place.  Full menu, nice beer selection, FANTASTIC staff, sports on TV, and a live band with dance floor.  Put all of these attributes together and add in fun decor and it's a home run!  Thank you Mason for top-notch service and Amanda for additional support.  This is a high point of our vacation.  This is a Pittsburgh Steelers bar and proud of it."}
{"text":"Amanda, our server, was extremely helpful in finding us a table during one of their must fun and busy days (during a steelers game) and was attentive to us continuously. We had a great time and because of that attended the New Years party there. Tons of fun and a big thanks to Amanda for that."}
{"text":"My Daughter came to visit us for Labor Day weekend from L.A. We Brought her here for lunch, and she absolutely loved it. Everybody at Harold's is so friendly, and the western type saloon atmosphere was a big hit, but their food is the star of the show. Absolutely amazing quality and flavor. Everything was AWESOME, and well worth the drive to Cave Creek."}
{"text":"If you want the best prime rib in the valley, go to Harolds on a Wednesday night for the special. It is succulent and wonderful. The wait staff is very good, though now that we've been going for awhile it may be because they recognize us and we take good care of them, too.   I've had steak sandwiches, the fish fry and the salad there. All are pretty good. It's an extensive menu, so you can find just about anything. Hamburgers are delicious. If you get a salad, always ask for dressing on the side. Depending on who is in the kitchen, you might get it drowned in dressing otherwise ;)  They have great bands if you're into country/rockabilly/rock music. It depends on which night you go. Old timey saloon. Definitely a place to go if you are an out of towner and want some local color."}
{"text":"2 hours to be served an appetizer and a drink.  I'm a celiac and the wings say nothing about breading as in the photo, but they are.  server wasn't even aware that Tito also was a tiquilla.   horrible service.  But great wings once they finally brought them out NOT breaded.  Drinks tasted watered down."}
{"text":"Tried Harold's after a day of cruising through this part of town and when the restaurant across the street could not accommodate a person in a wheelchair who was with us.  It was humiliating for him so we convinced him to try Harold's because the tables were low enough to accommodate him.  He actually just wanted to go home.   We ordered the Hangover burger which came with hash browns And french fries.  Don't know why we ordered it but I think it was the egg on top that swayed us.  Next time just a cheeseburger with an egg and that will suffice. The meat was good and nicely prepared but the bun was super huge so the bread to meat ratio was totally off.  I had the chili topped with onions and cheese.  Came with a massive amount of chips.  Chili was good.  Also had the fish and chips (cod), just two pieces but the fish was thick and delicious.  The french fries that came with it were exactly as we ordered them, well done and crispy.  The scary part was the cole-slaw that came with it.  Looked unusually dark and wilted and when I tried it, I spit it out.  NO BUENO.  Someone at our table who works in restaurants ask me why I would even venture to eat that.  He said, Don't you know that most restaurants dump uneaten cole slaw back into the cole slaw bucket?  The thought had not cross my mind and I choose to believe that Harold's doesn't do that.  But I will say that the cole slaw should have been thrown out.  Another dish was the vegetarian pasta with chicken.  They forgot the chicken.  At $18 plus tax and tip, they should not have forgotten the chicken.  When the grilled chicken did arrive, it was cold but my guests were just grateful that it did arrive.   It wasn't a stellar lunch but it sufficed.   Thanks to the management for having ramps and most of all tables that can accommodate those who are unable to walk."}
{"text":"Wow just did the breakfast with Nancy and Lisa \" Killer\" scrambled eggs with cheese and ham my buddy Geno had eggs over with bacon the potatoes were also amazing and manager Margaret  was so friendly best breakfast in AZ !!"}
{"text":"Mindy Harris was amazing Friday night. Sings Miranda Lambert as well as Miranda herself. Harrolds ALWAYS get the best bands in Arizona to play there. Young Country, Mogollon, Crown King, and now I would add Mindy Harris to the list.   LOVE THIS PLACE!  P. S. Unfortunately Young Country has joined Mogollon in believing the louder the music the better:-( Management should ask BOTH bands to turn it down."}
{"text":"We always enjoy listening to the live bands at  Harold's on the weekends.  This time, after spending the night in Cave Creek, we decided to try their Sunday breakfast buffet.   We headed over about 9am to make sure we had plenty of time to eat and relax. When we got there we were greeted by the hostess. They had a moderate amount of people but weren't crowded, and she took us to our table right away. She gave us menus. Our server came over within a few minutes with big glasses of ice water. Already a good sign. We ordered coffee and told her we wanted the buffet. She brought our coffee and plates promptly.  The buffet consisted of a long table covered in a red and white tablecloth with large warming trays on top. It didn't seem very impressive at first until we started filling our plates with the various foods. There were scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, biscuits and gravy, bacon, large sausages, blintzes, thick-cut french toast and a few more things. They also had strawberry and blueberry toppings for the French toast and a tray of fresh cantaloupe.  I would like to have had some other choices of fruit since cantaloupe isn't my favorite and maybe some cheese to put on my eggs. The biscuits were on the dry side but nothing a little gravy wouldn't take care of,  Everything was hot and delicious. Our server came back several times to refill  the water and coffee. The coffee was very good. Another plus.   It was a great way to wake up and start the day. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Harold's Corral on our first visit to Cave Creek. We had outstanding service from our waiter from start to finish, beginning with some great advice on their beer choices. I had their excellent fish and chips, while my wife had their extra fresh salad with perfectly grilled salmon.   The biggest surprise of the meal was a slice of their chocolate cake to share. It arrived at our table in a to-go box with two plastic forks. The box was heavy! We ate about 1/4 of it and boxed up the rest to put in our freezer. We had it for dessert for three more meals at home. The huge and moist 3-layer cake slice was iced with a perfect chocolate spread that made it as good as any chocolate cake we have ever eaten anywhere.   Harold's Corral is a large facility, with walls covered in interesting Western artifacts, posters, and photos of colorful characters who have been there over the years. They also had tasteful memorials for recently departed loyal customers. We wish Harold's had a restaurant across the street from us in Old Town Scottsdale. It's a fun, lively, memorable place we will return to in the years ahead."}
{"text":"If you are a Pittsburgh Steelers fan this is the place for you!  I personally couldn't care less about football, however my friend is a huge fan.  We took her out to this bar on a Sunday morning/afternoon during a game and she loved it!  For as crowded as it was, the service was excellent and our waitress was super friendly.  The menu is huge and the food was also really good.  They had everything from a breakfast buffet to nachos.  I sampled my husband's waffles from the buffet and they were tasty.  The nachos were good as well.  If you want to get a seat here during a game call a week or so ahead of time and get a reservation.  Otherwise I doubt you will get a seat!  This place is quite big, but it does get packed during games.  I think it is a great place for Steelers fans to get together to watch their team."}
{"text":"The food is good, I usually go with the bbq. Only bad thing I can think of is the wait.  I think they take entirely too long to serve the food.  They have big portions and the prices are very decent. The hosts don't seem very outgoing or friendly probably just young girls who really don't need to work, but the servers definetly are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We loved Harold's  the food was great , service was just right, not to fast , not to slow.... Six in our party and we all had a great time.... We would love to go more often but it's an hour drive for us...  My husband and I had the prime rib, which was excellent , well seasoned, tender and very juicy.... We also loved the cauliflower soup, wish it came in a bigger bowl....  The whole experience was very entertaining and nothing beats good food, good friends, adds up to a wonderful time...."}
{"text":"Great fun. Great food. Best food in cave creek. Ask any local. I bring lots of visitors to Harold's and they all love the food and experience.  Amanda the manager is  . Very nice and accommodating.    Real sweetheart"}
{"text":"A great place. Lots of variety. Good food. If you have visitors in town, its a good place to go, but it can get noisy at times."}
{"text":"We took our daughter in law  for her birthday on 10/1 and the food was terrible.  We have been going to Harolds for about 40 year. We take friends from out of state there also.  We had the prime rib and it was not good.  The meat was very stringy and no taste.  We ordered ours medium and they brought it out medium rare. The kid that brought it said he made a mistake and took it away only to bring it back out.  My wife and son also had the same thing. The manager came over after I requested her and took off 1 meal and a round of drinks (big deal).  With the Buffalo Chip being rebuilt and a few more restaurants going up they may have more problems if they don't fix what ever is wrong. As we were leaving I noticed the manager adjusting another check with the man by us that was also eating the prime rib.  They advertise prime rib for Saturdays and I think Wednesday's also. If you go we would not recommend this for your dinner."}
{"text":"There is not much to do in Cave Creek. I consider Harrold's to be a great place to go for a little break. They have a great happy hour from 4-6 with 1$ small drafts and appetizers (2 tacos, 2 sliders, 2 beef ribs, 6 wings or a cheese crisp) 2$ domestic bottles and 3$ large drafts. Always good service by friendly staff. The food is pretty tasty and they usually have some evening live entertainment going on. Not to mention off the track betting for gamblers."}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos, supposedly the owners favorite,  had an awesome sauce. Spinach salad was great,  bacon dressing was delish.  Service was fantastic too.  My son got the mini corndogs, which actually turned out to be two full size Corn dogs, a great deal for $6. Live music,  huge outdoor patio and great menu!"}
{"text":"Oh Hell Yeah!  I'm a Jet fan through and through, but when my buddy and his family (mostly Steelers fans) came through town I had to join them at Harold's for the experience.  This is THE Steeler's bar! They have Iron City Brew, killer burgers and the most loyal Steeler fans ever!  The service is pretty good, even on a crowded Monday night game!   This isn't a fancy joint. It's not the nicest joint, but it is one of the best. The vibe is an old timer's biker country-style bar. TV's everywhere, so you don't have to strain your neck, a gigantic patio, and a pretty diverse menu. Something for everyone.  BY THE WAY...If you have an awesome baby like my friend Carey...bring him/her. This place is baby friendly...as long as your babe is a Steeler fan."}
{"text":"It's okay - the atmosphere is fun. The food was pretty blah - I think you'd only come here if you were kind of desperate after walking around all the shops. The salad was all wilted and stale, the spaghetti was obviously out of a jar from Sams club, the pork chops were very bland, the ribs were meh."}
{"text":"Morgan was great best breakfast in cave creek . Harolds is a lot of fun at night and always a good time"}
{"text":"Food is great, menu is large, service is good, friendly staff. Reasonable prices and best Steelers bar outside of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"You have to be a true Cave Creek, Carefree, Scottsdale person to really get and enjoy Harold's! That means you could be a Harley Rider, True Cowboys, or A Driver of a $250,000.00 Bentley and they all come together to drink and eat some of the most awesome food and service together in peace and harmony! Now that is Harold's!! Go to breakfast and have the breakfast calzone and you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The food was good however, will NEVER return after I realized they charged an additional fee to our bill due to some state proposition.  The part that annoys me most is this \"fee\" was on the menu in exceptionally small print that no one can see !  So, we asked our waiter what is was, he could not explain so we talked to the manager and expressed our thoughts.  Increase your menu prices but don't charge some non-mandatory ridiculous fee.  We should have left when there was a parking lot attendant who told us it would be $10 to park......if I want extra fees & crazy parking, I will stay in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"This place is great for Steeler fans (my sister is a big fan). The memorabilia is cool and the ambiance is fun and laid back. i try to order the pork chop and gauge them amongst diners/grills and this one-while juicy, was small especially for the \"steak house\" price. The mashed potato has a \"plasticky\" taste and was only edible with the brown gravy. My nephew's french fries came out stale and cold, and the reorder of fresh fries came after he has finished his pulled pork sandwich. it was an ok place with these as exceptions. i will try to go again and update"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. If you are a Steelers fan, Harold's is the place to go. Food is good- nachos, wings, and the dips are amazing! Bartender Charlie & Sean are amazing! Haven't had problems at this bar minus a couple rude bartenderS here and there! Will continue to visit!"}
{"text":"Single Women STAY AWAY... my friend was recently Ruffied there. (Friday 11/23/2012)  With a few friends, the bartender \"bought\" their first round for them.. noone handled her drink besides her... fortunately she was with good friends that took care of her and got her home while she got violently ill and lost all memory after drinking one full drink... clearly the bar tender was in on it.  Pathetic and evil, she is a single mom and rarely goes out at all."}
{"text":"I went to lunch with a friend to Harold's Corral on 7/27/17. I love Cave Creek however the restaurants are another story. I arrived after my friend and she had her drink. It took the server 10 minutes to take my drink order. I ordered the Monterey Grilled  Chicken which came with fries. I asked if I could substitute fruit or vegetables instead of fries and server said I would have to pay extra. She wasn't a pleasant or accommodating server. My friend ordered the Fish on a Dish with fries and cole slaw.The food took almost 20 minutes and there were only 4 tables in the restaurant. There were some people at the bar however they weren't all eating. My sandwich was good even though I had to have fries. My guest said fish was okay but cole slaw tasted old. Server never checked on us till we were almost done. She never smiled and wasn't friendly. The other servers in the restaurant never smiled or were friendly. The bartenders smiled and were friendly with their patrons. We were sitting close to the bar. The restaurant has a western theme which is similar to the town. I might return for the atmosphere however service and food another story. I could overlook some food issues if the servers were somewhat friendly."}
{"text":"Freakin' rad place.  I came here for a concert (DAC) at night and I thought it was a pretty sweet venue.. not too big and not too small.    The staff/bartenders seemed friendly and responsive as far as I could tell.    We ordered some pizza before the main act went on and it was actually pretty damn good.. I was expecting subpar bar food and was pleasantly surprised.  I live in California but If I ever get a chance to go back I most likely will."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and really felt they deserve this review. Great place for a cold beer and delicious food. Friendly environment with nice employees that always take care of you. Owners are always around making the customers feel at home as well."}
{"text":"Gigantic pizza breadsticks and the Prop 206 upcharge were the highlights here on a very empty weekend day. Yes, the prop 206 upcharge is a real thing and it cost me a few bucks on this bill. Not really a fan of this extra charge. Raise the food prices on a few items or firing some employees would be a better decision.      Those pizza sticks were unusually large we were told and rolled by hand. It was basically two giant sticks of dough stuffed with cheese and some pepperoni. They were no greasy and had a good taste, but very filling. They were also half price from 3-7 every day. The southwest burger was missing several ingredients, but the meat itself was solid and tasted fresh ground. A pretty good burger and still usually a good dining experience despite this new upcharge crap."}
{"text":"Harold's is the perfect example of country meeting city! From dinner and dancing to Steelers Sunday's, it's always a great time!"}
{"text":"This place is super fun when you need to get out of PHNX..but cant afford a vacay!  Its usually a few degrees cooler, it feels like you are out of the city, and you can bar hop!  The food is decent if your drinking its perfect.  The place is huge. I got the steak sandwich. The French fries come inside of it!   If you have a pair of boots.. you should wear em!"}
{"text":"Chicago bears games are fun to attend almost as good as sitting at Soldier Field.                                  F"}
{"text":"Wish that I could say nice things about more items, but my beer is always cold & the BBQ beef ribs with the Combo are awesome! I just don't eat anything else there. Other than the popcorn that is always warm that is good too."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how to describe this place.  We have been coming here for years, mostly for breakfast and a few times for school fundraisers.  The food is OK, the only reason I would bring guests here is so they feel like they ate at a touristy place while they were visiting.  All the pictures on the walls show people having a good time during Halloween and drunen nights, or possibly just a Sunday afternoon. And it looks like some celebrities have stopped by too.  There's always a few locals bellied up to the bar, you can tell by the conversations they have with the barkeeps. We were in there the day we heard that Cavecreek was voted Arizona's most redneck city. I'm not sure how the locals felt about that. If you read the local paper you would know they certainly don't label themselves rednecks in that neck of the woods.  The servings are big, so be sure you take your appetite. Beer is cold which is a good thing."}
{"text":"Great time! Love the atmosphere!! Ryan (security) made my night! Super friendly and looks like he really loves his job!"}
{"text":"Our first  (and last time) in this restaurant We waited over 45 minutes between ordering and service. It was Sunday evening and there were 10 people in the restaurant. I can't imagine when the restaurant is full. I ordered a medium rare steak, it was overcooked. My kids ordered a pizza and pesto pasta alfredo. Everything was full of fat. Pizza was a sponge full of oil.  They didn't eat anything  Only the taco of my wife and my budlight were ok !!  We tried Harold one but we won't return fir sure. They claim to be the best restaurant in town. I'm afraid to try the other restaurant in town"}
{"text":"Our crew rolled in here the other day, after a beer at the nearby Hideaway.  Harold's has always been a favorite spot for me, when cruising around the north end of town, because of the solid service (especially from the oh so very lovely Angelina), delicious food, yummy beer options and outdoor seating.  My only gripe, is the quality of their fried calamari.  Considering the price they charge for it, the quantity should be more and the pea sized rings should be bigger.  The smaller rings are indicative of lower/cheaper quality.  Go check out Harold's.  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Excellent service, outstanding meals, very fresh and flavorful. Prices are dynamite. Atmosphere was very Arizona and took you back in time to when the cowboy would saunter in at the end of that day and order a whiskey and have dinner as well.   Five stars aren't enough for our visit!!!!!   Will definitely be visiting Again"}
{"text":"After a long morning of riding dune buggies through the desert trails, we stopped off at Harold's Cave Creek Corral for a quick lunch before heading back to our rental house... at least the plan was to just have a quick lunch, but that soon changed.   As soon as we sat down we were greeted by a friendly waitress who immediately took our drink orders, everything seemed ok up to this point. The drinks came out fairly quickly and a few of the guys that had gotten there early had ordered appetizers for the whole table, which also came out fast.... but then another table was seated in our section.   Apparently the restaurant can hold about 200 people, but as soon as more than 20 are seated the whole place falls apart. We didn't see our waitress for another 30 minutes or so as she frantically ran around to all the tables at the other side of the restaurant. We eventually had to go up and ask another waitress to inform our waitress that we had every intention of eating lunch, but she was making it quite hard to sit there any longer. I guess the threat of a table of 10 guys leaving was enough for her to check on us again and take our food order.   The food came out in a decent amount of time, but I don't think everyone was happy with that they got. The meatball calzone was apparently delicious, my BBQ Beef Sandwich was decent, but my brother's steak sandwich was absolutely terrible. So with terrible service and semi-decent food, we decided to ask for our check before we even finished eating (as we weren't sure we'd ever see our waitress again).   By the time the check came, the local pink-shirt-top-hat-wearing-drunk had made his way into the restaurant and made his way over to our table. I can't complain about that as we called him over and he was harmless. He told us a terrible joke and laughed at us as we got up and made our way out of the restaurant.   The only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because my food was decent and the calzone was incredible. The service was horrendous when the place was empty so I can't imagine it when it's full... Hopefully they are better staffed during normal busy hours, but I still can't recommend this place. There are a bunch of other places in the area I'm sure you'd be better off eating at."}
{"text":"Food and Happy hour were great. Ended up staying for 4 hours. Friday nights are real fun. Jourdan  took great care of us."}
{"text":"The place would have been OK if the bartenders weren't Pm'sing. There were two girls working that have no business being behind a bar. My friends and I were greeted by a tall beautiful brunette. With that being said that will be her only compliment, this girl was rude, surly and just down right mean. We actually felt intimidated to ask for another beer, we didn't want to inconvenience her while she cleaned with a down right hateful scorn to her face. It's a shame too, this town seemed to be like something out of a wild west movie. That was pretty cool, however I can assure you we will not be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Raking it five star for a great experience this morning. I ordered a very simple egg any style with potato fries ( not the usual ;) and toast. I  am not a potato eater but I enjoyed them completely. Lots of flavor and over all everything cooked perfectly. Great cowboy country experience as well."}
{"text":"Love the food at Harold's, the large menu, the atmosphere, the great service, and the fact that it shares a parking lot with Buffalo Chip so it's easy to mosey on over for bull riding after a good dinner. Buffalo Chip has mediocre food, a tiny menu, and bad food service if you get there too late and it's super busy.  Harold's has a large dining area and a wonderfully large menu. While most of it looks vegetarian, I found out when researching rehearsal dinner places that many of the sauces have some kind of meat stock in them, making it unvegetarian. The server we had for dinner was really nice, prompt, and helpful. The menu has a ton of different choices like regular bar food, mexican food, tons of bbq, pizza, pastas, and burgers/sandwiches. The salads are fresh, the bbq sauce is amazing, and they serve warm, soft bread rolls with just about everything.  The inside has a charming western feel and doesn't get too crowded feeling even when there are a lot of people because the rooms are quite large. The patio is really nice with a ton of misters, a beautiful view of mountains & cactus, and is sunset-facing.   I definitely recommend getting dinner & drinks here and then heading over to the Buffalo Chip for Friday night bull riding."}
{"text":"Always a good time and delicious breakfast at Harold's!  Fast and friendly service.  The Sunday buffet is well done and typical variety.  Absolutely love the french toast"}
{"text":"Great place for music but the food is below average and the service is awful!  We live a mile away and come here often because its close but the hostesses are always unorganized and no matter if there's ten people in the place we end up waiting 15-20 minutes to be sat for dinner and another 15 minutes to order a drink. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon. The place was semi-full. I loved looking at the cowboy boots that graced the rafters. The place is very spacious. I can only image how the weekends look when there's a band playing.   I couldn't decide on the Ruben, Philly cheese steak, or beef brisket... Finally, I chose the brisket, salad, and loaded baked potato. My goodness, it was a lot of food! The brisket was so tender, I cut it with my fork. I didn't get to sample the rolls because the waitress (very friendly) forgot to bring them to the table until after I had thrown in the towel. No worries tho... when I left here my stomach was sitting in my lap! You will definitely crave a toothpick after eating here!!!   I know that it's a drive, but I'd go back! ;-)"}
{"text":"My husband loves Friday night fish fry, i love the southwestern burger. We have been often on Friday nights, and was great. November 8th, Sunday at 6 there were 5 of us, we were told small music group, not loud.  Not only was the music so loud conversation was impossible without yelling but the group should get a day job because the vocalist nasally screamed and yelled. It was nerve racking to have to listen to him. The manager did ask them to turn it down but the lead would have been just about as obnoxious without a mic. The group were so clueless that they did not realize people were leaving because of them. The owner should ask the staff, they are the ones that listen to the customer complaints. Marilyn, Martha, jackie and husbands."}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere! Great service! Must try the southwest eggs. It comes with a Homemade spicy hollandaise."}
{"text":"We are from Pittsburgh and had to stop by Harold's for some drinks and a bite to eat. Our server Lynn, was outstanding. She was very helpful with explaining the menu and happy hour specials. She made our time here really enjoyable, and would recommend asking for Lynn on your next visit to Harold's. Go Steelers."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast for the 1st time this morning with my hubby. I had Eggs Southwest and he had Chicken Fried Steak. Both were delish and we loved the potatoes they served with our meals. I ordered a Bloody Mary and it was descent, I've definitely had better. Our server was friendly and efficient. Overall a good breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Great place for a cold one after a round of golf or anything. Friendly staff tv's everywhere. Only complaint was the nachos, they were average"}
{"text":"If I could give this place \"Zero\" stars I would! I was there with my girlfriend on 01/28/16 after a round of golf. Having been there before and knowing it was a Steelers bar, and my girlfriend visiting from Pittsburgh, what better of a place to take her.   We sat at the bar at approx 5:00pm and it took several minutes to get someone's attention, although the place was not that busy and the bar was not full.   Finally a snotty girl comes yep and asks what we want, and practically throws the menu and Happy Hour menu at us. We ordered a couple drinks before we looked over the menu. I already knew I wanted the Fried Chicken and my girlfriend got the Bleu Cheese burger.   Since all I eat is the breast, I asked for just two breasts, that's all. The bitch bartender says \" well that's not how it comes, you either order a half chicken or or a whole chicken\" I told her I don't want a whole chicken, just two breasts, I'll pay extra, just give me two breasts\" She says Nope can't do it, either whole or half, that's it! So I said \" Forget it, I'll have Spaghetti, which was $2.00 less than the half chicken.   Then they brought out place mats and silverware and set them down where we were at. We got up as my girlfriend wanted to get some photos near the Steelers signs and banners, and while we were away, they picked up the placemats and silverware along with our 1/2 empty drinks and removed everything from the bar. When we returned to our spot and made inquiry about our spot, they said \" Oh we thought you left! \" Who the hell orders food and then just leaves.   Then some 25 year old female manager comes by and asks what the problem is, so I told her. She was absolutely no help and gave me the card of the owner \"Danny\" and said to call him if you have a problem.  I called Dan that night and he pretty much told me \" well that's the way we serve it and there's no exceptions\" I asked him if a current Steelers player came in and wanted just two breasts what would happen? Dan said he wouldn't serve it that way to anyone - Bullshit! I felt like he was telling me if you don't like it go somewhere else! Next time - that's what I'll do. Go to The Horny Toad for chicken in the future!"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. It took over an hour for our meals, our meal was cold and not very good and our waiter made countless mistakes. We paid $40 for two sandwiches and 1 drink due to a surcharge the restaurant invented due to increased minimum wage. In all, don't waste your time on the towns dump."}
{"text":"Went back again and this time French toast wasn't as good. Not as much sauce and loaded with raisins on it. Other people had the buffet and it was ok. Most of the food was too dried out."}
{"text":"Both meals we ordered arrived burnt to our table after waiting 30 minutes.  Ordered a cajun beef sandwich and the Rachel, which was missing the sauerkraut and have grill marks all over the turkey.  They were sent back and we instead ordered 2 basic burgers with lettuce and tomato, which came out overcooked and had one tiny tomato on each.  These were sent back, as well, and we then spoke to the manager.  We got a free Coke out of the deal, but never did she offer to comp us for 4 disastrous orders.  I think we will hang our spurs when it comes to going to Harolds again."}
{"text":"We had Mohther's Day dinner at Harold's because mom wanted a good chicken dinner with mashed potatoes.  Finally.......when our dinner arrived the chicken looked like what you would over nuke in a TV dinner!!!!!  The breast was like leather and the mashed potatoes tasted like what a dirty refrigerator smells like.  Husbands ribs were tough and over cooked (nuked).  Daughter had a chicken pollo and it had veg-all in it!!!  What gave this a star, were the rolls, they were terrific!  Won't be back"}
{"text":"This is a great place to bring out of town guests. A rustic western restaurant with full bar,off track betting and live music stage.great menu with a lot of options from pizza to Prime rib."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night and the food was good. I had the stuffed breadsticks and they were awesome.You could tell the dough was homemade. I also ordered a Acai- Mango Mojito, Wasnt the best, lacked flavor."}
{"text":"So sad-This was our second time here. First time was great so we went back with a party of 6 and is was horrible. Food was cold, service super slow, dirty dishes everywhere and not enough help. Took 2 hours and 40 minutes to eat."}
{"text":"We have lived in Cave Creek over 20 years and we have watched Harold's become a great restaurant and bar.  The service and food are top notch.  I wish I could remember all of the servers names, because almost all of them are top notch!  We especially love Angela D.!  We always ask for her, if we can and if she is available.  She always goes out of her way to get us exactly what we want.  My husband always has special requests and she always makes it happen without complaint and with a smile, and remembers every time!.  (Brewed unsweetened iced tea, salad with lettuce & onions only and red wine vinegar and oil, med-rare prime rib)  We really appreciate her!  We always come in late after our work day and she always has a smile :)  Thanks Angela!  Anyway, I only write reviews when they are deserved and I always recommend Harold's as the go to in Cave Creek.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Our service was extremely slow. We had awful food. As a family one out of our 10 people had a some what good meal which was the cheese burger. All of our food was cold and the chili was rock solid with some mysterious juices. The bathrooms looked like a dump and they has no  respect for personal hygiene. And at this point my  thumbs hurt from writing this review and don't forget our stomachs."}
{"text":"Love the place. It is a fun relaxing place where you can let your hair down and enjoy some better then average casual dining. The decor is eclectic and the mix of people make it an interesting place to people watch. Only been there for dinner never of any event or to watch a Steelers game. If you do not live close it is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Harolds is our go to bar.  It's always just the right amount of busy.  They have great live music.  Drinks  are reasonably priced - $4-$5 a beer.  Bartenders are also really friendly.  The food is great too!  Had the Mexican Pizza this time and it was delicious!  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Excited to check out one of the events they post on Facebook one day.  If your visiting or live in the area definitely check out Harolds!"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best, they keep all of the doors open during the summer, the restrooms are a disaster and the beer could be a little colder. Fine for a bar...not so much for a restaurant.  It was a mess behind the bar and my husband saw an employee leave the restroom without washing his hands."}
{"text":"This place is good for breakfast, lunch, happy hour and dinner. If you're in Cave Creek AZ and looking for a casual place for good food and cold drinks, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was average at best. Service was pretty bad, but not for lack of trying on the waitress's part. They seemed very understaffed during their advertised happy hour. Prices were high for the quality and taste of food."}
{"text":"Carrie was an amazing server! She was so personable and made our dinner with family fun. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was good. The place definitely had a country theme that most places in the town have. Food was ok.  They had live music starting at about eight Saturday night. It wasn't bad. I got the country fried steak. Mash potatoes were cold when they brought out the dish but the steak was warm. The gravy wasn't that good. I love white gravy and felt let down since is covered everything. I would have rated it higher if the food either tasted better or was cheaper. The price didn't fit the quality. Seems like the night life part of it is kickin' and worth checking out."}
{"text":"Angelina & Jared have been awesome & fixed our sodas when they are flat. it's been an awesome experience!!!"}
{"text":"Decent... food and servers were great!  However, past guests food sits out for longer than expected time... the table bus people just wipe the tables down and let food fall onto the floors... front reservation people lean over playing on their cell phones and takes awhile to get checked out...  there was also a guy casually walking around in a security T-shirt, but honestly looked like he was just walking around getting exercise in the restaurant, no real enforcement here!    The website prices do not reflect the increased prices on the paper menus, fortunately they matched the price for me!   The worst part of our visit was the restaurant purposely left both the front and back food open and it was only 57F outside, we were cold!!  All because of a cornhole tournament in the back!  Bring a jacket with you!"}
{"text":"We were with a large group (10) and service definitely had room for improvement. Empty glasses and staggered food delivery. Food was ok. My first time to the area, would probably check out other places next time."}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere and the live band was amazing! The food and beer menu was great- very large selection. The place was packed on a Saturday night, our server was attentive as far as stopping by but got a few things wrong. I ordered the shrimp tacos and ended up with the fish tacos, they were good and I didn't mind hence why I didn't say anything. We also had to ask for water a few times prior to receiving a glass. Also someone else with me was supposed to get a salad that never came. Aside from that, this place is a good time and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for the super bowl while in town. Food was great, drinks were on par. It was my second time coming and every time it's been a good time. We had the Buffett, which included wings, salad, ribs, chicken, baked ziti, roasted sirloin and brats. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Sat out on the patio this morning had some very good food and nice cool breeze getting hot quick welcomed Arizona"}
{"text":"This place is dying. Shot specials at 5.75 a shot? Im from pit and will never come back here. Place is crazy expensive and was not busy. Better off at applebees"}
{"text":"Been here many times and it's always the same. Slow, confused service. I only go back because other Cave Creek bars aren't much better. Now with Oregano's opening I don't see myself coming back to Harold's anytime soon."}
{"text":"All I can say is if you are a Die Hard Steeler Fan you will absolutely love this place.  How much better can you get than being at a Steeler Bar on playoff weekend, watching your Steelers kick Miami's butt with 100's and I mean 100's of Steeler Nation.  It's outside of Phoenix in a place called Cave Creek which was cool just driving through.  I seriously feel like I drove through the OK Corral and it was awesome! Incredible views, great staff, excellent Atmosphere, great food, they had an All-U-Can Eat Buffet for lunch and the food was excellent.  Too any cool things to write about, it would take me all night!  Go try it out whether you are a Steeler Fan or not!"}
{"text":"This review is for their annual luau  I have not eaten at this establishment on a normal night, and can not comment on that.  Sooo, the luau. It was disorganized.  The food was brought out buffet style and hundreds of people rushed the table leading to a gigantic and very slow moving line.  By the time we made it up to the food table, everything was picked through and looked like a tornado went through it.  Drinks were not included, bu tthey did have cheap and tasty Mai Tais.  For the food we got to eat, I wasn't too impressed.   The beef ribs were way to fatty. The pork was so fatty I found the section I was given to be inedible. The corn on the cob was my favorite part.  So I spent around $40 to eat two ears of corn and a few drinks.  Le sigh. More organization and better food is needed for this event! I demand it!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Relaxed family atmosphere... Doesn't matter if it's lunch, dinner, or the Sunday Buffet...always great! Hats off to Danny, he runs a great place."}
{"text":"We went in for breakfast, had the thick cut french toast. It was very good, perfect for me and my son to share. Would not bring a kid here for dinner, it is pretty much a cowboy bar. Had a lot of character, fun decorations. The schedule that I saw had live bands several evenings a week and looked like a fun event for St. Patty's day.  We'd love to come back."}
{"text":"Love it here. Love the vibe. Love listening to the bands.  Food is decent. Nice large bar.  Well definitely be back.  Oh yeah, and free popcorn!!"}
{"text":"On travel from Pittsburgh for work, I stumbled across Harold's and enjoyed the Smokehouse Combo!   Plenty of good smoked meats on that plate with a loaded potato and salad!   If you stop here to eat and leave hungry... Join eaters anonymous!!  The BIG Bonus is that Harold's Corral is a Steeler Bar!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be part of a little secret place that locals knew about where you could get some good chow at a reasonable price. As with the rest of Cave Creek, the quality slipped as it became a popular hipster art commune area. The service is hit or miss and the food is alright. It's nothing to drive to though if you don't live in town. They also do a breakfast buffet, but that too is nothing to write home about. I wouldn't recommend it past the novelty of a first time visit, just make sure it's never on a game day for the Anti-American Football League. Traffic, parking, and seating are a nightmare on game days/nights."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday night with some friends for a drink and to listen to some music. I had heard this place was mostly for the country lovers but when I went they had a fun rock band that did cover songs. Lots of people dancing the night away until about 1pm (it's a slightly older crowd; 40's-50's from what I could see). Had a good time and drink prices were fair. Didn't try the food; maybe next time."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast too! We also love the fried chicken for dinner. Harolds also does a lot to support the community by holding fundraisers for the local high school, elementary schools and more!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is great. Food typical bar food except for great salmon dinner. Very casual and relaxed setting. Service is good. Great cowboy bar experience."}
{"text":"I might have been a little quick to write the poor review based on them not taking reservations for a party of 9. The person answering the phone did not offer any options. We stopped by and there wasn't even a wait but most tables were occupied. Everyone enjoyed their food. I ordered the Strip steak peppercorn style. I thought it was a dry rub but it was served with mushroom gravy which I didn't care for. The manager then offered to replace with the dry rub. The service was okay and not great this time thus the 4 stars. Everyone was very friendly though."}
{"text":"Yee-haw! A group of us went to dinner on a friday night, but the place really wasn't that busy. We were seated right in front of the stage, so we got to see the line dancing and dance lessons up close. It was really neat to see, everyone was so enthusiastic about it.  The service was mediocre. Our waitress, actually I don't think she even gave her name, was pretty young. She didn't seem like she really wanted to be there, and never really made appearances. So, we had to flag down some other servers.   The food, also not the best. Everyone at the table ordered the fish fry, but I opted for the salmon salad. Kind of a mistake. The fish was burnt, very very burnt, and the salad was soggy from too much dressing. ick.  We would come back for the atmosphere, and maybe drinks and a try their burgers."}
{"text":"Having a great time watching Super Bowl LI Harolds style!! Great food and service and perfect outdoor seating to watch the game."}
{"text":"Has really gone downhill...not worth the calories... Wings were greasy not like the wings we drove here for."}
{"text":"Food wasn't great - our server was nice but had a million tables and the manager was the laziest person I have ever seen. We waited forever for someone to get our order and then forever to get our food."}
{"text":"First of all, best Happy Hour in AZ. Amazing food, great drink deals. Lots of fun, great people live music. Everyday they have amazing specials, like all you can eat spaghetti on Monday's, all you can eat ribs on Tuesday and so in. Great ribs. Btw their side salad is the best."}
{"text":"Typical bar food. Not that bad. Looks like the place hasnt been updated in decades. Pool table only reason i stuck around. I feel there are newer and nicer places for the same cost.  Didnt see a reason to go back."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, crappy service. What is with employees in carefree/cave creek??? We would go back for the food as football season is here."}
{"text":"We come here a lot because we love the food. The service is okay, it depends on who you get....sometimes it's hard to find your waitress and other times your waitress is awesome. But, we love the atmosphere and the food and are now regular customers. It's hard to be in Cave Creek and not come here."}
{"text":"Our first and last visit.    The Good: The atmosphere is cute but we love everything in Cave Creek. The carrot cake was good.  Unfortunately, this is  where it ends. The bad:  Customer service: AWFUL!    -Food- AWFUL!!!!  Their menu is huge so right off the bat I knew they probably didn't do anything spectacular but everything mediocre.  I hesitantly went with the Filet Mignon.  I had a baked potato and salad.  The baked potatoes was the best thing I had to eat, outside the carrot cake.  I asked for my steak medium well.  When it came out it looked like a piece of coal and when I cut into it it was very well done.  It was so dry I could not eat it, and I tried.  My husband got the T-Bone and he likes his rare to medium.  It had no pink inside what so ever.  However, he was able to eat his because he said it had a lot of things on top and some butter.  Our friends had the ribs.  I tried them and they were okay, at best.  Now I must say I compare all ribs to those at Houston's (Hillstone).  They have the absolute best ribs I have ever had.  So, I don't order ribs anywhere else.  I did try theirs just to see and they were not even close to Houston's.  If you have never had the best then the average Joe would probably say these were good.  To me they were very average.   more problems:  I got the salad before my meal and asked for extra egg....seriously extra egg.  She came out with one egg.  I asked for another side of egg and I had to remind her twice.  She then came out with two more eggs.  When we got the bill we saw that we were charged 2.25 for 2 eggs.  Seriously?!  I have never been charged for a side of egg before.  I am actually more upset about the fact I was not told prior and given the choice.  If there is a charge for something the waitress needs to inform their customers before hand.   The thing that bothered us the most was the fact when I complained about my steak she said she would send the manager over.  However, she sent this 16 year old hostess (seriously, she was the one who sat us).  She came out and said \"oh I can take a little off your bill for that\".  She did not offer to remake my steak or get me anything else.  She said can I get you some drinks .....I had tea.  I do not drink.  So, since I could tell she was not going to take off my meal or remake it I felt I did need to get something so I asked her to give us a dessert.  So, I got a free dessert and they took off $9.80 from my $25 burnt steak.  I could not believe it.  I have NEVER had a restaurant not either take off the meal or offer to remake it.  We will never go back there.    -Service- SUPER slow and forgetful!  I think we were there for 2 hours.  I had to remind our waitress a couple times on a couple different occasions to bring something.    I would not recommend Harold's"}
{"text":"Similar to how one might spend his entire summer building a resistance to Iocane powder, I've spent the last few years building my resistance to tequila and Dos Equis, Well I'm happy to report how all of my resistance training paid-off yesterday at Harold's.  The ultimate challenge.  Cinco de Stinko and, The Kentucky Derby all rolled into one day-drinking event.  Five stars for our server, who could 'make or break' such an event. She was young, pleasant and attentive, making sure we had fresh soldiers upon her noticing our half-empty bottles. Now that's attentive.   We dedicated the first half of the day to Kentucky, drinking only Maker's Mark, washing it down with beer, and cursing the Duke NCAA basketball coach for losing in the first round of this year's March Madness tournament. Fucker.   Anyway, the place was packed. Lots of forty something babes with bonnets and old dudes in tow. But after a couple of Mint Juleps, the old-dudes were going down like Sasha Gray. Then it got fun, watching as the bonnet brigade checked us outt....their 'dates' slumped in their chairs.  The betting lines were long, but that worked in our favor. By astutely spying the end of the line for a group of fun-loving babes, whose old-dude escort was too weak to mess us up, we picked that moment get into the very long line.  Before long, we were buying shots for the girls. Laughing till we snorted. Trying on their bonnets, and encouraging them to dance. Fun for a while, but now it was time to turn our attention to Cinco. The race run.  This is where all the training paid off.  Drinking only tequila and Dos Equis, smack-talking the white babes in Spanish,  and now, trying to hustle weed from the old hippie bikers, we managed to meet some really fun people. Some who even thought they were the shit, challenging us to a drinking duel. Dumbasses.  Nobody beats me in day-drinking.   I majored in Iocaine powder...remember? Anyhow, we prevailed. It was fun to see them go down in flames. Even more fun to see one of them throwing up over the patio rail.  But I got some nice pics on my Iphone and before too long, decided to call it a day.  I don't recall much after that. Only waking up in the parking lot in my Jeep, delighted to see how I had all my limbs, digits, and no sign of blood anywhere on my person.   Overall, it was a good day.  Thanks Harold's.  I don't know who helped me to the Jeep and tucked me in, but if it was one of your staff, special thanks to them."}
{"text":"I like to be positive, so I will start with the good. This is a great place to go and have drinks in the quaint western town of cave creek. The building is a nice representation of the towns old west/country feel. I have been here dozens of times and live just a couple miles away. I would highly recommend Harold's for a drink with some buddies.     With that said, I went yesterday for brunch and ordered the corn beef hash and eggs over medium. The food was not even as good as I could make at home. The hash tasted like it was out of a can and the eggs were over cooked. The bloody Mary was bland and tasted like the mix was ready to turn. You get that bitter carbonated taste.   Lastly, I would highly advise management that the cleanliness of this bar was lacking. There was trash and half eaten food from the night before still sitting on the picnic benches. Be aware that Harolds has turned more dive bar than fun western themed restaurant. Don't go out of you way unless you have already eaten and your there to see the music and drink only."}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue. The meat has a smoky flavor. Nice country atmosphere"}
{"text":"Downtown Cave Creek's popular restaurant and watering hole.  Extensive menu and hardly ever a wait for a table because of its large size.  Service is consistently slow, but the vibe and ambiance takes tour mind off of the wait.  A must for out-of-town visitors.  Dinner here than a short walk across the parking lot for live bull-riding at Buffalo Chip Saloon on Wed and Fri nights."}
{"text":"The burgers were good but the child's meal come on Kraft mac and cheese 6.99 rediculas. The service was terrible and it wasn't even crowded on a Tuesday evening we ordered our meal to never see our server again and then they have the audacity to charge a prop 206 tax. REAL JOKE!  Try earning the tip next time"}
{"text":"Been here twice now, once for lunch and once for dinner. Lunch was good, dinner not so much. The baked ziti at lunch is home cooking comfort food. Basic yet good. Dinner however was confused, I feel like the menu is way too big to really make anything well. Food was all under seasoned, and thrown on the plate. Waitress was stretched too thin because it a was so busy and so incredibly loud. The tables are not set up well and makes it hard for both patrons and staff to get around. I would go again for a quick lunch, but with so many choices in the area I would go elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"Inexpensive happy hour menu. Spacious interior and covered patio. Busy on the weekends, parking area can be crowded."}
{"text":"Harold's is pretty good! Stopped in for a few beers at the bar area. They've got an impressive happy hour(s) list of specials, which starts earlier than most other bars. $1 off premium drafts (good beer), which knocks em down to $3 a pint. Select appetizers for a mere buck & all others at 50% off. That's what I call a happy hour specials list! Not a bad spot to kick back and enjoy some beers & apps."}
{"text":"Eh...the food is ok.  Nothing to write home about and I've had better elsewhere. There really isn't anything compelling about Harold's that would make me want to go back again."}
{"text":"The food is terrific but, most importantly, this is the biggest, greatest Pittsburgh Steelers bar in the country.    A biker bar located in the desert twenty minutes north of Scottsdale, they have live music as well.    Cave Creek, and Harold's especially, is definitely worth the short road-trip (twenty minutes tops) when visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. We live in cave creek and are loyal to saying local with eating etc.... this is the fourth time we been to this place and had a horrible experience. The other three times we were there the service was horrible. Like non existent- we sat there over 25 min before anyone even came to help us with a menu or whatever then never returned.  We had to order our food at the back bar and refill our own drinks. When we did get them my husband found broken glass in his drink. Today, we showed up to eat a quick breakfast and went there because all of the football games were on. They tried to seat us back in that tiny room with no TVs- there were seats in the upper bar open and we explained we just wanted to eat and watch the multiple games. No intentions at all to stay all day and booze up- just breakfast and out. Like a 35-40 min ordeal. They said we couldn't sit anywhere else because they were setting up for the stealers game.  That starts at 1:00 and it's 10:45? Poor way to operate- sounds just lazy to me.  It was just my husband and I, not a group of 15. The girl at the stand had no common sense.  Not worth it !! Out of towners don't stop.  Not worth it.  They cant even treat locals. Decent."}
{"text":"OK food, OK drinks, OK service. Just OK. It could use a little sprucing up, and the menus need to be wiped down or tossed out for new ones, but it is OK. Food is just OK. Lots of fried options."}
{"text":"It's a lively Saturday night in the cowboy town of Cave Creek. Just four \"city folk\" out for a night of two steppin, beer drinkin', cowboy hat wearin' good times. The first stop on the list was Harold's, a classic in the Cave Creek community and the setting to many a movie over the years. We stepped through the doors to step back into a time of saloon living and let the night begin.   Harold's is a classic and rightfully so. The food is good (especially the Southwestern burger), the drinks flow and the setting is the perfect blend of families out for a western filled-fun night and adults looking to two step once they pound enough beers to give them liquid courage. Then there's the bands that come through. When we were there, we listened to a hip country cover band that played all the hits and kept the crowd swaying and singing to their favorite country songs. The people watching alone is worth making the drive for. I saw everything from classic cowboys gliding their cowgirls across the dance floor, to country-lovin' cougars ready to find their own John Wayne to call their own. And yes, they even have games here, including big buck hunter and car racing that kept me occupied for much longer than I like to admit. They also have pool and randomly enough, just one bags board (typically there are two).   Harold's is a great spot to start your night and have a cowboy's meal before hitting the prairie or night out on the town. I would prefer this spot for dinner and a drink or two and once it's time to untie your horse from this spot, just move next door for more of a hootenanny.  I see why this classic country establishment has been in business for so many years and why so many famous faces like to call it a favorite. It's on my list of favorite Cave Creek hangouts now as well!"}
{"text":"Public Service announcement: Cave Creek is large and not just the exit off the 101....   Agreed to come here on the former assumptiong and after looking this place up was worried I made a bad commitment. (Hey, I may be blonde but  I'm also new here!) Fun events going on here all the time! Busy even early on a Thursday. It is a ton of fun! I came here with a big group of family/friends. Although the Catfish took a while longer than the rest of the meals to come out, the food was good, the music was loud, and the place was accomodating to all ages. (Not really sure the music was that great but I can't complain as you can still generlly speak to your neighbors). I would definately come back!"}
{"text":"Harold's is a must stop place in Cave Creek. It is one of those places that has a diverse crowd, but everyone gets along. Once inside, you will see bikers, Cowboys (real and posers) locals and tourists. They always a kick in' bands and the place can get rock in. Also, the owner is a huge Pittsburgh Steelers fan, so this is the place to watch their games."}
{"text":"Nice Staff. Always a good night at Harolds."}
{"text":"if you want to hangout with good people and feel safe and let loose then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Waiting for our prime rib specials.  Nice crowd, the game on tv, Josh taking good care of us.  Yee-ha, Harold's!"}
{"text":"I liked this place.  First time there and has a huge dive feel to it.  Big place that has lots of space to view the games at.  It's a steelers bar so watch what you say.  Got the fried chicken and it was delish.  Definitely not fine dining but good dive food"}
{"text":"Oh my.  The place is ratty.  Servers were very nice but disorganized.  I ordered a G&T, and it was the weakest pour I've ever seen.  A G&T is 4:1  They made it in a highball glass, started with a 1 oz. pour, then filled with tonic.  A six year old could have drank this.  Salad was out of a bag, not bad or horrible, but nothing special at all.  My ribeye was literally a wad of fat.  No quality control here at all."}
{"text":"Great service and a really good breakfast! Super cute country bar & restaurant. Love the decorations for Christmas and all the western decor! They teach line dancing twice a week. Definitely recommend checking out Harold's while in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"I love this place.   It could have something to do with the drink I partake in before and while I am here. ??  The service while slow is always good.   The fish fry is a favorite of mine. Done right and simple.   The patio is a great place to hang out and drink or eat! You can hear the live band anywhere in and out of the building."}
{"text":"Time at the location 1 pm Oct 3, 2009  All, just wanted to add a few comments about a this restaurant that i stop to eat. Its Steeler bar which is not problem -I am Eagles fan and there a few tv's around  The food was not that good I had the roast beef with lousy gravey more like a paste, my wife had the chicken sandwich which according to her was fair. The service is the worst I've have ever experienced. I would not recommend this place for anyone who like spend their hard earn money and not get good food adn service in return. The Hostess need to find another job was not friendly.  BTW this place doesn't care about your 2nd Amendment Rights. There is a sign post at the door.  Spend your $$$$ elsewhere"}
{"text":"I have been going to Harold's for years, but I went today and had the the best Shrimp Street Taco's I have ever had!  If you have not been to Harold's lately you need to go.  This place is absolutely amazing.  We are looking forward to the 4th of July celebration.  Check out their website at http://haroldscorral.com/ for the schedule.  Guaranteed to be a good time....."}
{"text":"Wife got sick on the fish tacos.  My burger was markedly sub-standard.  Waitress had a snarl.  Do you need to know more?"}
{"text":"Always a great time and it's not just bar food. Try the prime rib or the peppercorn pork chops, you won't be disappointed.   If you can, ask for Lynn's section. She'll make sure you have a great experience."}
{"text":"It's a shame my experience sucked, but to be honest we didn't come during any events at the restaurant, and we came in a large group. Also I didn't choose to eat here; we were here for a celebration.  No one sat us; we arranged tables ourselves outside. A waiter eventually came 10 minutes later to get our drink orders.  Prices for the food are too high, especially since the quality is bad. I had the BBQ burger, and there was a dot of barbecue sauce imprinted in the bun, none on the burger. The sauteed onions sat in a pool of grease on top of the burger. The sweet potato waffle fries ($2 extra) were soaked in oil, so bad that it took 2-3 napkins just to soak up some of the grease off of one piece. I ate the burger because I was very hungry, but it wasn't any good. My friend ordered chicken fingers, and for $8 she got 4 measly-looking pieces.   I don't know where all the good reviews are coming from. Maybe they have good bands play or good drinks that I don't know about; but the food is absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place for a burger and a beer.  I had the blue cheese and bacon burger.  It came with lots of fries on the side.  Not the best burger I've ever had, but completely satisfactory. In keeping with the \"blue\" theme I washed it down with a Blue Moon from the tap.  Try to catch some of the live music acts they have here at night."}
{"text":"Being a Stillers fan I have really wanted to like this place but after going a few times I'm getting tired of being treated like crap and eating bad food.  The service is horrible, the manager I spoke with was very rude, and very WT if I might add but that is ok, can't hold that against her.  Asked to speak with the owner, was told he was busy, said I would wait to describe the situation and he never came out, or was probably never told.    They have no clue how many people I dragged with me to this place solely to watch Steelers football and I will never be bringing my and their money back.  I have since found a new Steelers bar, American Junkie in Scottsdale, a little bit of a drive for me but much better food and service so I don't mind at all.    Go Steelers!"}
{"text":"I have only been here once for a bachelor / bachelorette auction and let me tell you I felt so bad for some of those people, especially the one bachelor that didn't get any offers. Ouch. The food was decent and the people were nice, although I am sure they were kinda wondering what the blazes I as doing there lol. I was even asked if I was going to be on the auction block that night. Hmm I wonder how much if any I would have raised for charity. Ah the world will never know."}
{"text":"Having a GREAT time at Harold's Corral 3rd of July party- unfortunately, they advertised FREE shaved ice which was actually $4.50, Free game truck which was actually $4-$10 and free face painting- the line was way too long to find out how free that was. Cash only which would have been nice to know in advance and $20 to park. God Bless America and Capitalism."}
{"text":"Harold's is worth the drive up north if you're looking for a good 'ol country / biker bar to drink beer, listen to country music, and/or watch Steelers games... It's a huge space with several rooms inside and a great big outdoor patio too.  Up until my most recent visit, I might have told you that the service and food were pretty consistent too... but unfortunately, both the service and food sucked during our last visit!  Since I've been going to Harold's for years though, I'm sticking to a 3 star review in hopes that our last experience was a fluke. In the past, I've enjoyed both the beef ribs and the salmon entrees at Harold's.  I went for a steak salad last visit and was extremely disappointed - it was pretty nasty. I also found it funny that when my bf asked about the soup of the day, the waitress said it was 'clam chowder' and that it was 'good when fresh' but she didn't recommend it the day we were there... huh, that kinda makes you wonder?!  Harold's does offer steamed broccoli as well as plenty of other side items including french fries, coleslaw, baked potato, and more.  Their menu is huge with something for everyone, but I think Nadia C has the right idea in going to Harold's for beer and burgers!"}
{"text":"This place is happening . I ate here last night they have awesome food . Live bands and cold beer. The bar staff is great. This place feels like home. They have plenty of parking and outside bar. Who could ask for more."}
{"text":"Love hanging out at Harold's! Great food and Super Bowl atmosphere!! walked in without reser but hostess was able to find us an awesome table by the bar and countless big screens. Shot specials with every score and quarter. Ordered a couple beers, tequila shots and nachos!! Go Falcons!!"}
{"text":"If you want mediocre food served with an attitude, this is the place for you. Can't think of any reason to ever go back.   Checked the website before going for happy hour on Saturday. Website shows happy hour is every day. Asked about it after being seated and given menus and was told \"it's high season and we don't update the website \". Would have walked out if we weren't there with another couple.  Might have been okay if the food had been good, but it wasn't. The server's attitude was the topper."}
{"text":"Server was courteous and attentive. The open face turkey sandwhich came missing the mashed potatoes and was really salty.  The cheeseburger was ordered medium and was almost raw.    The flavour of the hamburger was good and probably would have been a good burger if it had been cooked a bit more.  They probably would have fixed the burger but sometimes it just feels like to much if you complain about everything you've ordered."}
{"text":"I love this place and great to watch football, we had the wings and always great for breakfast"}
{"text":"We came in for Simple saturday morning breakfast and ended having the best time!! Our waitresses, Kristin and Amanda were awesome! They kept our mimosas full while very entertained! Food is great! Service is fabulous!! I definitely recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Okay this is the first and last time I will eat at this shit whole. The wife and I went there thinking it was going to be a good place to eat. The only good thing there was the coffee. I had the chicken fried steak thinking that it is impossible to screw something that simple up was I wrong. When I get it it looked good but oh yes a but when I bit into it it was like they used Italian seasoning for the breading WTF. The steak was so tough that I nor my wife could chew through it I think they took a boot off the wall and served it to me. She has complaints as we'll but She will do her on review. The service was pathetic the waitress was so slow about getting what we asked for that we quit asking 10 mins for a cup of coffee. The money is at the bar not the tables everybody at the bar was served quickly never had to wait. Later that day I was burping up that crazy ass Italian taste from the fried steak which I ended up throwing up over. I really think I got something close to food poisoning that was the only thing that I ate the rest of the day started sweating feeling hot and finally yup threw up. Like I said I will never eat there again if it has the name Harold on it you can count me out ugh. What a dump my food scraps would have been better than this."}
{"text":"Decent steaks. Great burgers. Solid western party on weekend nights."}
{"text":"Great First Time Experience!!!! Angela did Amazing especially for such a large group party. :)"}
{"text":"Went into this place for the first time on Friday night.  So glad I did.  Amazing service from Angela D.  She suggested I try the fish fry. It was awesome.  Definitely ask for Angela though if you go in.   My drink was always full.  She has a great personality and made lots of recommendations for next time.  We also enjoyed the band.   Can't wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"Hahaha...I love Harolds because... 1) They treat me like family 2) They treat my friends like family 3) They catch my dog and treat her better than my family 4) They put up with my horses where ever they are parked 5) They enjoy when I bring them glassware that shows up at my house 6) Southwest Chicken Pasta rocks 7) Making the most from Reverse Happy Hour...  8) Drinking Shawn's Special Dirty Martini with six straws is not recomended... 9) I always appreciate the friendly handshake from Danny & Bill and the staff 10) Harolds Secret Pecan Pie needs to be on the menu..."}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch is good but not great, the place is a great steelers baron Sunday's"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and yummy food. Great place for a large party! The staff is really friendly and it's right in the middle of cave creek. Fun for events"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. The Mussels were fantastic. I was shocked. My Margarita was delicious. Service was pleasant. It was a rainy day. The table next to us informed the server the ceiling was leaking and the server replied, \"Yep, we are waiting for it to cave in.\" If you go on a rainy day make sure you are far away from the leaks. We will........"}
{"text":"As a resident of Cave Creek, Harolds has a long history and great food. But because the voters decided to pass Senate Bill 206 to have workers make a decent wage, harold's charges you a SB206 tax. I told the waitress why doesn't he raise the prices of the food, she replied he did. So that means you and I are all paid twice. These poor people only make 10 bucks an hour which is not even enough. I will not go back"}
{"text":"Harold's is a fun country bar way out in Cave Creek.  It's very far from my house, but when we're in Cave Creek playing golf or shopping, we drop in for a Beer or three.  It's pretty large and is a great place for a group to meetup after a golf tournament or hike.  We've never eaten here, just dropped in to imbibe.  The servers here are cute and friendly.  You'll frequently see a lot of bikers here, especially on the weekends.  We like to bring friends here to give them a feel for Arizona country drinking.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Ive been going to Harold's for years but just signed up for Yelp. I felt I needed to give it a review.... This place is perfect for everything from a Sunday brunch after church, to a night out to dinner with the kids, to watching the game with the hubby. We've never had a bad experience. Love the steaks, burgers and salads. oh and the beer is always ice cold! The girl at the bar even stuffed a couple extra on ice for us!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for ribs and chicken and your favorite beer! On Sunday morning they have a breakfast buffet. During football season go here if you are a Steelers fan! Lots of Motorcycle parking if you are on your bike. Service is a little mediocre though, but it's  Cavecreek..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to watch the Steelers games! Breakfast buffet is yummy, steaks are on point, and Bloody Marys are great. Go Steelers!"}
{"text":"We went down to Harold's for the Rodney Atkins concert on Saturday night and had an awesome time! They had all the big radio and beer vendors out there in the concert area, and the restaurant and bar area were jam packed but we didn't have to wait very long for food or drinks. There were probably a couple thousand people there for the concert, but they managed the crowd well in comparison to some big busy bars i've been in. We were able to meet the owner and his family, and they were more than gracious to us, very kind people and fun to talk to while we were enjoying the concert and afterward. I would definitely be there more often, but I live in Tempe, and thats a bit of a hike for me!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp tacos and they were pretty good.    My friend ordered a Purple Haze brew infused with raspberries and it was amazing!  I enjoyed a fresh iced tea and the amazing scenery off the patio.  You can't beat the location and desert landscape.  However, I thought the service kind of blew-- it was slow but felt rushed when she stopped at our table.  Maybe they had too many tables per server.  Prices were pretty high but we both did like our selections.   I'm not a beef eater, so maybe if I was ordering their specialties, I would  have hit a winner.  It's a checkerboard table kind of place with a touristy vibe and price tag."}
{"text":"If you're a Steelers fan (we are) , this place is a must.  One of my favorite places on the planet.   Especially on a fall Sunday.   Trust me on this one.    An 80 year old place out in the middle of nowhere.  God help me, I love all of it.    Wished they still had Iron City Beer!   somebody has to figure that one out.    Either way, we'll be back.  Probably every Sunday.  It's cheaper and more fun than NFL Sunday ticket :)"}
{"text":"Harold's is a redneck country bar. If you're a Democrat, enter at your own risk! My wife and I went there for a beer and quick bite tonight and found ourselves between a couple bigshot know-it-alls who were more than happy to use very foul language to disparage anybody who isn't a Republican. While talking about a boating experience he was upset about a sailboat that was unable to get out of his way because there was no wind. He yelled out \"ask them if they're Democrat or Republican! If you here anything but Republican, smash their ass!\" This was a relatively mild exchange and he went on to drop a series of F-bombs to talk about Obama and any non-Republican. I decided not to join in the discussion but rather get up and leave. I've seen too many guys like this who are more than happy to keep escalating their vile language. Harold's had become a regular hangout for us, but I think I've about had it with the ignoramus rednecks that feel the need to blast out their hatred and language in front of anybody in ear shot."}
{"text":"Harold's is a gem. I'm from Buffalo, NY an I can say these are honestly the best wings I've ever had........ outside of Buffalo ;)  Order them Black and Tan!"}
{"text":"My husband, friends, kids and I have visited Harold's frequently over the last couple of years and have always had a great experience.  The restaurant is kid friendly, has great prices and the staff and owners are amazing.    This review is specifically about their Southwestern Chicken Sandwich.  My husband and I went a couple of weeks ago and it seriously was the best sandwich I have ever had.  If you have not been please go to this amazing local establishment.  If you have been and have not had this sandwich you have to do so soon."}
{"text":"Good place for music on the weekends. It's a big space so plenty of room to move around. Dining is better earlier as the bar crowd and music get going later on.   As food, they have a wide selection and everything I've tried is \"ok\". For example, the chicken wings are fried, but then they drop sauce on top of them afterwards. I think the wings would be better simply fried sometimes. The calamari is good but you have to request marinara for the best flavor. The stakes are just ok, as are all of the sandwiches. If you need to please a lot of different tastes, then Harold's can fill most of them.   As for entertainment, check the calendar for a good band. It is almost always a country band, but they often throw in some rock music as well. The dance floor is adequate but there is lots of standing room near the bar for people who want to have a drink and socialize. Cave Creek is a small town, so you can walk across the parking lot to another bar and watch live bull riding for a while (yes, the real thing. Nothing mechanical for you out-of-towners), then come back to Harold's for dancing. It's not uncommon to see people making trips between two or three of the bars within walking distance.  I always recommend Harold's in the surrounding bars when I have visitors in town!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends while we were in the area for a girl's trip. We went on a Friday night and there was a live band that was awesome! The drink prices were reasonable (even for a Saturday night!) and we had more fun than I can even explain in a post! It was a corral feeling, which fits the area perfectly. There was a lively crowd there that just added to the enjoyable experience. I will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"Vacationing in Arizona has become a preoccupation for me because I want to move to the west coast. I explore food web-site to find cheap eats, food market and fine dining. I found Harols's Carrol while driving around.  The grandma meatballs were surprising delicious. I also had the grilled chicken Monterey. The place is just the way the old west us to be. If your ever in Cave Creek check out this place."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!! Will never, ever go back! Bartender and waitress are bullies!! Horrible experience with my service dog! Need I say more, just go to their Facebook page and read the reviews!!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place has such good food. I had the very best philly cheese steak sandwich (original) for lunch. My bf had the burger. We were both very happy with our meal choices. Seriously....so good. The service was not very fast here but the food made up for it. The fact that this is a Steeler \"bar\" during football season is annoying along with the country music. LOL. Both are to be expected. We had a great time & will be back soon. Cave Creek is such a fun place to get away to."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great food and great atmosphere! They throw the best 4th of July fireworks and party I have ever been to. I come out all the way from Connecticut to visit this place!"}
{"text":"Harold's is a cool country/biker bar  and worth checking out. The owner is such a sweetheart and the bartenders are all pretty cordial. I've only been a few times and have yet to try the food, but have enjoyed each visit I've made purely for the entertainment, country music and company. It's a pretty big sized bar/restaurant with a large wrap around patio.  If you're up for some two-step and rocking it out to a Lynard Skynard song or two, this is your spot."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Harold's. The food is good, not great but the atmosphere is fantastic and what gives this place 5 stars. They frequently have line dancing or bands.  My wife and I have been to both and the energy is tough to match.  Not to mention, unless it's a larger named band, they do not charge cover.  Harold's is almost always busy but no matter how busy the service has always been very good.  If you want a real country western bar, cold beer and a good time; check out Harold's. My main bit of advice and warning, don't drink and drive in cave creek. Police are everywhere."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast here while vacationing in Scottsdale. What made it even better was our fantastic waitress Taylor! We had 4 small tired children and 4 tired adults and she made sure we were completely taken care of! She was so great with the kids, very prompt with our orders and all around wonderful! It isn't often that we are that impressed! Thank you again!"}
{"text":"What a fun place.  Love the live music, food is great, and service is good.  Great old Cave Creek establishment."}
{"text":"Decent menu, nice ambiance, (very western cowboy), a Pittsburgh Steeler's hub, (but I overlook that)...   Dog friendly patio/porch which we really enjoy.  Most times we have a good meal here, but this last visit our waitress was slower than slow.  And not real attentive. We were one of the 2-3 tables on the patio that had people on them.  We waited and waited for our server but... nothing.  then two other tables were seated and the server finally showed up.  She waited on those two other tables first despite our sitting there for 20 min or so...  She seemed really slow on the drink orders or for that matter even asking us if we'd like another drink.  We had to ask for all of them., find our own ketchup, etc etc etc...  The other tables seated after us even got their meals and bills before we did.  And half of my meal was cold.  I would have o.k.'d getting the fries reheated or even a new order, but we had already been there almost 2 hours and wanted to just get the heck out of there.  \"IF\" they had they been swamped with customers I could have understood somewhat...  But they were not.  the meal it's self was \"o.k.\" my sweet potato fries were cold, even though they were served in a nice warm bowl.  Even the ones at the bottom of the pile were cold.  My usual Tri-Tip sandwich was a bit dry this time, seemed a bit over cooked.  But like I said, normally our meal there is pretty good.  Must have been a bad day.   At least I got to play with some nice doggies at the other tables, in between waiting for a server, food, or drinks..."}
{"text":"Bringing kids was a mistake. Never even bothered to order food after waiting for 20 minutes. Paid for my beer and we were out. Place is fine if you feel like getting hammered at 4pm."}
{"text":"I appreciate the communication with the  owner that resulted in my review. I always feel that service is the most important thing in a restaurant business, even if the food isn't top notch, good service will keep people coming back.   Again, I think this place had charm and we were both fans of the ambiance."}
{"text":"Plenty of beers on tap and served COLD!   The steak dinner was also very good.   I was there on a Monday night and the parking lot was already busy by 5PM.  Sitting at the bar, it's apparent that the local choose Harold's Corral for their local watering hole.    A happy meeting place in a great little town."}
{"text":"So last time I did a review here management contacted me and said they were going to send me a complimentary meal for 2 which I never recieved so I never went back until today. We went in with a party of 10 and given its game day and we didn't have reservations they got is a table. The table was outside so we asked for a heater and they brought us one but when they couldn't get it started they didn't do anything else about it. They brought us plates for the buffet but after we got our food we had to ask another server to ask our server if we could order drinks. He came back and took our drink order but we were all done eating by the time we got out drinks. The food in the buffet was mediocre I think because they are just trying to get it out for the crowds coming in but even the french toast wasn't even cooked all the way. My friend recieved his check and for 2 people was charged for 4. The manager is currently trying to make it right but I can guarantee now I will never be back here especially when there are so many other places across the street and down the street that have good service and food. So final verdict from the manager was discounting it 1 buffet per ticket and a shot of fireball."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my dad. Place doesnt open until 8am.  I ordered the chicken fried steak with biscuits and gravy and some OJ and it came with some potatoes. I dont remember what my dad got but  both our plates tasted like a jar of oregano. It was like they spilled it all over our dishes and instead of remaking more, they said fuck it and gave it to us.  I think it actually would have been good if it wasnt for the oregano all over."}
{"text":"Harold's is a great place to hang out with your buddies and enjoy a few reasonably priced drinks. It's a large bar, but has a very local, small town feel to it."}
{"text":"Where to begin...  Four weeks ago I called Harold's to ask what time my family should arrive on Sunday before the Steelers game to get a good table, and I was told to show up about an hour before. So my family and I showed up and hour before, and the hostess said we needed to have an reservation and pay $10 dollars a person. Shouldn't I have been told that a week before when I called and asked?   So we went to pay for our spots and they even charged us for my 4 month old baby, ridiculous right? I understand that you need to pay for every seat you take, but my baby was in her stroller at the end of the table so she didn't even take a seat.   Our server was very friendly and even funny. He told us he didn't work at Harold's but was there to help.   I ordered a cheese burger medium rare, and received it well done. Nothing special about the burger.   Not that we knew to make a reservation, we reserved a spot for the next week without a problem. That next Sunday was a lot of fun. It was like being with a huge family. The service was okay, and like mentioned before the food was nothing special. By the end of the night we reserved our table for the Steelers vs the patriots game. We asked for the same table we had that night and the hostess said, \"no problem\" and wrote the table number next to our names.  Now to the last time we will ever be at this place. We show up for the patriots game (6 people in our group) and they took us to a different table than the one we reserved. PLUS they had our group split up sitting at two different tables. We spoke to the hostess about the problem and asked why we weren't at the table we reserved and why were we split up, and with attitude she told us, \" just because you request a specific table doesn't mean you'll get it\". That's understandable, however that should have been told to us when we reserved the table so we would have known there was a chance we weren't going to get it.   The server was, well, awful. When he came to my table I asked if they had menues I could look at, and  he called me \"salty\" loud enough for me to hear. Seriously not a good way to talk to customers. I mean calling me names right off the bat?   I ordered the fried zucchini, potato skins, and a side of mashed potatoes. I receiver the mashed potatoes, which were dry, and the potato skins. I figured the zucchini would be out shorty but it had been a while so I asked our server if it was coming out. He told me I never ordered the zucchini but he would ring it in for me. A while later two zucchinis came out and the server said, \"oh I guess you did order the zucchini the first time. I guess you get a free zucchini\" Not too sure if we really got a free zucchini because I didn't get the chance to look at the bill before it was paid. By the end of the game I asked for a beer and he never brought it to me. My fiancé had to remind him I ordered a beer. I've been a server/bartender since I was 17 and this service was unacceptable.  During this game it was announced that there were having a photo contest all you had to do was take a photo during the game and then post it to their Facebook page. My group and I took a picture and tried to post it, however on the Harold's FB page you could not post anything to it. So I went to the hostess stand to ask how to enter our photo. I had to talk to three different people. Two hostesses then some gentleman who didn't even know. He was rude to me, explaining that all I had to do was upload it to their page, because it was a photo contest. Like I didn't know that already? I had to further explain that that wasn't possible. He then told me to post the picture on my own page then tag them in it.   I never found out who won the photo contest, so I messaged Harold's asking when they were going to announce the winner, and of course, got no reply.  I only liked this place because of the atmosphere. The service was absolutely awful. The food wasn't good either. We won't be back here ever."}
{"text":"I am sorry to have to write such a poor review for Harold's.  We live locally and try to support the locally owned business as much as possible.  Harold's has always been a fun spot for us in the past.  We attempted to go for happy hour last week. The front bar was closed and the back bar was pretty full.  There was only one bartender to make drinks for the entire restaurant and she was pretty slow moving as it was.  Worst of all the owner was there just hanging out drinking and never got behind the bar to help out.  After waiting 20 minutes without being served while sitting at the bar we left.  Until they up their staffing we won't be back."}
{"text":"Don't let the fact that this is a Steelers bar dissuade you.  It's actually a great place.I've eaten here several times and particularly love the open face roast beef. Tender, great gravy and super fluffy mashed potatoes.    The bar/restaurant has various bar sections, including a huge patio, off track betting (if you're into that) and live music.   It's a great cowboy/biker bar with surprisingly good food."}
{"text":"Our plan was to go elsewhere but ended up at Harold's after dropping off our truck for a detail at a business up the road. We have been here a few years back for breakfast and unfortunately back then it was nothing special so we did not return. Always willing to give what we considered a mediocre restaurant another chance we decided on Harold's. We were seated and and served water and drinks quickly. Thumbs up. We arrived at 11:50 with breakfast ending at noon and figured it was too late to order breakfast at 11:55 but..... nope. Our waitress Jamie, with a big smile, said no problem and promptly retrieved breakfast menus. Wow. Impressive for the sole reason that their selections were varied with different combinations of flavors - nothing like what I recalled. I ordered the Ranch hand omelette and honey had the chicken enchilada breakfast burrito. Both came with ranch potatoes. Our breakfast arrived fairly quickly and again- impressive! Everything looked and tasted wonderfully. My husband made noises usually reserved only for my cooking- good noises! Both meals were chock full of the ingredients named in the menu description and I could individually taste the spinach, mushrooms, taco meat, etc. And the ranch potatoes... yeah let's talk about the ranch potatoes. They were some of the best- cooked brown with big pieces of green peppers and onions and nicely seasoned. Nice cooking there - like what I grew up on - almost as good as my dad's breakfast potatoes .  Compliments to our server Jamie who was awesome as we'll as the chefs- great job. After we left the first thing my honey said how much he enjoyed breakfast and how he couldn't wait to return and try something else."}
{"text":"My cousin and his 12 year old son were visiting from Chicago, so we thought they'd enjoy a cowboy restaurant. Unfortunately the service was very slow, the food awful, and when the band started playing we couldn't hear each other.  Why this place has been around so long is a mystery to me."}
{"text":"Great service. The hostess, Jenna, was so polite and shared information on menu. Waiter, Joshua, was awesome and attentive. Would come back again soon."}
{"text":"Harold's is a lot like most of the restaurants in Cave Creek. It has a lot of country flare, and a lot of steak and ribs on the menu. Some friends of mine who live in Cave Creek recommended we go there for lunch one day.   The food was decent, but the service was pretty bad. It was nice and quiet during the lunch hour though which was nice. My friends really seemed to like it out of most of the places in Cave Creek so if you are there check it out."}
{"text":"Love the cowboy nights. Line dancing, bbq and fish fry.   Dina was an excellent server. We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Don't go on Sunday football,  because they will ask you to leave. Tables are for Steeler ticket holders. And don't tell you while your sitting that you have a short time to have the buffet and then ask you to leave. Not even getting asked if we want another table. Embarrassing! !! We went for breakfast then thought we would catch some of the game, but our party was asked to leave as the table was reserved and wanted the table. We will never go back. Plus the breakfast on let was like rubber. Potatoes burnt along with the toast"}
{"text":"I have always received great service and the food is always great as well.  I have attended large group functions as well as hanging out by myself.  A perfect destination for bikers as well as the huge Steeler fan base!  Great people and a great place.  Greeted always at the door mostly by Amanda who checks on us whenever she walks by.  Other staffers are always helping out each other.  Great place."}
{"text":"In from Cincinnati late...one of the only places still serving food....the burgers are wonderful and the bartender Andrew was great...meet some great local people even one was nice enough to give me a ride home...even though it is a Steelers bar it is a must see"}
{"text":"Worst meal I've had in memory. BBQ pork ribs were dry, overcooked and cold.  Sirloin steak was worse.  Tough as a boot, overcooked and cold....not room temperature, but COLD.  We mentioned the poor food to the server and it was like \"gee, too bad\".   To top matters off, then came the MANDATORY 20% gratuity.  Talk about rubbing your nose in it."}
{"text":"The hostess AND the waitress had horrible attitudes. Lost our business tonight and a chance of me and my friends ever coming back. The 17 dollar plate of food from Buffalo Chip was worth it compared to anything that probably could have been served at Harold's. Assuming it's as bad as the attitudes their employees have. Do NOT waste your time here. There's much better places in the area."}
{"text":"The food is great the service, not so much. Though everything was very quick and efficient the servers seemed put out by tourists, which seems to contradict there market.  Drink specials are really great, as are the appetizer specials. We ordered the wings which were standard buffalo wings but cooked extra crispy and were really good.  We ordered the bone in ribeye which was advertised as there best steak. We ordered it medium and Pittsburgh style. Served not much Pittsburgh style and medium well! However, I will surmise that we did not send it back and it was amazing! We really enjoyed it. Also the sautéed mushrooms and onions were a great addition.   As to the service everything was timely and efficient yet not very friendly and seemed put out by the tourists from Kentucky. Very unfortunate because otherwise, even with the deficiency in the steak likely would have warranted 4 to 5 stars!  This is highly recommended by the locals and did not disappoint. The patio is great for sunsets as well!!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely off of our list of stops for our rides. Last time the buffet was terrible. This time we ordered off the menu and the food for all 8 of us was either wrong, cold, or burned to a crisp. Completely disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm a bit partial to good ol' Harold's. I have gone multiple times over the years as a teen, college student, and now, post-grad. I've always had a great time at this place and the food is just the beginning.  Harold's has events for every night of the week from karaoke, to all-you-can eat, to live music and they manage to get a good crowd no matter which one is being featured (especially during a Steelers game). Be sure to check online which day sounds the best for you if you plan on doing more than dining.   The food is really good and the portion size is massive so bring an appetite. My most recent trip to Harold's was with the family for breakfast. Home fries, biscuits, blintzes, even the egg white omelets are great. Huge menu so explore the options.   SUMMARY: if you are in the Cave Creek area, I would highly recommend the experience Harold's has to offer if an old west saloon appeals to you in the slightest."}
{"text":"Wow, what a terrible experience.  First we had to wait to be seated even though there many empty tables.  It's an old trick that mostly bars use to make it seem that they are busier than they really are .. stupid.  We ended up sitting at the bar.  We waited for 45 minutes to get our food and when we got it, it was HORRIBLE.  We ordered two burgers and one pastrami sandwich.  The sandwich was sent back and the burgers were made with old hamburger and the buns were dry.  We choked them down as we were so hungry but both of us felt ill later in the day!    It was bike week and the town was filled with people and its no surprise that this hole was not busy.  NEVER AGAIN will I enter this place and I wouldn't be surprised if they shut the doors for good."}
{"text":"The seared salmon salad was absolutely perfect. Perfectly cooked and the dressing on the greens was so tasty. I would get this again and again. The sandwiches are huge and will try one of those next time I come by."}
{"text":"This is a great family place that is always busy! The food is just okay, but the entertainment they have on the weekends is a lot of fun. My family and I go at least once a week. The service is okay, sometimes its great, other times it could be better. The atmosphere is great and my family and I will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great experience, can't believe you can actually order all you can eat ribs. And not just any ribs, you can order beef or pork ribs. The beef ribs look like something the Flintstones would eat. The pork ribs are absolutely fabulous and it is all you can eat The beef ribs which of course is my favorite are the meatiest ribs I've ever had in my life if you go to the store and try to buy beef ribs they cut all the meat out luckily heralds cuts their own meat The ribs are great this service is great one of the ladies that was our server was also a part-time manager her name was Heather and Heather is absolutely amazing great personality cute as a button if I wasn't 30 years her senior I would have asked her out"}
{"text":"Great place to watch the Steelers play.  They do get so busy that service suffers but still a great venue if you love the Black & Gold!"}
{"text":"Sippin Chimay listening to a smokin Sweet Home Alabama cover... Where else can you do that???"}
{"text":"The Food is great and the drinks are perfect. I was the only black person but I really think I'm the only one who noticed."}
{"text":"A very large venue, with two bars and lots of floor space.  A spacious porch which wraps around half of the building.  A destination for all the faux bikers in the area, and their girlfriends all dressed up for one another.  Typical old bar interior with numerous photos on the walls, several TV's but not a sports bar overload of video. Good beer menu.  Touts its steaks but I only went to consume a few beers an check it out. Dirt parking lot, which is good in the hot summer days in AZ.  Nothing special, but an OK place to meet friends, drink beer, eat free popcorn, and get out of the heat."}
{"text":"If you want fancy food and waiters who part time as sommaliers (not that there is anything wrong with that) then Binkley's and Cartwright's are great options...if you want a no frills bar menu and normal beer list (Fat Tire on tap and occasionally Sierra Nevada) with an entertaining live band then Harold's is your stop.  Oh yeah, also if you ride a Harley, have rubber bands in your beard or simply support the Steelers then this is the place for you as well.  But that being said, I have heard rumors about this place bein a rough and tumble biker bar.  Maybe I show up on off nights (Friday and Saturdays), but patrons have always been friendly.  So pull up a chair, relax and bask in the Sonoran sunsets and night skys.  By the way, the 3 stars isn't a knock on this place, I honestly enjoy it.  But it's tough to give more than 3 stars to a standard bar.  And if they kept folks from smoking on the patio I would add one more star, but then where would the urban cowboys get their Marlboro man on?"}
{"text":"Will not come back. Good waitress and clean restrooms were the only positives. Slooooooow and we ordered one of the lunch specials of fish and chips I subbed onion rings for fries. Came with coleslaw that either had the worst dressing or had gone bad. Couldn't decide. The fish should have labeled \"breading with rumor of fish\"; same could be said of onion rings. Think it's mostly a bar and band place."}
{"text":"I love the bartenders and staff besides the wannabe \"macho security\" staff. My group was there for 2+ hours when a creepy guy comes up and won't leave a new found friend alone. My friend and I walk her to the circle k safely, come back a few minutes before 2 and we are told we're not allowed in. Great? Well I want to grab my wife that's still inside and they say no, call her. I get aggravated at that point because I don't want another beer, I want the safety for my wife. I get her to start coming out so we can leave and creepy guy is blocking her, making her hug him and holding on to her while she's trying to leave. Tell me why I get yelled at for getting up on the side of the porch telling this guy to let her go and this guy doesn't get reprimanded at all. Fuck that and fuck you guys- you've lost my business. Maybe hire less ego-fanatic assholes and I'll reconsider."}
{"text":"Living up in Carefree has it's perks. Away from the big city and freeway car exhaust, lots of desert washes and mountains to hike, and some pretty decent grub in the near Cave Creek area. I've found some hidden gems that serve great meals at lower than average for Cave Creek prices. Harold's does not compare to said places. I can count on one hand the number of times I've had the \"pleasure\" of dining here in the past two years. More than half were Friday night fish fry's which were only worth the cost as it is \"all you can eat as long as you don't mind waiting forever.\" The last time we tried eating here we decided to dine outside on the patio. After being seated we waited about fifteen minutes watching waitresses come out and serve other tables, refill drinks, and bring checks. No one came to our table once. I think we put the menus on the floor before leaving and driving somewhere else.  The host area in the front always has at least 3 or 4 queen bee wannabe's standing around looking like they just woke up, or chirping away about the latest gossip. They make you stand there with no greeting for at least a minute or two before giving you a less than pleasant glance and acting as if you are bothering them. After you are seated it takes another ten minutes before you get waters or an uninspired \"Hello.\" More time passes before your waiter/waitress asks what you want like it's a huge burden for them to list down on a piece of paper and give to the cooks.  The food is less than average, it makes you wonder if these people hate what they do for a living because most chefs I've known cook with passion because they like making dishes that will put a smile on your face.   I think the people that come here often either own a motorcycle and are just looking for another drink before they head to the next town and find something real to eat, or some unknowing poor soul from out of state that doesn't know what Yelp is to help them spend their money wisely."}
{"text":"As a resident Creeker, I can tell you that ONLY tourists and wannabes come here.  Everyone thinks it's some bad ass biker bar, and as far as legit biker bars go, this ain't it.   I always thought the inside looked like a VFW hall, so I honesty don't get the interest.  Besides the wannabe thing mentioned above.  lol  If you're ordering something like buffalo wings, and have low expectations, you'll be content with the food.  Beyond that, you don't come here for the food.  You come here because you are a wannabe.    But, it is Steelers central, and if that's your thing, you will have a good time among your brethren."}
{"text":"Update. I still have not gone back to Harold's and will not. I received an email from Dan Piacquadio claiming to be the owner of Harold's shortly after my review last year. He explained how sorry he was that a customer was upset, complained about how confusing the Deal Chicken offers were, along with explaining how Deal Chicken offers affect him. In this email he stated: \"Unfortunately for you we did not realize Deal Chickens mistake so I would also like to offer you a $20 gift card to come back and try us again. If you send me a mailing address I will be sure to put one in the mail . I would hope you would use the gift card to give us a fair review not one prdicated on the poor business model of Deal Chicken.\" I never heard from Harold's or Dan again. Really too bad becuase my husband loves David Allen Coe and he plays at Harold's regularly."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to watch Steelers games! If your a yinzer you must check it out..."}
{"text":"Yay!!! Ryann, we have missed seeing you behind the bar!! So glad to be here for a game and see you here with us! Starting this Sunday off right everyone is pumped you're here!   Love love LOVE this place! whether you want a delicious breakfast in the morning or a fun night out in the evening, this spot has got ya covered. The live music is always fantastic! Do yourself a favor and GO see Ryann at the bar for a drink. She is a blast and her drinks are always on point!"}
{"text":"LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL PRESENTATION!! Thanks Angelina!! Great food and great service!! Had such a great time."}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday and had an amazing time. The music and food was great and our waitress Gretchen did a phenomenal job serving us. She was attentive, sweet and accommodating. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Great ownership and always something to do every weekend of the year!!! #SteelersNation #SNUproud"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great costumer service and loved the live music! Next time I'm in AZ I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I came up here to Harold's for the first time in a long time, and I'm glad that I did.  I haven't been here in a while, and since the weather's been nice and I have some extra time, I thought I would treat myself to a nice lunch at Harold's.  I forgot how much fun this place is.  I pull up and there's 3 horses parked in the corral that customer's rode in themselves.  Loads of bikes in the parking lot, with quite a few people eating inside.  I went to the hostess station and told her it was just me, and she sat me in the Fireside dining area! I've never sat in this section before! It's a little room off to the side, with linen tablecloth's, a fire place and its much smaller and quieter to sit back here.  I ordered the BBQ sandwich which came with coleslaw, a pickle and had a Sprite as well.  Tasty!  I think my server was Brittany, and she did a marvelous job.  Service was great, food was awesome, and I love coming up here.  I will be back again in the future, as I had a great time and really enjoyed myself.  Keep up the good work Harolds! I love you guys!"}
{"text":"Not worth the trip.  Barely worth stopping if you are passing by and hungry.  Harold's Corral is a large vaguely western-themed eatery with a clean but cavernous main restaurant and patio seating made less enjoyable by the adjacent very dusty parking lot.    The food is standard western fare.  For lunch I had a burger and my wife had a beef BBQ sandwich.  They were okay - maybe the burger was a little better than average, but the less than crisp fries made up for it.    Prices are pretty high for a burger joint and this ain't no fine dining restaurant.  Three stars says it perfectly."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 30 girls for a  bachelorette party. We took a bus out, the girls  Unload and at least 12 go to the restroom. There was a lady who was already in the restaurant and went to stand in line and was pissed there we so many people in line. So she starts talking a little crazy and starts fighting with us in line. Keep in mind this isn't a 20 year old party. 90% of the party is in there mid 40's. Since a fight broke out we we're kicked out.  I was completely floored how unprofessional security was. The other party must be part of the little Cave Creek click. Needless to say we went to Buffalo chip and had a great time!! So if you are thinking of heading out there hit Buffalo chip instead."}
{"text":"The food and the atmosphere was amazing, as always. But I was quite disgusted with one thing. There was a female server, who wasn't ours (thankfully, because I would have left) who was a walking health code violation. Our server, Michael, was great! However, this other server, had ripped up holy shorts that barely covered her vagina, but \"beautifully\" showed off her awful thigh tattoos, and multicolored hair that looked like it hadn't been washed, let alone brushed in weeks. Sadly, that wasn't what disgusted me. What I found so disconcerting about her was that she kept her book (you know what she takes orders in and keeps her money etc.) tucked in the back of her shorts. Not in a back pocket, but actually in her shorts. I shouldn't have to explain why this is a violation and just plain gross... Even if she had appeared to have bathed recently, you just don't do that! Hopefully, by the next time we come back there will be better standards of appearance and cleanliness of staff. Some may need a refresher course of health code and food handling."}
{"text":"Harold's Corral is always fun to go to! We went for my brother's birthday and they had a live band playing that night! The atmosphere is great and the service wasn't too bad. I've had better barbecue at other establishments, but overall it was a fun experience!"}
{"text":"I would give them 5 stars if it were not for the bad service we waited over an hour for salad meals did not come at the same time one was 20 minutes after the rest of the party finished.  But the food is sooo damn good I have to come back."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour for a over cooked appetizer followed by over cooked entre. Not very good for dinner. Asked what their specialties were and were told the BBQ was great. NOT! Brisket was so overcooked, hard and rubbery. Worst I've had. Only decent things were the rolls and baked potato.  The spaghetti was overcooked too. We're looking for a neighborhood restaurant since moving to the area and this won't be it. Onward to other restaurants."}
{"text":"The service sucked, however I have to give 4 stars. My husband had the chicken enchiladas and I had the open faced turkey sandwich. We had wings as our appetizer. The wings were awesome. Our main dishes were good too. I just can't get ovet those tasty wings. ;-)"}
{"text":"Whether you are a local or just killing a couple of hours in the area Harold's is the best! Very relaxed and friendly place to kick back on the patio or at the bar for some food, drink and interesting conversation with some of the \"Creekers\". Live music on the weekends and fun events all year long!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a better rating...mostly because of the statue of Willie Nelson sitting on the bar smoking a J. Alas, Harold's, it was not to be.  I've been here a few times with a smaller crowd, but this past Saturday I brought family of 12 visiting from out of town on the way to a day at Bartlett Lake. Nearly everything that could go wrong did.   For starters, it turned out that they were having a Kentucky Derby viewing party that day. At the door, a startled hostess first told they couldn't accommodate a group my size with out a reservation, but they eventually found a place for us in the dining room.   Apparently, outside of their Derby party, everything else was an afterthought. Service wasn't unbearably slow, but we would've liked to see our waitress more often. We would have also liked her to listen more closely, because: I ordered fried chicken-I got chicken fried steak, 1 burger missing cheese, all burgers not cooked to doneness requested, several orders of sweet potato fries missing (even though we were still charged for the upgrade), several of us ordered the BBQ platter, only to be told 10 minutes later that it was too early in the day and they didn't have any cooked yet, we were charged 18% gratuity even on the items that were then removed from the bill (like the chicken fried steak).   The runner that brought my food out also rolled his eyes at me when I informed him that I had not ordered the chicken fried steak. Great service, dude.   Will I ever go here again? Maybe if it's just me and 1-2 friends and we're ordering steaks at the bar. More than likely, though, I'll be heading next door to the buffalo chip."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner because we wanted to try something different and take my Mom & Dad out for their birthdays while they were visiting us. NOT impressed. The one star is for the great service we got, but the food was not worth our time or the money they charged for it. Mom and I ordered Fried Shrimp, and I was weary of doing this because it was $18.99, seems pretty overpriced. Then I got it and I was not wrong- it lacked in flavor and had way too much breading on it. It came with a side of fries (For $18.99, really?) and they were probably the highlight of my dinner. My husband ordered brisket that looked more like beef jerky or a strip of leather . . . not worth the energy it took to eat it. My son ordered wings, he got BBQ style and the sauce was less than desirable.  Our waitress was super nice and attentive, otherwise I think I would have been very upset with this whole experience, especially when the tab came and was nearly $150 for 4 adults and 2 kids. Honestly, the best food was probably the cheeseburger that my daughter ordered off the kids menu.  I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Having been to Harold's for lunch before, I figured it would be a great place to come to again when in the area. I was wrong.  Oh so wrong.  We (my husband and I) were seated right away, which is great!  No wait!  However, we sat waiting for ANYONE to acknowledge us after that for at least 10 minutes.  Another couple was seated after us and was greeted before we were... By the same server.    We ordered drinks and our food at the same time in hopes to save time since we allotted about an hour for lunch, and our drinks came out within a few minutes.  And then we waited some more. Other servers, a guy that looked like a manager, food runners, OUR server (Kylie is her name) they all walked by numerous times. 40 minutes with no update about when the food might come, another table updated on their to-go order, and FINALLY our order came.  I asked for the bill right away in order to expedite things further (which was the smoothest process of the entire visit).  The food left a lot to be desired. My husbands \"BBQ burger\" had no BBQ sauce, was missing toppings, and was incredibly unevenly over cooked (an edge was pink-ish, the rest was well done and was ordered medium).  My BLT was fine, but the bacon wasn't consistently cooked and my fries were room temperature.  We would have sent it back, but we might still be there 5 hours later.  I won't be back anytime soon.  Even locals know not to come here unless there's an event because apparently that's the only time servers know they'll make money.  Sad."}
{"text":"Love this place, absolutely fun and energizing!!!! Will continue to come to GameDay every week, every season."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for a football game last weekend.  Since it was a big game, seats had to be reserved in advance.  Upon arrival, there appeared to be confusion from the staff around how many spots we had reserved - not a great start to the afternoon, but it ultimately got fixed about 15 minutes later.     We shared the pizza breadstick and the loaded nachos - nothing special from a bar food standpoint.   Each of us had a few drinks over the course of a couple hours and the server was very attentive.  Aside from the final score of the game, I think we all had a pretty good time.    Some pluses, some minuses based on our experience.  Would return again for a couple drinks but would probably pass on the food."}
{"text":"When visiting AZ I totally love watching a Steelers game at Harold's Corral. What an exciting time I have year after year!! Amanda Lewis's enthusiasm accommodating me, as well as, other customers has made my visits extra special - Natalie"}
{"text":"We have happy hour here all the time because we have a fabulous waiter, Josh L.  He is so friendly and professional.  His service is always top notch.  The appetizers are 1/2 price during happy hour and the grandma's meatballs are great!! They also have a fantastic band on Thursday nights.  Arizona Blues Project!!"}
{"text":"You know, I have never been disappointed at Harold's. The BBQ is always great. The fish tacos my wife says are the best. But today for the first time we had breakfast there. Excellent. Try the pork chop & eggs. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. The food was pretty good and the meals were huge. I would have given 4 stars but some of our cups were dirty and had small wet paper in them..."}
{"text":"Saturday night Prime Rib n Beer!! AWESOME!! Great people in there as well!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to Harold's, as I live significantly far from here, but overall, it was a positive experience!  My fiancée and I came for a birthday celebration and really didn't know what to expect in terms of food, attire, etc. (It's actually unusual we didn't Yelp it!). We were pleasantly surprised to stroll in to a nice, laid back, country-style restaurant that had a very fun feel to it!   We were able to reserve a few tables that the staff kindly put together, however, it was quite difficult to hear someone right next to you when the live band was playing. It got very loud, so don't expect to have a very intimate setting! ;)   I'm not a fair judge of the food since I only ordered the potato skins, but those were actually pretty yummy! I will mention that service was a TAD slow in the beginning.. The potato skins took quite some time to come out, but it's really not worth complaining over. Our server was extremely friendly and helpful, which made up for it.   I don't think I'll be back to try other dishes because of 1) the distance from my house and 2) it's mainly just bar food from what I could see and I'm not the biggest fan! All in all, the experience was good. I got to bust out some country dancing moves, which I had no idea what I was doing, but the dance floor is just so welcoming that I had to give it a shot!"}
{"text":"This bar is awesome. I'm a fan for sure.  Margaritas on tap are actually really good. Not that I'm a margarita connoisseur but these are drinkable and strong. The bartenders are friendly enough and make drinks the way I like them - strong.  I've never had the food so I cannot comment on that aspect.  It's a classic cowboy bar, complete with a corral to park the horse you rode in on."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating in Carefree in a long while.  It definitely has a more Wild West feel to it and this restaurant is no exception.  Cowboys would certainly be at home here.  The atmosphere is very casual, but it almost felt too much like a cafeteria to my liking.  They have a decent selection of drinks, but I ended up going with a simple Kilt Lifter.  For dinner I got the BBQ Brisket, which turned out to be a good choice.  The meat was super tender and super delicious!  I just wish they went a little easy on the sauce.  It came with corn on the cob which was fantastic, and some coleslaw that was nothing to write home about.  Another note concerns the parking situation, which was not so good.  They have a pretty small lot, and with Buffalo Chips next door it was absolutely packed.  They charged $10 for a spot (although you got $10 off your tab inside as well).  This was meant to discourage people that were coming solely for the bull riding at Buffalo Chips to freeload off their parking lot.  However, with all the crowds of people on Carefree's tiny streets, it was a traffic disaster.  Aside from that, I would definitely come back again.  The food and selection is good it would be hard to go wrong here."}
{"text":"Huge cowboy restaurant/bar! If you like dancing to country music then this is your paradise. It's not mine. Though I am curious to try one of their steaks the next time I'm out here in the sticks."}
{"text":"The food here is surprisingly good- the brisket and BBQ beef ribs are exceptional. And other selections such as Italian food and steaks are great also.The only downside is being anywhere close during football season when the Steelers are playing- the place is severely overcrowded at that time"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place.  Food is awesome, vibe is so cool and the staff just rocks.  We have been in Cave Creek 3 times now and have eaten here multiple times each time.  Truly can't say enough wonderful things about Harold's."}
{"text":"We've been regulars at Harold's for 8 years and it's a FUN place - with great food.  The atmosphere is old West... with a side of Pittsburgh Steelers! This is the largest Steelers bar in the country, and you know it the minute you walk in.  Harold's has consistent food quality, and if you have special requests the staff always tries to be accommodating.   Our favorites: Prime Rib, Salmon (blackened), awesome CHILI, good burgers and even my favorite spinach salad in town!  The owner - Danny - is usually around and takes time to spend with the guests ... although we had the honor of him being in the kitchen the last time we were there... and my salmon was out of this world!   There is an off track betting site for the ponies too - and win or lose - it can be light hearted fun or serious biz ... depending on the races going off. Yeah - I lost my Derby bets!  If you are coming to the Phoenix area and want a taste of a small western town, HAROLD'S is it! Be prepared for a parking jam at peak hours ... so wear your boots because the hike to remote \"hill\" parking isn't for you city folks!"}
{"text":"Harold's Corral in Cave Creek gets 4 stars just for being a Steeler's Nation Bar... All you Black and Gold fans dont miss this restauant and Steeler's museum.of pictures of the Steeler greats. Plenty of Pittsburgh memoriabilia. Harold is from the Burgh and treats his fellow hometown customers with class. The only draw back is the the food could be better. Its ok but could be better. Stop in and have an Iron City Light and ask for Harold.... Plenty of room with multiple bars and a large wrap around porch. Check out the sign on the roof of the restaurant ... \" Heinz Field West\" ... Here We Go Steelers... Here We Go !   :-)"}
{"text":"Best damn chicken sandwich in the state."}
{"text":"I went to Harold's Cave Creek Corral for the first time tonight. I wasn't sure what to expect as far as the quality of the place. All I knew when my sister-in-law planned the outing with other family members was that there would be dancing lessons, a live band, a very country atmosphere and an all-you-can-eat fish fry.   The parking lot was packed when we first got there. A good sign. The establishment was huge. Very spacious. And yes, there was definitely a country atmosphere, but it was cool. Our waitress was a dangerously beautiful creature with a great ass, which for me, goes a long way. Her service was not superb, but still better than most places one could go to. At one point, someone in my party spilled a beverage on the table. I asked the beautiful server for some towels, which she promptly provided, but she didn't offer to help clean up the spill. I'm not really sure what the waitressing etiquette is on that one.   The dance lessons were more of a crash course in country and line dancing. I'm not much of a dancer, so when my two left feet were leading my sister-in-law in circles around the floor, our \"instructor\" informed me in a very annoyed manner that I was taking too big of steps. So he had me dance with his partner, the female instructor, who didn't teach me anything. So that portion of Harold's was the only thing I'd have to say was deliberately sub par.   The live band was a group called Young Country. They were decent, but I can't really critique a country band because I don't listen to country.   So after dabbling in the art of dance, we go back to our table where my appetizer of a cheese crisp is waiting for me. It is definitely crispy. Tasty, but too crispy. My all-you-can-eat fish fry (beer battered cod) then came out, and was quite delicious. Until, half way through, I noticed something foreign in the bite I had just taken and fished (no pun intended) it out of my mouth to find there was an extremely long strand of human hair in the piece of beer battered cod. I promptly notified the manager  --and this is the total redeeming factor to the whole Harold's experience--and he was so appalled by this discovery he personally took the food away and brought me another plate of which he watched over the preparation. He then comped me for the meal.   Hey, accidents happen. I understand. But it's the way the staff and manager of an establishment respond that really matters. And after that little bit of nastiness, the manager and waitress at Harold's did everything they could to rectify the situation. I also need to mention earlier in the evening that same manager did what he could to make our lighting situation better, even when it was something he really couldn't have helped without installing a light fixture over our table. A little bit of effort goes a long way.   All in all, Harold's was a pretty cool place. I think I'd rather go during happy hour next time. The dancing lessons and volume of the live band were overwhelming."}
{"text":"What kind of lunatic knocks a place like Harold's? In no way do they claim to have the worlds finest cuisine. It's a honky tonk that serves great greasy food and cheap beer. It's an alternative to the (equally fantastic) Buffalo Chip especially if you have kids, seeing as how the Chip caters more to a 21 and older crowd.   Harold's has great music, lots of football during the NFL season, though it is a Steelers haunt so if you're not a Steel fan(which I'm not), you might want to keep your negative views of Steeler Nation kinda hush hush.   Stuffed breadsticks are quite possibly the greatest accompaniment to a pitcher of beer you'll ever find. Basically stromboli as the east coast Italians(which I am, originally) would call it. The best happy hour in town for value and selection. BBQ beef sandwich is pretty killer too.   Bear with the servers; this place gets busy, so order two rounds at a time and have a little patience. You shouldn't be in such a rush when you're in Cave Creek anyway...it's off the beaten path for a reason. Been going here since the early 90's and the fact that it hasn't changed in 20 years tells you that they've got the right formula going."}
{"text":"We had been going to the Buffalo Chip, but that's no more. Our out of town guests wanted something western, so Harold's seemed like a safe try. Surprisingly, we had a great lunch, huge portions, good service, and nice outside seating. The bikers added to the experience. We'll be back."}
{"text":"So why have patio seating but apparently no waitresses serving the patio? I'll admit, bad service drives me crazy, but then a complete stranger (i'll assume one of the regulars?) came to our table and started screaming profanities at a member of our party for having the audacity to ask the waitstaff why she had told us a waitress would come to our table, and never appeared, i got a bad feeling about the place. The food was ok. I'm trying to be fair, but frankly i think you need to be a regular here to enjoy the \"experience\". Maybe it's a Steelers, thing? I did have a Diamondbacks hat on, perhaps, locals aren't welcome here? But the food really does have a back-east blah, \"it's sinful to stimulate even the tastebuds\" flavor. Still better than Texaz Grill, although, that's not saying much."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, waiter was awesome, nice casual restaurant that you will never feel out of place at. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Everyone knows about how great the bar is at Harold's and the live music but secretly Harold's is also a great place to eat. The food is great. Awesome place"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service was good.  We came back twice the same week.  Kids eating free on Monday and Tues definitely doesn't hurt.   We ate a ton of food.  Appetizers were good.   Beef ribs were huge.   Beef brisket was gigantic.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My 3-star rating is based on our group dining experience, not the bar experience, which looks quite entertaining and would probably deserve at least 4 stars if we were here for a night of drinking and dancing. However, we were here for dinner so that's what my review is based on.   Someone ordered chicken wings & drums as an appetizer and the 4 people in my group who ate them said they were among the best they had ever had. 3 people in our group complained that their drinks tasted watered down. I ordered wine, which was a couple dollars more than it should have been. Usually a $6 bottle of wine should run about $5-$6 a glass.   There were 6 in our party and our server did a great job meeting our drink needs. Of the 6 diners, we ordered 5 different entrees, all of which we agreed were luke warm and bland. 2 people did not appreciate the chicken fried steak. One ordered the salmon salad and said it was okay. The server was apologetic about the items weren't fond of and was eager to please. She took my order off of the bill without my asking because I wasn't able to eat it and she wanted to bring something else. I declined since there wasn't anything else that I wanted. Note: I am a vegetarian and while there are a couple vegetarian options, the ones I have ordered here in the past have been very unappealing.   Pros: Live country music Dance floor Indoor/outdoor seating & bars Service  Cons:  Mediocre food (Even for you carnivores)  Watered down mixed drinks Country music (I'm just not a fan)   Tip: Come ready to party in the evening or watch a game in the afternoon, but don't order food until you've had a few drinks and need to soak up some alcohol."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option to have no stars!!  We were regulars for a long long time and love down the road!  We just had 3 and a half hours of pure disgust!  We had a group of 12 with reservations like we always do. We didn't get a waitress for over 30 minutes and after ordering 30 minutes later they come out and say no more prime rib.....I understand this happens but what followed was an absolute circus. The manager could careless about this....all our food was messed up and once again they could careless. I'm not going to go into details because I'm done with this establishment and I'm sad to say this. Our waitress did her best but it was all management on this complaint tonight."}
{"text":"Nice to know some things never change.......the service at Harold's still sucks and the food is still \"eh\".   The nice thing about going to Harold's is that you don't ever have to assign a designated driver if you go there. The servers and bartenders will never get you another beer/drink fast enough for you to ever get drunk enough to not be able to drive yourself home.   Lots of other options nowadays in this town, you'd be better off checking out any of them."}
{"text":"Worst Service and lack of quality in food, especially the beef. I have given this place way to many chances and continue to see same results. If your looking for a place to just have a few drinks and yuk it up I guess Harold's will work for that; if your looking for great service and at lease good food you won't find it here. My suggestion would be dinner elsewhere and a stop at Harold's for a drink or two!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy the breakfast buffet.  A good value and great food. Our waitress Dina always makes sure we have an awesome experience."}
{"text":"My family has a Season Table at Harold's Corral in Cave Creek, AZ...also well known as Steeler Nation! It is the best place to go to enjoy the Steeler games, great food, great service and great atmosphere. Amanda, Cam and the entire staff are ALWAYS very friendly and attentive. We love it here and IF YOU ARE A STEELER FAN...THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE! Wear your black and gold and wave that towel!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed by management at this place. We came to watch the biggest NFL game of the week (Flex game), and called two days ahead to get ONE single TV To show this game. They gave us a reservation, promised they would show the game. When we showed up they refused to show it and said without a hint of remorse, \"sorry for the inconvenience.\" They were rude and didn't care in the slightest. The food, which I had the misfortune of trying on another occasion, will never be good enough to make me go back to that almost-clean bar for a game. If you like jerks, you'll like this place."}
{"text":"Best Place on the strip ! Food was awesome. Bathrooms clean and Service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"Been here lots of times, mostly during happy hour which has some great deals. This time a group of friends invited me for breakfast so we rode bikes up for the Sunday morning buffet. Well worth the $9.99.   Scrambled eggs, bacon. sausage, eggs benedict (YUM),  cream cheese blintzes, french toast sticks and biscuits with sausage gravy. HELL to the YES I'm in for all that!!!  Service was lame for everything from drink refills to replacement plates, and she even handed back all the checks to me to divvy up between the 12 of us (Really?). Oh well, no matter. I would still go back in a heart attack, I mean heart beat.   Did I mention they have \"all you can eat\" bacon?! MMMMmmmm, Bacon."}
{"text":"okay, you don't go to Harold's for service and nicey nice.  You go to Harold's to get drunk and eat a hamburger.  At least that is what I have done every time I have been to Harold's.  And have had an enjoyable time when those were my expectations. I used to live in Cave Creek right after I graduated from college, for about 4 months.  I didn't really even know it was called Harold's b/c I referred to it as the Biker Bar Restaurant."}
{"text":"Steeler Country?  More like Cougar Country!  We went to Harold's last night to see John Corbett and his band play.  Yes, I said John Corbett, from \"Northern Exposure\" and \"Sex and the City\".  He's a pretty good musician too.  The doors opened at 7, and it was a madhouse trying to find a seat.  They set up chairs all over the place on the West side of the bar near the stage.  We eventually gave up on finding 2 seats and ordered a beer at the bar.  Judging from the layout of the seats and the big open space in front of the stage, we figured we'd just stand and dance anyway.  We walked around a bit and decided to have dinner.  We were promptly seated and our order was taken.  I ordered the \"Strip Steak\" and my wife ordered the \"Cajun Scallops\" appetizer as an entree with a wedge salad.  The waitress brought my salad out first, and then about 2 minutes later returned with my wife's scallops.  We asked for her salad which she then brought out within a few more minutes.  My steak arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was very good.  We both agreed that the food was very good for what we paid and if we are ever in Cave Creek again, we will most likely return.  I'm giving them 3 stars for the unorganized mad house rush to get inside and for the timing of the food.    I do have to give big props to the owner of Harold's for bringing in John Corbett!  He sang for over 3 hours non-stop and then signed autographs and took photos with everyone who wanted.  He was very down to earth and really nice guy."}
{"text":"Local restaurant that looks more like a cowboy hangout. This is a fun restaurant with a wide selection from ribs, steaks, burgers, fish, shrimp, chicken and more. If you are ready for laughs and a good time, come on out. If you are stuffy and looking to criticize food presentation and service, go some place else. I've been here many times and always had good food, fun and laughs."}
{"text":"We were visiting from California and had a GREAT time here! We had out kids along, and went to see the bull riding next door earlier in the evening.  After bull riding, we really wanted to get some dancing in, and hoped by some miracle we could bring our kids into Harold's, on a Friday night, after 10 pm.  Yep!!! No problem, as long as they are with their parents, they are allowed inside. The band was great, and we dancing the night away :) No cover charge to get in... Sweet. And, their pricing on food and drinks was very reasonable. (Large pizza for $11).  We will definitely go back, when in the area!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go if you're from the Pittsburgh area. I moved from pittsburgh to Phoenix 2 months ago and stopped here for lunch today. I got a sammich (strip district special or something like that) with steak, cheese, slaw, fries (and a yinzer style) egg. The food was amazing. Down right delicious. The only thing I woulda changed would've been the sammich has more slaw and more fries on it. Great place to try if you're a yinzer and I will be back for a game or two during football season."}
{"text":"Horrible.  First off, it's a Steeler bar and I hate the Steelers.  Second, I have been here two times now and both times I was not served.  The first time I thought it was a fluke.  I was by myself and thought maybe it was just me.  So I came back a 2nd time with my girlfriend.  We sat down and waited about 20-30 minutes and servers walked by and ignored us time and time again.  Awful.  Avoid this dump at all costs."}
{"text":"This place is where you want to be on a Sunday morning with your biker buddies.  The breakfast buffet is hot when you arrive and the coffee flows as soon as you sit down.  My friends picked this spot for a breakfast stop during a morning motorcycle outing and it was great.  Piles of breakfast meats, excellent eggs benedict for a buffet and easily accessible for groups.  We walked in a dozen deep and the hostess didn't blink for a second.   Plus I have to express my gratitude for hostess who know what they are doing.  Harolds crew is what moves this from a 3 to a 4 star.  When you can look at a huge group and grab menus with a smile and say, \"right this way!\"  There is nothing more gratifying to someone jumping off a bike and coming into the nice cool, confines of a restaurant.  I am always shocked by restaurants that cater to the motorcyclist crowd who look at the size of our groups and get that look on their face automatically.  The crews I have ridden with are always respectful of our servers and always are in good spirits.  If you don't want people with money to burn, wanting to be in your establishment, then please put a sign up on the front door.    Thank you Harold's and I can't wait to see you for breakfast again."}
{"text":"Our family frequents this restaurant for Sunday Brunch. Food...tight, predictable, yummy. Waiter/waitresses are nice, yet sometimes the place is understaffed. Today was a blessing. Tony was a great waiter...he really was. He's a rare gem. Thank you Tony, and we recommend this eatery!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love to go out to breakfast on at least one of his days off-we've been here numerous times and have even taken family from out of town here to enjoy the menu!  What we love is that it's a fun atmosphere, friendly and helpful wait staff and good everyday homecooking.  My husband had the breakfast burrito w/ roasted potatoes.  He didn't complain about being hungry.  I was able to eat a great \"low boy\" omelet-their version of a healthy morning meal:  egg whites, spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes with enough melon slices to share w/ hubby and I had the marble rye.  coffee isn't the greatest, but it came frequently, fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Just before we moved into our nearby home the realtor recommended Harolds on Wednesday nights for prime rib. We finally made it last night and were not disappointed. I couldn't believe the serving we got for just $13 and the happy hour cocktail for just $6. The baked potatoes came with butter sour cream, cheese, and real bacon bits on the side so you could build your own. Our server was friendly and eager to please us. The meal was delivered quickly by another person before our salad arrived. Although we love speedy service,we do like to have our salad prior to, not after the main course. We only received the warm rolls so so, after asking for them. We loved the atmosphere in the large rustic corral that had many boots hanging from a beam on the ceiling. As we left through the outside eating area we saw a magnificent sunset. We will definitely bring our friends here when they come to visit."}
{"text":"I went to Harold's Cave Creek Corral with my family for mother's day. The place was hopping! There were bikers, there were families and more importantly, there was food! We all opted for the Sunday brunch which is offered at an impressive price of $10 per person. They serve bacon, sausage, eggs with peppers and onions, eggs benedict, seasoned potatoes, yummy bread with fresh fruit toppings, biscuits and melon. They also have a full menu of omelets and any other delicious breakfast/lunch/dinner option you could want.  The drive out was pretty, the restaurant was fun and yummy and I'll be happy to go back!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice authentic frontier atmosphere and kind service, but it wasn't quick at all. In fact, it was pretty sluggish. When we arrived we were told there would be a 10 minute wait, but ended up waiting for 45. When we were seated, we were taken to a table that had been open nearly the whole time we waited (we saw many empty tables during the wait). Next, we waited about an hour for our food to come, and when it arrived it was cold and dry, like it had been sitting around for a while. We visited on a Monday afternoon and it really wasn't very busy so I'm not sure what was going on. Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Dive bar with the fam could not have been better! Soooo much food! Be prepared for big portions and share! Great place to hang out for a while so make dinner and event and order a few items eat them (if you can!) then order more!"}
{"text":"Best nye in north Scottsdale.  Good crowd, good band, lots of fun.  Food was better than expected for a bar scene.    A huge thanks to Amanda who helped us get a seat and checked on us several times throughout the evening to make sure we were enjoying ourselves"}
{"text":"Good food, had a spinach bacon salad"}
{"text":"Was there Saturday night. Appalled when we tried to park that they had attendants collecting $10 per car to park. Ordered food at lower bar. Waitress was unfriendly and a snob. Good took forever to get to us. Friend had ordered a dinner salad that didn't come until after main course was served. Waitress commented that she \"had thought about it three times\" brought the wrong dressing. Pizza was thick with cheese and greasy. Bartenders ignore you and avoid eye contact . Left there and went to Buffalo Chip where we had great service friendly staff and had a good time. Will not hurry back to Harolds."}
{"text":"Fried Provolone cheese sticks, made here!  Mmmm. Those were tasty, unlike the lame stuff that most bars have which all comes from the same Phoenix distributor.  Finally a decent happy hour in the area, starting at 2pm as of writing this review.  Good appetizers list, good choices for happy hour specials.  Daytime service, seating, and parking were all very good (can't comment on night experience)."}
{"text":"I can't really remember what I ate while I was here...The drinks, however were plentiful and potent. (Grin, wink, wink)  I love the atmosphere, being born a desert rat (that is hillbilly minus the hills, frills plus cacti) I loves me some honky tonk! This place fit the bill, the band was fun, played a nice gamut of country gold, honky tonk, and new age country. My little and I had a great time cutting up the dance floor to it. Fun place to bring the munchkins (or your mate) for some \"San Antonio Stroll\", steaks and whatever else you fancy. PLUS- you just can't beat Carefree on a warm, spring night. You just can't- everything else is just icing."}
{"text":"Well let's start on a positive note. What a beautiful day. 79 degrees on Memorial Day weekend in Arizona priceless. Ok let's get down to the nitty gritty service was bottom of the barrel. Hostess was borderline nice. Our server taller guy with a beard and a very monotone voice with zero personality I got the feeling he had something else better to do than do the job I'm assuming he applied for. My dish got a soup and or salad option when I asked what was the soup option he said I don't know if they've made it yet? It's 2 in the afternoon?! Then he said he can check if I want. Yeah don't worry about it buddy I would hate for you to do your job. Then we had no silverware the bread never came he brought the check half way through lunch?! Ok I guess this is where I hurry up while he's pacing around seeing if my credit card was in the book. So all in all a huge fail I will never ever be back and since I'm a restaurant manager I will never recommend this place to my worst enemy. Hope this helps stay away."}
{"text":"Probably the best place in Arizona for a Pittsburgh Steelers fan :) food is delicious and the atmosphere is amazing !!"}
{"text":"It's 9pm on a wednesday night, I just landed from San Francisco and I hadn't slept the night before. I need sustenance.  Prime rib for $11.99? Sure why not. I just wish I had fresh horseradish.   Also, a little more attention from the waitress would've been nice. The place was EMPTY.  The prime rib was annihilated."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre. Bare side salad but plate was chilled. Grandma's meatballs were decent but would not order again. Beef ribs were good minus the plastic wrap that was left on bottom of them Bake potatoes were good even with having to fix yourself. Good cut Bone in ribeye but a little bland served with steamed broccoli"}
