{"text":"Great attentive service, the mixed dip plate was fantastic. The kebab was good, but a little dry. The lamp meat could have used more fat, as traditionally done. The knaffe was fantastic, and the turkish tea is a great way to finish the meal.

The place is very clean, with nice decor. A good place for a family to come."}
{"text":"Meals are very delicious and servers are great. There are a lot of traditional Turkish taste to choose, so you can easily pick one from the menu that you would love even if you are not familiar with them."}
{"text":"awesome ! try there guyss ! i am from turkey and they literally do the same delicate turkish food which we eat in turkey! lentil soup and lahmacun are awesome as well !!!"}
{"text":"This is not exactly real Turkish cuisine. How do I know? Because I am Turkish. Turkish dessert Kunefe and appetizers are okay but I can't say the same thing for the mains. When I pay $40 per person, I expect more than that."}
{"text":"It's a super nice restaurant with great decor and ambience. We went on a Friday night and the place was somewhat packed but we were able to get seats right away. I liked the crowd- it was mostly families which is not surprising considering the area. Our server was really great and came by a few times to ask how the food was and if we needed anything else. We tried the pasha sautéed, iskender kebob and pepper steak and really enjoyed everything. Our food was flavourful and reasonably priced! Will definitely come back again to try some of other dishes."}
{"text":"What an amazing place! There decor is so stunning, the service and presentation is top notch. The food is absolutely delicious. We tried some starters, Mantis and the meat platter as well as their signature dessert with Turkish coffee which were all amazing!! Can't wait to come back again. :)"}
{"text":"I was not at all impressed with this place. It was completely empty when we walked in, that should have been our red flag. Not 1 single person other than the waiter. It would have been nice if the menu had some pics so we could be familiarized with what we were ordering. The food portion size was very little in comparison to the price. We ordered a Chicken Skewer dish with an extra Skewer of lamb, but that was missing. Then when we inquired about it, the waiter brought us the lamb skewer of 4 small pieces of meat. When the bill came, we were charged for 1 extra chicken skewer AND 1 extra lamb skewer. When we told him, he corrected it, but I was not please about that error. All the dishes were bland, dry, and just not satisfying at all. The only good item was the kunefe dessert which was served warm and was delicious. The waiter was a very nice young gentleman. I gave this place 2 stars, 1) for the service, and 2) for the dessert. I would have given them 5 stars if 1) portion size was bigger, 2) the price was more modest, and 3) the food actually tasted good."}
{"text":"Great food (Adana Kebab and Beyti Kebab) and service+ a pleasant environment"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Best Kunefe ever and Turkish chai after a long time:-).  Worth every penny. Will definitely come back. Awesome decor unlike some other cheap places. I have to say the owner has great taste....still trying to decode the poetry on the wall though...

Well... thanks to our server Damla for translating it for us:-)"}
{"text":"Three of us dined at Pasha on a cold winters evening.  The lentil soup served in a crock with lemon was scrumptious.  We shared zucchini pancakes, babaganoush and a donner kebab - all nicely prepared and flavorful.  The house made bread was delicious.  We had a lovely warm freshly prepared dessert of shredded phyllo pastry, cheese and honey topped with ground pistachio nuts. The service was very good. This restaurant, which serves authentic Turkish cuisine, is quite new to the area and we plan to return."}
{"text":"Amazing food! One of the best Turkish restaurants I've been to. Our server was nice and the staff was very friendly. I had the lentil soup for starter and manti for my main course and for desserts I had kunefe with chai to end the night. Everything I ordered was delicious! I truly recommend this place if you're looking to have a taste of an authentic Turkish meal."}
{"text":"We went there today, on a windy and cold winter day. The waitress seated us by the window. The wind was literally blowing inside and it was freezing cold. Luckily the restaurant was quite empty, we were replaced to another table.  Decoration was very nice. Table cloths were double layered and clean. Music was just right.
We ordered cacik, eggplant in tomato sauce and a large salad as appetizers. The fresh bread was good but nothing extraordinary. Appetizers and salad were all delicious and fresh but the portions were too small for the price. I was wondering the size of the small salad if this was the large one. 
For main dishes we ordered sizzling sauteed lamb, Adana kebab and Turkish dumplings. Lamb dish was huge, 2 of us shared. The meat was very tender and delicious. Adana was a bit bald and dry. Dumplings were ok. The dough could be thinner. For desert we had creme caramel. It was decorated with a very unnecessary chocolate syrup. I would definitely prefer its natural caramel juice. We ended our dinner with tea, which is a Turkish tradition. Tea was tasteless and was not fresh.  The bill was too high for what we had."}
{"text":"I've tried all Anatolian cousins in GTA and I can say that your business is the best in the area. Prices are bit higher than average but It definitely worths if I compare service quality. Delicious foods, beautiful interior decoration, good humored personal. And waiters were talking English even if they have Turkish background, this is quite professional. I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise! 
We received an invite to Anatolian's Turkish and after reading the only two previous reviews, I have to admit that I was. . . uncertain. 

So I was relieved to find myself in a very comfy and family-friendly atmosphere.  The servers are very polite and the chef obviously cares about his patrons.

We tried several of the dips/spreads (humus, babaganush, etc.)  and they were all very tasty - made even better with the fresh bread. The biggest hit was the eggplant with tomato sauce. It was so fresh and savoury. 

I also loved the spicy meatballs, kofte. So crispy on the outside while moist and tender inside. And the flavour  was almost indescribable.  I really enjoyed the blend of spices.

The spinach and feta pide was huge! and thank goodness it was also very good. I love pide!

Dessert was Kadayif, a sweet shredded wheat dish that I could eat every day for the rest of my life. And the baklava deserved a moment of silence. It was amazing.

All in all - the real deal. I'd go back again and again....
and for dessert - yet again."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Turkish food.  The sigara borek appetizer and kuneffe dessert are amazing.  Just wish the prices were a tad bit lower so I could visit more often!"}
{"text":"I went a few months back and although I only went once, there is no way I'm going back. The decor was alright, very Turkish. I'm being generous with the two stars that I gave. First off, it was freezing inside the restaurant so that did't help with the experience. We got our food which was overpriced considering quality and the quantity. My friend ordered something and it came to her completely cold, so she asked if they would heat it up and the waitress was hesitant and seemed a bit irritated. My other friend got one of their \"popular dishes\" and was nothing to be impressed by. Overall, the food was below average and pricey."}
{"text":"Positive:
Excellent food
Fast service (not a lot of rush, promptly seated and order was brought out quickly)
Great decor and ambience 

Negative
Hostess doesn't speak / understand English very well, result being in lack of communication which can be bad - a few slips ups but negligible"}
{"text":"Amazing food and very friendly service. Ordered a mixed grill plate and was not disappointed. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent the one reason I give it a 2 star is because of the real bad swage smell in the restaurant. I was there this afternoon with 5 of my family members and all of us got stomach pain because of the smell. The smell came out when we were half way eating our food! 
The other reason is because we had to wait so long for the tea to arrive after we finished eating and had asked for it..
The waiter could have brought the teas while we were waiting for the take out we ordered for a family member who couldn't eat with us in the resturant. Instead, the waiter brought the take out and brought the teas after!
Also, I called after we got home just to let them know how my mom got sick badly of the smell and how she through up after we got home but, the person who answered the phone didn't understand what I was saying and transfered me to another person who was not listening what I'm tell her and kept asking me if I wanted to make a reservation over and over again!

Don't think we will go back again 
Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place serves authentic Turkish food. Its got a nice atmosphere, with more formal setting compared to most Turkish restaurants in town. Lots of parking spaces is also a plus. The staff is super nice and polite. The only reason I did not rank them as 5 star is that the food portion is on the small side. I will go back to try more items from their menu."}
{"text":"So I recently had food here and from the outside it looks dead and not appealing however as soon as you walk in. The beautiful open space is a fresh breath to look at. 


My husband had the chef special and let me tell you I wanted it. It's a mix of all sorts of kebob. With a salad on a platter. 

I had manti which is mini ravioli with meat in it and warm yogurt over it. It was yummy

We both had the humus with pastrami in it and it was served with fresh baked bread. 

We will be back with family and friends since it's hard to find a halal restaurant that has both good food and good ambiance to sit in."}
{"text":"If you want to taste real Turkish food, you should visit Pasha. And I loved the new logo of the restaurant:)"}
{"text":"Big portions!! One platter and a couple appetizers are enough for two people. The hummus is fresh and delicious. Baklava was delightful. Service is lovely, but I think the waitress was a bit nervous or new.

The best thing to get is the Doner which is a rotating selection of meats of the moment. Included rice, red cabbage slaw, and assorted grilled veggies.

Decor is nice and bright and inviting. A great place to bring a family of any size!"}
{"text":"I'm not posting this review for the coupon, didn't even use it
But this place is great. Our server was awesome, so lovely. Great service.
Decor is so beautiful, Turkish traditional, very cosy which matches the Turkish music.
Food was awesome. I had Adana kebap, so tasty and very close to authentic Turkish cuisine. My boyfriend ordered Kari?ik pide, was not bad but not so great. 
Künefe, on the other hand was amazing, perfectly baked. Künefe is baked in a steel dish on direct flames, can be easily overbaked and burnt, but this one was the best künefe I've ever had in Toronto (I tried it in 3 other restaurants).
The only thing is the price, one could say it's a bit pricy. 
After all, I'll go back there for sure"}
{"text":"Pasha most delicious Turkish food I have ever eat in Canada ambience is amazing the service is top and the staff is very very friendly. I would recommend this food to everyone I know. The food is on point it was the 3rd time I came here and the food never change the quality. The meat and bulger and the veggies are cooked so well.this is what I like about the restaurant a lot. They serve bread and olives(without any charges) I ordered grilled chicken thigh and lamb chops it was very tasty and well cooked. The waitress came often to ask if we need anything which we like too. Will go soon again"}
{"text":"We've passed by Pasha multiple times but the construction outside may be hindering people from actually going here. Once you enter, it definitely feels upscale - plush red booths, beautiful decor with tile work and lanterns and a warm welcome. 

We ordered: 
Manti 
Sucuk pide 
Mix platter 
Lamb seesh plate 

We got the pide first - sucuk was delicious and I think they used fresh cheese with was oh-so-good. Next, manti was on the smaller portion size but the quality was really good and consistent. Dare I say, Turkish Manti is better then Afghan Mantu? 

Next, we received both the mix platter and lamb seesh. Mix platter was MASSSIVE! Easily could feed three people, juicy chunk of beef, lamb and chicken, served with pickled radish and rice. 

The taste was amazing, slightly on the medium well side but personal preference, I like it medium or medium rare. 

Service was top notch, my water was always filled and they were courteous and friendly. I would say, this is one of the best places to eat in Thorncliffe Park. It is definitely on the pricey side, our bill came to $100 with tax and tip. I think it'd be great for a special dinner or a birthday dinner with friends, it can easily fit close to 80-100 people. Lots of space and I hope it does well - this particular place in this strip mall has a tendency to not to well (Burger King, some Carribean place, another Turkish place have been in this exact location before Pasha opens). 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fairly tasty food, nice and upscale (for neighbourhood) decor and friendly service. But there are better Turksih spots in the city. 

Repeat: No"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant several times,  and always make a point to come in if we're in this neighbourhood. Gulteken (the owner) is a lovely, generous man and the service staff are also really friendly,  especially as we usually are recognized when we come in now. The kunefe here is quite delicious,  the best I have been able to find in any restaurant in the GTA - I have constantly been looking for good kunefe since first eating it in Syria. Come and eat here if you're looking for delicious Turkish food (including Middle Eastern kunefe)."}
{"text":"Pasha is a fantastic Turkish experience. We stumbled upon this place and were incredibly thrilled with our food and experience. 

The service was so very warm and hospitable -- we were well attended to, not rushed, and felt as if we were being welcomed into someone's home. In addition, the food came quickly. The decor was formal, with colourful drapes and eclectic ceiling tiles. Definitely a great place to bring guests. The food is even served on wood cutting boards.

We came on a weekday, so we didn't get to experience the full menu.  However, we loved the Turkish ravioli, which comes in a yogourt sauce.  The food is all Halal, so that was a plus.

All in all, a place we'll definitely be coming back to again and again!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for the lamb. For me, the lamb is always perfect and delis. 
The ambience is 4.5 
The food is great 4.5
my only complaint is the server we had, she was not helpful and slightly snobbish. She forgot our order couple of times, did not apologize for doing so. but overall the whole experience was great! I would go back over and over again."}
{"text":"Everything is on point! Ever since I discovered Pasha I have been bringing my friends and family to here. Their pasha mix, Turkish tea and kunefe are my favorites, and service never disappoints. Great value for the excellent quality and quantity."}
{"text":"The reviews for this place stand true. If you haven't tried Turkish before, try Pasha out. The staff is very helpful and attentive. We wanted to try a lot of stuff so we went for the sampler appetizer, and sampler kebabs. The pide and the kunefe )dessert) are really worth trying."}
{"text":"Could be much better.  My standards for Turkish cuisine are high but even the ingredients in this case were either old or not well chosen.  Food was oily for whatever reason, and the oil was of poor quality. 

For those not accustomed to Turkish food, this place can still be your introduction.

Almost forgot: the service was inaccurate and sparse."}
{"text":"Was there with 7 people on a Sunday afternoon. Made reservation for lunch although when I got there there wasn't too many people and there are plenty of tables so really didn't need a resrvation.  Inside is redesigned and very nice e and modern. Even the parking lot is new.

We ordered a cold platter app which comes with 4 cold apps and bread. Also got a huge mixed platter of meats to share as well as a pide  and extra skewers of grille meat. Followed by kenefe and tea. 

Gotta say thay that overall the food was great. The meats were grilled perfectly were juice and tender. The fresh bread is very nice. The cold humus babaganoush potato salad and eggplant was very nice and plentiful for us to share. The fires and rice on the side are good as well. Overall this place serves pretty decent middle eastern food compared to other spots. My favourite dish is the kinafe. It's much better than other places I've had it. 

This place is a good place to host people or come for an occasion but definitely not one for daily Turkish eating. There are cheaper Turkish options out there with similar food. But again for the quality of food and ambience and service the pretty penny is worth it."}
{"text":"The decor of the restaurant is colourful. A mix of modern and traditional design.

We placed our order within minutes of being seated, and received complimentary warm bread and seasoned olives while we waited for our food. 

Our ordered consisted of:
The lamb chops with fries ($24), and 
the doner pide ($16).
Good sized portions, 2 dishes can feed 3 people. Meats were seasoned very well and cooked to a perfect medium. Not under-cooked and not dry.
To finish the meal, I ordered a Turkish coffee.

If your palette is geared towards bold flavour & seasoned meats, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"If you have the taste for authentic Turkish cousins then look no further. Great food, great service for all. Don't forget the deserts."}
{"text":"This new place has potential but not there yet. I tried \"manti' dish (meat dumplings in yogurt sauce). It was bad. The yogurt sauce was very very sour like it turned bad. It tasted like they reheated the dish with the sauce and all. Which is a big no no. 
Others got 'beyti' ( ground beef skewer wrapped in lavash bread) and lamb shish kabob. Lamb shish was very good. Beyti was also pretty good.  Desserts, we got keskul, sutlac and Kazandibi. They were all divine. Decor is nice and it's large and clean. Fast and friendly service. I would check it out again to see if their manti has improved."}
{"text":"Very very good food and service. Their appetizers is super good; very specific. The pickled choices are terrific too. Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place.

My family came here for Mother's Day. It's a Turkish place that serves halal meat (as do many if not most other places in this area). We had a reservation for 9pm. When we went in, it was busy but not so busy that we couldn't pick our table. We didn't get that chance though. We were seated on the side where two large parties with small, fussy babies and children were. This affected our atmosphere.

While the servers were helpful and friendly, I found the overall service to be odd. We ordered a chili dip and zucchini patties to start. The server brought out the olives and bread to start. Then we got just the dip (no bread) and the zucchini patties. Not sure if the dip came late for some reason, or if there was accompanying bread that was forgotten? Anyway, the chili dip is not good. But the zucchini patties are amazing.

For mains, we ordered the chicken skewers, the adana kebab, the iskender kebab and the Turkish ravioli. The ravioli was the worst thing ordered. the past was small so you could barely taste the meat in it and it was covered in a tangy youghurt and sauce. The chicken was byfar the best meat. It was so succulent and juicy! The iskender kebab is basically the doner kebab with more stuff. It was pretty good. The adana kebab is made of ground veal and it was okay.

We finished with pistachio ice cream which was delicious and fragrant (of rose water).

There's definitely things I enjoyed about this place and I'd like to come back. However, I wasn't completely wowed, especially considering the price, so returning isn't high on my list of priorities at the moment."}
{"text":"While Toronto may have a ton of halal options, this is as up scale there is going to be with not only fancy decor, but amazing service and very flavorful food with decent prices. I came here with a group of 18 people. Calling ahead and making reservations was very easy, the owner of the restaurant is very hospitable and the staffers were very sweet and attentive for my large crowd. We started off with ordering a few of the dip samplers, and the owner threw in a few for free on the house. We then ordered one of their specialty beef dishes, along with a few mixed plates of grilled meets. The presentation, meat quality and sides were very tasty and well worth the wait (which wasn't too long). We ended the meal with a birthday cake for my mom. They graciously kept the cake at the back of the kitchen and came out with it when we were ready for the surprise. I highly recommended this restaurant for your next celebration, or if you're in the mood for all around excellent halal experience."}
{"text":"Felt like we travelled to a different part of the world. Great flavours, a bit pricey, but clear menu explanations helped. Solid kebab, intense turkish coffee, tea was tea. Bread was amazing."}
{"text":"Came here with the both our kids (4 & 2) and the staff were super accommodating considering we were a walk in on Saturday night.
Food was tasty and ambience pleasant. If we're ever in the area again we'd stop in again!"}
{"text":"I just ate here last night and was very impressed! The decor, atmosphere, and ambiance is great with no screaming kids,  overly loud music, or clanging dishes and utensils. The food tasted delicious and I'm pakistani so getting me food that I like is difficult since I'm used to masala and spices in my food. My husband and I  ordered chicken sautéed and Karisik and both tasted very good. The chicken entrée was comparable to pakistani chicken jalfrezi and the Karisik was a flatbread with various toppings. It is a great dish if you want to sample the pides and don't know which one you like. The serving size is generous. We both ate until we were overfilled and still had leftovers. This was after a 17 hour fast so that must have been a lot of food. Also, the service is exceptional. The severs are very polite,  friendly, and accommodating. We got our food only about 10 to 15 mins after ordering so basically we were in and out in an hour. You can't say that for many restaurants these days! I will definitely be coming here again.

PS: This used to be called Anatolian. I suppose it's under new management."}
{"text":"Good food, but pretty expensive for the portion size. The chicken and kabobs were great, and so was the bread as well. The way they presented the turkish tea and coffee was really nice, and the kanafe was delicious! Great restaurant overall, the only thing is that portion sizes are relatively small for a med/middle eastern restaurant, and prices are quiet expensive, especially considering the area and neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The ambient is calm, server's friendly and food above average ( slightly canadianized but even worth). Will go back again"}
{"text":"Amazing food , beautiful place and very polite staff .  We were 4 people , ordered 4 dish appetizer and the kabob combo which was big enough for 4 people  Defiantly coming back"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant through Yelp. The first time we decided to stop by and do take out because the kids fell asleep driving back from the science centre. We ordered a dish that had 3 different types of meats. Grilled chicken, Lamb kabobs and grilled beef. It was soooo delicious. Today, we went to the science centre again and stopped by to eat there. The service was very good (prompt and accommodating). I was bummed out that a few of the lamb dishes were not available, but what we ordered was still very good. I can't remember the name of all the dishes, but we ordered the zucchini pancake, shepards salad, the Turkish style lamb gnocchi and the amazing desert that has ice cream and cheese. We will definitely go back again when visiting the science centre."}
{"text":"Highlight of the restaurant = Kanafe(dessert)

Service (Slow)
Been here twice, only because we absolutely love the kanafas they serve. 
The service is on the slow side as they are pretty understaffed for a restaurant that size, so the waiter forgets things, have to ask for water again and again and all that fluff, can't blame them, they have soo much on their plate, but i can blame the management.

Atmosphere (Good)
I dig the ambiance of this place, quite, and family oriented environment. The seating is comfortable, the table is at the perfect height.

Main dishes (Meh)

the food is very pricey!! one dish of Iskander would be good for one person and its for $18, I would have been fine with the price but there is really nothing unique about the food, just a lot of tomato flavour.

Pasha dinner  - is good for two people, they grill the meat perfectly but it doesn't really have a lot of flavour to it, and the rice that comes with doesn't go with the grilled meat at all, definitely need some sauce for flavouring.

If i were to go there myself, i would go there for the kanafas, as they have the best out of all the turkish/middle-eastern places i have been to."}
{"text":"The Adventure starts as soon as you walk through the doors. Walk past the faux fireplace to the bar, and as you wait to be seated, the heady smell of incense and the melodic Turkish music will entertain you. You will be greeted by the lovely hostess who will seat you in one of their lavish booths and offer you some Turkish tea to chase the chills away, then comes the complimentary olives and bread to stave off your hunger pangs.

MY 2 FRIENDS AND I ORDERED:
- Lentil soup needed a squeeze of lemon and hot sauce.
- Walnut salad is a good side salad, very fresh and light.
- Chicken skewer - 2 skewers of chicken breast meat, served with salads and a side of your choice: tender, juicy and delicious.
- Lamb skewer - 2 skewers of lamb meat, served with salads and a side of your choice: tender, juicy and delicious.

The hostess served as our waitress as well: excellent service. 

As you leave, grab a few cloves to freshen you breath and splash on some eau de cologne (samples available at the front) to elevate your mood even more. Such a beautiful place to relax and get away from the daily grind."}
{"text":"Really excellent food.  We started with the Acili Ezme which is a garlic and tomato spread (on wonderful, warm bread).  They don't skimp on the garlic (which is a favourite of mine).  The Inegöt Köfte (Turkish meatballs--which aren't ball-shaped at all) was delicious.  Really unusual and fantastic spice combinations.  The taste buds were dancing.  The Karisik Pides was a mixed combination of all the pides (sort of like pizza) they have.  So you get a sample of everything.  Fantastic flavours.  Too much, though!  We couldn't even finish half the meal.  Not even close.  Great food, great portions and the service was perfect.  I'll definitely go back and work my way through the menu.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"There are much better spots for Turkish food in the GTA, especially for Pide. When you are paying $40-$50 per person for basic items that you could probably just make at home, you expect a lot better. It feels like you are paying for the decor and ambiance than the actual food itself. 

The Kunife dessert is great, but once again pricey and very small in portion."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place when I ordered it. Unfortunately the food was not as great as I had hoped. 

Food was quite bland, it wasn't as tasty as I had hoped. I would skip this place and go to Fat Pasha instead."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Beautiful decor and spacious. 
Good for groups and large parties

Extensive menu with many Turkish food options. Noticed there were a few dishes only available on weekends.

We got the Turkish tea - a bit too bitter for my taste.

Adana kebob meal - meat was tender, juicy, and flavourful. Really really good. A

Donor pide - meat wrapped in Pastry. Very delicious! Must try. Only available on weekends. A+


We had the kunefe for dessert. It's shredded wheat wrapped with mozzarella cheese with syrup. It was pretty delicious! A

5% off the bill if you show your Yelp.

It is pretty expensive because portions are small. I recall getting two kebobs when I go to other restaurants and it's priced the same. This is why I give this place a 3.5 star. I would give it a 4.5 for food but the price and portion size drops it by one. Still worth a try though."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. I found the portion of the Turkish ravioli small but the Iskander kabab was awesome. The meat melted in the mouth. A bit on the higher side in prices but worth it. Decor and ambiance was good."}
{"text":"This Turkish restaurant in the heart of Overlea is intriguing from the outside. Modern art on the windows, traditional art inside, a nice seating area and professionally dressed servers. However, our experience tonight had good elements and not so great elements that really left us with mixed reviews.

They have a varied menu with many traditional meat options. Their drink selection is primarily Turkish specialties and a few types of pop. Considering I hate anything carbonated, I ended up just drinking water and a glass of Turkish tea (which they supply free of charge). Personally, I quite enjoyed the tea and should have ordered it earlier; however, my dad thought the taste of the tea was relatively bitter-sweet (literally) and was not bowled over by the experience.

For our mains, we both ordered house/restaurant specialties. I ordered the sautéed vegetables with chicken. The dish overall was quite good except I felt the chicken was dry and tasteless. My dad had their lamb beyti and quite enjoyed it.

For the majority of the meal, servers were very attentive and courteous; however, when it came time to pay for our meal, all the servers disappeared. It took us 20-30 minutes to find and call over a server to get the bill for us.

Overall, I highly doubt I will return to this location; however, there was nothing significantly wrong with our experience. It just didn't 'wow' us."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant a number of times when it was under old management (called Anatoli) and again yesterday under the new management (called Pasha's). 

Under the old management, the food was really good, but the service was really slow and bad. The staff didn't understand English and it was difficult for them to get the order right. Usually they forgot stuff or didn't bring it at all.

Under the new management, the staff are all the same, so English is still a problem.  The menu has been redone and all the descriptions have been removed, so now it's just Turkish names without any English meanings. Having to speak to the waiter to have him explain everything was quite an ordeal.  Unfortunately, the service is still really slow. The food is quite good - it's the same as the previous restaurant, but new management has also increased the prices and (I think) reduced the portion sizes. So you're paying $6.50 for a tiny cup of soup now. I was surprised.

If you're ok with paying a bit more and know what you want, then the food is good. I would recommend the Kanefe(?) dessert. It is very yummy.

The reason for 2 stars? While the food is good, it just isn't worth the bad service and the price."}
{"text":"First time trying turkish food in Toronto. The food was amazing!!!!! It was very very good. The staff were friendly . Loved this place"}
{"text":"We came across this place quite by accident, and actually a nice \"find\".

Nice decor and friendly staff.
Good offerings, although I will say that I am pretty new to Turkish food --- lots of Mediterranean type tapas and appetizers, and really good kabobs, and lamb dishes.

They do the turkish coffee perfectly at the end -- served with ice water and a piece of turkish delight!  That was the best.

Unfortunately they were out of the regular baklava --- so I guess we will have to go back and see if next time they have it!"}
{"text":"Only good things! I don't know how would you discover this place unless you live in this area but I was near by and hungry and I'm so glad I came here. We had the Pasha's Sautéed (lamb and fries) and the Turkish style meat balls as well as the 6 dips and pistachio style baklava, coffee and tea. Everything was excellent but the Pasha's Sautéed was extra special, just delicious!"}
{"text":"Guys, honestly I have been dying to eat here since I heard they have pide, but this place was an utter disappointment. The exterior of the restaurant was in shambles, but that can be excused as construction is going on and once you enter the interior - it is spacious, colourful, and welcoming.

My mother and I had come here and ordered the doner pide, the cheese pide, and the turkish ravioli called \"manti.\" The doner pide had lamb and although, I'm not a huge fan of lamb, the gamey-ness was so strong that I took one bite and passed it to my mother. She couldn't even stomach it herself. The cheese pide was average - I felt the cheese they used could have been of a higher quality with a higher salt content. The cheese was rubbery and lacking in flavour. As for the manti or the turkish ravioli, let's just say that whole dish looks great on photos, but the flavour doesn't compare. Chewy ravioli with a thick yogurt smeared on top - the ravioli claims to have meat inside, but my taste buds didn't get the message. I have a feeling the ravioli is frozen and it really lacks seasoning. A sprinkle of salt really goes a long way.

For dessert, we ordered the turkish tea and kunefe, which at a whopping $9, makes you really question minimum wage standards. Both my mother and I really enjoyed the dessert - we saved a little bit of the kunefe the next day and even cold it was scrumptious.

I commend Pasha's for providing clean halal food in an alcohol-free setting and their customer service is on point. In fact, I would only return to Pasha's for their waiters & waitresses -- kind, hospitable, friendly and pleasant. We had some great chats with a few of them and it really lifted up our spirits. Pasha's is on the pricier side with not a lot of bang for the buck. I hope the quality of their food and their prices improve because I would really like to return again."}
{"text":"I got a soup that called mercimek .It was delicious.but bad things was delay. there was  just a waitress  that worked  and served for all people .second,it's  Turkish restaurant with Turkish menu but the waitress can't speak turkish."}
{"text":"I ate here with a group of 10-12 people.  Everything was very good until the bill.  Rewinding, all the main entrees (four) listed as beef really had lamb mixed and I detest lamb so my choices dwindled so I ended up ordering boring chicken kabob.  Chicken was average tasty huge chunks, but nothing special, as it was a bit bland and wasn't overcooked/not dry so that was good.  The plate was huge and came with salad and grilled vegetables.  The grilled green peppers were raw and would have been tastier if grilled longer.  Beautiful ambience due to decor and clean.

The Manager whom identified herself as Bulgarian was our server and she was friendly until payment.  For payment, she started on the opposite end and didn't inform everyone that tip was already included and it was noticed after some paid (I couldn't hear much because of the long table), BUT I heard the Manager scold and yell at two people from my table whom caught the tip and asked for a refund on the double tip (one was clarifying what the service charge was).  The Manager said to both separately (yelling) that \"It's not my job.  It's your job to check.  I already told people earlier\" and one of them told her not everyone was aware since she was on the other end of the table.  She complained and was annoyed at having to do two-three refunds (not everyone bothered to ask).  This was extremely unprofessional and we felt that she did this on purpose (being dishonest)  hoping nobody would notice or wouldn't bother doing anything so she'd have extra tip.  Regardless of her intention, she should have handled the refunds in a professional manner.  I knocked off 1-star for the rude behaviour."}
{"text":"Great decor, and even better food. We ordered the mixed meat pide, grilled chicken and the steak. Would recommend to anyone curious to try Turkish cuisine."}
{"text":"Pasha authentic  restaurant is the best  turkish cuisine, I've ever seen in Toronto. The warm environment and friendly service is making the enjoyable hours unforgettable and gives you the expectations. I tried \"Beyti kebab\" and as the desert  \"künefe with ice cream\" on the top and I can only say that if you haven't  had that experience, I suggest you to come by and add new tastes into your lives."}
{"text":"Yummy !

Everything I ordered at this is extraordinarily delicious.

Large portions, which makes the at first relatively high prices, completely fair ! (You can easily share any dish between two people)

Staff are very nice and attentive !

I recommend that you get the cold appetizers chef's mix ! It's a dish of a sample of all their cold appetizers, and they are all delicious. Beyond delicious.

They have a turkish pizza (forgot what it's called), i also recommend you try that (you can get it as an appetizer and share it with 3-4 people)

Try their traditional Aryana ! It's like Persian dough! 

And finish your meal off with a turkish coffee and a baklava !

Go with family, your date, friends, anyone!  And Enjoyyyy!"}
{"text":"Really love the decor and atmosphere :) money well spent.

Service was fast and friendly; food was good. Will be coming back to try the other options on the menu"}
{"text":"A La Turka! Delicious and plentiful! Kufete with Turkish coffee for desert is a must!"}
{"text":"The staff was pleasant. The service was fast and the food was hot and freshly made.

The place was neat and clean. 

It's kind of like formal dining. The prices aren't cheap."}
{"text":"Decided to visit this place as a bday treat...I was not disappointed. Wonderful service (my glass was never empty) & amazing fresh food. Enjoyed everything I ate & took a whole bag full of take out. I would visit here again...hopefully soon."}
{"text":"We specifically went out of our way to buy a gift card for this restaurant to give to a friend. Their website states that gift cards are available in store and when we walked in and asked to purchase one the woman there flat out said \"No\". 

Also the location, specifically the parking lot, is not kept in very nice condition. We expected much more."}
{"text":"Excellent Turkish food everything is good here I specially want to thank the menager Mr.Arda
Keep up the good work guys .
Bizlere gostermis oldugunuz ozel ilgiden dolayi sizlere cok tesekkur ederiz.Yemekleriniz hakikaten
Leziz servisiniz mukemmel .Ozellikle Arda beye tesekkur ederiz"}
{"text":"I chose to come here based on the pictures I saw from the interior and the reviews I read here. I love Middle Eastern food, but never had Turkish food. So, I followed my curiosity and decided to bring my family here to try the 4 star Turkish restaurant. The plaza this restauant is located at is very ghetto, and the parking lot was empty, but the interior design and the comfy pillows in the booths surely impressed me. They brought the appetizer and main food together. The chef's appetizer plate consisted of 6 different items, which were very average in taste. I have had much better Hummus and Babaghanouch elswhere. I gave Lahmacun a try and it was alright (it's very mild in terms of spiciness and has ground beef and cheese with herbs). The only thing I really liked was the Kunefe dessert. It's like baklava but has cheese inside! trust me you want to try this one! Also, the Ayran (home made yogurt drink) is very thick and delicious. I was surprised how average the tea was, considering all the excellent reviews. The tea was nothing special in my opinion. If I come here again, I'll try their other pizzas."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service with a menu that is not overly complex. The place looks quite bland on the outside but is actually quite delightful on the inside! 

We had hummus and fresh made bread to start; then each ordered a dish: Okra Bamya (stewed Okra with tomatoes, is vegetarian but you can ask them to add chicken/beef if you like), Meatballs (beef based but shaped more like fingers/kofta), Beef Kabab beledie (shredded beef on a bed of bread cubes, smothered in tomato sauce w/ side of thick yoghurt). All entrees came with either rice or fries. Kunefeh desert was very good but the entrees was so enormous, we had one shared amongst 4 people! :)"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurants based on the positive reviews I found on their yelp page, but unfortunately I was highly disappointed and do not think that I would visit again, which is quite bad, because I had some hopes of finding my new favorites Turkish restaurant.

The interior decor of the restaurant is beautiful, its light colours and authentic tiles and millwork are very inviting, and certainly set up happy mood once you come.

Two major issues here, first one is the menu itself, being an authentic Turkish restaurant, they still miss out on so many great dishes, and kind of cutting it short with the very minimum basics of the cuisine.

And the second biggest issue is the food itself, it lacks any type of flavor, Turkish or not, and the portioning is very small, they put shop Pro Tien on top of a puffy piece of bread, so the plate looks very big and appetizing, but the portion Is half what you would expect for $16-$20 per plate, for similar cuisines.

We tried a few different items, five appetizers, three types of entrées, and one dessert and unfortunately they all failed to impress."}
{"text":"Cons 

Terrible food! 
My chicken smell like fish
The meat had a smell 
Expensive for what you get 

Pros
Lot of Parking
Hummus and bread was good 
Decor is beautiful"}
{"text":"We ordered the turkish tea (it was amazing), lahmacun, cigar rolls, eggplant and tomato sauce. For our mains we had several of the lamb courses.

It tasted very good, no complaints at all. The only complaint was the bathroom was super hot."}
{"text":"There are few times I have been so rarely disappointed in a restaurant.


The Manti was poorly executed. At a $17 price point it needs to be perfect. 
Thick dough, scarcely a wisp of ground lamb, topped with a watery, limp yogurt sauce that was deficient in spice and aromatics. 
The previous incarnation's (Anatalion Turkish Cuisine's) was much, much better.

The bread they brought out at the start had been made the day before. Perhaps even leftovers from the day before, that were hastily microwaved, and glazed with olive oil to give the appearance of fresh baked. Though it was far from fresh. 

The grilled meat platter was suspect. A small ramekin of rice was served. Plain white, Uncle Ben's rice mind you, and a second ramekin cost me $5. 
Literally a dollop of boiled white rice with a sprinkle of parsley for $5. 
That is tantamount to highway robbery in this particular restaurant Plaza.  
I felt violated. Almost to the point of calling 911 and saying I've just been robbed.

Lastly. $1.50 for Turkish tea is insulting. This is the only place I know who charges for it.

The ambience and layout is nice. It's a beautiful place. 
But it's only a matter of time until Pasha dies and goes to Restaurant Heaven.
The Downtown prices do not fit the East York Thornecliffe location. 
The service and product should befit the price, this is

If you're craving Turkish. Head elsewhere. Shirin, Pizza Pide, Mr Pide and Kebab 49 are all much, much better."}
{"text":"Toronto'da ya?ay?pta buraya gelmeyen Türk var m? bilmiyorum ama Türkiye'yi yemeklerle birlikte gezmek isteyen kesinlikle gelmeli. Te?ekkürler Pasha orijinal lezzetleri tatt?rd???n için..."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. We had special for 2 comes with lots of protein, and lastly Turkish coffee and desert. Lovely server"}
{"text":"The food was really good especially the eggplant salad and lahmacun (Turkish Pizza). The service wasn't really good."}
{"text":"Finally found a good Turkish restaurant in Toronto! The service was good and the food was delicious. I went with the family and together we ordered a number of items: spinach gets pide (perfect dough), mixed grill (great meats), and iskender kebab (yum!). For dessert, I would definitely recommend the kunefe over the baklava.

My only complaint is the exterior of the restaurant, it needs some renovation and doesn't reflect at all the great food inside!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. We went there for birthday celebration with the family. The food was really good and tasty. Our server was very friendly and the orders came in at the right time. The quality of the food and the quantity was amazing. The prices were reasonable. They serve great tea and Turkish coffee. No alcohol served though."}
{"text":"The only reason this restaurant gets any stars at all is because of the interior decorations/design. Really beautiful. 

Otherwise, the outdoors are horrible, dust, dirt, construction. 

The food is actually horrible, the meats were undercooked, the rice was unflavored. The food poorly reflected Turkish cuisine. And it's way over priced. 

If you thought that was bad, let's not even begin with the customer service here. Just horrible. They give zero shits about their customers and the waitress gets real sweet when it's time to pay the bill, other than that the staff is rude af the entire time and snarky. 

Will never be coming back."}
