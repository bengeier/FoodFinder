{"text":"Great pizza joint, a long time local hit for sure. Much better quality than pizza puzza or little caesars. Mom and pop shop. Also has reasonable other italien food options. They have an LLBO as well."}
{"text":"Love this place. Mom and pop pizza joint that is open late and passionate about providing a high quality slice or pizza. Just like stopping by Grandma's place..."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Palace Pizza for years now.. it was my go to place for lunch while in high school.  Now, 10 years later, I'm still greeted with a smile by Tula, one of the owners. She is very kind with her customers, remembering clients, asking how they are... thats just the \"service\" side of things. THE FOOD.. pizza, spaghetti, meatballs, garlic bread, ceased salad.. Its all amazing. The pizza is different and delicious, theres almost a sweetness to the sauce that I've yet to taste anywhere else. The hours are awesome.. want a slice of pizza at 2am on a Saturday night in the summer? Done. Finally.. the cost is great too. Eat in or take out, it's a great experience."}
{"text":"Just not good... You might as well cook spaghetti yourself and pour ragu sauce on it. Tomato sauce was overly sweet, and meatballs seemed processed and not very appetizing. Pizza wasn't very good either,  I wanted to like this place, as it is local and I read great reviews but was very disappointed.."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. This is the absolute best panzerotti my wife and I have ever had. The sauce is divine. The dough is flaky and delicious. The owners are super friendly and checked on us often to make sure we were completely happy. I strongly recommend that you give it a try."}
{"text":"Whenever we visit family in Newmarket, I always pass by this place and have always been meaning to try this place out, so last night I finally did.

Was craving for pizza, and I am surprised at how many pizza places there are in Newmarket, but I picked this one.

Walking in, the place is small, could seat up to 20 people, it appears to be a family-run business. The place is cozy and there is a TV showing the Leafs game. We were greeted and seated and was presented by a small menu of simple choices. You can have pasta, baked pasta, pizza or panzerotti. My BF got a build-your-own pizza which starts at 6 bucks (comes in 4 slices) and extra $ for each topping. I got a pepperoni slice for $3.50. 

It took about 15 minutes for food to arrive, and I was pleasantly surprised by the serving! The toppings made the pizza so thick! Even the $3.50 pizza slice is huge too, and it is not thin crust. Flavor was great, served hot and fresh, and very tasty.

Overall really good service and good value. Most of their customers do take out and delivery.

I would probably try the other pizza places in Newmarket just because there are so many other options, but yes I see myself going back to Palace Pizza if I am in the area to maybe try their panzerottis."}
{"text":"Got a pizza.... and it was good, if I remember correctly i've had a panzo from here and it was also good, its great dough so espically when its fried.... super yummy."}
{"text":"Very cozy inside, it's a nice mom and pop shop. They use good quality cheese and they don't skimp on it! Tried the baked ravioli and it was awesome! Loved it! Pizza looked great as well did the gnocchi. 
The sauce is homemade and you can tell. Every one that works there is super friendly, and I am looking forward to going back! 

Everyone should give this place a try! Such a nice find in Newmarket. It's good homemade comfort food for decent prices!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza, hands down. The BEST pizza I've ever consumed, period. I am proud to say this little nonna and nonno pizza shop is in Newmarket. Even during all the Davis Drive construction, I am always back with a smile. Their sauce has something different to it - maybe nutmeg or cardamom. The dough is cooked perfectly and, my favourite part, the cheese is laid ontop of the toppings, making it nice and golden brown.

I've had a few of their pizzas and am dying to try their spaghetti. I am not a spaghetti fan and I'm really looking forward to this. Will report back."}
