{"text":"Went there today around dinner time, the place is pretty packed.   We ordered mytho noodles, curry beef noodles and an avocado smoothie. The avocado drink came with no sugar, so it tasted really bland. Had to ask them to add some sugar into it. The food took a long time to come.   The mytho noodles soup base is good, but the seafood was tasteless. Curry beef noodles was way too spicy with very little beef. We also didn't get the sprouts and basil while others have it on their tables.   Overall, we probably won't be back in the near future."}
{"text":"I agree with most of the comments on this restaurant. I ordered a bbq pork vermicelli and the noodles were way over cooked. Also they didn't use the authentic thin vermicelli (they used the thick kind). I also ordered a young coconut on the hope that it'd be fresh but was left sorely disappointed. It tasted okay, but they didn't crack the top of well enough. I ended up picking pieces of coconut out like I was eating fish with bones. Overall would recommend for an average Viet meal, but don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant at 935 and was turned back by the staff. I was told the kitchen closed and they are not taking any new customers. However, this place says it closes at 10 pm. I was quite disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"I came back, but this time with my mom. The soup was still salty asf. While I was eating, I felt like my taste buds became numb and kind of hated me at the same time. Again, I dunked a shit load of hoisin sauce to cover the saltiness. My mom didn't like the fact that they never gave us napkins or beansprouts and the lemon until we asked. The beef in my mom's pho had a lot of fat! Usually, I would think that's a good thing but more than half the meat was fat. Realistically, I don't think I would want to eat that even though the fat is the yummy part. So, she just scooped it out. My beef was fine though. Anyways, I really dont think I'd come back. Not worth the price either. It was pretty busy though, so maybe other customers liked the place."}
{"text":"Not sure why all the bad reviews, food is decent.  The pho was really good, no complaint about the soup base.  It's just as flavourful as other good ones out there.  Portion is pretty big, good that I didn't order the large size bowl.  The spring rolls are good, really liked the little vermicelli side that came with the spring rolls.  This restaurant is plenty big and spacious.  Would definitely come back since it's so close to my house.  I think it's better than the Kennedy/Bur Oak one."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is extremely rude. To start off when I asked to separate the bill and explained which order I wanted on each bill, I was abruptly cut off and to make matters worse he messed up the billing."}
{"text":"Very busy on weekend evenings as the location is near a large residential area. Tables can be modified to suit large and small groups.  Satay beef noodles were huge and the broth was quite nice and spicy. However, in some other pho bowls, the rare beef seems overcooked.  Our group of 4 also shared the combination curry and roti. The roti was piping hot and very good portion to be shared as snacks.   With Pho Metro down the street, Le Viet may be a quick alternative if you need to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Gave them 2 chances cause I would love it to be my new go to pho place! The size of the pho bowls and noodles are good, but theres barely any meat! Broth is at times not hot... Not great for beam sprouts. Tried the bun bo hue and it was mediocre as well with not much noodles or meat...."}
{"text":"This was a relatively new Pho place that opened up in Markham. Their opening hours are very long often closing at 11 PM. We came here on a Saturday night around 6 PM and the restaurant was relatively quiet so service was quick and attentive. Think Le Viet as a fast-food type of Vietnamese restaurant so it's not so much of a sit-down \"leisurely enjoy your meal\" type.  Moving on to the food, I ordered Spring Roll BBQ Pork Vermicelli. The portions are huge but comes at a price ($10 or so). I found the beef way too oily as I was left with that gross oily lips feeling. The vermicelli is quite different from what I'm used to - it is slightly thicker with a milky base. It does compliment the meat but you don't realize how oily it can get. The fish sauce was also mediocre - the marination of the pickled carrots overcame the natural of fish sauce taste.   The pho comes in two sizes - medium and large. Large is pretty huge! It was decent but the soup base you can tell it was full of MSG. They offer cooked or raw bean sprouts which I found was different.   By the time we left (before 7 PM), the restaurant was packed. It's a good place for large groups of people - you can reserve ahead of time. I'm not sure if most people are coming by because it's new or if the foods that good.   Overall, it's a very fast food type of Vietnamese restaurant with too much oil. I wouldn't come back again even though the portions are big(ger)."}
{"text":"My family and I love coming here.  Maybe because its the only decent pho place close by but I happen to like their food alot. I don't expect service from pho places so I'm happy with the service that does exist.    Food is tasty but I'm sure there is msg or something in it.  The soup base is extremely salty.  I like salty, but I even I eat it and think 'I can't eat this too often'.   Portions are good.  The price point is a little more than regular pho places so their regular acts like a large and the large acts like an extra large."}
{"text":"Viet | Good portion | Debit or Cash  Nice big Vietnamese restaurant; same owner as Doh Heung. Lots of parking at the plaza.  When they first opened the quality was nothing special but after a while the food got better.   Good portion for the price you pay.   Would recommend if you're craving Vietnamese pho, bun, rice, hainanese chicken rice, Viet drip coffee etc"}
{"text":"It was nice to see a new place in this area, but the food was a bit disappointing. We had ordered a pho and a vermicelli. The vermicelli came with overcooked noodles, really soggy and ruined the entire dish. The pho was okay, soup didn't have much flavour though. Also left the place with a super dry mouth, food was clearly loaded with msg. This place has a few combos that come with hk style drinks, which is a nice change. I wonder if this place is ran by hk people? Service was okay, they did seem a bit overwhelmed with the Sunday crowd. Anyways unfortunately I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"Had the worst service ever! Came with some co workers and ordered the simplest thing on the menu ( roti). Everyone got their orders and even one of my coworkers with a green onion &egg roti got his food. I waited more than 45 min for a simple plain roti. Once it came, it was the wrong order. The server tried to blame it on me and said i ordered wrong. And when i showed the menu she knew she was wrong. Couldn't wait any longer and cancelled my order. From the one bite i took it tasted pretty good. Wish their service was better though. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Somehow I became a regular here at Le Viet for pho since there's a lack of Vietnamese options in the East Markham neighborhood.   The food and service had significantly improved from when they first opened. The place is always busy but without long wait time during peak lunch hours.   Their Pho was filling with generous amount of toppings. Decent beef slices, bouncy beef balls, hot and flavourful broth. Service was quick and efficient. Fried chicken was great but a bit pricey. Vermicelli was nice with a lot of toppings as well. Fish sauce was a little bit diluted for my taste.   This place has become my quick fix for pho.  **UPDATE** Their quality of their vermicelli has recently gone down. It's soggy and less spongy than it used to. I think either they have cooked the vermicelli for too long or forgot to rinse with cold water."}
{"text":"Honestly, just mediocre. One of the few pho locations in East Markham, it's not a terrible choice, but it most definitely isn't the best choice. Having ordered the house pho, the portion was pretty generous in terms of noodle, but not so much in the beef itself. I was pretty disappointed to find that the soup base wasn't flavourful; just really salty and oily, with a lack of any real beef flavour. The noodles were kinda clumped. As for the seafood soup with noodles; it just didn't have a lot of seafood? And the seafood that was there was pretty low grade and low quality. I was also really disappointed to find that they didn't serve rice wrap spring rolls; a staple to Vietnamese cuisine, in my humble opinion. Overall, there are far better pho places elsewhere."}
{"text":"New Vietnamese restaurant in East Markham.  Very expensive for Vietnamese food standards, anal portions as well!  The pho broth was very, very, very, very, very, very, very salty!!!!  The Hainanese Chicken and Rice was average.  The chicken was very tender, but not very flavorful and the rice was also not very flavorful.  It was cooked perfectly though, chewy rice!  Service was good and food arrived quickly."}
{"text":"Was so excited for a local pho place opening in the area.     We were greeted promptly and the guy assigning the tables was working very hard, and he was quick to pitch in, clean and get people seated.  Our appetizer was the fried spring roll.   For just under $6 it comes  a with some cold noodles with peanuts on top.  Spring roll itself might have been  a over cooked, it was a bit chewy.  Ordered my staple when trying a new pho place out.   Was quite expensive for a large special $10.50, but in all fairness it was a bit bigger than the usual large.   Meat quality is there and was tasty, but to me broth could have been a little better.   Didn't really get that flavour that a lot of pho soup bases have.    Lots of noodles came with the dish though.     Also tried the pork chop and chicken with rice.  Flavour of this was good, but the pork chop had a lot of fat on it (some may like that).  Service was fast and staff was attentive.    Because of how close it is, will definately try again, hopefully they just need some time to iron out the kinks."}
{"text":"This is so close to Markham Cornell Community. I was glad to see a new Vietnamese Cuisine business in the neighborhood. A place to give a try.  We came in for dinner on a weekday evening.    Service is acceptable. Ladies servers all are working with smile. Gentleman servers are very serious looking.  I feel the imbalanced vibe during my whole dining experience.   Okay, lets begin the food review.   Services 2 out of 5. There is no automatic water or tea refills. We had to ask .  The orders was taken and waiting time is reasonable. No complaint.  Food 2 out 5. Price and Food quality are not compatible.  They set a price at a higher than average and quality is so so.  We ordered one beef pho regular size and one tom yum noodle with shrimps and one fish cakes as appetizer.  There is other better tasteful Viet pho in Markham with lower price or the same price for more values.  Beef is very little and shrimps are smalls 6 pc. Noodle considered quite a small portion and taste is not impressive.    I will give it a chance in the future and it is quite new.  I would suggest the grand opening discount to impress the customers as if I was the owner.  Price apparently set higher than average.  Too bad there is no vegetarian options when we inquired about vegan dishes.   Not well fitting to the vegetarian population.   Hope they will consider the others who love Vietnamese food and also are Vegetarian"}
{"text":"Big space. Food was mediocre -  better soup bases elsewhere. However soup noodles are big portions. Chinese short woman waitress is rude."}
{"text":"Brand new pho place in the neighborhood. Hmmm....... My anticipation was very high for this place.  What a disappointment!   Tried the large P1 pho. Meat portions wasn't so much more compared to my friends regular size.  It's just a bigger bowl with a bit more noodles and soup.  Now comes the taste. Very salty and not much flavor. It did not satisfy my craving for the Vietnamese soup flavor. Not gonna try this again!!!    Satay skewers 3 chicken & 3 beef. $14.50 kinda pricey.  It's seasoning is kinda in the spicy side and very rich in flavor.  The peanut sauce had no peanut taste and more spicy then the actual meat. Not worth the money.   Service was ok. Nothing special.   My friend order the pork chop and chicken with rice.  They said it was pretty good but after they finished eating.  My friend's lips turned all red.  Good tell tale sound of MSG!    Not coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"This review is more of a 2.5 stars.   I really wanted to like this place because it's in the plaza so close to home and I thought I would finally be able to walk to get my pho craving satisfied. But sigh...no.   First off ever since this place opened up in the plaza the plaza has gotten A LOT busier which is good and bad in it's own way. There is still ample parking but I find getting into this plaza to grow more difficult because people are impatient and there are pedestrians crossing without looking.   Me and my boyfriend came here for Saturday Lunch around 1pm. When we enter there was a family ahead of us and the place was already packed. All tables full which is good to see for a new business. It didn't take long for a table. The manager speaks perfect English btw.   The staff was nice enough. Although the food did take longer than your average pho place but not the worst wait time. The place was definitely busy and the kitchen is probably still getting used to the pace. The manager even came over to talk to us about how busy it is all of a sudden.   The main reason this place isn't getting a 3 star and just a 2 star is because of the food. The noodles (I got the vermicelli) weren't properly cooked which is a real disappointment. They were undercooked. I had a chunk of noodles still stuck together and hard :( My boyfriend had the pho and he said the broth was really tasty but the noodles weren't up to par either.   The best part of the meal for sure was the coffee. They had the vietnamese style coffee where you pour the hot water through a steeper and the coffee drips into your cup. There was already cream/milk added into your cup prior. My boyfriend loved the coffee and I even have to admit the coffee tasted the best (I'm not a big coffee person in general)  I found the prices to be a bit higher than other places by like a $1.   Overall hopefully they improve because I would like to have a pho place I can walk to."}
{"text":"When reviewing I really try to look for the more than one star but alas this restaurant can only be given the one and it does not lie with the food.   The service was great and that's pretty much where it ends.   The restaurant appears to be a second location for a hotpot restaurant that doubles as a Pho restaurant during the day. It's the second location to Kim Tao Hot Pot.   The lunch I had felt like leftover hot pot food in noodle soup.   Hubby and I both ordered the \"rare\" beef pho. However when the food arrived the beef was all cooked and not like all cooked cause the soup was too hot, but looked like and tasted like it had been precooked and then thrown into the bowl.  So my rare was more like a well well over done.   The portions appear to be hit and miss. We both ordered the regular size and I saw someone at the table next to us order the same. I could barely see the noodles in ours.   The most important part of a good pho is the soup base. This was more like hot water flavoured with some bouillon flavour cubes.  The rice dishes look plentiful so perhaps it really hit and miss?"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food has been consistently \"meh\". It ain't bad but it ain't great. Serving staff are usually pretty nice there, but lady behind the counter taking debit payments is a bit of a grouch.   Today we ordered takeout and I took a bite of the pork from my pork and spring roll vermicelli lunch special ($8.99 with a drink), and found that it was still raw. Not a fun find. Pretty gross, but I'll probably keep going back to eat my food cautiously because there aren't many other bearable Asian restaurants around here."}
{"text":"Environment 2/5  Poorly insulated and very echoey. Seats are uncomfortable and tables were greasy-feeling.  The environment felt like an Asian food court with high ceilings and an annoying sound for the door opening / closing.   Also, the handicap button is malfunctioning entrance and exiting.   Customer service 1/5  Customer service is pretty much non-existent. Waitress just carelessly plates it onto the table and walks away. Doesn't plate in front of the customer, which I made eye contact and indicated it was mine.  She didn't care and just put it in the center of table.   No hello and bye. Just write what you want to order in a piece of paper and no refill on the cheap powder tea.   It should also be noted that the staff are Chinese who are running a Vietnamese restaurant.  I would recommend these staff check out an authentically run Viet place and try their noodles.   Food quality 2/5  I ordered the seafood Tom yum ($10.95) which I would NOT recommend. All of the seafood items (e.g. 3 Mussels, 2 over-cooked shrimps, ripened fake crap meat, etc.) tasted \"off.\"  I refused to eat any of the seafood pieces because it was terrible. The rice noodle was also overcooked and mushy.   The only part that fine was the tom yum soup base.  It tasted great and had the heat spicy/sour in balance perfectly.   Price 3/5  For Viet food (runs by Chinese people), you'd expect it to be affordable but nope. Everything was at least $8+ including the appetizers.  Portions for my tom yum was generous.  The price for just consuming the overcooked and soup base is not worth $10.95.  The food prices may also reflect the expensive lease as this plaza is very bare.  Only this restaurant, veterinarian, Petsmart, Food Basics and Dollarama exist on this strip.  The other lots remain empty.  Overall 1/5  I've been living in this area since the first houses were built on Bur Oak.  Believe it or not, back then the townhouses were only going for $250k now it's over $600k. *o*    It's pathetic that this area has no decent Asian food (thank god there's finally a cha-time!) considering the majority of the residents are Asian.  This is one of the few Asian restaurants in the area (closest is Canteen to which I got food poisoned), the rest are franchised fast food (e.g. Popeyes - terrible and Subway).    Since I have a car, I'll drive somwhere else to get my Viet-cravings, therefore, I will never be coming back here!  The reviewers here are honest across the board.  I would not recommend this place for Viet cuisine, there are others across York Region that has a longer establishment with fresher ingredients! ^_~  Side note:  Perhaps this lot is curse?  Originally this location was a bagel place that claimed to be the \"best\" bagel on the world, they evidently haven't had bagels in Montreal.  From what I recall during opening month, the bagels tasted like Tim Horton's bagels with a premium price. It closed down quickly which was no surprise."}
{"text":"Surprised this place has such low ratings cause I thought the food was pretty good! Grabbed a lemon grass chicken for takeout for $9.50 and it was awesome. Huge chicken portion and nice garnishes on the side. They were very fast to make it as well. From what I saw on the inside, it looked pretty clean (considering it's new) it's just that the lights made the place look kind of dark. Will definitely come back to try their pho next time!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurant recently.   Their food is excellent and service is good too.  In fact, there's nothing taste bad.  Totally recommend to everyone!!"}
{"text":"2.5, i believe they just opened this joint recently. Spacious parking and space In the restaurant and barely any line ups which is great. We tried the grilled lemongrass chicken with rice which I thought was decent however way too greasy. Also, we tried the vermicelli dish with spring rolls, bbq beef and shrimp on sugarcane. I found the dish to be ok, the beef was over over cooked and very oily. Spring rolls and shrimp was nothing special, have tasted better elsewhere.   Generous portions however you do pay the price for it."}
{"text":"I'm kind of surprised at the low ratings here, because I thought this was an okay place to eat at. My very first time here was when they first opened, and there were tons of people waiting for seats. I would say their system for who came first isn't too great, but there was only one host and they seemed to remember who was the first one here, so it all worked out.  Le Viet is a rather large pho shop, with cubbies on the side and regular tables in the middle. We got their special beef rice noodle soup ($8.95 for the regular), ($10.95 for the large). Their noodles aren't too soggy, and their portions are huge! The soup was fairly hot throughout.  We also got their Hainan Rice Chicken, ($10.50). The chicken was really smooth and juicy, the portion of the rice was large and tasty with ginger. I really enjoyed it.   We also got their drip coffee, I am not a coffee drinker at all, so I can't tell you about this option."}
{"text":"Horrible food at this newly open restaurant. I was initially excited that a new restaurant open up in the area, been here twice and not impressed at all. Their rare beef pho, beef was overcooked, the mun red ben with coconut juice and jello drink had no coconut taste and was super bland. Pork vermicelli, pork was very dry. Food was slow to come out and we had to remind them for dine in.   Got take out today and not impressed at all, gave their drink another try but the red beans aren't even cooked, super hard and the take out vermicelli they didn't even pack us a fish sauce which we didn't realize till we got home.   Super disappointed will not be back any time soon:( The one star is for the service as the servers were pretty polite."}
{"text":"Salty. Salty. Salty!  Portions are fairly big. A regular sized bowl was enough for 2 people! We ordered the rare beef pho and it was like licking a salt lick! We also ordered a vermicelli dish and that was ok.  Might have been an off day, but be aware.. salt bomb!"}
{"text":"Service is bad . Haven't even try the food yet cause I place the order in and waited 30 min and we found out they forgot our order . They didn't even apologize so we decided go somewhere  else...Won't  come back again ."}
{"text":"My family's go to pho place.  Although pricier than most pho places, Portions are big.    Enjoy their curry beef brisket with roti, but have to say, the roti portion was larger before.  As well, the Hanan chicken, they use to give 2 different types of ginger dipping sauce.  Now only provide the traditional ginger sauce, would have liked both.    Wasn't too happy with the avocado shake, not enough avocado.  Overall, still recommend Le Viet!"}
{"text":"New viet place on the block, so like we all do let's go and try it out...and as expected, the line was super long...but thankfully we didn't wait that long...i think like 10 mins..everything is still very new, i think the owner is probably a newbie business owner becuz he was being cocky to the clients' and didn't appeared like he cared too much....so for a first timer, at any pho restaurant, i always order the original pho, the soup broth is the bread and butter of any pho restaurant...and the viet spring rolls....  So in all fairness, the soup broth was pretty tasty and it was very hot when it came out...the bowl was fairly big but the noodles and beef tripe was quite limited, I ordered the \"special\" which didn't really make me feel like it was a special...for $9.50, a hot drink was included...add $1 extra for a cold drink..  The spring rolls were not that great, yes there was overcooked vermicelli/mixian on the side but it was severely overcooked with thick cucumber sticks...I did not enjoy the spring rolls as it was pure meat inside...pork likely....  2/5 for the service  3/5 for the food  All in all, if I had to compare this place to my usual, Kim Dinh, I would still go to Kim Dinh personally..."}
{"text":"Came here first time to try Bun Bo Hue (N10 on menu) and Pho Dac Biet (P1 on menu).   Do not come here for Bun Bo Hue. $8.95. It tasted like a Tom Yum soup base. When asked, the manager/owner responded with \"different places cook differently.\"  Not impressed with that kind of response for a quite unique dish as Bun Bo Hue.  Pho was $8.50 for regular size, it came with sufficient portion of noodles, beef and other typical stuff. Flavour was a bit lacking but the beef quality was good."}
{"text":"Pho here is not good, pricey, and small portions. Mostly noodles and not much meat even for Large size at $11-12 per bowl. We ordered Pho with beef & meat balls (Pho Tai Bo Vien). We also ordred Vermecelli with meat (Bun Thich Nuong), it was also mediocre and not that great. Overall the Vietnamese food here is very mediocre and not authentic, seems like Chinese people just copy & try to make Vietnamese food. Pho Tai Bac in Richmond Hill is much better, cheaper, better portions and more authentic. Pho Tai Bac is actually own by a Vietnamese owner who used to own Pho Con Bo at Jane & Wilson before.  We would not order any food from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"everyone giving this 3 stars and I'd have to agree. not the best I've ever had but certainly not the worst and for North Markham, an area that's developing a ton of retail and dining this is a great spot for a quick Vietnamese food fix.  looks and smells like a pho restaurant and has the options of one. can't complain on that.  food tasted fairly good. my house special regular was actually quite big and is a big medium or just smaller large at most places.  fresh tasting broth though a smidge saltier than I hoped for.  Also it's not a Vietnamese run place completely as there is a little of Chinese staff as well but no impact on final product. for what you're ordering it's nice, warming and a good option for take out or quick dine in. kinda looks like a middle eastern place in a way with the set up but all in all a decent place.  would come back. 3.5 out of 5.0  ah quick note, cash and debit only. heads up if you usually pay credit or want points"}
{"text":"A decent restaurant serving Vietnamese food. I wouldn't say it's the greatest, but it's one of the only ones in the area. If you have a craving for Vietnamese food and don't want to drive too far, this place will satisfy it.   The pho broth is alright, though I prefer mine to have more flavour. The rare beef in the pho arrives nearly completely cooked already, but this seems to be a recurring issue at most pho places. Everything else is ok.   I did like their Vietnamese coffee. It comes drip-style which is fun, but then you have to wait a while to have your drink. I had mine hot, so it was fine, but my brother had his over ice and that was a little awkward to balance.   The place does get pretty busy during meal times, so go at off-peak times, or be prepared to wait a bit for a table.   I would probably come again the next time I have a pho craving."}
{"text":"The overall of the dining experience was great. Two servers welcomed my family with one toddler and one baby. One opened the door for me when I was carrying a car seat and two servers set up highchair and took the order.  Food portion size  was best around Markham area with same price . I like the flavour of pho and other dishes other than pho . Grill chicken / grill pork were juicy and not overcooked . Not sure why the rating was low about this restaurant. Maybe it is not authentic? ( but I do love the flavour of all the food I tried there ) Not many restaurant serve good portion with a reasonable price like that, and serve juicy and flavourful grill meat. Service was great and I am satisfied with overall experience.  My whole family likes the place Everytime we visit."}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 stars for this restaurant. I'm a bit puzzled why the ratings are so low... but I'm a regular customer at this little location up in East Markham. They have really good food here! I know a lot of friends who live around the area that all come here to eat regularly. My hubby and I come in almost once every 1-2 weeks for some decent Viet food. My family (including my brother who actually lives out in Oakville) - we come here from time to time for lunch/dinner!   There are a few things I almost always order:  1. Pho. The broth is more light for the Pho, but it's not too salty and I actually really like that. Noodle portions are generous and often times I have trouble finishing it!   2. Vermicelli. Their vermicelli is also really good. I know it's a little weird that their noodles are a bit warm but I actually don't mind that - that way the noodles are a bit softer too when I eat with the spring rolls and the minced pork - which is seasoned nicely.   3. Curry Chicken/Beef Brisket. I love their curry. It is amazing!! the beef brisket is always nice and tender, and it comes with a side order of rice or you can upgrade for a few dollars and get their roti.  I haven't tried the pita yet but it's a bit frustrating that i have to pay an extra 3-4 dollars just for it... but eventually I think i'll give it a try!  If you get their lunch special, which is the beef brisket one, you can also get a coffee/tea or pay 75 cents to upgrade to a Viet coffee. Their Viet coffee is legit - I love it. Best part? They give you your own little squeeze bottle of condensed milk so you can adjust the sweetness to your own liking!!!! They also give you a jug of hot water so you can rebrew a second cup... and I love these guys for that :)  Portions are always very generous we always end up packing food to go! So for the price point I think it's great! We came on a Sunday lunch recently, and the traffic at the restaurant was busy! They serve you very quickly, and food usually comes out within 10 mins. There was a line up by the time I left the restaurant so people definitely like this place!"}
{"text":"Overall, not the worst place but definitely only worth it if you are in the area. The flavour isn't amazing in the broth (ordered the special pho), and the meat isn't that great. Even the siracha and hoisin sauce tasted a little off. However, it was still satisfactory for a bowl of pho.  Prices are decent, have seen better at locations in Scarborough. The food comes quickly, but the servers aren't that great. Not responsive and at times rude."}
{"text":"You pay extra for takeout containers. The cost of containers should be priced into the food cost. Food portions are large though."}
{"text":"I was excited to see this open in my neighborhood, but after a few visits, I'm just not impressed. It's pricey for the portions, and everything is extremely MSG-laden. It's still quite busy during weekends, I suspect more to do with the lack of choices in the area than the quality of its food."}
{"text":"A convenient place to go to for Vietnamese food.   Ordered their house special (11$) and the curry chicken roti (14$). They forgot to give us tea/water, but that's okay.   They have friendly waiters/waitress. Food comes quick but is mediocre (soup base is saltier than other places). Their curry chicken roti is one of my favourites (the roti is sweet). Their portion is really big too!  The place is big and have lots of parking spaces."}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 stars. Don't know why people gave it poor reviews. We came here on a weekday and were served immediately. We asked about peanut allergies and they actually have a printed statement on their menu to let them know about allergies so that they can accommodate you. Staff were attentive the whole time.  We have visited many pho places and I like this place. We usually order the same two dishes wherever we go. The flavour is very good, the portions are generous. Pricing is typical but very good value - lots of toppings!  It is true that their soup is a bit on the richer/fattier side, but it didn't hold me back from finishing the bowl. I will be back! Next time I might try the curry with roti.   Oh, I noticed that they do have high chairs for kids, but the washrooms are single rooms without a change table, for the interested parents.   And yes, they charge for takeout containers...I think it's good for the environment. We should try to use less plastic and foam."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Vietnamese restaurant. I usually order stewed beef with tomato soup and rice noodle. Surprised it came out as quick as it did as usually my order takes longer to clone it than everyone else's. Also ordered an avocado shake. Noodles were good, but avocado shake was a bit more icy than I prefer."}
{"text":"I was ordering a lemon grass pork chop rice for take out, the waiter who took my order asked me \"that's it??\" At least 4 times, I asked him if he wants me to order more, and he said: \" of course we want to have bigger order\""}
{"text":"very limited pho options. the beef pho has 4 slices of beef. the soup base is your regular MSG Vietnamese pho soup that can be bought in the supermarket. i can make my own bowl of pho for a dollar instead of paying 10 in this place"}
{"text":"Le Viet Asian Cuisine seems to be the neighbourhood's favourite Vietnamese restaurants. Maybe just the lack of other options, everyone are dropping by for their Pho fix!  I could not argue the price is decent, the portion is huge!!   A regular Pho ($8.50) equal to a large in other restaurants, I could not even imagine how big is their large here.  MSG alert though for the broth.  I also tried the Tomato Beef Brisket with Rice and Grilled Meat/Spring Roll with Vermicelli. All under $10 and the portion is generous.  I won't go out of my way to come to Le Viet but if you live close by or in the area, it is worth a visit. Just don't expect to have authentic Vietnamese food, but more like a version that make Chinese people happy.   Service is fast and efficient. The staff here is quite friendly."}
{"text":"Came here cause our friend noticed a new pho joint and we were in the area. No expectations, but it wasn't good from the get-go. The signage, banners, and grand opening flags just scream Chinese owned, and sure enough it is. Actually, you can recognize the servers from other HK restaurants in the past.  With that said, I guess they're not lying. It's called Le Viet \"Asian cuisine\" not \"Viet cuisine\" so don't expect anything remotely authentic. Luckily, I had curry brisket, which was standard HK style. It wasn't terrible, but my buddy's pho was quite sub par. They use ho fun, not the dry noodles, and the broth was a really bland, msg-laden,  flavourless solution. No garnishes were provided whatsoever. I guess you don't go to Panda Express or Manchu Wok for Chinese, so don't come here looking for pho. What you'll get is some Canto pseudo-pho that'll leave you thoroughly unsatisfied. Should've named the place Pho-ny Viet lol, it's not cheap either, so if you have any culinary self-respect, save yourself the disappointment and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I wouldn't suggest going at any busy time, terrible service. They are very unorganized while waiting in line, no number was given. They would just ask who came first. As we were waiting for about 20 minutes we realized the waiters/waitress giving the wrong dishes to the wrong tables. They were also walking around a lot but they weren't doing anything. People were waving their hands for the bill/water but they would just walk right past them.   I ordered the beef brisket pho, came out in about 10 minutes. The portion of a large is tiny and only two pieces of beef brisket; although the soup wasn't bad. A friend of mine ordered one of the cold noodle dishes which took 36 minutes to come out, I finished my dish and she was still waiting. But the portion was fair.   Nothing special, wouldn't recommend unless there's nothing else to eat."}
{"text":"We came to try this place out. Didn't have any expectation considering the negative and low review for this place. We ordered a com, bun and a bowl of pho.  The grilled meats were alright. Chicken was way too dry. The lemongrass pork was well flavoured. The bun was too oily, probably from the spring roll that they put in. The noodle bowl had a few pieces of meat. Nothing special.  There's alot better places for Vietnamese food. But if I was in the area and super hungry, maybe id come back.  $3.50 for extra meat, $2 for extra noodles."}
