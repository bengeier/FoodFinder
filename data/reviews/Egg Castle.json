{"text":"Ah, Egg Castle, you still make me laugh.  I've been eating here since my feet couldn't touch the ground while sitting in the booths.  The food is what you'd expect from a diner and I still visit there because I know I can count on the quality.  As for the patrons, well, most of the people eating at Egg Castle were already retired by the time of the Great Depression, so it wasn't such a hardship for them.  I kid.  But seriously, it's grandparents central.  Like walking into my synagogue except there's a better turn out at the Egg Castle.  \"Dear, more kawfee please.\""}
{"text":"Great traditional restaurant/diner, best known for its breakfast.  The options are limited in West Akron but regardless, Egg Castle would be one of my favs nonetheless."}
{"text":"There's absolutely nothing wrong with getting old.  It has its charms.  It has its perks.  One of which is The Castle.  Don't get me wrong:  you don't have to be older than polyester to enjoy the Egg Castle.  I've been there when some young buck born during the Truman Administration shuffles in for \"the usual,\" one egg, soft toast, double Metamucil, water back.  He's all cocky, eyeing the blue-haired babes, whistling that new Harry James tune.  Still, he's not the bedrock upon which The Castle is built.  No, the true worth of Egg is reliability.  You'll sit in the same booth every time.  You'll revel in \"Akron's Best\" eggs Benedict, sopping up the remaining egg with your perfect toast.  And you'll get Madge, who has been serving here since it was The Egg Castle, then The Vineyard, and now the Egg Castle yet again.  Imagine The Castle in black and white.  Trevor Howard and Orson Welles are in the next booth, going over their lines for \"The Third Man,\" waiting for latkas, and you'll be right on the money.  Fancy?  Nahh.  Memorable?  I'm not sure.  Steady?  Yeah.  Steady.  Just bring me the breakfast, let me stare out the window, imagining a time \"when things could grow, and days flowed quietly; the air was clean, and you could see; and folks were nice to you.\""}
{"text":"We make a habit out of stopping at Egg Castle every summer on our way down to the WGC-Bridgestone Golf Tournament. The place doesn't do anything particularly well but nothing is bad either. We go for breakfast and it doesn't cost much. It's the kind of place where nobody even looks up when a waitress yells across the room, \"Hey! The toilet's blocked up in the men's room again. Get Joe in there with the plunger...\"  You don't really know Akron unless you eat some over easy eggs with white toast at this place early early in the morning."}
