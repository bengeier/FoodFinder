{"text":"They were at the Payson food truck festival on Aug 5, 2017. Three stars is generous. I would love to see them succeed so here are my suggestions. Do not toast the bread with heavy oil on it, but use a high quality rye with you sauce lightly applied to the rye. My sandwich was covered with sauce squirted out from a bottle. Way too much... Could not taste the corned beef!  Also use a quality New York Kosher corned beef. My fries were not cooked enough... At all. Ugh! Try using a thinner fry which will cook faster and check your fryer temp. The pickle \"discs\" you use are discusting... Use a Kosher spear. My sandwich was $13. Offer a Rueben? You have to have stand out food to get the prices food trucks charge."}
{"text":"I had the fully loaded brisket fries and the wings. The brisket was so tender and full of flavor. The wings are good size wings with this amazing crispy coating. Omg I'm still daydreaming about the crunch. Lol I can't wait to visit this truck again and taste something else delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible.  Took 25 mins to get my sandwich which consisted of 10 little diced pieces of meat and a mushy mess of onions and bell peppers which I asked them to leave off but was told \"no custom orders\".  Terrible flavor and consistency.  Don't try it not even once."}
{"text":"I'm trying not to award one stars but honest to GOD this was as horrible as it gets. We tried the  sample buckeye rolls and ordered two corned beef rolls and one steak roll. I tried the one corned beef roll. It was covered in a mix of shredded cheese that doesn't melt that I scrapped off. It was very greasy and a weird funky color. It tasted like very old sour oil. There were remains of crisp corned beef fragments in the roll but their flavor didn't make it over the overwhelming fowl grease taste. This was the WORST THING I STUCK IN MY MOUTH this year.

My husband tried the steak roll and he said it was bad in a different way......

We were suppose to have another corned beef roll but they gave us something unidentifiable light color meat that wasn't on the menu.

I didn't mention this before but we waited and extremely long time for our order. There was a man before us that was waiting longer than us and he left without his food or his money back. The people at the food truck asked us if we wanted his food. Of course we declined.

It would have been better for us if we did the same as that man before us.

People that make food this bad shouldn't have a food license."}
{"text":"Great food! Fast and tasty. I found them at a booth in pine & are moving to payson here soon! Owners were very nice! The Fries are a must get as well"}
{"text":"The Cleveland Corned Beef Company brought their food truck out to my place of work today, there were many e-mail reminders and a few people talking about the food, all positive.  I checked the reviews online and found only a few negative so I decided to give it a try. My boss was kind and gave me a punch card that bought me a sandwich too!  OMG... so good!

The owner was standing outside taking orders and being friendly also which is different than most food place experiences.  She is so pleasant to talk with, she asks questions that indicate she has an interest in you, not just your money you leave in exchange for the food.  Onto the food; I ordered the \"Big Cleveland\" Meal since they were offering a special on it.  It comes in a large paper like container with a generous helping of fries.  The sandwich itself is huge, more than enough. In fact I could not finish it. I kept telling myself I should stop eating halfway through but kept taking little bites. About ¾ of the way through I finally had to stop.  I am little I admit but this sandwich is still more than enough for one person of any size.  The two meats were juicy, thinly and perfectly sliced, the veggies were not mushy either!  Cheese was melted perfectly.  The sauce...YUM and the perfect amount.  One other thing, that card I mentioned my boss gave me?  It is good for a sandwich, however the whole meal was given at no extra charge when I told her I could pay the difference.  Customer service is over the top!  Hopefully the pictures I took at my desk while salivating show just how much you will enjoy this sandwich!  I used a ruler in one of the shots for those of you who like that kind of info or who have doubts as to how much food you will get for the price you will pay, it's worth it and I don't say that often"}
{"text":"We had to try it because the smell was absolutely amazing. It was the best looking food truck at the Balloon Classic. I was amazed at the items they offered. They let us sample the meat before ordering which was great-the meat just melted in your mouth. We settled on the corn beef fries and were not disappointed. My boyfriend, son, and myself all wanted more!"}
{"text":"So tonight I saw their food truck and decided to give them a try.  I paid $12 for a corned beef sandwich with french fries and a 2 oz. solo cup of sopping, soggy cole slaw.   I was shocked when I saw the sandwich.  First of all, the rye bread was totally soggy, almost wet.  But then the kicker was the corned beef.  I mean if corned beef is in the name of your business, shouldn't it be to die for?  NOT!!  It was over brined and salted, but the worst part was that there was so little of it.  Well, actually maybe that was a good thing in this case, but talk about feeling ripped off.  There was probably less than 3 oz. of meat and there was not one decent slice of it.  It was all like crumbs and leftovers and shaved so thin, it was see through.  I was appalled.  If you want a real deli sandwich, try Goldman's Deli where the meat is packed so high it doesn't fit in your mouth, and where the taste is perfect, the salt ratio is perfect and the slices are nice and substantial.  And it's probably less than $12 and at least 4 times the amount of meat.  The only reason I gave The Cleveland Corned Beef Company 2 stars, is because they do make homemade french fries.  They were not great, they were undercooked and limp, but at least they weren't frozen.  Oh yeah, and the lady serving at the counter is rather snippy too, which didn't help."}
{"text":"So I was really excited to go to the food truck festival that was held at Parke West in Jan 2017. This food truck was my first stop. From the pictures and descriptions on the board I thought I was gonna be in for a decent sandwich. Boy was I wrong. I ordered the Euclid which was a corned beef sandwich \"piled high\" on rye bread with a butter sauce which felt odd but whatever. One look at the sandwich I received and I was instantly disappointed. What happened to \"piled high\" like on the menu?? What I received was a thin sandwich and some sad looking soggy fries. Corned beef wasn't all that great either and far from self-proclaimed \"best corned beef sandwich in Arizona\". Store bought corned beef and rye bread straight out of a bag. Definitely not worth the money. Also, they couldn't have even cut the sandwich in half as shown on the menu. Pure laziness. There are plenty of good sandwich options out there in this town and the Cleveland Corned Beef Company is one to stay far away from."}
