{"text":"I would give this place five stars for the food if it didn't take 1.5 hours for it to reach me.  Service is seriously slow, and honestly a little whack, \"uh, yeah I would like you to clear the dirty dishes off the one empty table that I just sat down at\"...ten minutes later... \"Seriously, could you please clear the dishes and bring some menus, you know, when you feel like it\".  Eventually dishes are cleared but we sit without menus for another good fifteen minutes before again asking for them. When they finally arrive we have all but thirty seconds to make our selections, lest we never see our server again.  All that aside, I can forgive slow and erratic service so long as it's genuinely friendly (and here it is), it just limits the appeal of a place that would otherwise be perfect for a workday lunch.  With the current level of service there is no way you're getting in and out fast enough to make it back to your office within an hour.  But otherwise, if you have time at your leisure and perhaps a date to impress, this is a good shot.  You can even use the (lack of) service to fill gaps in conversation, not that you'd have any ;-) The ambiance is warm, beautiful and inviting, with a little side patio to enjoy after checking out the rotating gallery inside.  The crepes are a must. Savoury. Sweet. Buckwheat! You can't lose on this one.  They have great tea blends served in cute little pots with wooden spoons and homemade truffles just to make things extra special.    Pretty little spot to liiiiinnnnnggeeerrrrr.  Come here with a delightful companion to soak up the atmosphere and lovingly prepared food."}
{"text":"This is a fairly expensive creperie due to the high quality ingredients they use and I suspect also due to the over staffing. They seem to have a lot of people working there, but they are all really busy. They had almost no customers when I went there but the service was still rushed and hard to come by. The wifi didn't work when I tried it, but it was broadcasting. They need to get a little more organized and make customer service more of a priority. The sweet crepe I had was decent, but overpriced."}
{"text":"Read the negative reviews on this place ... then eat elsewhere. It's really a shame this place is so mismanaged. The concept (art cafe) and location are good ... the food and service are horrendous. My husband and I ordered chocolate croissants and coffee. We waited for 15 minutes while the owner and an employee yelled at each other behind the counter (in another language, so I cannot say what the argument was about). When we were finally served. we discovered that our croissants had clearly been sliced with a knife used to cut onions. Nothing like onion-flavoured chocolate (it's actually Nutella) to start your day. Although we both ordered coffees, we were each served with cups that were different styles and different sizes. We had to go to the counter to ask for spoons and sugar. The server had a real attitude even though we were nothing but polite to her. Perhaps she was still reeling from the public scolding she had received from that scary boss-lady. We had heard similar stories from other patrons, but we figured we'd give the place a try. This cafe is amateur hour. What a waste. We definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here this morn, excellent food! That art work on the walls was a lot of fun too"}
{"text":"The food and beverages are really not great (3 star) but I like the location and atmosphere so much (warm friendly gallery cafe behind a cheesy storefront on Dundas) that I often stop here for a tea when passing by."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times. Their crepes are always good. Love having the hot milk with my coffee."}
{"text":"I've ordered the dark chocolate chicken crepe to go a long time ago. I remember thinking it would be interesting but it turned out tasting terrible and was paired with a weird salad and I never wanted to go there again. I also remember having to wait a long time to get my order and it wasn't busy at the time either. However, a friend wanted to try crepes and asked my to an early lunch so I decided to try again. This time I ordered the brie and jam crepe which was pleasant and a good breakfast-y option. And the third time I went was with a large group. we took up half the space but we also got to try more flavours as everyone sampled each other's orders. I got the very berry which was nice but not really memorable. We also ordered the crepe suzette which was also not very spectacular. Coupled with the limited options, high price point, and long wait, I wouldn't recommend this place for crepes when you can get better ones at cafe crepe on queen street instead."}
{"text":"Friendly service and tasty coffee. Music was a bit loud for a Saturday afternoon but I did enjoy the art vibe atmosphere."}
{"text":"Regularly recommend this place. Love their savoury crepes and the pistachio/chocolate crepe is divine!"}
{"text":"Their specialty is crepes and hand made chocolates - very good truffles.   Great Turkish and regular organic coffee.  Probably tied with Coffee Tree for my favorite coffee in Toronto. It is not your cookie-cutter cafe.  It is visually pleasing -  surrounded by art by talented local artists.  The place has a nice vibe.  The staff is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they opened in 2005. I remember speaking to the owner on my first visit back then. She was very energetic and excited about this cafe. Since then I've been a royal customer of art square cafe. I used to live around the corner and frequented there. After being absent from Toronto for a couple of years, I recently returned to this cafe with some nostalgia. I am not sure if it is me who changed, but the taste of profiteroles and hot chocolate seemed different. Did the owner change? What happened to that thick and aromatic real chocolate? I was absolutely disappointed with the soggy light taste profiteroles and the flat hot chocolate. It feels just like meeting an old friend after a long time and realize that she has changed, no longer clicking each other...sad :("}
{"text":"The ambience is nice - nice decor and small cute gallery. Crepes however awful - I got the one with egg/mozzarella and there was barely any in the crepe. I thought they had forgotten the filling but turns out there just wasn't much (could barely taste it). If you're looking for a crepe there are other places in Toronto that are better. Coffee was fine."}
{"text":"I like the art on the walls and the cafe is also liquor licensed. I like the design very much. I haven't tried their crepes or their omelettes yet. We just came back from the AGO. I originally wanted to have a coffee at Cafe AGO, but it was too crowded. This is the next best thing to Cafe AGO."}
{"text":"As a fan of weekend brunch, I'm surprised I haven't heard of or visited this place earlier.  And it's been there for years!  It's located across the street from AGO, near Chinatown, away from the trendiest brunch neighbourhoods, and perhaps somewhat confusingly paired up with an art gallery.  You might not expect great food in an art gallery, but here you'll be pleasantly surprised.  The menu consists mostly of  a variety of savoury and sweet crepes (your choice of wheat or buckwheat).   The crepes are soft, unlike those you'd find on any corner in Paris.  (The owners are Turkish, I believe.)  The savoury crepes are covered in a thin layer of  red, green or spicy chocolate sauce before being folded and topped with the main ingredient.   The smoked salmon and goat cheese crepe, for example, comes with the green, herb-flavoured filling and is accompanied by a nice salad.  If you don't feel like a crepe, ask for zucchini pancakes, served with a cucumber-yogurt dipping sauce.  Flavourful, but on a soft side, without crispness you'd expect from fried vegetable pancakes.   I heartily recommend a very refreshing mint-and-lime drink. They also offer a large selection of teas, including yerba mate and other caffeine-free options.   One day, I'll have to try a shot of authentic Turkish raki (a strong anise-flavoured liquor).    For dessert, in addition to big portions of  tiramisu, the cafe offers a selection of delicious home-made chocolate truffles and Turkish delight.    It's worth mentioning that the place has the most adorable and coziest patio I've seen in Toronto.  Surrounded by tall brick walls on all sides, it's a little sanctuary of calm.   It can accommodate three tables only, and you need luck to find one that's free."}
{"text":"To Leyla the owner that has a problem with honesty:  Leyla, are you serious?  Somebody that says your food is good is out to hurt the business? How about admitting the fact that you steal credit card numbers?   I know business is tough, but screwing a customer is not going to fly by. I was in Toronto for less than a week and you kept charging me once every month until I disputed with the bank.  My bank refunded me for your fraudulent charges. But arguing with a scammer is a waste of breath.  06/01/2012  PURCHASE MADE ON 05/31/12 AT ART SQUARE GALLERY AND TORONTO CD $4.97 07/16/2012  PURCHASE MADE ON 07/13/12 AT ART SQUARE GALLERY AND TORONTO CD $4 07/18/2012  FINAL CREDIT FOR PURCHAS MADE ON 7/13 AT ART SQUARE CALLERY   $4.00 07/18/2012  FINAL CREDIT FOR PURCHAS MADE ON 5/31 AT ART SQUARE CALLERY   $4.97  There is your proof. I'll give you a number to call for HSBC. I'm sure they'd love to hear from someone who steals.  Any decent customer service rep would offer an apology first before trying to blame the customer."}
{"text":"I found the food at this cafe to be very good and the atmosphere superb. I especially enjoy the cozy enclosed patio area.  My only qualm with the establishment is the service. The waitress (who was obviously not fluent in English) brought us the wrong drinks on more than one occasion and had a generally hard time taking our orders.  I got the chocolate and pistachio crepe with the pomegranate and blueberry juice with vodka and ice, but it was lacking the vodka the first time around.  I probably won't revisit this restaurant because of the service."}
{"text":"Their Siege of Art (a café mocha with cocoa magic) is amazeballs, as are their 4-for-$5 truffles. The chocolate-orange 'Nelson Mandela' is especially gorgeous."}
{"text":"Food not great and service wasn't all that good either. I ordered a caffe latte and had to ask for a spoon, napkins and sugar."}
{"text":"I'm tempted to write a single word review \"YUM!\" - it sums it up so succinctly.   A friend introduced me to Art Square last weekend, and I couldn't believe that I had never been inside. I don't know why, but I stopped paying attention to the strip of bars, lounges, galleries, and restaurants near the AGO years ago. I guess I went through phases for awhile and felt I'd seen all there was to see. I was wrong. Very very wrong. It's always important to remember that Toronto establishments rarely stay the same for long.   My crepe was excellent, but the highlight was the handmade chocolates. I would recommend going for one of the daily specials, and then picking up an array of chocolates to take home with you."}
{"text":"OMG, I don't know why it took me 4 years to try this place, but it is AMAZING!  I love crepes and have tried most other creperies in the city, and I was very pleasantly surprised with this cafe...  Excellent quality ingredients, friendly servers who give you your space (a plus in my book) and unique, wide beverage selection.  I had the Desert For Grown-Ups crepe which was phenomenal- pistachios, figs marinated in grand marnier and blue cheese- yum!  The chocolate chai tea was the perfect accompaniment and I appreciated the copius amount of cocoa without added sweetener.  Prices are great for the quality, I will most definitely be back:)."}
{"text":"One of my preferred spots to hang out and read/work in the area. The cafe also serves as a mini gallery and continually changes its exhibits. I've had their crepes and a few confections, the profiteroles being my favorite. The tea selection is really nice. Overall 3 stars since the food isn't phenomenal,  but it's decent fare and the venue is great."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend this place. Went here to try the crepes and was horribly disappointed. The crepe was dry and floury and there didn't seem to be much chocolate sauce. The service also was super slow and the lady gave me the wrong order."}
{"text":"I love this place. Yummy  crepes, organic chocolate, and turkish delight. I love their Turkish Coffee and Turkish Latte. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I wouldn't really call this place a café.  It's more or less of an art display space with a snack station.  When I first saw the reviews of this place, most of them read ' bad or slow service '. However my friend insisted to try the place since it is one of the few that serve Crepe Suzzette.  The first impression you will get is of the art pieces. Most of the items on display are for sale. So it's a good place to visit for the art fans.   However foodies, this place isn't for you.  They didn't have at least 2 of the items on the menu, which is something you usually first tell a customer before giving them a menu to decide on for 10 minutes.   We finally decided on the pistachio with chocolate (with added ice cream) and the crepe suzzette.  They only have two flavors of ice cream; chocolate and vanilla.   I ordered the vanilla with the pistachio chocolate crepe. When the dishes came out though, they served a chocolate ice cream scoop on the crepe suzette and told me that they don't have vanilla ice cream.  I chose to just eat the crepe in despair and found the inner chocolate of the pistachio chocolate crepe to be a little burnt from the heat. Making what was supposed to be a sweet dessert, bitter.   So in summary. Food isn't great. Service is worse.  I wouldn't recommend it"}
{"text":"I came here on a rainy evening looking for some quiet time.  I snagged a tiny two-top and went up to the counter to ask for a menu.  I've been here a handful of times and I still can't figure out if it's a help yourself kind of place or full service.  The waitress comes around to take orders and check on you.... occasionally.  Perhaps I'm just impatient and sometimes I've marched straight up to the counter to place my order, and I've seen others do the same.  I ordered a soy latte and a lemon and brown sugar buckwheat crepe.  Latte was so-so (they burned the soy) but the crepe was delicious.  There's more lemon than sugar, so be prepared for sour.  I later followed with my favourite beverage here: the chai latte, served in the heaviest teapot in the world.  The pot serves about two cups and their chai has just enough interesting flavours for me.  (I find some chai teas too crazy and overwhelming.)  So they advertise free wifi and when I tried it out I needed a password.  When I mentioned this to the staff, they told me that I don't need a password.  I was too lazy to figure out the situation and continued to work away, sans wifi.  Then another customer asked me about it, assuming I was connected.  I told him my story and he said he had the same issue.  He eventually convinced the staff that their network was indeed password-protected and they gave him a password.  When it didn't work for him, he asked me to try it - just in case.  Of course it didn't work for me either.  Then, this persistent customer explained to them that this was the wrong password and insisted there must be some other password.  Persistent customer was right and we eventually figured it all out.  In conclusion: there is wifi.  You just have to ask them for the password twenty times.  Thanks to the dude who hooked me up.  I like coming here because I can usually find a free table and it's usually not too loud.  This time 'round the girl at the next table used her outdoor voice the entire time (maybe because the door was left open?).  I learned a lot about this stranger.  (Did you know that in some parts of Europe you can be fined for being too loud in public?)    There's art in the front area."}
{"text":"Quiet little cafe with a decent menu. The Canadian crepe was great; maple syrup and an amazing strawberry jam were provided. Other dishes on the menu were not that appealing. Just a great place to sit down with your laptop and kill some time. Not enough room for a large group, 4 people max."}
{"text":"It pains me to give only two stars to Art Square, as the food is generally delicious and they have some good coffee and tea, but today wasn't their best effort.  I should start off by saying that I'm a semi-regular, so I know that they can be slow when things get hectic. The AGO had just closed for the day and it was busy (not insane, but busy) at the cafe. The gentleman working was very gracious in offering to set up a table for us in the gallery space and we happily took it. So far, so good, but sadly fail ensued at that point. I'll try to sum up the experience our group of six had, as succinctly as I can:  -Sat down at 4:00 -Ordered at 4:15 (two crepes, five cups of coffee and a tea) -Two cups of coffee arrived at 5:00 -Third cup arrived five minutes later -Went to the counter at 5:15 to discover that no food preparation had begun -Cancelled food portion of our order and paid for the coffee.  To this point, we had been patient and were in no way irritable with the staff. We understood that the two staff members were very busy with the crowd of people, but we just wanted to cut our losses and head out. The lady working behind the counter came out and was clearly irritated that we were cancelling our food order and seemed incredulous that we wouldn't realize that it would take some time for our order to be filled. She said \"We set up a table for you and told you that it would be a while to get your food.\", which was false. At no time did anyone say it would be a while for the food, let alone over an hour without the food even being started. Basically, this person came out, lied about what was said and then gave us attitude for wanting to leave. She then abruptly ended the conversation by walking off, after I pointed out the inconsistencies in what she was saying. She wasn't out any effort, since she hadn't prepared any food. Why the attitude, when we hadn't shown her any? How about an apology?  Bizarre and unprofessional."}
{"text":"Stopped by Art Square Cafe for a little late night dessert with the hubby and little man :)  We all shared a Crepes Suzette and loved it!  It was recommended to us by a European foodie friend.  And according to her, its authentically delicious!  Its hard for me to describe ... hmmm ...just try it!    At the time, there was some sort of gallery party going on.  Its a pretty cool spot to check out some cool art.  What an awesome little romantic cafe!"}
{"text":"Awesome art on the walls, the drinks were delicious and very unique...for example virgin mojito-style drink made with real lemons and limes. Yum!  They offer many organic options in everything from their salad to their chocolates.  Their wi-fi can be a bit inconsistent, but it's generally solid."}
{"text":"I dropped in at Art Square Cafe for an event in the basement, and not at the actual restaurant on the main level so I can't comment on the food. For this music and dance event, the basement spot was great! They had a sweet little bar set up, and the stage was off the left as you enter the basement, seen through a partition separating an elevated stage from the rest of the space. The musicians had plenty of room to do their thing as well as the dancers. Sound was top notch that night too. Even though it got hot and sweaty in there, it was a perfectly enjoyable experience.  The walls are adorned with some interesting art pieces as well. Outside the door, there is a nice semi-private patio space at the same level so it was easy to get away from the action without having to hang in the street. AGO is right across the street and was buzzing with one of their evening events, which helped add to the vibrant atmosphere of the evening."}
{"text":"I had the worse tasting crepe ever - buckwheat crepe with chicken, red sauce & dark chocolate. The flavours simply do not blend well.  And horrible green tea latte - undissolved green tea power mixed in a glass of milk.   Wi-Fi is terrible.   Though they do have a nice atmosphere & patio."}
{"text":"Art on the walls for sale with very unique and delicious cafe at the back. A bit confusing about how to order (at the counter? At the table? I think the answer is either one?) We had cappuccino, americano, and a few of the homemade chocolates. It was very tasty with friendly service, but it took a bit long to come out for what we ordered. We would go back though and try smoked salmon and goats cheese crepes!"}
{"text":"After being thoroughly disappointed with the cappuccino here I wasn't sure I should come back here. I had tried their other packaged products which though being organic and made from items that are made from ingredients that are from the deepest, darkest more inaccessible part of the world didn't wow me.  So after a hitting a snag for regular crepe place (slammed with a looong wait time) we ended up here. They were about to close but were kind enough to accommodate us provided we order fast.  Unfortunately they were out of crepe suzette, ah well I settled with a Canadian Crepe and my friend ordered a Chocolate & Pistachio version. The crepes arrived fast and were visually appealing. I tried the Chocolate & Pistachio and it was decent. The Canadian Crepe was quite good and I really liked the sauce on the side as it was just right to add the intense whiskey/sweet taste. Good stuff here folks. The service was friendly and got friendlier as I practiced my few sentence of Turkish with them 3.5 stars. I will be back to try the Crepe Suzzette."}
{"text":"This is a great find. I went here awhile ago before going to the ago and it's a very friendly and cozy Cafe! I love how they have huge paintings surrounding the walls and delicious crepes and treats to pair w your coffee or specialty beverage. Service here is very friendly and it's an overall relaxed environment which is wonderful to cozy up in on a lazy weekend afternoon"}
{"text":"my problem wasn't with the food but with signing up to their artist membership plan. terrible communication and when i followed up i received more excuses to the terrible communication."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is always really good. With that being said, the service is another story. The employees take a really long time to bring you your food and don't even remember to bring you water.   On a high note, they offer gluten free options, which include sweet and savoury crepes. This was really exciting for me since I can't really enjoy too much food at most restaurants. The crepes are really good! Both my savoury and dessert crepe, on two different occasions were phenomenal. My friend also really liked her crepes the times we have ventured here.   In addition to the delicious food, this restaurant has great ambiance. They always feature different local artwork in the front of the cafe for guests to browse. The artwork also features the price on the lower corner in case you decide you want to make the piece a part of your home.   Food: 5 stars Service: 2 stars Ambiance: 3 stars Washrooms: 2 stars  Allover, this is a solid three star cafe opposite the AGO."}
{"text":"This place is highly underrated.  Get the crepe calzones and the white sangria and sit on the side patio surrounded by art, if you can.  Very good!"}
{"text":"Was hoping to attend an event at the AGO which ended up being sold out. Looked across the street and saw this cafe open, such a lucky find! Very intimate space, open to the kitchen, lovely gallery upstairs. The real gem is the downstairs gallery. It's a big open space with some unique paintings. From the cafe we got a sweet crepe and a savory crepe both were tasty, had good portion sizes and were filling. The turkish tea came with a turkish delight and was well received. The kashmiri tea was also nicely spiced with cardamom and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"i love the prifteroles!! if i'm spelling the correctly! ha! nice staff. the art gallery in the front is now called \"the east side\" so it seems like it has been renamed but then the paper bag the staff from the cafe gave me had a sticker on it and it still says: art square cafe."}
{"text":"Beautiful vibrant paintings deck the walls of this modern cafe. A younger crowd mainly hangs in the seats and tables. We walked in drawn by the promise of chocolate. I found myself grabbing a few homemade truffles by wooden tongs in flavors like earl grey lemon, almond amaretto, and champagne.   Eating the truffles a few days later and with a few 100 miles of tossling rendered them kind of ugly, not that they were that pretty to begin with. The word \"homemade\" is really taken seriously here. However the taste is delectable. Each truffle had a creamy flavorful ganache center.  I'd love to sit in this cafe and stare at all the paintings over an espresso."}
{"text":"We had a great brunch here.  We wanted to hit the AGO and this place is right across the streets.  My family had spent the previous night having Indian cuisine (their first time) and probably wanted something more familiar.  And they did.  Banana walnut, and *very* berry crepes - something from the sweet crepes menu.  My wife and I had something from the savory side of the menu.  Oh, turkish coffee and turkish delight were a nice treat as an appetizer(?), really good food and a great atmosphere.  Especially great warm-up if you're headed across the street to the AGO."}
{"text":"Lunch with a friend. Spinach crepe needed more filling. Lentil soup needed more flavor. Coffee was very good. They forgot our fresh juice order, so I'm not sure how my mango papaya was.... For a lunch rush they need better efficiency, maybe a dedicated cashier who could help bus, etc.  Cool space. Great looking menu. But needs improvement."}
{"text":"Not much else is open in the area for a Sunday breakfast.  The omelet was well-spiced, and the food was great.  Extra coffee means extra charges.  The décor is cute and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Nice French speaking counter people.   Great coffee.  Free wireless. All nestled into a nice art gallery with plenty of seating.  Their specialty here is crepe's with various fillings, but I opted for their coffee, and some of their specialty candy from their counter.  Nice place.  They could speed up the service just a bit."}
{"text":"I think a certain type of person would love this place, but I'm not that type of person. The concept is neat and I appreciate that they use organic products which makes it a bit pricey but other than atmosphere, I'd give this place a thumbs down. The hot chocolate was absolutely bitter and my pastry was given to me still frozen. The server fumbled with some excuse about something being broken. The pastry was brought back substantially warmer after a long wait but still not great. But as I said, I like the concept and the atmosphere was great for a lazy Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Coffee was great , n the price is quite affordable, but I just loved the location,  specifically the backyard patio, perfect place for branching by yourself :)"}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place.  A few friends and I went to this painting event that was organized by Art Tonite.  They were very friendly and accommodating to the event attendees and didn't rush anyone to pay and were very organized.  I'm no wine connoisseur so wine is wine to me, but I'm a huge critic of tea.  I had the Canada Snow tea and wow, it was amazing!    It tasted like it had chrysanthemum or something but it had a nice natural sweetness to it.  It was delicious.  As i was paying my bill, I was asking about vegan options and while not on the menu, they said they could easily make the crepes without milk or eggs and I was so excited when they said that.  I love it when places are so flexible.    Also, since they are right across from AGO and OCAD, they have a lot of nice art hanging from the walls and some amazing sculptures.      If I'm in the area, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"$2.05 for a mug of extremely weak coffee filled half full is not ok by me!   Went in for a joe and perhaps a dessert and after the owner and servers finished arguing in the kitchen, my order was taken. 5 minutes later I had my half-mug o joe.   I hate to be so whiny, but too many times this same situation has happened here for it to be a fluke incident. The owner and service here are awful. The crepes are really quite good, but the owner and service here are awful."}
{"text":"\"We walked through the gallery all the way back where the café was and wondered how many people might have actually never make it all the way back. Perhaps the experience is to wonder through the bright gallery area (white walls, black frames) and eventually end up at the café. \" \"The last crepe we shared was Chocolate and Pistachio with organic, fair trade dark chocolate. This somewhat bitter crepe was a great option, especially accompanying a Turkish coffee - another specialty of Art Square, which comes in a traditional turkish tea cup and with a side of Turkish Delight. We both were very content with this crepe - dark chocolate lovers you should indulge away!\"  \"Overall, we were very excited to see this unique space operate and try to bring a new experience to dining and art. It opens up a conversation around art in cafes being more than wall decoration.\" Just a few bites of our full review.."}
{"text":"Interesting concept; I liked how half of the dining area was a compact art gallery, and the other half had a few small cafe tables. The \"indoor\" patio was interesting; it was more of a small courtyard in the middle of the cafe. I liked how the patio had a lot of character; the tables were amidst brick walls, where a few pieces of art work were hung.   My friend and I came with a Buytopia coupon good for 2 glasses of wine, 2 savoury crepes and 2 dessert crepes. I had an iced cafe mocha, the spinach and walnut (buckwheat) crepe, and the chocolate and pistachio crepe.  Lets start with the good. The crepes were large and filling; the filling inside each crepe was quite generous. However, I felt that the crepe itself was too thick and a bit too doughy. Flavour didn't blow me away, but it wasn't terrible.   This was one of the worst cafe mochas I've ever had; the coffee taste was weak, and there were coffee grounds settling at the bottom of my glass. Unpleasant."}
{"text":"As there wasn't a better crêpe place near AGO,  we settled for Art Square. Being a three star cafe, I knew I was going to get mediocre crêpes-and that's exactly what I got.   I ordered the buckwheat spinach walnut crepe,  and although the crêpe consistency itself is decent (thin and light), the filling had no flavour!  I tasted only pepper.  The egg was fried and bland,  spinach barely cooked,  and I had to add my own cinnamon and salt (the maple syrup didn't help). Also,  I was a little disappointed that the walnuts are only sprinkled on top as a light crumble and not incorporated on the inside.   The place isn't big but the waiter never came to check in on us or filled our water.  Friendly staff though and the art gallery atmosphere is unique."}
{"text":"I've been coming here with a friend for a couple years now. Delicious desert crepes - my favourite is the chocolate and pistachio. The chocolate fondue is to die for. Very rich with rolled pieces of crepe and fruit to dip in it. It's more than enough for two people as we usually have some left over. The cheese fondue is also wonderful. Served with crepes, olives, broccoli and other veggies. It's very filling and delicious. We also tend to share the white sangria which is some of the best i've had in the city.  It's also an art gallery with different displays and installations from time to time. The inside is bright and comfortable and there is a small patio in the back which is my favourite part of the place.  When I first started coming here the service was incredibly slow but it is much better now.   Will be coming back next time i'm in the area or when i'm craving fondue."}
{"text":"A nice simple cafe with light fare if you are looking to relax after a day at AGO. There is a nice gallery at the entrance with contemporary art exhibits. At the back there is a small, but nice patio. The patio is definitely recommended for summer visits."}
{"text":"We stopped in for coffee this morning, and everything about this place was good. I wish we had gone back here for brunch instead of where we did go.  First, the decor was outstanding. What a cool gallery space to use for a cafe!  Second, the service was very friendly and quick. We just did coffee to go, so not too difficult, but the woman behind the counter and the server up front both offered to help in a friendly manner.  The coffee was very good too. I was admiring all the handmade chocolates and truffles, and the crepes look delicious. I am definitely returning for the food."}
{"text":"When we walked in here after dinner, I thought we interrupted an art session that was going on as there was no dining customers there, lol. But this place is surely pretty and modern...I like art so this little type of gallery/cafe is a nice find. I just didn't enjoy the food as much that I personally ordered, but my partner seemed to like his. I ordered:   iced chocolate - which tasted like water and cocoa powder with ice that you would make at home. Nothing special. They could make this one better if they sort of blended it on a certain signature concoction. Don't recommend it.   Dark chocolate croissant- am assuming since I ordered this at night it didn't taste as good because it tasted a little stale. I think this would be better in the morning if it was fresh.   Banana and walnut crepe - this was a nice choice by my partner. It was actually yummy. I would get it in the future provided that I know their good at making these.   Overall, I would come back here, try their other items because lets be honest, its a really pretty gallery/cafe and am a sucker for it. The food is still a hit or miss so I might change my mind if I go here enough times and bump up my rating. I like how it seemed like a private dining place (but not really) because I like how you can sit and talk and not feel too overcrowded. If that makes sense. (*hint: date place approved)  Try them out!"}
{"text":"Poor service and menu items not well represented. I ordered a spinach and walnut crepe for breakfast, which the menu said included feta, spinach, walnuts and egg. My bf placed his order and to drink, he ordered coffee and I ordered tea. We got our food before our drinks. My crepe was not very full, and didn't appear to have any egg inside. It took quite  awhile for our waitress to return to ask how things were. I told her there was no egg, and she pointed to the yellow lightly spread inside the crepe and said that was the \"egg\" or runny yolk\". Not what I was expecting, but she didn't seem to care. We also told her we didn't have our drinks. She came by later, after my bf was finished with his meal, and brought his coffee and brought me an empty cup. When I finished my meal, we stayed a minute or two longer and then just left. Never did get my tea. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon, as you walk in, every wall is hung with art pieces, and walking further inside, there's tables, chairs as well as a counter with sweets displayed.  You can sit wherever you want, there's menus already placed on the table for you to browse through. There's a selection of savory crepes, cal-zone, sweet crepes, coffees, teas, and even alcohol. Once you're ready to order, a waitress will come serve you. There's a little hidden outdoor patio near the side of the cashier which is pretty cool. Although you can't see any street views because it looks like a space created by back and sides of buildings, the vibe is pretty amazing. Pieces of paintings are still hung all over this secret space and since it's mostly shaded by the walls, it's perfect to sit on a hot sunny day.  We bought a deal online for 1 savory crepe each, which we got the Mediterranean and spinach and cheese, 1 sweep crepe to share, which we got the homemade jam and brie and 2 specialty drinks or a glass of wine, which we got a cold hot chocolate and a Turkish coffee. The savory crepes came pretty quickly but as we ate into our crepes, there was barely any toppings or stuffings in the crepes. Spinach and cheese had like 6 pieces of spinach leaves in the WHOLE crepe and cheese was all gathered in one area which had like 1 tablespoon max. Same with the Mediterranean one, I felt like I was eat crepe with a little pizza sauce. There was so much crepe but not enough fillings, so it was SUPER DISAPPOINTING!!  The cold chocolate tasted like it was made from the powder drinks with ice. The Turkish coffee was more satisfying which was more enjoyable. As we were talking and eating away still with our savory crepe, about half way done, the waitress brings the sweet crepe. We were shocked because we did not ask for it, our table did not have room for it and it created an awkward moment where the waitress and I starred at each other for a couple of seconds.   When we were finally ready for the sweet crepe, it was like the other ones, DISAPPOINTING! There was again not enough filling which made me feel like I'm just eating crepes. And the crepe batter wasn't impressive either, just the ordinary but with a lot of flour.  I would never come back to this place, at least definitely not for food. 2 stars is for the vibe, atmosphere, and their drinks."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place.  It's across from the AGO and the first thing you see when you walk in is art work.  It's perfect for the area.  However, after that it seems to fall apart.  A point in its favour is it does serve an OK cup of Illy coffee. However, the other edible item they reserve a majority of counter space to is their handmade chocolates. I believe the woman behind the counter said her brother had made them.  Now, I have to say, I'm a real chocolate snob.  Actually, I'm an awful chocolate snob.  I've had the best chocolate in the world. Done tastings and worked with a master chocolatier for 6 years. This my friend, is for what you are paying.  not so good.  Sometimes, the flavours are too heavy handed in the liquors and other times their flavour idea's good but the taste was just not there. Very disappointing.  I must say, the mini wooden spoons that come with your coffee are adorable.  I am curious about their crepes.  I love crepes and haven't tried any in the city yet.  The big bonus here is they have a gluten free option!! Celiacs will be happy to have another place to eat!  Would this place be more of a destination if the customer service was better? Of course.  From what I can tell, alot of Yelpers feel the same way."}
{"text":"This is such a sweet little cafe. While the service is terrible, the food more than makes up for it! Dropped in for a bite after a trip to the AGO. It's like the mullet of cafes - gallery in the front, cafe in the back. The gallery has a nice selection of work, and the cafe is just precious. There are fabulous teas and coffees (and a selection of booze to add to coffees!!), as well as a huge menu of sweet things, crepes, even fondue! The menu inexplicably says that the tiramisu \"will remind men of the love they feel for their women\" - there are no other notations like this on the menu?? So of course, I ordered the tiramisu, and of course, they were sold out of it. Booo!!! Amused myself with some profiteroles instead - sooooo decadent! Balls of creamy pastry in a big ass cup of chocolate. It's stupid. Stupid delicious. :) My friend had a full on meal with a breakfast crepe, it smelled divine, and the bite I sampled was scrumptious. Also had gorgeous fragrant iced tea, can't wait to sample more of their copious tea selection! I can live with the poor service, it's worth it. Also, there is a little courtyard patio that I think will be awesome come summertime. Looking forward to spending more time here! :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I went in today to grab a coffee. I had a cappuccino and she got a hot chocolate. They were both extremely watered down and bitter. So bad that we couldn't get past the first few sips. The place was very busy and the food looked good but I will definitely not be returning. Two stars for the art!"}
{"text":"Some of the negative reviews you might read are mostly a case of expectations.  This is a REALLY laid back little coffee / crepe spot, inside of a small art gallery facing the AGO.  The service is slow. That's just the way it is: relaxed. If you want something fast, you have to make that very clear. ( I would recommend going up to order and pay)   Recommended:  - crepe (there are many kinds) - tea - they have an interesting selection of teas that serve 2 people and come in some heavy duty pots.  I haven't tried them, but they also have turkish delights and chocolates."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for dinner with a few friends.  I've passed by this place 10 million times, and never ventured inside.  They're supposedly known for the truffles, crepes, and illy coffee.  However, sadly, I never got to try their truffles.  The place was nice and small, but cozy.  The servers were quite nice.  I ordered myself a smoked salmon crepe with goat cheese.  Usually, I'm not a fan of goat cheese, but this crepe was actually quite amazing.  A definite recommend!  It also came with organic green salad with a bit of balsamic dressing.  What I found interesting about the crepe was the contents inside of it -- I'm not sure what it was, but I think it was the \"green sauce\" that they describe on the website: homemade with dill, parsley, olive oil, lemon zest, and garlic.  It was delicious.  The cappuciuno was a good way to end the night.  Great place to have conversation with a friend on a night!"}
{"text":"Interesting location and concept fitting of an area like Dundas and McCaul. The place is largely an art gallery, with a coffee shop tucked in the back.   But it's too bad that the cafe feels like an afterthought. The overwhelming, tacky menu (with drinks named after the president of OCADU) misses the mark for a cafe which devotes itself to art.   The server was kind and sweet, apologizing profusely when she discovered that they were out of the green tea latte I had ordered. So I got a chai latte instead. Mistake. I'm not sure if this is an \"authentic\" way of making chai lattes or something, but this one was watery, bland and full of floating particulate. It felt like I was chewing sawdust and coffee grinds between sips.   Not recommend."}
{"text":"Had a little time to kill before heading to the AGO and saw this little cafe right across the street. Art Square Cafe turned into my workspace for the next 3 hours to follow.   When I first entered, I was naturally drawn to the artwork hanging on the walls. It definitely looks like a mini art gallery when you walk in. The place was empty when I got there (roughly 9AM) -- just the owner (I'm going to assume he was the owner in this instance) and a waitress.   The owner was friendly and greeted me warmly. I asked in advance if it was ok if I ordered a drink and hang around to do some work. He said that was fine.   I found a nice spot on their outdoor seating area (you need to come inside and then proceed to the back outdoor area). There was an outlet, so that helped. Such a pretty place to get some work done, I recommend Art Square Cafe on that alone!   I ordered the lemonade and croissant with goat cheese. The croissant was delicious and the lemonade was refreshing. It was the consistency of a slushy and also not sweetened. I'm sure you can ask for it to be sweetened though, I didn't ask.    By the time 11AM hit, the place started to fill up. Lots of tourists but a great vibe nonetheless.   Definitely recommend this place if you're in the area. The back outdoors space is worth a look!  ** Yes, they do have wifi.  4.5/5"}
{"text":"Had a lovely time here! I stopped by here with my touristy cousins to go for a coffee break. I ordered the Turkish Coffee Latte, which I enjoyed. Not too strong or sweet and it came with a cute lil' wooden spoon. Its the details that the owners put in, which I truly admired. From the slightly creepy masks hanging from the ceiling to the beautiful abstract artwork hanging on the walls, the owners definitely thought this place through.   We had to wait awhile for our coffees, but that was no problem as we weren't in a rush. Plus, we were rewarded with chocolate clusters on the side for the long wait, which didn't hurt because I will always be bought by chocolate. Will stop by again to try their crepes!"}
{"text":"It is said that \"Art lies in the eye of the beholder.\"  I couldn't agree more.  After a heavy Italian lunch at Il Gatto Nero, and wandering around Kensington Market, we were looking for a little mid-afternoon 'pick me up' in the form of a caffeinated beverage.  This place would by no means have been by first choice, but China Town by Spadina and Dundas is completely devoid of Coffee places. Art Square Cafe was like coming upon an oasis in the desert.  \"Yes!  Espresso S'il vous plait.\"  I was a bit confused about the layout.  It looked like a coffee shop to me, but I was promptly reminded that it was a 'restaurant' after I went to the counter to order and was banished back to my seat.  \"Sit down, and we'll bring it to you.\"   Their deserts were bizarre.  All they had were biscotti, which I don't like.  And a vast assortment of little chocolate balls. I was hoping for a good cookie or something.  I decided to pass.  After waiting at least ten minutes, during which I fought the urge to walk out, our drinks finally arrived.  Espresso was expensive - $3.5 for a double shot.  Before we left I went down to the strangest washroom ever.  It is downstairs through a labyrinth of twists and turns.    As the Art Square Cafe is right across the street from the AGO, they had various forms of uninspiring 'art' for sale.    Above our table were three small paintings that looked like feces smeared on a canvas.  But to be fair they were only $400 each.  There were also some generic blurry pictures of female bodies in graceful poses.  I liked these a bit more, but they were frankly nothing special.  They looked vaguely like knock off of something by Da Vinci. $2,000 each.  The kicker was some sculptures on the tables.  They were hollow shapes made out of wires to resemble vines.  Cool!  I actually liked these ones.  There was a sphere, and a cylinder.  On my way out I checked the prices, and they were like $12,000 each.    They're the kind of thing you could expect to see in an arts and crafts shop in Port Hope for $250.  Or maybe some factory in China could mass produce them for $50 each.  We're talking wires molded into common three dimensional shapes.  It reminded me of reading an article in the news about a year ago that the cost of living was too high in Toronto.  Agreed.  However the proof they used was an interview with a local 'artist' who was complaining that his $2000/month 2 bedroom apartment was too expensive.  At the time I was living in a 3 bedroom on Danforth Avenue costing about $1250 and I thought: \"What is this guy talking about?\"  Anyone who has rented in Toronto and done a bit of research knows there are plenty of 2 bedrooms around the $1000 mark.  Or god forbid, if you don't have a stable income - take something cheaper.    There is definitely some kind of disconnect between the artistic community and reality as the rest of us know it.  $12,000 for a wire sphere?  $2,000 apartments?    Suffice to say,  I won't be returning to the Art Square Cafe.  It was pretentious without justification.  Plus their menu was very strange, and the help wasn't friendly.  Nothing except biscotti and chocolate balls!  You may be seated!"}
{"text":"Delicious crepes.     An amazing collection of art schoolers and ESL students tapping away at the free wi-fi.  Gorgeous serving staff.   Excellent haircuts.  Delicious crepes.  All the shiny shiny of being in the middle of a small gallery across from a very big gallery with none of the horrible pretension or lost puppy.    Delicious crepes."}
{"text":"This is a cute place! Once you walk in, there is open space with beautiful artwork.  We sat on the patio, tucked away outside.  All the crepes were AMAZING!I got the salmon, goat cheese buckwheat crepe with spinach salad.  Other orders included eggplant crepe, Canadian crepe (eggs and chicken bacon), and dark chocolate and pistachio.  All the ingredients are super fresh.  The homemade strawberry jam was delicious, and the maple syrup hits the spot!  My comparison is usually to San Francisco based businesses, and this was definitely better than a lot of the crepe places I frequent in the city."}
{"text":"Came here twice. First time was okay, but the second experience was not good unfortunately. I came for brunch with my sister and we both ordered crepes. We ended up waiting 20 minutes before the waitress came to tell us they didn't have eggs in stock and so someone ran off to buy eggs. We totally could've just picked something else from the menu, I think that was handled poorly. The food itself was okay. I most likely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I wanted a snack after going to the AGO. The location couldn't be beat but in retrospect I should have walked a bit further to somewhere decent  Food was passable but priced to gouge. Service was bad - staff was forgetful and didn't seem to know the menu contents or how to work together. This place is a tourist trap and should be avoided."}
{"text":"Really cool place. The owner, Leyla, is super friendly, the food is great and location is amazing! You will love it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the city.  Across from a museum and among galleries (including itself), it serves delicious Illy coffee (same as I drink at home), has healthy eating options in the form of savory crepes, and desserts, and great teas.  The prices are a bit high but I'm pretty sure it's justified by looking at their ingredients...you really are paying for quality here.  The space is nicely laid out, brightly lit, there is free wi-fi, it's open till 10pm or 11pm every night, and it's on the way home from school/work.  I come here several times a week and know the people who work here by name.   The service here is admittedly not great (okay, it's plain bad) and that costs it one star.  If you order a crepe and you want water with that then you'd better ask for water else you won't get it. Same for refills. If you finish your meal don't expect them to take the empty plate from your table.  If you order a drink then you'll probably have to ask for a napkin.  If you order an Americano then you have to explain how you want it because the thing they'll bring out otherwise is NOT an Americano.  The people here are really very friendly and nice, they're just not service oriented and are too busy cooking to be attentive to customers in the dining area.  If you just ask they'll be happy to provide whatever you need."}
{"text":"An excellent stop for lunch after visiting the AGO.  Great coffee drinks.  Excellent crepes, savory and sweet.  Very organic and responsible with their recyclables.  Only a few outdoor tables, so if it's nice out, grab them quick."}
{"text":"Yo this place has dope coffee. Legit and I drink a billion ounces a day. Hidden. Please don't come here you will ruin the cool and hidden coffee spot that I love"}
{"text":"Relaxing atmosphere, good strong coffee, and delicious crepes. Go there on a first date, check out the rotating art works, grab some dessert, finish off with some strong turkish coffee :) This place also has free wi-fi, bright walls and a fresh, open ambiance.  It's located right across the AGO. Worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The hubby and I stumbled upon Art Square Cafe by accident, well okay actually he wanted to go to Sin and Redemption, and I was like all eye-roll about that so we ended up here :D  Art Square really impressed me with amazingly polite and friendly service from the super nice Turkish folks who work and own the establishment and our male server especially was full of smiles and just so lovely all around.  I can't speak for the slow service previous Yelpers have mentioned, as I came here with hubby on a Monday around 5pm and got served pretty proficiently.    I chose the daily special which was veggie pancakes of shredded zucchini, with a sour yoghurt dipping sauce that reminded me of raita, but with a dash of paprika instead of mint was served alongside a green salad all this loveliness was $8.50, hubby's lunch looked to be an unusual combination of shrimp crepes with cheese and oranges(??) but he gobbled it up like Gollum ravishing a raw fish so this assured me of it's delectability, I think?  Aside from lunch fare  Art Square Cafe also features an extensive array of desserts and *gasp* home made chocolates!!!  The FRANK GEHRY truffle is AMAZING!!!  Comprised of Maple Syrup, organic wine, 80% dark chocolate and pure silver, it truly is a work of chocolate art!  Speaking of art, the cafe is connected with the East Gallery featuring vibrant works by celebrated South East Asian artists, so not only do you get to enjoy a lovely nosh, but you get to feast your eyes as well.  I'm really shocked and saddened by the negative reviews as our experience here was most definitely a very positive one, and I won't hesitate to come back.  I give Art Square Cafe a well deserved 4.5."}
{"text":"Had a Buytopia coupon. Needless to say their better choices were not included in the coupon so buyer beware.  Service was a bit slow, however friendly. The crepes were very poor on our visit. Four of us ordered different meals and two of had desert crepes as well. They were terrible. Very rubbery texture. Based on this one experience I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"--- Food ---   I've been here twice, for the same thing both times - Chocolate Fondue for Two! It costs $16.50 per person. It comes with a wooden tray with dark chocolate fondue under candle in the middle with fresh fruits and crepes placed nicely around. The chocolate is quite sweet (perhaps a tad too sweet). Very filling for two people. Fruits (apple, pears, strawberries) are fresh and taste delicious with fondue. The crepes are delicious as well (they're made freshly hence warm and soft). They provide wooden sticks to pick up the items.   They offer us to take home the unfinished chocolate fondue (we've never been able to finish it, it's a lot of chocolate). We took it home however it turned into a solid chocolate brick as expected.   --- Atmosphere --- Nice atmosphere located in downtown Toronto. It's called Art Square Cafe because there's an art gallery in front of the cafe. They hung different paintings each time I visited, which is a nice change of atmosphere each time as well. The staff are pleasant and friendly. Street parking only, easily accessible with TTC streetcars.   --- Summary ---  I will definitely come back when I have a craving for chocolate fondue and chocolate crepes again. It's a nice atmosphere to hang out with a friend."}
{"text":"Confused! Everyone here was confused! From the barrista taking my order to the other staff running around in the \"kitchen\" like chickens with their head cut off; everyone here super frazzled.  After and awesome trip to the AGO, I decided to venture into Art Square Cafe for a latte.  I thought it was a cute concept to have  coffee shop and art gallery right across from the AGO. The whole thing took 15 minutes! The barrista had to ask me to repeat my order three times (regular latte to go). and then proceeded to burn my beverage.   My latte was by far the worst I had ever drank, and tasted like hot water and burnt beans!  I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Nice decor and service. I love the cozy outdoor patio, even it's very small but you can see the sky/clouds and feel the breeze. My Turkish coffee is kinda bitter and strong, I couldn't fall asleep till 4 am lol Please be aware that if you cannot have strong coffee after 3pm like me, just skip the Turkish one.  Still a good place for afternoon tea"}
{"text":"I revisted this spot for a morning coffee and breakfast. Let me come right out and say it: service here is sl o o  o    o   w. I think it took about 30 minutes before I took my first sip, and a bit longer before I got my crêpe. I can't fault the server --she was alone-- but I sure am glad I had nothing better to do.  Half cafe, half art gallery, the Art Square Cafe is a petit spot across from the art gallery of Ontario. They feature artwork by rotating artists and in the back is a full-fledged cafe with crêpes, desserts, and Illy espresso.   I showed up for breakfast, and snagged a lemon and brown sugar buckwheat crêpe which was pretty solid. My cappuccino was good, but sadly not too warm. Not a bad place to visit for it's late hours and diverse menu. The gallery makes it a great spot for a date.  Obligatory Title Pun: It's hip to be SQUARE.  Menu Readability: Usually I just walk up to the counter and order what I feel like.   Need to mention: There is free wifi.   What this place teaches me about myself: I am the world's biggest non-ironic Huey Lewis fan."}
{"text":"Pro:  The coffee shop / restaurant is located inside an art exhibit. And the art pieces are fantastic and you don't even feel like you're sitting in a coffee shop. The artist is also on site to chat about his pieces or if you want to buy.   There's also lots of seating both indoors and right beside the art as well as a patio at the back.   Con:  I got an iced tea and it had a LOT of ice in it and so by the end it was mostly water and dilated tea. And for the price (4.50) I think it was not worth it. And I also got the banana loaf and again it's pretty average and slightly more expensive than other places. (2.60). But what got me was how close of seating is to the kitchen. Because they're a restaurant the whole place smells like fried eggs and there's also no AC and it can get pretty stuffy. They do have Internet but it's pretty slow and spotty as well.   All in all I would come here once for the novelty of it but definitely would not become a regular spot."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. It's across from the art museum, and the concept is a gallery/cafe. However, the white gallery walls were completely empty. Another wall was painted a grass-green colour which stood in harsh contrast to the rest of the place. There were random shelves with chocolates, dog treats, and other items that seemed to have no relevance to one another or to the concept or menu items. The service was alright,  the menu choices were interesting although slightly pricey for what they were, and our food (Crepes Suzette and an omelette) was decent. However, I think I expected more from this place based on its outside appearance, and was disconcerted by the somewhat uncomfortable and bland atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great little café across from the AGO!  Great food - mainly crepes (savoury and sweet; and with a choice of buckwheat or white crepe!), sweets (organic chocolate) and some Turkish specialties. A wonderful selection of teas, and they serve good illy coffee. Discount if you bring your own travel mug!  The atmosphere is casual, with a small gallery attached to the actual café - it is meant to be a place to relax. Open late compared to other similar shops.   And with free wifi, that's an invitation to stay a while longer. ;)"}
