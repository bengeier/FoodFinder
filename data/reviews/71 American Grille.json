{"text":"This place has several pros and several cons. It's really nice to see a local operating this restaurant. The concept is pretty well executed with a 1970's decor and simple menu. The food was great , I got the burger, it was well cooked and tasted amazing. The cons are the staff, they are nice and mean well but lack some if the foresight needed. We were brought our drinks, straws came 5 minuets later. Got our meals and asked for ketchup, I was finished with my burger before the ketchup got to the table. This place has potential and I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"We visited for our first time last friday for food and karaoke. We had a wonderful waiter who took great care of us. We really enjoyed the good..I had the boss burger which is to die for and my boyfriend had the chicken vesuvio which he seemed to really enjoy....we aldor had the sliders for an appetizer which were some of the best sliders I've had, really enjoyed the avacado on them! The restaurant was very busy but we did have reservations and were sat immediately. I definitely recommend giving them a try and  its a good idea to make reservations if you go on Friday or Saturday. I'm excited to them grow as a restaurant and look forward to coming back!   ****my previous review was deleted, why I am not sure****  I went back again this past Sunday for the 71 American Idol contest. Our server was Shelly and she was amazing!! Even though it was extremely busy, our drinks and food were brought out in great time and the burger was delicious. This restaurant has made a lot of improvements since first opening and is well worth a visit if you have not been back. Overall it has a great atmosphere and they make you feel like your family every visit."}
{"text":"My family has been to the 71 every day since it opened.  Each visit, the restaurant was packed!  It's no mystery as to why.  The burgers were the best, salmon was excellent, mac and cheese is to die for, queso dip is wonderfully unique, and the breakfast omelets were very tasty.  We did not have any service issues and found the wait staff to be very attentive.  Treva is the BEST!  We are very much looking forward to trying everything on the menu.  Looks like Vistancia finally has a winner."}
{"text":"We were here the third night it opened, the food was just ok nothing spectacular and nothing horrible. The service was ok but that's expected and I'm sure it will get better however the $13.00 attempt at the bully dog was a failure it is very small and sour. An some of the prices on the food were a little high for what it is . Frankly I miss blu agave this is an ok attempt at a restaurant  $70 for two people for sharing a dinner n 2 apps a beer n bully seemed really high may return for a drink not for dinner"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, we really wanted to like this.  The good....our server was trying her best and remained polite and nice despite difficult circumstances (everyone in her section was unhappy because of the long wait.  We could also hear our neighbor tables complaining and returning food to be re-heated, etc.)  The bad.....everything else.  The water tasted HORRIBLE - bring your own.  My husband went to the store next door and bought us all bottled waters.  After an hour, my Miami Midnight sandwich came out quite literally charred black on all sides.  How a chef/cook plated that and sent it out is beyond me.  The Angry Chicken Sandwich was 2 small frozen breaded chicken tenders (aka Costco) sandwiched between 2 large pieces of white toast and unceremoniously slathered with buffalo sauce. So little care and thought put into the food.  In fact the chef said to one customer who thought his mac 'n cheese was too salty, \"well, that table over there ordered it and they like it\".  Really???!!!  The menu is weak  and doesn't make sense.  There are also no veggie or fruit side options.  I would even consider giving it a second chance but after talking to several other patrons with similar experiences, we won't be back. Sooooooo disappointed."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast.  Indifferent waitress delivered coffee in filthy cups.  (Blue chunks of something all over thee cups along with old drip marks on the cup!) YUCK! She put napkins down, which were all soaked in spilled coffee.  Had to ask her for new ones. Had to ask for water which arrived in equally dirty glasses. Water was never resupplied.  Food arrived w no butter on toast, no salt and pepper provided, scrambled eggs burned, and no jam provided.  Food was awful!  Omelette had raw runny eggs.  Bacon tasted like it sat in a bin of grease.    Waitress never came back to check on anything despite only having a few customers - you could count the customers on one hand. No surprise given our experience.)  Sadly the hope for a good local restaurant went down the drain along with our appetites at this dump."}
{"text":"I was very glad to see they were opening a new restaurant in Vistancia. I love supporting our neighborhood and 71 will help us do that. I've been twice since opening night and will be back again for sure. Opening night the service was a little rough but that is to be expected. I was a chef and have worked in the food industry and can say opening nights, week even is just to work on all your kinks. The second time I went back was much smoother and our server Marc was much more attentive and knowledgeable than the lady the first night.  For food we all ended up getting the \"Build a Burger\"s. Very impressive and price is very fair as well. Fries were awesome and the toppings/Ciabatta buns were great. Nice atmosphere as well, had some live singing which wasn't too loud like some places and the patio is going to be great on nice evenings!  They have a rather decent size wine and beer list. All the normal ones you would expect from the Macro-brew companies like Budweiser and Coors and a good size handful of craft beers as well. This is the one are I would like to say wasn't the best. While it was nice to have a large selection, none of the craft brews were that great. I'd say one of the biggest categories of craft brews is the IPA and they didn't have a single one. I recommend a good IPA on the menu and you could even weed out a few of the other options as I don't see them selling well from my past restaurant experience.   Overall we were all very impressed and will be regulars as long as service gets where it needs to be and I am confident it will with people like Marc. Solid food, solid prices, nice atmosphere and local. I really couldn't ask for much more, other than a good IPA please. :)"}
{"text":"We've been here nearly every week since its been open because it's what every family owned local restaurant should aspire to be. The owners have a Facebook page where they have responded to requests and feedback as earnestly as they could. They have been thoughtful with the good, drinks and weekly activities to keep us coming back for more. My 6 and 8 year old boys LOVE coming for kids karaoke on Wed nights. Burgers and fries are excellent, the salmon is my favorite! But I do agree with a couple reviewers that appetizers could be improved upon. I love that they endeavor to make changes to meet suggestions from customers and we can't wait to join them for breakfast at some point! Sure glad they're here for those \"we have nothing planned for dinner\" nights!  Service can be a little all over the place, but the food is fantastic and its an all around great local!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to 71 for our \"date night\" last Monday evening.  What a fantastic experience!  We were greeted at the door and taken to our seats immediately.  Our server was very good.  The best part was the food though!  My wife ordered the mac and cheese and was really happy with it.  I had the classic burger and it was one of the best I ever had.  Awesome fries!  We are really excited that they are open and can't wait to go back!  Jason"}
{"text":"After hearing that there was going to be a traditional American style restaurant in Vistancia, I thought \"well it's about time\". Then I heard that it was a local Vistancia resident, even more genius. Just what this community needs! The owner was spot on with this place. From the concept, to the food, to the pricing, and events. The owners really did an excellent job with this, well thought out. I waited till the buzz of the place went down and took myself and 2 kids in on thier family night along with my friend and her two kids since our husbands were working late. We were seated quickly by the hostess and given menus right away for the kids to play with. I ordered the steak & blue cheese salad and the kids ordered \"Kraft\" Mac n cheese and the other ordered mini corn dogs. Both served with large portions of fries. Now let me tell you the portions were AMAZING here with everything and the prices were so affordable! The fam could go eat and not feel bad about it. How does that ever happen??? It does here!!! Now this was my misjudgment however the the server took care of this no problem at the end but I thought it was \"kids eat free\" but it's \"kids eat free, 1 per adult meal purchased\" my mistake but she took care of both my kids meals kindly. Which I thought was great of her. So great food, good portions, and outstanding pricing and it's local and we are supporting our local economy as well as the place hiring local Vistancia residents. I think it really is a win win here. I had over all a great experience with my food at the restaurant! I cannot WAIT for the ice cream parlor to open!!! Ill defiantly be heading back to try other things, such as the \"boss\" burger I think it's called? I had a friend of mine come tell me about it and she said, \"it was the best burger I've ever had\" and she's not a huge burger person. Overall I think this place will be here for the long run. It's just what Vistancia has needed! I'm excited to see it stay for years to come and grow to know our family."}
{"text":"I was really excited for the new restaurant to open especially since it is owned and operated by local Vistancia residents.  However, I am disappointed that the owners did not take into consideration that Vistancia's main attraction to current and future residents is an active lifestyle with our many community pools, hiking, running, and biking trails, golf courses, and tennis courts.  It would have been nice to see some healthy alternatives to all of the fried foods, burgers, and fattening desserts on the menu. The atmosphere and menu are reminiscent of a greasy spoon diner you would find on Route 66 (with none of the charm) rather than a restaurant catering to an upscale neighborhood with modern families intent on raising healthy and active kids.    It is nice to see that the new owners have a lot of special events planned such as Karoke, Ladies Night, Live Music, and Line Dancing. But, it does make me uncomfortable to see the establishment place an equal amount of emphasis on adult events and  \"family atmosphere\".   I can't figure out if this is a gathering place for adults to drink, smoke, and sing off key (yes, smoking is allowed in the outside dinning area) or if this is a place for children to run around amped up on Kraft Mac and Cheese, and white rolls with cinnamon butter.   Lakeside and Squid Ink are better choices for adult entertainment and Smashburger and Chili's have better burgers with healthy options."}
{"text":"Opening night. Will the restaurant be on their game? Will months of planning and preparing equal culinary excellence and a service masterpiece? Or will it mean that they will begin with a bang only to fizzle out 6 months later. I can't speak to much on the last part but I will tell you for certain that 71 American Grille was on their game in terms of culinary excellence on their opening night. Their service, on the other hand, was lacking. They were the first to recognize this so I am going to factor that out of the equation for now and concentrate on the rest of the experience.  When I was perusing the Vistancialive.com forums a short while ago and spied the announcement of a restaurant opening in my neighborhood, I was elated to say the least. We were in desperate need of a good family restaurant and Grande Pizza (R.I.P) really wasn't creating that experience. I watched as 71's media rep coordinated an online presence and gave us the count down to opening day. Friends were contacted, reservations were made, we were there with our appetites at the ready.  The menu was pretty non surprising with burgers, sandwiches, salads, and so on but that is exactly what I wanted to see. I built a burger with cheese and bacon. Nothing fancy to start with. I needed to see if their basic burger was going to represent them well. The other couple we were with also built a burger while my wife ordered the turkey burger. I first want to applaud their use of non standard buns. It was a crustier ciabatta type roll that keep the burger where the burger should be. The burger was good. Really good. Not only was it cooked to my direction but you could tell the meat they were using was quality as well. Great flavor, not too big, not too small, not too greasy, just what you wanted type of burger. Everybody else at the table agreed. And this place actually makes a good turkey burger! I may have only had 2 bites but even my wife concurred with its superior flavor to anything else she has had. Added bonus, the fries were excellent. Thin cut, fried just right, and plenty of them. That meal definitely passes the test.  I will just come out and say it, I wanted a bar close enough to my house that I could walk. I am not saying I want to get drunk enough to fight the coat rack and walk home but I want to have some beers and be safe. With that said, the beer selection was a little of a let down. I am far from a beer connoisseur but I have been more involved with my beer selections in the past few years. All the domestics are covered on draft but the bottled variety is lacking. Again, possibly freshman exploratory choices but when craft beers is listed as a feature of the restaurant I usually expect more of selection than was provided.  Overall, I am happy and excited about 71 American Grille. My second visit last night for drinks with friends was a much better service experience than the first time. 71 really has an opportunity to grab the attention of everyone in the community and are pretty much the only game in town for what they are offering. Grande Pizza in the same center wasn't able to make it but I think 71 has a good shot at being the go to place for hungry, busy families in the neighborhood. I know my family just put them at the top of the list, and I hope the staff stays on their game to keep it that way."}
{"text":"Oh man I wanted to love this place so much.  After we lost the Kalahari, then the good Blu Agave.  But, alas, it is not to be.  Vistancia's residents deserve better.  Decoration is red, white and blue painted walls, two wooden country store flags, some very rigid upright seating in booths, extremely wrinkled red drapes  and tables covered with glass that seal travel memorabilia.  The food--eh.  I had their main American burger.  Nothing special.  A patty of beef on a ciabatta roll, three pickles, one slice of American cheese and one piece of dried up bacon.  nothing juicy or special for $8.  Hubby had the shrimp and a Caesar salad @$5 and $8.  The salad was huge and just ok.  The shrimp were horrid.  Right out of a box in the supermarket.  Little dried up shrimp that fell out of a cardboard bland tasting batter.  Ugh.....  We had a groupon and didn't even make the amount of money.  I thought they were marketing this place with desserts and ice cream.  There were five desserts.  That's it and not an ice cream shake or sundae among them.  The place has its main faults though in its menu.  so limiting with just sports bar quality food and items.  the local Outback has better choices.  one steak, one salmon dish, one pork chop dish, four salads, five burgers, and some appetizers and thats about it.  Bar had three people just sitting there watching the many games on the tv's with their beers.  The place is not inviting or gives you any feeling of wanting to be there.  Sadly, we will not be returning.  Such a shame maybe four will be the charm cause #3 is not!"}
{"text":"Yelp, I really resent you filtered my review.  Those who follow me will tell you I give honest reviews, and I've had one bad and three good experiences here.  If you don't want my reviews, you got it!!!!"}
{"text":"The Boss Burger is my favorite menu item at this place. The first time I was here, it was served on a square ciabatta bun, and the second time I was here, it was on a round ciabatta bun, which confused me. There is a slice of salami on top of the burger meat along with caramelized onions and provolone cheese. I always add mushrooms as well even though it is not an option on the menu, and they are always willing to accommodate my request, which I am grateful for.  The Hawaiian poke appetizer has no business being on a diner menu but I order it each time because it's good. I love the fresh tuna combined with avocado and the rest of the poke mix. The wonton crisps that separate each layer compliment the poke quite well.   My husband always orders the Green Chili Burger Patty Melt, and he enjoys it thoroughly. I only managed a small bite of his, so I didn't really have a chance to truly remember how it tasted but I imagine it's good, otherwise the picky guy wouldn't keep ordering it.   There's a Cajun mac and cheese appetizer as well, but it kind of reminded us of Kraft mac and cheese that comes from a box. Despite it's unimpressive appearance in comparison to the other stuff we've tried, it's pretty tasty with the andouille sausage mixed in.   As far as desserts go, the carrot cake is good. The sizzling apple skillet is basically a slice of apple pie that's very hot and topped with ice cream, so don't expect a skillet. It's also good, because apple pie is always good, especially when topped with ice cream.  There is a trend in every paragraph I'm describing... the food is good!   I find it funny that despite the fact that people in our Vistancia community want this restaurant location to be successful, the reviews are often harsh and emotion-filled. There is evident frustration that with so many restaurants opening and closing at this location, our community's voices are not being heard. If complaints are not addressed immediately, then people are willing to let it fail so quickly.   I can tell that this restaurant is trying to address these complaints.  - A new healthier option menu was created - They are trying to appeal to families as well (there were families with children taking free line dancing lessons on the \"bar\" side of the wall) - Service is typically really good Sunday through Thursday (with the exception of a weekend night and short staffing issues - can't help there...)  Some areas for improvement..  -Don't advertise about an ice cream/fountain shoppe if it's not ready yet. Just surprise us or give us a date when it'll open because people are let down when they don't see it and think it's there already - Excited for website to be done anytime soon! There are no pictures showing off the food on the website and there should be as well as all the great specials you guys are having. (I know, I know, it's a work in progress still...)  Like many others, I do honestly want this grill to succeed. Yeah the decor is perhaps \"colder\" than the warm desert colors from the previous restaurant, but you got to admit, the themed state table idea was pretty cool. It's fun to sit at different tables and see what's unique about each state. That's one of the reasons reservations are available.. so you can pick what \"state\" you want to sit at. Plus, the food is good. I just hope that with the summer coming around, some small improvements can be made that every new restaurant faces initially and everyone can finally be on the same page for once."}
{"text":"We ate at the 71 American Grill for the third time last night during their grand opening. As a local resident we really want this place to succeed. The first two times we came I had the burgers, which were great and the service, particularly the friendliness of the staff was outstanding. Last night I went with the special Fried Chicken and it was very disappointing. The chicken pieces were more the size of a Cornish game hen. The three small pieces were barely enough to get a taste. My wife didn't even get any white meat. It appeared to be a thigh, a drumstick and a back piece. When she complained the waiter was very helpful and brought another piece of chicken.  Restaurant in this area typically have a short life and if this place is going to survive it needs to have good food. I will come again, but I would hesitate to order anything other than the burger"}
{"text":"today was the 3rd time i've been to 71, and just haven't had time to write a review.  Today we had the Easter Brunch, the food was amazing, and was definitely plenty of it.  the Custom Omelet bar was a bit weak on add-ons, but what they had tasted amazing!    The other 2 times i went i had Queso Dip (really flavorful and good), Sliders w/avacado (can be a meal), Green Chilli Melt Burger & Grilled cheese with a twist.  Everything i've eaten was really good and definitely worth the price.  The inside is nicely laid out and wasn't too loud.  We sat outside 2 weeks ago and enjoyed it (although now with it being an open patio it will be a bit hot).  Overall i'm fan and will definitely be going back, a few more things on the menu i can't wait to try!"}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day brunch. It was a great experience. Not very crowded. We got complimentary flowers. The staff was friendly and the buffet was really good. Overall a good experience. Plus it is close to my parents house. They lack restaurants in this area so I hope this one stays open."}
{"text":"Average service and below average food.  I ordered a burger cooked medium, but it came horribly undercooked. My wife ordered a salad, and the lettuce was noticeably brown and wilted. Really hard to believe they thought it was OK to let that bowl of brown, dead leaves out of the kitchen.  The staff was friendly, and our server asked if he could bring us new meals but we didn't have much faith that anything else would have been any better.  We likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad at all. Happy hour prices are good, discounted beer and appetizers. Service was great.  Really friendly bartender,very efficient, personable.  I'll be back for this alone. The poke tuna app is really good.  The fish was tasty and sauce was really good too. The mini corn dog app is... mini corn dogs.  It's listed to be served with a mango ketchup, but if thats what we got it is indiscernible from regular ketchup. They are served with some potato chips, regular bagged chips, nothing special at all here. Finally we shared the queso dip. No real spice or kick, just cheese really. Again, not exciting.  So, I am deffinently willing to go back, planning on it even. I want to try something off of the regular menu, maybe I'll have more luck there, as the apps (excluding the poke) seem to be lacking.  And the friendly service, and clean space, make it a good laid back spot for a cocktail."}
{"text":"First time with an open mind: poor quality of food was not exactly what explained on the menu (clam cake, all beef brisket, patty melt, Cajun mac n cheese), great service, drinks, atmosphere  ... I wouldn't recommend it for eating but just for drinks. Hopefully things will change."}
{"text":"Raw eggs in my salad. Hmmm.  I was really disappointed this time around.  We usually love coming here but I don't know what's going on. We told the waitress and nobody seemed to really care. Oh well."}
