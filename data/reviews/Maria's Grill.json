{"text":"Let me see, frist off the service was slow and had an attitude. Second the home fries was a baked potato cut  up. Thirdly the waffle and french toast was burnt to the point my kids wouldn't eat them. Fourth and last, when we went to live the coast was high, when I asked why,  I was told what I was charged for, they added two cheeses to my ticket that we didn't have. But before she took the time to tell me why she had put it on my card. I paid for food we didn't get! Will never go back!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast, it wasn't spectacular but it was good enough for the prices, i'd rather this than ihop.  It's no Jersey diner but we will come back."}
{"text":"Cool spot....cheap good food CIAA babby"}
{"text":"I have to totally agree with Thomas B.
 Maria's could use a little design style upgrade but the owners and employees are always nice and the food is affordable,  good, and ample amounts are served. I eat here often."}
{"text":"The food was so good and I was so hungry, I forgot to take a pic before I indulged. It's not a fancy place but the staff was pleasant and food was great. I ordered the fried flounder breakfast special with grits, home fries and wheat toast. My boyfriend ordered the French toast breakfast special with bacon and grits. The portions were way bigger than I expected. You get a lot of food for your money. My meal came with two large pieces of flounder and I ended up taking 1.5 pieces home with me because I was so full. The grits were thick and buttery just like I like them. I am from NJ and this place reminds me a NJ diner so I will definitely be returning. I look forward to trying their lunch options but for now I will stick to the breakfast."}
{"text":"Run by the wife of the guy who owns Tryon House. Very similar (probably identical) style of food.

In my experiences as a kid at Tryon House, the breakfast was great, and the lunch/dinner was hit or miss depending on what you got. And it seems like that carries over here.

Came in for lunch after church. We started our meal off with complementary chicken and rice soup. I wasn't really a fan, it was a tad salty for my taste, and it was definitely on the oily side. Can't beat free though, so it's not an issue for me.

For an entree, I got the patty melt with a side of fries. The burger was very simple and straightforward, just double patties on grilled rye with melted provolone cheese and some grilled onions.  It was executed really well, though, and was definitely the highlight of the meal for me. The meat was seasoned and cooked well, the bread was crispy, and the cheese was just the right amount of gooey and melty. The onions could've stood a little bit more caramelization, but they were by no means bad. And the patties themselves were nice and thick, so much so that I was able to save half for tomorrow.

The fries were tasty, dusted liberally with Cajun seasoning. But they were right at the edge of being underdone. Again, not bad enough to not eat them, but they probably could've withstood another minute in the fryer and been really good.

All in all, if you like Tryon House, you'll probably like this, and vice-versa. Good food for the price, excellent wait staff, but temper expectations.

Also - avoid the mac n' cheese. Tried a bite from someone else's plate. SUPER bland. Like KFC if it wasn't seasoned at all."}
{"text":"A nice diner.  Nothing more, but nothing less.  There is nothing fancy about this place so temper your expectations.  But that isn't to say it isn't good.  The place is clean, the staff is friendly, the food arrives quickly, hot, and tasty.  The prices match the quality of food and that is fine.  Places don't have to be extravagant to be good in my book.  

I would definitely recommend the place for a quick breakfast, or a casual lunch with many options.  Just don't expect anything to blow you away.  But for the price of the menu items that is fine by me."}
{"text":"Took the boys out for breakfast and enjoyed my time. Great people who talked to my boys more than me. Always there with the coffee and a smile. Only reason not five stars because of the rolling chairs. Little tricky for a 5 and 4 yr old."}
{"text":"Horrible my mom and I went there the waitress gave us an attitude and my God did not come back till 1 hour and a half later the food delicious the customer service horrible"}
{"text":"Maria is VERY rude!! I wont spend my money where im not appreciated... I was charged for something that I had no clue about.. She says why order it if your not going to eat it! I will NEVER step foot in that place again!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of a dive, with the food to match.  It wasn't horrible, but definitely not the best.  The saving grace for it was the people.  I wonder why it is that the small little places like this that you never really notice have the friendliest employees.  Everyone was super nice and I never had to ask for anything because the waitress took care of it.  It was a pleasant experience, but I probably won't be seeking this place out."}
{"text":"The staff was really nice but it was too hot for the July heat. The food lack seasoning."}
{"text":"We had a great Mother's Day breakfast at Maria's Grill. The service was fantastic, quick and friendly. The portions are huge and all of the food was good. This is not a gourmet place, but it is really good American food. I'm only giving it 4 stars because the menu is not very imaginative for breakfast anyway. A great place to go if you are hungry!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving this 1 star is bc the people are super nice here; however the food is pretty gross. I will come here with some coworkers.  The Maria special breakfast is ok. I think it's a hit bc it's so much food and so cheap.
I ventured out and got lunch today. Worst choice all day. I got chicken tenders. Disgusting. They were so over cooked and the texture was that of a fried fish. I honestly could not eat it if I tried. Personally I will not come here again. It's overrated with the local people as a \"staple\"."}
{"text":"Good if you are in a pinch, but nothing spectacular. The prices are very good and the service was pretty good. Some people love quantity over quality... I could bump it up another star if they add a little seasoning, plus invest in some decent syrup for the pancakes. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always hot. Old fashioned breakfast at its finest. Great food prices."}
{"text":"Oh Marias It is what it is. A pretty decent breakfast for decent breakfast prices. I just want more from them. Nothing stands out. I have eaten their several times for breakfast and lunch and its a diner with diner fare. I love gyros and this could be a real Greek based diner,but alas its not. I get a gyro kit from Aldi s that is better. For shame. Hopefully they will see this review and venture to stand out amongst the crowd. Wait staff gets kudos."}
{"text":"Whenever I can, I enjoy having breakfast at Maria's.  I have never had a bad meal or menu item.  The service is friendly and the wait staff treats you like family.  I highly recommend the Spanish Omelette and biscuits."}
{"text":"Great diner, reminds me of New York! Food is good and great portions... The service is always great... Anyone looking for a diner style place, this is the place."}
{"text":"Just moved to this neck of the woods to the Rockwell Park-Hemphill Heights area, and I see this place on my work during the week.  Always has traffic so I figured it'd a cool place.  Wrong...

I ordered the veggie omelette with cheese, with home fries and a Belgium waffle.  The veggies were pale and obviously frozen and the cheese was a slice of barely warm american cheese.  The potatoes were chewy and tasted like old grease.  

They weren't home fries at all, they were just potatoes.  No seasoning, no peppers, no onions.  Blahhhhh.

The waffle was soggy af too....

Worst decision I've  made all day  

1 star for location."}
{"text":"I ventured into the neighborhood looking for another breakfast joint.  Parking is easy as was getting seated.  The restaurant was clean and efficient, and my review echos Kendra F., who wrote, \"Oh, Marias, It is what it is.\"  It's a decent, neighborhood restaurant serving up basic meals to a modest, diverse clientele.  

I enjoyed their daily breakfast special of fried white fish.  Mmmm.  Took me back to the Saturday market in Marigot, Saint Martin's where whole fried fish and Johnny Cakes were gobbled as fast as the fryer could make 'em.  Maria's made them very well, too.  Nice little place I won't hesitate to visit next time I'm near."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service and a great price for a hot meal as opposed to fast food.  Spacious rooms on both sides of the diner and the waitresses remember the customers that frequent the establishment.  Perfect location at Derita Plaza in the University area of Charlotte for people that work in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place. Wish they would spend some money on updating the restroom though. The smell takes away any appetite. The wait staff & hostess are super friendly and we have never had to wait to be seated. A lot of people get to go orders so don't be surprised by all the people standing or seated inside the doors. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place, service is great food is as ordered and prices reasonable.  I would give it 5 stars except the gyro is bad, pre formed dried out slices with very little flavor.  I would expect more from a greek owned place.   Ill be back for sure just order some other stuff."}
{"text":"Breakfast is always great! Big portions for reasonable prices. Service is always good! Very nice servers.  Not a fancy looking place but I can overlook because of the taste!"}
{"text":"Meat and two place. Pretty decent food. Great service. Divey."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant.  The staff treats everyone like family. I've been coming here for about 3 years and I've never had a bad meal. Excellent place to meet friends for breakfast. It might be time to update the decor but no real complaints from me."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience here. The food is good and the staff is friendly. They have specials daily for breakfast. If you are looking for a good breakfast spot with reasonable prices, Maria Grill is the spot"}
{"text":"Basic food cooked okay nice portions great staff - we dine here often - I've only had breakfast but good value overall"}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting this restaurant, I got the 2 pancake meal and it exceeded my expectations. Prices are very reasonable and you get a lot of food, I couldn't even finish my entire meal. The waitress was so nice and very helpful with a food recommendation as I had never been there before. Definitely will go back soon and try the shrimp."}
{"text":"I ate here today with my mother and was expecting something amazing since the parking lot was so full. We arrived to a dated diner with chairs that had wheels on them. The decor screamed 1980s but in my gut i said this food must be amazing because it is a lot of people here. The wait staff was nice but extremely slow. It took at least 20 min to just get beverage. The prices here are right on the money of being low due to the quality of food. I order the smoked sausage  with grits cheese eggs and toast. The smoked sausage was tasty. I added a salmon patties with sliced tomatoes. Can you believe that a side of tomatoes is $2 bucks but heck i hope i got the entire tomato for that. It took almost a hour to get our food  which was a bit of a wait for the type of food we order. My tea and coffee at that point was cold. The waitress did get our order wrong but it was quickly corrected.  The salmon patty were gross it appeared to have green peppers in it and it was deep fired. Not what i expected.The food was average. If the waitress and check out process was better i would have given a 3 star. This place only have one register for all order.  People were waiting out the door just to pay their tabs.I had to wait an additional 15 min just to check out. I will try it again but maybe e as a takeout."}
{"text":"First time diner, Lori our server was very helpful and gave great service.  We don't live far from here, but because of the not so great reviews we have never tried it. 
We were pleasantly surprised at how much of the food was homemade. Our expectations were sort of low going in.
We were pleasantly surprised that the food was pretty good for the price."}
{"text":"First off, can you please clean the windows!! i mean damm the staff is sweet but can you take PRIDE! In your bussiness? the decor is nothing but silly, i mean old tractor trailers above the doorway that havent been cleaned in YEARS! I have eaten in alot of hole in the wall places all over but i mean the first thing that turns me off is dirty place were you expect me to eat.  it also needs a extreme makeover.but the food is good! lol Maria its time to step your game up!"}
{"text":"Maria's reminds me of grandmas.  It's not contemporary at all but to me that just added to the southern comfort with the food to come!  Went here for breakfast/lunch after church and left pretty full!  The staff was very nice and informative, considering I was so indecisive about what I wanted to eat.  The menu is so lengthy, I had a hard time choosing.  I eventually went with the three meat omelet with grits and biscuits and I was very pleased with my choice.  The prices were also pretty hard to beat!  You definitely get a lot of food for the money!  I'd go back again and again to try the different items on their menu!  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Country Fried Steak for the win... the coffee is local and its delicious."}
{"text":"A damn good breakfast, is exactly what this place has. Makes you think your in the country of NC somewhere even though your right here in Charlotte. The breakfast can rival any Ihop, Waflle House, Cracker barrel etc."}
{"text":"After living in the vicinity of this restaurant four years, today I finally decided to check out this dining facility with my wife. This place is quaint with the furniture and walls beckoning for an update. The waitress was friendly. I ordered the salmon patty & eggs and my wife ordered a vegetable omelette. Both of us ordered the home fries. Everything was good, and service by the waitress was average. Total dining experience was average. We may come back in the future after our somewhat positive experience. Next time I will try the grits with my salmon patty."}
