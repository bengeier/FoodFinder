{"text":"Service is slow Food is good though Only one selection of sides , fries."}
{"text":"Ok Ok--this place is ok, not stupendous by any means but decent. The place is a little walk-up resto on a side street in downtown Montreal. Please note--and this is important--it is CASH only. They have an ATM machine in the resto but its a white-label one that charges you $1.50 to withdraw, and you're bank will also charge you at least another $1.50 but BRING CASH. Many patrons find this out only after having ordered their burger and they're forced to make the trek to the bank machine even though they'd really rather not. Anyways to the food. The burgers are DRY, like not juicy goodness like you'd hope but well-done, cooked a little too long, and DRY, let me emphasize DRY. you need to put condiments on there. My boyfriend and I spread garlic mayonnaise on the bun and that made a world of a difference. I agree with another reviewer who says you cannot--I repeat, cannot--taste the caramelized onions. So don't thing those will hold you over, you'll need to pony up the dough and add something from the optional menu. I suggest a cheese--brie is nice, etc. etc.--and probably bacon, just to add to the flavour (which is, quite honestly, lacking).   The burgers are much better at a chain restaurant like Harvey's. I know know the hipster side of me is scolding me for encouraging people to go to a corporate behemoth like Harvey's, but truth be told their burgers really are much better (and they're grilled; not microwaved like McDonald's). This place is nice for a different burger experience; it is definitely higher end than a typical Harvey's location, for example. As others have noted be prepare to wait wait wait. Today there was a group of 5 people in front of us and literally took us 20 minutes to get our burgers. Yes, 20 minutes. You can phone ahead and they'll place you're order for you in advance and then you can pick it up, but often I'm not planning in advance to go to a burger place. I just wanna walk in, order, and eat soon after ordering. This is not an option here. You will have to wait, longingly looking at your fellow diners as they chow down.   SO: why the three stars? I like the fries, and the different kinds of mayo available. They have spicy mayo, wasabi mayo, garlic mayo, regular mayo ... and another one which I forget at the moment. But I highly recommend the spicy mayo. If the pumps do not work, just ask the associate and he/she will provide with you a small container of it. The pumps are often out of commission so be prepared to ask. Also, the homemade lemonade is phenomenal. Today, not so much, a little watered down, but usually its amazing. I would definitely order the lemonade over any other beverage available. Also, you can spike the lemonade with vodka (its a licensed restaurant). This is always a good option if you're visiting/on vacation, stopping in before a night out on the town.   This restaurant is good for those who are staying in hotels in the area: Le Centre Sheraton, the Marriott, etc. because its close to the hotel, and its not outrageously expensive (I think my burger, fries, and drink was $12 which, while a little pricey for what its worth, is not too too bad). Maybe you'll have a better experience with your burger and pay the price to dress it up, but I was underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Le Gourmet Burger is a small place (max. seating ~25), but surprisingly delicious. If you are looking for a quick bite of quality burger at an inexpensive place, Le Gourmet Burger is for you.  I picked up a coupon for a free drink (Found at www.restomontreal.ca). The amount of options for your burger also means that you can discover a new flavour everytime you go in. I ordered a Bison burger (where else can you get a Bison burger this quickly?) with sweet potato fries. Food is cooked right in front of you, and I was impressed from what I saw. Fresh meat patties placed on grilled, buns toasted, and fries were dropped into the deep-fryer as they were ordered. My burger was cooked medium. Juices were dripping onto my tray as I took each bite. Fries were also cooked right (very crispy, and not burned). Overall, a very good burger joint near Concordia where students can enjoy a good burger for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Let's think a little bit. If you walk into a small restaurant offering burgers, with either beef, chicken, or game meat, along with any toppings of your choice, is it fair to order a bacon cheeseburger & call it average? Reviewing Gourmet burger on such logic is like juding a cocktail bar based on its Rum & Coke  This place is awesome! I trusted the guy at the grill, who made me a cream cheese-hummus-bacon burger. It was... incredible. My girlfriend said I was disgusting for ordering such things, until she tried it. She's been wanting to go back ever since.  The fries are also fantastic, easily the best sweet potato fries i've ever had.  Finally, this is one of the few places that serves old-school style floats, a hard find in Montreal.  Considering all the snobby burger places in Montreal, this joint just keeps it real."}
{"text":"Waited ages for a burger, at least 45 minutes, when we got them our patties were burnt, thin and terrible. Fries were delicious but would never go there again. Service was atrocious and burgers were worst than McDonald's but twice the price... Not recommended at all"}
{"text":"Saw some reviews, yes occasionally the service can be iffy, however for a couple of bucks more than Mcdonalds, the food is fantastic, and the sweet potato fries rock."}
{"text":"PRICE: overpriced for the quality of food the restaurant has purchased.   AMBIENCE: This restaurant is pretty looking. With bright green walls and exposed brick, the grill is right in plain view and adds a nice hint of steel to the place.    but it was ICE COLD IN THERE!  i never took off my coat and wished I coulda kept on my gloves.   The floor was dusty and gross.   They do not serve their food on plates. just small foil squares about 4 inches by 4 inches (the burger takes up the whole square.)  STAFF: super nice. college type kids. just two staff. Welcoming.   FOOD:  I WANTED: a chicken burger, but at 6pm when we came in they \"had no more chicken left\"   WE HAD:   *one beef burger with lettuce, tomato, cheddar, a fried egg, & guacamole. *one beef burger with lettuce, tomato, cheddar, bacon, eggplant & pickles. *poutine *regular fries.  -- soggy burnt fries ( i know what you are thinking \"that sounds like a mind fuck\"  but it happened) -- the poutine was about the worst part of the meal. The cheese curds came in a plastic bag, ripped open and poured onto our gravy.   --The one burger with the 2 giant long-sliced pickles on it was drippy! with what I DONT know?! The other didnt drip.   Growing up around the food industry, I am able to  tell how much quality of work was put into it a restaurant. I could tell the owner of this very small establishment purchases the lowest quality of materials he or she can find.  I would never go back. Not for a $33 meal."}
{"text":"Lovely place, friendly and fast service, juicy burger, and the mixed potato cone was outstanding. If you like to try new flavours, ask for the wasabi mayo!"}
{"text":"I just love it .. Nice place easy location and good customer service . It's amazing that I can eat my own selection of the most delicious hamburger ever  If you like your burger with eggs this is the place"}
{"text":"- GREAT burgers: meat is flavorful and condiments are perfect (not too much and not too little).  - GREAT fries: although both regular and sweet fries are delicious... the sweet potato fries win this battle. BUT...  Terrible service! I found the staff to be rude (all) of the times I went. What kept me going back after the first time was seriously the food because their employees seem to have a lack of people skills. If you have a question about the menu, a question in general or even speak...just don't. Place is a little too small to sit, but since the staff isn't the friendliest anyway...just take it to go!"}
{"text":"Clean and focused; that's what I love about this place. Especially at lunch, you want a good burger and just enough fries to reach the cusp of a carb coma. Additional bonus points for those quad-size ketchup packets!  What has taken down my rating - and prompted this update - is that the quality has stepped down a bit over time. The wait is getting longer. Group orders virtually close down the restaurant. They don't take debit. Half the time, the bun is overbaked, resembling a softened stone.  The veggies are becoming inconsistent. You have to ask for their specialty sauces.   Simply put, this is a 3-star burger with 2-star order requirements, and I can only give one rating. So I'm going with this one, but if you think more highly, I won't blame you. At times, it's one of the best burgers in Montreal. But for my $10+ lately I think I'd rather take a shot with Cheeburger."}
{"text":"I'm a big burger lover!!!  and this place rocks!!!  It's tiny, and a bit stuffy on a hot night, but otherwise the burgers here are delish!!!  It's sort of an itemized menu, where you pick the burger, beef chicken or veggie, it comes with a bun tomatoes and caramelised onions.  you add what you want to customize, like mushroom, cheese, foie gras, nuts, eggs, red peppers and other stuff i can't remember. In short there's something for everyone, sweet, salty whatever you like.  extras range from 1-2$ to 5$ like foie gras.  regular condiments like ketchup and mustard are free, including a few special sauces, hmm hmm, like wasabi mayo, garlic mayo, spicy mayo, bbq sauce and special gourmet burger sauce. all free!!! and self serve.  On the sides, they have fries, and sweet potato fries, for 3$, you can also have them mixed, half fries half sweet potato fries, the sweet potato fries are real good. They have salads too but i haven't tried it yet.   Honestly drinks are a gip, 3$, but you get a bottle, old school style. You can also add a scoop of ice cream to your soda, root beer float anyone?  Tried the brownie one time, it's crap, don't try it, it's stale and dry, ew for 3$ yikes.  All in all, decent place and decent price, runs about 10-18$ not highway robery like M burger. depending on what you get. burger fries and a drink will fill you up. Athough i wished they had grilled pineapple like M burger.  They have the buns made especially for them, it is brushed with sesame and honey, so it's a very nice bun. Tastes so good."}
{"text":"Ordered through Foodora. The burger was alright, can't complain. Nothing extraordinary though. However, the fries were seriously undercooked (several were actually raw, greyish color). Even worse, there was a hair in my fries. Good thing I started with the burger, or I would've never been able to eat this stuff."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch occasionally whenever I am craving a decent burger.  I usually get a beef burger with monterrey jack cheese, guacomole, bacon, and caramelized onions.  The beef is usually cooked alright and by adding the guacomole the burger doesn't require any condiments.  The sweet potato fries definitely complete the meal.    For food the rating I give is 4 stars.  However, I give it 3 stars due to the following reasons.  The place is small and has a limited amount of seats and gets crowded during lunch time.  It does take awhile to get your meal too.  You need to plan to spend awhile waiting.  Also, recently a lot of things haven't been working such as the condiment dispenser near the counter."}
{"text":"I want to begin by saying I was truly impressed by the staff here - they were fantastic. Welcoming, efficient, friendly and very considerate.   In terms of food quality - It was great. But of course one must realize I'm grading this based on it being a burger joint, not gourmet French cuisine.   I had the burger that was on special (Shriner burger). Not only did it taste great, but $1 from each sale is donated to the Shriners. The poutine was quite good too. Not the best I've had, but good.   Admittedly, it was the staff I was really impressed with and why I gave this place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Ce petit restaurant a de quoi tempérer les rages \"burguesques\", si je puis me permettre d'utiliser leur propre terme... Effectivement, cela faisait longtemps que je n'avais pas mangé un aussi bon burger... C'est définitivement une place pour ceux qui savent apprécier les bons mets (gourmet)... La confection du burger a été ici repensée, afin d'en tirer le meilleur pour la santé. Ce serait exagérer de dire qu'il s'agit de gastronomie, mais je ne peux pas non plus parler au nom de la malbouffe, d'autant plus que j'ai dû attendre une quinzaine de minutes avant de recevoir mon repas...et j'étais seul. Je voyais faire le cuisinier; il y mettait de l'attention; pendant qu'il caramélisait des oignons (inclus dans chaque burger), le pain brioche se réchauffait au four, et la viande, saupoudrée de fines herbes, grillait sur le charbon de bois... Quatre sortes de burger sont offerts : boeuf, poulet, végé-pâté et mini!...  Mon cheeseburger était franchement délectable. Une bonne variété de mayonnaises maison (épicée, ail, wasabi, etc.) se tient sur le comptoir à garniture pour accompagner les patates, qui sont frites dans l'huile de canola et servies dans des cornets, soutenus par une sorte de spirale métallique. Si vous avez envie de vivre une expérience gustative hors du commun, sachez qu'il est possible d'ajouter à son burger toutes sortes de condiments pour le moins raffinés, moyennant un extra variant entre 1$ et 5$ : foie gras, huile de truffe, fromage bleu, brie, formage de chèvre, boursin, St-Guillaume, pesto au piments rouges, noix de Grenoble, oeuf, bacon, hummus, etc. Les possibilités s'accroissent à un point tel qu'il est encore difficile de parler de vulgaires burgers de cantines.   On y sert également de la poutine, salades fraîches, brownies, et toutes sortes de breuvages, dont les fameux flotteurs ( boule de crème glacée sur une boisson gazeuse de votre choix)... Le restaurant a désormais son permis d'alcool. Vous pourrez accompagner votre burger d'un verre de...de vin?... Oui, oui!  Seul hic: il est malheureusement difficile de se faire servir en français... Qui plus est, le service est très bête."}
{"text":"I used a la carte for delivery (which is an excellent delivery service) however I was very disappointed in the quality of the food. I'm not usually one to write negative reviews, but this time i absolutely felt the need to do so. The iced tea tasted alcoholic, the fries were soggy and the quantity was so little it was ridiculous, the burger was acceptable since the beef tasted good but other than that it lacked flavor. I definitely won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"At first, you enter the place and it's got an IKEA-like decoration and a picture of a burger that can make your heart melt. Then, you sit down with your burger and fries and BOOM. You end up REALLY wishing you hadn't.  Meat is dry and boring. Almost overcooked. The people behind the counter when I went were absolutely horrible. Everything you want to add onto the burger costs a little bit extra.  My experience: I went with 2 other friends and we all got the classic burger. Then we got 2 servings of fries: Regular and sweet potatoes. The fries were HORRID. I normally prefer regular fries over the sweet potatoes by a long mile, and here, the outcome was the opposite. I'm pretty sure that if I squeezed the regular fries I could have made a canola oil company and sold a bottle from every half fry I squeezed.  Next, the burger: Dry, uninteresting and overcooked. Nothing more to add on that front.  I don't have much more to say about this place. They try to attract you with their fancy thin, inconvenient trays and swirl-design cups to store the fries but in reality this place has a TERRIBLE burger."}
{"text":"Please stay away from this expensive \"burger\". It made me sick. Our burger was burnt and no manager was on staff to help us out. No condiments, they even ran out of poutine sauce. Not to mention they constantly sent me the wrong order. For such an expensive burger I expected a good to decent burger. Not only was my burger inedible I paid over $10 for the burnt burger alone.  STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"Nette, kleine Location mit zwei Tischen und ein paar Barhockern an der Fensterscheibe. Während meines Aufenthaltes blickte ich da leider auf eine Baustelle, aber dafür kann der Laden nichts.  Für das Essen aber schon. Kurz: Ich hatte einen Burger (lecker) und Pommes (extrem fettig). Die Soße kann man sich aussuchen. Die miesen Pommes haben mir den Magen verstimmt, mein Kollege war klüger und hat sie gar nicht erst angerührt. Die Burger kann man aber essen. Mehr als drei Personen dürften es aufgrund der wenigen Sitzplätze aber schwer haben."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend when he recommended it. The place was pretty deserted and small but it was to be expected from a random \"fast\" food joint downtown.  I ordered a chicken burger with fries and I'd like to say that charging 1$ for a fucking slice of cheddar is NOT OK.  The food was above average (meat was fresh and cooked well and the fries tasted pretty good) but it was not worth the price. They gave me like 10-12 small curly french fries for 3$. I'm pretty sure I paid 4$ for the presentation. Which is pretty useless if you consider the appearance of the establishment.  What really pissed me off was the wait. 25 fucking minutes for 2 burgers and 2 small portions of fries? Really?   All-in-all, you could walk to M Burg down a few streets, pay a little more and get the best burger in town. Not worth it, there are better places.  Also love how they expect a tip before we're served even though there is barely any service."}
{"text":"The food is just amazing!  A burger is about $6 then you pay around $1 for whatever you want to add to the burger (bacon, pickle..).  $3 for fries and you have an option of regular fries, sweet potatoes or mixed! (I recommend the mixed one). $6 for poutines! (which are really good!) Drinks are $2-$3. I usually take a coke and for $1 more, I get a scoops of vanilla icecream added to it! (just amazing)!"}
{"text":"Came here for the poutineweek special. Overall, the taste was quite nice, although I found the BBQ sauce to be a bit overpowering and maybe out of place.  I also disliked the fact that this is a Pay-Before-You-Sit type of place, like a fast food joint, even though their menu is quite pricey.  Overall, a solid meal, but we felt a bit forgotten in the corner as we even had to go pick up our own food at the counter."}
{"text":"Very decent veggie burger option which consists of grilled vege pate. Great soda selection (including black cherry). Really like the sweet potato and regular potato mix option. Lots of original condiments as well as burger toppings and cheeses. The cost can add up really quick with the added toppings but the variety is fantastic. Was not incredibly impressed with their poutine. Way better vegetarian poutine options in this neighborhood.   Have been accidentally served a meat burger before when I ordered a veggie burger so check your veggie burger before you take a bite.   Open very late- Have been here at midnight and I think I've seen them open as late as 1am."}
{"text":"Today's order: Bacon and cheese burger, with a side of perfect sweet potato fries that melt in your mouth! Washed it down with a good Quebec brew of Griffintown.   Life is good.  Gourmet Burger even has a sticker on the door that says Yelp loves them :) I second that! I wouldn't say it's the 100% best burger in town, but it's definitely a great burger joint."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever eaten a burger so delicious in my life!! I ordered their veggie burger with guacamole and I was extremely pleasantly surprised. The guacamole tasted lemony and they were very generous with it. The patty was made out of chick peas and it was very moist and thick. Their buns appear to be homemade and are perfectly toasted. I'm definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Used the local food delivery service while staying at a hotel, the fee is $4, 35 mins to arrive. I ordered the gentleman's burger (blue cheese, walnuts, bacon) and gourmet poutine. Burger was cooked medium, as requested; very tasty! A little disappointed with my first poutine experience. The fries were drowning in gravy, hoped they would be just swimming. It was like French fry soup. Had the poutine been good, I would rate this a 4* experience."}
{"text":"I kind of agree with both the good and the bad reviews lol. It was my first time eating here and I had the chicken burger with add-ons of  bacon, guacamole, and cheddar. I didn't realize ahead of time that the burger already comes with caramelized onions. I also ordered sweet potato fries and their \"homemade\" lemonade. The total for this was $14. Taxes are already included in the prices. Anyway, sweet potato fries were good in the beginning but ended up giving me a bit of a sick stomach at the end because they were too sweet. The burger comes on a brioche bun and while the first half of the burger went down quick due to my extreme hunger, I started to notice just how sweet the bun is by the second half, so much so that I had to stop eating the fries to curb the cloying nature of the whole meal. I think the sweetness of the caramelized onions didn't help either. The chicken was made on charcoal, it wasn't dry so that's a plus, but also wasn't super flavorful. The bacon was excellent, very crispy. Guac was pretty much not evident so I think it's just mashed avocado, no seasoning. The lemonade has a weird taste to it, almost reminded me of this sweet cough syrup I loved as a child, so while it was strange and not like regular lemonade, I drank it probably due to some nostalgia lol. Overall, I'd probably go back if I was really stuck on where to eat and didn't want the million other options in the area. The bun bothers me though, and i understand another reviewer's question of hygiene. Mops and trash out in the open and the sink was not working in the bathroom so you had to use one outside of the bathroom door and only cold water. So yeah it's not super clean, but c'est la vie!  Oh and to end on a good note, portions are large so I found the price reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent.  The vegepate burger is pretty damn good, but they have messed up my order with a meat burger before, so be sure to check your burger before eating it.  The sweet potato fries are amazing and are more than worth trying out.  My one beef with this place is the spotty service.  It's like a coin toss every time on whether the clerk is going to bite my head off or be courteous to me.  Sitting down to eat sometimes means a long wait is ahead before your food is served to you.  My friends and I waited over 45 minutes to get my meal after we ordered our food once - and it wasn't exactly busy.    I figured out the best solution to these problems: I place an order for pick-up.  That way my food is ready in 15 minutes and I don't have to deal with potentially surly staff.  Anyway, I'd recommend trying it out at least.  Update:  I went here again recently and the cook burned my veggie burger.  I was not bothered by this though, and here's why: the cook came out from behind the counter, walked up to me and told me.  He apologized profusely and offered to make another one.  Then he offered me a choice of two free toppings for it to make up for having burned it.  15 minutes later I was offered a delicious burger with a ton of delicious toppings.  It was a beautiful day in the world of customer service."}
{"text":"Was not too impressed with the service or the burgers. Waitress/cashier did not smile much, no warmth at all. Burgers my boyfriend and I ordered were veg but so salty!! It was so salty that I had to drink water constantly. Fries were not bad though. Maybe the veg burgers aren't good to begin with and the beef and chicken could have been better. But still, if they can't make a decent veg burger they should not put it on the menu.  Or maybe because I have high expectations when I eat veggie burgers. Anyway place was ok, seemed like a fancier fast food restaurant to me. Very small eating area and only one person making the burgers. To conclude, it was mediocre."}
{"text":"HOR-RI-BLE! The burger with \"Foie Gras\": Dry, MSG (my mouth immediately started burning and numbing on the roof of my mouth, which is caused from MSG) and I bit into a thick piece of cartilage. The Foie had the texture of cheap canned cat food. I've had a cat and I know what cat food looks and smells like.   Fries: Disgusting. They brag that they use Canola Oil (originally produced as an industrial lubricant). It's cheap to buy for a reason. It makes fries the consistency of soggy plastic.   Chicken Sandwich:  Dry, Dry, Dry.  Salad: Old browning lettuce, horribly dry hard croutons. Dressing that was advertised as olive oil/balsamic but tasted like Canola Oil. Surprise!  False advertising! Stay Away!"}
{"text":"What is going on in this kitchen? Our burgers were beyond well done, but that wasn't the worst part, the worst part was poutine with fries that were literally fried solid black. When we complained, we were told that they were special fries. Noooo thank you.  My friends were embarrassed, they used to love this place and were hosting us from out of town. At least this was the only disappointing food during this trip."}
{"text":"Juicy, large & fulfilling burgers with sweet potato fries #yum. As a Concordia University staple, I've been there several times for poutine and burger week but most recently, I got take out to fulfil my burger and fries craving and it really hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I think it is the perfect food to order if you are home with friends and no one wants to go out or cook, which happens a lot in winter. Forget about ordering pizza and try this. I love their veggie burger with sun dried tomatoes and truffle oil, and I'm anything but a vegetarian. :D"}
{"text":"This awesome little place partnered up with Fantasia to give their ticket holders a break on food. The sweet potato fries here are cooked to absolute perfection, and back home in the States, I can still taste them! Good ice tea, too! I got a beef burger with guacamole and sauteed mushrooms and caramelized mushrooms after a screening, and it was absolutely delicious!   Had it not been for the partnership with Fantasia, I might have missed out on one of my favorite taste bud experiences in Montreal."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and I just keep coming back, every time I want a fat, juicy, tasty burger. With so many ingredient options and possibilities for new flavour combos, it seriously never gets old!  You choose your meat (or non-meat - veg options, yo), which often includes choices like bison, lamb or fish. They switch the options up on occasion. Then you pick from a massive menu of gourmet options for toppings and then from a whole separate menu for cheeses. OMG, cheese. Some of my favourite choices include brie (because melted brie is heaven), goat cheese or gouda. The other fixins I love are carmelized figs, mushrooms, nuts, bacon and I could go on.  All burgers come with the basic carmelized onions and tomato/lettuce if you want them. Also, highly recommended: sweet potato fries with one of their mayo options. I'm partial to garlic.  The staff here are ALWAYS super cool, relaxed, friendly like they're your best friends, and very helpful. Last time, they even asked if they could put on our favourite music for us while we ate. (Current fave: Molly Nillson)  Last pointer: check out the funhouse bathroom with its infinity mirror setup."}
{"text":"Save youself some time and money and dont' go there!! In a nutshell: $40 for 2 people, flavorless, overcooked, awkward environment, tiny condiment cups, DRY, soggy undercooked fries, lame poutine, soda in glass bottles and slow! HARVEY'S is better!!"}
{"text":"Super bon , mais chère on paye pour chaque ingredient de plus comme le fromage  Les frites au patate douce super bon  Bon service aussi  Malgré le prix j'y retourne  La place devrait etre plus grande"}
{"text":"Came here with my dad late at night. The servers were super chill.   The burgers themselves were decent. You need to get toppings though, otherwise the burger just won't taste as good."}
{"text":"L'un des meilleurs burger que j'ai goûté à montreal, ils ont d'ailleurs aussi ouvert au Maroc. C'est un petit fast-food avec des produits frais et une bonne viande. J'ai toujours du mal avec les burgers à montreal qui ne semble pas avoir de la viande hachée fraîche mais congelée.  Si vous avez des propositions pour d'autres bons burgers à montreal je suis prenante!"}
{"text":"I went to Le Gourmet Burger once before this disaster visit. For that first visit, I remember thinking that the place was ok. Service had been lacking and likewise the food had been nothing special. But for Burger week my wife and I decided to give it another chance since we were downtown. The burger offered for Burger Week sounded good too.  Bad mistake. I left feeling unappreciated as a customer due to bad service and disappointed about the food.  We arrived around 6:30PM. There were 3 people in front of us, so it took several minutes to order in between the other people ordering and the staff just randomly doing other things, but taking my order. So at 6:43 we placed our order. A few minutes after 3 people of the 5 people in staff decided to go for a break. This is fine except that I suspect this added to my wait. So by 7:00PM we started noticing some people that arrived after we ordered receiving their food. So I went to the counter to ask why other people that had ordered after me had already received their food. I was assured that nothing was wrong that they were making food in order. I was trying to be understanding,so I waited another 15min or so and I decided to ask again. One of staff finally scrambled to find my order, which she could not find among the orders they were preparing. As it turns out, the staff had mistakenly put my order in the pile of already completed orders. At that point I expected some sort of apology, but the person proceeded to say they would make it right away only. They staff still took another almost 10 min to make it. By the time I received my food,it was almost 7:30PM. (Closed to 1 hour since I arrived) The person that handed my food to me noticed I was visibly annoyed and apologized, but she did not seem to mean the words she was saying as she kept making excuses and her body language was anything but apologetic. At the end in her body language and very insincere apology, she basically was telling me to suck it up and deal with it. At that point, I could not believe the attitude I was getting from the staff and told her that her half felt apology was not enough. I suppose it was wrong of me to expect her to at least sincerely apologize! So the employee next to her gave a stare and mumbled something as if I had said something so outrageous and out of line. I calmed myself and moved along as at that point I was ready to explode.   Fuming I proceeded to have my food--after all I paid for it and wanted to at least have my meal with some dignity. I had ordered the special for Burger week, which happened to be a burger with some mushroom, onions, and cheese sauce.  The burger was something I could have gotten from the bar next door. Nothing really special. So this is what I had gone all this trouble for.    Save yourself the hassle. In all honesty there are many establishments that appreciate your patronage. Le Gourmet Burger is not one of them. Perhaps it is representation of the training provided to the staff--or lack thereof- that instills in them that dealing with a customer only represents a transaction and genuinely caring about customers is optional. Frankly, I did not feel appreciated as customer and will never be supporting them in the future. And if I have any influence on anyone else, I will be suggesting that they go somewhere where service to the customer is noticeable in the behavior of the staff.  If you are looking for good burger place there is Five Guys, and Smart Burger close by. And a half a dozen other establishments elsewhere in Montreal that will treat you better and will serve a great burger. No need to compromise."}
{"text":"One of the  most unsanitary restaurants I've experienced downtown. Just witnessed the \"cook\" mop a dirty floor with a hand rag, NOT wash his hands, and then handle the hamburger, bun and lettuce with his bare, dirty hands. To boot, he's wearing a dirty hat on his head, and eating food with his bare hands whilst cooking customers' food. If you're going to call your restaurant \"gourmet\", and operate with an open kitchen, then how about some hygiene, ie) soap in the cook's kitchen? Blech."}
{"text":"I disagree with the positive reviews that others have posted about this place.  The service is non-existent, and I had a much better burger at the Fudruckers at Houston Intercontinental Airport before boarding my plane to Montreal.  No, I had a better burger at the McDonalds just a few blocks west on St. Catherine.  I had the Classic Burger, and it at least looked pretty.  However, the taste was far from the burger heaven I expected.  I should have read the reviews in Yelp more thoroughly because the brownie was indeed hard and stale.    I recommend that you completely skip Gourmet Burger.  You can find a better burger in Montreal for less than half the price."}
{"text":"Awesome burger! The bun was actually one of the best parts. Sweet potato fries: perfect. The only negative were the regular fries, which were burned and dried out. The service was fine, nothing special."}
{"text":"Our overall experience was pretty bad. First, our order had gotten mixed up by the cashier, she told us we had to come back and pay for a burger patty that she forgot to charge us for. We paid for it, but it became a rather expensive place for the atmosphere of the restaurant,  and the confusion happening behind the counter. We waited for what seemed longer then what would be normal, no big deal except for the fact that some of our finished food is sitting there on the counter waiting for everything else and getting cold. By the time the food was ready there were four burgers for only three of us. And the people behind the counter couldn't figure out why. It took all three of the employees to realize they goofed and over charged us and cooked too much food. Again, no big deal, except our food is just sitting there waiting for us and then gets man handled by the guy in charge. He apologizes by throwing the other two under the bus. We finally get to eat our food and it was disappointing. Lackluster burger (the Mayaplaya) and undercooked fries. My friends liked their food but they aren't picky. While we are eating all three employees decide to go outside for smokes. What the actual hell? I wish I had taken a picture of the way they left the counters looking with unprepared food sitting out and uncovered. I felt the rage of Gordon Ramsay. That's gross and unsanitary. The phone rang twice unanswered because they were busy smoking and talking. They didn't care when I got up to tell them. It was only an online order waiting to be accepted, no big deal. I was really tempted to tell them what an unprofessional and gross restaurant they are running (they never wash their hands either) but I'm sure they know already. Don't bother eating here."}
{"text":"Really good burgers here, got the burger with sautéed mushroom, eggplant, cheese and bacon.  It's a custom made burger place, you need to choose all your toppings for charges except lettuce and tomato for free.  The burger was so juicy, I almost couldn't believe it. My friend got an extra fried egg in his burger, it was amazing! The running yolk really added a layer of extra texture.  The fries was ok, we got the regular fries, the sweet potato fries looked better, all other tables got them.  Quote from my friend \"any burger place that has eggplant is a great burger place\" Comparing to all the other burger places, I highly recommend this one!"}
{"text":"When i'm in the mood to punish my body with pure goodness- i show up at Gourmet Burger where nothing but perfection is served.  This isn't fast food. Be prepared to wait up to 15 minutes for your burger, and watching it being made is half the fun. Gourmet Burger is one of those rare places that takes pride in their fresh food. Everything from the fresh cut potatoes to the constant caramelization of onions is mind boggling.  My favourite is the Gentleman burger, complete with walnuts, blue cheese and bacon. And not saggy, white, chewy bacon- no; i'm talking crispy, salty bacon crackers that make me want to chew forever.  Good job Gourmet Burger! I will gladly pay $15 for your food and never regret it."}
{"text":"Good burgers, but they get expensive once you add on toppings. The selction of toppings is great, but to spend $40 on 2 burgers, 2 poutine, 2 drinks, and a beer seemed a bit steep for what it was.  The lemonade was delicious, and the two kids working (cashier and cook) were incredibly friendly. The cook was playing The White Stripes off his ipod and we started talking about music and our man crushes for Jack White.  The cashier did serve me a beer at room temperature. It was our first night in Montreal and I was beat from the drive, so I didn't question it. I figured they must not chill beer in Montreal. What do I know? Lucky for me it was a good enough local beer that I was able to drink it without a problem. But then as we are leaving, she asked if the beer was okay at room temperature and explained that the fridge was broke and had been down all day. Really, you could mention that when I ordered it. Oh well, her being cute and friendly made this much easier to take."}
{"text":"This place has false advertising, had me walk 15 min in the cold, and was closed. They advertise 1am but were closed by 11:30pm"}
{"text":"This is seriously a hard place to review, for multiple reasons.  First of all, I really liked that they don't try too hard. The place looks basic but clean, and the staff are very knowledgeable about their menus. So that's good. No nee to be fancy.   I stepped in there on a Monday afternoon, and the place was empty. The waitress was leaning against her counter preparing some plates and fries bowls. She told me to grab a menu and ask for help if I needed it. She explained how everything worked and suggested multiple sides to add in the burger. Overall, nice.  I have to admit, I have a big appetite, so I can't blame restaurants when the bill goes higher than expected, but here, I was a little shocked. Nothing is free. The menu splits everything individually, buns, meat, cheese, sides, and condiments all have their prices and if you don't check yourself, it goes up fairly quickly.   Once the shock is over, comes time to eat. Not going to lie (and I didn't remove any stars for that) I freaking hate their plates. It looks great, but has zero use. I mean, the burger was awesome. Seriously, it was great, it was juicy even though the meat was a little more done than I would've liked, but the plates are so stupidly narrow that the they hold nothing falling off your burger.   But for real, the burger was good. The only thing that really bugged me is that they automatically put lettuce and tomatoes in it. I hate tomatoes and wasn't expecting to have anything i my burger that I didn't ask for. But once I removed them, I must say, I really enjoyed it. But that is all for the food. I tried the sweet potato fries and found myself regretting it. Nothing special there, simple potatoes with a great lack of taste.   I would probably go back, try a float with my burger. It was good, but not extraordinary."}
{"text":"Was in the area and felt like a good burger, so came in here.  Very casual place, but still nice, emphasis on good burgers and friendly staff. way less intense and pretentious than m:brgr, although both have their pros/cons.  Since it's burger week, ordered two of the specials: mushrooms, fondue cheese, spicy mayo, chipotle, and a bunch of other stuff. Fries, drinks. It was really good and yummy. I'd definitely return. The sweet potato fries were perfect. Honestly, some of the best ones I ever had in my life (not that I'm a connoisseur or anything), but I couldn't imagine a fried chip tasting better with such texture. I wonder why the normal fries aren't exactly the same texture.  My one complaint about this kind of place though is this semi self-service business. What I mean is when you pay at the counter, and serve your self, for the most part, yet there is still kind of service, like some things get brought to the table etc, most you get yourself, but it's not clear ever. What's annoying about this kind of place, is that I usually don't tip 15% at a self serve, but these places seem to kind of require a bit of tip for the semi-service, and I can never tell.   I got the feeling today that a staffer was upset that I tipped like 7.5% instead of 15%, and this happens at every semi self-serve. It's awkward, I wish policy would be clearer place to place."}
{"text":"Burgers, I like my burgers like I like my women, a hot mess. So all these Upscaled Burgers get on my nerves. And Le Gourmet Burger is no different.  You'd think I would learn but I keep trying. In I go this small quaint little restaurant, hoping for burger goodness. But that would be what I like to call WRONG.   I'm not gonna mess around and I'm gonna deconstruct this thing called a burger. First the bun, dry and over seasoned with sesame seeds. I love sesame seeds but here there was to much and tasted overcooked. All burger comes with lettuce, tomato, and caramelized onions. Now I never tasted them onions. The client also has a huge array of possible toppings. I opted for bacon (duh!) and Boursin. Now Boursin is awesome but let's face it, it's France's answer to Kraft Philly cheese. It's a cheap, cheap cheese and yet it was more expensive than Brie but it added a nice taste to the burger. Also added some delicious garlic mayo.  \"But Dave, what about the patty?\" you say. Yeah about that. The burgers are grilled over charcoal. Personally I prefer burgers on a flattop but grilled over charcoal, not bad either. However you better cook it right. Charcoal will dry ground chuck FAST. And TADA I got me a dry overdone patty. Firstly, you need at the very least 20% fat content if yer gonna fire grill burger. (Why I love flattops, the burger cooks in its fat.). The fat will keep it moist and add, you guessed it, flavour.  The burger looked pretty but tasted just north of OK.  Fries? Well they were pretty tasty in my poutine. The sauce was pretty tasty to, but I don't feel it was made from a reduction but I could be wrong, and ehhhh WHERE'S THE CHEESE? Looked more like fries with sauce than poutine.  Oh and homemade lemonade my ass.  The Cheeburger Cheeburger experience is far more what I look for in a burger. Simple, fresh made but awesome burgers. Meat, buns, cheese and bacon. No trippy hippy upscale bullshit. Burgers should not be upscaled, it should be a hot messy affair. So Le Gourmet Burger get's a middle of the road 3 outta 5."}
{"text":"Burgers of all kinds cooked to order. If there's a line, it may not be fast, but these burgers are worth the wait. Large selection of fresh toppings, and prices are reasonable. Friendly staff, too."}
{"text":"Good little place.  It had a modern interior, but felt like a mom and pop (although the 2 workers were young).  The beef is cooked when you order.  There is a wide selection of toppings/cheeses to make your burger your own.  There are only 2 people working in this establishment, so don't expect the world.  The prices aren't expensive either (for Canadian food at least)($5 for the meat, about $1 per topping).  The lemonade was quite good, wish they gave more!  They offer sweet potato fries to make them healthier, but I still prefer the normal french fry."}
{"text":"Went here for Burger Week expecting to be blown away. The description read like a great novel, drawing me in closer with every word. But when I got a closer look, it read more like a Mad Magazine.   After waiting about 25 minutes for our food (5 of which were spent eyeing our finished patties as they sat on the counter), these lacklustre beef injections were dropped on a tray and handed to us.   So after unwrapping this sadly dressed meatwich, I go in for me first bite... lukewarm (did I order an iceburg?). Say what you will about McDonald's, at least they keep their grub above room temperature. On top of that, our steamed yams (SKINERRRRR!) were dry and poorly garnished - definitely not worth the $10 it cost (without fries, I might add).   Anyway, if you want slow service, cold burgers and overpriced everything, Gourmet Burger is the place for you. But you're better than that, and you know it."}
{"text":"maybe it has something to do with the 10 beers I drank on St.Patty's day before coming here , but this was the best burger I've had in a long time.  I like how they have a open kitchen so you can see exactly what's happening,   Choices are limited, but what they do, they do gooooood."}
{"text":"Kinda pricey but good flavors on the burgers from the extra condiments.  Basil pesto and goat cheese are awesome.    But comes down to terribly overcooked beef, overcooked egg on the burger (Dear LGB, the point of an egg on a burger is to have the yolk break over the beef, NOT to have a piece of rubber on your hockey puck of a burger).    And FFS, the poutine.  I'm a NYer, NOT a poutine expert, but something tells me I shouldn't be able to up stab at it with a fork and PICK UP 3/4 OF THE ENTIRE PORTION ON MY FORK BECAUSE IT'S A BIG CONGEALED WRECK OF GRAVY, CHEESE AND GREASE.  Yeah, pretty sure one normally doesn't require and fork AND KNIFE to eat poutine.  Yes, LGB, I just described your food as a CONGEALED WRECK...not a good look."}
{"text":"Belle petite place pour burger à emporter. Belle variété de choix. Perso, j'ai trouvé mon burger et poutine un peu trop salés. Mais j'y retournerai. Belle place."}
{"text":"OK, Montreal's burger wars just went up a notch and Le Gourmet Burger has definitely upped the ante.  Not nearly as unnecessarily expensive as m:brgr, not as out of the way as La Paryse and with more options than Steerburger, Le Gourmet Burger hits the right balance between price, taste and location. Plus you can always run across the street afterwards for a beer at McKibbons. The sweet potato fries, the veggie burger, the different types of condiments (garlic mayo, wasabi mayo anyone?) peanut butter milkshakes are all worth writing home about. The burgers are huge, come in with an appetite! I'll be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"You can order by picking toppings or choose a burger in a list. The service is quite slow.  So so burgers. Buns were cold. The beef patty was almost raw for my friend's burger.  I choose sweet potatoes fries and they were excellent.  It cost me about $20 for a drink, a burger and french fries, a bit overpriced."}
