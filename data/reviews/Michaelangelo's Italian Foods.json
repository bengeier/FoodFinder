{"text":"This pizza is this closest to authentic New York City that I have found!  There is something about NYC pizza that is crispy and gooey and amazing that can't be replicated here in Canada.  This pizza is very close.  I don't know what their secret is but it's sooo gooood!"}
{"text":"I must say, by far the biggest/best panzo I've ever had. Coupled with great customer service. The owner was very friendly and passionate about his craft. I've lived 5 minutes away for the last 10 years and never even knew this place existed. I truly wish I ran into this place earlier! Number one example why independent family owned restaurants should never be taken out by big franchises, you truly taste the difference in the quality of the product!!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"A good old fashion neighbourhood pizza take-out place. No dine-in room. It's usually not that busy so service isn't slow. The menu isn't super expansive but they do have the usuals (pizza, wings, panzerrotti, etc).  The main problem with this place is that it only opens after 4 PM which is strange. Even on weekends it doesn't open till 4.  The pizza is fairly decent and the sauces are good. I'd say it's better than the average chain (cough Pizza Pizza) but not mind-blowing. However, there aren't a tonne of good pizza places in this region of Mississauga so it's worth a try.  Prices are average, $10 for a large 1-topping is good."}
{"text":"Been going to this place on an almost weekly basis for the past 13 years. Great food and great service"}
{"text":"Best slice since 1990 in the Meadowvale town centre. Moved a year before they tore down the mall to the Windwood spot. The slice has its own process so it's a step up from the pizza. I get a slice and Brio every time and that's all you need to do. The owner makes everything and has for over 25 years the same way with real primo cheese. No oil nasty dough here, just crispy crust and a clean sauce and cheese mix. I'd put this slice in the slice olympics and it's for sure gonna medal."}
{"text":"Never eat their pizza!!! If you try that, you can't stop eating!!! You will be addictive!!! I can't sleep without their food, every single night!!! Best Italian food for ever...."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, considering the neighbourhood. Definitely your best bet. It's always made with fresh ingredients, and the service is exceptional. Become a regular, and they'll hook you up with great twists all the time."}
{"text":"Old school pie!!!  I had to wait a bit, but it was well worth it. One man making magic was woth the wait."}
{"text":"Im specific with my tastes in pizza. This place makes a genuine great pizza the way my old etobicoke place does (that may not sound complementary but it is because that place is awesome!). Nice guy owner, uses quality ingredients. Delivery was good but i usually pick up."}
{"text":"Pretty sure they messed with our pizza. Second time ordering from them. First time was pretty good. This time I called in a delivery order. The man on the phone kept getting annoyed, first when he couldn't understand where I was at and then when I asked about half/half topping, which he refused to do. Was supposed to have green peppers, we found one tiny piece of pepper. Most importantly, something about the pizza just tasted wrong, unusual flavours we both couldn't identify. It was so dominant, it ruined the meal. So get this, the man calls me back about 10 minutes later and asked me how we liked our pizza, something that's never happened to me before. I told him something tasted strange about it, and he literally laughed and hung up. So yeah, fairly certain he put something on the pizza that wasn't supposed to be there, intentionally. I hope for his sake it wasn't something that makes me or my wife sick. That would be very regrettable. Avoid this pizza joint at all costs."}
{"text":"Sooo gooood... we had two big slices of pizza and thoroughly enjoyed every bite while sitting in bed watching anime"}
{"text":"***update**  Im taking his stars away. Today it was again with the lies of how walk in special for $10.75 is only bread and tomato paste. He goes how I should add cheese for $1.89. How can pizza be called pizza without cheese??. He goes he wants me to be not cheap and how he wants me to be happy with my food. Anyways he flip flopped multiple times between how there is and isn't cheese on the walk in special. Then I confronted him with his own flyer and how there is cheese on his own flyer (attached). Is this guy Bi-polar? He makes his own menu yet feels customers won't be happy.. Oh and guess what, the flyer is 20 years old as per him and cheese has since been removed. ALL Lies to make less than $2. Shame!!..   **** previous review ***** Probably one of the best Pizza I have ever had. **BUT** Michaelangelo himself need's an attitude adjustment. He is super aggressive with the up sell's. Ever try ordering his walkin special. I have.. Twice. He starts telling you things like \" Who eat's pizza with no toppings\" and \"It is just going to be thin tomato paste laid on bread\" (it wasn't). He pushes and pushes until he gets really loud and animated. Almost making you feel cheap for ordering pizza the way you want. There is porbably some minimum he wants to make per order and you can bet he will yell at you till he gets what he wants. Customer service missing!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Very unique toppings that were incredibly fresh and the owner is super nice!"}
{"text":"we had a medium size deluxe. you wont even see the toppings cuz they are barried under a crazy thick layer of cheese. great pizza, great service, everything is homemade."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Michaelangelo's on a random Saturday after hearing only good things from her grandparents.  We tried the Greek pizza and it was delicious; we can't wait to try more of their pizza.  The owner is incredibly friendly and he really knows how to make an amazing pizza.  P.S. the garlic dipping sauce is a must."}
{"text":"\"Welcome to the family!\" The owner is so warm and friendly. The pizza is thin crust, and loaded with toppings. Everything is house-made. The \"side of fries\" was a whole box of delicious crispy fries. And we were introduced to Brio, a Italian coke that tastes like nothing else! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city.   If you liked the Big Slice Downtown, back in the day, this is the modern equivalent.  Same location and same dude making pizza for 20 years.   I bought pizza for my son's birthday in May and everyone asked me where I got if because they never had such Amazing pizza that didn't taste mass produced like pizza pizza or Pizza Nova in this area.   If you're staying in a hotel out the area. Order in.  Get the city's best at your hotel door."}
{"text":"Collosal pizza slices coming out the doors of Michaelangelo's. Your jaw will drop when you see the size of the pizza slice, which is closer to the size of a tea towel. The pizza's crust is unique. Very thin and incredibly flaky and crispy. The cheese and sauce are tangy and salty, and carry large amounts of flavor. The cheese is broiled to perfection, brinigng new layers of flavor to the cheese. This pizza will astonish and appease any pizza lover around, which is basically everyone!

{"text":"5 stars. Best pizza I've ever tasted.  It's taste is unique unlike any of our usual Pizza Pizza, Nova, Mama etc.   The crust is crunchy but not oily. Pizza huts crust is crunchy too but because they use tons of oil.   The cheese is delicious, different from the other places.   Large size is pretty big. 2 slices you are already quite full. But you just can't stop eating it.   I see no reason not to give this store 5 stars!  Wonderful owner too, gave kids pepperoni to chew on while waiting."}
{"text":"Smells. So. Damn. Good.     Everything from scratch. Amazing friendly staff. A real hidden gem. Meatballs and pizza. Try them !!!"}
{"text":"Huge pizza slices, cheese and sauce are great. Recommend this place to anyone who wants a good slice for a great price."}
{"text":"Awesome! Great food. Great owner. Quality you can taste. They deliver to most hotels in Mississauga. Do yourself a favor and get pizza delivered from this place instead of the crap the hotel gets for u."}
{"text":"I drive 45 minutes to get pizza from Jose. Excellent service and value. Food is amazing."}
{"text":"Literally the best pizza ever! This is a small business, but the owner treats all his customers like family. The pizza here is absolutely delicious and authentic! Definitely look forward to coming back and highly recommend this spot to all pizza-lovers!"}
{"text":"Order 3 pizzas and honey garlic wings.  Cheese, pepperoni and chicken for the 3 pizzas.  All were delicious as usual.  Much better than any of those big chains. Individually, the wings were not that big in size. The sauce was at the bottom, instead of pouring over top or mixing, which helped with it not getting soggy too quick. Tasty as well and plenty of sauce.  Each pizza gets plenty of pepperoni or chicken.  I love the pepperoni here.  Don't cheap out like the big chains. Definitely a hidden gem as it is more within a residential neighborhood, but everyone needs to try this place at least once."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. The best I've ever had so far.Flavorful and big. We ordered the deluxe pizza. Love it so much. The owner is a very nice guy. This is our first time trying, definitely will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Best slice in GTA! Just like NYC. The crust is super thin and crispy with a good chewy consistency. It's almost flakey too! Whole pizzas here are great too but not as good as the slices.   Owner is super nice and remembers who you are. The only problem is that he's not open more often."}
{"text":"I went on a 25 minute drive mission just to try their famous huge pepperoni slice.    I checked their hours before arriving on a Sunday.  4-10.  I arrived around 4:20.  Perfect I thought, as the pizza would be super fresh.  The parking lot was completely empty and I thought they were unexpectedly closed that day.  Luckily, I noticed they're 'Open' sign flashing.  Huge wave of relief.  Yesssss.  I walk in and was greeted happily by, who I can only assume is the owner.  Very friendly.  He informed me it would be about an 8 minute wait as he was still making the pizza.  Fine with me! In fact, i didn't mind at all as this would ensure me a hot out the oven slice. I sat and waited.  There aren't any tables or seats to eat.  Just 3 seats meant for taking a quick seat to wait.  I started to smell that fresh pizza smell and knew my slice was almost ready!  The man thanked me for waiting and I told him I didn't mind at all. He carefully packaged my slice and I was on my way.  For a slice and a larger bottle of water, it cost me around $6 something.  I sat in my car and carefully took the humongous slice out.  This thing was larger than my face.  It was amazing.  Totally worth the drive.  It was very thin, which is how I was able to eat the whole thing in one sitting.  Minus the crust though, I don't eat crust.  However, the dough was so soft towards the crust.  Pizza is not oily.  You do not have to worry about oil droppings.  It was delectably cheesy.  Looove the cheese, not stingy at all with the cheese.  The pizza does not fall apart when you bite into it.  Everything separates perfectly with each bite.  Excellent flavour and excellent sauce. I would 100% come back and get this again."}
{"text":"Best pizza is Mississauga. Owner is friendly but no seating (delivery or take-out only)."}
{"text":"Great flavours. Great pizza. Amazing service. A nice take out place located in a small plaza in Meadowvale area."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and I must say I was so impressed the pizza and panz were awesome and to top it off I had told the owner that it was my first time ordering from there and an hour later he called to ask how we liked the pizza, wow. Best pizza in the area by far."}
{"text":"Great pizza with AMAZING customer service!  We ordered from a hotel. Got our hot pizza with a homemade crust within an hour and the homemade garlic butter dipping sauce was fantastic.  The guy called us back 40 minutes later to make sure everything was ok!  So glad we picked him instead of a chain place."}
{"text":"Awesome huge slices. Nice semi crisp crust with great sauce n cheese. Good homemade dipping sauces too."}
{"text":"Note:  They only have pepperoni slices here.  Otherwise, you'll hafta order an entire pizza to get other toppings.  Makes sense as a local place that isn't super high-traffic.  If you're in the area and have a choice between chain pizza and Michaelangelo's, it's a no-brainer, Michaelangelo's all the way!  Btw, this slice was even better than a recent one I had at a huge Italian bakery.  I've had this place bookmarked for a while, but the last time I stopped by, it was closed.  So pay attention to their hours of operation.  They are only open in the evenings for a few hours each and every night.  So no lunch pizza for you!  Plus -  friendly owner -  huge slices -  according to owner, everything is made on-site, he said nothing is from \"cans\" -  apparently they have delivery  Hey, it's a small business -  only pepperoni slices -  located in a small, neighbourhood plaza (barely a plaza) in Meadowvale -  primarily takeout/delivery, but there's a picnic table outside and a few chairs inside  'za is thin crust, on the crusty/crispier side, drier, not saucy, and definitely NOT oily!!!  This was good pizza and quite unexpected for a place that's hidden in a residential area.  I got a spicy garlic dipping sauce - I probably had to pay for - but owner said he makes it himself and there was quite a kick!  I would definitely order from there when I'm at my sister's / pick up a slice when I'm in the area.  Too bad it's not closer, but maybe that's a good thing.  :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I were just around Mississauga for some business and wanted to grab dinner before heading back to Toronto (to avoid traffic). We decided to use Yelp as neither of us are familiar with the area. We found this place that has 5 stars based on 13 reviews. So we were like, why not?  Turns out it wasn't a sit down place, but rather a grab and go kind of place. There was a wooden table and benches outside but it was WAY too cold for that. There was only one person in there and he greeted us loudly. My buddy and I decided to order the 2 large pizza with 6 toppings combo (for ~$30 after tax).   We were in love.  Freshly baked pizza. The crust was so soft it was not hard chewing it compared to the other pizzas I've had. You can tell the whole pizza was made by the man himself. Nothing was bought pre-made. Every bite was a pleasure. Since it was too cold outside, we decided to just eat the pizza in the store by the counter. We enjoyed the pizza while having a nice chat with the owner. He was one of the nicest dudes I've ever talked to. I received a free Italian soda on the house and the owner was nice enough to share some of his homemade pasta sauce for me to dip my crust in (the sauce was delicious as well).  I feel like I've talked about the owner as much as the food. But honestly, the kindness from the owner definitely made the pizza taste so much better. The whole time we were having the pizza he kept smiling as he knew we were enjoying the hell of out it. He's one of the owners that truly cares about the customers and really wanted serve quality pizza.  I am so glad we found this place through Yelp, and if I am ever back in Mississauga I will definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"For slice lovers, this is place is great! If you are hungry and looking for a tasty slice of pizza, this is your best option in the Streetsville/Meadowvale area. No dine in,  take out and delivery only,short hours,  but the best tasting pies in Mississauga. The meats and sauces are always flavourful and tasty and on top of that you are supporting an indy business who appreciates your business ;o)"}
{"text":"So nice to have a real pizza shop exist in this neighborhood. I come around here once or twice per year - and I'm adding this place to my go-to/must order list.  Pizza was great, thin crust, fresh toppings and didn't taste manufactured like other stuff in the area. Service was extremely personable and friendly. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I gave this place a try, based on the great reviews. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised how good the pizza is. The owner is a nice enough guy and he got to know me after my first pizza and called me at home for some feed back. I have been back since my initial order and I have not been disappointed. Great !"}
{"text":"I walked in this afternoon to get a pepperoni slice.  The owner behind the counter put it in the oven and I waited 5 minutes for it to heat up. It came to $4.50 and was told I could not pay by credit or debit as he gets charged too much by the bank. He said if I buy more items like a dipping sauce or pop I can pay with anything I like. I ordered a pop and he put the slice on a cheap paper plate. I asked if he could put it in a box and he ignored that and put it in paper bag.   The slice was huge, and cut in half, it's like two regular sized slices. Unfortunately I really didn't like the taste of it. It seems he adds some different type of spice to his tomato sauce, perhaps curry. The crust is thin and the outer edge crust tasted floury. There isn't much cheese and a lot of it was overcooked."}
{"text":"First time trying this pizza and I think it was ok. The pizza crust was thin and almost flaky but didnt have that much flavour. The sauce was ok the seasoning had a hint of indian flavour to me which didnt go with the pizza but the cheese and pepperoni were good maybe if the slice was hot it would have been better. The restaurant could have been more taken care of that kind of threw me of but I still gave it a try. If you are in that area then its worth a try but the best slice in the GTA is Lucas pizza hands down not this place."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the most underrated pizza shops in Mississauga. Their crust is crispy and fluffy on the inside, only fresh toppings are used, and you can taste real mozzarella!  The owner is really friendly and I always love to return to this joint."}
