{"text":"Saw several positive reviews on Yelp and thought I should give it a try when I was in the area. The reviews were right, really delicious chicken and LOVED the sauces (especially the spicy one). Would 100% come here often if I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Great chicken, tasty sauces and sides, and excellent service. It's not fancy but it is good. Well worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Had their food twice. Dined in the first time. The guys were enthusiastic and I felt that they were really trying but they managed to get my order wrong ... twice on the first visit. I heard other tables complaining the same. The chicken was good enough to bring me back though.   The second time, I got take-out. $29.50 Yelp check-in offer for a family combo (menu listed a whole chicken, 4 buns, 2 large sides (I chose fries and Peruvian salad which as per their menu contains lettuce, tomatoes and avocado) and 2 types of sauces which I assume will be their signature hot AND mild sauce).  What I actually got when I opened up the package when I got home were: 2 breasts + 2 legs, 4 pieces of thin mini loaf slices, one large fries, 1 large Peruvian salad that had 3 pieces of avocado the size of a fingernail, and only 1 kind of sauce.    So my question is: was it because of the check-in offer or was it because it was a take-out meal? I do not feel what I received truly matched their menu description. The 4 mini loaf slices add up to maybe 1.25 slices of a white toast, definitely not 4 buns. The avocado in the salad was non-existent. If you are running out of your signature sauce (which you should not if you claim it to be your speciality), you should let your customers know when they place their order.   Their chicken is moist and flavourful and that is the only thing they have going for them. Don't waste your money on their sides."}
{"text":"Those yuca fries ... absolutely delicious with the dip.  Actual chicken is also very good, especially when combined with their sauces. They have daily deals as well which I suggest trying."}
{"text":"There are not many places you can get Peruvian rotisserie in the GTA so we did the 45 min trek from Mississauga/Oakville to Markham to try this out and it did not disappoint. We ordered a the 1 chicken 2 sides (salad and yucca fries) meal with anticuchos and a Inca Cola. The Food was fantastic.  My fussy 5 year old ate almost half the chicken. Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend I saw this place on Markham road and 14th Avenue when we saw this place it was being built and he already had interest in dining there.   So we finally did, when you go in its a small place with 2 floors.  The bottom floor serves as a place where you can order,  their menu is with chicken and side dishes. I believe the place is Latin,  anyways we got a combo (it's in the picture). For what we ordered, service and the taste it was well worth it.  The service was quick and the man was super friendly. Usually in restaurants you're supposed to give tips but since you pay first and you go to the second level of the restaurant to wait for your food you don't have to.   I really enjoyed my first time dining here,  it was different from other restaurants and I'm looking forward to coming back.  Oh yeah,  the combo was only $25 including tax. It's cheaper than swiss chalet and filled both of us up."}
{"text":"I went in to satisfy my craving for Pollo a la brasa, and was excited to visit the new location. Needless to say I was quite disappointed with the lack of consistency  compared to my previous visits. Chicken was a bit salty and in my opinion missing that magic. The sauce has gone down a few points as well and lacks some of that punch. Overall, I would say if you're in the area it's a good alternative to swiss chalet, but being from Toronto, there are certainly better options."}
{"text":"from all the good reviews on Yelp, I made my way there Friday after work today.  we placed our order at 5:37 pm, our food did not arrive till 6:07 pm.  all we ordered was the Friday special (2 legs with side of yuka) and a chicken sandwich with fries.  couldn't believe it took 20min  and the place was not even that busy.  first bite I had was the piece of bread that came along with the meal and I must say, it was pretty good (or maybe I was just hungry).  the yuka was fried pretty good as well, nice and crispy.  than I finally dived into the chicken, at first it was pretty good.  bite after bite, dip after dip there were no issues.  as soon  as I got a little closer to the bones, there it was.... redness.  I didn't think of it much at that time and it didn't really looked that bad.  I wish I had taken a photo and let u guys decide. than I made my way to the other leg...and there it was again... redness.  it was actually much worst on this leg, I actually stopped eating.    have to say... in between the first leg and the second, I actually finished the sandwich off.  from the first bite of the bread to the last bite I took in the second leg, it was less than 20 minutes.  this tells u how small the legs were and the sandwich.  or more like how fast I can eat.  or how little of the second leg was left over.  am kidding, I do eat fast...but the legs were pretty small. seriously.  $28 was the damage and I walked out more hungry and more importantly a bit scared because I swallowed lots of uncooked chicken.    will I come back.... hard to say.  this place had potential.  I guess I will wait to see how I feel tonight to decide if I should go back or not.  if there are no more reviews from  me, I guess that will give you an idea of what happened to me... lol"}
{"text":"So ive been trying to cut down on the the fried chicken from my diet and decided to give this joint a try and boy was I surprised with the quality and taste of the food!  Although I was never really a fan of rotisserie chicken , Chicos has changed all that, I ordered a whole chicken meal which came with 2 large sides and also added 3 drinks which came up to about $40 and fed me and my two friends perfectly , they also served us with their authenthic hot sauce which was really good! You can tell the sauces were made in house and not some sauce you buy at the grocery store, forget siracha sauce the hot sauce Chicos serves is not only hot but also compliments the chicken well .   The chicken was very juicy and tender, the chicken held in alot of flavour and the skin was crisp and also very flavourful, the 2 sides we ordered were rice and potato salad, the rice was nothing out of the ordinary but nonethless went well with the chicken, however the potato salad was just amazing !   Overall me and my friends had a great experience at Chicos and would return again, it surprises me that many people who live in the area have still not tried out this joint.   I live about a km away and only decided to give it a try several years after it opened.  After eating my meal I posted a picture on instagram and have since had some of my buddies go try it out and they too have not been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, first time trying this chicken and we were pleasantly surprised.  Chicken and sauce were delicious, ordered potato salad and rice.  Whole meal was very enjoyable and reasonably priced...Great alternative to Swiss Chalet and gives Nandos a run for the money.."}
{"text":"My first yelp review - the chicken was super salty the day I gave it a try.  Also, the service mid-afternoon was extremely slow.  If not for the saltiness, the meal would have been great though - the chicken was moist and had a nice charcoal flavour.  And the green sauce and the yucca fries were outstanding.  The salt was overwhelming - surprised there aren't more mentions of salt ... maybe it was just an off-batch?"}
{"text":"Worth a try for everyone I think. This place is amazing and it's too hidden for its own good.. Try it"}
{"text":"I came here when it first opened and it was not great at all, this was maybe 6+ months ago. I decided to give them another go and it's a good thing I did!  The chicken this time is moist and seasoned really well, rice and yukka fries are also good, sauce is amazing! I am waiting for them to sell it in bottles. I would have given this place 4 stars because of their dining area (it's quite small), but I mostly do take out for work lunch. The owner is super nice every time and since I'm there weekly, I'm sure he recognizes me lol. Good alternative to the Nando's down the street.. because that place sucks."}
{"text":"I was so excited about their re-opening near my house. I ordered take out with two sides and it was a huge dissapointment. The prices have gone up substantially and the quality has gone down. I paid an additional 6 dollars from their former location plus another two dollars for white breast chicken. Almost twenty dollars for a teeny piece of dry chicken. The sauce (which I went for) now tastes like tons of mayo with too much salt. The Peruvian salad (another favourite) had all lettuce, a few prices of tomatoes and cucumber and four pieces of avocado so tiny you could not even see it. The dressing tasted like ceasers from a bottle. Nando's has a better deal with chicken cooked as you order rather than what chico's has done which is grill whole chickens like Swiss chalet. Even bamiyan and paramount have better quality food with reasonable prices. Chicos if you want people to return you need to reevaluate your business model and quality and amount of food. Might be better to go to the basics which is what made you so successful."}
{"text":"Best chicken and yuca fries ever!! We decided to try this place after reading all the good reviews and we were not disappointed. We had the super combo which consisted of 1 and a half chicken and 3 sides. The chicken was very moist and tasty and we had the yuca fries, Cesar salad and potato salad as sides. Yuca fries are excellent and the sauce is yummy. Staff is super friendly and very helpful. I gave 4 stars only because the dining room is upstairs with very limited access to additional napkins/utensils/cups etc. Be sure to order everything before going upstairs"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for lunch with my book club. The staff was very good and they helped explain the items on the menu. atmosphere of this place was very good - latin music - a photo mural of peru in the background. The place is set up for take away too.  I had the double leg with yuca fries and an inca cola. The inca cola is basically cream soda. Yuca fries are made out of cassava (which is a starch commonly used in latin/caribbean cooking). Cassava gets fluffy when heated so its kind of like a french fry that is fluffier on the inside and then crispy on the outside. There is a faint sweetness to cassava.   The chicken was excellent. the crispy skin was the best and most flavorful part. But contrary to other reviews I felt the chicken itself had some flavor to it as well (its subtle but definitely there and has a bit of smoke to it). Comes with sides of sauces in little containers (the sauces taste very much like peri-peri sauce from nandos; taste great with the yuca fries :).   an odd thing was that the water came in a corked bottle and you pour it yourself. ask for more water and they are happy to oblige. my double leg /fries was 17.50. Pretty good in my opinion although some will probably find this pricey since swiss chalet is less - but if you fee like chicken but something a bit different I think this is worth it. will definitely return."}
{"text":"There's some pretty paltry poultry out there, but Los Chicos is definitely NOT that. I got a $9.50 lunch special: chicken wrap, a side (fries), one spicy and one mild dipping sauce, and a drink. The price is good considering the portion size and how delicious it is - roast chicken done well is chicken's truest form, I'm pretty sure.  I recommend you make amends with chicken and go here right now."}
{"text":"Got the Family Combo for takeout. Was told they no longer honour the Yelp check-in offer so I paid full price which is $2 more. The chicken tasted great but was tiny. The yuca fries were very good. The corn was very bland. They did not give me any buns even though they are supposed to be part of the combo. Worst part is they only gave me 3 small containers of sauce for 4 pieces of chicken."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service. Great price. The place is small but does have dine in tables upstairs. Would recommend instead of regular fries to get the yucca fries."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, service is fabulous and the new location is lovely! Highly recommend making the trip to Markham."}
{"text":"Hi , We were at Chicos Brasa restaurant back in 2016, at the old location and we ordered a whole chicken meal, for the very first time, and we were very happy with the service and the quality of the ingredients , to make my comment short, the chicken tasted so tender and we can tell it was free range chicken, the rice, the salad , and the yucca fries were also amazing. as far as comparing it with swiss chalet chicken, I don't think it is a fair comparison since swiss chalet does not use an eco-rottissary oven, swiss chalet uses regular cage chickens not free range, that explains why they can give you a half chicken dinner for cheap, also Peruvian rottisarry chicken requires a great number of ingredients to marinate, which are costly, also chicos uses an eco-friendly charcoal oven which costs a lot of money, unlike swiss chalet, rottissary oven which uses water steam at the bottom to make the poultry tender. At the end of the day if you appreciate the great taste of Peruvian rottissary chicken, expect to pay a little more and realize how fortunate you guys are to have a Peruvian pollo a la brasa near you since a lot of us don't have any near by, enjoy  keep up the good work Chicos! and we will be there soon to try your new location.  Regards,   Maria and Eddy  ps. Forgot to mention the aji sauces which are complimentary, huacatay, etc, so yummy."}
{"text":"In the past few months the quality has gone down tremendously. The servers are rude and low class and for take out they have headphones in slowly bopping their heads while they ignore the 5 parties who are red in the face furious at how long it takes to get their order. The chicken became dry, they changed the bun on the sandwich, the salad dressing has become bland and the avocados now have black marks, pretty much the only thing still good is their regular fries. I'm very disappointed, very sad, this place used to be delicious. the worst is that every time I go the servers for takeout ignore me, don't answer my questions, make me wait for ever, and are so incredibly rude. Like the people that only care about themselves it's utterly shocking how rude they are. There's a blonde guy in the back who's nice but the man and woman in the front are horrible and awful! The consistency is nonexistent so you could still get a good meal here MAYBE but you will be treated like someone who is inconveniencing the two servers in the front and should just leave to let them enjoy their slow time listening to music and chatting each other. And you will have to wait half an hour. This is completely unacceptable. Since getting horrible food in addition lately, there's really no reason to get treated like trash."}
{"text":"Most delicious chicken I've ever had. The green hot sauce makes it even better. Very well priced too, comparable to Swiss chalet but infinitely better tasting! We discovered this place only a month ago and have already been back three times. Only minor complaint- The rice is great but wish they wouldn't put it in a styrofoam container; by the time we got it home, the heat had melted the bottom of the container and rendered the rice inedible."}
{"text":"Love the yucca fries! A definite must try for any chicken lover. Next time I will ask for my chicken well done"}
{"text":"Great tasting food with amazing service.. only thing that was a tad disappointing was that they're not licensed for alcohol yet. The food would go amazing with a nice cold beer. But overall, great food in a very cheery atmosphere. Small place so try to call ahead if you can! The chicken is to die for and the special 'Yukon' fries so tasty yet so light! Enjoyed the ceviche too. Very Tasty!!"}
{"text":"the chickens are much better than Nando's and the $ is compatible to Swiss Chalet. If it is not the small dining room, I would give it a 5 stars"}
{"text":"Tried this place last week at their new location in Markham.  First time here and decided to eat in.  While I agree whole heartedly with the reviews that the chicken, sauces and sides are delicious, I question the pricing.  I ordered the quarter chicken and my wife ordered the two chicken leg dinner. Mine was $13 plus change and my wife's was approximately $16 plus change.  When the dishes arrived they were identical.  That is, my wife received a plate with two chicken legs and my plate contained one chicken leg.  If that was their quarter chicken dinner, then they need to look at how they are advertising their products on the menu.  I will probably get their chicken again but the better deal will be takeout."}
{"text":"Appreciated the explanation from Alvaro the owner of Chicos for the reason of my bad experience.  My original experience was on a day when new equipment was installed and therefore affecting their regular cooking routines. I gave the restaurant a second chance and tried the chicken again.  The chicken was as I hoped it would of been on my first visit...flavorful and juicy.  However, the sides are only average, I have had the potato salad, caesar and Perfuvian salad during my visits.  I would of given them a 4, but I can not fully forgive them for my horrible first experience.  Instead of serving sub par food on a day where the quality was affected by the installation of machinery, closing might of been a better option.  Who knows how many others experienced the dry chicken as I had did during my first visit.  Not everyone gives restaurants second chances...."}
{"text":"Los Chicos Brasa is a wildfully fierce and flavourful competitor to the Chalets of Switzerland and the armies of domed chickenbots. It is one of Markham's very best.  Setting & Staff: It's a small joint. It can be mistaken for a simple food stand. Upstairs is a cozy dining room. Most people, however, tend to take theirs to go.  But if you stay, you are often in good company: Los Chicos Brasa is a family run joint. This family loves their business and their customers (say hello to Javito, Nando, or Beto). It can be lost in the sea of neon and led signage and restos, 'hair and video' joints. But if you drive Markham road north of Steeles EVER: you've seen their sign, maybe even wondered a little. Follow that notion.  The Food: Let me start what I normally get. I normally get half a chicken, dark meat with the yucca fries (YOU MUST TRY THE YUCCA FRIES). Another impressive thing is that their sauces are delicious and made in house. How I came discover this was on my first visit. Nando was serving me and he came to the last bit of sauce in a squeeze bottle. He politely excused himself - it was super quiet and we'd previously parlayed at my old job - and I heard the distinct whir of a Vitamix Blender. The sauces compliment the chicken and their array of sides without overpowering. But let me talk about Chicos' chicken. It is a true testament to the flavour and moistness when I didn't realize until I finished an accidentlaly ordered half chicken that I had gone ahead and eaten white meat. It was that moist and packed with flavour. Their spices and herbs their chicken is prepared in permeates well into the skin and into the meat.  One last thing, whatever you get, if you don't accompany it with a can of Inca - I have words for you.   Overall Authenticity: It's clear I recommend this place. Highly. So I'm gonna close with a note about their commitment to flavour and authenticity. They were so committed to delivering Peruvian rotissoired chicken that they had to custom fit their fire suppression unit around a specially imported PERUVIAN CHARCOAL OVEN. In a short drive from Los Chicos you can get that domed chicken from three different places. But don't you owe it to yourself to endeavour  to try and consume this flavour Los Chicos Brasa so committedly brought? Hai. Oui, Yes. Si. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food here was great. I got the family meal with salad, fries, chicken and rice. Thy were all good but the the yuca fries were a bit tough. The homemade sauces were to die for. The service was quick and polite. The restaurant was pretty clean overall and i would definitely come here again. This place is way better than Swiss Chalet or Nandos."}
{"text":"I tried the half-chicken and yucca fries and it was simply delicious! The chicken was tender and moist, well-seasoned. They gave a very generous portion of fries and it was very crispy...the mild sauce went really well with the fries. We will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 10 with a 7.30 pm reservation.  We were not seated until almost 8 pm.  ( why then we made a reservation???).  I will review first what I liked,  waiter's were nice and friendly.  I ordered the chicken and it was tasty, the fried yucas was the highlight of the meal.  Now, let's go to what went wrong , the restaurant has seating for 25 people, and my impression was that they had 3 waiters.  It took them 1/2 hour to take our order and after that almost another 1/2 hour to bring cutlery, we had to ask for our pops as they don't even give you water.  My friend's plates were ok, nothing spectacular.  I am Peruvian and I am there to support Peruvians businesses but the service was the worst I have ever experienced the food nothing out of the ordinary mediocre at least.  Chicken that I bought for my son was RAW.  Peru has won so many prizes for their gastronomy that is sad to see Peruvian restaurant's run by people that don't have a clue how to treat a customer,  it was not worth the 45 Kms drive.  Stick with the chicken and the yucas.   The Peruvian salad was discusting!!"}
{"text":"Love getting take-out from this place. Fast, and delicious. Agree with other reviews about yuca fries, sometimes great, other times ehhh-ok (due to freshness?) But I still eat them =)  Never been upstairs though, to the actual restaurant part of the place...so, I will have to check it out someday! lol"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, the food is amazing!  I've had the Lomos Steak Sandwich and tallarines verdes with chicken.  Both very tasty and can be ordered with spice, just amazing!  Easily one of my favourite restaurants in Markham."}
{"text":"Their Peruvian chicken is very good! Very moist inside, flavourful, and tasty. I expected the cassava fries to be better but it is still very yummy. The sauces are spicy and give the meal a good kick. Will definitely be back. The Tuesday quarter leg special is a good deal."}
{"text":"I came here hosting a book club. They wanted Swiss Chalet so I thought I'd try to introduce a better alternative. I ate here 3 times at the other location and loved it.  This venue is nicer but the prices have increased so much that I probably will not come back and if I do, it will be once a year. What was $8.99 (quarter chicken meal) is now $13.50. To be fair, the food is just as good, but I've been here 4 times and the novelty is wearing off.  To be fair, the prices might be equivalent to Swiss Chalet but it is hard for previous customers to see such a price difference.  Everyone loved their meals and thought it was an excellent choice.  4 stars"}
{"text":"Went: 6:30 pm Thu July 16 2015 Ordered: quarter chicken (dark meat) with yuca fries Cost: incl. $10.00 There is just so much flavour in the chicken and the sauces that came with it were delicious. The yuca fries are probably not that great for you health-wise but were addictive and I liked eating them more with the chicken sauce than the spicy green one it came with. It is really affordable as well. Bottom line: I see myself eating here a couple of times of year for the rest of my life, and of the nearly 20 restaurants I've reviewed so far, this is the only place that I say that about."}
{"text":"We come here a lot because the chicken is so good and fresh. The potato salad is a must because you can taste the love. The mama owner makes it from scratch with her own home recipe! The chicken is true, hand slaughtered halal and high quality. You can see the roasters right In the front of the restaurant. There is seating on the top floor and in their outside patio. Very nice people as well. Try the pita sandwiches for a portable, filling lunch."}
{"text":"I've been going here since they opened the old location and followed them over here. This location is much better. Not only is this family run business top notch, the care and love they put into the food just makes it even more amazing. The chicken is a must as is the potato salad which is a family recipe. I love that the food is always consistently good. The dipping sauces and salads are so delicious and nourishing. I love this place."}
{"text":"Saw this place on my usual run to Costco and finally tried this place for the first time last Friday.   All the reviews were true!   If you want to try a delicious alternative to the typical Costco, Loblaws, Swiss Chalet, Portugese chicken... this place will definitely make your taste buds crave for more.    Sides are great too -- I liked the Peruvian Salad and didn't find it wilted;   hot sauce is amazing.    Be prepared to wait for your food though.   But what do you expect when this is as close as it gets to home cooking?"}
{"text":"Great mom and pop restaurant for all to enjoy! Their chicken is always fresh and marinated to perfection with their secret recipe. Highly recommend everyone to give it a try instead of the mundane Swiss Chalet franchise chicken..."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken and yuca fries. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and super moist! Tried the yuca fries for the first time, was not a fan but I can see why people love them! The staff were also very helpful in choosing something off the menu. Definitely will go back! Didnt wait long, food was out in less than 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"Beware: they only take cash or debit.  Upon entering, I hear the cashier telling another customer that it's cash or debit. I ran out. As someone who relies on credit cards, I don't want to be caught at a place that doesn't take credit.   I put 3 stars purely to be neutral. I did not get to try the food or see how the service is."}
{"text":"We've been hooked on this place for the past few months. The chicken is so juicy and flavourful. We love the sauces too and the yuca fries. The potato salad too is delicious. Sundays they have had ceviche and it is fresh amd tasty. The only thing I will say is be prepared for the chaos because of the intense demand. The first time I went there I ordered on the spot and paid up front. When I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes I went out and ran an errand. When I came back about 20 minutes later the order had not even started and now the place was packed. I waited another 20 minutes after that before getting my order. So we learned to either call ahead or stay there while the order is prepared."}
{"text":"We were totally drawn in by a halaal restaurant that offered a different flavour from the usual - we don't get much opportunity to eat South American (specifically Peruvian) food, so we were totally stoked to find Los Chicos while looking for Nandos on yesterday morning.  The owner had an amazing attitude and totally drew us in! I was mucho confident I was going to get a super quality amazingly good meal - especially after all the Yelp reviews we read. Sad to say it wasn't the case...  The food didn't quite impress. I'm actually sad about it because the staff and energy of the restaurant seems awesome. My pickle about it was the chicken (mainly the reason I came), it was semi burnt, not moist at all, didnt have much flavour, and super small. I really wouldn't have minded the small portion if the chicken tasted as succulent as the reviews said..but maybe i came on an off day.   We also had some beef stewy dish which tasted pretty decent! Wish we could get more of that sauce! The rice that came with the beef dish was good too. I personally wasn't a fan of the cassava fries either, I think I expected it to have the same texture as wedges but maybe it's supposed to be super crispy .... not my thing, but I would bet there are many who would like it. The corn wasn't a big hit, prefer mine on the cob if it's going to be firmer pellets, it its plated it should definitely have a softer creamier texture, imho.   Overall, I'm not likely to return due to the bad experience with the chicken. But glad we at least have it a try so we know, and tried something new. Always ready to support restaurants that offer halaal options"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday afternoon, we had the ceviche (very tasty lots of lemon), quarter leg pollo a la brasa with Yuka fries (those fries were life) and the Loma Saltado.   Everything was very delicious!!!"}
{"text":"First time coming here. My expectations were pretty low. Thought it would be just like Swiss chalet without the chalet sauce but I was quite impressed. The chicken was very tasty and flavourful. The prices were very fair. The staff was friendly and was generous with not charging extra for the sauces. The portion of the chicken is a little small so I suggest getting the combo with two sides. The seating area is quite limited so I suggest taking out if you're going with a big party. Would definitely come again and recommend it. Certainly something different from the Swiss chalet chains. This is also the only place I've had the Peruvian soda Inca Kola, which was also very good.  The best thing to get is Friday's special! Double leg Fridays! Super cheap and very delicious. My favorite is also their green hot sauce. They actually sell them by the jars! I would definitely recommend to bring one home."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get...small 1/4 chicken combo with Yuka fries $12.50ish?  Service was excellent. Yuka fries were excellent. Chicken was tasty. Portions...went to Costco for a Hot Dog after."}
{"text":"Los Chicos Brasa serves up the best roasted chicken in York region, maybe the entire GTA.   Beautifully spiced chicken, slow roasted until perfectly juicy inside, and crispy outside. All of the chicken options are served with their impeccable hot sauces - a milder green jalapeño version, and an incendiary orange habanero option. Both are spicy, but won't blow your head off - they are more layered and subtle than that!  Sides are well prepared including a terrific Peruvian salad with house made vinaigrette and avocado (nice antidote to the heat!), yucca fries (as well as proper fries), and more.  Chicken is available eat in or take out, but there's a longer menu that is only for the dine-in crowd. Includes seafood, steak and the amazing chicken, all cooked with care, and depth of flavour.  The staff, including the two co-owners are incredibly nice. And they have even had live music some weekends to accompany the Latin food with Latin tunes.  An absolutely hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Must Try: Peruvian Rotisserie Chicken, Yuca Fries  Rating: (8/10) Food, (9/10) Service, (8/10) Value, (7/10) Ambience, (8/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:   A nice spot on the east end of Markham, located in the corner of the plaza (street side). Although largely focused on take out, there is a second floor to the restaurants that does have a seating area; order downstairs first and they'll bring up your order to your seats.   I had tried the Take-Out Chicos Brasa Family Meal, with corn and yuca fries as the sides.   Having to drive home with the intoxicating smell of Chicos Brasa chicken in the car is complete torture! The scent made me want to just eat it right there in the car. Upon getting home, I found a very generous portion of meat and side dishes (one giant box of each the yuca fries and one box of corn on the cob).   The chicken was extremely flavourful and juicy, there was no hint of dryness, even in the white meat; seasoning was on point. The yuca fries were very different, but delicious and the corn h had a great rub on it. The cherry on top was the hot sauces, which were some of the best hot sauces you can get!  The service was great, didn't have to wait long to order and they were very accommodating in explaining their combos and options. The cooking are was also very clean."}
{"text":"Took our friends to dine in yesterday for the first time. We've actually introduced a number of friends to this place, despite the inconsistent service we've received from past experiences, but the food quality and taste generally makes up for it.  I was a little disappointed in yesterday's experience, as my husband and I both found hair in our dishes. He found one in his meal, while I found two and then later a third one after we informed the wait staff. I discovered the first hair after taking a bite of my salad and had to pull the hair out of my mouth. (I should mentioned that I'm also 7 months pregnant so despite being grossed out, I was extremely hungry and continued to eat until I found the 2nd hair.)  Our waiter was apologetic and said he would inform the kitchen of what happened. We are not the type of ppl to make a big fuss, but an incident like that could really cause them huge problems in the future and we just wanted to let them know.  When we received the bill, we noticed my meal was voided, but then later re-added back on, so we paid full price for the meal. I was a bit perturbed to see this as it looked like they meant to remove the meal, but then later changed their mind? I almost would have rather that they not void it at all, cuz it seemed to draw attention to the fact that they considered it and then went to the trouble to charge us anyway.   The staff was friendly and since we were celebrating a friend's birthday, we left in good spirits, but looking back the whole experience has left me sour and upset.   They seem like nice owners so I hope they learn from this experience and understand that a food business cannot be conducted this way in the long term."}
{"text":"Delicous food! Loved the steak with fries and rice - it goes so well with all of the sauces! We will definitely visit this place again. The atmosphere is welcoming and they have nice music playing"}
{"text":"I was a big fan of this place, but yesterday changed everything! We called for take out and they said it would be ready in 15-20 mins. When we got there, we had to wait for over 30 mins. The girl at the front was very unprofessional, didn't know what was happening around her and didn't seem to care that there was a huge line of people waiting.  The service was totally horrible and even though the food is good, it's totally turned me off because of that server!"}
{"text":"Came here on a sat night and tried their half chicken and yuca fries and was blown away by how fresh and juicy the chicken was. The yuca fries were hot crispy and perfectly cooked and service was amazing too.  I brought my dog and we ate outside on the patio. The chicken was so good,  we ordered seconds!  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This business has relocated to the Weston and Rutherford area. The food is mediocre, portions are small and overpriced.  The staff answering the phone can barely speak English and this makes it very stressful to place an order. Local Portuguese chicken places are better tasting, better prices and larger portions."}
{"text":"Been to their Markham Rd location a few times with friends and it was good! Went last night and when ordering wasnt informed that they serve their guests that are eating in? You used to order and then go sit, so when I got my food in a to go bag and had to ask for an exception to eat in... Just feels a bit weird with how the restaurant is set up and can be confusing for newcomers.  All in all the chicken and salad were both delicious, just some of the other organizational things that need to be worked out. A little pricy, so wouldn't go too often, but definitely would go back.  Also having good trouble finding the nutrition info on their website. Should be available for people interested in tracking their food intake!"}
{"text":"My family and I came to this restaurant because we were in the area. This was our first time trying it. I got really excited. I'm Peruvian and it is very difficult to find a decent Peruvian restaurant. I was not disappointed!  We ordered Ceviche mixto, which is mixed seafood marinated in lime juice with onions and cilantro. It is a specialty Peruvian dish. It is also a bit spicy, but that is how Peruvian Ceviche should be made. I cannot handle too much spicyness but it was still delicious. We also ordered Pollo a La Brasa, which is charbroiled chicken with fries. Our last dish was the Jalea, which is fried seafood with squid, tilapia and shrimp and came with yuca fries. For dessert we got picarones which I haven't tried since I was in Peru when I was 13 and it was really good!  Everything was really great, I had an enjoyable experience here. I am definitely recommending to my family and friends and will be returning."}
{"text":"The chicken here is good, but I think the star is the cassava fries (yuca) and dipping sauces. I think the chicken can be good, occasionally more charred and sometimes more dry than I'd prefer, but it's refreshing with the fresh flavour of chilli and lime from the sauces. It's even better with the yuca fries!  I've only done take out here but it's always ready when I call ahead for pick up!"}

{"text":"Small place but perfect for the food it is serving. Been back over 5 times now. The food is consistent, I prefer this place over Nando's simply because you can tell these boys care about the food they feed you. Service is great, you order and pay. They will bring the food to you once it is ready. average wait time for the chicken is 4-8 minutes. If you had Nando's before you know you will not get any food in less than 10 minutes. Usually get the half or quarter chicken with salad and fries. Price is good for fresh hot chicken, place is pretty clean and the 2nd floor seats about 20 people. Support the local mom and pop places and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Just took home a side chicken with a side of soggy salad and soggy fries.  Chicken was ok nothing special, not really anything very Peruvian about the food"}
{"text":"Food is good !  One of the best rotisserie chicken thats decent size and large sides !!   So worth the money on a Friday lunch ;) !!  Def will be back when I  am craving BBQ chicken !!"}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant that serves up some mightily impressive chicken!  It's a bit hidden, but I quite like the format: take-out/ordering on the main floor and dining on the second floor (they bring your order upstairs). The staff are incredibly helpful and friendly, so everything started on a good note.  The food did not disappoint! I went with the quarter chicken with potato salad and yucca fries. The sides were fantastic, especially the fries! It also came with two dipping sauces, which were both delicious. The chicken itself was wonderful. Another review (Patrick I's) mentions that they have an actual Peruvian charcoal oven, which would explain just how perfectly cooked this chicken was. The seasoning was excellent as well, so overall it was the best chicken I've had in some time."}
{"text":"Chico's was a pleasant surprise. I love roasted chicken and they didn't disappoint. I tried the take-out on a few occasions. Each time I got the whole chicken with two sides. The combo is in the mid $20 range.  The chicken was delicious, moist and perfectly seasoned. It's served was a nicely flavoured sauce but not sure what it is - not your typical BBQ sauce.  I also enjoyed the sides I tried. The rice is my favourite with a unique blend of spices but a little on the oily side. Cole slaw was also good - not too saucy or vinegar based.  Certainly better than the roasted chicken combo meals offered at Loblaws or Longo's (but almost twice the price) and on par with Nando's down the street.       PS: They have a Facebook page that provides updates on all the daily specials.  Give it a try...  BK"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken: HALAL, yuca fries are to die for, exceptional service, small eating area, sauces are out of this world! Swiss Chalet is a joke compared to this place, I'm still a fan of Nando's but this is cheaper, more flavourful and has more unique sides. Def one of my favorite restaurants of all time  *If its your first time here: Get the Chicos Brasa Family Meal, excellent sides are: Yuca Fries, Potato Salad, Reg salad, regular fries are average"}
{"text":"I've only done take out and I would always get the family deal. Portions are a bit lacking but the flavours are so delicious. The different sauces and sides are really good. I always get the fries and the rice as a side.   Expect to wait a while when they're busy so order ahead if possible."}
{"text":"Context: Tuesday evening around 6pm  Atmosphere:   Hip Latino, South American music Spacious room between tables Not busy at the time, about 2-3 occupied tables Mix of takeout and dine in  Food: Got the ceviche: Very sour sauce with large slabs of tilapia, corn, lettuce, a piece of shrimp, and mussels. For $17, quite pricey for what we got. I'm not a big fan of sour anyway so I couldn't really appreciate the dish.   AAA sirloin beef in vinegar sauce (Lomo Saltado ...): good flavour but meat was cut up in strips and lost that nice texture. Served with a side of rice and fries + sautéed red onions. Passable but not amazing. For $18, not worth.  Seafood rice (Arros Mariscos): very buttery with mixture of squid, mussels (not flavourful at all) and trace bits of unknown seafood. Very heavy and filling dish, but on the whole, heavily butter-based. $19.  Finished off with two 1/2 chicken meals at $16.5 each. Both came with a side. We got corn and yuka fries (cassava deep fried fries). Chicken was a tad dry but the best part was the mild/spicy sour sauces. Quite tasty and creamy. Not super filling but should be substantial given the choice of side.   Service:  Very kind service from the younger male who looks to be related to the family running the business. He's in a few of the photos on the wall. However, he didn't clear up leftover dishes promptly, which also led to an aggregation of fruit flies by our dishes. Not the best experience.   Served 5 people with 4 dishes + ceviche to total $98 after tax.  I recommend Nando's for a cheaper and similar tasting experience."}
{"text":"Nice place. The chicken is always fresh and well marinated. We especially like the Yucca fries. We usually take out from this place. The food is always consistent and we've never had any complaints."}
{"text":"Food is great. Small cosy place. I love trying different things and this Peruvian taste is awesome. I love the sandwich with the corn on the side. Oh it's also halal :)"}
{"text":"I have only done takeout but the food here is delicious!!   We got the family combo with rice and yuca fries. Had to wait a bit longer than the estimated wait time but it was worth it. I tried calling them ahead to order but no one ever picked up. The chicken is very moist and flavourful and kind of reminds a bit of churrasco chicken. The yuca fries are really addictive. The best part was the chicken dipped in the homemade sauce. I liked to mix the mild and hot sauce together. If made for an interesting blend of flavours. The workers there were also really friendly. Definitely a good place to pick up food after a Costco shop since it's right across the street!"}
{"text":"This place has been open for about 2 months.  I have been there twice.  Service is very good but slow at times and I am totally fine with that because the server is great.  The roast chicken is delicious and so is the steak with fries and onions.  This place will be much better when they get their liquor licence."}
{"text":"A quality chain for Peruvian food! My go to is typically the Chicos Brasa Sandwich with a Peruvian side salad. The sandwich is well assembled with sufficient vegetables and a juicy chargrilled chicken breast. The sandwich comes in either spicy or mild, however, the spicy sandwich is quite manageable. The Peruvian salad is an excellent choice featuring a variety of veggies beyond the Romaine lettuce; tomatoes, avocados, and cucumbers. However, it should be advised to ask for dressing on the side, as the the dressing comes quite heavy if not otherwise specified. The yuca fries are always a worthwhile addition as a side. Fried to just the right amount, they are mealy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The side sauces that accompany them will be useful as the yuca may be dry on their own."}
{"text":"Perfectly seasoned and unbelievably juicy chicken, might be the best chicken I've had in any restaurant.   Their avocado salad dressing is killer, as well.  Great staff makes this a place you want to support."}
{"text":"Love this place, the only place in Toronto where you can enjoy real Peruvian style rotisserie chicken, the yucca frita is delicioso, the lomo saltado is amazing and the leche the Tigre is very good too!"}
{"text":"Had the Friday $12.50 special of two chicken legs, a side and a free drink.  Also added an extra side order of Yucca fries which comes with both mild and hot dipping sauces.  Chose the tumeric infused flavoured rice as my side and an Inca Kola (one dollar extra for this bubblegum tasting beverage) as my drink.  The chicken was both flavourful and moist, the meat nicely infused with the spices that they use.  However, since it wasn't juice dripping, I would probably avoid the drier breast meat options.  The Yucca fries are worth a try if you've never had them before.  Nicely crunchy on the outside with an inside texture that's different from their potato counterpart.  Still, not something I would get regularly given their somewhat expensive $3.49 price tag.  I didn't care too much for the dipping sauces but they might offer some kick for those who like things on the spicy/hot side.  I think the Yucca fries stand pretty well on their own.  Definitely a nice change from the more well known Swiss Chalet and worth a try.  A nice addition to the ethnic culinary line-up of the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"First time trying Peruvian food and I loved it! Comparable to Portuguese food, only better (in my opinion), because it seems to have more flavour.  The smell of barbeque meat greeted us upon entering the restaurant; as to foreshadow how good the food was going to taste.  We ordered 2 quarter chicken dinners. One with fries as the side  5/5 and the other potato salad 5/5. The fries were thick cut and fried to perfection. The potato salad was surprisingly good. Just the right amount of mayo and didn't have the unnecessary veggies. The quarter chicken was tender and seasoned well 5/5. Lost a star here because one of the drumstick served was under cooked, but they brought a new one out (with the thigh). Gave them back the star.  Another star was deducted because they forgot to give us our drinks until after our meal was done. Also, during this visit the place was freezing cold because their heating was broken. Normally, not a big deal but it made the food turn cold real fast.   Overall, good food. Probably would have enjoyed it better in room temperature, but I'll be back. Maybe I'll call in advance for take out next time."}
{"text":"Honestly - was curious and I wont say that I was disappointed.  Although the price was steep- It definitely matched my curiosity .  How can I explain this- A dryer Jerk chicken- not like Nando's or Swiss Chalet or any other chain rotisserie . The sides they have are fabolos and the sauces are great as well.  If you haven't tried it and love flavourful rotisserie- Definitely will try again !!"}
{"text":"The chicken is so. Damn. Good.  I also highly recommend the potato salad.  Unfortunately the last time I went they didn't have any potato salad in stock, but I got more chicken anyway.  The sauces that come with each order are also to die for. (The spicy yellow sauce and tangy cilantro sauce)  Please go."}
{"text":"Their chicken and yuca were delicious!! The servers were friendly as well and checked up on us once in a while. However, our food took a long time to come and the prices were a bit expensive, but I left full and satisfied :)"}
{"text":"Amazing ceviche! Steak pasta is good too, and the sauces that come with are amazing. The chicken though is a tad bit too salty and not as moist as I expected it to be (hence 3 stars instead of 4). Great service though and everything is halal too so added plus!"}
{"text":"Tried this joint seeing as it got many good reviews and here's another one to add to them! The service was great and friendly. We got the chicken sandwich and quarter chicken with yuca fries. No complaints about anything. Chicken was seasoned very well and we absolutely loved their special sauces. Definitely coming here again and bringing other newbies! Yum!"}
{"text":"Was surprised.   Always though this was a take out chicken joint.  Turns out they have a great selection and food was surprisingly great.       Ordered a beef dish with rice fries and veggies.   Also had the seafood dish at he table and was bigger than my girlfriend, can't believe she finished as much as she did being picky with seafood so we can assume it was as surprisingly great.   Full back dining area with attentive staff.     Los Chicos is now on my rotation for eating out.   Only negative I have is my sadness for assuming this was another chicken takeout and not exploring further."}
{"text":"I gave these guys a 4.5 star at their old location (literally just judging their signature chicken) and after my recent visit at this new location I'm gonna bump it up to 5 stars. Incredible meal. Wow. Where to start. Ok first off, when I frequented the old establishment, there weren't very many items on the menu and it seemed like everything centered around the chicken. Now, it is a sit-down restaurant foremost, and then a take out restaurant second (the take out menu pretty much focuses just on the chicken still, you don't see the other interesting items). I highly recommend the sit-down experience.  Two of my best friends are brothers from Lima, Peru and they told me this place is by far the most authentic peruvian joint in the GTA. Anyways, we had a HUGEEEEE spread for a birthday so we got to try a lot of things.  Appetizers: - papa a la huancaina: boiled potatoes in a really delicious cheesy cream sauce - ceviche mixto: SUPER FRESH seafood topped with some red onion and garnished with some roasted corn (very punchy lime taste, just amazing) - anticuchos: OMGGGGGGGG my first time ever trying grilled cow heart. BRUH this dish is life changing. My goodness, I couldn't stop thinking about it the day after. SO TENDER, SO JUICY MMMMM  Mains: - jalea: assorted SUPER FRESH fried seafood (tilapia, calamari, octopus, shrimp, etc.) on a bed of their crispy yuca fries - lomo saltado: soft beef in a unique peppery marinade served with onions, bell peppers and some rice - arroz con mariscos: I've had seafood rice at a bunch of other restaurants and this one is right up there with the rest. Packed with lots of seafood and amazing sauce on the rice. It might be the best bang for your buck because the dish is deep and the portion is very generous (for all you big eaters out there). - pollo a la brasa: THE SIGNATURE CHICKEN. As per my review for the old location, still \"putting that swiss chalet rotisserie to shame!\" Still true. Still super flavorful chicken. Juicy dark meat. Juicy white meat. MMMMM. Homemade Spicy orange sauce and homemade mild minty green sauce to go with the chicken. Side of yuca fries. Heaven.  special of the day (secret menu item): - aji de gallina: strips of chicken in a creamy yellow chilli sauce and served with rice.  Get a 2L inca cola (for sharing) to wash it all down and you have a complete feast. The portions tend to be on the smaller side if you are just ordering for yourself (EXCEPT for the seafood rice) so I would recommend coming with a large group of buddies to share lots of food.  I had considered keeping my new rating at the previous 4.5 or even decrease to a 4 star all because of how expensive they are, but the quality of the food far surpassed my expectations, so I feel that they deserve 5 stars. Even though it is pretty damn expensive (I saw cartoon flies flying out of my wallet afterwards), sometimes you can't put a price on really good food. As an aside though, if these guys were cheaper I'd probably find myself here quite a bit."}
{"text":"So I took my girlfriend here on the suggestion of a friend who's from Lima, Peru. He told me this place was as authentic as it gets.   We came on a sunday afternoon for lunch. Pretty unique setup to this place. If you choose to dine-in, you go to the second floor and await your meal after ordering. The owner's son, kindly took the time to give us his recommendation when we told him it was our first time there. Both my girlfriend and I were feeling rather hungry so we both opted for half chicken meals.   So before I talk about the chicken, the side you guys must try is the yuca fries. It seems like theyre double fried cuz theyre sooooo crispy but mealy on the inside. The salad was aiight imo.  Anyways, DAT GLORIOUS CHICKEN. God, dat glorious bird. My girlfriend and I looked at each other simultaneously when we took the first bite. Absolutely beautiful. Chicken skin bursting with flavour. Succulent, juicy, tender meat. PUTTING THAT SWISS CHALET ROTISSERIE TO SHAME INSTANTLY. And if it you thought it couldnt get any better it did. The sauces they gave you as an accompaniment were homemade. One was spicy the other was mint-based. HEAVENLY BITES. When I return I'm ordering a whole chicken with extra sauce for myself I don't care. Did I mention the staff are also sooooo pleasant? Only slight con, is it's kinda expensive (but sooooooooo worth it). HERE, TAKE MY BUSINESS DAMNIT!"}
{"text":"We went here after a tiring weekend of camping and not wanting to cook. The fiancé and I both ordered the quarter leg combo with two sides each; yuca fries, rice, corn, and fries.   The chicken was done to perfection. Cooked beautifully and seasoned with just the right amount of flavour and spice. The chicken legs were so juicy and fresh. You can tell they are constantly cooking up more chickens because there wasn't a single dry bite.   Yuca fries were interesting. They tasted like the fries' drier and harder cousin. There were a few hard stringy pieces in them that I couldn't eat. There were also some pieces that were too big to eat and I was a bit turned off from how greasy they looked from being in a big ball form.   Fries were standard. Frozen McCain fries that don't warrant their own review.   Corn was plain grilled corn. I couldn't detect any seasoning on them, which is what I was hoping for. Had I known they were plain, I would have chosen a different side.   The rice was really good. It was seasoned with turmeric and bright yellow. It was our favourite side of the night and I would totally get it again.   My biggest gripe with my experience here is that my quarter chicken was significantly smaller than my fiancé's. There should be a bit more consistency with the portion of their plates.   One thing I really appreciated was the service. I didn't expect any and people were bringing us our plates and checking to make sure our meals were good. Customer service is top notch and everyone is very friendly."}
{"text":"I don't know anything about Peruvian food, but I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Los Chicos Brasa. It's a small, casual place so don't expect anything fancy. The chicken (which is touted as the restaurant's specialty) was okay for me, but their ceviche was the highlight of our night."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  We came here from a recommendation from an acquaintance.  So glad we tried it out.  We always order the Ceviche and the chicken.  The portions are huge so be prepared to share the food.  If you order the ceviche, ask for the sea food mix. This is our favourite.   The fried squid looks yummy but you need a few extra people to share this. Again the portion is very big.  This is our go to place for Peruvian food."}
{"text":"The fam and I have been getting take out from Los Chicos consistently over the past couple months while our house is being renovated. My dad is basically addicted to all their sauces. I also love their yuca fries and fresh salads (NOT premade with that bagged horror I have seen elsewhere). Service is usually very quick and polite. Can I also give an extra star for the two cute guys who are always working there? *fans face* is it hot in here???...  On another note, it is exremely warm in the order area! It feels like you are IN the oven with the chicken. So maybe the two cuties are only half the cause. Luckily, I have never encountered a line at 7pm when I am there for pick up so I am in and out in 5min or less if I call ahead.  I do notice some consistency issues with Los Chicos' food. On a few occasions, our chicken or bread comes overcooked. Some parts of the chicken will be a bit charred or our toast is more like a cracker. Other times, the yuca is dry and tough (an indication of older produce).   When it's good, it's REALLY good at Los Chicos. 5/5! The chicken is usually very juice and the fried yuca is addictively succulent and a bit salty. I will still be going back. I am sure these guys can fix these small issues. Oh and open a window in there! :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a quite a few times and I would confidently recommend this place to anyone in the mood for rotisserie chicken, Here's why:  1) Good Food Moist  chicken, seasoned just perfectly ( not too much, not too little). Everything I got served was always fresh. I hate being served anything stale and this has never happened here.  I Love their Yuca Fries. Its a crunchier, slightly sweeter type version of regular French fries but its not made from potatoes but from  a root called Yuca which is also known as Cassava in different countries.  Not a huge fan of their salad, but it has avacados, yummmmm  3) Generous portions, always a filling meal. And I'm sure its better than the chicken places nearby and it cost a bit less too, so that's a bonus. I've never ordered a huge family meal type thingie but I think they have even better promos on those, for you take out type people.  4) Great service, always polite and friendly. It's a family run restaurant that appreciates your business and clearly understands how to take care of customers.  They don't hide their tissues, and give you two when you ask. I always ask for more thier homemade sauce (its unique and good). Some restaurants make my sauce obsession awkward, not this place though.   5) Finally I'm confident enough to recommend it with 5 stars because I have gone here on separate occasions with 5+ different people for their first time, and all of them really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Chicken is amazing. Definitely recommanded but there new location has limited parking. I usually get their sandwich which is more than enough."}
{"text":"Pretty good chicken with good seasoning.  Sauces weren't very hot buy were tasty.  The cassava fries were really enjoyable and are something I will be trying at home.  Great to know there is something good to eat on this frequented strip of Markham Rd heading south from the 407."}
{"text":"The place is a bit small for sitting upstairs. But there is a patio outside which is fine. The food was fantastic. I had the quarter Peruvian chicken with two sides(fries and corn). The chicken was juicy and done just right. Fries were just as good. Corn wasn't that great and didn't really go well with the rest of the meal. Overall, great food and service."}
{"text":"Man, this is some fine food here you wouldn't expect in the area. I live here in Markham and went to Chico's the first week it opened up. Super greasy but i loved the taste and the yuka fries were just a game changer for me. Now i recently revisited and they are 300x over refined. When you check in you get a pretty decent coupon ! If you're a local here and dont feel like Chinese/Hakka/Indian or fast food. This place will remind you there is always something new out there."}
{"text":"First off, if you like grilled chicken and a little bit of spice, you should try this place.  Their hot sauces are homemade, green is mild, and the thicker reddish sauce is hot. They are both great.  Their salads, their rice is made daily and fresh.  One tip, lunchtime, they are busy, they seem to be a little understaffed, but their food is consistent."}
{"text":"Summary: the chicken, sauce, and yucca fries are delicious and worth the slightly higher price and somewhat average portion size.  Top Must-Get: half chicken brasa with yucca fries Top Regret: french fries (and parking)  Los Chicos was quite popular among locals in its first location by Markham Rd and 14th in the plaza across Costco - and with good reason: they served, in my opinion, the best rotisserie chicken in Markham. In its new location (right next to Congee Queen), they have the old menu and a new exclusive dine-in menu.  *This review focuses mainly on the takeout side of things* *Tip: takeout is cheaper than dine-in!  FOOD Chicken: the dark meat is juicy, tender, well-flavoured, and borderline addicting. The Peruvian spices/seasoning really hits the spot. Add in their Chico house sauces (comes with every chicken meal) and you've got yourself a winner. The white meat is not nearly as tender (naturally), but still good.  Having said that - the portions lend to the slightly smaller size, so I do recommend the half chicken at minimum (and I'd go with two sides to even begin to try to satisfy those with big appetites...) Having said THAT - this Peruvian taste does not come cheap: half chicken with ONE side goes for about $15+.  Sides: they offer a variety of sides - here's a breakdown.  Rice: yellow rice, standard fare, slightly small portion size. Tastes really good with the homemade sauce.  French fries: seemed to be a little soggy, but I rarely order these, since they have...  Yucca fries: yucca is a root, and they deep fry those roots to crunchy perfection. Worth trying!  They also offer corn (no longer on the cob) and salads (below).  Salads: Their potato salad is on point (4/5), and their Caesar is solid too (3.5/5). They also offer a Peruvian salad, which somewhat resembles a garden salad but with zucchini instead of cherry tomatoes.You can add chicken to any of the salads (totaling around $10) and that brings them to a 4.5/5  Sandwiches: they taste pretty good! The meat is fairly juicy, and they pack some of their sauce into it, so that's always tasty. I'd recommend the half chicken meals over this in general though. (3/5)  SERVICE  Expect friendly folks who are always smiling. Sometimes they get pretty busy, so expect at least 15-20 minutes to order. This is NOT fast food.  Their dine in menu is considerably different with many more options, including seafood and beef. You cannot ask for the dine in options as takeout, which is a bit unfortunate.   You don't come here for a cheap and quick meal with giant portions. This is the place for a really tasty meal to satisfy a rotisserie style chicken craving in a local, authentic Peruvian restaurant.  Ultimately, this is a 4.5/5 for takeout, but closer to 4 for dine-in. Clearer instructions about the take out/dine in separation would be great - we came here one night and it was full, so we tried to get some takeout... But the items we wanted were dine-in only. They make no exceptions, even for a regular like me. That was a little off-putting."}
{"text":"Very filling and gives your appetite a complete feeling. In regards to everyone saying 'great alternative to swiss chalet', its actually the only option in comparison to swiss chalet!"}
{"text":"Update: at the time of this writing, location on google maps is old location.  Check their website for new location.  Delicious!!!  My new go to in the area.  Love the 1/4 dark with Yuca fries and both hot sauces.  Nice to have a side of the Peruvian Salad with it and I'm all smiles and feelin' good!"}
{"text":"I never make it to this part of town way out on East markham so when a friend invited me for lunch there I had very little expectations.  The spot is at a little corner of the mall with very little space to eat outside but the chicken is totally worth it.  Got the half chicken combo with the yuca fries and it was so delicious, juicy and fresh with some little dips on the side.  If you ever get there, I recommend you give it a try"}
{"text":"Environment - 3 Stars for the look of the restaurant. First sight walking in seems like a take out area, then back of the store is a restaurant setting.   Customer Service - 2 Stars. I have a thing about judging customer service based on having my glass of water always full.. server walked by many times and I'm sure she saw our emptied glasses but she waited until we requested more... went around 6PM, restaurant wasn't busy... only 2 tables including ours were occupied and one server. Cutlery was already at the table, but mine was dirty so I grabbed it from another table. Server never asked how our food was (it was our first time there so they should really take care of their customers to make sure they become returning customers)   Food - 2.5 stars, chicken was okay in terms of flavor... I could only taste some seasoning on the crisp skin of the chicken, but throughout the chicken it was all salt. Chicken wasn't dry which was good. I was expecting something like Nando's but guess my expectations were too high... yuca was okay- again.. salty (hence why our waters were always empty). Caesar salad was basic with \"homemade\" croutons which were soggy. Hot sauce was actually mild and mild sauce was very bland.    I also read on yelp that their prices went up which gave me a sign that this place would be busy and poppin.. but it wasn't.   Overall, I would come back to this place but as a last resort when craving Peruvian food.."}
{"text":"I've only always ordered take out from this place. There was only one time when my whole chicken was red inside, but other handfuls of times I've gotten food, it was wonderful.  I also go for the yuca fries and the their house salad. great good"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Fresh, delicious, good quality - Los Chicos Brasa is (good) different than other chicken places.    Los Chicos Brasa sells Peruvian chicken - rotisserie grilled served with delicious homemade sauces.  Their side options to choose from are: corn on the cob, basmati rice seasoned with turmeric, potato salad, caesar salad, Peruvian salad (iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and avocado drizzled with a creamy vinaigrette dressing), garlic bread, fries, and yuca (cassava root) fries.    My family came to Los Chicos Brasa and ordered the family combo - one whole chicken with two sides. We used the Yelp special that is usually redeemable after checking in but the owner said that he wasn't sure who put up the special on Yelp - he honoured the special anyway. (Yelp special price was $29.50; regular price is $31.50) For sides, we chose yuca fries and corn on the cob.  The Peruvian chicken was delicious - the whole chicken was smaller than we expected but it had great flavour and was juicy. The homemade sauces that Los Chicos Brasa hss go well with the chicken and the yuca fries. The yuca fries are a definite must-have - they're a bit tougher in texture than regular fries but this adds a nice crunch to them.  They're cassava root which gives a sweet tone and they were lightly salted. The kids loved them and we wished we had ordered more. They're a great first-try.  I definitely recommend this place. Los Chicos Brasa is here to stay as a good competitor against other chicken restaurants."}
{"text":"A better place, very clean and neat compared to the older location. Yuca fries taste awesome and worth it. But the prices change was way to much. Anyways, I recommend this place to everyone. Very taste chickens too."}
{"text":"Having been a big fan of Chicos' original location on Markham road, I was pleasantly surprised to hear them move to a new location with more space.   I definitely had a more comfortable dining experience here and was impressed with their bigger menu but still went for their signature chicken.  I went with the 1/4 chicken breast meal with a Peruvian salad and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was just as good as I remembered it being. The chicken breast was huge and was some of the most juicy and moist chicken I've had. And it was juicy the entire way through! The salad was served with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, avocado and was well dressed in a yoghurt based salad dressing. I loved their two hot sauces and they're to die for!   The main problems I had with the original location was the wait time for the food (it took nearly one hour at one point) and with their pricing. Fortunately there was little wait when I came here to dine-in on a weekday evening and the service was good as we were checked on frequently. The value could definitely be improved as the prices were a bit pricey still.   I'd recommend going for the half chicken which is only a dollar and a half more for an entire leg.  The value simply wasn't there for the 1/4 meal."}
{"text":"I'm really torn about Los Chicos Brasa; on one hand their chicken is phenomenal, on the other the service is all over the place. I'm a food-first, service-second kind of eater, so I still recommend this place. I've been here twice, the first time it wasn't busy and everything was ok but this time, we came here on a Saturday evening and that's when there are problems.   When we arrived there was a lineup, and it took 10 minutes of waiting in line to place an order of which one of the screens showing their main menu was off. In those 10 minutes numerous people left from just waiting. At this point, the first floor of the shop was entirely filled with people waiting, and waiting and yet more people were coming in by the minute. Their operations were really slow, and seemed uncoordinated between the guys there. You could see everything as this place is a counter-serve, at one point nothing was coming out. We didn't even know if we could get a table as we wanted to dine-in. But we did tell one of the guys there and he told us when it was time to go up - after 30 minutes. All in all, by the time we got in the shop and got our food, the total time we waited was 50 minutes, which is definitely on the high side. But is it worth the wait? I would say so but I have to say, I wasn't entirely happy in those 50 minutes. So just a heads up.   Okay, now onto the chicken, it was amazing. I got the quarter chicken with white meat (+$1.00) and yucca fries as the side. It was some incredibly tender and juicy chicken with some magic spices, so it was really flavorful as well. They say it's charbroiled, it is grilled perfectly. It's mouth-watering to think about it, even the day after I ate it.. I'm not kidding! The yucca (cassava) fries were also great; it actually tastes very much like potato but with only with a different texture. It also has a slight bitterness to it but it's so subtle. And then there's their homemade hot sauces which are ridiculous. I didn't find them spicy at all but I swear you can almost drink that stuff. Douse your chicken in it, dip your fries, enjoy. Only one problem, you will probably need more than they give you :) I didn't expect any service as this is more like a self-serve place (plus no tips were given) but we were served pretty decently actually. We were given utensils, were served water (ask for tap water), and they took our plates at the end. Not too shabby at all. It certainly made up for that ridiculous wait.   Overall, Los Chicos Brasa has some amazing chicken and I can't deny good food. If you're willing to wait a while for your food, then come here."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic first time experience at Chicos! I don't think I will ever want to eat at Swiss chalet again! absolutely delicious perfectly grilled marinated chicken! We took advantage of the family meal combo and decided to order the Peruvian  salad and yuca fries both were fantastic and I definitelyprefer the  yuca over normal potato french fries! So crispy and delicious! It came with two kinds of hot sauce both are so tasty with the perfect amount of heat for me!we met the owner and his family Who run the restaurant and they were lovely people and extremely accommodating! I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Nice little fast-food joint still in their opening stages. The chicken is moist and flavourful, the yuca fries are really good. Their sauces may be a bit too spicy, (more spicy than hot wing sauce) unless you really enjoy the heat. All their other sides are just mediocre."}
{"text":"They're moving to McCowan & Highway 7."}
{"text":"Mildly over priced and \"NOT\" Licenced-no alcohol. Server was very friendly and helpful. The ambience was nice with Spanish (Peruvian music?) in the back ground. We ordered the Papa a la Huanciana (cold steamed potatoes) with a pepper sauce. Very tasty. We then had the Peruvian salad personal size which was good.  I had the Lomo Saltado which was garlicy and salty. I was hoping that the white jasmine rice would help quell the saltyness but The white rice which came with it was also super salty. My wife ordered the 1/2 chicken with yuca fries. The chicken was tasty but the skin was super salty also. And the yuca fries were good. It was crunch not soggy and not greasy, kinda like a really firm potato. No hot drinks like coffee or tea either. We tried the deep fried Picarones. It was very good"}
{"text":"This is authentic Peruvian chicken. Well, at least that's what a friend of a friend (who is actually Peruvian!) claims. Needless to say, I jumped at the chance to eat here when I was in the neighborhood with the aforementioned friend.  I had the standard chicken option with a side of the yuca fries. The chicken was incredible. It's jam-packed with flavour and every bite is finger-licking good. It puts the rotisserie chicken option from your average diner to absolute shame. However, I was most impressed with the yuca fries here! It's fried to an absolute crisp and has a small tinge of sweetness that adds so much to the experience. It's definitely not the healthiest option in the planet, but if this isn't an issue, I would wholeheartedly recommend it.  Try this place. I can guarantee that you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Given the choice between Nandos in the plaza next to it and this, I would definitely choose this! why? - The food is good, on par with Nandos. - The include the skin in the grilled chicken and grill it till it is crispy(YUM) - Sort of family owned by a Peruvian person, the service is very friendly, the kid who brings the food to the seating area was very helpful as well."}
{"text":"I eat at Chico's every weekend, I'm a regular now. I usually get the family meal for my whole family, with yuka fries and potato salad.  Chico's is so good I just keep coming back. Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"They have the best chicken sandwich ever and i'm in love with the green sauce that they have!they recently changed their location to highway 7,which is farther from my house but i would never complain if i have to drive there for 1hour"}
{"text":"Glad that this place has a sit down area.  Los Chicos Brasa focuses on the popular Peruvian seafood, chicken and grilled options.  Their menu has a good selection, not too big, as they can focus on quality of the dishes they serve. For drinks Jen had the Inca Cola - creme soda, unfortunately this place doesn't have an alcohol license so no Pizco sour for me :(   For food we were feeling adventurous and opted for the Jalea- a HUGE....HUGE assortment of fried seafood on a bed of yummy Yuca fries served with a spicy salsa creme on the side.  Peruvian Chicken Salad- presentation was great, what made this salad was the chicken itself, quite flavorful and portions were sufficient for both of us.   Overall the ambiance is nice, service was great, menu options were good, however some aspects of the menu seemed pricey....$17 for a ceviche. hmmm lol."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoy this place. Staff is very friendly. Feels very family style. The upstairs dining area is very small and quiet, but no complaints there. The food is very good, I highly recommend the Peruvian salad! But the portions are a little small."}
{"text":"My favourite chicken place.  Food is absolutely delicious.  Only reason I didn't give 5 star because takeout service is quite slow, so plan ahead."}
{"text":"We catered our party with Chicos and our guests were raving! The chicken was top quality, seasoned perfectly. The rice was delicious and a welcome change from the standard side. But the best part - the sauces. These were absolutely to die for!! I wish they would bottle and sell this!!  In terms of service, our food was ready on time, packaged easily for serving, and the manager was extremely friendly. We could not recommend this restaurant enough."}
{"text":"Best hidden gem in Markham. Puts Swiss Chalet to shame....as well as all the other food places in the same plaza as well.  Moist flavourful chicken...all the way to the bone. Great choice of sides. Super friendly service. You pay for what you get....worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Portions are really small. But very tasty chicken and the sauce was amazing! Yuca fries were interesting but not worth the money for just a few pieces."}
{"text":"Love love love the rotisserie chicken, yucca fries (my fav), and salad. Tried restaurant eat in and above items just as good. However...service was really slow. And I did not like the seafood platter at all...  I'll stick to takeout service."}
{"text":"This was the first and definitely NOT the last Peruvian joint I'll be eating at!! Amazing food and impeccable service! You really need to give these guys a try, they will NOT disappoint! GUARANTEED!"}
{"text":"Very tasty chicken and rice! Service was super too! I've never had Peruvian food before, and it was super flavorful! I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Since visiting Peru a few years back, I've been searching for a good Peruvian restaurant here and Los Chicos Brasa is the best and most authentic one I've had so far. I know it's more knowm as a chicken place but we chose to skip it's signature dish and go for the more \"authentic/traditional\" Peruvian meals. Standouts were:  - Ceviche: strong lime taste with mild spice, and the seafood they used was really fresh - Lomo saltado: really tender beef and tasty marinate - Jalea: deep fried seafood goodness that's great for table sharing - Arroz con mariscos: generous heaping of rice with just a generous heaping of seafood   The only thing missing was a pisco sour (which would've been perfect for the meal), but I guess you can never go wrong with Inca Cola hehe. Anyway, if you want a taste of Peru, highly recommend going to this place, maybe even skipping it's signature chicken dish, and go straight to the classic Peruvian cuisine."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Markham! Came here a few times, and each time that I've been here, the food and service were amazing.   Usually get the sandwich with the yucca fries - delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to list this review of their new location so differently than their small little place but ironically it's the little things that are forcing me to do that as something isn't the same from the humble, small take-out place they were on Markham Road, to whatever this is here.  Location:   It's located on Hwy 7 on the north side, just east of McCowen in that area with all of those popular Asian place, and the greek place. If you're looking to find parking, try really hard because parking is terrible here. Almost good to park a few plazas over and walk it's that bad. This place is also now a sit-down restaurant first vs. a take-out place that it used to be. They don't appear to have take-out combos anymore, but they do have a menu to sit and try.  Food:   I wrote a review (review of the day, yay) of their old location where they strictly had a take-out style menu with some seating upstairs for you to stay and enjoy, but the real flare of the place was the food really stood on it's own. Great chicken, yucca frites, and the best part, the ability to buy their Special Green and Orange sauces to take home.  Seriously, I think 50% of the satisfaction from this place comes from the little tiny sauces they give you with your order.  Now having said that, most of the staple items and combos you used to be able to get are either not available OR cost a bit more which added to the already higher cost you'd be paying to eat at a place like this.  Also, whatever it is, the Yucca Frites and Chicken didn't taste as \"fresh\" and my order from here appeared to be overcooked a tad.   The saving grace was the sauces were still fresh, aromatic, and delicious! Bad news? They no longer sell them in jars you can take home. They only give you 1 of each per order and make you pay extra for the rest.   Value:  With the increased prices, cost of finding parking (it takes a while if you come anywhere near dinner time), as well as portion sizes, it's not as amazing as it used to be and that feels like a shame.   Have to give it 2.5 out of 5.0. Hopefully they read some of the other reviews which kind of echo the same thing and maybe implement what they had before at their old shop."}
{"text":"In one line, better than nandos.   This place is small and I wouldn't have noticed it if not for the big sign off Markham road. Having said that my wife has Peruvian heritage and thought that maybe we should bring my MIL there to verify it's authenticity and to sample some of their style of food.   In short, great flavours, fresh and made to order.   Longer story, tis two floors kitchen/take out place on the bottom floor with tables and seating upstairs. The menu is pretty simple, they have a few apps, and sides but the main thing is the chicken cooked in their giant charbroil oven behind them.   Atmosphere:  Upstairs is a  ice place to sit and have a meal after a busy say at Costco or heck just to get away from home for a bit. Authentic Peruvian art pieces and boxes decorate the area. The take out/order desk and kitchen downstairs is smaller than most walking closests so it's amazing how they feel the food they do out. They have a large oven behind them.   The yuca fries are worth getting. They're sliced fresh and fried to order.   The chicken itself has an aroma of something that is very flavourful, spicy, and satisfying. What really puts it over the top is the spicy sauce and mild green sauce. These are very fresh, aromatic and unique. A blend of creamy, spicy and herby that really enhance the chicken and the yuca fries. Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Best roast chicken I've had and they serve it with little home made mild and hot sauces. The mild is avocado based. They have limited seating upstairs and I find the chicken tastes better when you eat it there rather than take it home. I love the rice. My wife loves the Yuka. It can get slow when busy but the staff is generally nice."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but man oh man - price doesn't meet quality or expectations. The food is a 6/10 at best. Ordered the half chicken and the chicken was ok at best. I don't see what the hype is all about. Or was about as from I understand the reviews on this place have tanked.   Friendly staff - but they need to appeal to their clients. They need to provide good food at reasonable prices. I can name a list of 20 better restaurants (granted not in the area) that will shame this place.   Neither their food or prices lived up to my expectations."}
{"text":"Maybe -0.5 stars for slowness.  Came on a Saturday night, and was told there'd be a 30 min wait. They have a takeout section too, but we decided to wait because I thought 30 min wasn't too bad, and the takeout menu was limited anyway. Unfortunately it ended up being closer to 50-55 minutes.   Ordered Ceviche Mixto, Anticuchos (skewered beef heart), and Double Leg Brasa Chicken (with side of yuca fries). The food itself was pretty good. The fish in the ceviche seemed fresh, and the strong citrus was refreshing. The beef hearts were grilled well, served with a slightly spicy/tangy sauce. The chicken was juicy and delicious and accompanied with crispy yuca slices and two other sauces.  Overall food was good, price was reasonable and the service was actually friendly. It was just unfortunate the wait in the beginning took quite a bit longer than expected with no real explanation or updates while waiting at the front."}
{"text":"First time eating at their new location. Nice place. Crappy parking lot, not enough spaces.  The chicken was good but I couldn't help feeling like they've lost a little bit of that magic. It wasn't as flavourful as it was at the old location. Maybe the oven needs to be seasoned a little more? The yucca fries were awesome, as usual. Their prices went up. Too bad.  I'll be back but I hope they rediscover the magic."}
{"text":"If you like BBQ or rotisserie chicken, you'll love the chicken from Los Chicos Brasa! It's cooked over real charcoal for that extra flavour. And you have to try the yuca fries with it - crispy and light. The hot sauces add just the right amount of heat and a little extra flavour boost.   This location appears to be take-out only but they have a small dining room upstairs and a small patio as well. Prices are reasonable. Service is very friendly and informative.  I'm looking forward to the opening of their 2nd location near McCowan and Hwy 7."}
{"text":"Ordered the double leg deal ($1.50 extra) and split it with my date. We dined in. The eating area upstairs is rather tiny. I am not exaggerating either. There are a few tables and the poor server has to run up and down the stairs to bring you your food and drinks. One washroom. Ordered the yuca fries with rice. The food was so tasty. The yuca fries are nothing like potatoes and dipping it in the two sauces is BOMB! The rice has tumeric so it has a kick. The chicken was good but I wouldnt say its way better than the other chicken places. Overall, I would come again for the sides!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found a Peruvian place. It was definitely way smaller than I thought. Definitely not a restaurant. They make some awesome chicken. And obviously can't get enough of that inca kola."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my brother. A little background, I grew up in South America and I used to live in Miami so I'm quite comfortable with latinoamerican food... I am quite please with the fry yucas! Chicken were really good including their Peruvian salad. I discovered that their owner and majority of the worker are Canadian born Peruvian so they spoke Spanish as well so I was able to communicate in Spanish with them as well. They have loud music playing in their local restaurant and they do have a lot of sitting in the back as well, the place isn't fancy but it's very casual, i saw people coming in for take out a lot. Do I recommend this place? If your looking for some good chicken then sure! I think it taste pretty good. The place didn't get 5 stars is because their pricing was quite high for their menu and the portion isn't as big as it can be as others Peruvian places. If you want something as tasty as this I can recommend you elsewhere in which also have nice chicken as well(through pm since this is not appropriate to name another restaurant while reviewing them)I might come back for the lomo saltado in the future."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place - called in an order for takeout, was told it was an hour wait. Got there an hour and 15 minutes later, because it was hard to find the place at night - it's tucked away in the corner of a large plaza - and to my surprise, the 2 gentlemen outside the building  informed me they had given my food to someone else! Left disappointed and hungry.... Don't let this happen to you!!! #customerserviceFAIL"}
{"text":"My Orders: whole/half chicken with yuca fries and peruvian corn   Pros + Sauces: I'd come here just for the sauces. They're tangy, spicy, sweet. So good.  + Clean  + Ambiance: upbeat, bright, modern  + Delivery: $4 surcharge  + Lunch specials: buy 5, get 1 free!   Cons - Why dont you have more locations!!  - Restrooms: why dont you have more than one!  This is my go to when I want something quick and yummy (when I'm in the GTA of course). The yuca fries are a bit heavier than regular fries but its a good kind of different."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty and it feels fresh but their portions are a bit small, especially when you order ceviche, there is not much sea food on it. The place is clean and their service is very good."}
{"text":"The chicken at this place is awesome!  I had the double leg meal with the yuca fries. I highly recommend the yuca fries if you haven't tried them before! All that being said however, I find the service to be lacking. My family made a reservation for 7pm, but still ended up waiting 15 minutes before we were seated. Granted, it was a pretty busy Sunday evening, but I'm not sure why it took them more than 17 minutes (plus reminding one of the servers) to bring us water. They also got my order wrong and gave me the half chicken meal at first, but that was quickly fixed. To summarize, come for the chicken (do the takeout option!) and not the dining experience."}
{"text":"Good food but extremely slow service. Wait time for a meal is way too long. I've come more than once thinking maybe it was just the day I came but it continued. I came three times and it takes at least an hour to get your meal. If you come order to go don't stay or you'll wait hours."}
{"text":"Bought: 1 whole chicken  with potato salad and hot sauce. $25 with taxes.  Came in at 9:15 pm.  There were 6 orders in front of my order.  It was a busy night!  When the guy packed my potato salad into a plastic container, he touched a protruding potato with his bare hands!!!!!  Unprofessional, indeed!  The potato salad was extra savoury nonetheless ;)  The chicken was just ok.  Costco's roasted chicken at $7.99 tastes better!  Best to order when they are not so busy that they forget to put hand gloves :("}
{"text":"Its a small cozy place with seats upstairs and outside on picnic tables. The main floor is where all the magic happens and where you can put in your order. Went with the Friday special - double chicken leg with one side and a drink for $12.50. Decided to get rice with my side. The chicken itself is super tender and juicy. The meat would almost fall off the bone as you bite into it. Portion of rice is a bit small for me but gets the job done. The only complaint I can make is that the chicken is really really salty - (Yes, two really's for super salty). Other than that the flavours were great.   If you want some good rotisserie chicken then this is the place check out. Swiss Chalet step aside because you got competition that does it way better. Its so obvious I don't like Swiss Chalet :)"}
{"text":"We decided to try a different flame grilled chicken spot aside from our usual (Very Peri Chicken in Scarborough, which is 5* food , hands down) and unfortunately we're extremely disappointed with the overall experience. When we arrived, we had to wait 10 minutes before getting seated. When walking to our table, we noticed that 70% of the tables were empty so there was no reason not to have seated us. The servers did the bare minimum - they took our order and weren't seen again afterwards. The food portions were mediocre... compared to Very Peri Chicken which is a very similar restaurant, this place charges a premium for food that doesn't taste very good. Safe to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"I used to live in Northern Virginia, where there are a ton of Peruvian Chicken places, and pretty fierce competition. This one could certainly hold its own there.   For those unfamiliar, Peruvian chicken is rotisserie grilled, so you're getting something along the lines of Swiss Chalet or Nando's (there's one nearby.) They've got a number of different options for 1/4 chicken and 1/2 chicken combos, with a lot of great sides. I would recommend getting a 1/4 chicken, because the amount of sides they give (particularly the yuca fries) are enough to feed two people.  I had yuca fries and corn with my chicken. I had asked for potato salad at first but they were mostly out of it, but they gave it to me anyway for no charge. Lee also got a 1/4 chicken and he got caesar salad, which wasn't remarkable but was still pretty decent. The chicken comes with two aji (similar to Argentinian chimichurri) sauces, one mild, and an amarillo sauce that is a bit spicier. I really loved the spicy sauce, it was great for dipping fries into.  The dining area is upstairs from the ordering area, and they bring the food up to you. The staff was really friendly and very proud of their food. One of the guys, when I was asking about the pepper used in the amarillo sauce, mentioned that his dad was down in Peru recently and found a new pepper that they're going to be using to boost the spice level in their sauces.  So all in all, a great meal and a friendly place."}
{"text":"Looking for a place other than chinese or Indian in the area, here's a pretty good Peruvian chicken place that's very authentic....chicken is kind of small compared to Swiss chalet or Costco but it's seasoned well, yuca fries were kind of salty, also got the chicken wrap which was delicious, very filling and kind of spicy, they give u the green and red sauce which is very spicy  Will come back and try other stuff"}
{"text":"I came here because I'm Peruvian, and I have to say the chicken was excellent. The anticuchos were also pretty good. Unfortunately, the rest of the food was not up to par. The ceviche seemed to have been prepared from defrosted fish, not fresh at all, and the first set of yucca fries that we got were cold and stale. The hub also ordered a salad which he refused to touch after the first bite. Also, the service was very slow, and there were not a lot of customers there. Maybe they are still working on it, maybe it's all part of growing pains, but you have to have fresh food! Or just stick to the chicken. May come back in a few months."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews but I felt this place does not deserve 3 stars and felt the need to share my awesome experience. Actually,before coming here on Tuesday, I hesitated to go because of the bad review. Since I had already made plans to meet with friends, I decided to go anyway. I AM SO GLAD I DID!!!   FOOD WAS AMAZING! Chicken was made fresh! Contrary to the previous review, it was moist and juicy, well-seasoned unlike bland Swiss Chalet. The \"Aji Verde\" or the spicy sauce that goes along with the chicken was something my taste buds have never explored before. It's like having  an explosion of flavours and fresh seasonings in your mouth. The sauce really complimented the chicken. I could seriously DRINK it!!! Make sure you ask for lots when you come in! As our side dishes, we ordered rice, yuka fries (cassava fries) and corn. The rice was our 20 month old's favourite, he ate it on it's own and it was very tasty and fragrant. I'd highly recommend you try the rice on your first visit! Yuka fries also came with the spicy sauce and was also yummy! Our combo came with 4 mini cupcakes that had milk caramel inside or Dulce de leche as Hispanics would call it. Also so so good!  Anyway since our Tuesday visit, I craved for Los Chicos again on Wednesday...ignored the craving out of guilt lol and ended up ordering a family combo yesterday (Thursday). Now it's Friday and I've just eaten the rest of the family combo for breakfast and again for lunch! So you can say I'm hooked! lol but I don't feel bad because I am pregnant and the baby really enjoys it too!   Thank you Los Chicos, we will definitely be back for more! I can also tell that you guys really care about your patrons so thank you for that!  One thing I'd like to add to improve the place : Please bring the Latin music upstairs as well and maybe some latin inspired pictures/decor on the walls? Just a suggestion! :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here just now with my mother, we ordered the tuesday special (1/4 chicken with one regular side and drink for 8.50). The chicken was amazing! The meat was soft and juicy and the skin was crispy and so flavourful! When combined with the sauces it was mind blowing.   The yucca fries are just adictive. I had to order more to go. I'm absolutely stuffed but I know I have the chicken and fries in the kitchen and I still want to go eat them...  The two men who were working there were really nice too, cheerful and friendly. I'll definitely be going back again soon."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new and different from our usual family friday dinner. This is our first experienced having peruvian food.   At first I thought it was only for take out. The front serves take out which offers only different Pollo a la brasa(rotisserie chicken) options. But after the take out counter, there is a small walkway that leads to the sit down area. There was no line up but the place is filled. Place is small, clean and modern  with wall to wall of art. One side showing panoramic scenery of Machu Pichu.   A simple menu with appetizers, salads, sandwiches, chicken and main courses. We decided to order double leg Pollo a la brassa, Arroz con Mariscos and Jalea. First came Jalea which is a huge serving of battered deep fried tilapia fish, shrimp, squid on top of yuca fries(cassava) which has 2 dipping sauce(spicy and sweet herb) . I love the crispiness of the yuca fries dipped in the sweet green herb sauce. Then came Pollo a la brasa which smells very appetizing. Charbroiled and marinated with spices, very tasty. Lastly, my favorite is the Arroz con Mariscos, it is similar to seafood paella but more spicy.   Service is great! Our server is very friendly, she checked up on us a couple of times and made sure we are taken care of."}
{"text":"This is the tastiest chicken we've ever had!  Forget Swiss, St Hubert's and Nando's - this is by far superior.  From the quality and taste of the chicken to the unique sauces... The yucca fries are fantastic!!  Make sure that along with their chicken, you try their super-tasty rice, salad and the yucca fries (and the green avo sauce that comes with).  Recommend recommend recommend! We'll be coming here all the time now and tell everyone we know!!  :D"}
{"text":"Not as good as before. What happened? Chicken wasn't as tender and juicy, hot (orange) sauce was a bit fermented (maybe sat out too long?). Green sauce was still great. Avocadoes in salad were all brown (oxidized and/or overripe) and tasteless. Rice was good but not like before - had lots of lumps of seasoning or something in it that made it look less appealing. I hate to say it, but you guys need to step up the quality to what is used to be. It is noticeably lesser in quality."}
{"text":"Was unimpressed by the chicken it was no different then the chicken you could buy at Walmart or Costco the sauces is what makes it different the fries were old no amount of ketchup could save it Been here 3 times as a friend for some reason keeps coming back for there sauce"}
{"text":"Great chicken that is seasoned perfectly.  The hot sauce is the bomb and give a you a great kick.  Yukka fries are great and crispy. A little pricey and hard to find though."}
{"text":"I used to go to Los Chicos Brasa religiously (almost daily) at its former location, which was a lot more convenient for me. It's new location is probably better for their business being in a busier intersection, but that plaza has terrible, limited parking which is shared with a number of other larger restaurants. The inconvenience factor costs it a star.  Other than that, it's a terrific place. The family and folks that runs the restaurant are friendly, and the service (takeout, I've never eaten in) is great. The chicken and homemade sauces are DELICIOUS. The roasted Peruvian chicken is flavorful and juicy - and the mild and hot sauce are terrific. Yuca fries are also great with the sauce.   I think prices have gone up a bit since they've moved to the new location (in that they no longer have daily specials with sides), which is a shame (unless they brought it back since the last time I tried it at the new location few months ago). But it's definitely still worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Went to Los Chicos Brasa last night. I had the Caesar chicken Brasa special and my wife had the wrap. The person at the counter was very friendly and helpful. We went and sat upstairs and the staff brought us the food when it was ready. The seating area is nice and the right size. The food was well cooked and tasted great. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Stopped by for take out.  Ordered the chicken wrap (wednesday special) that comes with a side and a drink.  It was a nice size (not too big, not too small).  It tasted great put I did have a small piece of bone on a piece of chicken.  I had a peruvian salad as my side and it was great with the dressing.  The girl at the counter was friendly and it did not take too long to prepare the meal.  Will probably go again and eat in."}
{"text":"Very good food. The Lomo Saltado is excellent. The chicken is quite delicious. The staff are friendly and welcoming. No liquor license so hope they resolve that. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS BASED PURELY ON THE SERVICE FOR TAKEOUT.  We ordered a family meal that included 1.5 chicken, 3 large sides, 6 sauces and garlic bread (written on the menu).  We chose rice for one of the sides and we noticed that the rice they were scooping out looked about as moist as the Sahara desert. So naturally, we asked if there were any fresh rice. They told us it will be a 4 min wait. Cool, 4 minutes as opposed to eating dust particles. We'll take that.  Meanwhile, our next side, a Caesar salad, was prepared quite sloppily, a box of lettuce with dressing on the side and no cheese. We asked about the Parmesan cheese (which their menu clearly stated the salad would include) and were told \"the cheese is in the dressing\". Guess every other place on earth has been making Caesar salad wrong!  The best part: the menu stated the meal would include garlic bread, which we weren't given, so we asked about it. We were told they didn't have enough bread. So we asked if we could supplement the bread with something else.   \"Garlic bread is complimentary.\"   Well, why did you put it on the menu then? The employee who told us that was clearly pissed off we had asked them for fresh rice instead of the desert sand they had tried to pass off as rice and decided to not give us something we had paid for and included with the meal. Didn't know speaking up for your rights as a customer would have you penalized.  TL:DR: BAD SERVICE. RICE DRY AF. If you try to speak up for the quality of your meal you will be rudely treated and have parts of your meal omitted as revenge."}
{"text":"Some of the best chicken I have ever had! Beats Swiss Chalet rotisserie chicken anytime. It it so perfectly seasoned and moist. Never overcooked or too salty the two times I have eaten it. The yucca fries are delicious! I don't order any sides except for these! I recommend checking out this place at least once. It's on the pricier side but I'd say it's worth it once in a while!"}
{"text":"Really good chicken and great portion sizes.. If you are looking for something different then Swiss Chalet I'd definitely recommend this place.."}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm so happy they have moved to a larger location.  I use to go to their older location for take-out simply because there was so little room to eat in.  Their food is delicious, and my family has always enjoyed it.  The server was extremely friendly and helpful.    The one and only thing I would change is that I wish they were licensed to serve alcohol.  Would've only dinged 1/2 a star, but whole star ratings only."}
{"text":"Nice small place. A little different from a regular restaurant. You go in, order at ground level and then you eat upstairs. Food looks good. Will update later."}
{"text":"They will have a new regular customer. This place is way better than Nando's. They have daily specials. We had the chicken wraps, yuca, and fries. The chicken is delicious and cooked just right. Try the yuca! The fries are just like Costco fries. The two guys who served us were very nice. I think the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food, best rotisserie chicken I ever had at a restaurant. Better than Nandos. The beef stir fry is really good as well."}
{"text":"I would give this place a something between a 3.5 and a 4. Here's why: The chicken was amazing! Every well cooked and flavoured. Service was friendly and FAST! Rice was well seasoned and tasted very good.   The Yuka fried tasted good, but too many left a strange after taste - its probably an acquired taste.   The upstairs seating needed air conditioning - we sat outside in the patio because it was too hot inside.   Bottom line Chico's Chicken and a great place for juicy, flavourful chicken! Will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting from Denver, Colorado and we were excited to find a Peruvian restaurant in Toronto. We ordered a ceviche mixto and lomo saltado, the presentation was beautiful and the dishes looked very appetizing. However, when I took a bite of the ceviche, my tastebuds were dumbfounded with the high level of acidity...I wasn't a fan. I asked for a side of huancaina sauce to mix with the ceviche but the sauce didn't have any flavor, it was just a cream but it needed salt and ají amarillo. There is good news though, the lomo saltado lived up to the appearance and it was rather tasty."}
{"text":"Simply put, this place blows bigger joints like swiss chalet out of the water! We ordered takeout as we were in a rush but there is some space to eat both indoors (weather permitting of course) and outdoors. One of the owners did mention that a move to a larger unit is on the way which is good. More space to eat!  Walking in, I felt that the price was slightly steep but, in retrospect, it was well worth it. My family chose the largest option (mega meal) and we got our moneys worth in food- both in quality and quantity.   The food here is amazing. The chicken is so juicy, no matter which part you are eating. The seasoning, though I can't identify everything in it, is very tasty. For your convenience, it is cut into pieces before it is served which makes it easier to dig in once you get home. If you'd like, make sure to use the sauces they provide. Generally speaking, a dipping sauce is always nice to have with chicken. Albeit, it is definitely not something you need in order to enjoy this chicken.   For our sides, we got:  1) Potato salad- My Mom is always a fan of potato salad and she really liked this one. Chunks of soft potato and not too heavy on the mayonnaise. Perfect. 2) Rice- Standard basmati rice. Nice and light with an appealing yellowish colour.  3) Yuca- As described on the menu, its similar to potato. It is cut into pieces similar to french fries, just larger. I have never tried yuca but I think this was a pleasant introduction to it. 4) French fries- These fries were a little bit on the soggy side. Lucky for me, this is actually how I prefer my fries. If you like crispy fries, it may be a safe practice if you let them know.   You can bet that I will be back here for food again in the future. It was some damn good chicken!   Good job Los Chicos Brasa!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a half chicken dinner with two sides - fries and rice. It was delicious! Perfectly seasoned and served fresh, there were no flaws. While waiting, we were served a sample of yuca (fried cassava) and omg it worked, we ordered a large and they were devoured mmmmm. Fries were great too but the yuca is def the way to go. Complimented the chicken and rice perfectly. Service was impeccable! Thanks for a wonderful first impression; we shall be back often :D"}
{"text":"Small but neat little place in the lesser known east side of Toronto. If you've ever driven on Markham Rd, you most probably would have passed by this place (the place with the red umbrellas outside) without realizing what it is, or seeing it and then forgetting about it.   They have a second floor and a patio, but I wouldn't recommend the patio unless you want traffic noise as music, and dust as a side, since it's right beside the road, unless you're coming at a time where the traffic has totally died down. Their second floor is pretty small... like small. There's around 5 tables? maybe? and they're not big ones (hence not a great place for large groups unless you're sitting outside...). It is however more quiet than sitting downstairs or on the patio, and you get a teeny bit of privacy if you're ever here with a date. The bathroom however is in the same room... with a door of course.  Their menu is not huge but a good size, which is fine because you really just need the main stuff from this place. Their chicken is very flavourful and not overly dry; sauces are also quite yum and goes along perfectly with their dishes - could easily rival that of bigger chains like Swiss Chalet and whatnot. Be sure to ask the cashier for suggestions if you've never had Peruvian food before! Staff there are very friendly.  Prices aren't too bad, but don't expect it to be like KFC. This place definitely deserves more customers than it already has."}
{"text":"The meat is Halal here. The owner told me that he gets the meat across the way, from the grocery store called Sunny's.  I had a ceviche on Sunday. That is the only day they offer it. It was $15 flat before taxes. You get a hefty serving of raw fish seasoned and marinated in the Peruvian Way. Along with it comes half of a corn on the cob, mussle, and roasted Peruvian corn. Yes I would say it is worth the $15. This ceviche was served to me the way that it was served in Lima Peru.  It is a walk-in place where you can put your order in but they also have and seating area upstairs that can seat 20 people. The washroom is also found up there. The place is decorated in modern decor.  I recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I'm extremely disappointed in this restaurant. We paid $21 and got two scrawny leg quarters that were somehow still undercooked, and two vinegary tasting potato salads. P.s. they know the prices and combos on their website or false and they do not update it.  The website says you get a leg quarter with 2 sides and now you only get a leg quarter with one side and for more money.  I told them they need to update their website if they know the info is false, and they were dismissive like they dont care. Fuck this business, man.  That was maybe only worth $10 and I wouldn't even be happy to pay $10 for that terrible meal.  I always like to give a place the benefit of the doubt but this was just ridiculous. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went on the Saturday night.  You call this place Peruvian food?  They should learn how to cook from Aldo's.   the service was terrible asked for water a couple of times and had to wait over 20mins to get it.  Tried the ceviche and it was terrible had no taste.  Chicken wasn't bad but for the price not even worth it.  Go to a real Peruvian restaurant."}
{"text":"So, I believe they have now moved to a new location, but I wanted to review this place before I forget. I started coming here near to when it first opened. I am originally from Lima, Peru, so this pollo a la brasa was like a KFC joint when I was a kid. They had so many chicken places, and they were cheap! Now, when I was a kid, we always bought a whole chicken with fries. This place definitely brought back some memories of my childhood.   As I am a family of 4, we always order the whole chicken and a large side of yucca fries. Traditionally, we eat yucca fries with huancaina sauce, but they didn't make it at the time. The chicken comes with 2 spicy sauces on the side, but I always prefer the green one over the orange/yellow one, which is why we always get extra sauce. A 2-L bottle of inca kola later, and we are set to go home to enjoy our food.   The flavours are very authentic. This is coming from a picky eater who doesn't mess around with Peruvian food. I've had some bad Peruvian food in Montreal before, so trust me...this place is good. Now, pollo a la brasa is considered more of pseudo fast food, but I enjoyed it regardless since it made me think of the flavours I had as a kid. Unfortunately, it is a little expensive, but I don't ever mind paying for good food.   The owners were also very friendly, and they were even more surprised when I started speaking in Spanish. My Spanish is a tad broken since I left Peru when I Was 9, but they were able to understand me, and I even spoke to other customers that were in the store. Among Latin Americans, Peruvians are said to be one of the nicest, and I believe it must be true. They're always happy and ready to make conversation with anyone! Anyways, the food was good and authentic, and that's all that counts. Toronto has some great Peruvian joints, and this is a lot closer to my house."}
{"text":"All of the things I've said in my previous review still holds true - they have great food and warm service; however, some of the things I love of this restaurant has become negative.  If you're getting food here esp at night - CALL IN FIRST!  There's an average of 25-30 minute wait for the food - seriously, I have watched almost half of Warm Bodies on the TV they provide while I was waiting. Secondly is that  a. Their menu is confusing or  b. They ripped me off c. We just didn't understand each other  Yesterday, I came here roughly around 9PM to order: I got the half chicken combo for $14.50 and added a $1.50 for a double leg - my total came up to $20.  On the menu it says: (one half fresh off the rotisserie charbroiled chicken) When I received the food and I left .. I found there was 2 chicken legs in the tray. When I went back in to ask I got flustered (dammit) and they either misunderstood me or I misunderstood them but I was a little too embarrassed to care at that point and just wanted to go home and eat.  I honestly don't think they were trying to rip me off but please read the menu carefully and ask them to clarify."}
{"text":"I would say this is a 3.5 stars rating.   The good: Let's start with the food. I ordered the 2 double leg chicken with yuca fries, ceviche and the anticuchos (beef heart). They were all very delicious, and well seasoned. I loved the 3 dips they provided. I dipped my yuca fries in all of them. The waiter was friendly and helped us when we settled in.   The bad: You should make a reservation because the wait is long! I waited 50 minutes on a weekend to get a table and was told it was a 30 min wait. The anticuchos was just okay and was a bit tough, so maybe I didn't get it on a good day.   I would come back as this is a nice Peruvian restaurant for the Markham area."}
{"text":"Got a chance to try their ceviche and wasn't disappointed! The ceviche is available Sundays and you get a very large serving for $16.95. It comes with corn, yam, and two oysters.   Although the ceviche is very good (excellent flavour, good consistency, and a great vinaigrette), it lacks the same punch that Peru had to offer. Hands down the best ceviche I've had in Canada though so give it a shot!  Foot note: it smells like what you expect (raw fish) so if you're eating it in public, be mindful of those around you lol."}
{"text":"Outstanding food & service.  Love the chicken, sandwiches, sides and you can't have their sandwiches or chicken without the amazing sauces! My only issue is the chicken is SO small, really small for the price."}
{"text":"i came here not knowing what to expect. told the server that it was my first time there and had never had peruvian food before. what i liked next was how passionate he got which told me he enjoys working there and is passionate about it. he advised that the chicken is definitely what you come for, but also recommended a few other options of the menu as well.  we ended up getting the jalea and some other beef kebab type thing to share. the beef kebab was a denser type meet, almost like a liver but not as irony. the jaleo was a mix of deep friend seafood. both come with sides of yucca which at first you might think are fries, but the more you eat, the more you realize, that they are not potatoes. i asked the server about it, he told me what they were and how he likes them more than fries, and even offered a spicy sauce to go along with the yucca.  i had a pretty good experience overall, but the jalea was a bit too monotone for my liking, and the squid was squid was quite dry and rubbery. i will come back to actually try the chicken though."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken hidden in a small plaza!  Even though I have lived in the area for many years - this place to seemed to slip by my radar as I was surprised when I asked the owners that they have been open for 5 years now. They will be moving to a new location by MacCowan and Hwy 7 (in the Congee Queen plaza in about 1 month).  Location: The restaurant is in a plaza where it is visible from the road but you either have to turn in to the complex before or after the place. The first floor is small - basically just an ordering area with a few bar stools. I think there is seating upstairs - on the Friday night they were doing brisk business.  Food: The owner was very friendly and I had asked them for suggestions for 2 people. I ordered the 1/2 chicken combo with 2 sides (fried yuca and peruvian salad). The salad was freshly prepared by the owner which cut everything on the spot - there is nice tart and peppery dressing for it. Great start so far! The fried yuca are sorta like thick and chewy potatoes that were perfectly salted - I like the smaller crispy cuts. But the star of the show has to be the chicken - perfectly cooked with charred crisp skin and hints of pepper. Typically, I always order dark meat or double legs as I find white meat to be be dried out. However, in this case - wow - I took a bite and it was juicy and full of flavour. There was just enough skin and fat to keep the whole thing tasty :). There are two sauces included: a mild green and a red spicy one. The green is sorta like a citrus flavour but my fav has to be the red hot sauce. It was spicy but not overwhelming - a nice kick to it. I ended using it to dip my fried yuca in it.  So - I highly recommend the place as I will be back to try out the other sides. Great chicken for a great price!!! I am super happy they are moving up to Hwy 7 as they will be closer to me for more frequent visits :)"}
{"text":"A hit with the whole family! Loved all the Peruvian flavours including the Inca Cola!! We Loved the rice and yucca fries. The Peruvian salad was sort of bland. We will definitely order from here again!!"}
{"text":"Los Chicos Brasa makes a great roast chicken, and their rice is to-die-for if you're tired of eating plain ol' sticky white rice.  The Yucca fries were not my thing; I tried them, they were deep fried, but I think I'm a potato fan.  They are very similar to sweet potato fries, but less moist.  And the Reggaeton as you wait for your food----if you're a hip-shaking, Daddy Yankee fan, then the Reggaeton is a nice break from the usual Bieber stuff.  Tip: There is a second store opening near Hwy 7 and McCowan soon."}
{"text":"great alternative for chicken other than swiss chalet. I'm glad I gave Los Chicos Brasa a try!!!   The chicken is perfectly seasoned and slowly cooked to perfection, not overly dry or red. The size of the chicken is good too, not like an anorexic chicken that barely had enough to eat.  Sauces they use on the side is a great alternative to gravy. Watch out for the green one, its super spicy!!!  Note: Cash and debit only, even when there's a huge VISA sign on their wall            Looks like a take out place but theres seatings upstairs or outside.            No alcohol.. yet."}
{"text":"I ended up ordering Chicken at Chico's Rotisserie Chicken and it was not on weekend so there's no special items really available.  Whole Chicken Combo with 2 small sides (Rice and Peruvian Salad) - $22.50 - Chicken was a little dry but quite good, I love the sauce on the side which give the chicken extra flavour - Portion is small though... if you are a big eater, you probably can eat the whole chicken combo all by yourself! (I can eat that whole chicken myself....shhh...) - The rice was well flavoured and the salad was fresh!  Service is friendly and excellent. After we ordered our food, it was served to us on real plate and utensils. The only complain maybe the tables upstairs were really filthy, they really need to be wiped down."}
{"text":"What brought the flavours up a notch was the dipping sauces or salsa or whatever the hell that stuff was. My girlfriend got the yuca fries for the side and she loved it. I got the rice, which at first I thought was a bit starchy but it grew on me. It went well with the chicken. The chicken on its own was also very good.  If deciding between Nandos Chicos, or Swiss Chalet (like everyone here is doing) I would definitely go to Chicos. Nando's and Chico's have a similar feel and similar price, but Chicos tastes better and the service is superior.   The seating area is upstairs or on the patio. Upstairs is a little tight. You can hear everyone's conversations... if you're into that.  Also, the kid who helps upstairs is really great. Owners if you see this, give him a raise. He made sure we were taken care of at all times.   Also... surprised someone rated a 3 just because they don't accept credit cards... geez"}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent. There are family options on the menu that filled our family of four plus two friends (four grown ups and two children). The fried yuca, corn and potatoe salad are great sides to the rotisserie chicken. All for a great price."}
{"text":"I am not familiar enough with the Peruvian cuisine to have a frame of reference to tell if the food is authentic Peruvian here, or anywhere.  I can, however, attest that the chicken at Los Chicos Brasa is flavourful and moist..  The spice and taste are unique in the Markham neighbourhood.  It tastes a mix of salt and chilli, balanced by a smokiness that is likely from the roasting.  It doesn't taste too salty to me, though it could be to some.   I dined at the old location before.  I am aware of the small portion of the quarter chicken dish.  For my visit at this location, I ordered a take out of a half chicken with one side ($13.50 plus tax) for dinner.  The chicken portion was slightly smaller than Swiss Chalet, but there was more than enough food for dinner.  I had enough leftover to pack lunch the next day.     The take out service was friendly and fast.  The take out area is spacious and clean.   LCB has my respect that they would open a non-Asian/Halah eatery in the neighbourhood.  Their gut pays off, and mainly because the food sells itself."}
{"text":"Food 3 stars.  Services +0.5 star.  We ordered 2 quarter chicken dinners, one with dark meat (leg) and the other with white meat (breast and wing).  The food was pretty good.  The breast was not overcooked, which I was impressed.  The flavour was salty and had a light charred taste.  The saltiness sipped through the skin and went to the top layer of the meat as well.  Impressive and delicious.  I like food salty, yet I would suggest you to not eat the skin if you are not used to bold saltiness.    The chicken used were the fryers, so the meat was tender, though the portion would be small.  I guess you can't have best of both worlds.  Next time I will order a half chicken meal just for myself, making it a slightly expensive lunch.  Yap, you are forewarned about the portion now.  For sides, we had salad and rice.  I really liked the rice.  It tasted salty and some other flavours that I couldn't identify.  The salad was fresh and the portion was reasonable.  Upon walking in, the layout is a take out joint with barely enough waiting space and a bar table.  Obviously, there are outdoor seating.  What is not obvious is that there are indoor seating on the second floor.  The second floor dining area is basic, clean, has a wash room and a TV.    The services was very friendly.  We sat in the 2nd floor after placing the orders.  One of the counter staffs brought the food and drinks up when it was ready.  I didn't expect this level of services, and more unexpectedly, they didn't expect any tip.  Last but not least, free WIFI.  Just ask for password."}
{"text":"I liked the food here.  I got the 1/2 chicken combo and it hit the spot.  The rotisserie flavour on the surface was pretty darn good but the thicker pieces of chicken could have been a bit more tender.    The sauce they give you is yummmmy.  The Yuka fries were a little on the oily side.. I think because they're thick and soft on the inside they seemed to hold more oil.  They were were hard for me to down after eating all that chicken.  I took the left over Yuka fries home.  I reheated them the next day and they tasted a lot better when I wasn't stuffed.    The Peruvian salad was pretty watered down, won't get that again.    The Peruvian-imported soda tasted good.  As for the service, the staff was reeeally nice.  There were quite a few people with us and boy did we make a mess (plus my cuzn spilled water on the floor :P) but the gentlemen who served us was sooo polite.  He cleaned it up quickly and was still very respectful and talkative.  And after, because we were celebrating a birthday and had our own cake, he brought extra plates up for us.  Overall, I would recommend this place to others.  Nando's is another Portuguese-style chicken place but IMO their quality of service is questionable... plus they're not even Portuguese!   This place is also halal.. kudos to the owner for doing that :)"}
{"text":"I am updating this review because the owner apologized for the bad service and even gave me a family meal on the house because of what happened which was a pleasant surprise.  It's rare that places of business will take the blame for bad service.  Usually when I give low ratings they snap at me saying I'm being Too harsh so I'm glad that los chicos was able to go above and beyond for this.  I really do love the food here especially their yuca fries.  They are so addictive!!!!' Thank you again los chicos.  I will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"After their move, the food still tastes the same and it looks like they added a few new items (see appetizers) on the dine-in menu. However, prices have gone up 60%. The quarter chicken with a side which used to cost 8.50 now costs 13.50. Compared to Swiss Chalet 13.59 gets you a half chicken dinner. Everything on the menu has gone up so much. In fact, since they havent updated the prices on their website you can still see the old prices there. Also, if you dine in, service moves at snails pace - took 40 minutes to get what we ordered. Everything on this menu is so damn expensive. I won't be coming back since the value for money is just not there anymore for me. You can get great food for half the price. If you choose to come here, I recommend getting the take out option."}
{"text":"The chicken here is OUTSTANDING! Absolutely delicious. I came across this place because they're really the only place around me that make GOOD chicken. The Nandos down the road is a f*king joke.   The chicken is always on par here. I've visited and taken out several times and it has always been consistent. The staff are extremely friendly and treat you with respect. Very hard to find these days.   The potatoes are also pretty delicious. I enjoy this place almost 3 times a month and they have yet to disappoint in any way.   4/5 for me."}
