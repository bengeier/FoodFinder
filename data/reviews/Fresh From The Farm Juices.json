{"text":"Delicious healthy food and yummy juices and smoothies. Everyone is so friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I went for a postworkout smoothie and was very disappointed. They were out of whey protein.... So went with the banana/pb smoothie with some vegan(??) protein. It lacked flavor, the smoothie was half full of ice CUBES(like they poured the smoothie over ice like it was a soda) and it was 9 bucks for 12oz. Will not be going back. This is not a smoothie bar."}
{"text":"Visiting town and found this gem on yelp while looking for something healthy and delicious. If you enjoy fresh local vegetables in food or drink form, this is the place for you.  The orange juice and the spicy lemonade are killer. The wraps are over the top. Delicious sprouts too.  The humans inside are some very friendly souls.  You might be best off just buying one of everything and calling it a day."}
{"text":"I don't think they want to server customers here. When I asked for the juice I want and it wasn't in the fridge he seemed like it was a chore to make it, after he made it he brought me two warm bottles of blended almond milk. First of being a cold pressery I would expect it to be press, or at least cold.  When I asked for ice they couldn't supply any so he told me to put it in the fridge for a bit. Being in a rush I just asked for a refund again very reluctant to do this. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I wish the owner would read the comments because I have been a regular customer for the past few years and I have found several things to be true. One thing that is consistent is INCONSISTENCY! with this place. Portion sizes are always different, the pace of the service is sometimes unbearably sluggish and the food/ juice availability is lacking  Maybe it's time to say goodbye."}
{"text":"My  husband and I were in the area and we are so glad we found this place. The chicken wrap we had was very good. Their cold pressed juices were delicious. If you are into eating clean definitely try this place."}
{"text":"The best place to get Organic Juices. They are awesome. When ever I visit Friends in Pittsburgh. I always stop by and stack up on the juices. I haven't been able to find anything like this in New York. Only if they could ship to my place in New York it would be awesome. Either way if your in town a must goto place if you like vegan & organic juices. The owner is a wonderful guy."}
{"text":"I love these juices!  I was so happy that I was back working in Pittsburgh just so I could have my daily juice addiction taken care of.  It's hard actually when I'm not here.... you all don't know how lucky you are to have such amazing juices available!  I live in Seattle... we don't have anything close!  Favorites are Limey Green and Ruby Red.  They don't like me very much at Espresso a Mano when they run out.. I get a tad cranky!  Hehe.    So yummy, healthy!  I drink 1-2 every day!"}
{"text":"I wish more people around here knew about this place! I stop in for lunch every now and then and I've never had a bad experience; the chicken curry wrap is addicting! The owner is a very nice guy and is quite knowledgeable about his products. I'm far from a health food nut but I would reccomend this place to anyone who loves fresh and organic vegetables and juices. Try the spicy lemonade!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Instagram while searching for a different juice place and I'm so glad I did! I love cold pressed juice but for some reason there aren't many good ones around Pittsburgh. This place is authentic and amazing! As soon as I said it was my first visit, Ankit jumped on the opportunity to give me samples of juice. While he was discussing their process and each juice, I could instantly tell he was passionate about it. I think I sampled around 6 different kinds and they were all delicious. I decided on the healer, restless red and carrot, apple, ginger today. I will be starting a new job within walking distance next week and I'm so excited. I have a feeling I will be a frequent customer."}
{"text":"Delicious Food and juices.  I can't wait to come back with my whole family!  I had the Ateam smoothie, awesome! And a wrap that satisfied my appetite without weighing me down.  Everything was so good I brought back a few juices for her family."}
{"text":"I could not give it a five star rating because of the inconsistency in the preparation of the smoothies.  Sometimes you get one made perfect, other times not so good!   The juice is always perfect.  Just wish they would have some kind of consistency for the smoothies!!"}
{"text":"This is a very wholesome and well-needed raw establishment in the south hills of Pittsburgh. The food is natural and delectable. The juices are beyond exceptional. The employees are nice. Additionally, if you are planning on doing a juice cleanse, this would be the place to do it."}
{"text":"3FJ is the healthiest and tastiest restaurant in Pennsylvania!! It is in my top 10 for the entire United States. Do yourself a favor and eat here.  Recommendation: My favorite is the vegan tuna with the noodle mix, cauliflower & peas, kale, celery and green squash in a wrap with a side of fruit and mini side-salad and a juice. They always add cayenne pepper for me as well, because I love the spice.  Thank you Ankit and thanks to all of your staff! I love you all and love the food!"}
{"text":"Awesome, healthy menu items. Unbelievably fresh juices. Their passion for what their business stands for is clear when you walk through the door. Not only do they have great juice, but their menu is extensive and there seems to be options for everyone."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Has gluten free options and dairy free too. Organic or better than organic and non-Gmo. They buy locally so sometimes ingredients may not be available but they were able to improvise for what I wanted. I'd rather that any day than buying from some huge company...  I had an egg wrap with veggies. Pretty amazing. Gluten free too. And dairy free. We tried Move my feet, very good. Spicy and delicious. Not sweet. Shake my banana, delicious, not too sweet.   Juices, cleanses, ginger shots etc. If I didn't live in California, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"If you're tired of trying to make your own fresh juices then this is the place to go. They make  awesome fresh juices from organic vegetables and fruits. While you're there you can get a salad and various wraps .I especially enjoy the curry wrap and juice combo.I like to make my own fresh juices but it's a lot of work shopping cleaning and juicing and not to mention the costly equipment. I'm getting tired just writing about it. This company uses the press method of juicing which is considered one of the best. I'm going to enjoy my  wrap and juice and I hope this was helpful to you."}
{"text":"I'm a college athlete and a Personal trainer. I love the foods and juices. I don't really believe in cleanses but eating healthy and organic is what this place delivers. Everything is fresh and the owner is so incredibly nice. Answers every question I have about every juice. Always come back as much as I can."}
{"text":"Love this place! I am so excited to have a healthy, fresh, organic juice bar when I'm visiting home. This is so needed in the area! The owner was so incredibly friendly and helpful. I will definitely be stopping in every time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"stopped here this morning to see what it was all about. it was even better than I had thought!  - I sampled some of the cold pressed juices. I liked \"Black and Yellow\" and \"Spicy Lemonade\" wasn't bad either. This is coming from someone who gags at the smell of V8. - I ordered the \"A-Team\" smoothie - I ordered the Kale Noodle Salad with lots of extra veggies (it's basically all build your own). wasn't bad, the sesame-ginger dressing was a bit overwhelmingly spicy, but it was very fresh.  - great vibes all around, I believe I spoke to the owner who was very friendly - they have \"vegan pizza fridays\"  - a smoothie, fruit cup, and salad (which I only ate half of, there's basically two servings) was about $13"}
{"text":"This is not only good for You.... I would say it is  Better for you opposed to going to the doctor!! and absolutely scrumptiously savory !!!!! This is better then attempting \"good for u food at home\"..... By a mile!!! U can order the juices by the case and they ship ,.... This is part of my new lean and mean workout cut to cut last inches before my photo shoots.... So happy we found it! The owner is so full of passion and it shows in every drink And dish !... This is the new menchies and chipotle restaurant ... America will have a better health level when they get National"}
{"text":"Nice little place on 19 in Canonsburg to get delicious cold pressed juices. Healthy breakfast and lunch options as well like salad, smoothies and wraps. The juice is really good and prices pretty average I think. Options to purchase juice cleanse packages and gift cards. Black and Yellow is my favorite juice so far. This is one of two locations with the other in the North Hills. The staff seemed friendly but it seemed a little disorganized when we were there. I am looking forward to come back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for my breakfast juices for the next week or so and of course had to take home a chicken Waldorf wrap for lunch. Can't get enough of that stuff!! \"Shake my banana\" smoothie with a shot of chocolate protein is the bomb as well! Never had a bad meal/experience since I started swinging in over a year ago. Friendly, knowledgeable owner/staff are eager to help with any and all questions. Even helped me through my first 2-2day cleanses. Highly recommended for all of the above. Keep it fresh!  \"Let thy food be thy medicine\""}
{"text":"This place is JUICE HEAVEN!! I'm visiting relatives and am lucky this is located right down the street from them. Juice is an part of my everyday life and sometimes when I'm traveling, I have to skip a few days. We fly out tonight, but I bought four different juices to sip on all day to keep my immune system strong. Plane germs stay away! The store is beautiful with the greens growing right in the back! They couldn't be any fresher  great selection and ingredients you don't see at other juice bars- turmeric, cilantro and dandelion greens.  I'm impressed. Highly highly recommend! I wish there was a Farm Fresh Juices in my neighborhood in California, but they do ship their juices, so I'll definitely be ordering them online.  Try the green delight. It's yummy and will wake you right up!"}
{"text":"Owner very compassionate and warm. Knowledgeable guy who admitted he trained 6 months at the Gerson Institute.  Good enough for me!  Gerson is amazing.  But i digress....pb banana shake is tasty.  Also did the 3 day cleanse. Expensive ($120?) but totally worth it when you factor in that everything is organic and freshly squeezed.  After doing this cleanse i had soooooo many gall stones and liver stones come out!!! Will be doing this every couple months until my own juicer comes in.  But even then I'll come here. Great place.  Pay money for a gift card then get 10-20% off each purchase.  Win win for both establishment and customer! Smart move!"}
{"text":"I am so happy there is a place like this in the area. The juices and smoothies are amazing! They are made fresh in-house. All of their food is organic and guilt-free! The owner and staff are all very friendly. I recommend this to anyone looking for a healthy option :)"}
{"text":"Açaí bowl was good, but tasted icy and watered down. I do like that they let you select and put unlimited toppings on it. It's also cheaper than some other açaí bowls in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Ordered $160 dollars forth of juices to be delivered for an 8am company meeting. The meeting was a fun, inspiring brainstorm with a silly theme  to \"get juiced up!\". So the juices were obviously an integral part of the event. I had spoken to the manager multiple times on the phone to get a quote, accept the quote, coordinate the delivery and pay the invoice ahead of time. The morning of the juices were scheduled to arrive at 730am. No delivery or contact was made, so I started calling at 7:50 and didn't get anyone at the store to answer the phone. After 3 calls the manager calls me back at 8 saying the driver is on his way and he will have him call me. Too late as my meeting started at 8. The driver calls me at 820, saying that he is 20 mins away. The shop is only a total of 20 minutes from my office. This means they didn't leave until 820 to deliver juices that were set for 730. I had to leave the meeting at 840 to get the juices at the front desk. The security man said that the delivery man literally ran away so that he didn't have to talk to me. Extremely disappointing experience. They did not attempt to contact me to apologize. Have never been treated so poorly by a business."}
{"text":"Great tasting juices and fresh salads.  Service was friendly, but could improve on logistics.  When you enter the restaurant, you go to the bar, order your food, the person that is making your food then takes it to a table, and then you leave your plate at the table and pay after.  Kind of strange.  In my opinion, you should order at the cash register, pay right then and there, then pick your food up after (similar to a Panera style of ordering).  Just a minor detail in the grand scheme of things, but I think it would make for a smoother process."}
{"text":"Wow! I can not say enough good things about this business and their employees. Everyone I have spoken with has been such a pleasure and very informative. The juices are out of this world delicious and I am SO HAPPY that I found this place and can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"This little hidden gem is a great place for a very fresh meal. I had the curry chicken wrap with lots of fresh veggies and the \"Pink Lady\" juice that was quite delicious. The employees were very friendly and explained the juice cleanse process to my friend who purchased a 6 day plan. The place is also extremely clean and inviting! My only quibble is the fact that they don't have public wifi, and we came here specifically that night to plan some things with a computer. Perhaps the owner will consider this in the future."}
{"text":"I had heard of this place from a friend this week and decided to give it a try. I got Black and Yellow, Restless Red, The Works and a new one they had called Melon Berry. I would highly recommend any of these...they were delicious! I have had similar drinks from the store, i.e. Bolthouse Farms Green Goodness, and these juices far surpass those store bought drinks. Each juice is so smooth, which is a nice change of p. ace from the all natural drinks I've had. A lot of other juices I've tried have not been blended down as much and are a little thicker than I enjoy. Unfortunately this kind of quality does come at a price. If you are on a budget, you may want to steer clear. It was almost $6 for a 12 oz. bottle. Worth the money? Absolutely. But there are a plethora of similar options out there that could give you much better bang for your buck."}
