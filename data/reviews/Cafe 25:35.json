{"text":"I won't give 5 stars based on one food-less visit, but so far I love this place. Nice, warm caf√© atmosphere (while still maintaining some local old west Buckeye authenticity), good coffee, really friendly people. Judging by the delicious food smells, I may have to add a star when I come back for lunch one day.

UPDATE!  Since I wrote this review I tried the food. Trust me on this: if you have an addictive personality, do not even TRY those cinnamon rolls. They are beyond delicious. The sandwiches are really good as well. I added the final star. Since I wrote the review I also moved out of Buckeye, and I'm still jonesing for one of those cinnamon rolls...."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here.  I had the Buckeye Boy breakfast plate.  Everything was fine, the potatoes were highly spiced.  I love highly spiced food.  
Cashier was very nice, atmosphere was calm, (no loud music). 
Stop in here, I think you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the neighborhood when I spotted Cafe 25:35... Really glad that I did! Ordered three hot sandwiches to go for lunch: The Southwest Chicken, the Pork Loin and the Ultimate Grilled Cheese. All three were FANTASTIC! Even after making the 20 min drive home with them, they were still ridiculously delicious. I was impressed with the cafe's staff as everyone was very friendly even though the place was packed and they were busy. Only downside... Their cinnamon rolls were sold out by the time I got there! Will definitely be back with my family!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Very cool industrial interior. Amazing food! Friendly service. Worth the drive south from the 10."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Buckeye. Love their fries as well. It's difficult to get a table in the cafe so plan on doing a carry out order."}
{"text":"I have found my new \"go to\" place in Buckeye! I had a delicious croissant breakfast sandwich. The croissant was light, flaky and buttery. My cappacino was delicious as well. I want to come back and try lots of their items."}
{"text":"I have been to this place 3 times so far, ate 3 different meals and was never disappointed. Meals have a creative twist and are excellent, and everything I had was full of flavor and definitely not blah, like another reviewer suggested. 
They have many sauces you can ask for on the side if you need them. 
I've had the Ultimate Grilled Cheese sandwich for lunch, and the Sam I Am and Breakfast Burrito for breakfast. I loved them all!
My favorite dessert are definitely the maple bacon sticky buns. What an awesome idea! If you haven't tried them, you need to!
The service is great and staff goes out of their way to make sure you have everything you need. 
I am so thankful for a non-chain, high quality family restaurant in Buckeye. Keep it going!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Freshest ingredients, every bite is delicious. Got to try Palo Verde burger."}
{"text":"Really cute place, excellent food & friendly service! The buckeye boy breakfast is a massive amount of food and a really fair price. The potatoes, pancakes, breakfast burrito and coffee were all fantastic!"}
{"text":"They have a good grilled buffalo chicken sandwich. I like you you can choose if you want a side of fries or fruit instead of the house chips. They did serve me Nasty talking soggy French fries that were not even warm.however the burger is pretty nasty I'm not a fan of frozen patties."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they do not serve breakfast \"all day\"... I mean, you'd think if a place is only open till 2 pm they'd still be serving breakfast after 11am. Otherwise, the food was great!! Very fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast one time and the food was good but cold.  The atmosphere is good and friendly sometimes. It is hit or miss.  We went for lunch and it was much better!  Probably will not try breakfast but their tuna sandwich w/  fries is excellent.  Drink selection is limited so be prepared. Price is good for the portions."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch.  It was some of the most delicious food I have had in a long time!  You can tell the ingredients are crazy-fresh, and the menu choices were chef-created!  Sweet potato fries were the BEST I have ever had.

Check closing times, they close early afternoons, and I think the kitchen closes early.

We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch here about six times and it was very good  but only tried it today for breakfast. BIG mistake. Took 40 minutes to get food for two of us and I had to go back and ask for our drinks after 20 minutes. Eggs were dry tough and cold. potatoes cold. Toast cold. We paid for 8 items for a veggie omelet and it may have had 3 and little of those. The staff are friendly but Don' t say you were unhappy when asked or you'll get a lecture about how hard everyone works. Won't go again."}
{"text":"Finally!!!!   A place to eat other than the usual down here in Buckeye. I ordered the chicken cashew great flavor. I also ordered a bacon maple roll so freakin good..Definetely telling ALL about this place. Cool deco and great vibe.."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The food was so good.  I had the 25:35 turkey club..the turkey was REAL turkey, not pressed.  Everything was fresh inside!  Hubby had the cashew chicken salad sammie.  He said it was really good.. just the right amount of ingredients.  Son had the ultimate grilled cheese.  The homemade thick cut potato chips are to die for.   The restaurant was clean with an old fashioned decor.  Tables were cleared & cleaned immediately upon customers leaving to make space for the next.  And the prices were really good.  I was very surprised by the quality of the sandwiches compared to the prices paid.  This place is a GEM in the heart of old town Buckeye!  I'm really happy for the owners to have become successful so quickly.   Whatever they are doing, they are doing it right.  Employees were genuinely happy to be there which really reflects on the owners & managers."}
{"text":"I have stopped in quiet a few times for lunch and once or twice for breakfast. 
I have had nothing I would call usual or just okay. The food is terrific.  The time taken with each menu item was noted. I am picky about my biscuits and gravy and the owned assured me I would like his grandfathers recipe and he was right. The ingredients are fresh and well balanced in the omelet. Their breakfast potatoes were well cooked and tasty. For lunch the Hubby and I have covered many aspects of the menu. The burgers are well proportioned and juicy.  Pick the toppings that speak to you the most, you cannot go wrong. I have to admit a secret, I am a tomato soup junkie.  If you put it on the menu I will be returning until I finally order it. So a rainy day I head in and it is my order. That day I added a child's grilled cheese to it because I did not want to have a huge lunch. Both were terrific but get this, The tomato soup is smoked.  It is crave-able. Not only is the ingredients somehow smoked the guy tells me he cold smokes the black pepper too. Gah, I am a sucker for anything actually smoked. Don't try to fake me out with that chemical liquid smike either... it won't fly here. 
-- We will return I and I encourage you to head on over too. Order anything on the menu that states it is smoked. It is an art to smoke well and Cafe 25:35 is an artist."}
{"text":"I still love this little restaurant and I'm happy to see it still busy. The staff are so sweet and attentive - I think we had at least three staff check in to ask us if our dine-in experience was pleasant, clear plates, pick up trash, etc. The food is fresh and yummy. It has a nice homemade vibe. It's true - the cinnamon rolls are something to write home about. Happy to visit here every so often when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I discovered cafe 25/35 when I became a director at a large organization in the town of buckeye. I often bring people from out of town to 25/35 for business lunches or recommend the cafe for people to stop by on their way out of town. Additionally as a community member that attends high level community meetings, I have always spoken highly of the cafe and agreed with others of their positive comments. Many of my staff will order to go from the cafe for lunch. We were even more excited to see the option to order online so we could leave our busy clinic to run and grab the food which is fresh and tasty to enjoy for lunch. 

After my interaction and experience today (5/5), myself and my staff will no longer be ordering from this establishment and I will not be recommending it to others and will be sure to speak my disagreement to others who say otherwise. First, we were a bit disappointed to see that the online ordering is no longer an option and that the prices went up. However given that we love the food and supporting a local buckeye eatery, we planned to order anyways. We had to pay separately and order over the phone unfortunately so we called one by one and were sure to coordinate our calls to not bombard the girl, Kelly, who was taking our orders. By the time we got to our last order, Kelly was rude to this person and asked \"why are there so many questions? Can't you see the menu online?\" Then when my staff ran to get the food, she had to wait an additional 15 minutes while other people who walked in were first taken care of. Then once she indicated what order we were picking up, kelly asked her what were in each order. Isn't that Kelly's job to know what we ordered? Not only did we not get the correct order, we also did not get receipts. I paid $15 for just a burger and no side..that's not what I ordered? In addition, the chef was making unnecessary rude comments to my staff who was just picking the order up. After the food arrived back, I called and asked to speak to a manager. She put me on hold for 10 minutes, got back on the phone and told me the rest of the order was still there and we could come get it. Really? Really? This is customer service? She asked to call me back because they were busy. If I am an upset customer, customer service 101 tells you to then make that persona priority. I requested a refund, as their burgers are good, but not worth $15 with no side. And on top of that I never received a call back or a refund. Absolutely ridiculous. 

Cafe 25/35 has lost my business, my staffs business and any recommendations for their horrible customer service and Un-professionalism ."}
{"text":"WOW! Just had breakfast at the cafe, I must say it was excellent. I had the \"Sam I Am' and it was exceptional. I have also enjoyed lunch here and you MUST try the chips, they are so delish! Staff is very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"The best cup of coffee and cinnamon roll ever!  The cinnamon rolls are homemade, gooey and sweet, but still yeasty.  My husband loves the southwestern style omelette with homemade salsa and I love the french toast.  For lunch try the palo verde burger and the homemade kettle chips.  The burger is juicy without being too greasey and the chips are crunchy with a seasoning that is addicting.  This is real cooked to order food, not microwaved, it isn't instant but it is quick and the staff is always very friendly!"}
{"text":"It's not table service, Wich I prefer :)
 I like the gal at the register, she's adorable and cheery :)
If u want calm,no fuss. ..this is the place for you"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where I heard about this place but I'm glad I did. We went there this morning for breakfast and it was absolutely delicious. The cinnamon rolls were out of this world. The pancakes were the best I've ever had. They were the moist kind, kind of like a crape. The decor was really nice too, it was sort of urban rustic. But the best thing of all was the people in the building very friendly and service was awesome. I loved the fact that they named this restaurant after a Bible verse. I am happy to support them. I would highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"I happened to stop by while waiting for the print shop next door to open. I had a very nice cheese omelet with potatoes and an ice tea. Food was great, the gentleman cashier was very friendly and welcoming. I'd love to stop back again sometime and try one of their sandwiches. Nice decor, I felt perfectly comfortable dining alone there."}
{"text":"This cafe is truly one of the best places to eat not only in Buckeye but in the entire West Valley. The pancakes are amazing along with the cinnamon rolls, and there is a great selection of omelets. If you are looking for lunch their hamburgers are absolutely amazing! And their selection of sandwiches are wonderful- dont let another day pass without eating at Cafe 25:35!"}
{"text":"In Buckeye for work. Stopped here for lunch based on all the positive reviews.  25:35 Cafe was well deserving of 5 stars!  Was greeted with a welcome right when I stepped in the door.  Extremely friendly staff.  And to top off the good experience, the food was delicious! 

I ordered the Philly Steak sandwich with a side of French fries.  The sandwich was a little small, but it was the perfect amount to fill me up, without putting me into a food coma.  The fries were very good.  I want to go back and try the sweet potato fries.  I finished the meal with a chocolate cupcake.... Which did end up putting me into a food coma, but well worth it. :)

All in all, I would highly recommend stopping and eating at this cafe, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"the three of us had lunch, good is thumbs up - burger's were served as ordered - bacon crisp was so, bacon med was just the right limpness, the house chips were good.  The hostess/wait staff was excellent, clean restoom and dining room - I will be visiting again when out buckeye direction."}
{"text":"I just moved to Buckeye and I saw the good ratings so I decided to check it out. This place is great, everything is homemade their Ranch, honey mustard, buns etc.  They are open from 6 a.m. till 2 p.m. if you are hungry between those hours I recommend coming here nice homemade cooking and cool atmosphere"}
{"text":"The workers seem nice enough.
I tried what I thought was a cinnamon roll, but I got home an ate it and it had bacon on it. This may be trendy idea to put bacon on a cinnamon roll, but I thought it is was horrible. I have had others tell me good things about this place, but I spent almost $20 on 5 cinnamon rolls that no one liked, so I doubt, if I will ever go back.
I do  like the name of the place. It is nice to see a business with a Christian meaning behind the name."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential, because the food is actually pretty good! They had tartar sauce with the fish and chips (no one has tartar sauce down here.) sandwich looked good.

But we've been here twice, and both times, the service is just dreadful. A barista and 1 server trying to manage the entire cafe, server got confused with a phone call and not only didn't remember which soda was which, and handled it awkwardly, but also messed up an order and didn't hear half of it. So we've been here about 25 minutes longer than we should have.

Please needs to learn how to get out of its own way. Get someone in here that knows how to drive a restaurant, and have more than 1 server for goodness sake. And make sure those people aren't just a bunch of 19 year old girls with no capability to handle 12 tables."}
{"text":"Worth the stop between Spring Training and back home. Food was great, as was the service."}
{"text":"We stopped by based on the good reviews and boy were they right. The food was great!!! Make sure you try the sweet potato fries. The service was excellent. We were greeted as soon as we came in the door. The ladies explained the menu choices and were very helpful in making a selection. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My sisters and I really enjoyed our breakfast here. The staff was so friendly and the food was exceptional. Their burritos are HUGE and their home fries are so tasty. The owner's baby was even hanging out which was such a warm and personal touch. Definitely a great option if you're in Buckeye!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Super friendly.  Clean. Best breakfast stop decision for our road trip!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast! The atmosphere is great and the attention to detail is amazing. They won't serve you food unless it looks exactly how they intended it to look. They only thing I'd like is for them to me open later. But over all service is really good and it feels right when you're there. A+++"}
{"text":"Incredible. Clean, friendly, great food. Great find while driving to Phoenix!! Worth the four miles off highway 10. Definitely will visit again!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on Wednesday.  Breakfast sandwich was great, staff friendly and efficient.  Cute place & town. Didn't care for the potatoes.  Don't know why they weren't great, just a little tough and dry and not a lot of flavor in spite of the onions & peppers.  Got the feeling they weren't cooked together. Just a upgrade suggestion."}
{"text":"An interesting experience. Is it worth the wait? Read on and see.

I had read reviews before trying so I knew the service was going to be slow. I brought my patience with me however when you're with a 4 year old there comes a point when waiting is just too long.

Our experience starts when we walk in and are promptly greeted. We are shown a table and given 3 menus however there is a sign that says Order Here above a cash register.

The menu is very interesting sounding. Plenty of great flavor combinations to cover every palette. My friend orders first and gets a kids grilled cheese with a fruit cup for the 4 year old and a chicken salad sandwich on toasted wheat bread. She is given number 15. She returns to the table and someone was in front of me before ordering...no big deal.

Comes time for me to place my order. I offer to buy another friend lunch and ask her to place her order. She orders a Reuben with sweet potato fries. I order Tony's garlic burger and fries and we choose to split a garden salad. We asked to have the salad dressing on the side. Now we learn they are out of romaine lettuce. No big deal as spring mix is just fine. We do however want to have blue cheese dressing and balsamic dressing.  This now becomes a \"special create your own salad\" the irony here is it's cheaper than the garden salad we intended to order. We are given #17.

We wait 45 minutes. Friend with 4 year old gets up to check on our order since its been so long and 3 people who ordered after us had already been served, finished their meals and are ready to leave. Shortly after a cashier comes out to tell my friend who ordered the Reuben that they are out of sauerkraut and is this okay. The response is no as the kraut makes the Reuben. The salad is then delivered to the table and comes with a side of blue cheese (not dressing) turns out they don't have blue cheese dressing. They have balsamic, poppyseed or ranch!

My burger is now delivered and I feel horribly guilty because the grilled cheese for the 4 year old was still missing and then after about 3 minutes the grilled cheese arrives along with the chicken salad sandwich. Both of these items looked incredible. I've never seen such a beautiful (and large) fruit bowl for a kids side (and he ate the whole sandwich and bowl of fruit) even though it was nearly an hour before our food actually arrived, the quality of the food was really great. My burger although ordered medium rare was more well done but it was still juicy and the bun was an egg bun and light as could be. The flavor of the garlic, grilled onions and provolone cheese made this burger just the way it was (no need for salt, ketchup or mustard) the fries were done nicely however they could of used more seasoning. Lucky for me, they had a shaker of seasoning salt on the table which perked them right up.

Honestly, I'd go back, order, walk the town and then come in and grab a table. I'm sure there will still be time before the meal is ready but the food is just that good. Oh and it's really reasonably priced. Average $8.50 for a sandwich/burger and $5-7 for a salad plus $2 more to add chicken.  They have really good blackberry iced tea too!

This would have been 5 star if service was just a bit faster. Yes, I'm going back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a small one in the small town of Buckeye, Arizona. Our GPS took us right to it. The staff is small in numbers (sticking to the small theme), but efficient. The menu is mostly soups, salads and  sandwiches, including some outstanding burgers. Average pricing on the salads and sandwiches is probably around &10, but the portions are LARGE. the burgers are so good, you should just ask for a to go box right at the start. Keep in mind that the focus the restaurant is \"hometown \" (except fo those burgers).  The ambiance was just what we wanted in a great town like Buckeye!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've only had their breakfast options and they are delicious. Friendly and fast service, very cozy place. Food is always great! I recommend this place to all my family and friends."}
{"text":"Food was terrific and the portions were huge. My wife and I both had the Buckeye Boy and couldn't finish it.

The only downside was the service. The waitresses were not very attentive and we had to ask for everything...coffee refills, silverware, creamer for the coffee, etc.

Very small place. Well definitely try it again."}
{"text":"So I'd been eying this place for a while ( I'm such a sucker for local eateries) my family typically goes out for breakfast on Sundays and since that is the day they are closed, we kept missing it. Well it just so happens that we decided to have breakfast out on a Saturday morning so of course the Only logical thing to do was to eat here! We were greeted upon entering the door and walked up to order our food. We advised the very nice girl at the cash box that we'd never been  in so weren't sure how it worked. She was super nice and explained every thing to us, they do not have a child's menu but that's ok they will allow you to \" build\" one based on what your munchkin might want. I got my daughter a croissant Sammy, my husband had the Arkansas burrito, and myself the good old breakfast burrito. When the food came I was very impressed by the presentation. We all really liked our food. I do wish either the chorizo or the homemade salsa had just a little more kick to it but I'm just crazy like that. Overall a very good experience with great food and service. We will be back."}
{"text":"I can't decide between 3 or 4 stars but since my husband says it's a solid 4, I'll bump it!  I had the beef and mushroom sandwich and it was AWESOME.  My husband loved his rainbow burger.  The chips were good, too.  

Nice d√©cor.  A little hipster but I like to think of myself as hip.

Pretty good service.  Our 8 meals came out kind of staggered so we all ate at different times but it's all good.

So why was I deciding between 3 and 4 stars?  The fries.  It's the flavored kind, which is fine but my one of my barometers for a good restaurant is how their fried food tastes and the fries here tasted like they're waiting too long to change out the oil in the fryer.  Plus they didn't have a veggie patty which sucked b'c I love veggie patties.

I definitely think it's worth giving a shot.  We should support our local businesses and this place delivers!"}
{"text":"Very nice little cafe in Buckeye Arizona. Being surrounded by every fast food joint u can imagine what a relief it is to find a REAL restaurant.. I had the fish fry which was made exactly how I like it and the tartar sauce was out of this world. The wife had the tuna sandwich and it was actually made with white tuna, not that mayonnaise filled crap u get at the Sub shops"}
{"text":"Ok, so I was a but surprised when I figured out that the name is from a New Testament passage (Matthew 25:35), but in the-middle-of-nowhere Arizona, a good place to eat is a good place to eat. Well... it isn't the best place: there aren't many meatfree options, lots and lots of burgers or meat sandwiches, I chose from one of the few meatfree salads they had (which the cashier then tried to convince me needed chicken). The balsamic Greek salad had lots of really wilted, old lettuce, only a few kalamata olives, and really bland artichoke hearts. 
Other than that... the cafe itself is pretty cute, the fans are on a clever pulley system, and the staff is friendly. My guess is that they make better burgers than salads, and if you're stuck far away from Phoenix or Chandler, this is a pretty good bet."}
{"text":"The absolutely best place in Old Town Buckeye. Super friendly service, wonderful atmosphere, & great prices. The only bad part is it's not open for dinner :-("}
{"text":"I read the reviews and we decided to try it this past Saturday for breakfast.  We walked up to the counter, ordered and found a seat.  The young lady behind the counter was very friendly however they do not have Diet Coke.  I dont drink coffee and was bummed out when they told me \"no Diet Coke\".   

The food came and the portions are big.  The presentation was good but the food itself is just okay.  It isnt anything special and I wouldnt go out of my way to make a special trip just to eat there. It lacked flavor.  Kinda Blah!   

I think we will try it one more time to see if its any better.  Our meal with drinks cost $21.00, so it wasnt a bad deal just need to add some flavor."}
{"text":"This is a cute place in Buckeye. It is quite spendy but it is cleann the employees are friendly and the food is good. If you feel like spending $9 on a salad, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos, French toast, and breakfast platter.  Tried the online ordering but it wasn't ready so they complied our drinks. Clean, friendly, great food. A little drive off the freeway but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Another great breakfast. This place is truly a diamond in the rough.

I alway get the Sam I Am, the pesto and arugula make this breakfast sandwich taste super fresh. I tried my husband's pancakes this time and they were  amazing. 

We've never had a bad experience here. The staff is friendly and the inside of the restaurant is so cute. We drive from Surprise and it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Great spot! Incredible service and delicious food. Anytime I'm in Buckeye I'm going to make it a point to stop in :)"}
{"text":"Thanks yelp for helping me to find great breakfast place during my trip! Coffee and omelette are awesome!"}
{"text":"One of my fave place to stop for coffee! I work in the Buckeye area and when I need a caffeine this is where I go. I like the Texas caramel mocha, it's bold and strong. When I drink the iced coffee, keeps me wired all day! 
The restaurant food is good. The customer service is hit-and-miss. Overall, it is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise to find this little gem in downtown buckeye. Great soup and sandwiches here without having to drive far out!"}
{"text":"Being new to Buckeye there aren't many familiar choices when dining out.  Being a breakfast lover I decided to try this place out.

I liked it.  Everything tasted great and everyone was friendly.  Prices were great for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Best fish fry I've had in years on Friday evening. I hope the decide to stay open later every day of the week."}
{"text":"Unbelievable ... one of the best breakfasts I have ever had .... and I have been to some pretty fancy places for breakfast.  You can tell everything is made with love and passion.  I had the green chili chorizo omelet and shared a cinnamon roll ... just heavenly!  Plus, the staff is amazing!  If you are ever driving through Buckeye, this is a must stop!"}
{"text":"Omg, everything on the menu looks good!  I had the country Benedict, and enjoyed every drop.  The home fries are the best I've had.  We had a big party and the staff was very accommodating and friendly.  Everyone loved their food no matter what they ordered.  Will definitely go again to try something new next time.  Lots of food, so don't be afraid to share if you have a smaller appetite.  Biscuits are the best I've had this side of Louisiana.  Five big stars!"}
{"text":"Went there today hubby had white tanks burger and I had Tony's garlic burger! Both were very good, have to say the reviews are right! Ladies beside us had chicken salads that looked really good( I will go back to try one)! The restaurant is very small, not a lot of seating! I had fries which are extra, had to much salt (I can't eat a lot of salt) but they were very good! Asked me if I wanted ranch or ketchup for fries or both! I like having a choice because I like Ranch on fries! I'm sure it gets busy for breakfast but will try and get in once we hear it's good too! Oh forgot to say our first time here!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today.  Our first time ever here.  The service was extremely friendly.  Cramped dinning area, but that could be because it was busy.  The 3 amigos chicken sandwich was awesome.  The Andy club my wife got was good.  The fries were yummy.   There is not any diet soda on the drink fountain.  That just seemed odd. 

The serve the food on actual glass plates, but gave us styrofoam cups for our drinks.  It took a little bit before we got our food, but they were apologetic.  

We would come back again.  Interested in trying their breakfast."}
{"text":"Classic, gourmet food in the heart of downtown. Simply exceptional, from feel good food to welcoming staff, this place is unique and one of the reasons I miss living in Buckeye. I just wish it was open later....because it so good."}
{"text":"Our first experience with cafe 25:35 was wonderful. I was confused by the set up at first and not only ordered my food but got condiments and silver wear myself. Lol 
The staff was warm and inviting and the food was fantastic. I had the Philly cheesesteak omelette while my husband chose biscuits and gravy. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I liked it.  I don't feel the need to go back, though.  The staff was pleasant, but not helpful and spent a lot of time on their cell phones chatting with one another.  Their children's menu is a little high-brow for the typical kid."}
{"text":"Great find! Food was great as well as the atmosphere. The BLT was delicious, as well as the BBQ chicken sandwich. Will be back if in Buckeye again!"}
{"text":"Came by this morning to try their coffee and their amazing delicious pastries I remember from when they first opened a few years back. Sadly they only had a couple of options. I had a large toffee/caramel latte which was perfect. Just the right temperature and the staff is always friendly. My blueberry muffin tastes like it had been made a few days ago. Had a weird after taste like when you leave soy milk out all day. Only ate the top part. It was very cold and mushy. That sounds mean, specially since I truly love this place. We are avid happy customers. So I'm hoping it was just this one time thing. They always deserve four stars. I wouldn't give them less just because of one muffin. However, just wanted to let them know. REMINDER....we love this local place. Try all their yummy items."}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped in for lunch and are so happy we did! We shared a Palo Verde burger and ultimate grilled cheese sandwich. Both were amazing! Fresh and unique flavones, and the cafe chips are great!! Clean and nice cafe with very friendly staff.  We will be returning!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place with atmosphere, history and excellent food.  We met a fellow Montana friend there for lunch and spent over two hours at our table.  Any staff who visited with us enjoyed hearing why we were there and gave us very good service.  Check our the Cafe's website to learn great history of the Cafe's evolution.  Although we don't live in the area, if we did, we'd surely return for a meal..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for my 3rd visit looking for a good burger. 
I ordered the Palo Verde burger with fries instead of chips. (They're all homemade). 
First the Frys, they are not your standard French fry. They are a thick cut curly fry. They are seasoned wonderfully and are delicious. 
Moving on to the burger,  I ordered a double thinking it wouldn't be big enough for me. When I got this massive burger that was topped with green chiles and fried crispy onions, I couldn't get my mouth around it. It was huge. 
I removed the second patty and went to work on it.  
I have to say, and I'm a big guy that LOVES burgers, that this is one of the best, if no the best, burger I have ever had. 
My lunch was so good, I will be thinking about it until my next visit. 
Their hours are tough, opened from 6am - 2pm Monday thru Saturday, but was so delicious, I will work my schedule around their hours."}
{"text":"This was our first time in. I can't believe we haven't been here sooner. The BLT salad was off the hook!! 
The hub unit had a garlic burger that was scrumptious!!  
The owners go out of their way to make you feel like part of the family. 
And a coffee bar as well. OmGosh the Nutella latte. --Starbucks ain't got nothing on this."}
{"text":"Good food for a somewhat fair price, we try to go here as much as we can to support another local business."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I don't like the religious references in the name or in the decor. I am not a religious person. I am not keen on being surrounded by Bible quotes when I'm eating lunch. The hipster decor belies the religious backstory, and perhaps that's intentional. I will probably not visit again for this reason. That is my personal choice based upon my beliefs, just as it is the owner's personal choice and right to establish a business based upon his or her religious beliefs. After the recent Hobby Lobby decision by the Supreme Court, I will not frequent any businesses that are owned by religious interests."}
{"text":"Really yummy food, fun environment, coffee is great, good customer service. I will come again! The food took a long time to get to our table, so maybe not a great place if you go if you are in a hurry. (That said, I've only been there once so might not be typical.)"}
{"text":"The Arlington burger is so flavorful and the honey mustard is the best! Friendly service and lovely family friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This establishment is a gem in the city of Buckeye. Overall has great breakfast and lunch selections. Also this establishment closes early and closed on Sundays. Has a nice little area so if you have friends along you can sit on the side away from everyone eating."}
{"text":"This is gourmet food. Made fresh with the best ingredients. Love their coffee and they have the best cupcakes I have ever had hands down! The strawberry one is my favorite."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service showed up 15 minutes before closing and were denied service. This Restaurant should understand that it's standard to serve right up to the time you close, bad business to turn paying customers away (especially for a mom and pop in a small conservative income town) because you want to leave earlier. Every successful restaurant will tell you that you serve customers until close and that there is a huge difference between closing time and quitting time."}
{"text":"All very good food. You can taste the freshness and you can tell what's homemade. The service was great and the food came out fast. You should check this out for great fresh food and fantastic service."}
{"text":"Cafe 25:35 is something I would of totally not expected in Buckeye. The setting inside is just so adorable. I love the way the food is served when you get chips or fries. They're mocha's taste almost exactly like Dutch Bro Coffee, which is my favorite but can't enjoy it all the time due to their locations. Something that  I also really like is how instead of using lettuce in many of their dishes they'll use sprouts."}
{"text":"Loved this little place!  Friendly staff, great menu, excellent food, and free lemons and oranges from the chef's trees!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning, and it was delicious! I ordered the JPQ Bowl (or something like that). It was an interesting mix of food items, but definitely worked. My wife had the breakfast burrito and it was huge! She said it was really good too. The salsa that came with it was tasty. Service was quick and courteous. I don't know about their lunch, but I highly recommend this place for breakfast. Just get there early because they stop serving breakfast at 10."}
{"text":"I found this little gem in Old Town Buckeye. I had a Downtown burger which was very good. All the essentials were there, great flavor and cooked to perfection. I love the antique feeling inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"I guess it's true, no good food anywhere in Buckeye. I had high hopes that this would be different. A club sandwich should be just that, three pieces of bread, turkey, ham, bacon etc... but no, this is just a turkey sandwich. No ham and no flavor at all, plus they put sprouts on it and apparently didn't make sure they weren't full of water because it's soggy. The Cheeseburger I ordered for my boyfriend I specifically ordered it to have mayo, mustard and ketchup. She asked me about it twice and I said, yes, I don't like ordering a burger out only to pick it up and find out that they have left it dry with nothing on it. So, I get that home and there is no lettuce, onion, pickle or tomato????  

Then they wanted me to pay extra for french fries?? I think the price I paid was enough, especially since it wasn't good. Not going to be going there again."}
{"text":"This place is a new favorite for me and my family!! The garlic burger is incredible! The chips are homemade bites of heaven. The sweet potato fries are perfect! Definitely must check this place out if you like a quaint atmosphere and fantastic cuisine!!"}
{"text":"Cappuccino had no foam
Potatoes seasoned without warning seemed pre made could not eat them
Great omelette though"}
{"text":"What an adorable place! Clean and the service was great.   There is a changing table in the women's restroom for those of you who need it. Food was delicious. If I find myself in Buckeye again I will definitely stop in!!"}
{"text":"We have been living in buckeye for 3 years and I'm ashamed to say we just discovered this extraordinary cafe! Just minutes from our door step lies a hidden gem, with superb service and delicious food. The atmosphere is cozy. The staff is extra delighful. This is one of the best burgers and fries in all phoenix area. The hours are short so make sure to check if they are open. You will not be disappointed. The chef even took the time to  give us a history on the building and bricks which is amazing. Serioulsy this is a great spot for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I give only two stars not because the food is bad, but because after we gave our order, paid for our food, and sat down it still took 57 minutes to get our breakfast.   For a diner with only 10 tables or so, this is unacceptable.   Won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! Had the Palo Verde Burger that was yummy, and the best sweet potato fries I have ever had!  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Our favorite spot to hit for breakfast or burgers at lunchtime. The breakfast JPQ Bowl is amazing! Great variety of delicious burgers and sandwiches to choose from. A few of our favorites are the Garlic Burger and the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. Friendly staff that takes great care of their customers."}
{"text":"We came to buy Bison meet in Buckeye and found the Best burger we had in a while! Very nice people run the place, tasty food, and absolutely a great burger!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and find the service consistently great.  The staff is friendly and professional.  The food is delightful and the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"This place, hands-down, has the best chicken sandwich I have ever had. They have other good selections but I do love my chicken sandwich and I ALWAYS order it. The only way I try other foods is if my husband tries it first because I just can't give up my chicken sandwich. I love the intimate atmosphere, the people, and I always see the owner there, and is super polite to us and everyone who walks through that door. I've gone there quite a few times now and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Haven't tried breakfast here yet, but their coffee is amazing! Their menu looks good so I definitely need to come back to eat. I'll give them four stars until I actually eat here...which will most likely bump them to 5!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way home from Tucson today and was very pleasantly surprised!  

I ordered the Downtown Burger and my wife ordered the Whitetanks Burger!  Both of us were sold after the first bite!!  

Fresh ingredients and the burger meat was fresh, well cooked, properly seasoned, making it one of the best burgers I've had in the West Valley!!

I highly recommend Caf√® 25:35!  Started to get busy right as we were leaving around 11:30, so an early lunch would be best!

Can't wait to go back and try their breakfast menu!!"}
{"text":"I will agree with the other Yelpers, the food is pretty good here. However, the prices are absolutely outrageous! In case you have not been there and were wondering, 25:35 is a Bible scripture that goes something like, \" you were hungry, I gave you food, etc etc...\". Well I can tell you this for sure they aren't GIVING  anything away at Cafe 25:35. You are the one giving, giving a substantial portion of your paycheck to eat there. If you are going to play the Christian card, at least show some charity and knock a couple bucks off those prices. Maybe you might not make as much money, but hey, the Lord will provide, right?"}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this cafe, because I had seen it mentioned a lot of times. I had the opportunity last Friday to finally try it out. I was absolutely not impressed. 

The waitress was our first interaction. She was more about what they didn't have and wouldn't do, than about customer service or a positive experience. 

I ordered a Ciabatta breakfast sandwich. It was absolutely tasteless. I ordered it because of the bacon (I love bacon). It had no flavor at all. 

I will not try it again. There are way too many options where I can get not only great food, but great service."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times since I moved here. Service and food are great. The chorizo omelet is definitely a good breakfast."}
{"text":"I was hoping to find a nice alternative to the limited choices on MC85. I was disappointed. The sandwich was bland. Definitely not worth the price. I was given homemade potato chips which damn near broke my teeth because they were so hard. It's the same food as Millstone Cafe but without any flavor. If I'm going to pay that much for a sandwich, I expect it to taste better than average. :("}
{"text":"Today I enjoyed my first trip to Cafe 25:35 in Buckeye, AZ. I had their Cadrew that came with Chicken Fried Steak, savory gravy, Two Eggs, Cafe Fries, Bacon, Sourdough Toast, and Two Homemade Pancakes. I finished every bite, except for a portion of the eggs, which is my only small complaint, they were a tad overlooked... Overall a great experience, and worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Deeeelicoous and awesome service. We stopped here with a party of 9 and everyone was happy with their burgers and sandwiches. Try the iced coffee! We're from Riverside, CA and will definitely stop by next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great move making it Into a full service restaurant. The service was excellent. Cinnamon roll is a must!"}
{"text":"Every single thing was delicious!! I got the Tonys garlic burger with the sweet potatoes fries. And the service was friendly and prompt. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have loved this place since the day it opened and still do to this very day. To start the place is country adorable!!!! (I know, but I'm a girl, we like these things). The food is creative and delicious! I will always recommend the grilled cheese... It has BACON on it!!! You can't go wrong with bacon! The staff is super nice and the service is quick. Being from Buckeye, you don't get a lot of good options on this side of town but this place is as good as any \"Scottsdale\" breakfast joint I have ever eaten at. Do yourself a favor and GO!"}
{"text":"Very friendly excellent food serenaded by a guitar player who is very good food was excellent price was right"}
{"text":"Awesome Buckeye boy breakfast! My 2nd time here when in town, i gotta have this breakfast.  Love the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"OH. MY. WORD. Fabulous. I had the Rainbow Valley, he had the Palo Verde. Absolutely FABulous, and those in-house chips were wonderful. If you haven't eaten here yet, go. They're only open until 2 pm, so hurry. Just put the car keys on the table right by the door so you don't have to fumble for them. And while you're there, make sure to order a cinnamon roll. You won't believe how nummy they are. That frosting... can't quite figure out how they made it, but I'm pretty sure white puffy clouds were one of the ingredients. Now if they only had a dinner service..."}
{"text":"Zero complaints. Great good. Great coffee and even better service! Might be our new breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"For Buckeye-this place is most definitely a 4 star rating!!  The place is cute-love the name and the reason behind the name.  Went here for lunch with some friends after hearing some good reviews and it was very good.  I had the Reuben sandwich on a pretzel roll, which was small but great.  The homemade chips and seasoned fries were also very good.  I saw some other sandwiches on the menu that I would also like to try.  I also hear that breakfasts are good, so I need to get there and try that as well."}
{"text":"Nice spot, very welcoming. Staff was amazing and quick. We originally came in for breakfast but we forgot Arizona was an hour ahead, so we missed it.  The lunch was amazing....all in house made sauces. Palo Verde was on point and house made chips to compliment it were good. Group had BLT, Crazy Frank burger, and the PB one. Super satisfied....great spot. Good thing we stopped in Buckeye enroute to Spring Training"}
{"text":"It is a great atmosphere with very friendly people. Unfortunately it is a little small so if you have large groups this would be a tough place to get all into. Their menu is excellent and very good food. I would like to see some variety in their soups and salads personally. I've been going here a while and I'm ready for them to come up with something different. Their coffee is amazing! Great place a lunch date, meeting with a coworker or interview for a new job!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast. They had no ham or sausage. It took one hour to get a croissant sandwich and an order which was only eggs, bacon, and potatoes. Food was fine but very slow cooks!"}
{"text":"This place is always a 5 star place. I had the Eggs Benedict. The gravy was so tasty! I did order the eggs over medium because I don't like runny white. The and the eggs were over cooked. I didn't have time for the order to be fixed but it was still so good. I will be back! The place is always clean and neat."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast and lunch options. Friendly staff and atmosphere. My go to breakfast spot on days off."}
{"text":"Look..... this place is probably the best American food in town.... the ingredients are locally sourced and homemade. They name food after crazy homeless guys that wander around the neighborhood, and they put peanut butter on a burger and it is delicious."}
{"text":"We live this place. Its clean, the staff is friendly and the food is awesome!  Highly recommend cafe 25:35"}
{"text":"The only downfall about this place is that it's not open long enough! Lol. The staff is super friendly and the age group that comes into this little Buckeye gem varies from 20-65 on average. When I came in, I let the staff know that it was my first time visiting and they were SUPER accommodating! They also had live music here on this Saturday morning which was great. The music gave me a Johnny's Cash feel. Once the live music ended they began playing country music on the station. It's a very homestyle/rustic feel and I love it. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have eaten lunch here several times so decided to try breakfast today.  Homemade cinnamon rolls are outstanding- similar to Cinnabon but much better.  Smallish menu but all the bases are covered.  Exceptional service and everything is homemade.  Lots of flavor and good sized servings.  We drive 30+ minutes to eat here and it is well worth it.  Great locally owned business - try it!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Good food and service. I like the Garlic Burger. Breakfast is good as well."}
{"text":"Great food and curteous staff! Support local businesses; no thanks Denny's or Starbucks I'll take Cafe 25:35 any day!!!

I had their Buckeye a Big Boy breakfast and coffee, honestly I couldn't find anything to complain about. It was very good and more than reasonably priced. My wife and I will become regulars of Cafe 25:35 going forward."}
{"text":"Well, I can honestly say this place is an oasis in the desert!  What a wonderful addition to a cute little town. Being from L.A.,  I was on my way back from Phoenix, and thankfully found this little gem along the way. What a relief after the monotonous southwestern restaurants and rest-stop fast food joints one tends to find in these parts. The coffee was hot and robust, the eggs light and fluffy, and the ingredients in my omelet were fresh and tasty. Also, I found the menu to be well balanced and diverse without being overwhelming, and the fresh fruit side, was indeed  very fresh!  I don't normally find myself traveling this way,  but if I ever do again I would go out of my way to back to Cafe 25 35 in Buckeye!!"}
{"text":"First time visit having lunch with a friend!!  Service was excellent, friendly personable.  My friend had the Wickenburg sandwich and I had the grilled cheese.  Awwwwwwesome!!  We took the last of the cinnamon rolls and sesame seed muffin - deeeeelicioussss!  I'm going back!!!"}
{"text":"SUCH a pleasant atmosphere, super delicious meals, the roast beef and mushroom sandwich was excellent and the philly cheese steak was on point! The seasoned fries had a tasty southwest flavor, the food presentation and service was the absolute BEST EVER!"}
{"text":"We were there for lunch 6/12/17, and found it to be pretty pricey for what you get; the burgers were good, but the grilled cheese sandwich actually had TOO MUCH bacon (something I never thought I would ever say) and it was very hard to bite through.  The cheese was non-existent, too much arugula, and the whole sandwich tasted like old oil, as if the grill hadn't been cleaned in a long time.  It is a really cute place and the hostess/waitress was very friendly, but it wasn't worth the amount we paid for our meal."}
{"text":"Loved the relaxing atmosphere. Great food and coffee.  Wish we had found this cafe sooner."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast.   Took ten minutes to get a menu, another 15 to get our drinks and about 25 to get our food

Ordered one biscuit and gravy and boyfriend ordered a special they have available.  
Biscuit was not home made and was very mushy
Gravy was ok, sadly I do not think it's home made. But likely from a mix of some sort"}
{"text":"Arlington burger was fantastic. Loved the fresh bun, so good. Wife had the southwest chicken sandwich which was really good. Sweet potato fries were yummy. Really friendly staff."}
{"text":"I appreciate the effort these people are doing for the revitalization of Old Town Buckeye.  They did a fantasic job of tranforming an old bar into a nice lunch place.  The food was good, they were plenty busy."}
{"text":"Great place, good prices, amazing home cooked food. I enjoy visiting the establishment."}
{"text":"Odd name and tasty food

Not sure if the name was an accident on the window order, but this place has the goods when it comes to tasty food.  Stopped by for a work lunch when some folks at Buckeye City Hall recommended it.  Club was excellent and the avocado and spicy sauce (horseradish?) were excellent together.  My colleagues also raved about their meals.  When so many of these cafes taste the same, it's cool to see a novel restaurant in the downtown of a small city doing cool things.  Even the cafe-made chips, which I usually detest, were good."}
{"text":"Great cinnamon rolls and coffee. It's a shame the open hours are limited but everything is made in house and fresh. #1 place in Buckeye for fresh, made from scratch food."}
{"text":"A friend and I consider this our \"catch-up\" spot for breakfast. Always fresh and delicious and they tolerate our 3-4 hour gab sessions beautifully! :)"}
{"text":"The place has definitely changed since my last few times I've eaten here.

-Higher prices on the burgers. Had to pay extra for fries, else you get a side of chips. 4$(!!) for an extra patty.

-The burgers have a new seasoning, my coworker compared it to taco seasoning.

-The waitresses used to be so friendly, two new ones are working here now. We kind of just stood at the front door waiting to be seated or acknowledged. Had to ask for a straw. 

-Crazy frank burger is now on the menu, doesn't taste the same as it was off the menu. Probably because Of the new seasonings.

We used to rave about this place, kinda lost a few notches. Not sure if we'll be back as frequent."}
{"text":"Ehrmagerd! Had lunch there twice now. Food is great, service is friendly! Definitely a welcome sight for sore eyes and hungry stomachs in the chain restaurant infested Buckeye! Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I went in for lunch with my daughter and was very disappointed, first there was no kids burger on their menu so ok I bought her a burger off of the regular menu. I ordered the Reuben. Our order took like 20 minutes and what's worse is that I kept looking back and saw a plate up under the lights, when I went up to ask how much longer, the cashier got upset and told me there was a big order ahead of me, but then she gave me the plate that had been sitting there the whole time :( my daughters burger was ok my Reuben was super dry, the fries were very good. My overall experience was not what I expected especially for the price."}
{"text":"Oh my word this place is the best. The food is  great quality. We ordered the Kimmy and the Arlington. These items were a wonderful blend of flavors. The Kimmy is a turkey sandwich with a wonderful blend of textures and flavors. The sweet potato French fries were awesome! We cannot wait to return"}
{"text":"Great good and wonderful service! People were very friendly. Prices are very reasonable. Cinnamon rolls are amazing. They even made me a burger at 730 am!! Stop here for sure!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place on three different occasions, so I've definitely given them a chance. not good. not nasty but not good. ZERO FLAVOR! coffee is good. staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Some of the best food in the Buckeye area! Great people, excellent service, delicious food. 
We come here often because we have found the people, food, and atmosphere so good.  Its a great cafe, but do not go on a Sunday or after 2pm any other day... it will be closed."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Buckeye and found Cafe 25:35 on Yelp. What a great find! Atmosphere is relaxed and food is great. This is our new go to spot."}
{"text":"Passing through to Scottsdale & found Cafe 25:35. What a gem of a place! I had a Reuben sandwich on a pretzel bun with an excellent coleslaw. My hubby had a Bleu cheese mushroom burger with sweet potato fries ( he said the best he's ever had). Kudos to the chef & the wait staff. I would definitely go out of my way to return for another heavenly meal. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Good place to go in Buckeye. Love the look, the food is really good, and they are a great addition to buckeye."}
{"text":"Here's my dilemma , I feel I need to show my gratitude to Cafe 25:35. At the same time I know there will come a day when everyone knows about Cafe 25:35 and it will get crowded , there will be long waits and maybe some parking issues due to demand. But for now thank you for making one of the best burgers I've ever had. Comfortable seating , Friendly Staff , and great food and drink. Tim McGreevy told me about this place and I had to try it. I asked what the best items on the menu are. After finding out I did what all Americans do. I picked something else , Tonys Garlic Burger. I'll tell you what if that's not in the top 3 this place is more awesome than I can imagine. Property values in Buckeye just went up."}
{"text":"It takes balls to open a higher end eatery in old Buckeye, but with the quality of food provided, I hope this becomes a destination restaurant. I had the Roasted Border omellete for breakfast and it was wonderful. Quality throughout with fresh tomatillo salsa, green chilies inside, and home fried potatoes to die for. This place does delicious food, not half assed massive portions for the typical patron of Denny's, so don't complain about not having a plate the size of a hubcap. It's wonderful food at a reasonable price. I'll be coming back for lunch....maybe today."}
{"text":"I should have had the chicken sandwich like i originally intended. I foolishly ordered a salad and ended up picking out the chicken and beans from it. It was like the toppings were too small for how big they cut the lettuce. The dressing was ok but I just felt kinda sick after having eaten it.  I felt like such a Californian. Health nut."}
{"text":"Have ate here twice and only ever been to the area twice. Amazing food! So fresh. And the best coffee I have had in a long time. I wish I could take this place with me!"}
{"text":"After going back for breakfast I have sadly had to re-do my opinion of Cafe 25:35. I recently visited, this time I ordered breakfast. It was pretty bad. I the \"early riser\" the scrambled eggs were flat and were cooked in a ring, when I think of scrambled eggs I 
want fluffy, light eggs. NOT a flat dry ring. The sausage was a circle, that you could buy at the store in the frozen department. It even tasted frozen. 

Perhaps the eggs is their technique, but I certainly don't appreciate it. Also the plate could barely fit all the food they put on the plate. 

The only redeemable thing on the plate was the seasoned potatoes, however the potatoes squares, and it  is advertised as fries.

Now with all that said I still love their fries (hot crispy outside, soft center), and their hot sandwiches as well."}
