{"text":"Service in store is great.  If you phone to order,  you are left feeling like an inconvenience.  Food is ok.  Order fresh.  Service has declined."}
{"text":"Simply the best. Better than all the rest. (Lol) seriously, great food, nice staff. Enjoy everything from their pizza, spaghetti, lasagna, and subs. It's all good."}
{"text":"I'm from NYC and I can truly say that this is one of the best pizzerias that I have tried.  A little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Pizza is just as good as any Brooklyn pizzeria!  Authentic nyc pizza! Excellent !  Excellent ! Excellent!  Never tried anything else except the pizza tho so cannot comment on any other menu items."}
{"text":"Some of the best New York style pizza I have ever had!! The staff was beyond friendly and helpful and the prices were very fair!"}
{"text":"Great subs, calzones, and the like. Good italian ingredients make for good food. These guys use the right stuff to cook with and put together a sub. Only draw back was that you really didn't know what to do with your plates, do you leave them, put them on the shelf buy the trash, what? We must not be the only ones, we went this week and there was a home made sign which read, \"Please leave plates.....on the table\" EX! Now you can go and not feel guilty leaving stuff on the table or stressed trying to stack them up on the narrow shelf without breaking anything. Great place."}
{"text":"My wife and I were passing through and had a hankering for pizza.  We really lucked out with this place!  The pizza is NICE! They have a great house made balsamic vinaigrette. We also tried this little Jamaican meat pie that was sort of like an empanada with jerk spiced ground beef filling. Oh, so tasty!
Anyway, check this place out if you live in Kannapolis or are just passing through.  We will for sure."}
{"text":"Best pizza around its fresh, authentic, and quick."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! I had the bruschetta and my husband had the Rosario but they all looked amazing! The crust is fantastic and everything is so fresh."}
{"text":"If your not a yankee don't even bother, You would just complain about the prices.  Not a real nice place more of a lunch cafe style take out place but the food is awesome the people are \"straight off the boat\" Italian and the food tells the story!!"}
{"text":"I miss Queens, my motherland. 
That being said, Rosario's absolutely has the best pizza I've had in NC.
But it's not just the pizza! The atmosphere is incredible. It may not seem like much to most people, but from the moment I walked in, I was taken back to Queens for a moment. It looks, smells and feels like a pizzeria back home AND has the pizza to prove it.
Sit down with a cheese slice and a cup of coke and take it all in."}
{"text":"Real damn pizza. Anyone from the North would tell you this is quality pizza. The guy is Sicilian and knows his stuff. Try literally anything on the menu and you will enjoy. The cannolis are ok here, at least 4 stars. Sfogliatelle here is actually pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Now I love pizza I'm like the pizza queen I eat pizza every day and I'm not just saying that! I literlery eat pizz everyday! My most favorite around here well in kannapolis is Pizza Hut or papa johns but I love trying new pizza restaurants but this one I have to say is not my favorite! I ordered a slice to go and I couldn't eat no more it was gross so I'll never be back! Some things you like And some you do not like!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed in Rosario's. Went and picked up a large Pepperoni Pizza, Garlic knots and a large house salad. Got home to find a plain cheese and when I called they just said sorry, you can drive back and we can make you a new pizza. NO THANKS! You used to deliver to my neighborhood, stopped that and now you tell me, oops, sorry, feel free to drive back and we will fix it, otherwise you are out of luck. Awful customer service. Thanks Rosario's for charging me for a large Pepperoni and telling me I can drive back to fix the problem.
And by the way, the salad was brown! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Rosario's is more than NY style pizza. Rosario's is authentic Sicilian dining, the owner is from Palermo.  You must try their Stromboli, meat roll, and veal parmigiana. Don't forget the Greek salad, garlic knots and of course finish your meal with a cannoli."}
{"text":"VERY BAD EXPERIENCE!!! First let me put out there that that I've had many different pizzas in many different regions in the U.S. Including New York, Chicago, and Phoenix. The restaurant atmosphere was very nice, and from the time I walked in I was instantly reminded of a Brooklyn Pizzeria. Well this quickly changed! The pizza came to the table, I let it cool off for awhile before picking up a slice which instantly fell apart in my hands, so now I have to use a fork and knife to eat 95% of the slice, GREAT! So I eat that slice with a fork and knife, which was very greasy by the way. In my 19 years of eating pizza I don't think I've had worse. So at the end of the meal when the owner was making his rounds to talk to the customers, I simply told him I wasn't too impressed, but it wasn't a big deal. He immediately snapped with a rather rude attitude, as I explained my issues with the pizza saying that I don't know anything about pizza as he walks off into the back. His daughter then thought it was appropriate to make a rude comment to me and my friend. At this point we walked out noting we would never be going back! SIMPLY JUST A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza.  The variety is excellent.  Best pizza around.  The Grandma's recipe is very good, as is the egg plant and Sicilian."}
{"text":"Best pizza in concord. My favorite is the Bruschetta Pizza, it is outstanding and filling. My family of four eats here nearly once a week and our order is never more than $22. The service is fabulous. It is truly a family establishment. Warm reception by the owners. Great pizza by the slice deal. This place is a gem for lunch or dinner. Fresh, Delicious  and Fast. My ALL TIME favorite."}
{"text":"Will never go there again after being treated awfully by the owner Roberto over the phone and he hung up on me after asking him about the salad being soggy and if there was something he could do to replace or give credit for next time since I had them take out to go. NO REFUNDS!! That's how he treats customers?? We have been going there for few yrs since moving to Concord from Charlotte. Will go back to Due Amici for better service in Charlotte w respect and little longer drive but the owner Paolo from DM treats me very well!  Thank god he doesn't share or own w his jerk brother Roberto!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time.  Wow.  Great food. Recommend the chicken Marsala pizza"}
{"text":"In my opinion, it's as close to a New York styled pizzeria as you will get in the area (including Charlotte). We drove from the Dilworth area of Charlotte to try this place out as we were going to be in the Concord area and wanted some pizza. We checked out the reviews for this place and were impressed enough by the pictures and reviews to go and check it out. They have a clear case where you can choose individual slices, which was awesome! They even have a grandmas style pizza which is seen in many stores in NY, your typical thick airy square shaped crust with lots of sauce and cheese. So good and probably both my favorite as well as my husband's. The bruschetta pizza is also incredible! Italian and family owned and ran. Super friendly staff! Gets a little busy on weekend nights (like no kidding, line out the door busy!) so come early! Love this place, it's our favorite."}
{"text":"Great pizza, quick service and friendly staff.   Pizza can be a bit greasy.   Gets busy at peak times."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelpers stopped here with the family on drive from Maryland to Atlanta. Can't believe this place is in Concord, NC. Reminded me of the mom- and -pop places in NY and Philly. Pizza is great and the meat roll delicious!"}
{"text":"Simply THE best New York style pizza in the area.  It just can't be beaten so long as you like your pizza hot, thin and not just a little bit greasy (the way pizza is supposed to be).  Their garlic pizza is simply awesome - gooey cheese infused with powerful roasted garlic.  Their pepperoni is another family favorite.  These are pies that you won't need to order extra cheese for - they're already fully loaded.

Service is good and the place is very clean too (if not all that attractive)."}
{"text":"This pizzeria is EXCELLENT !! Definitely a 5star in my book, which is saying a lot ..originally from NY and used to make pizza for almost 10yrs. Before coming to the Charlotte area. Employees/owners were super nice, food was excellent, closets thing your gonna get to \"NY\" pizza Grandma pizza was really really good"}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza.  Fresh thin crust.  Generous cheese.  Quality toppings.  If you want delicious pizza from a local place then you should try Rosario's."}
{"text":"I'm a New York pizza snob surviving best I can in NC. I'm going to give this to you short straight and to the point. After over eight years of dealing with subpar, nasty crappy pizza, this is BY FAR the BEST pizza in NC.  If you're from NY/NJ this means something to you, so act accordingly. If you're not, then disregard and go to Bojangles for lunch.  I will also say this... Specialty pizzas are here and in abundance. Decent Grandma pizza which I haven't had since Times Square. Sausage special is incredible. I live an hour from this place but I make the trip. Fuhgetaboudit."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Real New York style pizza right here in Concord. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Surprised to see this many good reviews. Pizza is below average, sauce tastes spicy hot, not good. Also has black pepper mixed in for some reason I don't know. The Sicilian needs improvements, could use more sauce and cheese for the thicker slice."}
{"text":"The Pizza here is one of the best in Concord. I have a few friends from NY and NJ and they say this is the closest to NY pizza they have had since living here. Slices are huge and a little greasy but to most that's a sign of a good pizza!"}
{"text":"Sooo good. This pizza is really good, best in Concord if you ask me. They can be a little pricey if you are comparing it to chains like pizza hut, but well worth it, at least when you eat this pizza you know it is fresh and has good quality ingredients.They also have pizza by the slice."}
{"text":"The antipasto salad is absolutely the best here and Italian dressing is awesome.  Have enjoyed everything that I have tried.  Great place to pick up a pizza pie and take home after you've done your grocery shopping at Food Lion"}
{"text":"Best chicken parm hero I've had in forever!!!  Go Tigers!!!"}
{"text":"I took the family here based on Yelp Reviews when down the street at Great Wolf Lodge.  Some notes:

1) The pizza is very, very good.  Slices are enormous and tasty, with just the right amount of crisp.  I am a bit of a pizza snob and loved it here.  Their specialty slices looked tasty, but I didnt try one.  My wife said her Chicken Marsala slice was very tasty, but had just too much cheese on it to be excellent or for her to be able to finish it.

2) Our salad was excellent.  Tasty olives, great dressing, fresh veggies and salad, and a huge portion.  Wish I loved closer so I could get this all the time.

3) Overall restaurant was clean, service was excellent, and it was clearly owner operated in the best sense of the term.

I would definitely recommend this for anyone in the area.  If you are traveling with your family, it might be better economically to avoid the slices and just get a pizza.  Still, the price of a slice was reasonable but it added up to a little more than a pizza would have been.

Great place :)"}
{"text":"Great place! I have only ever ordered take out, which is fast and easy. They have delicious pizza- great portion sizes and well priced.

My family always orders one cheese and one pepperoni pizza. Pep is my favorite! So good for a cheat night when all you want is a really cheesy, thin slice of pizza! It is also a crowd pleaser for big groups."}
{"text":"Chicken Parm pizza is amazing. Never had anything like it. The White pie was pretty good but that Chicken Parm was so good. Slices are huge and one slice of the Chicken Parm is super filling. Get it!"}
{"text":"Ordered a couple slices, pretty decent. Thin and greasy, close to ny style like they claim to be. The employees seemed nice though the guy who rang us out ran off to talk to another customer so I had to wait for my receipt. We ordered a couple fountain drinks and he didn't tell us that we could just grab a cup, I had to ask. Since it was my first time there I was unaware of their processes so it would have been nice if they told me to just grab the cup on my own. They also serve the food on plastic dishes and we were unsure of where to take them after, there didn't seem to be enough room at the trash can area. Overall it was good, some things could have been a little better to earn the 5 star, but pizza was good enough for the 4 star."}
{"text":"Yum.  

Like all the other reviews, this place is awesome.  Their pizza is the real deal.  I've also had their pepperoni rolls and calzones and let me say that they are every bit as tasty as the pizzas.  

Whenever I'm in the mood for a NY Style pizza or heck just a good quality pizza then I hit up Rosarios.  

I just wish they were open all the time!"}
{"text":"Good Pizza, EXCELLENT PEOPLE WORKING THERE!!!!!!
DO NOT ORDER a Calzone if you are used to a Real \"Made To Order\" Real NY-Pizzeria Calzone.
(They make them at 10-A.M. and \"stuff\" fresh toppings into Stale calzones which they sell to idiots (like me) that are suckered into ordering what we should have known is only available in the North East. I would not have ordered it if the order taker had not said \"YES\" when I asked if they were made \"fresh to order\".
Still OK for North Carolina as far as Pizza and Pizza only is concerned."}
{"text":"Good authentic ny style pizzas by the slice. I'll def be back. Can't wait to try the pastas and grinders."}
{"text":"IMO/... this is the best Pizza in town!  I used to always eat from Pizza Hut- which gives me heartburn, but this place reminded me of childhood once I took my first bite.  My mom used to take me and my sister to get Pizza at this place in Chapel Hill.  It was love at first bite.  I usually stick with the normal and get a Pepporoni slice, it's huge and worth the price."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza just the way I like it with thin and crispy crust! But not lacking on the toppings at all! Super friendly and clean. Very generous with the toppings and the cheese.  Just visiting from Texas looked up a good pizza place and it had good reviews so we tried it. If you're looking for a great pizza this is it. It was my boyfriend and I and we got the medium and had leftovers!!"}
{"text":"First time I ate here after living in Concord for over 20 years. Great find and great food!  We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"What a great find...  

We've been searching for a good Italian/Pzza restaurant since we recently moved to the area.  Ordered a pizza to go last Friday night and we were a little concerned because of the distance from our home.  Well, it was worth the drive.

My wife went in to get it while I waited in the car.  Mamma Mia, the wonderful aroma outside was enchanting-I can only imagine what it like inside.  We got home to discover the light crispness of the crust, with just the right amount of sauce, fresh vegetables and delicious cheese!

We have a winner and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Have to agree with previous reviewer, Joshua.  Good food, but pricey."}
{"text":"Holy toppings!! I got a veggie slice and it was overflowing with mushrooms, tomatoes, sun dried tomatoes, onions and green olives. I love pizza with green olives, so this made me very happy! I also ordered a supreme and it had black olives, peppers, sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms and onions. I probably could've had just one slice, but I am a glutton so that wasn't happening. The crust was thin, crispy and just the right amount of chew. The sauce was plentiful and flavorful. Some of the better pizza I have had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Real NY Pizza...in fact, better than the pizza I had in NY just the other month...and no I didn't pull a Michael Scott and hit up Sbarro's. :) 

 I've been coming to this place a long time and they have seen me as a newlywed, pregnant and watched my baby grow into a talkative 3 year old. The owners are friendly and so are the employee's and always ask about the family when we go. 

The pizza is great and they sell by the slice if you don't want to order a whole pie. Some of our favorites are the white pizza, vegetarian (sun dried tomatoes are great),  sausage and the grandma (cheese on the bread and tomato sauce on top). Also, the antipasto salad is huge and delicious. Fresh salad, thin sliced red onion, roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, fresh mozzarella, kalamata olives and lots of cold meat. The garlic knots are brimming with crushed garlic and a great combination of crisp outside and soft innards. Perfection!  

If you are ever in the mood for great NY style pizza stop by here. I wish I could give them 10 stars!"}
{"text":"Got the Sicilian style pizza. It was much bigger than I expected. But it was good!  We got carry out, but when I picked up the order it seemed like a nice clean place to get a slice. Employees seemed nice too. Really want to try the NY style soon."}
{"text":"I'm a pizza aficionado.....the only place I haven't eaten pizza is italy/sicily. With that being said this ranks in my top 3 pizza pies in North Carolina....the crust is PERFECT! The toppings are fresh as if they were grown picked cured or curdled this morning!!!! The service is friendly, prompt, & the atmosphere is vintage NY pizza. I will be back here......VERY SOON!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite pizza in town for many years. The owners are awesome. the food is amazing! Every person from NY that I have taken there LOVES the pizza and the experience."}
{"text":"Great little pizza spot in Concord?  Who knew!  Nice, thin, crispy crust just how pizza should be and I'm sorry.......is that italian ice?  I'll definitely have a scoop of that and the pasta...yep homemade sauces made in house which the Sicilian owner gladly let me sample......so there is no heat and serve pasta here.......the lasagna is layered up, cheesed up, and sauced up and baked once you order....sweet!"}
{"text":"This is hands-down the BEST pizza I have ever had. Closest to NY pizza you will find. Their dough is amazing. The crust is crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. My favorite pizza is the Margherita (basil, fresh mozzarella & tomato sauce). Their garlic knot sandwiches are incredible and come in eggplant parmigiana and chicken parmigiana. Flavor Flavor Flavor!! The staff is nice and it doesn't take too long to get your food. I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place, heard a lot about this place. New York style pizza, okay!! I have had a lot of NY style pizza. Which is known for it's thin crispy crust. I was totally disappointed, the crust was floppy, and had no flavor. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place was a little too family friendly for me. Kids running around and screaming. 
Counter service was hectic and disorganized. It took a more than 10 minutes to get a slice of cheese pizza but the guy who finally got my pizza was apologetic and my slice was tasty."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Very Very close to northeast pizza. Huge slices. The counter staff were nice and polite. Good stuff!!! was there summer of 2013 but forgot to post my review."}
{"text":"I came through Concord on an errand of sorts. I went to a bakery nearby that was 'out of bagels' so I needed sustenance for lunch. I found Rosario's via Yelp. I went there for a slice of pepperoni pizza.  It was so so so so so so so so so so good. I am from NY, which doesn't make me special. But, I know my NY pizza. Rosario's is so authentic. I love it. It's cooked perfectly as I like it, not underdone, not overdone but **perfect**! The sauce was great, good spice level and the whole darn experience was reminiscent of the NY pizzeria. I love this place and will travel up to Concord again from Charlotte to get their pizza. thank you Rosarios!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Huntersville Concord area and very reasonably priced. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm updating a review for the third time... But I just simply can't stay away from this outstanding food.

The best part? Not only has their quality improved (which wasn't even my pet peeve to begin with) but they're adding great stuff to the menu, instead of just the same old stuff! The Eggplant Parmesan Garlic Knots, as well as the similar Chicken Parmesan version, for sure one of the best things I've ever gotten from a pizza place before.

Oh, and good on you for reiterating customer service. Gone are the days of blank faces at the service counter. The cute girl with glasses  at the cash register? Yeah, keep her around, very quick and friendly; mirror opposite experience from the early days at Rosario's.

I hated to give those 2 stars all that time ago.. But at least it tells a story of a restaurant that has adapted and thrived. I'm hoping the redemption is reciprocated with consistency!"}
{"text":"The pizza and food here was very, very good.  We tried the fried ravioli, couple types or pizza and some kind of stuffed roll that I think they call a pinwheel.  Everything was excellent.  It's a little more expensive than other places, but the food was very authentic!

I could have been more impressed with the staff, here, however.  We were there about 45 mintues prior to closing time, but the staff was ready to go before we ever got through the door.  We weren't trying to linger, but I felt we were rushed and that our business wasn't appreciated."}
{"text":"I have had three pizza's from here, the first one was great the next two were pitiful.  The last one had three items left off the pizza and looked like it came from the display case under the counter.  A no go pizza zone."}
{"text":"Another delicious meal at Rosario's!  MOST authentic NYC pizza in SC and NC. Cannoli's and Italian ice were equally as wonderful. Worth the near 2 hour drive!"}
{"text":"I don't like pizza that has dried oregano just sprinkled over the top after it has come out of the oven. My husband is elderly and has a smaller appetite. He wanted to order a childs portion, but the counter gal argued with him that it was only for kids.. talk about age discrimination! The spaghetti was nothing to brag about.. just run of the mill sauce. I doubt we will be back. I also worry about pizza sitting in  a case at room tempurature..there is meat on it! It is spoiling.It also makes me wonder how clean this place is."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Rosario's for years. The pizza is always incredible and the place is family owned and operated.

Today, I had the chicken parmesan garlic knot. It's basically a huge, soft garlic knot that's been cut in half and stuff with a piece of cheese, sauce, and a  hand-breaded chicken cutlet. Be sure to give it a try next time you're around."}
{"text":"Amazing New York pizza! Fresh ingredients. The slices are so big you have to fold them in half! Quick service also."}
{"text":"I work in the area, so I usually order carry-out style. As a 'yankee,' I will say that the pizza is good but it's not 'amazing.' and I've definitely had better NY-style pizza down here. 

I've had the eggplant parm sub lunch special and it's pretty good. the lunch special includes chips (no drink), but the two times that I've ordered, the chips have tasted stale. I thought it was a fluke the first time but I've learned my lesson the second go-round. 

I have to note that the service is not that great (at least when I check out), one of the employees (who happens to be female) leaves a lot to be desired in the customer service department. I'm not looking for a smile and some sort of sparkling greeting, but I do expect a \"hello.\"

If you're looking to grab a quick slice to satisfy a pizza craving, I'd recommend giving rosario's a try."}
{"text":"I love there pizza! Delicious fresh Ny style pizza. Now, If you haven't tried there zepolis you are truly missing out. Close your eyes, and imagine the best funnel cake you have ever had. Now amplify that, because these fat balls of dough covered in powered sugar is just a mouth watering treat to end any of there delicious Italian dinners."}
{"text":"A friend suggested that I try Rosario's Pizza when I first moved to the area. I didn't want to be disappointed, so I kept putting off trying it. I finally broke down and tried the pizza a couple of weeks ago and it was AWESOME! I went back a week or so later I returned and tried the spaghetti with meat sauce and garlic knots - another awesome meal there! Try Rosario's if you are looking for an authentic Italian meal. 

As a bonus - the owners are friendly and welcoming...not to mention that the tiramisu is delicious and is a huge portion!"}
{"text":"I'm in between a 3/4 stars so 3.5? But anyways the pizza looked fantastic, and the slices are so huge! We ordered a large, half cheese and half mushroom & pineapple. The plain cheese honestly was so chewy, and it tasted like the pizza has been out for a while, not fresh out the oven ya know ? The mushroom & pineapple was a bit better, the cheese wasn't as tough and a bit softer. The pizza sauce was a lil way too salty, but I did enjoy the dough & the thinness of the crust! I wished I enjoyed the pizza more because it's sooo close to my home plus it's a local business! Maybe I'll give it another try again sometime."}
{"text":"Best pizza in North Carolina!!  Good NY Style attitudes but not in an assholey way!  Their calzones are also the f-ing bomb!"}
{"text":"I guess it's not fair to have a Chicagoan judging the pizza in North Carolina, but here goes. I'm not a fan of pizza sitting around waiting to be purchased so we decided to order a whole pie as oppose to ordering a couple of slices from behind the glass. 

There is no table service so you place your order and have a seat, they'll bring it out and they'll also pick it up at the end of your meal so don't feel bad leaving your mess at the table. They were pretty friendly and the place seems clean. They have a sigh over the soda machine that strictly enforces NO SHARING! But refills are FREE! 

 Ok now to the important stuff! The medium Pie was around 12$ and a perfect size for 2-3 people. The pizza was pretty basic and average at best. They're definitely not using top quality mozzarella and their crust was flavorless. I had high expectations based on the \"4 stars\" but they fall short."}
{"text":"Rosario's has easily become our only Go To for incredible pizza.  Whether you are just needing a slice or feeding the whole family we highly recommend.  I lived in Italy for 3 years and it is by far the best pizza we have had since back in the states.  My husband is from NY and swears Rosario's is just like the pizza back home.  I have only had the Chicken Marsala on the dishes menu and it was delicious.  Try the stuffed pizza when you have a large crowd.  It only comes in large but you get so many toppings and with 2 crust my family of 4 (2 teenage boys that have 2 stomachs each) always have leftovers.  The garlic knots and pizza rolls are really good as well.  

If you want real pizza, skip all the others and head to Rosario's, you will not be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"I picked up my niece from school for a surprise lunch. We ordered meat lovers pizza and garlic knots. We got there right at 11 so I'm not sure if this pizza was from the night before. We both never have been so sick in our lives. I was just passing thru town and picked her up for a quick lunch. So I know we both didn't eat the same food prior to coming here. I Guarantee I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Every time I am in the area I can't resist, I have to stop and get a slice! It reminds me of NYC!!"}
{"text":"In from outta town in business, hit Yelp for a great tip and got one -- Rosario's pizza is delicious!!  

As a pizza aficionado, always seeking a vreat pie -- found one!! 

Had a simple pepperoni mushroom. Full of flavor, lotsa cheese and inexpensive to boot. I will be back! Thanks Yelpers for the great outta towner tip, hit Rosaruos if ya want a great pie."}
{"text":"The pizza her is by far the best in town. I have never had a bad slice and the pizza is always cooked to perfection  It is a little pricey but i find it is worth it for the quality I am getting."}
{"text":"have been down there twice, both orders and have been wrong, and on one of them, the chesse fell off, wont go back."}
{"text":"Got a couple slices today, excellent pizza as close to NYC as you could get without being there. I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very Rude service but great pizza. So far the best in Nc I have had. I'm from up north and I approve. I will order to go again."}
{"text":"Have had real good slices of pizza on previous visits..  That being said, tonight's experience has turned me away from this place for good!!   I didn't see the previous reviews about the calzone and ordered one with Meatballs..  Just awful.... Was made earlier in the day, cut open and toppings stuffed in and reheated.  My son got kids chicken tenders and fries.   Fries came and were way over cooked, greasy and seemed like they were not fresh.  I went up to ask for some new fries and the owner, of all people, sat there and argued with me.   He kept saying his fries were fresh and there is no way they are not good etc.  etc.   Mind you we have had much better fries in the past.  He made a real scene about it and I couldn't believe it!  Very rude!!!!   He brings the new fries out, which were done correctly this time, and I expressed I had never had an experience such as this especially from an owner of a business......   Steer clear of this rude business owner!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Concord area by far. Very authentic and fresh with a lot of choices. Just be prepared to wait if you go in on a Friday night. Stick with pizza..the pasta dishes aren't the best."}
{"text":"This was nothing but warmed up food.  Not made fresh.  And garlic knots were too dry.  Wouldn't waste my money again!"}
{"text":"Walk into ANY pizzeria in NYC or one of its boroughs, and you've also walked into Rosario's! Totally by chance that I found this place, but man I'm I blessed to have found it! Now I don't have to do the 9+ hour drive to get real NY pizza! The moment you walk in and see the glass cabinets housing as many as 18 pizzas, you know this is the real deal! The downside, where on earth to start! So we sampled the Chicken Parm, Chicken Marsala, Pepperoni, Sicilian, Meat, and Rice Balls! The Chicken Parmesan was exactly like eating the actual dish you'd get in a Italian restaurant in say, Staten Island! The breaded chicken cutlets on a nice NY pizza crust was outstanding! The Chicken Marsala was as if you were sitting in a spot in Little Italy in lower Manhattan! The Meat pizza was so incredibly loaded with meat, but that distinctive Italian sausage made the slice! The Sicilian is like what you'll ONLY find in NYC! That thick, chewy, but light dough with a fabulous sauce soaked into that crust! If you've never had a Rice Ball from any pizzeria in NY, then you've done yourself an injustice. A ball of rice mixed with cheese, a meat interior, all covered in a Parmesan like breading, then deep fried to a crusty exterior! There is so much to choose from at Rosario's, but do yourself a favor and realize that life is full of hard decisions!"}
{"text":"I love this place and cater to it a lot. But today there were roaches on the drink machine and nobody took the time to rectify the matter they all stood around and gossiped and cleaned the machine as though nothing happened."}
{"text":"One thing I've found is when stopping off exits in small towns, you have to use Yelp on a curve. A 2* place in good food cities is about a 6* in many small towns. I guess pizza in a barbecue town gets infinitely higher. 

We were not impressed. Family thought pizza was just okay. My veal parmesan was merely a cheap piece of veal buried in cheese. The cheese was not Grande or any high quality. 

When I saw the owner checking out everyone on his security cameras like he was the security director at a casino or the White House, I should have known. 

Maybe a notch about chains, but just like I should expect good barbecue in small town North Dakota, I'm not going to get get pizza in Concord, NC."}
{"text":"Always awesome pizza here. But don't leave out the enormous rolls, paninis and appetizers. Still the best calamari in charlotte. Friendly staff and great food."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the sanitation grade posted behind the counter.  A 94.5 indicates that there's more than a few picky dings on their sanitation report.  The glass front food counter displays a huge selection of cold pizza combinations that they will heat up for you.  The pizza was pretty good.  I'm sure it was better when it was fresh out of the oven.  The house salad I got was not very good.  My wife also enjoyed her slice of pizza.  The signs on the ice machine warning you that you'll be forced to buy additional drinks if you are caught sharing your beverage is a little unnerving(as is the atmosphere.)  The desserts are wonderful.  The service was helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Best lasagna I've ever had!  I don't go there very often because I don't live in the area. But, when I'm in the area, I have to stop in for the lasagna. Still just as great as it was 10 years ago, when I had my first taste."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Concord. Best pizza in Charlotte, in fact, best pizza anywhere. Homemade mozzarella, homemade tiramisu, everything is great!!"}
{"text":"I don't care if they're hospitality is sometimes a little lacking or if they can tend to be more than just a little gruff. This place is the absolute hands down best pizza in all of Concord. And Charlotte. It's 100% as close as you'll ever get to NY pizza without making a trip to NYC. And it's consistently good! Make that GREAT. You can get a cheaper pie. You can also get a nicer environment. But you can't get a better pie anywhere near here. And besides the pizza itself, the rest of the menu is also on point. Just give it a try. You'll agree."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in town, it is owned by a family business and they are wonderful people as well as great food!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza. I enjoyed it and would go back.  However they really charge a premium.  A large pizza and a salad was $28.  That is steep."}
{"text":"We are used to Mazzios Pizza so we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into when we ordered the medium. The slices are HUGE and the pizza is so DELICIOUS!!! The ingredients are fresh and the service was so friendly. Highly recommend this pizza joint. you are not leaving hungry and are probably taking some home if you get a whole pizza. Its worth the short drive from the main Concord area. This family makes a point to know their regulars."}
{"text":"We were looking for a pizza place and based on reviews decided to try Rosario's. We have found a new pizza place.  A hidden gem! We absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars Because I know the man who owns it is very proud of his business and when he is there the place has a light atmosphere and everyone is happy and the food is excellent. I have gone 3 times when he wasn't there and there is a woman there that is in charge that is very miserable with herself. She doesn't smile she has an attitude and I have witnessed her screaming at the staff. The WHOLE staff is very nice except for her. Someone took my order tonight and I guess there was a slight miscommunication and they gave me a grilled cutlet instead of a fried cutlet.. this lady brought it to us and instead of appologizing and telling the cook to make it again she made some noise with her mouth and stomped away and then started screaming at the people in the back. This made me feel very sorry for them. It ruined my meal because the whole atmosphere was very tense after that. The poor workers were tiptoeing around. Then the lady in back of us tried to ask her a question and she pursed her lips and shakes her head...whomever this person is she needs to find another job because she is going to kill this man's business. I would also like to add that she was sweeping and kicking up dust while we were trying to eat and I find that very rude. It was nowhere near closing time. It was about 9pm."}
{"text":"It seems that several \"by the slice\" joints hang out in the Concord area, and that's okay, as we get up there with some regularity. Luckily, Rosario's is probably among the most convenient of the bunch, and has good service and a good selection of pies too.

I can't comment on their other food, since I've never made it past getting another slice of (whatever tickles my fancy at the moment), and that's just fine by me. I'll enjoy visiting Rosario's to check out their offerings whenever we get up that way."}
{"text":"Wow...great pizza and love that you can get it by the slice. Crust is amazing.  My son & I have been back several times."}
{"text":"Okay.  My first time ever writing a review and probably last.  This place definitely warrants this action.  Pizza is top-notch.  I recently relocated from the North East and with one bite of the tasty slice- I felt like I was back in N.Y., minus the 13 hr. drive.  Best pizza in recent memory.  Those guys know and love what they're doing.  You can tell that, the moment you open the box.  Can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Admittedly it's a bit tough to walk past this place, smell it and not end up stopping in!  My husband and I can be a bit pizza snobby sometimes but the smell drew us in!  We didn't want to commit to a whole pizza in just one flavor so we grabbed a few slices to try.  We ordered the stuffed slice and the grandmas slice.  They were huge!  We split both and I kept looking at my plate thinking I had the entire slice!  They had garlic on the table, too which is really the way to our hearts!  The restaurant itself is a little bland but the atmosphere doesn't suffer nor does the service.  We will be back to try more of the vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Great pizza place! Great ingredients like we've never tasted! Their meatball topping is fantastic! They also had gluten free pizza. They have a crust and you can put whatever toppings on it you like. Their cheese is also phenomenal! The GF pizza is a 10\" pie and was cooked great! The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about gluten cross contamination and stated if your condition is severe we don't recommend eating at our establishments bc there will be cross contamination. We thanked them fondly for sharing that info with us! They happily answered all our questions as this was our first time. Small talk as well made us feel right at home. Thank you! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been going to rosarios since I was in middle school (like 7+ yrs). It is local, fresh, and delicious NY style pizza"}
{"text":"Thanks for posting such good reviews for this eatery. We stopped on our way through NC and it was wonderful. Salad and veggie pizza was great. Not greasy like other places. Staff very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Why go to a chain when  you can go to Rosario's? I don't know if they deliver because I always pick up. No mater how good the pizza it takes forever to get to my house and is cold. I have never requested delivery here but this is from past experience. The Cslzones are also excellent. Crispy on the outside, sofybon the inside. Yum. Salads, stromboli, cheesecake all excellent! We go often."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza place in the immediate area. It's convenient for any student that goes to Rowan Cabarrus C.C. South campus. Located just once exit south from there off I-85."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Rosario's because of their pizza, pasta and the owner Giovanni is a awesome guy. My daughter loves their pasta dishes but swears the chicken Alfredo  and white pizza are the best. You can't go wrong  if your looking to take your family out  for original NY-style pie.  

Rosario is also great at making deliveries to local businesses in the Poplar Tent area. That's how I first go introduced to Giovanni and Rosario's food. They take care of their customers the right way with excellent service and delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Another place that everyone knows is great it's crowded but they move fast the people work hard and as fast as possible and still have great quality they deserve a raise lol many different kinds of pizzas  and toppings  most  slices are ready to go the other food is also great just had the Hawaiian  great! Do yourself a favor GO"}
{"text":"We go to Rosario's at least once a week.  We have lived in Concord for 20 years and we have tried every pizza joint in town and even ventured out into Charlotte to find the best pizza and this is hands down the best pizza in the area.  The pasta dishes are also excellent and  HUGE, it  can be shared for at least 2 people and have leftovers.  Prices are great and the staff is always friendly.  If you LOVE New York style pizza and Fantastic pasta you gotta go there.    Oh, and i tried the Cheese Steak Hoagie the other day and it was large and so tasty!!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love Rosario's. I grew up in NJ and always assumed everyone had places like this. It wasn't until I moved south in the early 90's that I realized what a great thing a local pizza place is. This is a legitimate NY/NJ pizza place. Everything is as it should be. Slice pies ready to go for lunch, white pizza, calzones, strombolis, hoagies, cheesesteaks, zeppoles and an honest to god sicilian running the place."}
{"text":"NY style pizza at its best.... the real deal.  We have been going there for over 4 years and have never been disappointed.   Not fancy, not high class, just real good pizza.   We get Greek salads with their house dressing too, which is excellent.    Family owned from NY.   If you know what NY style means and crave it... this is a must-visit place.  Can't comment on other menu items but suspect they're good too."}
{"text":"Food:  I am from NY, and this is authentic New York Pizza.  It is delicious, the crust is amazing, the amount of cheese is just right, and the pizza reheats extremely well.  They have a good selection of Italian desserts.  Cannoli's, generous slices of Cheesecake.  They also have those yummy Italian Ices.  

Service: They do offer delivery, but I usually call my pie in and pick it up.  It's always ready EXACTLY on time, and they honor all specials and coupons.  The staff is friendly and the owner is good with faces or either he treats everyone like he knows them.  Either way, YAY!

Prices: They offer single slices so you don't have to commit to an entire pie.  They have an early week special.  Either Monday or Tuesday you can get a few dollars off a large pie.  I'd eat there more if the prices were more competitive.  

Ambience:  This is a very family friendly, casual place.  I see a lot of people gathering here with lots of children, so if you're looking for an out of the way quiet \"restaurant,\" this is not it.  The tables, floor and bathroom is always kept clean.  There is always plenty of parking in a well lit parking lot."}
{"text":"Just got a pick up order from here and I'm curious to know why my pizza has two shades?  Oh wait I've been in the business awhile so I'll let you know... it's because was was cooked before the other... because this place does pizza by the slice... so I can imagine they had half my order already made with a lot of pepperoni on one half and one made to order with barely any on the other half. Def not going back. I'll just get Harris teeter's pizza or marco's across the street. Don't do the ranch dressing either it's not worth the extra dollar. I'm disappointed because my husband likes this place but I see why I stayed clear. #notNewyork #lowballers"}
{"text":"I came here due to my bae living right around the corner. They are in the plaza with Food Lion. 

We came seeking single slices to try the most toppings we could. Service was okay, the cashier seemed like she didn't want to be there but I won't take it personal. The owner or possibly the manager, was hospitable though. We chose to take it to go and it didn't take long... no more than 10 minutes. 

I got the white pizza and the pepperoni. The bae got supreme and pepperoni/sausage. We tore the pizza up! It was pretty good. I don't know what NY pizza tastes like so I can't confirm the authenticity but I liked it. It was definitely filling. The cheese wasn't the freshest but it was better than store bought. 

Also, I didn't see any roaches inside the store. After looking at some other reviews I definitely looked."}
{"text":"I popped in here hoping to pick up a specific Italian pastry. To avoid it showing in search results, I won't name it here as they no longer have these wonderful treats. But that's okay! They have other great stuff!

The counter of pizza-by-the-slice ranges from plain cheese and plain pepperoni to Sicilian, pepperoni and mushroom, eggplant, meat lovers and more. I chose a simple slice of Caprese - sliced mozzarella (not shredded), red peppers, and fresh basil. When the guy brought it to my table a few minutes later, the smell was heavenly. And the taste was better. A *perfect* slice.

Is it New York style? Not quite. But that doesn't make it bad!

Soda fountain or some bottled beverages available. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Being a traveler as an occupation, I have the opportunity to dine in many places.  I spend a lot of time in the NYC area, and occasionally Italy.  Rosario's is the closest to NYC style pizza, if not better.  I occasionally have them special make me an authentic Italian pizza like  you would find along the streets of Rome.  I high recommend the Caprese pizza."}
{"text":"I'm from NYC and this is the closest to NY style pizza I've found since moving here! The caprese slice is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Excellent NY style pizza. Linguini & clam sauce had real clams (not the bits & pieces you get out of a can, plus LOTS of garlic. Cooked to perfection,  no ligering heartburn. Not much on atmosphere but the food is definitely worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"This place is hands down one of the best places in Concord to get great NY style pizza. The manager is friendly and makes you feel like you're eating at his dining room table. He takes pride in his service and food. It's with a heavy heart that I can only rate this restaurant with two stars. My co-workers discovered this spot while on lunch break about three weeks ago. They fell in love with the food and service. So I decided to check it out last week and I also loved it. However today we went there to have lunch and was saddened that the manager wasn't there to greet us with his original Sicilian accented \"Hello, welcome to Rosario.\" The guys there today pretty much just asked us what we wanted to eat. To top it off when my co-workers went to get their drinks they were greeted by a roach which was crawling all over the machine . Without making a scene we told the guy at the register and he immediately came around and pick it up with a napkin and wiped down the machine and said \"sorry.\" We should've ran for the hills but sat down quietly and ate our food trying not to think about we just saw. One of my coworkers mentioned it another guy that worked behind the counter he seemed concerned for about 30 seconds. He huddle with two others guys and whispered something and that was it. No one came over to offer a sincere apology or even acknowledge us anymore until we finished our food and left. I personally will never eat at this restaurant again. It's such a waste the food is delicious and the manager/ owner is SO hospitable but I can't even begin to think where else has that roach or other bugs have traveled in that place."}
{"text":"Not the cheapest place to buy a pizza pie but one of, if not THE best in the area. Excellent pies here as well as other Italian dishes."}
