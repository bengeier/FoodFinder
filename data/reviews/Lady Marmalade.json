{"text":"Really liked it, cool decor, good food, it was busy but that the curse of being great. 
Probably would have loved it but the hype was so huge from everyone who talked about it, living up to the expectation was going to be tough."}
{"text":"Terrible table management. The girl in the striped shirt seated 2 couples who have been waiting in line for 20 mins while our group has waited for 45 mins, when she could have pushed tables together to fit for a large group. This place isn't great for large groups of 6 or more.

But the food smells amazing. Please teach your staff how to seat your customers."}
{"text":"Incredible food, music, decor and service!

Couldn't make a decision on the menu because it all looks so good. Very flexible options as well (gluten free). 

I had the jerk chicken and mango salsa eggs benny special. Loved it! Will definitely try the huervo rancheros next time. 

Heads up: 
1/ This place is busy (!) so you'll likely have to wait before being seated. Staff kindly get you coffee or water while in line, so it makes it better. 
2/ If you don't like eating your food with beats playing, then you might not appreciate the experience. If you do, you'll love it."}
{"text":"It was my first time there with family for brunch on Sunday.The place was small and because we were 6 we should have waited about half an hour in the lane outside.
There is only 2 or 3 table for 6 people and the waitress told us as soon as she saw all of us she would give us a table.because of coldness my mother waited in the car but because of the waitress she had to come and stay in lane!
The food was really tasty,big potion and it was fantastic.
It was worth to wait in lane for long time except for my mom in the cold!
They just accept cash and there is no rule for separated bills!
Overall i would like to go there again but in small group max 4 people.
and as it locates in downtown there is a big problem for parking."}
{"text":"This place is regarded as one of the best brunch places in toronto according to blogto. My first attempt was unsuccessful. Lineup was way too long so I decided to go elsewhere. My second attempt was a success. Did it live up to the expectations? Yes. 

We ordered the wild Pacific salmon sandwich, great flavors with the mango salsa. A bit sweet for my likings but my partner enjoyed it. The nice spicy kick added an extra dimension to the sandwich. 

I ordered the la tortita gordita. Apparently according to our nice server it was the unsung hero compared to the chicken club and the salmon sandwich. After its arrival, It was definitely one of the tastiest sandwiches I've had in a long time. The ham with the avocado, cheese and the pico De Gallo went so well together and the jalape√±o was such a nice touch. I inhaled it within minutes. 

We were both happy with the food and service and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent place for Sunday brunch. Get there early though, to avoid the line-up at the door. We had the Lady Marmalade eggs benedict with mango salsa,  cheese and bacon (which was cooked to perfection), the peanut butter and banana smoothie was light and refreshing and I could not get enough of the freshly squeezed orange juice. The service was fast, friendly and awesome. Definitely worth the trek across town."}
{"text":"Lady marmalade has been my favorite brunch spot for years and I always ordered the same delicious breakfast: the roasted vegetable Benny! 

It was so flavorful especially with the roasted beets that added just the right touch of sweetness. Sadly, I went in for lunch today  and it seems they've changed their menu and this dish specifically, replacing the actual roasted veggies with a \"meh\" pre made paste. 

L.M. If you're reading this pls change back my fave dish!! I don't know if the lines will be worth braving anymore..."}
{"text":"I'm not usually found in this hood but I was lucky enough to stop by Lady Marmalade for a bite with a close friend of mine who lived in the area. He recommended it to me and told me that it's apparently the best breakfast restaurant in the neighborhood and you can obviously tell by the long lines ups during brunch hours. 

Soooo , what can I say about this place? RETRO comes to mind with  a twist of 60's decor but it definetly adds personality to the place. Food is good. Quality of ingredients is fresh and everything is home-made with a touch of tender, love and care. They serve up your regular breakfast dishes from scrambled eggs w/ sausages, bacon, ham etc to omelettes and eggs benedicts. But what stood out to me and was the highlight of my meal was their Baked French Toast! It is so BOMB! Major orgasm in your mouth - the bread is so moist when you bite into it and the flavour is so amazing with a hint of tang from their fruity flavoured syrup that you have a variety to choose from (orange, vanilla rasberry etc). So goooood! 

Everything was excellent! Their prices are reasonable, service was prompt and staff was super friendly. I would love to stop by again.... for their french toast.. *drool"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and I have to say 'meh'! The food is OK, portions are a bit excessive. Coffee is poor. I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about and why there seems to be an eternal line outside this place on weekends - there are much better places - try County General or venture over to the West Side. Definitely not worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Well, 3.5 stars.  The food was delicious. The mango, cheddar and mango eggs benny I had was awesome and the food wasn't overly salted but wasn't lacking in flavour.  I would go back if I was in the area, but I'm a west-end girl, so it might take a bit of effort.  The wait was manageable, though it was odd that they offered the group of three a two-top, then skipped over our group of three to a duo and offered them a table.  Luckily, one of my companions spoke up and we were seated promptly at a two-top with a smile.  The service was good.  However, it was odd that the menu indicated that the meal one of my companions ordered could have a substitution, but didn't indicate that the substitution cost $1.00, not a big deal, but it just sort of felt off."}
{"text":"Their menu is very creative and good portion.
Well done presentation.
But I don't like cash only with long line up.
Seems like must try kind of place but music was like club  and uncomfortable chairs.
Great food but not for that 45mins wait."}
{"text":"Wow! Totally worth the wait!!! My mom, sister and I waited patiently outside in the line for about 10-15 mins, and I am so glad we did. We got a great seat by the front window, our waitress was super and the food was amazing. I had the standard breakfast with bacon, and my mom and sister tried two different eggs beni. The special eggs beni with smoked salmon was one of the best things I've ever tasted!! I wish they made that a staple dish. The coffee was excellent, so were the fresh squeezed juices. I can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"I love the roasted vegetable Benny served on a toasted english muffin with sharp white cheddar, alongside a mixed green salad with a delicious miso dressing. Potato hash browns are usually undercooked but everything is so good that this can be overlooked. Ginger tea should not be missed on cold winters days."}
{"text":"Came here this morning at 9am for breakfast.  Lady Marmalade exceeded our expectations.  First off, the coffee was delicious and strong(!), definitely cafe quality, not the usual watered-down diner stuff.  They had 4 choices for freshly squeezed juices, we opted for the apple juice for my daughter. We ordered eggs benny and huevos migas as our mains.  Both were cooked perfectly and delicious. The salsa verde which they had in the tiny little squeeze bottle was AMAZING.

I would like to address people who downgrade restaurants for being \"pricey\".  Lady Marmalade uses organic ingredients when possible and the cooked our dishes perfectly.  For about $13, it was a total bargain in my eyes. Consider other things along with the price before you write a review."}
{"text":"This might just be the best brunch I've ever had. Huevos Migas. It was perfect."}
{"text":"5 Stars on the food...very good breakfast so it gets the top score!

I would love to rate this place lower but I can't because there's really no point. This place will become irrelevant on it's own when a trendier, more hipster-ish place opens up a few blocks away from it. Either way I would suggest the following:

Breakfast for 2 shouldn't cost over 40-50$ - you are selling eggs, greens and bread.

You shouldn't have to dress like a trendy hipster-douche for breakfast

This would be considered a painfully average place in a city like MTL or NYC

Stop TRYING SO HARD to be cool...from your staff to your salt shakers

Stop offering cash only and skimping on declared sales to revenue Canada - that wouldn't be an issue for me if you charged a reasonable price for EGGS and TOAST.

Owner seems a bit pretentious and definitely overconfident in his prices. Please be aware that this is a breakfast and sandwich spot. 

Oh the potatoes are never cooked well but that's ok really... they look good in the background when each patron of yours is busy instagramming or tweeting their funky salt shakers."}
{"text":"Worth the wait!! The food is fantastic! Great service. The coffee is from te amo down the street and it's soooo good!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing food. There was about half hr wait when we got there around 1pm, but sooo worth it!! I had the crepe croque Monsieur and the  bread pudding daily special, strawberry chocolate coconut. It was all super delicious. My frie go the Moroccan omelette dish, which was really good and flavourful...but after a few mouthfuls, the flavour was too much. But it was all very yummy in the tummy! Would def go back"}
{"text":"This place has the look of what you would expect to find at the home of a hipster situated with his sweet old grandma - homey and warm, yet still refreshing (I wasn't really trying to bash it, I swear).          
     Lady Marmalade is a great place for brunch if you don't mind the long lines. I've only been here twice but that's often enough to learn how quickly this place fills up. At 8:30am, half an hour after opening, this place is already almost completely packed. The menu is comprised of a nice mix of classic options with fun, creative, and modern twists that all sound really good! The prices are also pretty reasonable, as are the portions; nothing huge, but the dishes don't leave you hungry either. 
     As for the actual food, all I can say is that this place really needs to work on the quality control.The eggs Benedict with the pulled pork was delicious!! However, on my second visit, I ordered the eggs Benny with brie, avocado, and bacon - kind of a disappointment. The eggs were over poached, the potatoes were slightly underdone, and the side salad was dry. But this place made a such a great first impression on me, I'll definitely be going back to go back to try some of its other dishes. 

Also, for some reason, it seems that only one of the two washrooms has a door that can lock."}
{"text":"I would definitely return. My boyfriend and I waited about a half an hour, but it was a pleasant wait despite the cold. The decor is adorable! Our waitress was pretty attentive to our table and our food came in a timely manner. I had the brie, avocado, and bacon \"benny\". it was simply delicious. The bf had apple cinnamon french toast and loved it. the place is very busy so it probably isn't the place for you if you want a quiet and leisurely meal."}
{"text":"The best eggs benefit everrr!!!

Good service and I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the lineup and the general atmosphere ( which was cute at the same time)

We also tried the huevos frittos that came with tortillas and it was ok but the Benedict was something else (I tried the tomato pesto one and it was really light and refreshing) 

Prices: decent for the portions but you can easily finish one order by yourself!!! They are GOOD"}
{"text":"This place never fails me!  They have wicked brunches and there's always a line up! But don't let the line up turn you down as it goes pretty quickly.  Their mexican twist to some of the traditional brunch items are superb!  Highly recommend this place.  This is THE place for brunch in Toronto.  A must try!"}
{"text":"YUM!
Went out for brunch on a holiday Monday and took some friends as well as my mom. Everyone LOVED their food. The eggs benedict were really good...the hollindaise sauce was to die for.

The spinach and cheddar waffles were YUMMY. Oh my goodness. That is my top recommendation from what we had.

My mom who was very picky enjoyed her food as well.

Atmosphere is very loud so if your looking for a nice, quiet breakfast, DONT come here.

Other than that, really good inventive food, good coffee, and nice people."}
{"text":"You know a place it's good when you find 20 people lining outside trying to get a table.
You can't reserve a table so I reccomend showing up as early as possible. As for the food. It is from another world, This cool spot in Leslieville really takes eating well to a new different level.
You will find everything on their menu interesting and tasty.
It is a bit noisy but still you can meet up with friends for brunch or your kids for breakfast. Highly reccomend you to stop by during the week, so you can at enjoy your meal without waiting. Overall just an excellent place and one of my favourites."}
{"text":"Judging by the other reviews, I've been missing out on the eggs benny. 

However, the dish that I always order when I go to Lady Marmalade is the Brown Rice Bowl, \"Baja Style\" topped with black beans, aged white cheddar, pico de gallo salsa, avocado, sour cream, scallions, & cilantro. Inevitably, someone orders the Baja bowl when we go. Sometimes more than one someone. A really wonderful mix of texture and taste. For me, it's the cilantro that makes this dish, so don't push it off to the side. A great filling meal that just happens to also be vegetarian. 

The Real Club Sandwich consists of bacon, chicken, avocado, tomato, red onions, & chipotle mayo. Really quite tasty. Good mix of flavours and a tasty hit from the mayo. Sometimes, I split a sandwich and the Baja bowl with someone. That way I can have both.

With the mishmash of mismatched chairs, melamine tables, and kitschy shakers, you can't help but feel that you've sat down in someone's kitchen. From the 70s. All entirely apropos for the kind of comfort food served to packed tables and a waiting line.

(Check the blog for accompanying photos and menus)"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite brunch spot in Toronto.

Oddly enough, I hadn't considered having a sandwich as my main brunch item. That was until I came to this restaurant.
I've been to Lady Marmalade twice, and both times I had the most delicious sandwiches. Their \"Cochinita Pibil\" one is as good as it gets.

Their lattes are also very good.

There is one reason why I'm giving them 4 stars and not 5: my girlfriend ordered their breakfast poutine - I tried it, we both were not impressed with it. In fact, I would advise against having that item. It isn't a poutine. It's just home fries with hollandaise sauce (Miso gravy for poutine didn't sound like a good idea) and the cheese used wasn't the best choice for this. Homefries simply do not work when it comes to poutine. At least not for us, that love the real deal.

With that out of the way, the menu is exciting. Everything else we've had has been delicious, and their menu has left us intrigued enough to actually want to go back and try more stuff."}
{"text":"Went to Lady Marmalade for my third time this morning.  It's pretty good and of a high quality, but there is an emphasis on Mexican style dishes, which is fine if you like black or brown beans (I do not).  As such, there is a lack of options to get excited about for me.  I had the crepe croque monsiuer this morning, which was very good.   

Service is pretty good, but nothing special.  Also the prices are certainly on the the higher end.  I prefer Bonjour Brioche personally, which I think offers more food diversity and better prices. 

The start of the brunch was a bit odd this morning as at 10 am the server rattled off about 5 dishes on the menu that they were out of.

Bring cash because they don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"I had some awesome huevos migas here a few weeks ago. I was there with two friends -- one had what she described as the best eggs benedict she's ever had, while the other got your basic eggs and toast and was pretty disappointed. It seems like the fancier you go here, the better the result will be.

Tons of gluten-free options!"}
{"text":"OMG I finally had a chance to visit the newly opened Lady Marmalade.  I'm happy to report that I was pleasantly impressed and the place lived up to all they hype I've been hearing from west coast peeps who have eaten at the original location in Victoria.

The place is very eclectic and welcoming.  The staff were very friendly and services was pretty good considering the place has only been open about a week and has been way busier than they ever expected.  Unfortunately, today was another busy day and they ran out of food an hour before closing and had to turn some people away.  I say this is a good sign though, since I would rather be running out of food due to popularity, rather than having no one interested in my new restaurant.

I ended up settling on a veggie poached BLT masterpiece.  Instead of bacon they swapped in some avocado.  The flavors were amazing and multi-layered.  My eggs were a little over done, but even without a nice runny inside the meal was still amazing.   Beyond breakfast they had a ton of other items I will definitely try on future visits - curries, sandwiches, etc.

This place is destine to become one of my new local favourites.  Hope they can keep up with their popularity."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The service is amazing. The decor is amazing. 

Only complaint is the long line ups because they're so popular, and that they don't take credit cards.

But I would wait in line anytime for their Eggs Benny. Yum."}
{"text":"The avocado bacon Brie benny is the bomb. Eggs cooked to perfection. Hubby enjoyed his Huervos Rancheros breakfast. Staff are friendly. Atmosphere is a little dingy, walls could use a cleaning/paint job. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Was the first brunch place I checked out after I moved to the 'hood. Staff was nice. Vibe was ok but music was way too loud - probably to drain out the noise of suburban girl friends talking about office politics. Food : i had their version of huevos rancheros and they were pretty boring and the beans way undercooked  my roomie also Mentioned the same thing when shed been there another time  I'd come back here again just because the food was so unmemorable Im curious if other menu items could be good."}
{"text":"Honestly, I have had better brunch than this place.  Food is 6/10 but the service is bad. I get that they are busy but the service is terrible. The waiter was like I ain't got time for u guys. Basically probably little bit better than a pizza delivery guy trying to collect the debt from you."}
{"text":"Delicious food and would visit again despite the long line up and the inconvenience of cash only.

I ordered the pulled pork & red onions eggs bennie and my bf ordered the huevos migas. both were delicious and the price and portion sizes were fair."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch, although we had to wait for an hour in the cold to get a table. Eggs Benedict was good, and so was the Mexican inspired egg dish (can't remember the name now). Will be back."}
{"text":"I've been back to Lady Marmalade twice in the last three weeks and it's only gotten better. I've been on an Eggs Benny kick and have tried their brie/avocado eggs benny and their mango/cheddar cheese eggs benny. They were both *spectacularly* good; so good, in fact, that I may or may not have been able to put my face in the dish. Their lattes are fantastic, too.

The service is great -- the servers are friendly and helpful even though they are usually funning around like chickens with their heads cut off.

NOTE: LM is CASH ONLY which slightly annoys me, but the food is far too good to squabble over that detail. Just go prepared."}
{"text":"So I have been living under a rock and have not heard of all this hype about Lady Marmalade. In my mind, I was just in a comfy restaurant catching up with a friend over Saturday brunch. Apparently there was a 40 minute wait for seats which I missed because I arrived late. Yes, I'm a terrible friend but that also means I experienced Lady Marmalade at its best... no lines!

I ordered the beet, carrot, apple and ginger juice to start. It was sweeter than I expected but the 'healthy goodness' of it felt like I just fed my stomach a vegetable patch. Following this wise choice, I went for the scrambled tofu which came with home fries and a salad. The proportion was big and everything tasted fresh and flavourful. I have never had scrambled tofu before so I don't have other comparisons. I did manage to sneak some of my friend's huevos rancheritos and it was delicious! Also, a shout out to the bread that was on my plate- it was very good bread. The service was very friendly and quick so that is worth a mention. 

Overall, I enjoyed my experience but I don't know if I would now go home and build a shrine for the restaurant. You will leave happy if you go to  Lady Marmalade to simply enjoy the food and the company of your loved ones- forget about expectations."}
{"text":"Favorite in the city for breakfast. Expect a line. Friendly staff, pilot coffee, great huevos rancheritos."}
{"text":"Came to Lady Marmalade on a hot Monday afternoon at around 1:30. Unfortunately they didn't have AC and the fans were just blowing around hot air... so I was hoping the food would would be worth it. 

I started with the fresh raspberry apple juice ($3.75). It was sweet and tart, and although it was decent, it wasn't really for me. I should've just stuck to the regular OJ. My friend had the homemade lemonade ($2.75) which was really tasty and refreshing.

We shared the huevos migas - 3 soft-scrambled eggs w/ cheese, tomatoes, scallions & spicy sausage, served w/ basmati brown rice n' beans, sourcream, organic corn tortilla chips & pico de gallo salsa ($11.5). The eggs were perfectly scrambled and tasted pretty damn good with all the other ingredients. However, I wasn't a huge fan of the rice or the beans (but I don't like beans so that probably isn't saying much). 

We also ordered one of the egg benny's - the one with ham, red onion and chipotle mayo for $11.50. The hollandaise, which I think makes or breaks an eggs benny, was fantastic. I couldn't really taste the chipotle mayo, but I didn't really care since the hollandaise had such a great flavour. Overall, a great dish!

All bennies are served with potatoes and a salad or fresh tomatoes with lemony hollandaise. We opted for the potatoes and salad. The salad reminded me of the kind you get at Japanese restaurants as it had an asian dressing. The salad wasn't anything special, but I don't come to brunch for a side salad, so they're forgiven. As for the potatoes, they were pretty enjoyable - crispy bite-sized morsels.

Anyways, like a lot of other brunch spots around the city, the decor and furnishings consisted of mismatched furniture and dishes. Also keep in mind they take cash only. Overall, a solid brunch spot."}
{"text":"Loved this spot. Arrived early which was good planning because a line formed soon after we arrived. Ordered the brie and bacon eggs benny which was fantastic! Would come back to this spot to try other menu items, really nice selection of options."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Lady Marmalade. Came with my family for brunch one Sunday and waited in line for a little over an hour. The decor inside was very cute. 

All of our meals were mediocre, if not a little worse. I got \"The 2 Eggs\" and my mother and sister got the eggs benedict. Wasn't impressed with the margarine used on my toast (not butter), the potatoes lacked flavour and the potatoes had a spice on it that I didn't enjoy (paprika?). 

Unfortunately, we all felt sick when we left. I really don't understand why they are so popular... perhaps other dishes are better? Can't say we'll be returning."}
{"text":"The restaurant had a lot of character. A perfect place for a Sunday brunch

Bacon Avocado Brie is now my new favorite Benny! Lite and tasty hollandaise sauce with an egg poached to perfection

Service was outstanding! The servers refilled our coffee frequently and was very attentive"}
{"text":"Nice brunch spot in the area.
But I found that food is nothing special. 
Not worth to wait and cost."}
{"text":"Breakfast sets the tone for the day. Especially when having it at lady marmalade, you'll be thinking it all day and days after. It's been a month and I still think of the eggs Benedict with avocado, bacon, and Brie with that perfect hollandaise sauce that wraps everything up for a taste buds gallore. Love their fresh apple ginger beet juice to clean the palate afterwards. Be prepared for a line up or go after 2 if you don't wanna wait. Cash only or there's a TD  bank right next door."}
{"text":"So, after months of trying to get in, finally happened today. I've got to experience most of leslieville's brunch offerings after trying to get in to Lady Marmalade, and the GF tapping out of the line due to a 45 min plus wait.  there's alot of hype, and i have to say, it didnt quite measure up. not any fault of the place, as its lovely, but maybe just the fault of all the friends who swear by it. 

Went for a late brunch with my girlfriends sisters boyfriend, as the girls were out of town, and we are pathetic without them.  he had a gift certificate someone gave him that expired this week, so we said \"tally ho\" We met at 1pm, and got really lucky and only waited 15 minutes.  

The atmosphere and vibe is perfect, and we only felt a little out of place being ina very coupl-y environment, but, well i dont think anyone noticed as we could pass for a pretty cute couple, in fact, i know we did. service was quick, super friendly and very good in general.

the menu has alot of great veggie friendly and healthy options, which would be great if that appealed to me.  what i was craving was meat, gravy, eggs, cheese, and potatoes, as i had alot of beer and whiskey to clear out from saturday night. I had heard great things about their poutine, and was crazy jazzed to try it, hopefully with poached eggs on top( if you have not had poutine with poached eggs, run dont walk)

 but guess what? they dont do it on the weekend. WTF! so I licked my wounds, and decided that i wouldn't pout. 

my \"date\" had the most enormous mexican egg and rice dish, and loved it.  i was fairly reserved, and went for a baked croque monsieur crepe, which was average at best.  i think its not a good picture of how good the food is, but well, i wanted a close proximity to what i had in mind. 

the smoothies we started with were exceptional, and, even thought the line was out the door and around, servers were really laid back and we didnt feel rushed. 

lets just go back to the poutine thing. I cant for my life understand why they wouldnt do this on the weekend. its an easy dish to prep and sell, and it would sell like those red butt flap flannel pyjamas in whitehorse. just saying. 

i'll give it another shot, as i think next time i will go with my GF and be compelled to eat a more balanced diet, not the caveman approach."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!!  My friend and I went here today for brunch.  The place was crowded and I was worried after the long line up at the door that the service would be slow.  But I was wrong.  The food was excellent and served promptly by very friendly staff.  Will definitely be coming back:)"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and tried this place when it first opened and was pretty excited.  Its not the same as it was. 

I went this past weekend, see there wasn't a large line outside but there was a little one inside.  I was pretty disappointed after speaking with the host.  I'd asked how long it would take to get a seat for two and wasn't given a number, i got a shrug.  I then asked for more information, like how far down the line I was etc.  And she responded with, \"Don't tell me how to do my job\".  Maybe she felt offended that I asked questions but I don't believe warranted that response.

i left and went over to lil baci - no lines and awesome service

I will not go back"}
{"text":"I had read there would be a line, so I came prepared to wait. I think we only waited about 15-20 minutes IN THE RAIN and I don't even care because it was totally worth it.

My friend had the eggs benny, and I ordered spinach and cheddar waffles. WAFFLES. WITH BACON. Seriously, it was absolutely incredible. I would give it 5 stars, but the coffee was sorta meh.

Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 10:30am and was seated by 11am, but Lady Marmalade was certainly worth the wait. The Eggs Benny with avocado, brie and bacon was spectacular. It came with a side of chunky homefries and a salad/coleslaw in a tangy asian dressing of some sort - unique alternative to the usual fruit. The friendly and attentive staff made sure my coffee was always topped up. By the time I left (noonish?) the lineup outside was certainly an hour (or more) long, but people didn't seem to mind."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Trendy, happening, great music.  Everything is good here.  I had a benne with bacon and avocado.  Fabulous!   My waiter was cute too!  Cut off jean shorts and bright t shirt.  Bubbling with fabulousness!"}
{"text":"Has to be one of my favourite spots. This is one of those places where the line is worth it, and the hype is founded on their delicious perfectly runny poached eggs."}
{"text":"I love Lady Marmalade and would go here for brunch every weekend if it were not for the constant line up - even at 10 AM on a Friday! I try to go here when I have days off to avoid the crowd, but I'm amazed at how many people are there during the week. Brunch is very fresh and not your typical bacon and eggs. There is plenty to choose from. Service is fast and friendly as well. I did not give this place 5 stars because i never feel compelled to wait in line - I imagine only a 5+ star place would make me want to do that."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's really cute, super tasty & they use free run eggs. Fantastic selection of bennies! Be there early or be prepared to wait for a while. They won't seat you until your entire party has arrived, which is fair, given how busy this place gets. Cash only."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been awesome. From the bennies to the baked french toast, they really know how to put together a solid brunch plate. And the breakfast poutine with miso gravy is interesting and delicious too, when available. The side salad that comes with many of the dishes is a highlight, too.

There is almost always a wait, and it sucks. But that's to be expected at a brunch spot this popular. However, the Leslieville stroller mafia makes a long wait even more annoying by insisting on piling their strollers up in the limited waiting space. Even more annoying is when one of them insists on a four-top for their party of two adults so they can park the damn thing right up at the table, with no thought to the larger groups waiting patiently in line.

Anyway. A soft egg yolk and some delicious roasted vegetables is all it takes to make those annoyances fade away, and thankfully Lady Marmalade has that well covered. But maybe they could gently suggest that the strollers be left outside..."}
{"text":"I went to this well talked about place after i saw a picture of the french toast that a friend of mine posted on facebook.  

We went on a Sunday afternoon prime time brunch. As we got there, there seemed to already be a queue of people waiting.  We decided to stand in line as it appeared that the wait could be within half an hour.

Lucky for us, after 20 minutes, we were able to get a table for two. Unfortunately, we went on a hot summer day and the place was devoid of any air conditioning. To solve that problem, i immediately ordered their fresh squeezed lemonade to quench my thirst and to cool off.

As i perused the menu, there was a multitude of selections.  Everything looked good as i looked up to see what the people at the other tables were having.  I zeroed in on the poached eggs with bacon and potatoes & side salad/toast.  When the food arrived, i was not disappointed. Everything tasted fresh, the bacon was premium bacon, and the eggs/potato and toast were amazing. Although i was disappointed i could not have a taste of the french toast as well, i was very satisfied with my order.

Overall, the ambiance was good, the price was reasonable (approx. $15 per person).  The quality of the food was good, the service was reasonable (no overly attentive wait staff such as a 5 star fine dining and given how busy they are but adequate when you compare it to Chinatown). I would definitely recommend this place and would go back.  For the people that expect diner style portions and food, this probably isn't the place for you.  You get quality over quantity here...but who needs anything more?"}
{"text":"Been there a few times and don't really understand and after the last time I don't really care to understand. Living in the neighbourhood I see and wonder as friends say what a great place this is to meet and have brunch.

The food... Hard dry bread fit only to be a trencher at some place like Medieval Times...  poached eggs or is there another choice???... over spiced potatoes... 
grim avocados should have been tossed days ago.

Decor of recovered trailer trash from the last hurricane... Grungy plywood floors... no real accommodation made for any kind of client comfort... The concept is dated and in the wrong area of the country to be meaningful. I simply do not find sitting in a broken down discarded old chair not being able to touch anything more real that particle board an experience worth seeking and or paying money for.

Staff of tweekers and dizzy blonds... I have eaten here four times only because I had to... the orders are never correct and there is never anything but a vacuous glazed wondering... The time for service is seriously flawed and why anyone would wait in a line of vacant iphone tapping disconnected 30 somethings... oh yeah I could never fit because I am a little older and little more connected to reality.

Why bother when you can get real food at any number of great, friendly and client friendly establishments within steps of this terrible place."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place having read great reviews, but I can't say I was that impressed. My husband and I each ordered an eggs Benny meal. I wouldn't call myself an eggs Benny expert but it is my go to dish each time I visit a brunch place. I wasn't impressed with my Benny. When I first cut it to it, some water came out of my poached egg. The taste was average as well. We also ordered the bread pudding. It was very hard, I had a hard time trying to cut it with my knife. So in my opinion, the place is bit over rated."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and although it always has a line up it's really not worth it. Gave it a few chances to see if perhaps it was just an \"off\" day for their staff but three times is enough to draw a line and it simply isn't worth it. 
1) The staff seem less than happy to be there- they're harried, impatient with questions, and dismissive. The third time I was there, we sat for 10 minutes waiting to get their attention just to get a menu. 
2) I have an allergy and got extremely ill the third time I was there due to a contamination- the server didn't seem to care or actually look in to whether the kitchen could make a dish modification. My guess is they weren't able to. 
3) There are so many other good restaurants in the area that it really isn't worth waiting an hour in any sort of weather for overpriced eggs and bacon. 
I want to love it because it's local to me but I really can't be bothered to give it another shot."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place and have been attending for years, introducing my friends and family from out of town, always showing my love, appreciation, and support. I've loved how accommodating, enthusiastic, and homey this place is, as are their employees. However, this morning was a curveball I would've never expected.

I just had possibly the worst interaction I've ever had over the phone with one of their staff members in regards to a potential visit. I would never speak to someone like that, nor would I ever dismiss a potential customers' questions or visits. This person was very cold over the phone, did not answer my questions, and hung up on me. How completely rude and uncalled for. Is this how they treat their clientele? Am I just blind to it because the food is so delicious?

Regardless of such deliciousness, I really don't think I'll be bringing myself to this place any time soon, nor introducing anyone again if such attitude persists. Thanks, but no thanks!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here a few months ago, and I've been meaning to write a review...cuz we're still talking about it.
DH is a creature of habit, and likes his regular spots...which we already have, for breakfast.  So after months of driving by, seeing the line up and commenting, \"We gotta try LM\", he finally conceeded to my plea...and he hasn't forgotten the open-faced BLT he had since.   As for my Huevos Migas, DH described it perfectly - \"It's like a party in your mouth.\"  Service is great and very accomodating particularly to families with infants/strollers and small children, as we brought our toddler and they customized an order for him.  We'll definitely be back, and it seems the key to beating the line, is arriving before 9:30."}
{"text":"I've been to a handful of brunch spots in Toronto, and this is definitely one of my favourites!!!

I ordered the eggs benny with Brie, bacon and avocado. Was super impressed with how good it tasted.

Service wasn't the best, but it was also very busy that day so I don't expect it to be 100. 

The wait time to get in was also a little longer than desired (roughly 25 minutes) but then again, a lot of brunch places have long lines up as well.

Would 10/10 recommend this place to someone else."}
{"text":"This place was so worth the wait. It's small and it can get very busy on weekends so go early. 
Had the Avacado Eggs Benny with bacon and Brie it was amazing. One of the best Benny's I've had. They also have a cheddar, bacon and mango salsa benny which id love to try. Breakfast potatoes were great. Another person in our party had the AM poutine and said it was so good. Also from our party reviews on the scrambled eggs were really great and fluffy. Definitely would go again."}
{"text":"Benny's as great as expectations. And they have sweet London Fog and Hot Chocolate to warm your heart. The best part came from the salmon, crispy and spicy, which I've never imagined to have at a brunch place. They have me."}
{"text":"The food here is decent, but I would skip it for the plethora of other great brunch places in Toronto if you're looking for anything above subpar service and polite waitstaff."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the fact that others raved about this place before I had a chance to try it, but my expectations might have been a bit high for this spot.

We arrived mid afternoon on a weekday.  The table we sat at was a bit busted and we waited for a bit for someone to take our order.  When she did come, I hadn't looked at the menu very carefully.  Assuming it was just another breakfast place, I asked for fried eggs.  The server was a bit rude, I thought, and said \"We don't serve fried eggs.  You can have them poached or scrambled.\"  OK - it's your restaurant, but when you do something unusual like that, don't expect me to know your rules. I'm just a customer.  She suggested that I order poached eggs and they could do them firmer... because that's more like a fried egg?  Anyways, my poached eggs resembled two rubbery golf balls in a little glass dish with a dribble of water in the bottom.  On the side was toast and the mixed greens salad I buy at No Frills.  Not very nice.

My question is this, though... if they only make poached and scrambled eggs, and the eggs arrive in a bowl like that... are they cooking them in a microwave?  Does anyone know?"}
{"text":"Had to wait for an hour on the long weekend Monday for brunch.... But it was worth it..... The eggs bene both the avocado brie and pulled pork one was extremely delicious and came with a generous serving of hollandaise sauce..... We were pretty full but gave into our temptation to have the famous bread pudding.... Thus was extremely soft and flavourful... Perfectly cooked...... I would come back here again....."}
{"text":"Great brunch.  The bennies dishes are great: the hollandaise isn't too heavy but very tasty, the potatoes aren't greasy and the salad that comes with the dish is crisp.  Most of the dishes I've seen here are a bit lighter (not as oily/greasy) as most brunch places. One of my brunch gotos.  Quite busy most of the time, especially on the weekends.  Plan to wait in line a bit."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I had the Brie, Avocado & Bacon Bennie which came with really tasty potatoes and a nice salad. I also had the hot chocolate with marshmallows. The place is small but so popular that we waited on the line outside for a table for 45 min. We arrived at about 12:30 on a Sat and got a table just in time before the heavy snow fell. They do not accept reservations and they only accept CASH.  I would definitely go again if the wait time was less."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly and attractive staff. It can get very busy and waits can be very long. They only take cash, and have no AC in the summer. Still, the best branch in Leslieville."}
{"text":"Line ups seem to form earlier and earlier on weekends...so we took the day off to go today.  One of our fave places for delicious brunch.  Everything on the menu is tasty and well done.  Highly recommend.

Note: cash only; no reservations"}
{"text":"Lady Marmalade is a cute little spot in Leslieville. Why is it that the restaurants truly have to be holes in the wall in order to offer up a great brunch? My guess is because they aren't pretentious like so many of the nicer restaurants who do brunch, where yeah the food is good but unless you spend $30 on eggs, toast, et. al. you walk out still hungry. 

Anyway I digress. Lady Marmalade is a place you are better off getting to early rather than late. We got there at about 10 30 last Saturday and ended up waiting in line for about 30 mins or so. This wasn't really a big deal because the weather was really nice and the company was good. But this would have been a bit of a pain had the weather not been so great because you pretty much have to wait outside the restaurant. 

I had the Huevos Rancheros, which is a typical brunch dish for me. I was really happy with this. My fiancee had the Eggs Benedict with avocado and brie, which she was unwilling to share because it was so good. And our buddy had waffles, but he actually spent more time raving about the bacon than anything else.

So in short, the food was good, the service was friendly and quick, and despite the line we really enjoyed ourselves. I will certainly be going back at some point."}
{"text":"A wonderful place for brunch!

Having walked by Lady Marmalade every weekend for months, I knew what to expect in terms of their line-up outside. I prepared myself for the worst, especially as I visited on a sunny Sunday, so was relatively relieved to be seated and ready to order within twenty minutes.

The menu manages to accommodate all tastes, while still being unique. I loved how all the staple brunch items you'd expect were included on the menu, but many had original twists, e.g: the croque madame I ordered was served not on toasted bread, but within a tasty crepe! 

My meal was incredibly filling and I left feeling STUFFED. This ensured the slightly pricey nature of Lady Marmalade didn't bother me too much. The crepe and accompanying poached eggs were expertly cooked and the ingredients delightfully fresh (and sourced from the local, organic, ethical Rowe Farms across the street).

The filter coffee I ordered was similarly impressive - so often brewed coffee in these type of establishments is a let-down. Not here. The blend was strong and citrusy, served HOT (not lukewarm as is often the case elsewhere), and the refills kept coming without me having to ask!

The service was good, especially considering how busy the place was.

I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"It's OK. Everything is Mexican style. It's not a wow brunch. It was delicious though. 
I'm not sure if it's worth the long lineup. 
They accept just cash and it's not convenient to my mind. There's TD ATM beside the restaurant."}
{"text":"If you don't mind waiting a bit for a table (or better, go early!) Lady Marmalade hits the mark with a delicious lunch and brunch menu.

The variations on standard breakfast fare like baked Snickers bar french toast (which I treated myself to after completing a half marathon - Yummm!) and many versions of eggs Benny make the menu diverse but familiar. 

I would love to see the restaurant expand to accommodate its popularity and demand. The long lines are the only downside to the Lady Marmalade experience, but I still give 5 stars due to the exceptionally delicious fare and friendly and efficient service."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend with some friends because one of them had been raving about it.  We decided to go at 2pm hoping there wouldn't be a line up but there still was....

As we were a group of three we had to wait a bit longer...as per all brunch places.  However, the staff were super nice and noticed a pair of diners who were taking up a 4 seater table and politely asked them if they would be willing to move to an open 2 seater table.  

I tried the pulled pork eggs benny and wasn't too impressed.  Perhaps its because we arrived quite late at the restaurant, the pulled pork I received had some very dry pieces almost reminiscent of pork jerky or perhaps I just got the end pieces... Personally, if the pork is that dry, it shouldn't be served at all.  Further to this, I like my poached eggs to be runny when I cut into it and it was cooked more of a medium texture.  The salad had a miso dressing which was ok and the potatoes were quite tasty.  

My friends had the croque monsieur and the eggs benny with brie, avocado and bacon.   My friend enjoyed her eggs benny more than I did...so perhaps I just ordered the wrong one? 

Just one last comment on the decor...its very...eclectic and hipster.  Nothing against hipster decor but the eclectic furniture was kind of uncomfortable.  On top of that the waitress served us water and gave us plastic cups reminiscent of what you would use as a kid at a camp. Plastic cups are fine but they were all chipped at the top like it was very well used and to be honest it felt kind of dirty drinking out of it. Perhaps they need to change their cups to some nice clean glasses...or does that take away from the hipster feel? I dont know.....

Perhaps I'll try it again but I certainly won't be rushing to come line up for brunch."}
{"text":"Top 10 breakfast places in Toronto and the staff is very sweet too. But the spot is too small and there is almost always a long line up."}
{"text":"After hearing lots of hype about Lady Marmalade's brunch over the past few years, my husband and I finally tried it this past weekend.  Luckily, we were adequately warned about the line ahead of time, and we did wait about 45-60 minutes for a table.   
A good portion of that wait time as outside in the frigid cold - there isn't much room for a line-up inside.

The atmosphere is kitschy/eclectic/casual.  Similar to Mitzi's and many other brunch places in the city.  

I had 2 eggs (only options are poached or scrambled, so I chose poached), with homefries, a salad, and I ordered the sausage as well.  It was all enjoyable and fresh.  I was happy with it and enjoyed it, but was not \"wowed\" by it.   I thought the potatoes were crisped nicely, but also a bit dry/lacking in flavour.   The salad was really nice with a sesame ginger-type dressing.  My husband had eggs benny with avocado and bacon.  He enjoyed his but was underwhelmed (I think he's now mentally comparing everything to Barque's Smokehouse which he LOVED a few weeks ago).  He rates this Eggs Benny below Mitzi's Sister and Beacher Cafe.  

Maybe we were over-hyped, but we just came away sort of wondering what was so spectacular about Lady Marmalade.  Maybe we are just too spoiled by all the great options in the West End?  We both thought the food was nicely prepared, and we would definitely return - however, we won't ever wait in line again.  It just didn't seem worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for brunch. The food was amazing! I have a Benny dish with the mango salsa & ched cheese & bacon & it was just amazing! It was filling too! Worth the money, reasonably priced. The only thing was the latte didn't taste good. I'm not sure how to explain the taste but it wasn't good."}
{"text":"I like this place.
Great food and smoothies; a fantastic combo in my books. 
I think this was visit 4 for me this year and have always been happy to return. 

Come early (read as soon as they open) or be prepared to wait. 
If it is after 9am and you are in a hurry or impatient I would perhaps choose to go elsewhere.  

Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The only place in Leslieville I will line up and wait for. I meant to take a picture of the very yummy Huevos Ranchitos I had today, but I was so excited by the meal that I forgot all about my intentions until the plate had been cleared away. I LOVE this place (especially the fact that they use only free-range (organic if possible) eggs and bread fresh from a local bakery. Locavore heaven!), my only wish was that they had a patio. That would make it perfect."}
{"text":"Great brunch place. Small place and always a line up. Don't go here with a big group, you won't get a spot. Cash only."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't wrote a review for Lady yet!

My first, second, and third visit has been amazing.  Staff are attentive even when the tables are filled and food are always served timely.

Menu has adequate amount of choices and the awesome part is you can't go wrong.  Everything is delicious! Portion is adequate and price is fair.

I would recommend coming in pair to be seated quickly and there's plenty of side street parking during the weekend."}
{"text":"Went there today after reading all the positive Yelp reviews.  It was such a gorgeous, sunny Sunday and waiting in line wasn't so bad.  People in line had Starbucks in hand and we took a cue and got a latte to hold us over.  About 25 min later around 12:40pm we got our table.  It was SOOOO worth the wait.  My boyfriend ordered the  Brie, Avocado and Bacon Benny.  It came with side potatoes and a small salad.
I ordered the Wild Pacific Salmon Sandwich:  It was full of yummy goodness with avocado and a nice big piece of salmon.  We were both pleasantly full after.  With tax and tip it was about $34 for 2 people.
Do take a nice walk after and if you still have room a few doors down, part of the next block going East you have to get some ice-cream or gelato from Ed's Real Scoop.  This place is to die for."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful Saturday morning in Toronto. I met the guys in the east end of the city at a brunch place called Lady Marmalade. Here are the facts:

They don't take reservations
They just seat you when your entire party is present
They are a cash only establishment
But they serve a very nice brunch. Yes, they do

We waited for 30-45 minutes in line. Mostly because we did not come together and some of us were a bit late. Lady Marmalade is known by their bennies and they also have gluten free options in the menu, which is very nice. I was trying to avoid carbs so I ordered the Huevos Rancheritos (scrambled eggs with salsa, refried black beans, guacamole, and a wheat tortilla). I did not eat the tortilla so I was happy with the amount of protein I got in that meal. It may be shocking but I did not eat until 8:30PM after this super heavy brunch. 

The service was very lax and friendly. The decor was bright and cheery. The food was simple and tasty, very good but not outstanding. Nice for a change. I love Leslieville!"}
{"text":"I've been twice for weekend brunch and can't wait to go again!

There is always a line, but the wait is only about 20-30 minutes depending on the size of your party. Besides that, what's not to love about Peanut Butter french toast at 2PM on Sunday with friends? 

I think the menu is creative and different -- certainly a nice change of pace from the usually greasy eggs/bacon-type breakfast which can leave you feeling like you need to be deflated.

Also, prices are very good considering the good portions."}
{"text":"This place lived up to the hype!
Their hollandaise sauce is creamy and flavourful and they're quite generous with the amount they put on each dish. We ordered the breakfast poutine with poached eggs and the avocado, brie and bacon benny. Both were delicious. Came here at around 12:45 on a Saturday. The wait was about half an hour for 2 people. Definitely worth the wait and definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Rude waitress. The most bland huevos rancheros, that looked like prison food. \"Very spicy\" hot sauce was as mild as ketchup, and could not save our tasteless meal. Cash only. Really don't get the hype."}
{"text":"This is my favourite brunch place!! I usually get the cheddar and mango benny (the mango goes so well with it!), with a peanut butter banana shake (delicious!!) Their french toast (bread pudding style), huevos migas and apple crisp are also really good. If you are going on a weekend, make sure to go early (before 9:30am) if you don't want to line up! And they only take cash.."}
{"text":"Worth the wait!! I've never been seated here in under 30 min, but the brunch is absolutely worth the wait. They food and coffee is delicious and the staff is incredibly nice and friendly. I promise you, Lady Marmalade is worth the 30min wait on the street!!!"}
{"text":"Don't go on a cold day. Dont't go with a large group...but GO!

After a not horrendous wait outside we were seated. We ordered two of the breakfast dishes and the bread pudding for 'dessert'. The pulled pork benny was THA BOMB. So much flavour. I love strong tastes and this hit the spot. The bread pudding is an awesome take on french toast. Get both!!"}
{"text":"Best in the neighborhood.  I would go every weekend If I could justify Eggs Benedict Weekly.

Casual laid back, Always horrifically busy (I usually wait 30-45 min), excellent food. This place really utilizes the neighborhood offerings well, providing bread from the local baker, sausages from Rowe Farms, organics and locally sourced where possible. 

I always found our service to be what you would expect for a busy breakfast place. They come by to check on us, and refill coffee - its ok that we are not forming lasting relationships. The girls are all very nice.

Being that this is seconds from home I have frequented with my SO, various overnight guests, my girlfriends for Brunch, aunts and uncles from out-of-town and even my 3 year old nephew. Every single person we have ever brought here loved their meal. 

Notables - Eggs Florentine is Amazing. The Hollandaise is perfect, the salad has great dressing.  Heuvous Migas is a gigantic bowl of everything good including eggs and rice. Guests of mine have really enjoyed the Croce Monsieur Crepe and the Poached Egg BLT. The coffee is good enough, the iced ginger tea is not good. (powder mix?)  

People always have their kids with them, and its never an issue. I was thrilled to be able to take my nephew here when we were watching him. There was books for him to read and colouring essentials. Was perfect. 

I *think* its cash Only. TD Bank just down the street."}
{"text":"peanut butter and banana shake!!

definitely a great place to go if you want to have brunch. its a cozy place with great selections. their peanut butter and banana shake is addicting, I can never get enough!!"}
{"text":"The wait was about 30 minutes. 
But definitely worth it. 
Service was friendly and the bacon, avocado, Brie Benny was delicious. 

Hollandaise wasn't too rich, which made the combo pretty light tasting. 

Coffee was fresh and tasty after waiting in the cold. 
Will be back to explore the rest of the menu. 

Great little place perfect for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"What an awesome place! I have been going here for a couple years now, and when anyone I know wants brunch, I bring them here. Best eggs benny in the city hands down! They always cook their eggs to how you specify (I like my eggs benny poached medium) which is not as common as one would hope in restaurants. Never disappoints, always fresh and delicious. Very busy place get there early- be prepared to wait (but it is well worth the wait.) Service is friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"As a resident Leslieviller...Bonjour Brioche was the resident go-to brunch local for as long as I can remember (especially since it's at the end of my street) so I must admit that I was skeptical to try the new spot in town.  

Well, what can I say...WOW...Lady Marmalade just doesn't disappoint.  The food is to die for.  The Eggs Benny with brie, avocado and bacon smothered in the yummy hollandaise sauce leaves you wanting more.  Food is always fresh, hot and I appreciate their dedication to organic and local.

Keep it up Lady Marmalade!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend after seeing all the great reviews. I ordered the breakfast poutine and she ordered the huevos rancheritos. It took forever because they were so busy, not sure why because when our food came it sucked. Mine was basically day old hash browns with melted cheese on top, the miso gravy was basically non existent and there was probably 2 little slivers of scallion on top. My friend hated hers, they have her runny scrambles eggs mixed with runny salsa, the black beans were stuck together like mud. Really unappetizing. The only saving grace of the meal was the latte I got, it was well made and delicious. That and the cute pairs of different salt and pepper shakers on each table. Unfortunately, they are not what is going to make me ever step foot inside for any brunch ever again."}
{"text":"I have been a here a few times, usually having to wait in line outside on a Sunday morning. This time I came on a Tuesday afternoon and was able to get a seat right away. Eclectic old kitchen tables like Mom had back in the 70's gives it a retro decor. Mexican fusion inspired dishes give a new take on eggs and beans. I had the Huevos Rancheritos. It was a generous portion that was served hot and flavourful. Need to remember that they are cash only so don't be like me and have to run down to the corner bank machine after the meal."}
{"text":"Expect it to be crowded and a bit noisy, but well worth it.  I had the tomato pesto benedict and it was just as good as everyone said it would be. One of my tablemates had the Raspberry Baked French Toast and it was definitely fabulous too (although quite large ... take note!)  Very efficient service -- they like to move people through because it's a small and popular place. Cash only but there is a bank on the corner..."}
{"text":"My fav breakfast in the city!

Actually only one $ when you take into consideration the fact that they only use free range eggs and rowe farms meat.

Go at 9am, you won't have to line up :)

Eggs benny with tomato and pesto is the best, ever.  How on earth do they make that hollandaise????  I wish I knew."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try somewhere new for brunch last weekend. We waited about 20 minutes for a table but definitely well worth it. Good food, great service. The bacon was perfectly cooked, and I mean perfect. My boyfriend had one of the huevos dishes, and I had just the traditional breakfast. Will definitely be going back here."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this cute place! Definitely a hidden gem. Our waitress was polite and informative. Never had to wait for a coffee refill, our order was taken as soon as we were ready and our food came within 10 minutes. GREAT customer service and GREATTTT food! I had the avocado and brie bennie, it left me wanting more. My fiance had the AM poutine and the miso gravy was delicious. Definitely going back to try the french toast and spinach waffle!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant out after hearing such amazing reviews and seeing the incredibly long lineup on weekends. It was a Friday at 10:30am and the restaurant was still completely full (do Torontonians not have jobs?!) 

We ordered the pulled pork eggs benedict and the bacon, avocado and brie eggs Benny. The English muffin on both was nicely toasted with just the right amount of crunch and egg whites cooked through with yolk running perfectly. I'm not quite sure how they made the hollandaise sauce but the first bite was heavenly, almost tasted like a very buttery sour cream and had a smooth consistency. The pulled pork was a little bit dry but it may have been because it wasn't smothered in BBQ sauce. The flavours all in all went pretty well together. The side salad they served was delicious with an Asian inspired miso/soy dressing. 

The only downfall was the service was pretty average, with little to no contact from the servers. They forgot our juice and coffee order and brought it whe we were basically done our food. When we finished they asked if we would like anything else and we said no so they quickly brought us our bill. I felt a bit rushed out, the restaurant was emptying out and there wasn't much need for that push to pay since we did just receive a full glass of juice we had to drink which they forgot to bring. They did take it off the bill, however soon after we were told it was a cash only restaurant and we had to go find an ATM machine. This is something that should be mentioned up front or written in more plain view, instead it was in small letters on an open door that people were standing in front of and we couldn't see it. We then had to pay a $5 ATM fee. Not impressed at all.

All in all it was pretty good, but not a restaurant I would rave to come back to....it was just a more complex and refined greasy spoon. And the service was just awful. If the food wasn't so good I would have given the restaurant a 1 star."}
{"text":"Love love loooove this place. Would go here for breakfast every day if I could. Great food, good service. Although the refillable coffees go down to half cups after you've paid. A little slow on the water refills.. but easily something to overlook when the food is so yummy. Plus I feel better knowing everything is as organic and free range as can be. Be prepared for a wait though!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with a good friend for lunch.  I've been there twice now but can't remember what I had the first time - was so long ago.  But, yesterday I tried their Chicken Club and it was yummy.

The sandwich comprised of a big chunk of chicken breast, lettuce, tomato, onion with buttery toasted sour dough of some kind, sided with some salad lightly dressed.  Was very happy with the portion, quality and afterwards didn't feel bloated, but rightly fuelled.

The only downside is they only accept cash, their seating capacity and the absence of A/C units.  It gets hotter than a sauna in there during the summers.

The plus: the food, all-day breakfast and decor.

Overall, great place for lunch."}
{"text":"We went there yesterday after looking at google reviews for the best breakfast places downtown Toronto. It was our 4th anniversary and since I live close by, I thought we should give it a try. As everyone has been saying, the line up was about 20mins on a weekday afternoon and I was in a bad mood already as an old couple jumped the line and were given a table before us.

I wish they had a better ambiance. The furniture looks like they have grabbed it from a garage sale. The menu was half torn. The waitress was not very friendly and we asked her if they served omelets and we just got a plain response \"no\" and she just seemed very cold.

To be honest the food was good but it wasn't the best and it is exceptionally over priced though their quantity is quite big. I have had better breakfast across the GTA. It is not worth that much wait and hype."}
{"text":"I ve been here a few times and overall the food is very good.  They have this mexican-style egg dish (sorry, cant remember exact name) that is awesome - scrambled eggs, salsa, tortilla chips, guac...  You can tell everything is homemade.  I would go more often except there is always a long lineup on the weekends."}
{"text":"I just had the bacon avocado and brie eggs benny here and it was great. Coffee is stellar too, nice and strong. This is now my go-to breakfast place"}
{"text":"We visited LM on a Monday morning because (the far, far superior in every way) Bonjour Brioche sadly wasn't open. After waiting in line for about 30 minutes, we were seated by a server who seemed pretty disinterested in us. We both ordered the \"crepe croque monsieur\" which was almost inedible. The cream sauce tasted like hot lemon ice cream poured over ham. The potatoes tasted like they were day-old - dry and flavourless. I left half my meal on the plate, which I never, ever, ever do. I would go as far to say it one of the worst dishes I've had in a restaurant  - I couldn't get the sweet lemony taste out of my mouth for days. 

Just because a restaurant is in Leslieville, does not automatically mean it's good (despite being trendy to think so)."}
{"text":"They know how to do their eggs!!!

Good coffee and great ambience... it is a really nice place to come out with friends... very cozy....

wait is typically around 25-30 minutes"}
{"text":"Mediocre experience every time I come here. Not sure why there is always such a long line but there are many comparable or better options in the area, without the lineup."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here I had a pulled pork sandwich (I forget the official name) with carrot soup.  The sandwich was fantastic, fresh baguette, crispy veg and succulent pulled pork.  The carrot soup was surprisingly good without the addition of slot of herbs or spices.  Very simple but difficult to take my spoon from the bowl.  

Today I went for brunch.  Even at 1pm on a Wednesday there were people waiting for a table.  I hadn't eaten yet at this point so I decided to go breakfast.  Since I had already eaten the pulled pork sandwich, why not have the pulled pork eggs benedict?  Unreal good.  I started with the little side salad with crispy greens and a light Asian style dressing.  The combination of pulled pork and egg yolk was fantastic, all served atop a homemade English muffin.  I highly recommend this meal.

Weekends sound like dealing with the lineup are not worth it (no matter how good the food is).  Instead, take a day off work and have an amazing lunch or brunch."}
{"text":"We arrived around 8:15am on a Sunday morning, and got a table right away.  We were a party of two, but there were larger tables available as well.  By 8:30, the restaurant was full and there was a lineup.
The service was very good; the servers were very friendly and kept our coffees filled, which was a good thing as our food took awhile to come out.  It was worth the wait though.  I ordered Eggs Benny with tomato and pesto (added avocado) and my sister ordered Huevos Rancheritos.  Both were delicious and tasted fresh.
Lady Marmalade would get 5 stars from me if it weren't for the slightly long wait for the food, as well as some dust I noticed next to our table.  I'd still go back (although not after 8:30)."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday morning on the recommendations that it was vegan friendly. The best  part of our brunch was spent outside waiting for 45 minutes for a table. Inside, the noise was ridiculous, my ears were ringing, and conversations were not possible. My friends enjoyed their tofu scramble. I had the 2 eggs scrambled, which looked and tasted like it was cooked in the microwave. The bread was good. The servers were friendly but stressed out. The crowd was mostly 30-somethings.
I would not go back. I would not recommend it for an ejoyable brunch."}
{"text":"Happy Tummy!

Lady Marmalade quickly overcame a weak first impression to become one of the best brunches I've ever had.

When I arrived at 2:30 with E. \"Still not yelping\" H., there was no line but no free tables either.  Never having been before, we weren't sure if it was a seat-yourself system or if we should await an invite from a server.  We stood around somewhat aimlessly for a while before getting in a server's way and learning that we would be seated when something was ready (tip:  acknowledge your guests when they arrive.  Let them know you've seen them and will seat them when you can.  It only takes a second).  Service was brilliant after that.  Two very busy (yet very calm) servers tag-teamed the dining room providing excellent coverage and speedy service. 

D√©cor, as has been noted, is cutesy.  It's a bit warm inside but we got a seat by the door with a nice fresh draft once in a while.  This turned out to be particularly valuable (read on, grasshopper...)

The breakfast menu is small, but carries great offerings to suit any taste, including a range of creative bennies.  My trusty companion went for the roasted veggie and aged cheddar model, whose deliciousness I can personally vouch for.  I had Huevos Migas - moist and soft scrambled eggs with cheese and chorizo, deliciously seasoned rice and the best black beans I've ever had.  The beans were cooked from scratch in-house and stewed with tomato and cumin, giving them a lovely purple tinge.  Presentation was great - my plate came topped with sour cream, scallion shoots and a few sprigs of cilantro, the last of which was a bit visually overbearing and crowded my plate while I ate (maybe leave the long stems out next time).  The tortilla chips on the side of my plate served well to scoop at the beans, but I think they forgot the salsa.  

I'd bet this is a five-star joint that was a little off today, because I had a four-star experience.  The food was amazing, the presentation was great and the service was fantastic.  But there were a few details missing from the five-star brunch experience.  Oh, and they had a fire in the kitchen that left my winter coat smelling like a barbecue.  Ah well, there are dry-cleaners for that!*

* I haven't asked Lady Marmalade to pay for the dry-cleaning, but suspect that they would agree if given the chance."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this brunch place for months now, so when my friend suggested it I was ecstatic! 
We set up our brunch time for Sunday around 1pm. I got there before my DC's and waited in line (there is no waiting list, just wait in line and first come first serve) - unfortunately they don't seat you until all your party has arrived (that lost a star - I'd prefer a waiting list!) The wait was about 25 
min for a table of four (way less for a table of two).
The restaurant is a small space, with odd mismatched tables and chairs. Not shabby-chic...just shabby old cottage decor. So if you're looking for a fancy sit down ambiance - this isn't the place. There's no patio, but large windows that let the sun in. 
The menu doesn't have a ridiculous amount of brunch selection, but just good enough to play with your head - I couldn't decide between the eggs bennies, the spinach waffle and the frenchtoast - all sounded SO GOOD! vegetarian-friendly place with substitutes for meat items.
I ordered the lady marmalade bennies with roasted veggies and aged white cheddar ($12.50) - the egg's were poached perfectly, the veggies and potatoes were roasted well - the salad (??) I didn't touch, I don't understand the concept of salad at breakfast/brunch! Rest of our table ordered huevos migas, spinach waffle and crepe croque monsieuer - tried a bit of everything - all good, esp the spinach waffle! 
the service was nothing out of the ordinary, just swift and polite. our server suggested some items on the menu which was helpful. 
the lemonade ($3) I ordered was literally water with lemon squeezed in and tons of ice - it was disappointing and not worth it - I wish I stuck to water. 
overall I had a lovely brunch experience - the space/shabbiness was a bit off-putting, esp since the table we got was smack in the middle of the room and just seemed out of place and the waiting in line was slightly annoying, I prefer waiting lists instead so I don't feel like I'm going to lose my place if I step away. the food's really good and that's why they're always busy. 
around $12-14 average per person for brunch items. 

must try: eggs bennies and spinach waffles!"}
{"text":"This place is in the top 5 of any best brunch place listing in Toronto. The food is good. It has both a tradtional brunch and  mexican twist to it.  However, one would wonder whether it was worth the 1 hour wait.... 
There are many ways to optimise the crowd. You can hold the reservation for only 15 mins from the given time. Making people wait outside in the snow is not a great idea!"}
{"text":"Brunch, Great eggs benedict, Lovely atmosphere, Good service, Reasonable price... Most probably you need to wait in line for Brunch..."}
{"text":"Food: Pretty good. I got the buckwheat crepe with fruit, which was good- just not sure if it's worth waiting 25 minutes for. My husband got one of the huevos dishes, which I tried and it was quite good. The portion sizes are large, and he didn't finish it all. Price point is good for the food.

Service: Mediocre. The servers were friendly, but not overly attentive. When we were seated at a table for four after our wait in the line-up, they asked if we would be ok with switching to table for two if that opened up, which we were fine with. When it did open up, the server asked us to move over, but didn't bother to help carry any of our drinks and utensils over and quickly started setting up the table for four. Not cool.

Atmosphere: Busy. Obviously people come here for the food, which is dandy, but there's no room for relaxing post-meal because there's a line up out the door and around the corner so you feel bad for taking up a table when you're done eating. 

Line-up: Always. We went on a weekday around 11:30am and we waited about 25 minutes, but as soon as noon hit, the line-up was past the window. Just not sure if it's worth the line-up because there's other places to eat with less of a line-up. 

Bottom line: This review got a 4 star for the food, everything else is a 2 star."}
{"text":"Delicious. I had the eggs Benedict with avocado, bacon, and Brie and my husband had their eggs and toast with bacon. The service was friendly and the food was great, would definitely recommend! Go early to avoid a long line."}
{"text":"This place makes me wish I lived in Toronto -- good eggs benny are really hard to find, and Lady Marmalade makes them perfectly! The restaurant has a kitschy feel -- mismatched chairs, random assortment of light fixtures, etc. -- but the service is attentive and the food is excellent. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town. The only negative: this place is cash only."}
{"text":"Pretty average brunch place - I ordered their ham eggs benny and it was solid, but didn't blow my mind.  
We got there around 9:40 on a Saturday morning and only had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table - however, as we were eating we saw the line build to about 10-12 people."}
{"text":"I was so pleased with the brunch at Lady Marmalade. My sister and I went early on a Sunday morning. When we arrived we were third or fourth in line; it moved quickly. Once we sat down, the service was fast and friendly. I ordered The 2 Eggs breakfast with sausage and had the choice between two or three options. Everything was very good. My eggs were poached nicely and they weren't sitting in water, which is how I find poached eggs often arrive. They have gluten-free options for people with allergies. I will be back, and soon!"}
{"text":"The best egg benedic ever. It's a really nice place, friendly waiters and waitresses plus reasonable price range."}
{"text":"This Toronto version of a Victoria, BC staple has been open for over a year and still has weekend brunch crews spilling out into the street waiting for a table inside its eclectic walls.  Another contender for best French toast in the city, you may also want to try the breakfast poutine or the eggs benny with brie and avocado."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice.
I ordered egg Benedict for both times.

Their egg Benedict is the best for me so far. 
The fries is also nice and crispy.

I definitely go back to this place !"}
{"text":"I mean, it's average. Maybe BlogTO needs to find some new places for brunch. Nonetheless, decent food. But I don't get the hype honestly.... line ups? I guess?"}
{"text":"It was muggy and humid outside and I was down for some brunch lovin'. Getting there around 11, we were lucky to beat the rush aka a line formed snaking outside the door. The question of the day, is the line worth it?? 

As mentioned, it's a hot day so naturally, our server has decided to turn her polo into a belly top. Kinda weird to be face to face with someone's naval as you're ordering food, etc. But she was really great! Always on top of things with coffee and water refills. 

I ordered the blue cheese, chicken and bacon baguette sandwich. Also on the sandwich was spinach (cooked), tomatoes and red onion. The bread was nicely toasted and I like how it was just right, size-wise. The blue cheese didn't overpower the chicken or bacon. Everything sung together well. One snag was the bottom bread was a little soggy for the filling's moisture. Anwyho, I would've loved to eat my leftovers the next day but unfortunately I left my them on the table! Grrr. 

On the side was a little salad which tasted like the green salad at Japanese restaurants. Some iceberg lettuce, purple cabbage, black seseme seeds etc. It was all very fresh and tasty but kind of an odd combo with the sandwich. 

I kind wish I went for something a bit more breakfast-y but this is what I was feeling like at the time! We sat by the kitchen so I could see all the plates coming out and everything looked beautiful. I'd pop on a streetcar and visit this joint again."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Monday afternoon and it was super busy. The wait wasn't too bad, but once we were seated and ordered food it took over an hour to get our food. I got the salmon sandwich and it was really good, it made up for the long wait. 
Other than the service being slow, it was still a good meal."}
{"text":"Staff often overwhelmed to be attentive. Table setup clumsy, there are often groups of two at tables made for four and long line-ups. Why not have all tables for two that you can merge/separate and reduce the line up!"}
{"text":"+ Breakfast poutine!! Yes, that's apparently a thing 
+ Creative twist to the traditional Canadian delight 
+ Opens early - Great for breakfast 

Lady Marmalade is an unassuming caf√© that serves quality food in Leslieville, Toronto. This was my first stop in Toronto - I came here straight from the airport. I ordered 'breakfast poutine', in a hope that extra carbs will help me wake up. Symbolic meaning of eating a quintessentially Canadian dish on my first meal was also a plus.  
Their version of poutine featured very rich gravy sauce with a hint of miso paste. Poached egg and sliced green onion on top are also unconventional ingredients for a poutine. I believe the poached egg is what makes this dish 'breakfast'. Potatoes were seasoned with some mixed spices featuring red chilli. I liked the addition of miso and green onion - somehow this combination gave this dish a very Asian flavour. This is not your box-standard poutine. But if you want something different, I recommend it. 
By the way, Leslieville is located at the eastern end of downtown Toronto, not unlike Shoreditch of London. It's right next to downtown but has its own character - again, a bit like Shoreditch. But I didn't come across anyone with ridiculous beard that looks like a bird started to nest in it. So I'm inclined to believe Leslieville is more civilised than Shoreditch."}
{"text":"Yes and yes. Great breakfast. Great lunch.  I understand why there's a line up, can't do it myself but yeah worth it.  Simple, good food. Yes it will blow you away."}
{"text":"Had to wait in line for a while on a Wednesday at 11:30am but the eggs Benedict was definitely worth the wait! Cute atmosphere too."}
{"text":"We needed brunch.  We didn't think we could get in for brunch.  We dropped by anyway and were seated within 10 minutes.  

To the dumbasses who block the door when the waiting benches are clear, you're a dumbass :)

They sat us by the kitchen and we had a look through their menu.  After some thought I decided on the huevos migas.  The service was awesome, the people friendly and the coffee always near the top of my cup.

The huevos migas arrived and for some reason it reminded me of a Turkish breakfast.  I took my first bite and loved it.  It was done really well and cooked perfectly.  I worked my way around the plate trying the beans and nachos and that was also good.  The meal was very large and heavy and in the end I could not finish.  This meal actually warranted a nap but I had a long drive ahead of me that day.

The place is much bigger than I thought and less cramped.  I'd definitely come by again and try something else."}
{"text":"cute little brunch spot in leslieville. the wait SEEMS long but the line moves quickly - don't be discouraged! 

i had the crepe croque monsier which was DELICIOUS, and my friend had a variation of the heurvos ranchos. i'm not big into mexican fusion for that early in the day, but she loved it and i loved my crepe. the prices are very reasonable for the portion sizes, so i would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The best brunch I have had, bar none. Had the avacado, Brie and bacon benny. My wife had the bread pudding. Both were deadly!!"}
{"text":"Ok food but not worth the brunch lineup. Also way too crowded. Not even enough room for servers to move around comfortably. Decor is shabby chic more on the shabby side. Nothing to write home about. Wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Hollandaise sauce and long line ups... leg-end-dary!

As expected, there was a 30-45 minute wait.
And yes, it's worth it.

This is some serious brunch.
I almost always get the bennie - brie, avocado, and bacon (13.50)
If you are craving french toast, they do sell out, so I recommend getting there earlier.

This is one of my favourite brunch spots in the city.
The food is fantastic.
The service is as good as it can be for such a busy place.
They have coffee cups and corning-ware that you'd see at your grandma's house.

I love this place."}
{"text":"The closest thing to California style brunch in toronto. Great, fresh food and lots of options for vegans and gluten free folks without sacrificing for the people who eat everything. Cash or debit only so come prepared. Oh, and their drip coffee is local fave Pilot roasters. Watch the free refills or you will leave with a serious buzz!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Leslieville my entire life, I've never visited Lady Marmalade despite the lavish praise I've heard about this place. I decided on visit on a Thursday afternoon.

I pass by this restaurant daily and there is ALWAYS a line up. On my way to the restaurant, there was a couple walking in front of us and I had a feeling they were heading to the same place (and they were!) Once I got there, the restaurant was full, busy, and brimming with chatter (in a good way). The interior of the restaurant is very cute like a home kitchen. The couple I was trailing was in line in front of me. I waited approximately 5-10 minutes before being seated (not bad). 

I ordered the poached egg blt with bacon and avocado ($11.50) with the freshly squeezed orange juice ($3.50) and my boyfriend ordered the huevos migas ($11.50). 

Food came in maybe 10-15 minutes. Everything looked and tasted very fresh and yummy. The BLT was kinda hard to eat because it was piled really high. I used my hands and everything was messy but I didn't really mind. I enjoyed the spicy mayo on the BLT and the potatoes were pretty good with an interesting spice. But... nothing was outstanding. To be honest, everything tasted exactly as what I make at home for breakfast. 

Prices were a bit high IMO for breakfast but portions are pretty huge. I wish I could give 3.5 stars. Not bad but I can't see myself coming back again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was wavering between 3 and 4 stars because I found my dish a little bland. My husband enjoyed his but I wasn't particularly fond of his either. However I did enjoy the breakfast poutine so perhaps the dishes we ordered were just not for my taste. I ordered the huevos rancheritos and my husband ordered the huevos migas.

Service was fast and polite. Even the wait to get in despite the line was not that bad.

Because my husband enjoyed it, will likely come back and will try something else next time."}
{"text":"The best egg benny I have had ever.
Waitress came to refill coffee several times even though crowded.
I wanna come back again."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! Had the eggs benny and they were delicious. Came with side potatoes and salad."}
{"text":"Great little place on the east side to get brunch! I had to wait about 20mins outside for a table, but one of the servers came out to greet us and tell us how long it would be. Service was prompt, and our food came on time. I got the smoked in house salmon Benedict. It came with a side of potatoes and tomatoes. The Benedict itself was good! Eggs cooked easy to how I like them, runny. I would have liked more salmon in the Benny, felt like I couldn't taste much of it and the potatoes were a bit too fried for me. No complaints other than that! Would go back to try what other items the menu has to offer."}
{"text":"I was dancing in the rain this morning when waiting the lineup....

Then bam my table.

So many people bragging about this gem I had to pay a visit.

Verdict: Hipsters cooking, that must be good. Well, it is good.

I ordered bennies (benedict eggs). Boy, top quality and execution of poached eggs

Home fries, meh, bacon, meh, but the dressing on the side salad was a nice surprise. A sesame vinaigrette.

I would like to brunch again and order something more crazy like the mexican breakfast or the crepe.

The decor is a mixture of old fashioned and comfort.

Cool stuff.

The place is always packed it seems so be patient. 

What I would change is the name of huevos migas in the menu. First of all huevos migas is scrambled eggs with tortilla and the menu says otherwise putting tortilla chips on the side. Correct me if I am wrong, I did not try this item. 

But do not try to argue with me I am Mexican. I know what huevos migas is. Trust me.

Second 

Gordita tortita

Ok either you make a gordita or tortita. You can not just have them both. Is like saying can I order a pizza burger.... 

But next time I will try this.

 I think that these guys are smart enough to notice this discrepancies but on the other hand it is just the use of regional food names implemented into a hipsterized menu. Don't mind it but sounds not really genuine.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Summertime sadness - Lady Marmalade used to be a weekend haunt for me, with the main draw being their awesome cheddar, bacon, & mango salsa eggs benny with my occasional switch to brie, avocado, bacon. Always with a side of thickly-cut rounds of tomato slices sprinkled with sea salt (an option instead of the side salad, which is also pretty good), and their house made hot sauce on the side to smother on the crispy potatoes.  While still tasty, I miss their house-made lemony hollandaise sauce which I would've basically stuck straight into my veins if it were an option.  Oh, it's not?  Okay, I'll settle on taking extra hollandaise on the side (for a couple bucks more).

The crowds usually going out the door and along the windowsill on the sidewalk.  On the inside, the scene is hipstery - bare-bones on mismatched old diner tables, vintage salt & pepper shakers found from various flea markets, olden-timey coffee mugs and those ubiquitous brownish-clearish plastic cups for water, and the daily specials scrawled across a blackboard.

This place is cash only and closes at 3pm - important things to remember if you're coming in for some hangover comfort."}
{"text":"A friend of mine insisted we try this place for breakfast, so I gave in and made the trek down to experience it.

Everyone has mentioned the line-ups, and, yes, it's true: the wait is pretty terrible. However, I am not opposed to a line-up if the food and service is truly spectacular and makes up for it.

In this case, there is simply nothing special about this place. I love going out for breakfast and there's so many breakfast spots to choose from in Toronto - there's nothing that stood out about Lady Marmalade to me, that would invite me back for another round.

I had a vegetarian omelette, and I also tried out my friends' dishes (eggs benedict, which was pretty good; some other eggs poached, etc). My omelette was OK; again, not bad, just not terribly memorable. I honestly can't even remember what was in it.
I had some sort of coffee - really bland and overpriced. I remember thinking I'd have to stop after for another coffee somewhere.

The service was decent; our waitress was kind and although in a rush, didn't make us feel completely ignored or anything. 

The general atmosphere was ok. Casual, chilled out type of place, from what I could see: hipster glasses with no lenses and floppy-haired guys in skinnies as far as the eye could see...it was kind of funny to overhear conversations, so that was amusing for a while.

I'd give this place another chance, but probably only because my friend seemed to really like it. Otherwise, there's too many other places that can make a mean egg benny AND seat me for breakfast before lunch time."}
{"text":"Being from the East end, I always see the longest line up for this place. So I gave it a shot to see what the hype was all about. 

Why this place kinda sucked:

1) waited 45 minutes in the cold cause they're a small shop and the line is outside 
2) they put me and my BF at a table just above their floor vent so there was a nasty breeze grazing my leg 
3) I ordered the banana bread French toast - big mistake. Way too sweet, soggy as f, and COATED in syrup. I literally had a bite and put down my fork. 
4) coffee = watered down, like an intercontinental breakfast. 

The only redeeming quality was that my BF ordered an eggs benedict which was average. At least they know how to poach an egg. 

Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! Came here for brunch on a long weekend. They're open til 3pm on holidays. It was convenient to find street parking. Restaurant was busy and there was a line up out the door but the wait wasn't long. First come first serve basis. 

Servers were polite and attentive but they didn't mention their specials to us prior to taking our orders. We had no idea that their special was written on the chalkboard near the kitchen of the restaurant. They also only accept debit or cash. 

We ordered the spicy salmon sandwich and the salmon egg benedict which both were tasty. We also had coffee with our meal which I personally thought was horrible. I like my coffee black and it tasted too sour for my liking. I don't think that fresh coffee should taste sour at all. 

Overall, it wasn't a bad experience but this place don't often come to mind when I think brunch."}
{"text":"While I love the concept of brunch on weekends, I am rarely available to enjoy this leisurely meal.  I am busy on Sundays from 11a.m. so I'm always on the hunt for breakfast/brunch places that open at 8 or 9a.m.  

I was overjoyed to see that Lady Marmalade opens this early on a Sunday and made plans to have brunch with a friend.  I've heard about the long line-ups at LM but thought to myself, \"Who wakes up at 8a.m. on a Sunday?\".  The answer: NOBODY.  We had no trouble finding parking directly outside the restaurant.  (Bonus: we didn't even have to pay for street parking because it was so early on a Sunday.)

We had our choice of pretty much any table and chose a cozy one against the wall near the front of the restaurant.  Service was very friendly. Coffees and waters were topped up regularly.

I ordered the French toast of the day - infused with strawberries.  I had not properly prepared myself for the gigantic portion, but had no problem stuffing it all in.  I could easily have this for breakfast everyday!  The French toast I make at home does not take like this.  This bread creation had soaked up a lot of juices and flavours and was baked to perfection.  While soft and spongy, it was not mushy.

I love the unique tables and chairs and dishes.  Such a cute and cozy place.  Other customers started to roll in closer to 9.  I have passed by a few other times around 10 or 11am and have seen the line-ups outside.  Well worth the wait, in my opinion.  (But can't say I've done it.)

Thanks for accommodating my crazy schedule!"}
{"text":"Expect a line so come prepared for that. Come prepared for large portions and unique dishes. Couldn't decide what to get with such a great menu."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype and is so worth the wait. My friends and I were so satisfied with the food. I got the eggs benny with brie and avocado and it was AMAZING. Would definitely recommend if you love brie like I do! We also got the poutine as an appetizer of sorts, but the portions are really good here so we were super stuffed by the end, and would probably opt out of an appetizer next time. 

Although this place is worth the wait, I hate waiting in line to eat no matter where I am, which is why I just can't give them 5 stars. Besides that I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Had a casual brunch with friends on the weekend just passed.  First time at LM.  We arrived a little after 10, and just as other yelpers mention, after 10am = waiting.  We waited for about 25 minutes, but oh so worth it.  Myself ordered the Avocado, brie and bacon bennie.  The english muffin was a bit too crisp, but the flavours were just heavenly.  The hollandaise sauce wasn't overwhelming, but was a touch lemony which was nice.  Good serving of avocado.  My partner ordered the porridge which was good too.  Good size, topped off with fried plantains and a dollop of sour cream.  I had a bite of a friends strawberry and cream cheese french toast, which was pretty much like bread pudding...awesome!

Will be back to taste all the other things that I wanted to try my first day."}
{"text":"You'll have to wait an hour to get into this joint but it is well worth the wait! My wife and I went with 2 of our good friends and together we tried the spinach and bacon waffles, hash brown poutine and the Moroccan scramble! The waffles were amazing! Not normally a fan of spinach with my brunch but this was definitely the best dish from our experience. The Moroccan scramble was full of flavour with more ingredients than I can remember but definitely worth a try. The hash brown poutine was good but was a tad underwhelming (not enough gravy and the potatoes were mieh). Overall, if you're a fan of brunch, get up early and check this place out...you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my friend and had the eggs benny. It was simple and delicious. I will definitely be back, but will not line up for it again."}
{"text":"Only place in the GTA where eggs benedicts comes with a combo of avocado, bacon, and brie (must I say.. it's the best combo ever).  Excellent bread pudding (they call it french toast) with rotating flavours.  Minus one star for the long lines, but only b/c it's so popular.  If it weren't for those, I'd probably be there every week.  Easy access via the Queen 501 streetcar."}
{"text":"Make time for lineup ! I tried lining up 3x, third time was a charm to finally get in.  During weekend hours, I had waited over and hour to get in!  Make sure you are prepare to wait for your brunch!

As other yelper recommended , ordered the avocado egg Benedict's. They do make a mean Benny.  It comes runny, perfect to dip toasted bread or the side potatoes.  The home fries portions are huge, but crisp to perfection.  Our whole table got a various variation of egg benedicts, and all meals were wonderful. Definitely will reorder everything!

Star deduction due to the wait.  Everyone has to arrive to be seated.  If you are pre-waiting for someone, make sure all your parties arrive by the time you reach the door!"}
{"text":"Came to Lady Marmalade for brunch on Saturday. Seriously, come here earlier (we came around noon) because the line up goes out the door and there's a good reason for that. Their food is amazing. We ordered an apple cider and beets, apple and ginger juice - both very good and refreshing. I got the brie, avocado & bacon benny ($15) and he got the huevos migas ($12.50) and they were both so flavourful and tasty. 

Our server always checked up on us at the right time and super attentive. Would definitely come back to try their other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Spending the long weekend in Leslieville, I made the streetcar ride back out for brunch around 1:45pm.  Real jerk doesn't open til 2, so we waited in line for a table at Lady Marmalade.  As soon as we sat down, all the other tables cleared out. 
This is a vegan-friendly place that serves bacon- a now recurring theme among popular brunch places.  I guess it's very Toronto of a place to cater to both ends of the spectrum.  
The huevos rancheritos were too much food for me to finish.  They are served in a deep and wide plate which is half full of black beans. They are good, but I know how they are a magical fruit. Speaking of fruit, i didn't get any, even as a garnish. Anyway, the guac and cilantro and onion garnish was good and added to the heaviness of the beans and eggs.  
My major complaints was the evidence of canned tomato on the BLT. 
I suppose in these locavore times they didn't want to ship the tomatoes all the way from Cali for a little bacon, lettuce and TOMATO sandwich. But, canned? Maybe a note (like I saw at Burger Bar) stating that only fresh tomatoes are served when they can find them ripe etc... would have made my SO choose another meal. Instead  he had poached egg, bacon and a little bit of bread. 
Hideous 70's fabric-coated chairs."}
{"text":"Long wait for weekend brunch but well worth it. Food is really good and fresh. Great way to start a Sunday."}
{"text":"i removed one star only for the 45 min wait in line.  
for the food, i would give 5! the Benny du jour spicy sausage, avocado, cilantro cream was just delicious and was worth the wait
the holandaise sauce was perfect"}
{"text":"Fantastic Brunch spot in Queen East! 
It's one downfall is the line up sometimes but that's about it!
The eggs benny with cheddar, bacon and mango is soooo good. MMmmmm.. The coffee is so fresh and your cup is never empty even with busy weekend mornings. The staff are always smiling and I have very little bad things to say.
The only other thing is I wish there was more options for sides - maybe fruit salad as I'm not much of a green salad gal first thing in the morning."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to be able to try brunch at this restaurant on a week day and avoid the weekend line ups.. but I think the line up would be worth it.

The decor is nothing special, and I wouldn't consider this a \"date\" place (compared to i.e. Mildred's), but the food is enough to make up for that! Based on recommendations off Yelp, I ordered the cheddar and spinach waffles, and my brunch date ordered the breakfast poutine. We both agreed that the waffles were better than the poutine. 

And surprisingly, the part of my dish that I found most memorable - because it was that good and went so well with the waffles - was the roasted tomatoes   Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"The wait was 45 mins on a sunny Sunday morning arriving at 11am. The benny was ok, the taters were seasoned, but there weren't many of them which was odd considering the amount of empty space on the serving plate.  The organic eggs gave the yolk an orange color that gave it a thicker consistency, but it was poached well, oozing over the bacon and toast. The bread however was too toasted, making the bottom much too tough to cut through.   The hollandaise was flavourable with a hint of lemon kick that worked well.   

The Crepe Croque Monsieur was tasty, the mix of cheese and ham worked well with the cream sauce, but I didn't care too much for the presentation of it in a little side dish, which eating it messy because the cream kept dripping everywhere."}
{"text":"Busy little place with good food...

Expect to wait 39-45 mins before your seated and another 30 mins before you are served. The eggs benny is great and so are their sandwiched.  Great place for a super early breakfast or a late lunch. If ur there between 10:30 - 11:30 the wait is ridiculously long."}
{"text":"So what if I need to get a triple bypass after eating the bacon, brie, and avocado benny? On the operating table, I would mumble, \"I want more,\" as the fear of death would be quelled by the residual taste of brunch in my mouth.

The eggs were perfect (Yes. EggZ. Two of 'em. Nice and generous portions). The hollandaise? On-point, lemony, thick without being gooey. Just as it should be. Pure delicious. Bacon crispy. Brie there, but not overpowering. Avocado ripe and flavorful. All on a pastry-like bread. Good lord! 

Potatoes also good but not outstanding. I liked the side salad a lot - Japanese style crunchiness with sesame dressing. Good to join the dairy and meat party in my stomach (like a femme queer activist at a frat party, needed but unexpected).

The chai latte: teabag brewed in water with added soy milk. Loved their soy foam - airy, long-lasting, creamy. As for the chai tea itself, it was a good mix of tea and spices, but just didn't brew strongly enough. Result? Watered-down chai. Bummer.

My partner had the savory waffles that sounded delicious to me (bacon and cheddar, etc.). But they were actually quite sweet with savory layered on top - which made more for mortal combat than immortal marriage vow in my mouth. Not my favorite.

Service was pretty good for it being busy. Our main waitress in particular was great. Sometimes hard to get water and coffee refills. 

We got there just shy of 12pm and were seated in 30 minutes (despite the hostess approximation that it would only be 10-15 minutes). Still, nothing compared to the line we saw out the window once we were already digging into our food. Painful for them. A sadistic bout of satisfaction for us.

The interior? I wouldn't say kitschy and I wouldn't say hippy. Just a warm, fairly minimal, clean, simple environment. Music they were playing was Caribou's latest album, which gives you a sense of the \"mellow-hip\" atmosphere there. 

Believe the hype. This place is darn tasty and worth the wait."}
{"text":"I get excited to go here for Sat/Sun brunch. The only problem is the wait, so get there early. This place is family friendly unlike Pulp Kitchen that used to own the space. They even have a small nook with crayons, books and a black board for the kids. Did I mention that the food is really great?"}
{"text":"MMMMMM. Just reading the menu over again is making me want to drive there right now and bang on the door until someone opens the place up! I didn't know what I was getting into except for the word \"breakfast\". 

I took my gf on a and we waited about 15 mins which wasn't all that long considering it was gorgeous out. By the time we got to sit down a few tables were open so we decided to sit by the window. Honestly, we don't have much experience with many breakfast places outside the franchise places so we were both nervous and excited. 

I got \"huevos migas\" which included 3 scrambled eggs, mixed with cheese, topped w/ tomatoes, spicy sausage (just a nice little kick) basmati rice and soft beans. organic corn tortilla chips and sour cream. BAD ASS! wow I was so pleasantly surprised at how good it was. It came pretty quickly too. I couldn't even finish my very decently sized portion. I personally think you can share most of the meal with someone else if you wanted too. All that for $11.50. Not bad right?

My girlfriend ordered something a little bit more simple since she's so picky lol. She had the black forest ham lady marmalade bennie (w/ bacon) which was served with potatoes. The lemony hollandaise sauce was sooo on point. I could pour that hollandaise on anything and eat it I think. Oink oink I know but it was good :D Her dish was $10.50 + $1.50 for bacon.

Make note of the hours of operation just in case you're coming from far away. I recommend the window seat if you can get it. I can't wait to go back again and again."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch place - I enjoyed the benny with mango salsa. Attentive, friendly service, decent coffee and a delicious eggs benedict - what's not to like. 

Don't accept credit (or cards like Monzo from the UK) though, so keep cash or a debit card handy."}
{"text":"I ordered the eggs Benny with spinach, avocado, Brie! It was delicious and healthy, but like anything else in Toronto that I have tried so far, I would not wait over 30 minutes for this!

Great customer service but not sure if I'll go back again as war too crowded."}
{"text":"Food looked great, wish we had the opportunity to actually eat. Restaurant closed at 3, we called in to check before heading there. They confirmed and we said \"ok heading in now\". Got there by 2:30, there was a line, so we waited outside in the cold for 10 mins before we actually stepped in (b/c the line was to the door). Got in, waited another 10-15 only to be told that we couldn't be seated b/c they didn't foresee another table becoming available before 3. Mind you we were the last people in line, with only a party of 2. It seemed absolutely ridiculous that they couldn't accommodate us. Especially after I mentioned that we called before coming. At the end of the day it was a wasted $16 uber ride only to get turned away and spend more money on an uber to find another restaurant. So word to the wise, don't bother coming that last hour they're \"opened\". As you can see from other reviews there's always a line, and getting in line by a certain means nothing to them."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful breakfast/brunch/lunch spot. Humble and unassuming, the menu is concise and has a good variety. There are also healthy options too! I ordered the Huevos Racheros, which were huge portions!! Could've fed 2 for sure. The ingredients were fresh, kept simple, and the eggs were perfectly poached. My dining partner had the poutine, which was really delicious. Americano completed the meal, dark roasted with perfect water ratio. Would def come again!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on sunday at 9:30am and there was already a line outside the door.

However, it seemed like there was high turnover and we didn't have to wait long before we were seated.  

Ordered one of their specials of the day: jerk chicken benny as well as the brie, bacon and avocado benny.  My salad was drenched in oil/dressing which made it difficult to eat, and I asked for hollandaise on the side, which I'm glad I did, as the portions were small but extremely filling and heavy.  

Prices are decent for the area and the food was tasty, but I'm not sure I'd wait in line again for brunch here.  

Coffee was a bit watered down.

Cash only!"}
{"text":"I had the avocado, bacon, and brie Bennys.

Wins: great combination of flavours, the egg benedicts were perfectly cooked, side of salad was a great addition

Things that could use improvement: not much! Prepare to line up, future diners :)"}
{"text":"Come early, huge line but overall, wait wasnt too long (about 15minutes at noon on a Saturday)

Went to brunch with a bro, yes bros can go on brunch. Arrived at noon and place was buzzing. Great cozy atmosphere with a diner feel to it.

Ordered egg's benny because it seemed to be a fan favourite here and we were certainly not disappointed.

My buddy got the avocado brie and bacon benny and I got the pulled pork benny. Egg was perfectly cooked and both were delicious. If it were up to me, I would pick the avocado brie and bacon over the pulled pork. There is just something about the brie and avocado that blended very well with the hollandaise sauce in a rich savoury manner.

I was quite surprised how full I got, especially since we both came after a workout and was pleasantly filled. 

Last thing was just the potatoes. They had the right crisp to them but would have been better if there were some herb seasoning to it, like dill or something.

Overall, great brunch spot and would come back again"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect! The only slightly less than ideal part was the 15 minute wait time, which built up anticipation for the meal. The Benedict's were to die for! I had one with Brie, avocado, and bacon, and my boyfriend had one with bacon, cheddar, and mango salsa. The coffee had a nice kick that we needed this morning! We had a tall male server who was very attentive, and his female coworker was also helpful and topped up our coffees. The hostess was lovely! The coffee mugs reminded my boyfriend of his grandma's house as a kid. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went back today, and I have to upgrade my star rating. Everything is delicious here. Everything. I take back what I said about waiting in line. It is so worth it. GO! 

p.s. the coffee is a touch weak. Just an FYI if you are heading there after a late night."}
{"text":"They will not take reservations so long waits in Long lineups, I met friends there so I waited in line for about 40 minutes only to be disappointed by a noisy, overpriced restaurant with slow service.  Had some soggy, oversweet, French toast. I would not do this again for sure."}
{"text":"Where trendy trumps quality. I don't get the good reviews or line-ups for this place. I've frequent this place a few times simply because it is right around the corner from my home and I like eggs Benedict. While it started to become a regular spot for me and my friends, it wasn't because it was good. It was because it was convenient. Today, I made the final decision, no more.  Primarily because of the poor service, poor attitude and no flexibility.  I wanted to order the Eggs Benny with avocado, and brie cheese but wanted to substitute the brie for cheddar. This seemed to be just too much for them to handle. Because of the substitution, my order would have to be classed as a \"build your own\" at a highly inflated price. I understand no substations sometimes, but brie for cheddar isn't rocket science and they did have cheddar on the menu and the attitude that followed just turned me right off. So many establishments want my business, why settle for one that simply doesn't care. I cancelled my order and left, and I will also cancel my once a week visit with friends. I hate to be so negative but I do feel it is important to say it the way it is. I don't expect excellence, I just expect effort. It's worth a lot to me when someone just simply tries or at very least pretend to care."}
{"text":"Lady Marmalade, it hurts me to do this since I've been praising how marvelous the breakfast is here but my last visit was, in the great words of Morrissey, truly disappointing.
Why is it when you rave about how great a place is and you even make your parents wait in the heat in the slow-moving line that a place doesn't live up to the hype you created?
First off, it was super hot inside. The ceiling fans and air-conditioner weren't cutting it. I ordered the same dish (organic tofu scramble) as I had last time because I loved it so much. what i got this time was a mouthful of salt. all that boasting I did, I felt the need to finish it but I just couldn't. There was too much soy sauce on the sauteed bok choy and mushrooms. The potatoes were bland. My husband's huevos rancheritos was bland and definitely different from the last time. I know every place has its bad days so I'm not writing Lady M off yet but I might be less eager to stand in the long line next time. truly, truly, truly disappointing."}
{"text":"My friend and I went on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. We waited in line for about 20 minutes for a table. We both ordered the weekend eggs benny special with avocado and chorizo sausage. It came with a side of salad and potato hash. The egg was poached well and the food was seasoned well. The way they seasoned the sausage complimented the avocado taste. 

I took one star away because they only take cash."}
{"text":"I had the great pleasure of having the best breakfast I've had since Dos Caminos in NYC. There was always a lineup but it was 100% worth the wait. 

Once seated, service was quick and efficient. We had coffee in minutes and orders taken shortly there after. 2 of my breakfast mates had the Eggs Benny with Avocado and loved it and myself and my other breakfast mate had the Huevos Migas... It was so many flavour sensations in your mouth... As I write this I only wish I had it in front of me.

They only take cash so be prepared for that (although there's a TD a few doors down). 

The only downside to this venue is that its poorly ventilated so you come out smelling like your breakfast. 

All in all, the food is incredible, the atmosphere is lovely, the staff are very sweet and there are unique people coming in and out and its amazing who you might just see while visiting Lady Marmalade."}
{"text":"We arrived at 9 this morning having heard about long lines for this spot. Got the last table and had great expectations considering most reviews.  We ordered 3 lattes, 1 croque monsieur and 2 banana walnut french toast. Lattes tasted okay but were not very hot. Croque monsieur was dull with eggs overcooked. And before our 'French Toast' (bread pudding) arrived, we were told they had just run out of the banana walnut and had only one on offer. They did have an apple chai so one of us graciously said she would take the substitute. When the plates arrived, our waitress said, so sorry they only had the apple chai french toast after all and here it is. No option to make another breakfast choice which is what I would have done. But because it would have meant waiting while the other two ate theirs, I said ok. (Yes, I did so grudgingly.) The bread pudding (why not call a spade a spade) was soggy and though stuffed with apple bits, very disappointing. I love my brunches and drive far for a good meal. Sorry folks, they don't make the cut."}
{"text":"The Spot
Have you ever gone out for a big night on Queen west, only to wake up the next day and be forced to re-live every embarrassingly (awesome) moment over breakfast? Are you tired of forcing hungover smalltalk with every one you know at those trendy west end brunch spots? Now imagine somewhere warm and comforting where they will keep your coffee cup full, feed you and all without the pressure of a see and be seen brunch experience. It's time to switch up your weekend morning routine to some east side brunch time loving!

Located in the emerging Leslieville neighbourhood on Queen east at Logan, Lady Marmalade has everything your breakfast/lunch/brunch loving self desires.

Whats Really Good?
Eggs Benedict is the standard by which any self respecting brunch restaurant is measured. Lady Marmalade does not disappoint, they have a full selection of bennies with plenty of options to satisfy both vegetarians and boring old omnivores. The hollandaise sauce is fantastic, but if you're feeling adventurous the menu has much more to offer.

Regular breakfast and lunch fare at Lady Marmalade stands out with eclectic twists on traditional recipes. Asian and South American inspirations pop up in delightful places throughout the menu, such as the miso scallion gravy which is served with the Crepe Croque Monsieur, or the Mango salsa on the Avocado, Brie & Bacon sandwich.

You'll Wanna Know
You should expect a line, so try to be sneaky by sending friends ahead of time. Tables will only be seated if the full party is there, so by the time you show up (fashionably late) your friends/line holders, should be right at the front (mission accomplished). Alternatively, just get every one to show up a bit on the early side to beat the line up and get in before the daily specials have sold out (this will help keep you in your friends good graces).

Also its cash only, and they don't serve poutines on weekends - bummer."}
{"text":"Had a line up out the door. Only waited about 20 min, so it was ok. Good eggs Benedict, pulled pork was good. I didn't find it to be \"the best brunch in the city\" but definitely a cute, small, charming brunch spot, best for groups of 2-4. I would recommend/go back again."}
{"text":"When I first started coming to Lady Marmalade I was in love. Everything I tried was delicious and perfectly put together. It has been a couple years since my first time...and I still can't stop getting in (whatever size) line there is to get any one of the many Benedict's on the menu! Often I try to convince lots of friends to come with me so I don't feel guilty ordering the French Toast of the day to split for dessert!

With that being said- I just want the staff/ manager/ owner to read that I have been a little disappointed my most recent 2 visits. I really hope it was just a bad coincidence but both time my poached eggs were way over cooked, my toast was so hard it might have chipped a tooth if I wasn't careful and I couldn't even tell my waitress because she was some sort of a customer avoider extraordinaire.  

Obviously I will still be back, in hopes that those were just a couple of 'one offs'."}
{"text":"I think this place is a total gem of leslieville! It's my favourite breakfast spot to this day in toronto. Servers are friendly and set up is very quaint and cozy. Very hipster vibe to it. Pricing can be a little steep, but portions are fair and leave you well satisfied. Duely note it can be quite a wait on week during morning to early afternoon which is pretty standard of any brunch spot and it is cash only. Kitchen has an open concept where you can see chefs making the good which I always love!"}
{"text":"I visited Lady Marmalade for brunch with my sister. We arrived and waited about 15-20 minutes to be seated. I can understand that on a weekend you will have to put in some waiting time to be seated for brunch, my only problem was the waiting area. There is absolutely no space at the front door ti wait without being brushed by when someone wants to exit. We were seated and attended to immediately. I ordered a hot chocolate with marshmallows. I'm a sucker for marshmallows in my hot chocolate, it was so cute and made me feel warm inside. I ordered the A.M. poutine with pulled pork and may I say it was delicious!!! I didn't expect it to fill me so much but I was so satisfied. We felt adventurous and ordered the bread pudding to close off our meal and I wasn't pleased with it. I was expecting it to be sweeter, it lacked any real flavour other than the fruits on top. I would definitely visit again, I enjoyed the quaintness of it and the poutine was amazing for a low price."}
{"text":"Love their bennies. I have tried a few different places but this is the best. 
I have been there for 3 times and each time the wait is about 15-20 minutes."}
{"text":"Love this place! If you're going for brunch on the weekend, get there early. We arrived at 7:55 to wait on line. Doors open at 8am and every table was full by 8:08am. I liked this place because the offering was unique. Various takes on eggs Benedict. The cheese/spinach waffle was great. The salads were also a welcome addition. And freshest squeezed juice. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far hands down the best breakfast in the entire city (tied with Niagara Street Cafe). I don't get down here as much since moving from Queen and Carlaw however I do trek my butt across the city every month to enjoy their delicious offerings. Because I did go here so often when I lived around the corner I have tasted the entire menu. My faves: The Benny with spinach, and the salmon sandwhich with the mango salsa on it which you should do yourself a favor and order... its out of this world... yeah I know you came for brunch but theres a lunch in brunch so do the lunch part of brunch instead of the breakfast part. Your stomach will thank you.

The decor is lovely mid century modern which I am a huge fan of... The service is hit and miss, sometimes excellent, sometimes a little erm... but the food makes up for it for me. I also avoid going there at really busy times and find the service is better when they are not overwhelmed by swarms of hungry people. They do need a busser really baddly, and I wish they would make people park their gigantic bugaboo frogs outside... dealing with your kids screaming while I am trying to nurse my hang over with awesome food is enough... trying to manuver through the obstacle course created by parents who have gigantic strollers NOT COOL.

Get a busser and efficient waite staff and I'll give you 5 stars. The food is 5 stars for me... but the service takes away one. I still love this place and think everyone should eat here. I also think you guys should open a place in the west end maybe around College and Dovercourt where I live so I can again eat here twice a week like I did a year ago when I lived in Leslieville."}
{"text":"Lady Marmalade is a casual, reasonably priced place to eat. For this type of restaurant I have to say it is \"as good as it gets.\"  However, if I were to compare it to a more upscale place it would not be as appealing, which is why I gave it 4 and not 5 stars.

One gripe: they did not make the best use of the space in the room. There are 4 seater tables with 2 diners all over the restaurant. If they had all 2 seater tables they could push them together and pull them apart to better utilize the space in the room and shorten the wait. There is ALWAYS a lineup here. 


The food was great! I had heuvros ranchitos and a mango smoothie both were very good. Good sized portions too.

My friend had one of the Benes and she said it was delicious. I eyed the people's food at the tables next to me and everything looked fantastic, french toast, crepes etc.

Price for 2 breakfast dishes, a smoothie, OJ and coffee - $41 before tip. 

I'll definitely be back here for brunch!"}
{"text":"Waited about 15 minutes for a table for 2, and it was definitely worth it. I got the eggs benny special with peameal and melted cheese (can remember which type), with perfectly poached eggs and hollandaise. Home fries were actually well seasoned and not a bland filler item like most diners. Totally satisfied and will be returning to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Best place in Leslieville for brunch on the weekends, lunch during the week. Unfortunately its no longer a secret and the lineups are ridiculous. I'd definitely say its worth the wait but I just can't line up for food anymore, hence not getting in there as often as I would like."}
{"text":"Long wait but well worth it. The food was amazing. I had the cheddar and spinach waffles with bacon. Delicious and full of savory flavor!!"}
{"text":"Oh, my, god. I love the food here. It's so tasty. The atmosphere is great. It is well worth the wait. It's a perfect breakfast spot, so cutely decorated with vintage plates and great decor. I wish I lived in Toronto, just so I could eat here every week. Great vegan options. Love, love, love. Heaven."}
{"text":"Prepare to wait in line if you plan on showing up later than 10am, overall excellent service but I wish the place was a bit larger. Some tables were too close to the entrance.. kind of makes you feel like customers who are waiting are too close to you. But overall excellent experience there, the food is great and I definitely recommend it if you want a great brunch in a homey feel atmosphere. I'm sure the staff won't mind that you show up in your sunday PJs ;P"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the city. On weekends, come early or you'll be waiting for a long time. Amazing and unique dishes - where else can you get cheddar and spinach waffles or Brie Avocado and Bacon eggs Benny???"}
{"text":"This is a tag team review with my yelpin-girl Christine C. !!!

This place induced a foodgasm for me. Loved the huevos. Loved them. I can't wait to go back and have them again.

My latte was not that great, but I wasn't there for the coffee. They did have brown sugar instead of regular granular white sugar. This wins extra bonus points for me. 

I normally like pretty, modern, clean places. But, as Christine said - this resto is like going into your aunt's place to have brekkie, and it was perfect. The table and chairs reminded me of my childhood. I am also a HUGE fan of when businesses showcase local art. That always touches my heart and wins big points. 

Our waitress was fantastic. Super friendly, seemed genuinely happy to be working there and so eager to help me get some caffeine into my system. 

I also like how you can see into the kitchen. It was a clam, orderly chaos back there. This orderly system produced the most perfectly cooked scrambled eggs with chorizo (who doesn't love sausage?!). The refried beans were amazing....all in all...I will be back, for sure! 

If you want to feel comfy, like you are wrapped in a snuggie (WTF is that thing?!) and being fed by wonderful friendly people, do yourself a favour and go here! But...call me first to join you!!!"}
{"text":"Just hit up Lady Marmalade for the 3rd time and I'm still impressed. I'm trying to make it a point to order something different each time because everything on the menu looks so good. The problem is, once you try something you want to go back and have it again...I really wanted the brie & avacado benny because it's to die for; but I decided to stick to my guns and try something different. So, today I had the Huevos Rancheritos. Wow. The scrambled eggs were fluffy & delicious, with cheese & a nice chipotle salsa (although, i did mind the salsa more on the saucy side). The smashed black beans were heavenly, as was the guac. So good...still thinking about how good it was! I also had the homemade lemonade and it was just tart enough!

If you're in the mood for something a little less breakfast-y, you must try the spinach salad w/ carmelized apple, squash, beets, blue cheese w/ a balsamic vinaigrette. It may actually be one of the best salads ever. The flavour combinations are ridiculously complimentary. 

I expect it will be rare to find Lady Marmalade without a line up, but it's definitely worth the wait...and while you're waiting, pop over to the bank machine to grab cash because Lady Marmalade is currently cash only!"}
{"text":"The line out the front door and onto the sidewalk hints at how good this place is. If you are willing to wait, or if you come early enough to beat the inevitable line, you will be rewarded with one delicious breakfast. Using locally sourced or organic ingredients, they create wonderful breakfasts in a fun, friendly atmosphere.
We had the huevos migas - fabulous and filling! and the brie-avocado-bacon benny - fantastic! I thoroughly enjoyed every bite, and I am looking forward to coming back!
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Okay.  NOW.

Just like 5 Yelps say - \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"

I cannot agree more.  Easily the best breakfast I've had in the city, and one of the best I've ever had.  Hope that conveys my enthusiasm :P

The food was incredible.  The coffee was absolutely spot on.  And the crushed rasberry lemon iced tea was perfect.

I seriously can't stop thinking about this place.  Oh and there was no line-up when we got there at 12pm on Saturday.  Place was full, but were able to catch a table that left as soon as we arrived.  

GO!  *Drooly face*"}
{"text":"ok so i went back to try out the poutine.. and to read some more hardy boys!! lol

well i guess what i was envisioning for the poutine is not what arrived on my plate. 

first off let me say the waitress there is great.. i must try to remember her name better! lovely girl :0) so i wanted to clarify what miso gravy was.. i first thought of miso soup at a sushi place! i was correct in my thought process. so she suggested getting it on the side in case i didn't like it. smart move! i did not like the gravy. 

for some reason i was envisioning hash brown like potato fries.. they were literally home fries.. with the cheese melted on top.. so i paid $7.50 to eat that, so i was disappointed with that.. 

so i will stick to the breakfast items."}
{"text":"Your aunt's kitchen
that is the best I can describe it.

This is a good place with good consistency.  Probably a 3 star place but the decor and chipper service add a star.  I would make this a regular place if I found myself in the neighbourhood more often.
Other than that, I have to admit, for a place that is called, \"Lady Marmalade\"..their actual Marmalade is sub-par."}
{"text":"An experience that exceeds the hype! You just love to see that.  A shorter wait than the line initially suggested, we were seated quickly, service was fast and friendly and the feel was homely.  None of that matters however when you're serving the hands down best brunch in town; it's just a nice bonus!"}
{"text":"This place has all the hype and very little follow-through.  When the food is fresh it's top-notch, but that doesn't seem to happen too often, unfortunately.  I've been plenty of times and today will be my last.  The last 5-6 times my food (and my dining companions) has arrived cold, clearly sitting out for 10-15 minutes.  Today the same thing happened.  I also ordered the smoked salmon benny and the the amount of salmon that was given was pathetic.  It was sliced super thin (which I like) but didn't cover even half of the surface of the english muffin half.  You couldn't taste it at all.  I know smoked salmon is more expensive, but this was basically the equivalent of serving a roast beef sandwich with one slice of roast beef.  Ridiculous.  It's also served with home fries, and there were 7 of them.  For a $15.50 breakfast, that's really unacceptable.  Our server was great though!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try and I finally feel fulfilled with brunch! I ordered orange juice and it came in a normal sized glass -- that's right folks, no mini glasses around here. The service was prompt and friendly - my friend had her coffee refilled about 3 times over the course of 45 minutes. 

THE BENNYS THE BENNYS!!!! They came with delicious potatoes and a refreshing small salad. They hollandaise sauce is light and enjoyable with a lemony taste. The pulled pork benny was tasty - seasoned but not too hot. But the real winner was the bacon, avocado and brie benny. It was to die for.

This brunch spot definitely lived up to the hype - in fact, it went beyond the hype. BUT - there's a but - it is EXTREMELY busy and usually there is a line up down the block. We came on a Tuesday at 11am and got a seat but a crabby line grew behind us while we were seated. Be prepared to wait but it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a rainy day - thankfully we missed the lineup that started soon after we arrived.  This place is clearly popular, even on a weekday.

Service was friendly and efficient.  Food was pretty good - I had the croque monsieur crepe which I didn't really like and my friend had the cheddar/spinach waffles which were excellent.

Would love to come back and try some more things on the menu.  I don't come out this far east very often so it was a nice change.  Next time, I'm probably gonna go for those waffles.."}
{"text":"So so good! My partner and I were in town for work and found this place on yelp and it did not disappoint!! I had the brie cheese eggs Benedict which was amazing. Super friendly service, cool atmosphere, and very friendly service! Cash only but there's a TD bank next door!"}
{"text":"Came on a busy Sunday morning around 10:45AM. There were about 6 couples ahead of us which made the wait about 15mins until we got seated.  

Ordered the Eggs Benny with Brie, avocado and bacon. Took about 25mins for the food to arrive though. The English muffin was nicely toasted and the rest tasted really good. 

The waitress was really friendly and overall I would recommend coming here for a great breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:

I have come here three times over the past couple of years and I have to say...I don't get the hype of this place. It's not terrible but it's not special either. They do have a number of gluten-free items on the menu. In my latest visit I got the A.M. Poutine with pulled pork. It was good, but it was definitely not real poutine by any means. It was cubed potatoes, melted cheese and pulled pork. It tasted fine, but it was definitely not worth standing in line for. 

While I do think this place is over hyped, it is reassuring to know there are a number of gluten-free items on the menu. So really the reason I go here is when friends want to cross off \"standing in line for lady marmalade\" off their bucket list, or I'm out of other options for gluten-free brunch places to go to. 

That being said, the staff are lovely and the atmosphere is warm and cosy.

TL;DR several gluten-free items but nothing super special"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I found this restaurant by accident. We were pleasantly surprise. The service was grest and the food was amazing! I had the croque monsieur pancake. The prices are also resonable.  Careful cash only! Only negative is the coffee."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast; dare I say, perfection? I had a difficult time deciding what to eat, as the breakfast menu here really spoke to me. I went with the Benny topped with Brie, bacon and avocado, and was most impressed. Poaching a perfect egg is something not many breakfast restaurants do well, but they do it with finesse here. I love a place that respects the egg! Their hollandaise was a bright yellow color, due, no doubt, to the lovely deep color of the egg yolks. It was also seasoned perfectly, as was everything on the plate. You will get a side salad and some oven roasted potatoes with any Benny, and these delighted as well. They use one of my favorite dressings on their greens, the classic Asian ginger and soy sauce, so that made me happy. Yum, yum, yum! I'll be skipping lunch. The coffee was  very good, and service was efficient and friendly. There are only a dozen or so tables here, and the place was almost full by 9:00 on a week day, so arrive early and hungry. And congrats to this place on getting voted the best breakfast restaurant 2015 in Now Toronto!"}
{"text":"My all-time fave place to go when splurging on a great breakfast. Unfailingly great waitstaff, and perfect, delicious, interesting food every single time. There is a daily bread-pudding... Always to die for. We love the hot apple cider when it's chilly out, and the apple beet ginger juice when it's hot. Their bennys are perfect, and I LOVE the crepe croque Madame.  I've been here dozens of times and not once been disappointed. Go on a weekday to avoid the inevitable weekend line up."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Living in the beaches for years, with friends in Leslivile, I've seen line ups out side this resturant many times and wondered what it was all about so my friend and I checked it out on Sunday.  We got there, and there was a small line up.  My friend and I waited about 20minutes so that wasn't too bad.  We were kind of glad we didn't invite our other friend as it would have been allot longer for a bigger table.  We sat down and the waitress was very nice.  She was very informed about the menu and answered all our questions.  We ordered and soon after the food came out.  I had the  cheddar & spinach waffles, which I really liked. My friend had some eggs bennies (which he said was good) which came with potatoes (kind of like home fries).  My friend noticed the potatoes were cold and requested a new fresh hot batch.  The server seemed a little annoyed about it but brought out some more.  My friend discovered there was coffee grinds in his cup once he got to the bottom.  Another server, refilled his coffee, looked in the cup and poured anyways.  A new cup would have been nice.  To end it I got some apple crisp, before ordering I asked how was it, was it crispy?  was it brown sugary?  She said ya and said there was lots of butter and it was sweet.  It came and it was yummy but there was no crisp to it.  Normally, on a Apple Crisp desert, there would be a some oatmeal on top and it toasted to be crispy, but there was none.   It was more like apple pie without the crust.  I told the server I liked it but mentioned it was not crispy, her response was that next time maybe it could be under the broiler more.  Not sure that would have helped  as there was not crisp/oatmeal to crisp up.  The server really didn't care about, her tone and attitude was like she was thinking, her shit don't smell.  Oh well.  The space was crowed and a bit nosey.  Their only taking cash rule, no credit or debit is a little also a little odd.  Would I go back? sure why not."}
{"text":"Granted I haven't been to every single brunch spot in Toronto, this would have to be my favourite for food, the service was good, not mind blowingly amazing but definitely good enough especially given the fact that the line up outside since we came on what I would imagine is the busiest day...Sunday. I'm OK lining up for food especially for one that is this good. And even if the line was a horrible experience, that's in no way a reflection of Lady Marmalade. We did have a lady pull over in a truck and shout at the line in general about what was going on, when she heard it was a restaurant she just drove away looking very puzzled. So I guess not everyone has heard about the lady yet.....(I don't know if anyone refers to this place as \"the lady\" but I just did). 

While in line, I took to yelp to see if it could help sway me with deciding what to get since most of the menu stood out to me as \"oo I want that one!\" after browsing for a few I decided to go for the much raved about eggs benedict with avocado and brie. Ended up being a great choice so thank you yelp for yet another fantastic reco! The food was just great, the eggs were perfectly runny and everything was just great. My brunch date got the huevos rancheritos, I'm not the biggest fan of Mexican food so in my mind I chose the better dish, but she still loved her selection. I got black coffee, that got refilled once (which was enough) and she had a delicious OJ with what tasted like lime in there too?

Overall, this place is definitely worth a wait...we were in line for around 40 - 50 minutes I think. But it's not like I had any other plans, but for repeat visits I would definitely try to come back on a day that's not the official day for brunch in the city."}
{"text":"Every time I call to order food for pick up they say they are busy. I know on there website it says \"

Take Out

We will accept take out orders when we are able. Serving the customers in the restaurant is our priority. If we have a line-up we will not accept a take-out order. No take out orders on weekends. Thank you for your understanding.\"

You might as well take it off your website as you seem to be always busy. Which is great. 

But how come you cant make a sandwich for take out. is it that hard to do that?
I guess the kitchen cant handle it. How long dose it take to make a sandwich, i bet people sit in the restaurant longer then it takes to make. The restaurant is so small that they should be able to handle it. 
I would be walking to the restaurant to pick up, so regardless I would be in the restaurant. 
whats one more sandwich to make.? Its not that hard to make.
I guess they don't need to make money."}
{"text":"This place is probably the best breakfast place I've been to in downtown Toronto for a while. It's got street parking options but note: They do not take reservations (even on a Friday morning). The line up is outside (so dress warm) and there's barely any room to line up inside. You'll find yourself (if you're eating) being eyed down by the people waiting for a table. 

But this place has earned their way to the top to be able to say no to resos. 

Drink: Freshly squeezed Grapefruit Juice was not too sour/bitter. It was just right. I asked for a straw and was told they don't give them out due to consciousness of the environment. They won points. 

Huevos Migas: This melted in my mouth. The eggs were done so well and the right mix of sour cream, black refried beans and chips with salsa. I wasn't crazy about the rice (who eats rice for breakfast?). 

Ask for the house-made hot sauce. It is incredible! I also asked for some hollandaise sauce on the side which I dipped my pita chips in. 

Customer service was great! Our server was Jade/Jane and she was friendly. This is a hipster type of place... very casual yet classy... all in one. =)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fun, delicious brunch hang out, try here.

- Awesome food, they garnish everything with green onion
- Unique flavours in food, everything is cranked up to the tens
- Great prices for Breakfast food that's unique
- Fun atmosphere and decor (they sell local artist works in the restaurant)

All in all, worth the trek to Leslieville for a nice morning in the hood.  The neighbourhood has lots to offer (little furniture shops, specialty food shops).  The staff is friendly.  The vibe is cool.  Prices reasonable.  Highly recommended.

Tip: 
- May need to wait for a while, waited 45 minutes the first time I went there, then 15 the next, so make sure you give yourself some waiting time and not be so hungry you want to eat your own hand.
- Try their bread pudding french toast and their fresh home-made jam, it's unlike any breakfast food you've tried and it's DEE-LICOUS!"}
{"text":"A perfect blend of the kitschy and trendy Lady Marmalade has scored BIG with the Leslieville Brunch crowd.  As others have noted it has the definite feel of being in ones favourite Aunt's place, for me it was eerily reminiscent of being in my grandmothers kitchen circa 1988, yeah I'm dating myself...But there is a definite level of comfort as soon as you walk through the doors here.  It can feel a tad crowded during peak hours, but I guess this is just the price that we must pay when frequenting a top tier Brunch spot.  

Service is relatively quick, yet fluid.  You never feel that you are being rushed by staff, but furtive glances and somewhat hushed angry tones of waiting patrons who are forced to endure your brunching ritual will certainly let you know if you have overstayed your welcome.  I personally witnessed an angry Vegan go to pull out the chair from a young woman that seemed to be meandering a bit past her date of expiration.

The food is decidedly good.  I have had both the bacon bennie and the huevos rancheritos, the latter was the better option, yet the lemony kick in the former almost sold me on the bennie, but my taste buds cannot argue with chipotle salsa, guacamole and the smashed beans that accompany the racheritos.  Anytime I can have guacamole in anything, or with anything I'm almost 100% sold.  Everything else just has to be merely edible.  Not that anything at LM can be referred to as \"merely edible\" mind you."}
{"text":"I've been curious about Lady Marmalade for some time now, but I am not interested in queuing for an hour. I had the opportunity to come on a Thursday morning with a friend, and yet there was still a line! Thankfully the wait was only about 20 minutes. 

Getting in:
One of the servers greeted us as we walked in, there were 3 groups ahead of us.  She asked \"how many\", and asked us to wait outside, since it was a bit cramped. Fine... except there was another group that had walked in and stood in line inside and essentially cut in front of us. Well... it didn't impact the wait much since the table turn over was decently quick, but does it really hurt to take names down to maintain a sequence? 

The Meal:
Coffee was very good - no complaints. 
I ordered the Huevos Roncheritos (with poached eggs), and my friend ordered the Huevos Migas. I will say, the food is very good! My friend is South American, and she said it tasted home made. I feel like the Roncheritos was heavy on the beans, and I would have liked 2 eggs instead of 3, and a bit more tomato sauce. That's just my preference... the food was very good. 


Overall:
Given the demand, I found the space to be underwhelming. Dated diner-style furniture with simple art on the wall... it looked a little lacking. I am a bit puzzled as to why there are so many people lined up outside for brunch...
The food is good... but you can get equally good food, and maybe even better ambience elsewhere with little to no wait time. 

I'd love to come back here... although I am not sure how I feel about waiting in line."}
{"text":"Although the wait time can sometimes be long at Lady Marmalade, it is definitely worth it for they definitely have the best eggs benedict in town!! I love to build my own eggs benedict, with black forrest ham, brie, and avocado. When you bite into it, the rich creaminess fills your mouth, it just tastes heavenly. Then I wash down the bits of heaven with some freshly squeezed orange juice. I wish I can eat brunch here more often. Sigh..."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and huge line up. It was small inside. I had the Moroccan Scramble and it was good, nothing special. I wouldn't come back here as the lines are always long and not worth it for me. If the food was worth it, I would wait but it was just ok."}
{"text":"Stop the bus.....screeeech. You mean to tell me I haven't written a review for my favorite brunch joint in the city. Woah Nelly. I hope the brunch gods can forgive me for this slip up.

Lady Marmalade is the most wonderful mish mash of  non matching chairs and tables, young and spirited service with a smile, a warm collective ambiance and Food Glorious Food; served from a kitchen quartet who bring a whole new meaning to brunch. 

Get there early. Or try to figure out their turn overs. 10am and 12pm seem to be safe times to show up where you'll be seated in no more than 10 minutes. Service in quick, attentive and helpful. Coffee comes served in a cup which is sure to remind you of one of your grandmothers pieces. My boyfriend raves about this cup o joe. The menu has an assortment of options. Everything from your usual eggs/bacon/potato to creative bennies to crepes served in nest form to your mexican favorites and some classics turned onto their head. They also serve lunch offerings. 

Must Tries:
The Bennies - May the brunch gods hear my testament...the 'lady' serves the best bennies in the city. I've had the Brie and Avacado and Fresh Tomatoe and Pesto. Each comes with a side of nicely spiced potatoes and a generous mixed salad with a tasty asian sesame dressing. YUM. 

Aged White Cheddar and Spinach Waffles - I never imagined eating my waffles on the savory side of the track. Holy Moly. These were unreal. Dressed with  a smokey tomato orange cream sauce and topped with scallions and avocado (I swapped the bacon).  I didn't only write home about this dish...I wrote to the whole damn choir! I've got this savoury tune stuck in my head and I the only cure is to replay the whole experience. 

Don't forget Lady Marmalade only accepts cash."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the wait. The place seems to draw a crowd, and there is almost always a line,no matter what day of the week.  The food is just average, nothing special at all."}
{"text":"My long overdue visit  and man have I been missing out. I could drink that Hollandaise sauce it's so good. The bacon was perfect, just the right amount of crunch but still soft enough to cut through. The potatoes and salad are perfect sides to this dish. In all honesty though, I could have gone without the Brie, not because I don't like Brie but because I forgot it was there. Didn't taste it at all. I will definitely come back again to try their other dishes. Be warned, when they say the house made Habanero sauce is spicy, they mean it. 

With all brunch places that are more well known, expect a line."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The best brunch I've had in the city so far. The mango eggs benny is unreal."}
{"text":"How to describe this place accurately?? Amazing... This was my first time in Toronto. And this Restaurant was the star of the trip. My review will be solely about my breakfast plate. Ive ordered the Cochinita Pibil Benny.... Now I usually try to stay away from eating Mexican food at Restaurants since my family cooks it perfectly. However to my surprise this Benny (I got used to calling it that way now) was outstanding.. The cochinita was seasoned on point actually and believe me they will give some Mexican Restaurants a run for their money on how good it was... The purple onions great.. And that habanero sauce was to die for. The rest of the Benny was just perfect Hollandaise sauce delicious... Poached eggs on point. But as funny as it may sound to me .. What blew me away was the potatoes... OMG.. Best potatoes ever and trust me I had tons and this right now are my all time favorite.. The coffee was excellent.. Service well what can you say its Canada.  Even when the place was packed and loud.. Believe its worth the wait. Kudos to all the staff here you have an amazing thing going on.. Cant wait to go back your place and enjoy something else. Thank you and yes its a must when in Toronto. Merci!"}
{"text":"Came back for brunch with some food loving friends on a Sunday morning. It was 10:30am and there was already a line up out the door. 

it's first come first served, and only sitting your party when everyone is there. We were 6 people, and we had to wait until one big table had opened up. I think the wait was about an hour. 

While we were waiting, they gave us coffee. I thought it would be free, but it wasn't. 

The food makes up for it. It's so delicious. And lots of options to choose from. The menu has selections that are vegan / veggie friendly.  I would suggest a benny option over the croque mousieur, although very good. The hollendaise sauce is one of the best i've ever had. 

I always found it interesting that $2.50 for a coffee and $3.50 for a tea is a little steep, but it is bottomless, and you could get 3-4 cups out of it, and they come by frequently.

With our group of 6, gratuity was included and everything was about $18 pp. With tons of people waiting, it was hard to chit chat, but there are so many cafes down the street to move to!"}
{"text":"There is a reason that Lady Marmalade always has a line, it is a great brunch that is tasty and prepared fresh for you!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The pulled pork sandwich with avacado was spot on. The ambience and price points are hard to beat. Perfect on sat mornings. Come early to avoid line ups. Bring cash... they dont take cards."}
{"text":"Had to wait a little bit for a seat on a Monday but totally worth it. Had the Huevos Migas and it was totally delicious would definitely come back here again"}
{"text":"First time here and really enjoyed it. Very cute place with a nice open space. 

Had the huevos rancheritos + coffee, friend had two poached eggs with avocado.

Huevos were great. Three eggs, guacamole, black beans, and a softish crunchy tortilla. Also had their house made habanero hot sauce which was delicious.

Two eggs comes with toast, potatoes, and salad. Really good amount of food. 

A few different things on the menu looked delicious. They also had sandwiches and salads as opposed to more traditional breakfast food. Daily specials on soup and bread pudding available. 

But far from my usual areas geographically but would definitely go back. 

FYI Cash only."}
{"text":"We got eggs benedict with avocado, bacon and brie with a mango lasi. It was amazing and we did not wait long for a table. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the east end of the better part of a decade now, and I only tried Lady Marmalade for the first time ever last week.  I'm a bit anti-queue, even though a lengthy line-up usually means that something special is waiting beyond the anxious crowd.  However, I found myself with an ultra-rare weekday off (I don't have the guts or patience to try for a weekend) and decided it was finally time to give Lady Marmalade a go.

First discovery - this place is jumping, even on a weekday.  We arrived around 10:30AM and got the last table-for-two that was available (and the ever-ubiquitious lineup began to form shortly thereafter).  Service is friendly but quick and to-the-point, because they are obviously trying to move as many plates as they possibly can to keep up with the throng of people who just want to get their breakfast on.

I opted for the bread pudding, and the husband ordered the breakfast poutine.  We were served our food within minutes of placing our orders, and the serving sizes were hearty and filling.  The food was good.  I mean, it wasn't as incredible as I had expected given the hype, but it was still good.  The bread pudding wasn't really what I had expected, given that they indicate on the menu that the dish is their interpretation of french toast.  Don't get me wrong, it was very delicious (I ordered the lemon-raspberry variety), but other than being served with maple syrup, it didn't really scream FRENCH TOAST to me.  Plus, the maple syrup felt like a bit of an unnecessary afterthought to make a dessert dish seem more breakfast-y.  The raspberry coulis on top spoke for itself, and I wouldn't have missed the syrup had it never appeared on my plate.

It's pretty inexpensive for a nice brunch, which is nice considering it is a cash-only establishment.  And given the perpetual crowd, I imagine it's not the kind of breakfast place where you can get away with ordering free refills of coffee and gab away the day.  As soon as we were finished, the bill arrived, was paid, and we were out the door within 30 minutes.  Not quite what I had expected.

Overall, everything was fine.  There wasn't anything particularly spectacular about the food or the service, it was just fine.  Nothing to really rant OR rave about, and definitely not enough to encourage me to start braving the weekend line-up."}
{"text":"How on Earth does one decide what to order when everything sounds so stupid good? It was a painful painful experience narrowing down to one option...but since I was eating with my sister we got to do a little sharing! Score.

As has been stated- there will be a wait. I suggest you get in line.  The line moves quick, they know how to turn tables...make sure you stop at a cash station because they ain't messing around with any plastic.

We ordered up some coffee (for sure real good) and the A.M. poutine with the miso gravy and poached eggs. As well as the pulled pork benedict. I don't know how they do it but their poached eggs are glorious. The most perfect yolks.... blows my mind. 

Service was prompt and efficient and offered plenty of refills on coffee. When I return I will have to try a French toast or one of their specials but I don't know how I will be able to pass up a dish with those poached eggs."}
{"text":"The wait was long but well worth it! I went with a group of friends and most of us got the egg benedict. When you first cut into it, the egg yolk oozed out over the braised beef. The daily special was very flavourful and tender. They were very generous on the beef too! The pulled pork benny with avocado added was lighter in flavour but equally as good. I finished it wanting to try more on their menu even though I was stuffed!"}
{"text":"We really wanted to try this restaurant for the fact that it uses sustainably sourced ingredients. Our 3rd attempt to visit this place which ended up being the poorest customer service we've ever experienced!!! It's understandable that the kitchen closes at a specific time, but when you have guests waiting in line to be sat, (and in our case waited nearly 15 minutes) and you tell them they can't be served because the kitchen closes soon and you don't allow customers to order in line...that is the epitome of poor customer service and lack of care and concern for your patrons period! It would have been acceptable if we were told upon entering the establishment, but to let us wait nearly 15 minutes...especially with a child...and refuse us service??? You never, ever, under any circumstance turn away customers who have been waiting due to your lack of diligence. And from what I was told it's the restaurants policy to turn guests away!!! It's appalling and is clear that management doesn't value their customers. Do yourself a favor and take your money to restaurants that appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriends's favorite brunch spot. Eclectic but charming. Always a line up out the door. Expect at least half an hour on Sunday mornings but worth it. Coffee is tasty. One of the best eggs Benny I've had in town. Get here soon."}
{"text":"Had brunch with my mom at this place for the very first time and I absolutely loved it! Such a great way to start the new year :) happy 2016 ppl!"}
{"text":"Excellent little brunch place!!!! Definitely get the Eggs Benny, which are included on most platters anyway. The portions are large. Just what you need for a morning after drinking. 

The wait can get long depending on when you go. I waited for a good 30 minutes and this was with a short line. But that just shows the place is excellent."}
{"text":"Line up was pretty fast, about 20 mins. Great little spot for brunch. Small menu but packed with flavor. We had the Huevos and a plain Benedict with avocado. Super delicious and generous servings. The refried beans were spectacular and the tortilla was soft and flaky, so amazing. The Benedict was on point and potatoes were crunchy and golden. Definitely worth a visit even with the line."}
{"text":"Awesome egg bennies, probably the best i've ever had. I tried one of the signature egg Benedict  with bacon, Brie and avocado. The egg was cooked just right where the yolk gushes out. The hollandaise sauce was out of this world. It had a spice kick to it which made it different from the other hollandaise sauce. I also had the bread pudding for dessert. It was soft and flavourful. The maple syrup severed on the side was in a jar which I thought was kind of cute. Overall I would definitely come back. I would also recommend coming either really early or later after 1:30 to get a table as there is no reservations on the weekend. It is a first come first serve basis."}
{"text":"I loved Lady Marmalade so much!! The food was absolutely delicious and definitely worth a little bit of a wait at the beginning. The line did move quickly and I felt as though the servers were very attentive and quick to help us order without it feeling rushed. The space is cozy and very cute and it has really wonderful food. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are in the Toronto area. If it's on a weekend, prepare for a bit of a wait outside. Other than that - everything about this place was perfect!"}
{"text":"I had which I believe was the only \"no red meat\" friendly option from their Eggs Bennie section of the menu. The \"Roast Vegetables\" version, and I wasn't disappointed. 

The Lemony but smooth hollandaise sauce (with a hint of paprika?) was terrific. You'll wanna scrape that off the plate rather than let it go to waste. The roasted vegetables themselves (especially the tomato) have a very apparent and strong but enjoyable flavor. Usually I find you can't really taste anything that comes with roasted veggies, but this was different. I would compare the difference in flavour intensity to that between a tomato and a sun dried tomato.

It came with a side of leafy greens which I think will help you get through this heavy, but easy to devour brunch

Expect a line up when you arrive, and I'd say expect to get seated much quicker if its just you and one other."}
{"text":"Went their with my husband on a rainy Sunday. We lined up and got a seat pretty quickly. I'm giving two stars first because you can't make substitution. I took the moroccan scrambled, it was saggy, too much spices mixed together to give the illusion of moroccan taste. It was heavy and not tasty at all. Also you must specify that it's spicy hot, moroccan food are not supposed to be spicy hot at all. Don't think I will renew the experience there."}
{"text":"Went here early in a Saturday morning. Had to be in a line up for about 20-25 mins but the wait was well worth it. The service was quick and efficient, servers polite and smiling and never rushing. Specialty coffees are amazing. Eggs Benedict are a class apart. Overall an outstanding experience and the crowd does not compromise the quality of the food. I would go again."}
{"text":"Great brunch place! Had the eggs Benny with salmon, poutine with poached eggs and huevos rancheros. All 3 were awesome! Cappuccino was decent too. Would recommend."}
{"text":"After seeing all the reviews online, I was dying to check out lady marmalade and my expectations were blown out of the water. 

By far the best brunch that I've ever had in the city - and I'm a huge 'bruncher'. The eggs Benny is an absolute must. It's just the best of everything - including the hollandaise which is so buttery that it practically melts in your mouth. 

The only downside to this place is the wait. We probably waited a solid 45 minutes for a table, and then some for the food. First outside. Then inside. The line moved ever so slow, and I think it has to do with the campers (aka people who won't leave, despite not buying any more food or drinks) in this place or servers that just aren't turning tables fast enough. I did notice that there weren't a lot of staff to help with the flow of service (expo, bussing, hostessing). The servers were literally running the restaurant so kudos to you. I have some serious respect for servers who can do it all. But, that's probably why we waited so long in the line. We were already hungry when we got there, and leslieville is not close. So to wait another hour just to get sat and get some good food is sometimes unrealistic. 

However I would come back if the wait wasn't as long. So good."}
{"text":"This place is heaven on earth. My wife and I flew in from New York and this was our first experience in Toronto. I had the cheddar and spinach waffle. Best waffle I had ever. There was a line to get in but its all worth it. I will recommend this place to all my friends visiting Toronto"}
{"text":"I seriously would like to know why this place has all these good reviews and a line up????!!!! We decided to try this place for a weekend brunch, got there around 9:30 and was seated right away. First of all, the main problem was the smell. Burning oil... eeeww... I had to go out and get some fresh air. They definitely need to have a better exhaust hood. 

We ordered a Benny ( Brie, Avocado & bacon), a Poutine with eggs, Grapefruit juice and an apple cider, 1 tea and 1 coffee. Paid $50, I think it was very expensive for what we had.
Both dishes were so below average, I should say I had much much much better egg benedict in Toronto and way cheaper. The 1 star is only for the Juices we had. They were ok. Service was nothing special. Menu is very limited! Even the name doesn't match what they serve...  

I had to go back home and washed all my cloths as I was smelling like burnt oil. Took my coat for dry cleaning. It was very disgusting! Overall, we were very disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place had so much promise, I was aware of the possibility of waiting in line as it is a very busy cafe. When I looked inside and noticed how people were sat I was disappointed, this cafe is not using its seating arrangements to their full potential. 1 person on a 4 seater or 2 on a 4 just didn't make sense. Once I was inside the door and able to tell the waitress I was one they allowed me to share with the single person on the 4 person table.
The food was amazing! It speaks for its self, service was ok but the food eggs beni was spot on.
During my dining I also extended the offer for another single to join as I didn't need the whole table. She was in shock and very thankful.
Please look at how you sit people, if your cafe is as popular as all sites are saying you need to get more people in and use your tables to their full potential."}
{"text":"Always a great time when I come here with my friends.  

It's such a popular joint for brunch however, you may have to wait quite a while to snag a seat.  Your entire party needs to be there before you will be seated as well. 

My huevos rancheros were to die for. A home made habanero hot sauce was the kicker.   I highly recommend this dish.  

My friends both had different dishes, but I was too wrapped up in mine to notice what they had.  That being said, both of them swore it was the best breakfast they have ever had."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had brunch like this before. It was an interesting experience, and I wouldn't mind repeating it, but I also don't really understand the hype of it. My meal was certainly tasty, but I don't know whether it warranted no reservations and lining up on a slightly rainy day. For whatever reason, I expected Lady Marmalade to be more upscale. It had more of a diner feel to it. That being said, birthday brunch with two birthday girls at the table was fun! We ordered 4 dishes between 3 people. Perhaps that wasn't the best idea. I had a taste of the A.M poutine, and got the huevos rancheritos for myself. 

We got the miso gravy with the A.M. poutine. The baked hashbrowns in the dish were more liked roasted potatoes. They were not small pieces either. There weren't many cheese curds, and the ones that were there were stuck together. The miso gravy turned out quite nicely though. It did have a distinctly miso flavor to it.

I got poached eggs with my huevos rancheritos. Mine were nice and runny. My friend's pulled pork benny poached eggs were less so, unfortunately. My huevos rancheritos came with 3 eggs, cheese, chilies, salsa, guacamole, black beans, and an organic wheat tortilla. I couldn't find much cheese or chilies, but there were a whole lot of black beans. I'm assuming the idea is to use the tortilla to scoop up everything else. If so, I needed a lot more tortilla than just one. The tortilla was also sitting next to my salsa-topped eggs, and the wetness from the salsa made the bottom of my tortilla soggy. The flavor combinations on that plate were quite lovely, and quite fresh. Still too many beans though. The guac was yum. Lots of avocado. I wouldn't mind ordering the huevos rancheritos again, but next time, I'd probably get the salsa on the side.

The food didn't wow me, but the company was great! I can't wait for my next brunch adventure with the girls!"}
{"text":"Came here for birthday brunch with my hubby. This place is so busy. Thankfully the lineup outside moves pretty fast as we were seated within 20 minutes.

We ordered freshly squeezed grapefruit juice and a honey ginger tea, both of which were great. After perusing the menu and asking the waiter for recommendations, hubby decided on the huevos migas and I ordered the simple eggs Benedict with ham. 

The food was served relatively quickly and everything was tasty and well seasoned. The hollandaise was the right consistency of creaminess and the eggs were perfectly poached. I appreciated the gluten free options (for a small fee). For those who like heat, they have a homemade habanero sauce (also available for purchase).

If you're looking for a great place to have breakfast/brunch with friends or loved ones, I would definitely recommend Lady Marmalade but come early or be prepared to wait!

{"text":"While I stood in a massive queue to get into this place, I was cursing myself. I don't wait in long lines unless there's a shiny new iPhone waiting for me at the end of it -- and even then, that pretty much fills up my queuing quota for the next year. I hate the way this cafe makes people stand in line instead of taking down names on a piece of paper. However, turnover is fairly quick; once you get seated and place your order, your food is going to come out in less time than you'd expect for a trendy place like this. 

The eggs benny with bacon was perfect. Creamy Hollandaise with just the right touch of lemony flavor, crisp bacon and a perfectly toasted English muffin (thank you, Lady Marmalade, for ensuring the muffin stayed crisp and not bogged down with too much sauce!). I love that this breakfast entree came with a fresh and lightly dressed side salad -- it gives me the illusion that the rest of my plate might be healthy. :)  The bread pudding style French Toast is excellent as well; sweet and VERY filling, but still custardy and not soggy. I also loved the house-made raspberry lemon iced tea -- fruity and perfect for a summer day! I could have drank ten of these.

They don't take credit or debit (cash only) and, as I've mentioned, I'm not a fan of the way they manage their peak hour breakfast queue. As a result, I'm probably not going to make this a regular place to visit unless I'm up early or if the pharmaceutical companies finally create a pill that increases patience, tolerance, and zen."}
{"text":"Random drop in before we headed out of town for a hike. It was early... most places weren't open yet and we were on the east side of the city (where I don't normally hang out). Yelp to the rescue and oh did it do well!

We walked in to the last two seats open and ordered the Crepe Croque Monsieur and Huevos Migas with coffee and a london fog.The food was delicious, eggs were perfect on the Huevos. The flavors were great and although a bit heavy in nature the fresh ingredients made up for it!

Place is nice, small but simple. The staff was friendly and definitely more awake than we were. We were in and out within 40 minutes! I would come back here to try another of their very exciting creations :)"}
{"text":"I always walk by this place on weekends when I go to downtown and the line up is always so long. So yesturday I had the opportunity to try this place out on a Tuesday at 10ish. There arent alot of tables in there so it was pretty full when I got there but there was one table left for us. They dont take reservations btw. We ordered the salmon and ham eggs benedict. The poached egg was perfect but I didnt think it was anything special. Everything came out fresh and hot. English muffin was toasted perfectly. Potatoes were nice and crispy, a little bit spicy as well. One thing to note is their salad which they used a vinegar seasme dressing which I found was really refreshing. I believe their ketchup is homemade as well. Service was good and staff were friendly. They only accept cash or debit though. The food is good but I dont think it is good enough for me to line up for lol."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and always delicious. The downfall is longer then usual wait times to get a table AND poor ventilation so you absolutely reek of food when you leave. A must try if you can get in and brave the line."}
{"text":"Lady Marmalade is a quaint, friendly breakfast restaurant that I was able to visit this past week. The coffee and food were delicious! I enjoyed their unique take on classic breakfast items. I ordered the bacon, cheddar and mango salsa egg benedict. The flavors were fabulous together. The eggs were cooked to perfection, as well as the bacon. The salsa was fresh and flavorful. I had the hollandaise sauce on the side and it was perfect for dipping! The potatoes were crispy and great with their homemade hot sauce. 

Overall, I highly recommend Lady Marmalade. The service was very friendly and prompt. The coffee was fresh, as well as my entree. A definite must in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday afternoon with my girlfriend after being recommended by a friend. 

We arrived at 2:40 knowing that they close at 3 and that the place was in-demand. Although there were two parties in front of us waiting to be seated, we were told that we 'may or may not' be seated before the kitchen closes at 3 but that we would be given some indication within the next 5 to 10 minutes. So we decided to stay until they told us it wasn't happening. 

Over the next 20 minutes, the two parties in front of us ended up being seated and the hostess returned to us three times letting us know that she's pushing tables along. Not once was it said that we probably wouldn't get a seat and that we should leave.

Meanwhile, two parties after us were turned away being told they wouldn't be seated. 

At 3pm, there were three tables paying for their meals yet we were told, at that very moment, that the kitchen had closed and that we wouldn't get a seat. 

I have never written a review on Yelp before but this experience prompted me to post one. 

After a party has waited 20 minutes for a table and was not told once to leave due to the likelihood of not being seated, you do not tell them to leave, especially as it's visible that parties are moments from vacating their tables. 

Service and expectation management was absolutely poor. Even though I have a few friends vouching for this place, this experience alone has made me NOT want to try it and make it a point to let others know. 

We ended up walking over to Bonjour Brioche just a few blocks west and had an excellent brunch there. The service, food and atmosphere was very pleasant and my girlfriend repeatedly described Bonjour Brioche as being cute and her favourite brunch spot in Toronto so far. 

If anything, I'd like to thank Lady Marmalade for turning us away as we were able to try Bonjour Brioche."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch with coworkers last week and enjoyed my meal/experience.

There was a surprisingly long line mid day so we waited about 15 minutes for a table. Not a big deal but worth noting that when you visit, plan for some possible wait time.

I ordered a housemade unsweetened iced tea and the spicy salmon sandwich was with side salad. Food was tasty, nicely prepared and fresh. Our server was polite and prompt. For those interested, there are many vegan/veggie friendly choices on the menu.

Would like to come back for brunch soon!"}
{"text":"Nice place with great service. Our waiter was super nice. I ordered the Florentine egg benedict with spinach. The food was good, not wow but just ok.
It seems to get very busy here, especially for brunch, so if you want to come here, I do recommend making some reservations."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service! The music was a bit loud for my hangover (don't judge me) and it was a bit pricey at 40 (incl tip, 2 breakfasts, OJ and coconut water) but still 5 stars because it was just so fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great food & great service! I came in on a Saturday morning and didn't have to wait for a table. They were accommodative to us while we had to wait for the last member of our group to arrive. Every option on the brunch menu looks and sounds delicious. I went with a classic pulled pork eggs benny. The eggs are probably the most fresh I've ever seen/tasted. You can tell by the colour of the yolk and these ones were a beautiful orangey-yellow. Any time you can get hash browns + a side salad on the side can never be a bad time! Overall really fun experience, just wish they had a bigger location!"}
{"text":"Love this little place in Queen East! Had their avocado, Brie and bacon eggs Benny, with their HOMEMADE hollandaise sauce and they were one my absolute favourites I've ever tasted. Great lattes and totally worth the line up on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"This place is always packed, expect to wait 10-45 minutes before being seated. I have been multiple times, and each time their food just blows my mind. Their eggs benny are absolutely amazing. The hollandaise sauce is spot on. Beware, if you order the bread pudding french toast, come with a large appetite or share with a friend, because it's HUGE! and very very heavy, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I tried to go on a Sunday around 1pm and the line up was so long out the door so we came back on a Tuesday. There was still a bit of a wait but not too bad (about 20 mins.) The service was super good and friendly. We got the eggs Benedict with brie, avocado and bacon and the pulled pork. The pulled pork was a really tasty and tender. The brie, avocado and bacon was good. Simple ingredients but everything was fresh and we'll prepared. The virgin Caesar was amazing. We asked for extra spicy and it delivered! We'll seasoned. I would recommend for a great brunch/lunch place but it is quite busy at all hours so avoid going if you're super hungry or your hanger may get the best of you!"}
{"text":"Make sure you come in pairs to faster seating, we made the rookie mistake coming in a group of 3 and waited just under 2 hours to be seated around 10:30am on a Saturday.  Not many brunches are worth that wait, and this one sure wasn't.    I got the eggs benny and it wasn't anything to write home about.  Not bad, but for that long of a wait, my expectations were higher. 

Lil Baci down the street has no line ups and the food is just as good."}
{"text":"3:40 pm on a beautiful Saturday afternoon and they are closed?  Queen street is packed with people.  This is crazy.  We walked a long ways along Queen Street and most of the restaurants are still serving brunch.  You can't order a drink and appetizer."}
{"text":"Get there early because they do get busy very quickly and there's a lineup. Also I had a salmon Benny and it was delicious, it was so good. The only thing was is that my potatoes were over cooked but other than that it was really really good and it has all happy positive vibes...the staff are very helpful for a cheerful and I loved it and I'm going back there today..."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Had salmon sandwich. Was good but not like mind blowing. Had crepe...same story. Friendly people though. Cash only!!!"}
{"text":"This is the spot for brunch in Leslieville. The food is top notch and there are 3-4 servers for a very small restaurant, meaning your coffee cup is always full. Even when the line is quite long to get in the turnaround is quick."}
{"text":"I really wanted to dislike Lady Marmalade. 

It's the stereotypical hipster hang out.  For most of us, waiting in line is a bad thing.  I walk past Lady Marmalade and see the hipsters putting themselves on display. I think they enjoy waiting in line.  It gives them a chance to put on a length public display of their tight pants, plunging V-necks, and so on, while they bounce all over the sidewalk, bumping into those of us who are unfortunate enough to be walking by.  

If there was a hipster pilgrimage, this place might be Mecca.

However,  the food is good.  It's very good.  It's consistently good.  The service is adequate.  I don't think I've had amazing service here, but I haven't had bad service either.  There's a reason for the line up here - it really is one of the best breakfast places around.  In a neighbourhood full of decent breakfast places, I think the food at Lady Marmalade gets top marks.  

I'd go here more, but it IS small, which makes the line situation worse.  I'm just not one to wait in a long line.  There are about 6 other breakfast options within walking distance.  If you want to go to Lady Marmalade and avoid a line, you need go first thing in the morning, or later in the afternoon.  Between 10:00 and 2:00 on the weekend, you could be looking at a 30 minute wait.

But yes, the food is good.  So grow that beard, put on that big wool hat in the summer, and head on down to Lady Marmalade.  Remember to Instagram your food."}
{"text":"Ugh this place. The food is all blobby, plopped on a plate and halfheartedly reheated. They dribbled some sauce all over my French toast that almost put me off my meal. The whole place is dark and dingy. The kicker was at the end of the meal me looking in my (dark colored) water glass and finding some undetermined sludge on the side that had been there the entire meal. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Wow, franchement √ßa vaut le d√©tour, mais faut essayer leurs sp√©cialit√©s. Le service est tr√®s bon et mon dieu, le Huevos Miga... Super excellent! On reviendra"}
{"text":"It's rare for me to rate a place 5 stars on the first try, but this place almost literally blew my socks off!

Be warned: they only accept cash and there's a chance you'll have to line up for a few minutes to get in. BUT it's totally worth it!! 

There were two of us here at around 10 on a Friday morning and it took us 15 minutes to be seated. 

The atmosphere is chilled out and everything has so much character, from the chairs to the mugs. 

The staff were incredibly nice, even though the place was packed and super busy, they were so polite and didn't rush to answer our questions. 

Well I guess I should talk about the food! We each ordered the Brie and avocado eggs Benedict, and it was hands down the best eggs Benny I've ever had in life! The hollandaise sauce was delicious, eggs cooked perfectly, English muffins were toasty and crisp, potatoes were super crispy but not burnt and the side salad was a great compliment to the meal! To top it off, their house hot sauce made with habanero was seriously amazing, everyone must try it! It was packed with flavour! 

I'd definitely come here again, it's worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"4.5 as well.

I felt like i was at a club waiting in line but nope...it's 11am and i am in line for brunch lol

It was worth it though because the food was amazing.  I ordered the Benni and damn....just damn.  the Hollandaise was nice a thick with a hint of lemon."}
{"text":"Yummy brunch spot. Visited on a Sunday afternoon in December  at 1:30 The wait was roughly 30 min. 

It is a smaller venue with fewer seating.

I ordered the poached blt my friend ordered the huevos migas. The wait for the food wasn't too long then again I was not timing. 

The poached blt was delicious. Poached perfectly the salad was not soagy. I asked for my bacon to be crispy and it was and still flavorful.

The huevos migas was okay. The chips were not the best I'm not sure if they were bought or made in store. 

If you don't mind the wait you should definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. Been coming here for close to 5 years now. Best brunch in the city, but I just can't do the lines anymore unless it's summer. Wish they would just take numbers. 
Food is consistent. Fave is the pulled pork (yucatan?) benny and the Bacon Brie Avocado benny. Huevos migas is also good. The 'poutine' is not, it was chunks of potatoes not fries and the ratio of everything in it was off. 
Good and friendly service too."}
{"text":"I arrived at lady marmalade at quarter to 1, found street parking right in front so I was already in a great mood. But i just couldn't believe there was a line out the door at 12:45 on a Tuesday! 

It's a good thing the weather was pleasantly warm because I had my baby with me. I wouldn't have waited outside in line had it been colder. 

Anyways, we were sat at around 1:00 so didn't wait too long. There isn't too much seating btw. We both ordered the huevos rancheros, except I got mine with pico de gallo instead of salsa, a maple butter tart and a cappuccino. 

Everything was AMAZING, except my cappuccino was warm, as if it was made and sat there too long or the milk they used was cold. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. 

The eggs are perfectly scrambled & fluffy, the guacamole was great, the tortilla was thin, soft, a great accompaniment. I could've done without the black beans to be honest as they were just there, I don't even think there was salt in them, but overall, the dish was amazing. 

I told my husband that we have to come back, it was just so delicious, I can't wait to explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I don't get it.

I'm not sure why this place receives such great reviews. The food was fine and the service was nice, but neither was extraordinary.

I would expect a 5/5 place to not have these issues:

- no reservations
- cash only
- they won't split the bill
- long wait (50 min)
- pour your own water

Overall it was still good, but nothing special, and I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go again."}
{"text":"Food was good, but not exceptionally so. I don't understand the hype with this place. Standard breakfast and lunch fare, reasonable prices, reasonable quality/quantity. Solid go to spot, but not worth the 30 min wait (even during the week)."}
{"text":"The good news is that the food is excellent, and far superior to its neighbour the Joy Bistro. The bad news is that Lady Marmalade will only become a 4 star restaurant when it realizes that they're popular enough to require a busboy or faster waitstaff. The menu tells customers to be patient, and I get that for food that's made fresh, but when you've been waiting in line for 30 minutes, and you see slow and disorganized waiters who don't know how to clear empty tables quickly, it can be mind boggling."}
{"text":"Everyone talks about the lineup, this is true. I don't like how it's cash only, this isn't some Chinese restaurant.

Otherwise, the food is decent. I did feel I come out of there spending more than what I'd like for breakfast though, $35 between 2 people.

I had the eggs benny with brie, avocado and bacon. I'm really not that big a fan of cheese, but I did not taste the brie. Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad. Avocado, I saw it, but wasn't doing too much on it's own. The bacon I could taste, like. The scallions that garnish it are a good flavor contrast, but the potatoes, felt they were a bit chewy rather than crunchy. Must have been sitting for a bit.

The coffee, good strong coffee makes for a good morning jolt. 

The servers came around frequently enough at the beginning to keep asking for refills of coffee, but I found it odd sometimes they ask half the table, move to another table and then MIGHT come back if there is more coffee I guess? I don't know if it's like a more efficient path to refilling coffee, just seemed odd."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for a delicious Breakfast Benny.
I went with a large party and by the time I was done taking in the scene and cute decor, we were being seated! wooo!

Everything on the menu looked delicious to me and the waiter was very understanding and helpful with narrowing down all the scrumptious options.

I ordered the eggs benedict which tasted even better than their flawless presentation. The hollandaise sauce didn't feel too heavy or creamy like most places so that \"too full\" feeling was nonexistent after finishing my plate!

My sister had the crepe croque monsieur (they also sub the ham for veggies!) and again, the presentation was good but the flavors were even better!

The rest of the group ordered several other things off the menu and I can honestly say that no one was disappointed.

You can really see and taste the care they put into their food, from finding the freshest ingredients to providing such seasonal flavors that you're left craving more long after your meal is over. I will definitely be back here to brunch the next time I visit!
y be back here to brunch the next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Never mind that we waited an hour for a table on a sunny Sunday, and never mind that they only take cash. The food is totally worth it.

I was with a group of four and we all enjoyed our food. Eggs benny was perfect. Tofu scramble with brown rice was wonderful. Coffee was amazing. Fresh squeezed orange juice was soo good. Service was great, the waitresses were all super sweet and friendly.

My new favourite breakfast place."}
{"text":"There's a lot of character in this diner. The yellow and whimsical ambiance, with mismatched kitschy vintage furnishings, gives Lady Marmalade a hipster-vibe-meets-your-grandma's-kitchen feeling, to put it that way. The friendly young staff also reflect this vibe. Totally diggin' it.

They have a simple menu of their own spin on classic diner fares. I had a poutine (which apparently they don't make on weekends), and it was a thick large blob of hash browns and miso gravy, not a lot of cheese curds. Filling, yes.

They don't open for dinner though. And did I mention the constant daily lineups?

{TTC: any Queen streetcar to Logan Ave.}"}
{"text":"I dropped by here one Friday morning, literally 5 minutes after they opened.  

I was delighted to see that there were already 4-5 tables occupied.  Another 4 tables would fill up by the time I was finished eating here 30 minutes later.  A good sign I suppose, if there is a regular following at this early in the day.

I've been to a few breakfast/brunch restaurants in Montreal recently. One place of particular note was L'Avenue.  Their eggs benedict is absolutely to die for. 

Would I find the same at Lady Marmalade? I was hoping but alas, I was disappointed. It did not even come close.

While service was fantastic, and friendly as well as welcoming - unfortunately, the food did not live up to my standards.

I ordered the eggs benedict with pulled pork, with a side of orange juice. Juice was freshly squeezed and was very refreshing.  But that's where the good stuff ended.

My eggs benny tasted dull, the Hollandaise sauce tasted plain and under seasoned.  While the eggs were cooked just right, the sauce did nothing to bring out the overall flavor.  The accompanying potatoes were dry, and was too under seasoned.   It was like they were almost a day old, left overs from the previous day that were just reheated in an oven.  Potatoes should not taste this dry, unless they're French Fries.   The pulled pork was also dry, with hardly any flavor.  

I had to add salt to my plate to try and bring out any semblance of taste.

Service while was memorable, the food alas was not.  

I am not sure if I would visit again to give Lady Marmalade another chance.  

If you are ever in Montreal, may I recommend visiting L'Avenue.  While far in distance from Lady Marmalade, L'Avenue is light years ahead when it comes to breakfast and brunch.  

If this place is the best Toronto has to offer for brunch, then oh my, we are severely lacking in culinary tastes!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that most of the furnishings at Lady Marmalade were bought up in garage sales all over Leslieville.  Sitting in there having brunch one can't help but to notice that you feel like you are at your Great Auntie Myrtle's kitchen table.  I half expected my breakfast to be served on melamine plates.  LM has a kitsch that is almost cartoonish but it works and it puts you into a comfort zone that is fun and laidback.  It's clanging, banging and noisy but you don't notice and you don't care.  

The lines ups to LM always seem to ooze right out on to Queen St. and it appears along that strip of Leslieville they are the only resto for blocks in either direction that this is happening at.  We waited about 20 minutes for a table and when we left there was an even longer lineup waiting for a chance to get in the door.  Lady Marmalade is a bona fide brekkie joint that has quickly found its niche among the pop spots of Joy, Lil Baci, Barrio and Sophie's, none of which I might add had a line up of any sort even though they were all open for brunch. 

I met up with my fella Yelptress, Shari \"shut the barn door!\" M. and my daughter Meg \"My Mother has exquisite taste\" M. for some Saturday brunch.  I opted for the eggs/bacon/home fries; Shari went right for the Huevos Migas and Miss Meg was jones'ing for some Eggs Benny.  Regular coffee with your breakfast is a bottomless cup (I love bottomless cups of the java on a Saturday morning!).  Meg delighted in some tangy, tart, refreshing, lip smacking homemade lemonade and Shari slurped up and savoured a tall glass of some sort of Latte Machiato.

My eggs were quite good, soft and buttery tasting.  I hate when restaurants turn scrambled eggs in something rubbery and lumpy.  I ordered brown toast and got three slices of that thin chewy rye bread which I love and I'm pretty sure it was Dimplifmier (sp?).  Shari was savoring her Migas, at least it sure sounded like that with the big mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm's rolling around.  

My only complaint about my breakfast is that the homefries suck.  How's that for constructive criticism?  The chunks of potatoes are way too large, not cooked enough and the seasoning makes them taste dry.  I prefer my homefries in smaller pieces and just a tad crispier and of course since they are spuds, being cooked all the way through is a must.  

All in all, I like Lady Marmalade.  They rock the tunes, the joint is just humming, there is great art of the wall, the salt & pepper shakers at our table were a pair of little cowboy boots, the menu is quite large so there is something for every one (damn you vegetarians....yes there is some sort of effing tofu scrambled concoction on the menu).   Next time I'm going for the french toast because it looked awesome!  As usual, I've pasted up my pics."}
{"text":"Did I go to the same restaurant as everyone else? My boyfriend and I had heard great things: best eggs benny in Toronto, worth the wait, etc. so we decided to check it out for brunch. Waited about 30 minutes in line (from what I've heard on a nicer Sunday you would wait about an hour) for a table by the door (cold! But a full house in a diner-style place, so forgivable). 

Ordered drip coffee and the famous brie avocado eggs benedict. Drip coffee was pretty bad (burnt). Eggs in the eggs benedict were overcooked and near solid yolks for both myself and my boyfriend's meal. The side salad was, equally unfortunately, made with old lettuce and spinach leaves. 

Staff were nice and you could tell they were scrambling because of the crowds. Waited a bit long for coffee refills but not as big of a deal as the disappointing food.

I'm just confused because we had heard such amazing things about this place and the line is always out the door! Maybe just hype?"}
{"text":"We had 3 different eggs benny and all the eggs were poached perfectly and the coffee was excellent. Wish they were still in Victoria BC."}
{"text":"All I have to say is if your wanting any type of eggs benedict.  This is the place to go.  It's not just the eggs benny and potatoes, they also give u a side salad which I really liked.  Their portions are large, very fairly priced and you feel like your in the 70's-80's with their old chairs and tables.  I would avoid the weekend because the waits are ridiculous.  I went on a Monday and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"If you show up and wait in line they will not serve you unless all of your guests are with you. I mean 4 out of 4. Not 3 out of 4 or 1 out of 2. Apparently this is the policy. It's not worth the wait. There are better places nearby..."}
{"text":"We were here on Saturday morning (10:30-ish) there was about a 20 minute wait.  (I think there's almost always a line, but for good reason, it was rather tasty).

We went with the mango eggs benny and the migas (which was huge!  Order if famished!"}
{"text":"I've been here almost 10 times now (didn't check in every time woops!) 

It has never disappointed me. I've tried most of the brunch menu. What I look for when I have any type of eggs benny is the poached egg and how well it is made. If I can put my knife in it and the egg yolk drools out, ITS GOOD! I've been to some brunch restaurants and they've never been as consistent and as good tasting as Lady Marmalade. This is one of my favorite places.

One of my favourite dishes is the Egg Benny with Brie and Avocado. Absolutely delicious. Along with my favorite freshly squeezed fruit juice: Beet, Ginger and Apple! To die for!!!!

I recommend this to any one who wants a great brunch experience.

Tip: Don't forget to come early because there is ALWAYS a line up. My first time, there was a line up of 2 hours! Nowadays, it's regularly around 20-30 minute wait time. But if you come with a buddy or two, it is a great time to catch up and huddle. :)"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch with some friends. It was a cold, snowy morning and we thought *maybe* there wouldn't be a line up...wrong. There was still a line up. We joined the line expecting someone to take down names and party sizes, perhaps, but was told that they didn't do that. In total, we waited about 45 minutes. Turnover seemed to be pretty quick - there was a constant trickle of people leaving. Note that they only seat full parties.

I had the eggs benny with the pulled pork. It was served with fried potatoes and a side salad. Portion size was quite reasonable for the price, and I was happily satisfied at the end of my meal. The salad and potatoes were slightly above average. The hollandaise sauce was made well and had a great flavour. The English muffins were toasted and buttered. They were slightly soggy due to the Hollandaise sauce. The pulled pork was good, not very saucy but had a bit of a kick. One of my eggs was slightly over cooked (yolk not runny) but the other was perfect. Despite these shortcomings, the overall meal was decent. The server brought out some house made hot sauce, which I really liked. If I go back, I will be sure to purchase a bottle. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience. I would go back again if I was craving brunch. Don't forget to bring cash, they don't take cards and don't have an ATM."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!

The best brunch I have ever had... and it's so consistent. Creative and fantastic for the egg eating vegetarians of the world as well!

Been there probably 20 times this year and it succeeds every time even when you are ordering poached eggs they are always perfect...

My wife and I are split...

My favourites are the the BLT with Avocado instead of bacon or the Croque Monsieur crepe with roasted veggies instead of ham...

My wife was all about the huevos rancheritos until she discovered the roasted veggie eggs benedict.

Get there during the week if you can!"}
{"text":"First morning in TO, our friend takes us here for brunch. 1 word for this place: nomnomnomnom. Perfect eggs and the bread!!!! Wow! My partner is particular about his eggs Benedict and, apparently, these were perfect. Friendly service too. Downside, only cash accepted and they had run out of apple crisp though it was still early, Next time I will have some."}
{"text":"I finally visited the infamous, cash-only, no reservation neighbourhood brunch diner. And I didn't stand in line - suck it yelpers!

I ordered the brie-aguacate-bacon eggs benedict dish. I loved the texture and taste of these ingredients against the toasted muffin. Obtaining fresh, ripe aguacate is key and they successfully did.

The dish also came with potatoes and a green salad. I would have much rather preferred fresh fruit instead of the salad.

My friend ordered the huevos rancheritos and she said it was good. I only saw a mess of frijoles and I would never order it.

Their coffee is quite fresh and ok.

by the way, we arrived at 9:30am and were seated immediately."}

my FAVORITE egg benny in toronto ! 

i LOVE brunch . brunch is my favorite meal and i swear i can have it for all 3 meals in a day . my bf on the other hand, hates brunch . he says its too girly & he gets nauseas from looking at egg yolk from egg bennies :( so whenever we go to a brunch place, i have the breakfast end of the brunch and he does the lunch end of the brunch . the only place he actually liked so far was the hoof cafe (THEE best !). since hoofs closed down shortly after my discovery of it :((, ive been looking for a brunch place we both love .

long story short, i absolutely adore lady marmalade . i love the decor, i love the staffs, i love the food . for the bf, he just said meh .

we got there around 2 on a bright sunny saturday afternoon and had to wait about 15 minutes . there is a chalkboard behind the waiting seat where you can scribble some drawings while you wait . very cute :) 

i ordered the raspberry apple juice (YUM) & cheddar, bacon, mango egg benny . the juice was SO fresh and i couldve drank 10 of them . my egg benny was amazinggg . sweetness of mango & the saltiness of bacon & the rich flavor of the cheese ... mmm need i say more ? OH and how do they get their english muffin stay so crispy without getting soggy from hollandaise ?! this egg benny is seriously magical .
my bf ordered a sandwich .. i was too busy reading the menu thoroughly over and over again that i dont even remember what he ordered . i actually didnt even try a bite of it cuz i was too busy w my egg benny . that NEVER happens ! never !! he said it was just okay . he really liked the salad dressing & the potatoes that came w my benny tho, whereas i didnt really care for them .

half star off because compared to hoofs (my brunch benchmark !), the food was awesome but at hoofs, everything on your plate compliments each other soooo well . its ... perfect . at lady marmalade, food is awesomely amazing but its not quite there yet . and because my bf's sandwich was just meh . but then again, who eats a boring sandwich at a brunch place ? :)"}
{"text":"Where the Yelp have I been?!  Well I'm happy to be back Yelping with an absolute delight of a diner.

I wouldn't usually find myself out in Leslieville on a Monday morning if it hadn't been for the need to return a lens to Headshots by 12, but after that was done I decided to meander down to Queen in hopes of finding Dark Horse, but instead came across quite the gem.

I can't say what caught my attention first, but one look at the posted menu and a peek inside was definitely all I needed.  I was immediately greeted by a baby (there were many of them here) and then a server who sat me down at a laminate wood table with mix-matched chairs and I was sold.

With little time and cash (they only take cash) on me, I decided to keep it simple and have a seasonal appropriate chai latte and the bread and bowl of soup combo.  The bread is advertised as organic \"St. John's\" and came warm and buttered.  The soup of the day was split pea and ham which was DELICIOUS.  It was obviously home made, as it came with an assortment of vegetables, small chunks of potato and pieces of ham!!  The bowl and plate was decorated with scallions, with a dash of paprika for colour.

The staff were kind and helpful, and I liked seeing the mixed crowd: babies and their mothers, hip couples, older couples, TTC employees.... And me!  It's a pleasure to see a colourful and fresh restaurant such as Lady Marmalade draw in such an assortment of locals.

The restaurant itself reminds you of being in a sixties home, with green walls and purple wood flooring (which I adored.)  Paintings for sale are currently up on the walls, and there's a designated chalk wall for the youngins, complete with chalk bucket.  The odd assortment of chairs and tables, salt and pepper shakers and coffee cups add to the kitschy and nostalgic atmosphere.  The sunburst clock on the back wall and hanging lights complete the look, which is even carried down into the basement, with framed pictures and patterned wallpaper in the washrooms.

I'd rank this place 5 stars, but before I get ahead of myself I'm going to have to go for another visit and have a bigger meal.  However, I did take the opportunity to snap some pictures on my cellphone, so be sure to check them out!"}
{"text":"The vibe: A pretty large, diner style (decor!) busy brunch spot. 

The food: I had a religious experience this weekend. After reading review after review of the perfection of this brunch spot, I finally made it there. And I haven't stopped thinking about it since. The food was PERFECT. I ordered the decadent avocado, bacon and brie eggs benedict, and it has made its way up to my favourite breakfast dish in the city (up there with Easy Rider's huevos divorcados!). The hollandaise was excellent, the bacon cooked to perfection, and the brie melted in all its glory. I can't wait to go back.

My go to meal: Avocado, brie and bacon eggs benny

Secret: Cash only! 

**FREE RANGE EGGS & LOCAL MEATS**"}
{"text":"Long long line.  I don't mind waiting but not on an actual line.  BUT being as I was with a group and going with the flow, I waited.  Good thing I did.   The huevos Rancheros which I order 90% of the time if it is on the menu was top 3 all time.  Great eggs scrambled with cheese, whole wheat tortilla nicely grilled, huge amount of black beans and fantastic chunky guac.  
Everyone else's brunches were excellent as well.  The know how to poach their eggs!
OH and the freshly squeezed mandarin and strawberry juice was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I can't just review this place for just one visit because I've been here too many times. And each time it was AMAZING. There's a reason why Lady Marmalade has a line up every weekend morning. 

The wait tends to be roughly 20 minutes .. and it's cash only. Otherwise, it's THE place for brunch. Really the only one if I had to choose between all the places in Toronto, which has  A LOT.

The meals are incredibly filling. It seems slightly pricey at first, but it's all worth it. THEY. ARE. BEAUTIFUL.

Even the servers are just lovely. 
Especially for a hangover meal (or just a getting-fat meal) this is the place to go.

I would definitely go back again.. and again.. and again. And again."}
{"text":"Great food, good with kids, but too small!   The Huevos Migas is to die for, and portion sizes are great!   Very good."}
{"text":"I cannot stress how amazing this restaurant is. I am so thankful for it's location since it's literally minutes away from my doorsteps. 

First off, I would like to warn everybody that if you go during their peak hours (usually weekends after 11AM), be expected to wait a good half hour or more. If you do have time, go on a weekday in the morning to avoid the line-ups or just go super early.

Their food is absolutely delicious. If you are a huge egg benedicts fan, this is the place to go. If you haven't been here yet, you are missing out! I've tried almost all of the different versions of egg benedicts that they offer and my absolute favourite would be the \"brie, avocade & bacon\" egg benedict. Smooth and crunchy and the flavours just work so well together it's like magic. 

They also serve dishes other than egg benedicts but go visit their website for the full menu and prices!

The interior of the restaurant is cute as well. It's vintage and has an old-school vibe with the mismatch of wallpaper, tables and chairs. It's first come first serve, so if you're going with a party of two and they give you a table that can seat 5-6 people, take it or leave it. You can always dismiss it and wait for a smaller table but if you're hungry, you just gotta do what you gotta do to eat great food! Don't worry, you won't be look downed upon when you and your friend takes up the entire table, haha. Think positive and brush it off because you've been waiting in line forever for this table, so screw the others! (But if a smaller table opens up, don't hesitate to ask them if you can move)

Overall, this place is small, cute and has a old school vintage feel and look to it. The food's great  and trust me, you'll be leaving the restaurant with satisfaction. Get past the long line ups and you'll be in for a pleasant treat!"}
{"text":"Wow - this place blew me away with their breakfast offering.   I had the Morrocan Scramble and it was fantastic.  Everything was perfect - charming decor, great service and fabulous food.  There was nothing I could find fault with.

Note:  If you go to use the bathrooms in the basement, and on the way up, you see the little sign that says watch your step... watch your step.  I tripped, despite the sign.  LOL

Note:  There is a lineup for breakfast - get there by about 8:30 to get ahead of the other diners.

Would I return:  You betcha.
Would I recommend.  A hearty yes."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place?
Cant really say it has a nice decor, or a good seating plan (Many times tables of 4 only have 2 people).

Food was alright. Nothing amazing or nothing bad. I wouldn't travel all the way to the east end for this place though.

Found it a little sneaky of the waitress to ask \"Soup or Salad?\" as if it were included with the dish that was ordered and to find it was charged on the bill. 

If you want to enjoy your brunch and be able to sit and talk Id find another establishment as they are pretty pushy here to get you out, so that they can start seating new people."}
{"text":"I came to Lady Marmalade after a quick Yelp search for brunch places and decided this is the place to try.  They had a whole section devoted to eggs benedict, so I thought it was right up my alley.  Who doesn't like brunch?

I got there on a saturday at about 10:15am and there was a tiny lineup out the door.  I waited probably for 15-20 minutes before I got a table (the place is pretty small).  The wait is ok, cause you start randomly looking at things that make Lady Marmalade what it is.  Art on walls (for sale), all the different salt shakers on the tables, the coffee cups that you remember from the 80s, the random plastic animals near the kitchen... you know, normal stuff.

After sitting down, we ordered the fruit crepe and the eggs benny with black forest ham.  The fruit crepe was crazy sweet, so much that my sugar-fiend of a fianc√© said it was too sweet.  I agree, but I don't really like sweets that much.

The eggs benny was pretty good.  The hollandaise was exactly what they said it was, \"lemony\".  They also served it with a mixed salad with a sesame ginger vinaigrette so it kinda paired well with the hollandaise.  The egg was cooked to a poached medium.  Personally for an eggs benedict I like it a little softer so that the yolk kinda mixes with the hollandaise to form a sauce.  The black forest ham was actually a pleasant change on your classic peameal bacon variety.  They shaved the black forest ham on so it was really soft and light.  It really matched the consistency to the rest of the eggs benedict.

The line up for this place just got worse and worse as we sat there, so if you do want to come for brunch I would come a bit earlier.  I didn't stay long enough for it to happen, but I'm guessing when the church across the street gets out, Lady Marmalade probably gets stuffed with church-ies."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on Thursday March 17th. Our server was friendly and the food came in a timely manner. A girl working in red plaid brought us the bread pudding we had ordered, called it french toast as she set it down, which made us think it wasn't what we ordered. Her response to us was quite rude. We had such a nice time up until that point - wasn't expecting the attitude! Would have been totally cool if she had 1. either called it bread pudding as was written on the chalkboard we had ordered from, or 2. corrected us by saying \"yes french toast, bread pudding, it's the same thing. I know it's confusing!\" 
I'm not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"Very tasty brunch place. Beware of long line ups! Come early if you can to get a seat."}
{"text":"I dream about this place. Everything I have ever tried here has been delicious. From the eggs benny to the huervos rancheros to the sandwiches. The only downside is the place is small, so there is usually quite a line up outside. Otherwise, if you're willing to wait at prime time hours, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Holy baloney this was the best brunch EVER. Yes the line up can get long if you get there too late, but it is so completely worth it. Staff are great, atmosphere is friendly, and the food choices are abundant and healthy!

The best part is, no matter how you ask for your eggs to be cooked, they come out perfectly ever time. poached eggs here are the best!!!

And I love the different juices they make! I got one that I think was... apple beet and ginger? It was sooo good!!!! 

I wish I lived closer so I could go more often but it's a great treat once in a while. =)"}
{"text":"It's hard to truly add anymore about this place that hasn't been written or taken a photo of.

Useful info before you go: you will wait in line (the bigger your party, say 6 people, a longer wait);  cash only; no outside drinks - but it's worth it.

Be prepared to be taken back to the 70's.   

Food once ordered comes to the table fairly fast. 
Food tastes fresh and portions are filling.
If you are a gluten free worrier, add this place to your list. It definitely accommodates your needs.

The only down side is the music is so loud. Hard to hear people in your party speak!

Other than that enjoy!"}
{"text":"Come Early! My friend and I arrived at around 9am on a Saturday and there was already a line out the door. We waited around 25 minutes before we were seated. 

We didn't try anything sweet, nothing really caught my eye on the sweet side. We order 2 Eggs Benny - One was the Bacon, Cheddar and Mango Salsa Benny, the other was the Pulled Pork Benny. Eggs Benny dishes come with salad and home fries (big fan of the salad dressing). 

WOW.... Both were absolutely delicious. The combination of the Mango Salsa and Bacon was amazing. I would have a really hard time deciding between the two, as the pulled pork one was also amazing. The eggs were cooked to perfection and the most important thing was the feeling after, I was satisfied without feeling gross. 

I would definitely come back here, but it would be a lot earlier. 

Keep Eating, 
Angela"}
{"text":"Really loud noisy place. The lunch menu is NOT good and the servers don't care whether or not you like your food. I ordered the chicken sandwich, ate one bite, told the manager it was not good, the chicken tasted bad and the mayo was too much and gross. She didn't do anything and did not care less. I ALWAYS tip no matter how bad the service was but in this case I did not as I paid $20 for a meal I ate one bite of. Waste of money."}
{"text":"I arrived here for brunch around 12, and was seated about half an hour later at 1 pm. There always seems to be a line for this place.

The food came at a reasonable speed. My scramble was just OK - I didn't really like its flavors, and it was too dry for my liking. The salad was also nothing memorable. My friend got the Thai crunch salad, which had good flavors but was a tad too oily. His salmon also tasted really unfresh - I thought it would have been the taste of freezer burn. We told our waitress, and she kindly removed the fish from our bill.

Overall, this place was just average. The atmosphere is nice, but the food is simply mediocre."}
{"text":"On a bitchy note: wow, the reviewer below called \"Wandering i\" sounds like a bit of an ass-hat.

Anyway. About Lady Marmalade...yes, you'll probably have to wait in line if you get here on a weekend during peak hours. How long you're willing to wait for brunch is really up to you (Bonjour Brioche, the other brunch hot-spot in this neighbourhood, is a 5-min walk west if you want to compare wait-times; or you can try the other umpteen brunch options on this stretch of Queen)...we waited about 15 minutes for a table at Lady Marmalade and I'd say the brunch was worth it. 

Eggs bennies were beautifully cooked and super delicious. I ordered mine with bacon but they also make it with black forest ham, pulled pork (!) or spinach, and they even offer additional enhancements like avocado, brie or cheddar. The avocado/bacon/brie benny is apparently quite popular. For a bennie purist like myself (I just want my poached egg, hollandaise and meat on an English muffin) I really enjoyed the Lady Marmalade version, and I'm picky. But, I'd probably sooner return to Fanny Chadwick's at Dupont/Bathurst, only because it's closer to my house and their bennies beat Marmalade by just a smidge (Fanny's homemade English muffins are delish). But Marmalade was still worth a visit to the beaches. Quick service and nice staff...plus, the bennie's accompanying potatoes were tasty; Americano was good; and beet/apple/ginger juice (the fresh juice of the day, written on the chalkboard) was a nice healthy treat. I can see why this has become a brunch fave in the east end--it's got quality food and bevs in a hip lil space.

The only thing I didn't love was the lineup of people standing there waiting for tables to open up. It's not the restaurant's fault, but if I were seated at one of the tables in the middle of the room, I would definitely find the gawkers intrusive. Like, stop watching me eat!

Anyway. That aside, did Lady Marmalade live up to the lineup-laden hype? Yes! Yes it did."}
{"text":"We decided to visit this place because a certain restaurant that also served an amazing breakfast/brunch and had great reviews had a 2hr wait. I figured Lady Marmalade would be an excellent plan b. Boy was I wrong. You would think with the long line outside and great Yelp reviews that this place would be amazing. The line went by pretty fast. They have a good system for handling the line. You can definitely get inside in under 30 minutes if you have a small party, say a party of 2. 

Very, very limited breakfast menu. If you're not crazy about eggs Benedict (AKA Bennies) or Mexican inspired breakfast dishes, then you're screwed. I ordered the 2 eggs platter. I asked for scrambled eggs with cheese. The eggs were scrambled, just minus the cheese. However, they did give me plenty of bacon and the jam for my toast was great. Now let's talk about their bread pudding (AKA, \"Our version of French toast\").  People, bread pudding is bread pudding. It does NOT function as a substitute for French toast just because you pour syrup on top. I love all people but clearly some white guy with a Daniel Norris beard and rides a bike baked the bread pudding. Simple bread pudding is bread, eggs, butter, sugar, sweetened condensed milk, and then bake it. This literally was bread soak in some type of hipster milk-substitute based product. They ran out of the raspberry lemon, so I had to settle for the strawberry chocolate. THANK GOD FOR SYRUP. It was beyond bland. I almost sent it back, but I was starving and I was tired of waiting. One of the worst breakfast experiences I've had in recent memory. If you're a fan of bland food and don't know any better, you'll love this place. But if you have taste buds, you love flavor, and you know that a pinch of salt and pepper is not real seasoning, you're going to despise this place."}
{"text":"Lady marmalade offers up some of the best brunch fare in Toronto. I visited for the first time with my partner last weekend. LM are known for their bennies, so I ordered a cheddar, bacon & mango salsa eggs benedict. It was delicious, and the mango was an interesting compliment to my favorite brunch meal. I also ordered a coffee (reasonable), and a peant-butter ice cream shake (yum!). 

Our main waitress was very nice, and generally attentive given the weekend crowd. Unfortunately the other waitress who was floating around, at times with the coffee pot and other times not, had a perpetual disapproving look and sighed contemptuously as she assessed the room. She also skipped my table on the coffee refills.

There are two main negatives for LM. Firstly, they really need to remodel their entrance way so there is a second door/coat area. Naturally, no one wants to stand outside in -30c windchill temps, so everyone is trying to cram into the place. That means the single front door is continually being held open, leading to cold gusts of air. But, it's Canada, so you kind of expect this in winter. The wait was fairly long, about 30 minutes, and we arrived just before the crush. 

The food was great, and the value was fair. To be honest though, it's no better than Bonjour Brioche, and it definitely wasn't worth the extra 15-20 minutes of waiting."}
{"text":"If I lived in Leslieville, I'm sure this would be a brunch staple, but, as I do not, it's a special treat.

The one and only time (unfortunately) I have made it here, I had the spinach and aged cheddar waffles, which were SO good. Kind of like a gourmet grilled cheese. As a non-egg eater, I appreciate brunch variety. 

I only wish they served the breakfast poutine on weekends, as this is something I definitely want to try someday soon!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place until a friend of mine recommended we go for brunch today. It was a pretty good sign that people were huddled outside the door waiting for a table and looking inside you could see staff were doing their best to move people in/out as efficiently as possible. Yes, there is a bit of a wait but the food is delicious.

Their menu is fairly extensive with gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan options. Our waiter was very familiar with the menu and knew exactly what was in each dish. They are very accommodating to special diets and allergies although they can't guarantee that if you allergic to something that there won't be traces of it in your food.

I had the Huevos Migas and as others have stated, the portion is fairly sizable and delicious. It appears to be one of the popular items on the menu along with any of their benny's. The price point was reasonable for the amount of food received and once seated we did not feel rushed at all.

Would definitely consider returning in the future."}
{"text":"Lady Marmalade is a fabulous small  breakfast joint Lesliville. Even on Friday it had a bit of a wait, but the smell wafting from the kitchen kept us in line. I purchased the Tofu scramble and my friend purchased one if their egg dishes. Both dishes were well portioned and came with just the right amount of food. The tofu and spinach paired well together for the scramble and the potatoes and salad with light dressing really hit the spot. I also loved the Hearty bread that came with the meal as it had a nutty oat flavor. Good service and reasonable prices make this place a good joint for any breakfast lover."}
{"text":"*4.5 STARS

I trekked all the way downtown today with my friend (like ULTRA early; so early to the point that I forgot that the subway did not open until 9 and that my friend had to pick me up and drive me down).  Last time I passed by here, it was 1 PM, and the line ups were ridiculous.  So I decided to come by here when it first opened.

I started with the honey ginger tea because I wasn't feeling the greatest -- it was quite smoothing and felt ultra nice (totally suggest this if you think you're coming down with the cold).  My friend had the huevos migas, and I had myself the avocado, brie, and bacon benny.  Three things that I love combined into one.

The verdict?  It was okay.  I wouldn't rave about it (granted, I wasn't that hungry when I woke up today).  It was an interesting mixture of flavours, but it was a bit heavy on the hollandaise sauce that it covered up the tastes of the brie and avocado.  The english muffin was interesting -- toasted -- to the point it was crunchy.  I surprisingly didn't mind this because it complemented the soft avocado and brie very well.  It also came with a salad and a homefries.  Homefries had a little kick to it, and the salad had an Asian sesame dressing on it which was unexpected (but good!)

Overall, good food, however, I think my friends had overhyped it for me. :("}
{"text":"I have to say, I don't get the fuss. I've done brunch all over the city and this place was mostly blah, and just barely ok in the food department.  Maybe it was too hyped up, but I really didn't have a good experience.

I went with my girlfriend and we didn't wait too long for a table, and were seated by a nice woman who was pretty much the best front of house staff person we encountered. After that it was all downhill.

Our waitress took about 15 minutes to even stop by, serving others who were seated after us first. One waitress was speedy and helping out, our waitress spent lots of time at the back, chatting with staff at the window and in the dish area. 

When she noticed us finally, as we started to peer around for people to serve us, she begrudgingly came over and sort of huffed through our order.  I have to say, we were never rude, and in fact smiled and tried to be pleasant. It's a busy place and we like to give people the benefit of the doubt. But her slowness beat that out of us, as it was clear that she just didn't care.

The food came up quickly (the cooking staff looked hard working and efficient), and was well presented. That being said, the toast and homefries were dry, the benny was meh, my girlfriends bacon was VERY soft, and the \"salad' was lettuce doused in sesame sauce.

Maybe this is the best option in the neighbourhood, but this doesn't even compare to the likes of Grapefruit Moon, Tati, or even Auntie's and Uncles in the west end. I won't be going back, and will try some other places in Leslieville, but overall this place was more hype than substance in my opinion. 

This place could be great, but needs a bit of shock treatment to get it up to the high standard for brunch that I've come to expect from Toronto."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast/brunch/lunch menu. Everything I have had is delicious, it's like a mexican twist on traditional breakfast. The place is unique, friendly and prompt service, although you will most likely have to wait for a table during peak times but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"The huevos rancheros are decent and the coffee is not horrible, unlike most breakfast places. They're super accommodating to folks with gluten problems. Nearly everything can be made gluten-free. Not the cheapest, but it's worth it. 

Be forewarned: Be prepared to wait a WHILE if you come on a weekend. It's popular."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my bestie for my birthday :) loved it!!! we took people's recommendation on Yelp and tried their eggs benedict along with one of their mexican breakfasts. both were SUPER delicious! I've always been hesistant about how the mexican side would affect the breakfast but it actually went together perfectly. The place is super busy with line up out of the door on a Saturday lunch. Definitely one of the best brunch places I've been to - the food is amazing and if you're ever in the Leslieville area def check this place out!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and it has always been amazing. There is usually a line up, but things move quickly. We were standing outside for a few minutes until a table for two was cleared. Everyone ahead of us was a party of 4 or more. Anyhow, I had the Huevos Migas and it was unbelievable. So many delicious flavours and the portion was great! I love the beet ginger juice. 

This place may not be the best for kids or very large groups."}
{"text":"This place reminded me just why I love brunch - for the excitement of beginning your day with an absolutely delicious and fantastic meal, for starting your day off just right, and for discovering the myriad of ways you can throw twists to basic breakfast food and make it so much more interesting and delicious. I finally understand the hype about this place.

We visited this place at around 9:30 AM on a Saturday morning and it was packed. Luckily, because it was early, we were the first in line, and we were seated within 10 minutes. Service was quick, efficient, but still incredibly friendly and didn't push us too hard when we were indecisive about the menu.

We ordered, a) Cheddar and Spinach Waffles ($12.00), b) Fresh Fruit Crepe ($11.00), c) Beet Juice ($4.00). We absolutely and unequivocally recommend the Cheddar and Spinach Waffles - the flavours together were spectacular. The cheddar didn't make it too salty, and the bacon gave it a nice crunchy texture. It was just right. The fruit crepe was incredibly fresh and delicious (but something I could make at home). Overall, fresh ingredients, well-thought-out recipes, and a very delicious meal.

Very basic, casual atmosphere with a not-so-basic take on breakfast/brunch. We would definitely come back here again. For two people, with tax, tip, we paid around $39.00."}
{"text":"We were actually planning to go somewhere else for lunch when this place caught our eye.  There seemed to be a decent number of people in the restaurant, plus the plates of food they were plunking down right in front of the window looked tasty enough to change our plans.

A little slow getting to our table to take our order, but the food came out quite quickly once we ordered.  They were good at refilling coffee as well, which was nice.  I had the pulled pork on a crusty bun.  While messy, it was very tasty, minus the one big bite of cilantro I got (but I'm not a huge cilantro fan, so your mileage may vary).  My Mom had the club sandwich, which looked really good - bacon, chicken and nice slices of avocado.  We both had the borscht as our accompanying dish and that was really tasty, to the point where I was kind of sad when I got to the bottom of the bowl.

We went at an off-peak time (14:30 or so on a Friday afternoon) so waiting wasn't something we had to deal with.  It's not food that I'd be willing to sit in the rain waiting for a seat to open up for, but there aren't many places that I'd give that designation to anyways.  

Prices were good for the size of the meals - big sandwich and a pretty reasonable helping of soup each with two coffees for about $30.  Definitely had worse for less out there."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch last weekend. It's pretty similar to the popular brunch spots in New York in that it's relatively small, and it will get backed up if you show up late. We got here a touch before 10 AM, and we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table - mainly because the first wave of diners began finishing at the same time. The line was much longer by the time we finished up. Service here is okay, although they do refill your water all the time, which is a nice little touch.

The food here is absolutely delicious for brunch. I got the apple cinnamon French toast, which is different from your regular French toast. It's much denser and does indeed have the texture of bread pudding. Mixed with slices of banana and syrup, though, it's a fantastic dish. The side of sausage (which I later discovered was acquired from a meat shop down the block) was very fresh and flavorful as well. My girlfriend had the huevos rancheritos. Mexican-style brunch dishes can go either way for me, but the freshness of the pico de gallo on the scrambled eggs, combined with homemade guacamole, was so good. It's not as heavy a dish, but it still works out really well. The strawberry/tangerine juice was well worth the price. Most freshly squeezed juice isn't, but you get a decently sized glass, and the fruit combo here worked so well, especially with the extra citrus-y kick that the tangerine adds.

I'd love to come back here for their lunch dishes as well - they look great as well. There aren't a lot of spots, and the tables and seating aren't exactly the nicest, but you're coming here to eat a meal first and foremost. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The location is just right outside of downtown Toronto so it's pretty convenient. I think the most memorable thing I remember coming here was the terrific music of old school classic rock n roll. I kept hearing great song after great song while enjoying my meal with friends. The other noticeable thing I saw were the furniture setup as every table seems to be different and every chair had that eclectic feel to them. It's almost like the owner went to a junk yard or yard sale to pick up various pieces so that they are consistently different. So I thought that was a nice touch on the decor.

We came here for brunch and I ordered the Crepe Ham with Eggs. I thought the crepe ham was good but maybe a bit on the salty side and the spinach helped compliment the taste quite well. But the eggs were okay as the egg white part was kinda dry and tasted very rough for some reason. Also my side of potatoes cubes was very dull with no flavour, maybe i should have added some ketchup to it. However, the bread was definitely the winner here as the crust was crunchy but not over toasted and very good with a little bit of butter and jelly. 

Overall, a decent place to come for breakfast/brunch as parking on the street was pretty easy and service was overall fast and friendly. Although I wouldn't bring a chick here for some good eats as the crowd is of older people and energy was kinda low key. Plus it's about $20 a person so it ain't super cheap, so I wouldn't risk wasting my money on a chick during first few dates unless she is willing to foot the bill, then you should bring her here no problems."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for brunch but with a twist to it then this is the place...also offering gluten free & organic items...friendly service...in a quaint and retro decor dining room.

Can't go wrong with any of the waffle dishes and eggs benedict dishes...it is a little pricey for brunch food and the lineups can be up to 30mins but well worth the wait.

Note, bring cash! No debit/credit!

Would I go again? Yes definitely!"}
{"text":"I hate waiting in line for restaurants, but as much as I hate to admit it, Lady M is worth the wait. The cheddar spinach waffles are to die for! So flavourful and melty. I had them with avocado and poached eggs and it was a filling meal. The side salad was generous and the dressing was great. My friends also loved their meals - the Mexican meatball soup and the crepe croque Monsieur. Try to go on a weekday if you can. There will likely still be a wait, but it'll be closer to 20 mins than an hour. My only complaint is that it's uncomfortably loud in here, but there's probably not much they can do about that. The food is excellent, so go for your mouth not your ears!"}
{"text":"A very hipster spot in the east end. Best Eggs Benedict I've ever had. Had to wait about 35mins to get a table but it was well worth the wait. 

I had the Brie, Avocado and Bacon signature bennies. Everything was cooked to perfection and the staff were very efficient and friendly. I would definitely come back! ..even if I have to wait again."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for brunch. 

I will say that the food is very good, excellent for vegetarians since there are a lot of options that don't include meat and eggs are usually optional for those who do not eat them. 

But... I'm just not into waiting for 1 or more hours to get into a place like this. If you get lucky and you're walking by and there's no line... go for it! But I wouldn't be making any special trips out to Lesliville to go here. Have a backup because you will likely get Hangry while waiting. The food is not worth the wait..."}
{"text":"If you don't like cilantro, you might have a hard time at Lady Marmalade. 

There was a period in my life where cream was king and cilantro was queen, so of course LM was my favourite Leslieville brunch spot. The mismatched chairs and grunge feel match their Victoria, BC location and the clientele definitely blend together with their plaid and wayfarers. 

Crowd aside, the food is SPECTACULR. Every bennie or heuevos dish has that certain homey taste to it (must be the Rowe Farm placebo effect) and I can't get enough of their Thai slaw. Once I even skipped work and went there for a weekday lunch just for that slaw. It's unbelievably difficult to replicate. 

Anyone who hates Lady Marmalade must have been writing a review post-2 hour brunch wait, or just does not like great food. Recognize it for what it is, it's the Jekyll to Bonjour Brioche's Hyde, the Sonny to Ed Levesque Kitchen's Cher. It's the yummiest part of waking up at 8am and the worst part of a hungover Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Lady Marmalade is not your usual breakfast place.  It is one of the best, if not the best place for breakfast/brunch.

First thing you'll notice is the very long line up.  Waited about 30 min before entering on a Saturday afternoon.  After the line up went indoors, I couldn't help noticing how small the restaurant was, wishing they could expand it to fit more customers.  Also noticed the artwork for sale on the walls, and the interesting organic theme which was also the theme on the menu.

Ordered the scrambled eggs with sausage dish, and was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful it was prepared.  Wishing I could come here every day if only I lived closer.  Everything was done just perfect, from the eggs, to the sausage, to the potatoes, to the salad.  These aren't the usual eggs and sausage you would find at other places, they are well seasoned with lots of flavour.

Definitely would recommend to anyone who enjoys good quality breakfast and can get here early enough!  (closes at 3pm on weekends)."}
{"text":"My favourite place for brunch, always worth queuing outside, even in winter. As someone who lives in Leslieville, we were sad to hear Lady Marmalade is moving away, this place has been such a neighbourhood icon!"}
{"text":"Lady Marmalade has been on my list of potential brunch locales after having visited Bonjour Brioche about a month earlier. Given the popularity of these places, my friend and I knew we should arrive early if we wanted to avoid any sort of lineup.

We came on a Sunday (Easter Sunday) morning and arrived at around 8:30 to find most seats still open. Shortly after being seated though and when we received our orders, the place was filled.

I ordered the huevos migas with a coffee - and my friend ordered the avocado, brie and bacon benny with a honey ginger tea. 

The meal was good - it was a sizable plate of food and perhaps it was due to my tiredness (waking up at 6am after a late night previously to get into Lady Marmalade before the lineup) but I did not end up finishing the entire thing. Chalk it up to my inexperience in eating this, but I found myself a little lost as to how to eat all the parts: soft-scrambled eggs with cheese/tomatoes/scallions/sausage, basmati brown rice, smashed beans, salsa, tortilla chips. 

Generally a good place, I would come back to try something else on the menu - perhaps one of their bennys."}
{"text":"I would've given this place 3 stars, except it's the 2 star rating that uses the word \"meh\" which is a pretty accurate description.

Came here with my SO and a couple of friends on a Saturday morning and had to wait approximately 30 mins for a table (totally acceptable for any decent brunch place).  Service was speedy (huzzah) but the food was just okay.  My SO and another brunch member both had the eggs benny, which wasn't anything especially spectacular - especially compared to the Beacher Cafe who make a much better hollandaise sauce.

I had their version of the Huevos Rancheros which was also just okay.  Came with salsa on the eggs, overly salty black beans (which I could barely touch), a bit of guacamole, and a tortilla.  I only ordered the Huevos Ranceros b/c I am vegetarian who cannot eat Hollandaise sauce or runny eggs.  Perhaps if those options were open to me I would have liked it better. 

Had this place not had the long wait, and was considerably cheaper (Hello, $70 for 4 people? what gives?) I might come back again and give it another go.  However, given those two factors combined with the \"meh\" level of food, I'll be hitting up one of the other many brunch spots in the area.

Oh, and cash only."}
{"text":"Best brunch in the city? Ongoing debate.

Best eggs benny in the city? Lady Marmalade.

Not a huge waffle, pancake or french toast kinda girl. Give me a good omelette or benny any day. So, this 30-min-wait-Leslieville-hot-spot already has that going for them. No, impartiality doesn't exist here.

7 featured bennies on the menu. Ranging from brie, avocado & bacon (which L got, minus the bacon) to fresh tomato & pesto, everything is made fresh and to order.

After much debate, decided on the cheddar, bacon & mango. Attempted a bacon-avocado swap, but no substitutions allowed. My 2 cents: avocado should just be a given. Or a staple, like ketchup.

Served on charmingly mismatched plates & cutlery, our bennies come smothered in a creamy lemony hollandaise, with a side of greens & potatoes. With that first bite... yes! Love a good benny. 1 down, 6 to go.

T ordered the \"kung foo\": organic tofu scramble with shitakes, bokchoy, spinach, scallions, sesame, served with basmati brown rice, toast & a salad. Unique for a brunch menu, yes. Enjoyed, yes.

Other stand-outs with rave reviews - the huevos rancheritos &/or huevos migas. Just another reason to come back ;)"}
{"text":"So surprised I haven't wrote a review for this place yet since it had significant meaning for me!

The lineup is the only thing holding this place back but I guess that's part of the charm - which makes you even more hungry for the food. The poached egg BLT and eggs benny are to die for. Make sure you ask for the hot sauce, it has a pleasant kick. 

Give this place a try on a day you aren't heavily scheduled for the morning!"}
{"text":"With so many friends telling me about this yummy brunch spot, I was so darn happy to finally get to go and try it out with my bf this past Monday! We were first shocked with the busy line up of how packed it was for a Monday as we arrived a little before noon. The downside of this brunch spot is that it dosen't take reservations as it's a pretty small spot so the line up can be killer, but lucky for us we were able to get seated after about a 10min wait; but I have to mention, the line did not die down and it only got longer after my bf and I left. Also note that this spot only takes cash and debit. 

My bf and I shared the huveos migas and the eggs benedict with brie, avocado and bacon. We paired our meal with my bf getting a cappuccino and myself getting a London fog latte. We were both pleased and ended the meal with happy tummies as we both agree that you truly get your money's worth for the portion of the meals - especially with the huveos migas."}
{"text":"Busy restaurant, but food quality is nothing to brag about.  Even MacDonald breakfast is much better in quality n price.

Coffee was sour.  I ordered two eggs n sausages.  Turn out like one egg meal.  No more than 10 pieces of potato wedges.

Service is very attentive."}
{"text":"What can I say that has not been said before? The bennies are always a great choice, but I have been having huevo migas more lately. 

Please please please try the mango lassi.

Just like any other brunch places, expect lineups."}
{"text":"An outstanding breakfast spot in Leslieville.

The combination of creative menu, styling patrons, killer music and tattooed waitresses gets me every single time.

Food was delicious.   Coffee was consistently refilled.   Everyone was smiling.   No one got hurt.  Felt at home.  

They only take cash.

I can't wait to hit up the ATM and then go back."}
{"text":"Bad experience.

I do love this place in some ways but their cash only, holier then thou attitude, poorly handled line ups and borderline lazy staff has turned me off of the place.

Most recently I went for a midweek lunch yesterday and the staff seemed genuinely disinterested in serving people quickly and seating new people as tables cleared.

We were late for our next stop by the time we were seated we asked just for a quick bowl of soup. The waitress would not get it out of the pot for us and insisted we'd have to wait for the 4 orders in front of us, all fully cooked meals. Why when we were in a rush she couldn't quickly pour two bowls of soup can only be described as not giving a crap about us. Zero effort unfortunately, hence zero stars. This is ruining an otherwise nice experience that used to be lady marmalade.

If you're going to have a restaurant pretend at least to care and show some effort if your customers are in a rush."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The gluten free eggs benny was one of the most delicious things I've had for brunch in a while. What was impressive was that the staff knew how to accommodate my gluten free needs right down to knowing which salad dressing had wheat in it. What exceeded my expectations was that the service was warm and swift. It's hard to find good service, especially brunch service these days. Some busy brunch spots would have their staff staring daggers at the diners, but this didn't happen at all. I was extremely impressed and am dreaming of when next I can return."}
{"text":"This place is known for its benny and being an eggs benny fan I had to try this place. And I am glad I did :) I ordered the roasted vegetables and aged cheddar signature benny and it was cooked really well. The place is really small and cozy with good service. Would definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place and finally got around to trying it with some friends.  The wait wasn't too bad considering there were 6 of us on a Saturday morning.  Arriving at 9:30 we waited about 5 or 10 minutes.  Let's call it 7.

Cute place.  Cute people in the place.  Food on the tables looks incredible.  I am thinking that this place may live up to the hype.

I was very wrong.  Menu reads well with savoury dishes and sweet dishes, alot of egg options.

I ordered the eggs benny with avocado, brie and bacon, others at the table ordered the french toast, some more eggs benny, huevos migas and the miso crepe dish (forget the name).

I found the hollandaise on the the benny relaly weird and offputting and their homes fries, while looking amazing, tasted terribly oily and they were pretty bad.  

The french toast turned out to be so thick and doughy it was almost like bread pudding.  So if you like bread pudding,, well then .......

The migas, was actually pretty good but the miso crepe thing didn't really taste like anything other than ham.

Maybe I need to give this place another try but other wise take a pass especially if their is a long line."}
{"text":"Be aware this place is tiny and quite a bit of a wait I have to say...they r know for their Benedict's and mexican dishes so definetly give those a try. I had the mirgas which was mexican rice, beans, scrambled eggs with sausage, salsa, sour cream and nacho chips...very filling and not too pricy for brunch...will come back and check this place out again."}
{"text":"I (like MANY Torontonians) love this cozy, home-y breakfast and brunch spot. It has an old-school diner feel, and yet the menu goes beyond the usual brunch standards. Service is always prompt and with a smile. 

Tons of reviews already, so I'll keep this review brief! 

- Brunch served everyday (not just weekends/holidays) 
- Lots of options to make dishes vegan (substitute scrambled tofu for eggs) and/or gluten-free. I have no dietary restrictions, but it's good to keep in mind if dining with friends who do. 
- The menu has the perfect balance of variety, including sweet/savoury and healthy vs. more indulgent options, without being so huge that it's overwhelming
- My favourites (which I usually order because you can't get them at other places) are the Huevos Migas and the Moroccan scramble. Both are very filling and delicious! The former has brown rice, tortilla chips, eggs, sausage, avocado (don't forget to ask for their habanero salsa!). The latter has eggs, olives, chickpeas, avocado, kale and spinach and comes with toast and salad. A huge and well-rounded breakfast for $12! 
- They have artwork on the walls for sale, and also sell handmade knit socks (random)
- CASH ONLY
- This place seems to almost ALWAYS be packed!! On weekends, show up when they open or be prepared to wait. I once went on a Saturday around 9am and it was already full with a lineup... I have only gone on weekdays when I have the day off. Even then, while there has never been a line, it gets quite full. 

There are a ton of overhyped brunch places in the city, where people line up, and I don't know why, because you can get good eggs benny practically anywhere. But I do find that Lady Marmalade offers something a bit different and is worth making the effort to visit."}
{"text":"This is a go-to place for all my visits to Toronto.

Their eggs benedict are perfectly cooked and the hollandaise just has the right amount of lemon / butter. 

My friends swear by the Huevos Rancheros as well so I think that's pretty good too.

Expect a wait!!"}
{"text":"We had an awesome brunch here last Saturday. I generally don't support lining up for brunch but in this case it was worth it. 

I had the spinach and cheddar waffles which included 3 medium-sized waffles, a salad, a huge amount of bacon, and roasted tomatoes. Great combination of flavours. (The dish would have been PERFECT with a little less cream sauce on the waffles, but next time I'll just ask for it on the side.) My friends had the huevos migas and liked their meals, as well. I ordered a side of poached eggs, they were good but totally unnecessary since my main meal was so large.

Service was friendly and reasonably quick considering the restaurant was 100% full.  Suggest getting there right when it opens at 8AM, there was a huge line when we left at 9.30!"}
{"text":"This was my second attempt coming to this place. Both times there was a long line up outside. Luckily I had time to burn. 

So glad I lined up. (About 30 mins)
Food and service were superb. 

Food came out quite quickly once I made the order. Went with the recommended Brie, avocado and bacon benny. $15.5 is a bit pricey for breakfast, but this thing was full of flavour. 

Great hollandaise sauce, well made eggs. Awesome bacon. And the avocado matches so incredibly well with the other ingredients. Small mixed greens is in miso dressing, and the home fries were very well done. A very complete and satisfying meal. 

4 out of 5 stars.

{"text":"Rude, condescending hostess. 

My boyfriend and I arrived at around noon, and the line was quite long. No big deal, but expecting a long wait and craving a morning caffeine-fix, we decided to grab a coffee at the Starbucks across the street to enjoy in the line-up. Unexpectedly, the line moved quickly, and we found ourselves next in line and still sipping our coffees. 

We were casually chatting with each other when the hostess/waitress came over and, interrupting our conversation without so much as an \"excuse me,\" rudely stated: \"You'll have to finish those Starbucks lattes before you sit down - no external drinks.\" I tried to explain that we had only bought them due to the long line and it was an accident that we ended up in the restaurant with them, but she walked away. Honestly expecting that I'd have to chug my coffee before being seated, I was surprised when, a few minutes later, the very same waitress approached and said, \"Okay, you guys can sit down now over there.\" Totally confused, I replied, \"Well, we haven't finished our coffees, so you (motioning to the people in line behind us) better take the table.\" She then looks at me like I'm a complete idiot and says, \"Well, it's not like I'm going to take them away from you!\"  

I understand why no external drinks are allowed in restaurants and I would never intentionally take a Starbucks coffee into a little locally-run place. But the hostess dealt with it horribly. She should never have told us we couldn't sit down with our coffees, and then publicly make me feel stupid when I took her seriously - particularly in front of other customers. This place has good food, but we'll probably opt to go somewhere else next time we're looking for a brunch spot."}
{"text":"I got some vacation time and we decided to try Lady Marmalade for brunch.  I've seen the lineups at this place on a weekend, so there is no way I am going to this place on a weekend, but Monday around 10ish seemed like a good time to go.

I had the impression that this was a vegetarian breakfast place and since I was on a vegan diet this week I decided to try it out - but I realized it's not a vegetarian place, which is okay too.  I tried their tofu scrambled \"eggs\" with bok choy, which tasted like a Chinese stir fry.  It came with a side of rice or potatoes, I chose potatoes but in hindsight I should've chosen rice had I known that it was just a stir fry with soy sauce.  The dish was good but was quite mismatched with a side of toast.

We tried this juice that had ginger in it, I think it was pineapple ginger?  It was great!  But super pricey at $4.75 for a glass.  This place overall is a bit pricier than what I am willing to pay for the quality of food.

If I get the chance to come back, while I'm not on a vegetarian diet, I may try their egg benedict dishes."}
{"text":"This place was on my to do list for almost a year. Finally I got the chance to go here with my friend. Hands down,it was the  best Benedict I had so far, everything was so fresh and delicious. Only downside to this place was the wait ( almost 30 min) and it's based on first come first serve. You can't do any reservation in advance. Oh BTW cash only , so don't forget to have cash with u. 
Definitely would come back to this place."}
{"text":"My friend and I tried two different versions of their eggs benedict. They have a build your own benny menu option which I would highly recommend! 

The portions are huge and great value for money! Also tried their london fog which was delicious

Only downfall is they have a small space for seating so they have longer wait times. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Overrated. Wait was forever. Music was horrible. Waiter wasn't friendly. Food was ok. Desserts like the bread pudding sound great but are disappointing. And they only take cash."}
{"text":"If you're coming here for brunch, be ready to wait a bit. Lady Marmalade is a small restaurant w/ limited seating but I promise you that it'll be worth the wait. Plus it wasn't so bad... About 15-20 mins?

One of my favs from brunch? The fluffy, soft bread pudding w/ wholesome pieces of strawberry & rhubarb!!! And fresh halves of strawberry & slices of apple and oranges on the side? Oh, yum!

The stuffed pepper special w/ chorizo and rice topped w/ melted cheese & a half avocado w/ a side of two poached eggs melted in my mouth... All on top of a bed of tortilla chips. Flavorful & savory in every bite. Aaaaand it comes w/ a side of pico de gallo & black beans. Dericious!

Overall, the price are very reasonable for large portions. And the staff is really friendly, which is always a plus, right?"}
{"text":"I have been there with a friend around 5 times now and by par this is the best Egg Benedict I have had. Tried 2 of their eggs beeny but my favourite is the Brie, Avacado, Bacon. First time in my life I talked about food having notes, each layer works very well. And their crepe croque monsieur is also another good one to try. They also have some good Mexican style breakfast huevos rancheritos & huevos migas. 
The place is busy on most days, we tend to be there around 10 on weekdays, so it might take 10 minutes for us to get a table. Pretty sure on other times it must be crazy busy. Be ready for lots of noise as the floor is hardwood and I have been told the sounds tends to bounce of it. But the food is worth the commotion. :)"}
{"text":"I don't really do lineups for eggs, so I avoided this place for the longest time... And only really hurt myself. The backup breakfast next door is fine, but if you wake up early enough to avoid the backlog, this place does stuff with breakfast food that will make your weekend. Fave would be the cheddar spinach waffles, and a.m poutine is ridiculous. A must try. Must eat. Must still try to avoid lines."}
{"text":"The food was awesome! The service was great!! And the music was spot on!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Lady Marmalade makes excellent breakfast food. Everything I've had there has been delicious and I appreciate that there are lots of vegetarian options. Prices are pretty good.

Despite a favourable view of the food, there are some negative aspects of this establishment that should be addressed. Like every other decent brunch place in the city, the lines can be very long. They don't make fried eggs here and it makes me wonder how skilled or qualified the kitchen staff is when they're not willing to make fried eggs. Finally, cash only is an annoyance for most people nowadays. I always end up walking to the bank while a friend waits in line"}
{"text":"Lady Marmalade... I don't think of the song by Xtina Aguilera & the crew anymore, when I hear this heavenly name. 
Lady Marmalade. 

Avocado & brie poached egg benedict.
Tortita Gordita Sandwich
Conchita Pibil Pulled Pork
And that amazing salad with the sesame dressing..

I can't. I simply cannot. I'm obsessed. 

This is, hands down, the best brunch food I have ever had. Yes. It is so good I cannot stand to think of it, for the yearning takes over my soul.

HOWEVER: the joy of food perfection, does come in the form of a tiny-miny restaurant, which cannot fit larger groups than 5-6 people at the same table, and where you are most likely to wait at least 15-20 minutes before getting a table because it is so small. But that only gives to the charm of it all, I'd say.
I do appreciate the fact that they have stayed on the East End, making it single-handedly the most popular/famous East End brunch place, but also that they stick to their guns and do not want to expand. I think that is commendable. 
We're small, but we're effin' amazing. 

Go there. Eat the food. Fall in love. And you'll probably bump into me sooner or later. Cause I'm there. Always...and Forever. Lady... Ok, this is gettin' wonky.
But seriously, it's amazing. Rant. OVER."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about personally. I've been here several times - different days of the week, different times of day, different dishes - and have never been excited.

Once, when my sister politely asked for a small substitution due to allergies, they declined rather rudely. Not impressed. Food selection is standard, and why on earth do they not take credit/debit?

I'd recommend giving it a shot if you're in the area - but don't wait in line."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this spot yet. One of my favourite brunch spots in the city. This small place pushes out huge flavours and dishes! Depending on the day my order varies but everything is delicious and flavourful. Their in house fresh beet juice is always good. Lots of vegan options as well. For the first time today I tried their meatball sandwich, it's 11pm and I'm still thinking about it-that alone speaks for itself. 
Until next time xo."}
{"text":"Get there early on the weekends, long line-ups. Worth the wait. I love the simple breakfast of poached eggs with the spicy sausage. Keeps me guilt free from a sauce soaked eggs benny!  There coffee is great."}
{"text":"Crowded inside so we waited ~20 mins for a table for 2. Didn't mind too much there was some standing room indoors but not much. Line formed behind us and some were outside (thankfully it wasn't a bad day out). Great little brunch spot once you get a table, menu is short and simple and most things are either healthy or not healthy but have rich ingredients. 

The kitchen is open so the smell of the eggs and meats and waffles fills the place up. Service is average, but a little rushed due to so many tables being waited by 4-5 girls. 
Ordered the strawberry banana bread pudding which was amazing and unique. Syrup complimented it well as well fresh sliced fruits with it. Sister ordered the spinach waffles and it came with an asian inspired leafy salad with sesame dressing. Again good tasting, unique flavors. 
Overall for the price paid I doubt I'd be back here again. It wasn't break your wallet pricey but not something a normal workin youngin can afford regularly. Go once to taste the food, experience the hype and then you'll be good..... if there isn't an hr long line atleast"}
{"text":"My husband & I went here to have a quick breakfast but we didn't realize that the line up would be crazy. Lined up for almost an hour, once seated the server immediately approached us. We ordered a crepe monseiur, eggs bene with mango salsa & bacon and bread pudding to share. The bread pudding flavour is peanut butter, banana &chocolate which is so good. I hope I can copy that one. It a bit pricey compared to your regular breakfast resto but its worth it as the food is really good. If you like spicy food on even bother touching the shiracha, go for their habanero hot sauce."}
{"text":"I feel like a jilted lover.  I got caught up in Lady Marmalade's seduction.  The delightful hollandaise  sitting atop perfectly cooked poached eggs is sinfully delicious.  The potatoes are prepared and seasoned wonderfully.

I recently went with a colleague for a breakfast meeting.  Crackdowns at work make the need for a receipt more essential then ever.  Knowing from experience that they are cash only (annoying) and that they don't take reservations (also annoying), I suppose I shouldn't have been shocked when they refused to split the bill. I get it...if you take a credit card and you are busy and 8 people want a separate bill I can somewhat understand.  On the other hand, if there are 2 people during a less than busy time in a CASH ONLY joint, not separating a bill is nothing short of PRETENTIOUS.    

Lady Marmalade..you're a pretty woman with a less than pretty personality."}
{"text":"I have been a few times and had the tofu scramble which is fabulous. The restaurant environment is a great one to be in, very relaxing. Everything is cooked perfectly and the portion is massive. Friendly staff - would highly recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian like me and struggle to find a good place to eat brunch with your egg-loving friends, fear not. This place serves amazing Cheddar&Spinach waffles. Generous portion sizes and friendly stuff add to the positive experience.
Minus 1 star for not accepting cards and lack of interior design."}
{"text":"First time coming to Lady Marmalade and the experience we had was a good one. This is located in the heart of Leslieville and is quite the popular spot for brunch! Many Yelp reviews and Google reviews that this is a must if you're in the area and want good brunch. 
There is a line situation here and first-come, first-serve for a table. So line up and wait. We arrived around 11 on a week day and it wasn't super packed, but there was a small line. I think we waited about 10-15 min for a table which isn't too bad. 

The place is cash-only so be prepared to pay with cash. The menu offers up some traditional brunch plates, to make-your-own Bennys, and many of the items are vegetarian. I got the Moroccan Scramble but with made it vegan with tofu scramble and got an extra side of fruit.

When you add in sides, drinks, etc it can get pretty pricey, but the portion size is decent and the food is filling so we left feeling satiated. Our service was pretty spot-on and we were in/out in a reasonable amount of time.

I can see this place being hit or miss, but I would recommend it for people in the area!"}
{"text":"Incredible brunch! I love this little place. While visiting friend they took us here to start the day. I had a waffle with spinach and a light orange cream sauce which was perfectly done and a wonderful blend of flavors. My beautiful wife and our friend both had the Mexican meatball soup. I tried a bite and my head almost exploded with joy. I immediately became jealous that I didn't order this.
Staff was friendly and efficient and the atmosphere was casual and friendly. The only downside is that like many places in this area it was cash only. 
Go here. Bring cash. Enjoy.
I shall return."}
{"text":"My go-to brunch place in leslieville! I usually get the roasted vegetable eggs benny - you can't really go wrong. Recently I opted for the pulled pork and enjoyed the first one but it got kind of salty when I was getting onto the second one. 

Most definitely recommend this place! Just be prepared to wait a little."}
{"text":"The Mecca of Brunch in Toronto you say? An hour plus wait on a Sunday you say? An hour wait? Well, then it must be amazing! It must be the best brunch I am EVER going to have IN MY DAMN LIFE. Brunch that makes me die and float to heaven. Brunch that is so good, that I don't understand what to do with myself and just wander around the city in a daze, wondering whether I ever have to eat again because dammit...I'VE HAD BRUNCH AT LADY MARMALADE!

Was it AMAZONG BRUNCH? Nope, it was not amazing
Was it FUCKING GOOD BRUNCH? Nope, not even fucking good brunch.
Was it a good brunch? Yea, I guess it was good, closer to okay.

BUT NOT AMAZING. So yea, I dunno, maybe the hour wait on a Sunday created this absurd expectation, but when we were finally seated, and ordered our food and drinks (service was rushed (duh, it's a sunday afternoon), but the server was polite and bubbly. The wait for food was a touch on the longer side, and when I got my Huevos Migas and started to dig in, my soul made a sad deflated balloon sound and I wondered \"Oh, this is it? This is the best Toronto has to offer? Oh. Okay. *Cries into plate*

Don't get me wrong, the food was cooked well, my eggs were saucy and cheesy and creamy and had a nice ratio of everything, the tortilla chips were crispy and generally yum, and my refried black beans were...beany, but over all, it wasn't anything to write home about.

I'd recommend coming here on a weekday afternoon or something."}
{"text":"Incredible value here. Love Love Love. Leslieville STAPLE. 

VIBE 
So warm and inviting. Lots of families here too but not in an annoying way. There's a cute little alcove for kids to run under and chalk. The bright green walls now display some fantastic 3-D photography. It's something you have to see for yourself. And yes, there usually is always a line up. Try to get here before 10 if you can. If you're in a rush, don't come here. It's busy and because the food is so good, it's going to take some time.  I like the round tables. Nice touch. 

WE ATE
A LOT! My friend and I got one savoury dish and one sweet dish.  
The order: 

Beet, Apple Ginger Juice. OMG. It tasted like it was literally out of the garden. Lovely. 

Huevos Migas 3 soft-scrambled eggs w/ cheese, tomatoes, scallions & sausage, 
served w/ basmati brown rice, smashed black beans, sour cream, pico de gallo salsa. & organic corn tortilla chips.  This is a VERY big plate. I loved the soft scramble. There is a LOT of cilantro on top. Like cilantro city.  Too many black beans for my liking. The rice was OK but I'm not used to basmati. I'd still get it for the soft scramble. 
We added guac to the menu. It was hidden under the mass of food we got. I would advise to ask for it in a separate bowl. I didn't feel like it was a lot but it probably was (or maybe I just love guac that much). 

We saw the other table get a number of sweet items. The parfait looked phenomenal  (with a bagel hanging from the straw of the parfait glass!). We ordered looking at the crepe. 

So we had the organic buckwheat fresh fruit crepe w/ lemony yogurt, house-made 
cranberry-almond granola, berry coulis & honey.   
I felt like the crepe could have been \"stronger\" but it's buckwheat we're talking about, organic at that so it didn't hold the ingredients that well. Friend said it could have been a bit \"warmer.\" It was still a really nice and healthy dish. Yummy and a nice complement to the savoury. 

Since these dishes didn't come with potatoes, we got them on the side. Man, they're a bit spicy! But tasty and not too big of a dish. That said, I couldn't finish them with all of the food we had. 
I need to come back here and get that poutine! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
You'll need to take a walk afterwards. It's really a win on all fronts. One of the best brunch spots in the city and definitely Leslieville. If you can withstand the wait. 
NOTES: Cash only (there is is a TD Bank nearby) and they won't seat you until the whole party is there."}
{"text":"A long wait for brunch.  Not worth it.  I mean it's good but not worth an hour wait.  If you want to just try this restaurant out, go after 230pm so there's no line up.  Because by the time we get in and sit down,  it's around that time anyways."}
{"text":"A bit of a wait for Sunday morning brunch but definitely worth it! Had the pulled pork benedict and BF had the french toast, both were really good! Good service as well! Only 4 stars because I thought the potatoes weren't crunchy enough."}
{"text":"I finally met Lady Marmalade today. She welcomed me with her open arms and gave me the warmest hug. She seated me near her opulent window and served me her Crepe Croque Monsieur, which was perfectly priced, hot, savoury, and Hoooey Goooey good. My visit was indeed well over due!"}
{"text":"A little bit of a line up but we got in. The food is worth the wait for 15 minutes. I ordered the spinach and cheddar waffle. It is a savory waffle dressed with green onion. Loved it. Got the avocado instead of bacon and added two poached eggs. Very filling. They have their own hot sauce too."}
{"text":"The best:
Quote of the day from the waitress here: \"The hot sausages aren't like, burn your face hot, but they've got a little kick!\"

The good:
- I love how their laminated menus feel.  It's like a matte lamination that is 'soft' if that makes sense (and we both know that it doesn't!)
- The menu here is also fabulous in terms of content.  There is a vegetarian scramble that uses tofu.  A myriad of eggs bennys.  Some lovely salads.  A respectable selection of sandwiches.  The menu is vast yet carefully selected.
- The music was excellent.  Rolling Stones were playing while I ate.
- The staff is super friendly, and even though the place was packed full (on a Tuesday at 1130), the waitress was always by to make sure I was taken care of.
- The decor is also really cool.  The chairs are really funky, and everything seems really old but really clean.
- Serviceable cappuccino!  Colour me surprised!  I caught a glimpse of a serious burr grinder behind the coffee bar too.  Too much foam for my liking, but it is hard to microbubble skim milk.
- My breakfast came with a little salad.  I am used to getting 'free salad' (I like to call salads that don't go with your meal/you don't expect 'free salads') that are bad.  The standard would be wilty/brown iceburg lettuce and italian dressing.  This salad was far from that pathethic offering.  It was fresh, leafy greens with lots of mixed veggies (carrots, some sprouty things I don't know about etc...) with an amazing sweet and tangy dressing.  The free salad here... was top notch. 
- Bread from St. Johns Bakery - they are buying from their neighbours in the community; it was a really nice touch.

The bad:
- The hashbrowns here were weak.  They were on the 'bad' side of the scale.  I don't look forward to having them again, and I generally accept any type of potato.  These were hardish in the middle and the 'spice' on them was flavourless.  They are actually some of the best looking and worst tasting hashbrowns ever.
- {rant} There were way to many kids here.  I am sick of pretending that that is not a negative at eateries - it is.  I don't have kids - if you do have kids and take them to a restaraunt, it's fine if they sit at the table and behave (usually they must be greater than 3 years old for this to be possible).  If you let them run around like wild chickens, I hate your kids and think less of you.  If they scream and you don't take them outside, you're a douche and it affects my meal.  If I ate in the mcDonalds play castle or at Chuck E Cheese, it would be a problem with me.  If I am eating at a restaurant in an adult area, it's a problem with you.{/rant} There are too many kids here.  Even in the middle of the week.

The strange-but-fine:
- There are no fried eggs.  You can have scrambled or poached.  I had mine poached, and they were perfect.  They were still runny enough to dip toast into, and I actually really preferred the poached eggs to the fried eggs now that I've had them!

This is a 4 star place.  Something is making me underrate it, and I'm not sure if it's the family atmosphere or the bad hashbrowns, but if this joint was a breakfast bar on an adults only cruise ship with some type of better potato offering, I would come aboard as the musical entertainment for a journey around the world in 80 (+) days."}
{"text":"Breakfast brunch hot spot for Leslievillagers! I don't think I have ever seen this place without a line up. 

Once I had the patient to wait 20 minutes before sitting down, I was able to see what all the fuss was about.

The place is quaint, with mismatched tables and chairs and art for sale on the walls (I did purchase a FANTASTIC pair of wooly socks for TEN BUCKS that were hanging on the wall! Am wearing them right now- heavenly!). The place feels like home or a friends house, welcoming in new comers easily. 

The portions are large and relatively healthy. Lentil soup was delish! The waitstaff were super friendly and very accommodating and don't sneer at you for taking your time regardless of the line outside the door. Breakfasts are a sway away from your usual brunch joints and it's nice to get a burst of flavor rather than the same ol' eggs and toast."}
{"text":"Whoa great brunch spot. Would definitely go back - not that expensive either . Amazing late! Great Benny with mango ! Delish"}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of friends on a sunday morning.  

+ Wait was exactly what they told us it would be and no longer.
+ Waitress happily exchanged the mango salsa my dish came with for pico de gallo at my request, and the cooks asked her to find out how the dish was with the sub.  Love that they were curious about how the customer liked the finished product and didn't just shrug off an unusual request.  HATE when places get picky about substitutions so this was great.
+ Waitstaff were extremely attentive and polite but did not rush us out.
+ My water glass was never empty.  That might sound like nothing but I drink a huge amount of water so if the waitstaff can keep up with me, that's a HUGE point in their favour.
+ All of us loved our food and drink, including my hot apple cider which was absolutely MARVELLOUS.

- Wish there was more space inside to wait on a cold morning.

All in all, great place.  We'll be back without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot in the outskirts of downtown Toronto. The eggs Benedict was awesome. Great flavor. Little bit on the pricey side but well worth every penny. You have to try it if you are in the area or out of town. Get there early because most of the time there is a line I heard. Service is awesome and it should be for a great brunch spot. Get there early! Trust me"}
{"text":"Unpretentious. Love the laid back atmosphere. Good comfort food. The kind for a lazy day brunch date."}
{"text":"Pretty good quality loose leaf tea, bottomless coffee. Eggs benny at around $13. Tasty but mediocre. And they're cash only. They get really busy and some of the clientele get pushy and rude with the waitstaff (maybe because they're hungry). The eggs benny were pretty good but nothing I couldn't get anywhere else. The dressing on the salad was reminiscent of something I made at home, just not as good as mine and way too salty. Also the potatoes were very bland and dried out. 

A seat by the open window is a good idea. The place is small and fills up quickly so you might want to go early or not at all otherwise you'll be waiting around.

I don't see myself going back here. On the plus side, they're open at 8am which is earlier than many other breakfast/brunch places."}
{"text":"I don't get all these reviews that go on for days. Here is what you need to know: If you don't like eggs Benedict don't come here. This is not a lunch place. The eggs Bennie are good and the hollandaise is well put together. It's a little lacking in lemon but it tastes good. The bacon is overcooked so don't order anything with it."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Tip- come here early to avoid the line up.

I've walked by this place around brunch before and the line ups are usually out the front door and over an hour long, came here at 8am on a Saturday and there was no line so we were quite happy to be out of the cold. 

Service: Good. Prompt and friendly. Food and drinks came quickly as well.

Drinks: average. I had the honey ginger tea and just regular coffee with bottomless refills for the bf.

Food: I can understand why this place gets so many great reviews as it's hard to find a place that makes a good eggs Benny. 

I ordered the Avocado, Brie and Bacon Eggs Benny- however I was a bit disappointed.. although I love the ingredients in a sandwich, I don't think I like them on my eggs Benny.. that's not exactly why I'm giving a 3.5 though.. wish the hollandaise sauce had more flavour to it. Secondly, the side salad wasn't anything fancy.. they used a ginger, garlic, apple cider vinegar dressing with sesame seeds-which tasted standard compared to Japanese restaurant side salads..I've been to breakfast places with exceptional hollandaise sauces or exceptional salad dressings..

The bf's mango hollandaise sauce was more flavourful and blended better with the Benny.. 

Would recommend this place if you're looking for a good breakfast place, but don't think it would be worth the line up if I had to wait in line.."}
{"text":"Love brunch places and this place was both cozy and had something different but delicious to offer! Definitely has that diner feel but with a modern twist. Food was amazing..I had the bennies with avocado and Brie..delish!!!! Came with potatoes..done perfectly..and a small salad (brunch with salad was a no go for me..otherwise plate would have been perfect!)

Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I was influenced to eat here because it was featured in You Gotta Eat Here. It was a bit busy for a Thursday morning but I was seated within 5 minutes. I got a very welcoming and cozy vibe when I entered. Since they had a limited amount of tables, they offered to seat me beside a couple at a 4-seat table. 

My server asked if I wanted any drinks, I just said water but he never gave it. I guess he assumed I would share the pitcher of water from the couple sitting beside me.

I ordered the Lady Marmalade Bennies with bacon and cheddar (additional $2.50). It came with potatoes and a salad. The salad was kinda plain, it didn't taste amazing but it wasn't horrible. The potatoes were pretty good. The Bennies were amazing! The best Eggs Benedict I have ever tasted, definitely worth it.

Also, they use natural ingredients in their dishes which is a bonus."}
{"text":"We came hungry and early enough on a Saturday to only wait for 25 minutes in the lineup. We had the benny and a breakfast poutine. Both dishes tasted fresh and stood out from your typical brunch menus. We left satisfied with our bellies giggling in delight."}
{"text":"I don't really get it.  Every weekend I see the line ups and ponder the following question: what do other people see in this place that I don't?

Yes, the ingredients are good, so I will give it credit for that.  But I have been here three times, each time ordering a different dish and each time my food has been meh.  My most recent visit, I tried the crepe croque monsieur and I couldn't even finish half of it.  The limp spinach draped over it should have been my warning.  Everything about it was... soggy.  It reminded me that the waffles I had ordered last time were also soggy.  

And the service is nothing to right home about either.  The taking of our order was prompt and painless, but I'll be damned if anyone offered to refill my coffee.

No, I would never line up for this place."}
{"text":"This is a 5-star place that gets knocked for endless lines. Get there early.

Great food and better service. Very happy."}
{"text":"Another overrated brunch place that takes too long to get a seat. I don't even remember what I ate to be honest. They have free coffee refills :) 

Decent brunch place, not much selection to choose from, would of been great if it wasn't for the line up"}
{"text":"Lady M, oh Lady M... my sweet sweet Lady M.. what can I say.. ? One of my absolute favourite go-to brunch spots in the city... stumbled across this place on a weekday morning after having dropped off my car for service and was checking out the strip for something different and unique... The digs are totally mismatched and kitschy on the inside, with a complete retro throwback of formica tables and turquoise and patterned, mismatched, (p)leather chairs... but the ecclectic vibe totally works and it's a place I keep on frequenting... although if going during peak times, get ready to wait, as the lineups are always crazy, but totally worth the wait.. 

So far, everything I've tried has been uber delicious!!: good morning poutine (hashbrowns doused in aged white cheddar and hollandaise or miso gravy - NOTE: If you want to try this deliciousness, they do not serve it on weekends..), the Baja rice bowl (one of my personal favourites), huevos rancheritos, and any of the eggs bennies - SO good, it's not even funny.. I don't know how they make their hollandaise sauce; all I know is it's DAMN good.. 

Things to note: go before peak time (morning during the week if you want to avoid waits), they only accept cash, and a reco NOT to go towards the end of the day. Have gone a couple of times an hour to a half hour before closing; the service was TERRIBLE, the food was cold and bland (tasted like they literally took black beans out of a can and microwaved them straight), teeny portions (which was ok, considering the food wasn't good) and we got quite a bit of attitude from our server for showing up late. Although even given this bad experience on several occasions, I still give it a 5 star and keep on going back, as its totally worthy during times other than an hour before closing and the food is really, really delish! Just writing this review is making me hungry.. :)"}
{"text":"This will be short and sweet.  This is an amazing breakfast place.  (I've only been for breakfast so that's all I can comment on.)  To start with I am so glad my friend arrived 30 minutes early because on the weekends there is at least a forty-five minute wait but man is it worth it?  It seems like the specialty for brunch is either a gourmet eggs benedict or a mexican dish (e.g., Huevos rancheros).  I had a special: fried chicken eggs benedict or Bennie as per Lady Marmalade lingo.  It was absolutely excellent.  The service was prompt and cheerful.  They only accept cash so bring some.  I am not sure I would wait 45 minutes in the rain or cold for this but it was really good and relatively inexpensive."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

Lady Marmalade has been well known to me and this past Sunday, I decided to trek across all of Toronto to join the line up.  Lady Marmalade has a few \"oftens\"... its often on the top Toronto brunch list, it often has a line up, and it is often a terrible rainy Sunday this to line up for brunch.  Well after going, I do understand why it's on the top brunch list and why some people have lined up over an hour in the rain.

It opens super early at 8 am and its not unusual to see the line up start before it opens.  We arrived at 8:30 am and the line up was already out the door.  We had about 4 groups before us and the place already packed.  Service here is fairly fast to keep all the tables moving.  I will say  it is super family friendly as half the tables had a baby or toddler and throwing food everywhere.  Kudos to the staff that patiently step aside the mess and then spend another 10 minutes after they leave to clean up everything.  

In addition to being family friendly, it has a very old school worn and weathered diner vibe.  Don't expect visuals to be draw.. it's all about the food and quick service.  The menu is concise with a lot of vegetarian offerings.  As we were ordering, we saw a few plates come out and they looked quite large... and I can definitely confirm THEY'RE BIG!  

Moroccan Scramble - 2 eggs gently scrambled with spinach, kale, tomato, olives, and chickpeas.  It also comes with 2 slices of toast, a generous side salad, and a large slice of avocado.  This is one of the better egg dishes I had recently.  Though it is super lightly spiced, the addition of olives helped the dish give it a punch of flavour.  The eggs were gently cooked so it wasn't chewy or overcooked.  They offered this as a vegetarian dish by swapping out the egg for tofu.  4.5/5

Strawberry Banana bread pudding - This was soooooo huge!  It came with a small bottle of maple syrup and a fruit salad.  There was two very large pieces of the bread pudding.  I loved how they used real strawberries instead of jams or pre-made packaged fillings.  You can taste that it is homemade because it had a slight sour note of using not quite in season local ones.  It's a nice thing as the sugar overloaded fake ones dont have a real flavour other than 'sweet'.  This was quite rich as the custard just soaked all the way through and made for a rich start to the day.  4.5/5

Service here is quick and attentive for clearing the plates quickly and grabbing whatever you need.  I wish this was in the west end or take reservations cause i'd like to try out more of the menu.  It's just too bad I have to trek across GTA here and fight through the line!"}
{"text":"I had the Eggs Benedict with bacon and I didn't find it to be outstanding. The hollandaise sauce wasn't anything to rave about. The potatoes weren't anything special either. The eggs were cooked perfectly (runny centre). The salad that came with it was a japanese carrot dressing, and I eat japanese salads a lot so I was dissapointed. I would have rather have had a garden or ceasar salad, but I can understand why others would like it seeing as though I've had that a fair amount before. It was a good eggs benny dish, but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Two guests at 11:30 am on Saturday.

Service: 
Nothing spectacular, but nothing bad either. It was warm outside so the \"dreaded\" line wasn't much of a challenge. Although maybe they should get  a new door that opens outward, I got trapped behind it :(

Food: 
Almost perfect! I got the eggs benny with bacon, spinach and cheddar. The Hollandaise sauce was just perfect, exactly what I was expecting with a nice bright lemony taste. But somewhere in the sauce, my cheddar lost all it's taste. Now that I think about it, I'm not even sure it was cheddar...whatever cheese it was it was lost on the plate. The bacon actually tasted like bacon, you'll know what I mean when you enjoy some.

My dining companion got to enjoy poached eggs for the first time! I forgot what he ordered but he loved it! The salad was interesting and enjoyable. Next time maybe I'll opt for the tomato slices.

Our only complaint about the whole experience was the dry and horribly starchy potatoes. We mentioned it to our waitress, who didn't seem too concerned and sort of apologized. For my breakfast the potatoes, though horrible, helped soak up my delicious yolk and Hollaindaise sauce making it quite bearable. But not so much for my friend's breakfast which was sauceless. I'd like to have seen something comped or been offered a free cup of coffee, but whatever.

Next time I'll get the eggs benny with double bacon and spinach, tomato slices instead of the salad and NO POTATOES PLEASE!"}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.

Lined up an hour for this brunch, and although the food was good I wouldn't say it was worth the wait. Not sure if it's because this place has such good reviews on yelp I expected it to be really good, but after my visit last weekend I do think it is slightly over-hyped.

Signature Eggs Benny ($15.50)
Tried the daily's special, which was sun dried tomato pesto, bacon eggs benedict. I thought the poached eggs were slightly small in comparison to the size of the toasted egg muffin. The hollandaise sauce was good though - at most restaurants hollandaise is tasteless, but here the hollandaise had some flavor and didn't taste too buttery. It was served with potatoes and a side salad. The salad had a sesame kind of dressing, similar to the salad dressings they serve at japanese restaurants. 

Crepe Croque Monsieur ($12.50)
Not your traditional croque monsieur. A ham and aged white cheddar crepe, topped in miso-scallion cream, poached eggs and spinach served with potatoes on the side. The crepe was tasty - soft and soggy as expected as it was drenched in the cream sauce. I liked how it came with the poached eggs and spinach, although it didn't complement or was relevant to the crepe."}
{"text":"Came here with the wife and kid a couple Saturdays ago on the recommendation of a co-worker.  We were surprised by the line outside, altogether we waited a good 45 - 50 minutes before we were seated.

We had a pretty good idea what we wanted since there was ample time to look over the menu as we stood in line.

We opted for the Tomato, cream cheese and pesto benny.  Given how busy the place was we were surprised with how fast we received our food.  We didn't even have to make use of the free coffee refills!

The Food: The egg was poached well with great shape and a beautifully runny yolk.  The Hollandaise was rich and creamy and the pesto spread was sharp and fragrant.  Great texture from the egg to the English muffin.

Without hesitation - 5/5"}
{"text":"Amazing Asian salad, soup and Thai slaw
Great flavours!!! Also the Mexican breakfast is awesome it even comes with real tortillas, fresh avocado think beans too. So great. Only thing is there are huge lineups especially on the weekends. And you may find it annoying to not be able to get a Ceasar because there's no liquor license. Otherwise it's great"}
{"text":"Had been hearing about this spot for a while, so I gave it a shot for the first time yesterday, and I'm impressed. It's a great little trendy Leslieville location, and my first impression was that it's exactly the kind of relaxing, casual brunch spot I want to find myself at on a lazy Sunday morning. Chalkboard specials, a nice lookout view of Queen East, mismatched chairs and tables, and families couples of all types. 

The menu was great, I actually had a hard time picking what I wanted to eat. Several types of all kinds of your standard brunch classics, including five or six kinds of eggs benny. I opted for an Avocado Brie Bacon Eggs Benedict, while my two compatriots had the Vanilla Raspberry French Toast and the Baked Crepe Croque Monsieur.

All three were on the best side of great: The french toast was dense, flaky and almost pastry-like, and soaked up the (\"real and organic\", according to our waitress) maple syrup as a french toast should. The poached eggs on both the Croque Monsieur and Eggs Benny properly popped into a river of runny egg yolks just the right consistency, and the hollandaise sauce on the Eggs Benedict was also appropriately thick and zingy. A little lemony, a little spicy. Pretty much exactly what I think a proper hollandaise sauce should be. Everything else was similarly right on cue.

The one notable let down for us was the potatoes -- all three of us agreed that while serviceable, they weren't the best we've ever had. They were \"just potatoes\". Roasted, and lightly fried and seasoned, but without any real texture to speak of. Not a huge blight, but there it is for those of you who really appreciate your hash browns and potato wedges crispy. 

Great little spot, highly recommended if you, like me, have an addiction to hunting out good brunch spots in the city."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my second outing to this eastern outpost of brunch. It was as good as the first time.  I had the Heuvos Migas which was a score. There was a lineup but I was down with that. Truly a hubbub inside as we took our seats and marveled at the quick and efficient service."}
{"text":"For brunch, this place is almost too good to be true. Friendly service? Amazing food? Reasonable prices? Check, check, check. Of course, there's always a majorly long line. I used to scoff at the suckers who took up residence on the sidewalk on a precious weekend morning when they could be scarfing food down their traps elsewhere. But now, I've become one of them, and I scoff at the suckers missing out on the experience of brunching here. 

I stood in line in the freezing cold for 30 minutes one day to eat Huevos Rancheritos. Then I came back the very next day to do it all over again. 3 soft and fluffy scrambled eggs with guacamole, beans, salsa, a whole wheat tortilla, and (my favourite) a nice pile of cilantro on top. SO GOOD. Love that there are a variety of veg-friendly options on the menu, although the thought of straying from my tried-and-true favourite pains my heart. 

Looks like the eggs bennies are also quite popular here, and I've heard great things about the sandwiches as well. Come here a bit early and prepared for a wait, but trust that the Lady will do you right."}
{"text":"This place has been on the Toronto brunch scene forever, and always seems to be at the top of every list. Unfortunately, I have always lived west of Yonge. We don't tend to make it to Leslieville all that often. So it was a much delayed visit, but it had to happen and I'm glad it did. 

I came here around lunch time mid-week. It seemed a bit busy as it was just before winter holidays, but we only waited about 20 mins for a table (which sure beats the lineups out the door on weekends). It had been a while since I had an eggs benny, and I heard LM made a great one, so my choice was almost made for me.

The Benny was delicious. Great combination of flavours, and I don't know how else to put this, but it was easy to cut through. Sometimes, cutting through a Benny can be a messy affair, okay? Layers sliding all over the place until your Benedict is just a mashed heap of its former self. Not this one. Of course, the flavour of it is what's going to convince me to trek back out east once more - looking forward to the next time I can give Lady Marmalade a try!"}
{"text":"I started to lick my plate clean, but happy GF advised against it. ;-(
The spinach and cheddar waffle with crispy bacon was delicious, washed down with a surprisingly refreshing cold beet-apple-ginger juice.
GF's self chosen/constructed eggs benny was and equal hit !
Now I understand why people line up, although if you go mid-week like we did, at an off hour...FAST seating !
Service +food + price = WE'LL BE BACK !!!"}

A nice change of pace when your going out for breakfast/brunch. 

Will return."}
{"text":"Bit if a wait, friendly staff, fresh food, bring cash, have a great time!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast/brunch/everything food! Too delicious! Caters to all options of eating lifestyles; meat eaters, vegetarians, vegans. 
Try it out my fellow Torontonians :)"}
{"text":"I've waited 3 years to try this place -- it's found on every top 10 brunch list for Toronto but has eluded me since I moved to the city thanks to it's consistent hour long wait and a husband who won't wait more than 30 minutes to eat anywhere. So last weekend, while my husband was away on business, I finally had the opportunity to check it out with some less impatient friends. When we arrived around 2 pm on a sunny Sunday afternoon, the wait was a mere 45 minutes and we were thrilled. With all this anticipation that has built-up, I found the meal and the service to be underwhelming. The menu has a Mexican theme so I opted for the cochinita torta with a side salad (it was almost 3 pm and I was ready for lunch). My friends meanwhile sampled one of the many Benny options on the menu. The food arrived promptly but was short on flavor and flair. Service was average (not quite friendly but not quite rude). Overall nothing to write home about...so spare yourself the wait in line next time you're thinking about it!"}
{"text":"First off, I'm not going to comment on the long line-ups on the weekend for brunch.  Why?  Never been there on the weekend, I prefer to go during the week when I know I won't have to wait to get my hands on their amazing Eggs Benedict creations.
The service has always been excellent and very accommodating, great staff!
I also like that they are very kid friendly, they have a number of colour books/story books crayons and chalk for the blackboard to keep the little ones occupied.  That is very important and a very nice touch for people dining with small children.
I love their coffee, such rich deep flavour not watered down hot bean juice.  I haven't tried a lot of their menu over the years because I have my favourites.  But, I really need to deviate from that to try some of the other dishes that are so popular with other Yelp users.
I usually order the Yucatecan Pulled Pork Eggs Benny, it is sooooo good.  The slightly spicy pulled pork goes so well with the Hollandaise Sauce and Rich Egg Yolk.  topped off with citrus marinaded red onions to add some freshness and acid.  So tasty!  It's served with a nice fresh side of greens with a soy based dressing that is quite flavourful and the standard potatoes to help sop up the wonderful leftover Hollandaise and Egg Yolks."}
{"text":"Let's cut to the chase here: would I wait for a table here? No.

The thing is, you don't have to. Weekday brunch is the best thing ever. It was still pretty crowded, but there was no waiting.

A friend had just been talking about savory waffles, so that was clearly what I had to order. It was a good choice (although mine weren't as photogenic as Instagram suggested they would be).

My food was really good. As was the coffee. It's a solid brunch choice, but I don't understand the hype."}
{"text":"After seeing all the positive reviews here, I wanted to check this place out.  Well, not really, but my brother did, so we went.  Monday morning, packed.  Cash only, not great.  Usually cash only means better prices, but not here.  For just under $30 had we each had the hash browns with two eggs.  In a fancy restaurant I could maybe see that...maybe, but this is not at all fancy.  And they called what we had  poutine, which it was far from.  For a small, crowded, expensive joint, it was absolutely not worth the money, and I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"The Aged Cheddar and Spinach Waffles are brilliant. I also enjoy the salad with the sesames that comes on the side. 

Scallions are a staple for most dishes. They had the most wonderful Potato and Scallion soup today. I didn't order it, but my brother did, and I swear I ate half of his."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Came here on Wednesday afternoon around 1:30pm for brunch, and there was still a bit of a wait! Party of three. Was seated after about 20 minutes, so not bad at all compared to the infamous Sunday lineup. I ordered the mango salsa, cheddar and bacon benny and it was SO delicious though my eggs were a little under (the whites were a bit runny). My friends ordered the spinach waffle (first time it came burnt but they made a new one and apologized about the burnt waffle) and avocado brie benny which she said was pretty good. Home fries were a little odd and mushed. Cash only, no separate bills - kind of a hassle. Not sure if I'll be back in the near future due to the various inconveniences but boy was that mango salsa benny amazing!"}

*Lil' Kim moves NSFW*

Lady Marmalade has been playing hard to get with me.  Three separate weekend attempts to get in were met with lines that our wake-up blood sugar couldn't hold out for.  New strategy: weekday visit!

Today, one of my bestest buds and I mapped out a plan:

Variable one: eat brunch at Lady Marmalade
Variable two: do some day drinking and park sitting
Intended result: best Tuesday in a long time

Easy enough equation, right?  

Foolproof, it turns out.  

Strolling in eleven-ish we had no problem getting a table by the window.  We both had coffees (bottomless, with a food order) and *stressed* over the menus.  Seriously: concerned faces, frowns, and maybe even some head scratching for dramatic effect.  How to choose?  EVERYTHING, GET IN MAH BELLY! (said no one, thought everyone)

Ultimately we opted for:

Huevos rancheros: perfectly scrambled eggs, mild but deeply flavoured salsa, whole wheat tortilla, guac and - the unexpected star of the plate - black beans

Gordita sandwich with salad: baguette stuffed with deliciousness including some cheese, ham and beans.  Generous side-vessel of salad topped with sesame seeds and other yums

Everything was top-notch, from food to service.  Definitely worth a visit, and possibly even worth the wait.    

Yelp note: if you can, head here on a weekday, when Lady Marmalade will also reward you with the option to order a breakfast poutine (unavailable on weekends).  Oh, and also: be prepared to make it rain with bills...this place is cash only."}
{"text":"I haven't written a review of Lady Marmalade? Let me change that immediately. This Leslieville brunch spot is best known for their legend-and-you-WILL-wait-for-it-dary queues for weekend brunch. I declare the long wait worth it. And if you have the luxury of going on a weekday afternoon, you will feel like a king or queen amidst the Toronto public, and feel compelled to brag. On Twitter. Like I did this afternoon.

It looks like they scored all their furniture by pointing a Time Cannon at the 70s and zapping indiscriminately. It's a collection of mismated chairs and tables between avocado green walls. With the Curtis Mayfield playing in the background, I half-expected double-digit inflation and triple-digit sideburn growth. Neither occured.

I enjoy every single thing I have had on their menu. From breakfasts, and their bennies, to their bowls and sandwiches. Today I had a bacon, brie and chicken sandwich ($15.45) and I am still thinking about it. Coupled with a cup of their soup of the day (tomato), it was a deadly combination. So good. I washed it down with a tall (really tall actually) glass of hot apple cider ($3.50) served with a cinnamon stick. 

The service here is always kind and attentive. I love this place.

Obligatory Title Pun: Voulez-vous BRUNCHER avec moi?

Menu Readability: Courier on a natural brown stock.

Need to mention: Very definitely cash only.

What this place teaches me about myself: Sometimes I will wait for brunch -- but I don't have to. #don'tbeajerkaboutit"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. I love this place!!

We went there as it was a few steps away from the Airbnb we were staying at, and upon the recommendation of the staff at Tabule where we had dinner the night before.

Cute little spot. I took the benedict eggs with cheddar, bacon and mango salsa. Absolutely stunning. The homemade hollandaise sauce was perfect. I still dream about those eggs! One negative thing: the little salad with the asian dressing that came with the eggs was... strange. Not bad in itself, but the asian dressing wasn't a good match with the flavors of the eggs. I would have preferred some fresh fruits instead.

The coffee was good. The place is cute. Food was great. Staff was friendly. If I'm staying in Leslieville again, I'll have breakfast there every morning!"}
{"text":"This is really one of my favourite brunch places. It has consistent food with simple/fresh ingredients. It's not the most inventive - it just does basic brunch extremely well. If you go on a weekend, you will be waiting at least 45 minutes if you arrive after 10am. Meanwhile, surprisingly even on weekdays, I had to wait for 30 minute on a Friday at noon. 

The menu is simple with great sandwiches - but really the top pick is usually their Egg Benny's where they have 5 choices. I've attached my pulled pork Benny as a pic, which is my favourite. Nice barbecue sauce with a light kick on the pulled pork - yolk of the Benny's is always perfectly runny. The potatoes are well-seasoned. The Asian-inspired soy dressing on the salad is so wonderful that they're selling the dressing to take home if you're interested. 

The only thing about the restaurant is that even though they do brunch super well. It is still just brunch food. I'm not sure if the food justifies a bill of over $20 after tax and tips. However, if someone wants good brunch in Toronto, I won't hesitate to offer Lady Marmalade."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my best friend.  I love the vegan option that they have which was the tofu Scramble.

It really was tasty and enjoyed it a lot.  My friend also loved her dinner.

They had some stuff that was a little overpriced like a side order of toast is $3.50 and they had juices for $12 which I cannot understand why it's high.

Other than that the food is good! :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here because of the hype from BlogTo's brunch list and Lady Marmalade made #1 on that list. But I have to say it is a little overhyped - although still a fine brunch place. 

Pro:
- Wait was not actually as long as expected. We waited 15 minutes probably and we went at 11am so not super early either. 
- Eggs Benedict had a great balance of carbs (potatoes) and healthy greens (salad). 
-Cafe mocha was delicious! 

Con:
- Not the cheapest brunch place. $15 for eggs benedict (smoked salmon) and $5 for cafe mocha so pretty standard but portion is small. 
- Far from downtown so if you were going to go it's not in the most convenient location. 
- Cash only. 

Overall I would say it's a nice place to try but nothing too special and I certainly wouldn't put it as #1 spot in Toronto."}
{"text":"Avocado green walls soothe me.  So do various types of eggs benedicts.  I took my visiting-me-from-afar mom here & she was quite pleased.  Their hollandaise sauce is wonderful & I like how warm & welcoming the staff always seems to be (even when the queue is out the door).

My only mumbling is that I wish they had a still bountiful-dairy-free smoothie option."}
{"text":"In July 2009 when Lady Marmalade first opened, they promised \"debit coming soon\" - debit is still not available as of April 2010. Cash only. Luckily there is a TD a few doors down, and if you read this before or during your wait in the guaranteed lineup, you'll have time to pop out and get some. 

Don't try to come here on weekends between the hours between 11-4pm. Seriously, unless you're an early bird, DO NOT come here on weekends or you'll end up having to go to Lady Marmalade Plan B or C - otherwise known as Barrio and Joy Bistro, and really, you came here for Lady Marmalade.

The benny with brie and avocado is the breakfast item I crave most often. The eggs are consistently perfect - expertly poached, not runny, not old, and the hollandaise is a dream. The potatoes are still not perfect, but they're on their way to being fully cooked - they're no longer raw like they were when LM first opened. Much improved, much loved, marvelously convenient!"}
{"text":"Oh god, this place was atrocious! Why is there even a line up?

My partner ordered the benny, but the hollandaise sauce was too heavy. It left a thick creamy unpleasant taste in your mouth.

The Crepe Croque Monseiur was equally bad. The poached eggs in a puddle of 'hollandaise' sauce.

As well as, the latte that came was burnt and cold. I wondered how long did they wait debating whether to serve the Latte."}
{"text":"This place is probably one of the best brunch places I've been to. My husband and I came on a Thursday at 11:30am and we had just beat the lunch rush. There is a consistent stream of people lining up but their turnaround is very quick. It is not the biggest though so wouldn't recommend for large crowds.

We ordered from the breakfast menu because we heard such great things. My husband got the huevos migos and I got the cheddar bacon mango eggs Benny. The huevos migos was very flavourful and the eggs were perfectly scrambled. The mango was a nice touch to the eggs Benny, making it both sweet and savoury. I also got a grapefruit juice which was really refreshing. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"tldr: A solid brunch spot. First come first served. Light brunch fare executed well. Cash or debit (no non-Canadian debit cards though).

Lady Marmalade is more than just a brunch spot, but I only had the brunch food. No reservations. No waitlist. Stand outside in a line. Once seated, quite cozy seating but well laid out and decorated. BLT brunch plate is substantial but still light. Potatoes are a bit spicy, but I like spicy. Ketchup has a nice tang to it. Salad is fresh and dressed nicely. Eggs are perfectly poached. Don't sway away from the basic breakfast plate as the beauty of this restaurant is it's solid execution of brunch dishes. Well done."}
{"text":"3.5/5 actually. This place always has such a long line up and takes cash only. Nothing special about their interior decor but the food is pretty good! Hit up this place at 11am on a Wednesday and waited 45 mins to be seated for 3 people - granted it was a holiday which might explain the weekday wait times. Also take note that everyone has to be there in order to be seated. It's a small place so they probably won't be able to seat more than a group of 6. 

I had the B.A.B Benny - brie, avacado, and bacon Benny with hollandaise sauce with a side of potatoes and salad. For ~$15, I'd say that's your standard brunch dish price. The benny was cooked well and I liked that they toasted the English muffin (take note other benny makers!!!) and were generous with the avacado. However, the side of potatoes threw me off... I don't think they were blanched prior to cooking which was probably why they tasted so funny. 

Still a pretty good dish though and overall dining experience so I'd probably come back again but I wouldn't be willing to wait too long in line."}
{"text":"Here on a holiday Monday so predictably the line was long - probably about an hour.   Part of the price of admission on weekends or holidays.

I had the Huevos Rancheritos which was hearty and generously portioned.  The guacamole was the highlight and was an excellent accompaniment to the eggs and beans.  I also tried a bit of the Eggs Benedict with brie and avocado; the hollandaise sauce was flavorful without being overwhelming or too heavy.  Both were near perfectly executed.  Facing the two off against each other, I'd vote for the Eggs Benedict as standing out the most clearly against a comparable option elsewhere.  

The interior has the feel of a small town diner and was relaxed.  That said, as a negative, the long snaking line outside made you feel rushed.

Overall, I'm looking forward to going back.  The menu was filled with options that would motivate returning.  The quality is exceptional and and the menu is fairly priced."}
{"text":"The air-condition was broken when there was a hear-alert... but nevertheless, the food was good."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had.  The eggs Benny with mango salsa, bacon and cheddar was so good.  Expect a bit of a wait, all great breakfast places have a wait...but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Food 5 stars - I enjoyed the Moroccan scrambled eggs. Service 1 star. Waitress not friendly and tried to rush us to leave. She asked me if I wanted my drink packed to go. I've never had that happen. Atmosphere 1 star. There's a crowd of people standing near the tables staring at you while you eat. And it's cold because the door is left open a lot and there isn't a good barrier. Also they do not take anything other than cash. Overall I felt a pretentious vibe from the staff. Would not return despite the good food. For a great experience, I'd recommend smith, Fresh or the Senator instead."}
{"text":"I finally managed to get a table at Lady Marmalade, the alleged crown jewel of the Leslieville brunch experience.

We got the last table in the house for lunch on a Friday at 2:30PM. To me this is proof to never bother trying to get in for a Sunday brunch if you're not up for a long wait. Our server was a little short with us, but with the table turn-overs they're spanked with daily, I can't blame her.

The ambiance is upscale diner, and they have a plentiful menu of creative takes on brunch and lunch classics. Next time I'll try one of their fancy-pants Eggs Benedicts. They also have a long list of \"rice bowls\" which don't really interest me.

I had the \"Crepe Croque Monsieur\" which was rich and delicious with an arugula garnish. It also came with a side of potatoes, which made it a bit too much for me. May I suggest, if you get this to sub in a side salad. My friend, Jeff C, had the club. He really seemed to enjoy it, but he's notorious for just ordering clubs, so I can't speak much to his meal. 

NB: This place is cash only, Yelpers. 

ADORABLE: They have mix and match salt and pepper shakers. Our table had lobster claws. Cute."}
{"text":"I just took some clients to Lady marmalade.

And this is a great place to have brunch.
I ate the Eggs Benny and I give it a 5 outta five. However, line up adds pretentiousness (minus .5) and they only take cash (minus .5)

Thanks to Kat's quick tip however, I noticed they only take cash (when i yelp checked in on my iphone) and went to get cash as we waited in line.


If you are deciding to eat here over somewhere else. DO IT. eat here. and enjoy it... because i said you should.

om nom nom."}
{"text":"This place is the one of the best brunch restaurants in Canada! Fantastic lunches too. My girlfriend and I go here all the time. You can't possibly be disappointed by anything on the menu here. Seriously. Go."}
{"text":"The wait in line is long but worth it. I only had the Avocado, brie cheese Benedict. Which is delicious and filling. It comes with homemade fries and salad."}
{"text":"I will preface this review by saying that I have lived most of my life in Texas and have VERY high standards when it comes to Mexican breakfast. Lady Marmalade's Migas are legit when it comes to flavour. I'm not a huge fan of brown rice - probably would have preferred the home fries - but everything else was spot on. And the hot sauce is actually hot! The boyf was underwhelmed with his benny, but he's not the one granting the stars.

We arrived at about 10:45 on a Saturday morning and had to wait about 25-30 min for a table, but it was expected so I won't complain. Our waitress was adorable and super peppy and the rest of the staff was very attentive in making sure we didn't run out of coffee - always appreciated on a Saturday morning, especially when they are busy as they are. 

Will definitely come back the next time I have a huevos craving."}
{"text":"Came here today for brunch.

I came many years ago when my cousins from California were in town before I was a true foodie and had no idea I was at such a good place (don't even remember what I ordered). WELL, everybody raves about this place and I've been meaning to go to Leslieville for a while now so today my boyfriend and I headed east!

We picked a kind of crappy day to go because there was a marathon downtown and a lot of roads were closed and buses weren't running but regardless of the roadblocks we got there and were VERY hungry.

Well there was a huge line out the door and after standing in it for a minute I was like no, can't do this, too hungry! We noticed there were a couple other brunch places next door and even went into one, got a table, read the menu and were about to order until a light bulb appeared over my head and I was all like..Okay...we came all the way here for Lady Marmalade, we have to just wait in the line and get over it (bear in mind the hostess said it would be a 45 minute wait..outside..in the cold) so we left and went back in line! My boyfriend stood in the line and I got us some Starbucks to warm us up! She wasn't kidding it really was a 45 minute wait, we kept ourselves occupied as best as we could though. I couldn't help looking in the restaurant from time to time and thinking things like \"oh my god you guys are done your meal stop talking and leave!!\" or \"why would they seat a solo bruncher at a table for 4?\" I think those were just my hangry thoughts coming out though.

Well the magical moment finally came where the door opened and it was our turn for a seat! This was way into the afternoon too haha like around 2:00, and their brunch ends at 3.

We sat there starving and decided to share the banana peanut butter milkshake to start. I felt bad because I jokingly said to my boyfriend, \"omg he's standing right there come take our order!!!\" and right after he came, hope he didn't hear me!! The milkshake was ok, but I totally could have made the exact same thing at home :P

For our mains I got the pulled pork benny and my boyfriend got the spinach cheddar waffles. I was torn between like 3 things (obviously) so I let the waiter choose as I always do! I really liked my meal and so did my boyfriend. I hear they have amazing french toast and would love to go back and try that someday but I was more in the mood for something savoury today. The benny came with home fries (not many but whatever) and a green salad with this AWESOME dressing it was some kind of asian sesame, so so so good! They also brought us over two hot sauces, one was sriracha and the other was their homemade one. I didn't have it because I'm a baby but my boyfriend tried it and it was pretty difficult for him to eat which means it's definitely very spicy because he's always complaining things aren't spicy enough!

Overall it was a success, we came, we saw, we conquered and it was worth the wait. Apparently it's always that nuts but it's just something you gotta get over because the food is so damn good.

I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"SOOOOOO gooodd! and well worth the hour wait my friends and I went through to get to our food. The pulled pork benny was delish and our server super friendly. Only thing I wish that was done differently: the stupid side potatoes, they tasted old, like cooked yesterday old, wish that wasnt the case or else I would have given the place 5 stars!"}
