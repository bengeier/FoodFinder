{"text":"I Love Pacific East Coventry.  Was so excited to see this quick casual version open even closer to my home. I only tried a soup, Chicken Ginseng, so far but it was great.  Looking forward to coming back and trying more, especially the whole grilled Snapper."}
{"text":"Really Really good value for what you are getting.  My wife got the beef noodle soup and I got the Makarel, which were both very good and well priced compared to other local places.  I also got a green tea boba which was good, although I think the boba were softer than is standard.  Overall, great option for price effective asian food without driving too far from the east side.

{"text":"Healthy, good quality, delicious Japanese food at an affordable price. Love that it's not greasy and that they accommodate my detailed requests. Their build-your-own-soups are AMAZING! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love the place!! Food is delicious and tasty. Unlike other fast food resturant's food the dishes here are very fresh and cooked upon ordering . Service is very friendly and ambiance is very good. Definitely worth a stop!!"}
{"text":"Called in for pick up. Got the wasabi fish & chips and grilled pork chop dinners....good food and a great value for the çost....both dinners came with steamed rice, salad, and French fries....so much food. I could only eat half. I was pleasantly surprised and will be back. The staff was nice and friendly too!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places close to my home. Their quality and freshness is great and service is really good everyone is extremely friendly and informative. I come here quite often and refer a ton of my friends. Everything is very authentic from their soups to chicken which is awesome and I love the coconut shrimp okay I'm rambling now but you get my point this place is great!"}
{"text":"Wow, such variety and yumminess leaves me wanting more! I ordered salmon, and boy was it good! They serve the food in plates with different sections so that food doesn't mix in with the other food. Everything here is extremely fresh. The bubble tea is a guilty pleasure but came with no ice. Over all it is worth coming back."}
{"text":"I've had Pacific Grill before and it wasn't bad. This time I opted for a Ramen soup. (I will have to come back with the specific name) 
Ramen noodles, pork, hard boiled egg, bean sprouts, and spinach. The broth was sooooooo flavorful! I should have taken a picture but by the time I decided to even speak about it, my dinner was basically over! I will have this flavorful dish again in the near future.

P.S. This is my 1st time eating \"real\" ramen, so if there are other places out there with some good Ramen, let me know!"}
{"text":"Our family have been here many times. Every time we are satisfied. The owner is vey nice. We enjoy the noodles and fish."}
{"text":"I've been patiently waiting for Pacific Grill to open. I'm a huge fan of Pacific East and live within walking distance of Cedar Center. This new concept is unlike other fast casual Asian places I've seen. Outside of Katsu Ramen, all the dishes are new to me. It would be helpful to have descriptions available as the staff is still getting familiar with the ingredients. The pictures on the TV inside are helpful, but not every item is represented. 

I had the Homemade Pulled Chicken Rice and even though it was basically rice and chicken, the portion was huge (it comes in a 64oz to-go tub) and very flavorful. However, the person taking my order gave me the impression that there would be veggies in it and that wasn't true. I think that would have made it an even better dish. Still, I took half home and it made a tasty lunch the next day.

My boyfriend ordered the Chicken and Ginseng Broth Noodles and the broth I tasted was very flavorful. Not exactly on par with Superior Pho's broth, but very tasty. I would order it for myself.

Overall, this is a good addition to the area and there are quite a few items I look forward to trying."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant for a nice chill bite to eat on a Friday night. Friendly servers and reasonable prices. Really fresh food - we had the wasabi fish and chips and shrimp summer rolls. It was very tasty and their accompanying sauces were on point. Really recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Casual dining. My favorite is the spices beef noodle soup. You get a huge bowl."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled seasoned veggies and tofu and it was really delicious. The customer service was really good and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Healthy options and good prices. Had the bulgogi, chicken katsu, and grilled salmon. Perfect for when you're tired and not in the mood to cook. Taste homemade."}
{"text":"Incredibly impressed with the food here! This is the perfect place if you are looking for a fast casual meal that provides the comfort and satisfaction of a home-cooked dinner based on a traditional Asian foundation of rice or noodles, but without the unnecessary flair of fancy serving dishes. If you are looking for a restaurant where the waiter constantly makes pleasant conversation with your party, asks you how the food tastes, and asks if you need anything else, this is not that kind of place. You'll most likely receive your food in a recyclable to-go box (yay for sustainability!) unless it's a hot noodle soup, then you'll probably get a more sturdy bowl. This place is as straightforward as a food destination can be. You enter, look at the menu, order your food, pay, eat, enjoy the food (highly recommend to bring friends/family and share the plethora of choices in the menu), and then clean up and leave. I'm a practical person, so this suits my style of dinner. In terms of food quality, I'm a huge fan of how large the meat portions are for each dish that I've tried thus far (grilled beef, eel, katsu chicken). Each dish comes as a combo, so you get your balance of all the food groups - carbs (rice/noodle), protein, and veggies (salad with dressing). I Highly recommend this place for its pragmatic approach to food, and I look forward to returning here on a weekly basis and bringing more friends each time!"}
{"text":"Update: came back, had their Katsu ramen.  Yum and a good value.  Deep bone broth flavor.  Sun ramen I think.  Spicy crispy tofu.  Awesome.  Pulled chicken and rice had good rice but chicken was a bit dry.  Upgrading my review.  This place should be busier!

--------

So I'm a pretty big fan of Pacific East on Coventry.  Great Malaysian food and pretty good sushi.  So when I heard about this place, opened by the same owners, I decided to truck out from the south side to take a look.  

This place is a fast casual place- you order at the counter and they bring it to your table.  There is a large tv playing food travel videos which I thought was a nice touch.  Prices are pretty good and the place was surprisingly empty.  

We got a number of things:

Takoyaki- those tasty Japanese octopus balls.  These were good, and a reasonable price

Samusa- like a samosa.  Smaller than I expected but tasty

Shrimp summer roll - tasty, fresh.  Better than average

Spicy Tom yum soup - authentic, deep flavored broth.  Only one shrimp but it was a bigger one.  Would be nice to have some noodles in it. 

Fish chowder - meh, didn't like it.  Should have gotten something else. 

Curry chicken - excellent.  Really delicious.  Probably would have even better with coconut rice. 

Roasted Red Snapper - not cheap but very well cooked and delicious.  Would have been even better if The Kid did not claim the lemon that was meant to squirt on it. 

Cold chicken peanut seasame noodles - tasted heavy and were warm not cold.  I liked it ok, The Wife didn't. 

Beef noodle soup - it was good, not as good as The Wife's but, not bad for Cleveland.  Phusion Cafe does it better when they are on their game. 

Overall I did like this place- there were some things that fell flat.  Buuuuut I wish they would open one closer to Fairlawn so southsiders could get a taste more easily."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch to go. The guy behind the counter recommended the beef. I rarely order red meat but it seemed like a strong recommendation.  OMG - get the beef!!"}
{"text":"super delicious! all fresh.. i had never had coconut rice before and it was scrumptious :) big side salad with good greens for $4 too"}
{"text":"This a fantastic, slightly less crowded \"branch off\" spot by the Pacific East owners. The menu is simple, but consistently good and the portions are large (enough for two meals). The workers could not be nicer and were happy to point me towards some options when I was feeling indecisive. Compared to Pacific East, Pacific Grill has more of the Asian comfort food I grew up with, making it a go-to spot for quick Chinese!"}
{"text":"Not typical \"Chinese food\" but a diverse menu of Japanese, Malaysian and Burmese dishes. Food is made to order, tastes scrumptious! I recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Pacific Delicious!

Simple, quality dishes that are spiced perfectly. Like their Asiatown brethren, the dishes I've tried at Pacific Grill use minimal sauces and spices and let quality, fresh, and perfectly grilled meats, poultry, fish and vegetables headline each dish. No heavy sauces hide or overpower the food. 

Many of their dishes are complimented with a classic side salad and perfectly steamed rice, or better, a mix of brown rice/barley/quinoa. Especially enjoyable is the Grilled Veggie plate, adorned with grilled corn, asparagus, bell & red peppers, Chinese eggplant, zucchini and tofu. Seafood Grill is also delicious. 

This is not a classic Chinese takeout restaurant. It is an array of Malay, Burmese, Japanese and other Asian cuisine. Don't be fooled by the exterior or ordering from the counter, the food is cooked/grilled fresh for you so adjust your expectations and expect to wait a few minutes. Quality, fresh food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Wanted a change of pace last night for diner and saw this place on yelp. The marinated steak was great. I'll be going back for the interesting menu. Staff was very personable."}
{"text":"Five stars for the E12 sauteed beef with unions. Haven't really tried much else other than the spicy beef soup. That was good too."}
{"text":"We are huge fans of Pacific East (both locations), this was my first time at Pacific Grill, and definitely not my last!  I went here on a Friday evening, there was a steady stream of customers.  I ordered the Shitake Mushroom soup, which is the soup that I LOVE at Pacific East.  I also ordered the grilled pork combo w/brown rice.  There was a bit of a wait, but the food arrived hot, fresh and delicious.  The soup was fairly similar to what I order at Pacific East, except the portion was more generous and there were more charred onions and mushrooms, which made it even more tasty.  The only thing missing was the lemon wedge.  The entrée included simple salad with ginger dressing.  The brown rice was $1.00 upcharge, but totally worth it.  The rice was wide grain with quinoa mixed in, and the portion was more than generous.  Last but not least, the pork was grilled perfectly, seasoned nicely and the portion was huge.   All in all, this was a great meal.  I can't wait to return to try some of the other menu offerings."}
{"text":"Ordered two ramen to go and asked specifically for no meat in both. When I got home they were both swimming in pork. So disappointed. Unfortunately I'd tried it before I noticed the pork (which made me even more upset) and it wasn't good. Tasted like salty water with some spinach and unwanted pork. I understand that dietary issues can be a hassle and down right annoying sometimes but when you simply ask for no meat it shouldn't be so hard. Who knows if it was the kitchen or the front desk who messed up, all I know is that I wasted money on something I couldn't even eat."}
{"text":"Came here for sit down dinner with my boyfriend during a weekday night. Outside of a couple at a different table & some to go orders, the place was pretty empty. 

My boyfriend ordered their Katsu ramen. I ordered the chicken katsu. Both of ordered green tea milk tea & the shichimi fries. 

Katsu ramen: 
-came out in soggy KFC style bucket
-some of the noodles were undercooked and according to my boyfriend \"harder than copper wire\" and some were over cooked and very mushy
-there was an over cooked hard boiled egg in there (most ramen places do soft boiled, but seeing that this isn't an authentic Japanese restaurant, it's not expected...but...)
-the egg was so \"hard boiled\" the yolk part spun out of it like it was its own separate entity
-the bamboo shoots were also overly tough
-there was one piece of meat in the entire bowl
-90% of the bowl was vegetables

Chicken katsu: 
-instead of being given the typical sweet Katsu sauce, i got a small container of very thick peanut sauce (it was ok)
-the katsu was very dry and bland without slathering it in sauce
-the bright side was they give 2 very large pieces of katsu

Shichimi fries: 
-very long thick potato fries that are the length of a person's hand
-they were covered in batter and fried shortly. Despite being seasoned with furikake, it only tasted of dough

Green tea milk tea: 
-boyfriend's tea: the boba was undercooked and still hard
-my tea: the boba was over cooked and barely held a physical form. literally melted in your mouth. gross. 
-the overall tea just tasted like they added a pinch of artificial powder into some hot water with a tsp of milk

The entire order was around $30. Definitely not worth it for that price."}
{"text":"So I came back... this time I brought the whole family with me. Last time, I tried the Katsu Ramen (soup), which I enjoyed. This time I wanted to try some of their rice dishes and other entrees, so we ordered:

For the kids - the Chicken Katsu entree (E-11). It came with a salad, rice and slices of chicken breast fillet, breaded and fried, with katsu sauce for dipping. A very simple meal that I think just about anyone could enjoy. 

Home made pulled chicken and rice (R-3). For the kids again... it came in a big bowl, flavored rice topped with lots of shredded chicken. Quick, easy and good!

Grilled sliced beef entree (E-2). Came with a salad, rice and slices of grilled beef over a bed of lettuce. Very tender and flavorful. Like the Chicken katsu, another very simple meal that can be enjoyed by just about anyone. I also had a bowl of their spicy tom yum soup (C-2), a soup that I'm a huge fan of. I liked theirs, but it's just not prepared the way I'm used to. I'm used to the broth being more clear-ish and with lots of mushrooms and shrimp... theirs was cloudy with no mushrooms and little shrimp. Still not bad, but not sure I'd get it again.

Chicken & Coconut gravy noodles (N-2). Came in a big bowl, big portion. My wife had this. She said it was just \"okay\". Didn't really find a whole lot of flavor, not much chicken, and the noodles seemed like your regular egg noodles you'd get from any standard grocery store.

Finally, my parents got the Grilled seafood mix (E-9). It came with salad, rice, salmon, shrimp and an oyster. I tried some of it... and I've decided I know what I'm getting next time. This dish was da bomb! Shrimp perfectly seasoned and grilled - not overcooked!

The minor issue we all had with this visit was that our rice seemed a bit old - maybe had been sitting there all day. Parts of it were hard. 

ALSO... on my first visit, and on their menu the rice bowls came with a salad, and the noodle bowls came with a side of onion rings or shredded taro or split pea fritters. On this visit, they no longer offered them and crossed them off their menus. Not sure what happened here.

Overall, a very good visit to discover many items on their menu. I think we'll be regulars here..."}
{"text":"Had teriyaki salmon and curry chicken with coconut rice from here on two separate occasions. Both were excellent! The cashier lady is super friendly and helpful as well!!! Overall it's well done!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, and it is the sister restaurant of one of my faves in the area, but I'm a sad to say that the quality and quality control has gone downhill a bit. I actually came here twice in the last week bc I was in the area and both times I ordered one of my usuals, as well as some other things. The first time, my soup was way too salty. The second time was too weak and watery, and they only gave me a half portion! (I typically do takeout.). Both times they did not have the noodle option I wanted, which made my toddler literally cry. I wish that they had told me they ran out when I was placing the order instead of when I was picking the order up and had already promised my son that particular noodle he likes."}
{"text":"I'm on a diet and I am conscious of what im eating. Pacific Grill had perfect sized healthy spring rolls that came with peanut sauce for only $2! It was very fresh and just enough to fill me up. The restaurant is really nice inside. Very spacious with lots of tables. I like that they have pictures  of all the food items they serve right on the wall. I would like to try another dish the next time im in the area."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Asian eateries. The menu is very unique - a Southeast Asian restaurant that isn't your typical Thai or Chinese. I believe the owners are Burmese or Laotian, and they also own Pacific East in Coventry.

What I like about it:
Food is prepared fresh and flavors are authentic. 
Pictures of the food on the menu are on the walls.
Serving sizes for entrees are generous.
Asians come eat here.
It has wifi and plays yummy cooking videos on its TV.
Staff is super friendly.

FYI: Pacific Grill looks like a quick serve place, but really, it's a normal restaurant, so expect to wait 15-20 minutes for your food. The prices reflect that it's not a quick serve place either. If you're looking for a place to take out lunch or dinner (and it's great for that), I recommend you call ahead and just pick up.

You should definitely check it out. Some of my favs: grilled seafood mix, fragrant chicken and tomato noodles, grilled ginger chicken, and the laksa soup."}
{"text":"The owners of the renowned Pacific East sushi restaurant (Coventry Rd) have done it again. Like Pacific East, Pacific Grill has a diverse and interesting menu, excellent flavors, and top-notch ingredients, all at a reasonable price. If you're disenchanted with typical American-Asian fare (such as Chinese carry-out) or simply in the mood for Japanese and Thai-style food, definitely give this a try.

Don't just think of this as carry-out, however. The interior is well-decorated and spacious, not to mention very quiet. I have yet to see more than a few people eating in the venue itself."}
{"text":"I really like this spot. It has a little bit of everything when it comes to Asian cuisine. It's always very clean not that a restaurant should be anything other, buuuut we all had bad Asian restaurant experiences. 

My favorite is the Tom yum soup, it taste just like I had in Thailand.

Second favorite is the coconut shrimp, take everything you know about coconut shrimp and put it out your mind. This dish is definitely different then average and is soooo good. 

Third is the crispy tofu cucumber salad. I can't explain it but it's good.

FYI I order all three everytime lol"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. I dine at Pacific East at least twice a month. I was so excited to see this  takeout/spin off of Pacific East (if that makes sense lol). However, once I looked at the menu I was scared. The lady who worked was really nice and helped me pick something simple. I ordered a teriyaki salmon and the pulled chicken. Lots of food per order with plenty of leftovers. I subbed my salad for grilled veggies and they were amazing.

My family didn't like it much but I think the best thing is to mix and match things. I took the coconut rice that came with my pulled chicken, put my teriyaki salmon and grilled on top and topped it with their house made yum yum sauce once I got home. I'll be a regular here!"}
{"text":"This is a casual pacific east off shoot that has ample free parking!  They have a few soups, salads, rice bowls and apps.  I enjoyed the coconut curry chicken soup.  Resembled the malaysian soup Laksa in flavor but ingredients were simpler but broth maybe even more flavorful. The 9$ bowl is easily two servings.  If you ask they can replace the protein to tofu instead of chicken.  They chicken tomato soup was also flavorful but was more a clear broth with vermicelli compared to coconut thick broth and egg noodles for the coconut curry soup.  The restaurant is new so food preparation takes a little time but hopefully over the next weeks it will be able to adjust.  I want to try the salmon teriyaki time.  The location is conveniently located in cedar center near cedar warrensville intersection and they are some nice dessert places to visit after a savory meal."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this restaurant after a trip to pet store next door and it was surprising good. The grilled food lives up to expectations of how actually grilled food should taste, and it's not just in the name. The grilled pork and grilled fish dishes were both very tasty. The \"homemade pulled chicken rice\" was a hit with my girlfriend who is picky when it comes to authentic Chinese food. She said, \"how the rice is cooked is what makes this dish.\" They cooked the rice correctly for this specific dish."}
{"text":"I stopped here literally 20 mins before the were about to close and they so willing to serve me with no problem! I asked what was good and the lady suggested the hibachi shrimp, and I'm glad she did because once I got home and started to eat I was instantly impressed!! I will be dining in one of these days and trying something else on the menu!!"}
{"text":"first of all I've had amazing ramen experiences in my life , and I mean amazing . this sadly was not one of them.we ordered and took it to go had a meeting to get back to and my broth was stone cold we were in the car less than 5 mins back to the office. the boy chow was over cooked. the noodle ugh were bad. the only thing that was good was my tea. smh"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, I have read some of the reviews and was so excited to try this place out. We ordered our food ahead of time and upon picking it up 30mins after ordering it still wasn't ready. On top of that I was given someone else's food in which we ended up swapping when realizing it. Initially when I opened the container everything looked great but then under three huge veggies were veggies swimming in a pool full of oil. It was unbearable to eat! The tofu was hard, and tasteless. I am very disappointed from the outcome of the meal. Luckily my job had ordered food and was able to feed me a lunch instead of having me eat oil for lunch. This place might look healthy but I can guarantee you those practices of soaking food in oil is not healthy."}
{"text":"A wonderful complementary sister spot to legendary Pacific East in Coventry. Hibachi, rich noodle bowls, savory soups, salads and seafood and bubble tea- not to mention fun desserts."}
{"text":"2/6/16*Just stopped in this new restaurant. My husband had the grilled whole red snapper with the beef tomato & basil rice w/mango smoothie and I had the grilled sliced beef with the coconut rice w/ pineapple smoothie. Both our meals were excellent! We will definitely frequent this place. Staff was helpful and knowledgeable about the food. Quick made to order cuisine. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"I love the food here! I have tried everything from the noodle dishes to the soup. My favorite is the curry chicken,  delicious. I'm also a fan of the chicken coconut soup and the coconut rice.  The ginger salad dressing is also scrumptious! Tge pacer is always immaculate and the staff is very pleasant and accommodating."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I come in here about once a week. I can't believe it's never busy when we go. I hope dinner time they get a rush because lunch is usually quiet. Once a week we had been coming for the Chicken Katsu, but they recently changed their menu offering more options. The Chicken Katsu is still on the menu, but they offer some Ramen and Soup that is very good! This is not a fancy dining experience. You walk up to the counter to pay and get a drink and they bring the food to your table. It's not fancy, but it isn't very cheap either. With a drink you are looking at around $12 - $13 per person, but the portion sizes are big. If you aren't a big eater this may get you a meal and a snack."}
{"text":"This is a must try! I eat here about once a week and always get the pulled chicken rice bowl. I consider this my comfort food because it's warm and easy on the stomach. All of my roommates get the pulled chicken as well. We tried the fried fish and chips and my friend claimed it may have been the best fish and chips he's ever had. The Wasabi dip was spot on."}
{"text":"This place is great. Their cold sesame noodles are fresh and exactly what they should be, the perfect hint of spice, the best taste and fresh cucumber and peanuts and egg on top.  

The staff is helpful and friendly... My only minor criticism is that they charged the same price for the dish without chicken; However, to be fair, I didn't argue because the staff was so nice!"}
{"text":"Love the fish,and chips !
WHO KNEW ??!!

Such a,selection 
Spme of the items on the web site are possibly not up to date,or may not be available,but there are plenty of items to experiment with."}
{"text":"This is a recently opened restaurant started by the owners of Pacific East. However, the menu is significantly different, and Pacific Grill serves a lot of Burmese food in addition to Japanese and Malaysian. I had the Fish Chowder Noodles, the Beef Tomato Basil Rice, and the Curry Chicken. The owner made it clear that the curry chicken was not Japanese or Chinese, but Burmese style. The curry chicken was very good, and was served with some delicious basmati rice. We also got some free samples of the fried split pea and one of their salads - both were also very good. Pacific Grill also sells bubble tea, but I didn't try their bubble tea this time. I really like Pacific Grill because good Burmese food is very hard to find. I plan on bringing one of my Burmese friends in the future to try it, to see what her thoughts are. I also plan on bringing some of my other food loving friends here because it's definitely a very unique culinary experience that you can't find elsewhere in northeast Ohio."}
{"text":"I... didn't really know what to make of this place, but I think I have gotten it figured out.  When you first walk in and take a look at the menu, it looks like they have a strange mishmash of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Malay and Thai rice and noodle bowls.  However, this restaurant, like its sister restaurant Pacific East, is owned by Chinese people.  So, this restaurant basically serves a mishmash of Asian rice bowls with a Chinese twist.

Imagine Japanese ramen, Japanese katsu, Korean ginger chicken, but cooked in a Chinese style by Chinese people.  They were good, but just not exactly what we were expecting."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, food and service here is fantastic.  We had chicken hibachi and grilled beef with rice, and a mochi.

Every item was very fresh, including the vegetables, and it was not greasy/oily.  The service was quick.  The staff was courteous.  They even have yum-yum sauce!  

The dining room has a nice aesthetic; it's calm inside with nice lighting.  No fluorescent lighting or goofy stuff.  It's also quiet.  

We are very pleased and will be making this a frequent dining spot."}
{"text":"Second time dining here. The middle soup is great. I ordered mixed grill. All cooked to perfection except shrimp is overcooked. The spicy tofu salad is too spicy. Fast like sambal olek hot sauce mixed with sweet chili sauce. I will ask for sauce on side next time. Just too much sauce for salad. Shrimp summer roll is very fresh. Just an overall comfort food for me."}
{"text":"The food is okay for the proces, but honestly, I mainly come here to get smoothies at 10pm lol. Dont judge me ;@p"}
{"text":"So this is the only place in the great Cleveland (that I know of) that offers authentic Burmese dishes. There are many options on the menu so it may be a bit daunting when choosing your meal. For starters, I recommend the pea fritters, which remind me a bit of Indian samosas. The tea leaf salad has nice lemony dressing mixed with peanuts and pickled tea leaves. Sounds like an odd combination but it seriously goes well together. The tom yum soup is like no other I've had in Cleveland-just the right amount of kick and flavor. It paired perfectly with my grilled pork chop which was nicely seasoned and incredibly tender. Also I recommend the chicken and ginseng noodles which has nice clean broth containing peppery homemade meatballs. All in all, I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try. I passed it multiple times in the plaza and I wasn't disappointed. I got the coconut shrimp and I can  see myself craving it all the time...nice size and crispy!!"}
{"text":"Tried it out of the blue, and I'm really glad I did. The service was great and the food came pretty fast. Best of all, the food was great. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"For people who like Burmese food, or if you've never had Burmese food before; this place is amazing. The food is fresh, and it tastes like a little piece of Burma. 

If you're looking for an authentic Asian meal (unlike Panda Express), you must come here! 5 out of 5!"}
{"text":"Had a good first takeout experience from Pacific Grill! 

My wife got the teriyaki salmon plate, which came with a generous portion of perfectly cooked salmon filet, served with white rice and a small salad. At $8.95, a great deal for fresh fish -- would definitely order again. I also randomly chose the \"curry chicken rice with cashew and raisin,\" which reminded me of a Malaysian dish called Nasi Goreng (fried rice with a side of curry chicken). I really liked the chicken -- very tender, well spiced, and flavorful. The fried rice was tasty if a bit dry -- I wondered if it was cooked to order. 

We also got the shichimi fries ($3.50) and the tea leaf salad. The fries are basically long potato wedges with a light Japanese pepper seasoning. Really nice! They could be crispier, but I'd still probably order them again because I'm a sucker for wedgies. I was really excited about the tea leaf salad because I haven't had Burmese food since leaving San Francisco. If you haven't had it, I recommend trying it -- a nice mix of textures and flavors. 

Not a big deal, but I did see a few other diners standing around and squinting at the menu with confused looks on their faces. Like its cousin Pacific East, Pacific Grill offers a funny mix of Southeast Asian (mainly Malaysian) and Japanese dishes -- two really dissimilar cuisines/cultures. But instead of putting them on different menus, Pacific Grill just lumps them all together, sometimes with awkwardly translated or barely descriptive names like \"Yummy Yum Rice.\" I'm guessing they may have to redo the menus after they get tired of answering questions.

Overall, really happy to have this in the neighborhood! We'll be back for the reasonably authentic food and big portions -- looking forward to trying the katsu entrees."}
{"text":"Very spacious diner-like Asian fusion restaurant in a big plaza with other eateries like Five Guys, Panera, Chipotle, etc. Here, you order and pay first, then they'll bring you your food (all in disposable paperware). 

There's a variety of dishes, including rice entrees and noodle options. We tried the katsu ramen and sautéed sliced beef with onions. Ramen noodles were too soft, but the portion size was decent (it came with quite a few pieces of meat). The soup and flavoring were kind of bland and didn't taste like much. The sautéed beef with onion is a rice dish, which also came with a side of salad. This one was pretty good. The beef and onions were well cooked and sweet. The portion size here was also pretty large as we took home half the beef with rice. Came a second time and tried the grilled pork chop (pretty good too!) and the fragrant chicken & tomato soup with noodles. I still prefer their rice dishes to their noodle dishes, but the tomato one was definitely better than the ramen.

Boba milk tea drinks were so-so. Definitely doesn't compare to the ones we have in CA for the price of $3.75 each, but the taro flavor was pretty on point. Thai tea flavor was not so great. Another complaint is that the drink was like 1/3 ice (even though I asked for less ice) so it was difficult to get to all the boba. 

Big plaza, lots of parking. But also lots of other choices. Not a bad place if you're craving Asian food, and seems like lots of people come by for takeout."}
{"text":"Not a bad option for ramen and other Southeast Asian foods in the Heights. I ordered the spicy beef noodles, but asked them to add an egg, which they were more than happy to oblige. While I was expecting a VERY spicy broth, in reality, it was more like a medium (excellent, because I enjoy actually being able to taste my food). The broth was complex and delicious! Both the beef and baby bok choy were perfectly tender, as well. There is no way that I could have finished this amount of noodles in one sitting, though, so got a container for the rest to take home. 

My husband got the chicken sesame noodles, which were served cold. The chunks of cucumber in that dish offset the creamy sesame sauce nicely. My kid ordered the teriyaki salmon dish, which he reported to be \"the best salmon I've ever eaten\". 

At $9 each, all three of these dishes were way more than just a good value. This is going to become a regular stop for my family, for sure!

*Here is one thing they have in person that isn't in their online menu- a serve yourself mochi bar! We chose a handful different flavors to bring home for later when we weren't so stuffed, and they were delicious. Soft mochi outside, with the perfect amount of ice cream in the middle. I could visit Pacific Grill every day for those alone."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Great value and great flavors. Super consistent quality."}
{"text":"First time. 

Wasn't impressed. Had the salmon. Didn't finish it. Had no flavor even with the teriyaki sauce. 

Will I return: prob not."}
{"text":"Save yourself the time and money.  Slow service.  Sad decor. And undercooked, under seasoned fare that comes in over sized paper cups with teeny little spoons and chopsticks. The worst part: \"Katsu ramen\" pictured as dry noodles and meat that came as dishwater flavor soup and the insistence (twice) that I got what I ordered. And wasabi fish that has never even been near wasabi. Sad. Just sad."}
{"text":"Fish chowder is one of the best. Made of real fish not msg. Ramen noodle salad is my second favorite. Probably the only place in Cleveland for real Burmese food and authentic Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"I've been to pacific grill ever since they have opened and at first it was great. 

Lately I ordered my usual order the grill beef and a random soup and small bites, but the grill beef didn't taste the same as it usually is. 

I'm would usually give a 4/5 stars since I really like this place, not perfect but still good and come back.

Now I am giving only 3/5 since most of the food doesn't taste the same anymore, still would come back but not as frequent."}
