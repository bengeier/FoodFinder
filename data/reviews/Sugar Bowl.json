{"text":"Good ice-cream poor service.  That pretty much sums it up. 

The people serving up lack eye contact, engagement and are there to do their thing and get the hell out.  

Oh well. 2 bucks a cone.  Whatever!"}
{"text":"The charm and decor of an old time ice cream  parlor with the horrible service of the present day.
The silverwear was dirty and my ice cream was used with a dirty scooper, while else would cookies and cream have hints of praline flavor?
Nevertheless, ice cream is ice cream and who doesn't love that?"}
{"text":"Went there twice this past weekend and was met both times with absolutely unsurpassed service and sundaes.  

They bring you water as soon as you sit down, which I appreciate as it always helps me make more clear headed menu choices.  And no matter what I chose off the menu I wasn't disappointed.

Anything you want ice cream wise, they will deliver!  No request is completely out of bounds, and each server I had was extremely friendly, they made me feel so comfortable.  I want to come back to Phoenix just for another sundae."}
{"text":"This place is too cute. All the pink, the Family Circus comics, and the throwback to the old school soda parlors makes the atmosphere and ambiance of this place. I've been going here for a while. I remember my pre-21 nights when I would venture out with friends for a late night treat. The place, on the weekends, would be open till midnight. I love their ice cream, I will get my mint chocolate chip ice cream to go. I also really love their Top Hat and Tin Roof Sundaes."}
{"text":"Delicious!!  I come here every time I'm in town to visit family and I have never been disappointed.  It's set up like an old-time Shoppe and they went all out; the d√©cor alone makes it worth the visit.  But the ice cream!  Oh what ice cream!  I always get a different sundae and I have never regretted my choice.  It's a big bowl of sweet happiness.  I've never tried the food but it looks just as good.  If you're a fan of ice cream, this place is a MUST!"}
{"text":"superb sundaes and service. lilly took good care of us. 
my excellent wife likes the top hat sundae. 
my excellent wife's mom liked the root beer float.  a very rare compliment. 
i like the hot fudge sundae with dutch chocolate and praline ice cream."}
{"text":"Maybe it's a backlash to all the hype I've heard about this place, but I was seriously disappointed.

Yes, Sugar Bowl has old-fashioned charm. Yes, it has history. Yes, it has many Family Circus prints on its walls.

But the ice cream just isn't that good. It's not homemade; it's just Dryer's. When we went, we also got to try the caramel and the chocolate sauces.  They were almost the same thing: overwhelmingly sweet, but lacking in real flavor.

If you're in the mood for a nostalgic experience, Sugar Bowl might be for you. If you're looking for good ice cream ... keep looking."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed to find out the ice cream isn't home-made.  It was good though.

We were excited to find this out-of-place ice cream joint in the middle of Old Town.  The decor is fun for an ice cream shop, and I was thrilled to sit at the counter and order a treat.

I wish the place didn't smell so bad.  It's really off-putting... spilled, spoiled milk must be everywhere.  

But overall, its a good value for the money (you won't spend more than $5-6) and a cute place to stop in for a cool-off."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Why sit at a bar in Old Town Scottsdale when you could be sitting at the Sugar Bowl counter on a Saturday night? What? I'm a nerd? Yes, yes I am. But everything on the Sugar Bowl menu is amazingly delicious and tastes so fresh!  One scoop of their ice cream is a HUGE amount, so when I want an \"extra fancy\" ice cream dish I grab a friend or two to split it with. I had the Desireme Banana Split last night and it was great, but very large.

The whole place is covered in old fashioned pink stripe ice cream, pink booths, pink paintings, etc. The only downside is the bathroom, which is not pink, just dirty. Also, they don't give you napkins unless you ask and there aren't any on the tables, which seems kind of silly, for an ice cream joint."}
{"text":"Located in Oldtown Scottsdale amid the most art galleries/stores i've seen in a concentrated area, Sugar Bowl was a refreshing visit to relieve the 110 heat. With the decor of an old-fashioned diner and family circus artwork prominently displayed throughout, this establishment provides a friendly and welcoming atmosphere that is very family-oriented (there's an adjoining arcade area with games for the kids). 

As for the ice cream itself, I was happily satisfied with my selection: that lovely ice cream sundae with the puff pastry covered in hot fudge. There was a specific name for it, but at this time I cannot recall it. The puff pastry was a little stale or hard, perhaps because it was previously frozen....so in that respect a fresh cream puff would have sealed the deal. The hot fudge added the right amount of sweetness to the creation. Also, I was expecting the joint to make their own ice cream, but was rather unimpressed when our server mentioned they use Dreyer's ice cream. If they had made their own ice cream, the place would have earned 5 stars easily. Regardless, my sundae was great, especially on that hot day, and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for an ice cream treat. 

As for our service, our server (who was memorable because she was probably one of a handful of asians that I spotted in arizona...being asian myself, my family and i feel like we had doubled the asian population in AZ) was absolutely wonderful and even validated my selection of ice cream with a \"niice\" that made me feel like i had selected the winning lottery ticket from the variety of choices on the menu. Plus, having a great smile always helps."}
{"text":"Nice place.   This restaurant is so cute and the service was excellent.  I had a reuben sandwich which was outstanding.  I would go back again.  Everyone at my table had ice cream desert of some kind and they loved it.  I am not an ice cream person so I passed on desert.  The deserts looked so delicious too.  This was right on the corner and easy to find.  The parking is a little crowded but then this is Old Town Scottsdale.  Everyone at my table had something different to eat and it all looked so good.  There is a big menu to choose from too."}
{"text":"Home made ice cream yummy. The banana split to kill for. The environment was a good old fashion ice cream parlor. Next year will be there 60 years of celebration. I hope I can come back to see how they will celebrate. I Love all the retro furniture. A great place for a family to go and have old fashion style ice cream parlor"}
{"text":"It's very interesting on the inside with all of the pink.  Ice cream was good and cheap"}
{"text":"I ordered the egg salad on sourdough. The bread was stale and the egg salad did not taste good, way too much sweet relish and mustard. The kettle chips were the only decent thing on the plate. The service was also not good. No silverware or napkins were brought out. 

One of my dining companions was brought the wrong plate of food twice and another had to ask for the side she ordered."}
{"text":"Located in Scottsdale. Very family friendly, old school feel. Ice cream here is light tasting, but the toppings make it delicious!"}
{"text":"The  Sugar Bowl is a traditional ice cream parlor.

There's no frozen mixing station, no exotic additives, no movie merchandise tie-ins, no deep fried butter.

In service since at least the 1960s, this venerable restaurant chiefly serves ice cream.  I know they serve other food, but I'm not interested in anything but dessert when I come here.   I've been an occasional customer for years.  I come in late at night, and I order ice cream and coffee.  With a minimum of fuss, I get ice cream and coffee.  If they are out of the flavor I'm after, there are several others that make up the lack.  The place is reasonably clean (busy, but not messy), and the service is good.

Give it a try.  You'll probably like it."}
{"text":"Three stars for food, with one extra twinkly pink star for cute ambiance. When you enter it is all pink, sweet old-fashioned ice cream parlor with nostalgic ice-cream themed pictures sprinkled throughout. There is an peculiar, old, but appealing smell--no bother to me, I like smelling history. 

We had scoops of Turkish Coffee, classic vanilla and strawberry ice cream. Yes, it's Dryer's brand and not the premium homemade so common to the Midwest but still creamy and good. 

The sundaes looked like delectable old-fashioned fun. 
Families (or anyone looking for a cute old-fashioned kick) will dig this place. They serve classic sandwiches too. Counter service will serve you quickly if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"When Old Town Scottsdale heats up, folks head to the ice cream shop. Don't be fooled by the line out the door, there is plenty of seating at the back of the restaurant, where they have a basketball amusement that is noisy and annoying.

Ol' Bil Keane of Family Circus fame favors this place, which probably hasn't seen many updates since it opened in 1958. Plenty of Family Circus art on the walls and menu. Maybe the only update has been that basketball game, which I guess was an impulse buy.

Other reviewers have noticed an odor, and I experienced it too. I think that comes from a room full of sweaty people in an aged building. Or maybe it's just the germy, sticky basketballs in that game."}
{"text":"Ok so I've been to this place a handful of times and the icecream sundaes are always great!! BUT!....I've never felt like it was ever really clean!! The place \"looks\" dirty because the restrooms are old and the back room really does look like an after thought. This trip, while the ice cream was delicious THE WOMANS ROOM IN THE BACK WAS HORRENDOUS!! I don't mean just a bit dirty I mean someone exploited severely, which is very DANGEROUS for anyone let a lone little kids. I told 3 different people over the hour we were there that they need to lock it and clean it up and NO ONE DID ANYTHING!! Finally I got the manager and told him and this is something HE should've handled but he didn't even go back there he just passed it on the a teenager in his working staff. This was NOT right.  This place has slipped so far down, regardless if the ice cream is gods or not this one time great institution has sadly lost its self pride and just laying on it previous glory days. This is sad. They need a FACELIFT AND MANAGEMENT THAT CARES ENOUGH TO SEEK OUT How the place is looking and its reputation. My daughter actually took a picture that I think the Health depart should see, then go and really give that place the once over. The only reason I'm NOT posting the picture is because I'm mortified and way too embarrassed for the place!!   There is a major lack of pride, sorry to say it will be a very long time if ever we return."}
{"text":"Came here after I went to Olive and Ivy for my sons birthday.  The ice cream is really good. The place is like an old time ice cream parlor.  It is really pink too. I would suggest going here if you want some good ice cream and you are in the area."}
{"text":"I keep wanting to like this place.  I want to support a local business, and yet....

Last year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!   Excellent!), and after we placed our orders for lunch, I took out our SET game (it's a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).  WIthin moments, the server was back at our table.  \"You can't do that.\"  \"What?  Play cards?  It's not gambling.\" (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  \"The owners don't allow it.\"  \"They don't allow it?  It's a matching game.\"  \"No.  You'll have to put it away.\"

Now.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if we'd finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).   However, this was during the gap between ordering and eating.  I KNOW I should've just left then.  Instead, I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!).  

A couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.  Didn't bother with the cards this time.  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my son's bread.  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill, but eish.    

I'd kind of like the \"Restaurant Impossible\" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.  I don't mind the nostalgia stuff, but the place does need a solid going over."}
{"text":"This place really should get 5 stars but it doesn't even deserve 1.

Why?

Well for starters unless you go there when it opens it pretty dirty with napkins and bits of food on the floor and on the seats. No excuse for this.  Secondly, the bathrooms are ALWAYS disgusting.  Honestly I don't know how it passes inspection with the bathrooms alone.

It is a great location and the ice cream is pretty damn good. Nothing fancy. It's old school ice cream, and for that it's fantastic.  The non-ice cream items (burgers, sandwiches, etc) should be avoided. Just get the ice cream.

Finally, like others have said the owners (not so much the staff) are on the rude side.  I have seen customers get yelled at because they asked for their table or chair to wiped down.  Maybe over the years they have become jaded seeing the countless number of drunks coming in here and acting like they own the place.  I can tell you that when he was yelling at the customer above she was very polite and it was in the mid-afternoon. I hope that someday this place gets bought by someone who loves customers and much as many people love this place out of nostalgia. For the past several years this place has lost its sparkle and I really would like to see it return to its former glory."}
{"text":"Boyfriend got a strawberry sundae and it just a couple of sliced berries & a tiny bit of strawberry topping. I ordered a root beer float & it was a disaster.  It came w/the glass in a shallow saucer and was bubbling over (????). Ice cream was so hard that I couldn't push it down into the root beer  to even melt it. It reacted like a volcano sending root beer swamping the saucer and then the table. I had to get up & ask for napkins or a rag then my server said \"Wow that's crazy . Ummmm do you want some more root beer for it?\". No just let the ice cream warm up a tad then add root beer not the other way around. There is a gelato place across the street with better service and their stuff is delicious.  I know it's old school Scottsdale but it needs an overhaul. Stop coasting on tourists"}
{"text":"creamed walnut fudge sundae... thats all i gotta say about that!"}
{"text":"Being the first time here, we have been let down on all the raving on how great it is first... Our server was soooo rude and could care less if we where helped or not , then we asked recommend us on the top sellers, we picked \" top hat \"something ... POINTLESS! Not thing special. A piece of bread with vanilla ice cream and a OVER load of fuge . And did I forget to mention... Over price?  Once he served us our ice cream, he never bother to check on us until we asked for our check . And still had us waiting ! Never am I coming her again..."}

{"text":"I am giving the Sugar Bowl 1 star due to the fact that I brought my family from out of town to the Sugar Bowl as I do with all of our out of town guests. We arrived at 9:50 P.M. and were told by the teenager who was at the cashier station that we could only order 1 or 2 scoops to go. I said, \"We cannot sit down?\" he said, \"No, you cannot, you have to leave.\" I was completely shocked! After we left someone locked the door and another group of 3 people tried to enter the restaurant and could not because the door was locked. By this time it was 9:52. I called the Sugar Bowl when I got home and I asked for the manager. The person who answered said his name was Dan and that he was the manager. He listened to my complaint and thought that the response of the employee was odd and that he was sorry. After being a customer my entire life (40+ years), I am extremely disappointed and insulted by how we were treated by the Sugar Bowl's employee. I am sorry to say that you have lost a long time fan of your establishment."}
{"text":"Just getting home from celebrating my son's 5th b-day, a night I will never forget!! Recomended to go to this Sugar Bowl that it would be a true B-Day treat I would not expect coming home to share what a HORRIBLE experience my whole family and I went through. Something I thought would be so simple, guess not for this Sugar Bowl. Starting with a 33 min wait to be greated by a server that had the excuse of she thought we were taken care of by someone else is not exceptable. Can't u see there's no drinks on our table? Then, the food comes out and every dish is made incorrectly. Server says, she's new and wasn't sure what there food looks like. Well didn't you study the menu & have to take a test on it before getting a section? Then, after our food was remade I gotta say FYI in my opinion, you can get a way tastier patty melt at the waffle house.. The server mentioned the Manager would be over shortly with apologies & most likely fix the bill.. I am not looking for a free bee but a Manager visit would of been nice. DIDN'T HAPPEN, yet I watched him hesitate over n over to walk our tables way, yet instead of doing so I guess he just was hoping the problems occurring would just disappear as he continued to eat food right by the kitchen door. And the problems,THEY DIDN'T GO AWAY instead, got much worse. Now it's time for a Birthday Ice Cream Treat. Well, seems like the whole table gets there ice cream 1st as I watch my son's melt away and have to explain to my 5yr old way he doesn't have his. My son, the look of sadness in his eye's tore this Mother up. The server says they are fixing it up nice..as I LMFAO, b/c I can see they are just adding more whip to cover up the melty mess and sticking a candle in it.. By the time they came out to sing Happy Birthday, I was Singing in tears!! My son should not have had to watch everyone else eat ice cream and then wait longer for his while they tried to fix there mistakes. As a person whom has been in FnB for over 15 yrs, including Managment & General Managment after serving in high volume establishments, would NEVER recommend this place to go.Exspecially for a celebration. And to the Server whom never came to apoligize to us before leaving, if you can't own your mistakes and show some sympathy on behalf of the place your working at, then I highly suggest to get out of this career now, it's not ment to be. Suger Bowl, thank you for making a night to never forget. I will never forget to tell people what your place is like.."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service of ice cream. Lots of variety and fun ice cream shop atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great butter pecan ice cream! Big servings!"}
{"text":"Overpriced vittles and undertrained staff.  

A) They were out of carbonized water, so the only options left were the $5 malts or water. With no apologies.
B) The daily special (a small slab -1/6 of the 8\" pie- of quiche and a fair size helping of fruit) was $9.  
C) The wait staff was barely courteous.  We waited almost 10 minutes to place our order while I observed them counting tips, hovered around the cashier.  They put our water, food, utensils on our table without so much as a \"pardon me\".  They checked in once before asking if I was ready for my ticket.  And the table next to me had their menus open and laid out while their server put their water ::on:: their menus.  Not.Cool.
D) I wasn't hip with the almost family-style seating. We were uncomfortably close to our stranger-neighbors.  So much so that I could too easily hear their conversations.  Oy!
E) The manager? older gentleman wandering around had a stained shirt on.  What?  Wear an apron dude.

If you're in Scottsdale for a visit - find a place where your $25 will get you more than a half-full tummy."}

Next time I'm going back, I'm shooting for a shake or ice cream soda.

There is also regular food served here (salads, burgers, sandwiches), but I've yet to try that.

The service has been a bit slow getting your treat, water and check from my experience.

{"text":"Walking in The Sugar Bowl recently there was a noticeable smell of dirty-rag-on-plastic, pink plastic that is. The waiter was pleasant. The food did not take long at all to arrive. We both ordered the tuna salad and the presentation was nothing to write about really. The lettuce was fresh and cold and so we're the tomatoes. The tuna salad was mediocre. 
The situation of the restroom: The Sugar Bowl was established in 1958. I think the wallpaper goes back to that period and is downright dirty. The rug in the restaurant and \"playroom\" is in the same state. Old, dirty and it looks smelly. This place must have had its glory time, but that has long gone now. It needs an update in all aspects. 
Don't think I will go back. There are many more options in that area to spend my time and money."}
{"text":"This place is strictly a dessert place.  While they serve food, I would skip the food and go right to the dessert.  At least that is what I do, being that I have only eaten dessert at this place.

I have been here 3 times, all of which have been very good.  My only complaint is that the sundae's are a little pricey and the decor is pretty dated.  But it is an authentic retro, ice cream parlor.

The sundaes are always made up to perfection.  They have many unique flavors and I have enjoyed each one.  

Next time you are in need for a sugar fix, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I'd definitely return for the ice cream, food was not awesome...but what makes it great is the small arcade in the attached room.  Perfect for my 2 and 4 year old to play fun games and no worries of them escaping or being trampled by older kids like at Peter Piper Pizza.  We'll be back!  Great way to spend a Sunday afternoon in old town with little kids!"}
{"text":"Sugar Bowl Sundays was a tradition my best friend and I implemented after we both went through bad break ups last year. We spent Sundays at the retro downtown Scottsdale ice cream parlor where we drowned our sorrows in hot fudge sundaes or chocolate malts for a month. It was a good way to forget our sadness, have fun and lose ourselves in this weekly tradition where we would catch up on the week's events.  Plus, it was better than doing a a few Jaeger Bombs and ultimately crying and/or making out with a random stranger later.

While we don't need the therapy of Sugar Bowl Sundays any longer, it's still fun to pop in from time to time and splurge. I think everyone should treat themselves to a Sugar Bowl Sunday every now and then.

{"text":"After a fiasco at dinner, we walked over to the Sugar Bowl for some dessert since sugar makes everything better.

Love the old school look and feel to this ice cream parlor - you feel as if this place was frozen in time. Get it? :)

Choose from a large selection of ice cream scoops, build your own sundae or get a shake, soda or float - tons to choose from! The mint chocolate ice cream is great - large chunks of bittersweet chocolate. Next time I'd love to try the sorbets. 

They also serve soups and sandwiches for those wanting something savory before enjoying dessert.

What is neat about this place is that there is a small game room in the back with air hockey, basketball hoop game, skeeball, etc. 

One gripe: We had fun playing a ton of games with our young cousin and thought it would be fun to redeem our tickets for one of the \"prizes\" in the cases. No staff was in the game room, and there is a note clearly stating to go out front for service. We tracked someone down and after waiting for 20 minutes or so, no one ever came back to help us. It was not busy at the ice cream shop, so not sure what the delay was. 

Overall a tasty, fun experience when in Old Town!"}
{"text":"Was a fun place to try.  Felt like what I imagine it'd be like to step into a 50's malt shop.  The pink decor was fun and carried through to the napkins.  The servings were huge and the ice cream good.  I didn't care for the brownie in my sundae, but the hot fudge made up for it.  My friend had the top hat and I tried q bite and liked it better.  Felt like a tourist destination but was fun all the same.  Would be fun for a date or girls night out."}
{"text":"The food was fair. We ordered sandwiches and the cheese was processed cheese. The ice cream was tasty but not great. It's a fun place to take kids for a nostalgic experience. Our service was good too."}

Super cute place to take the kids for a nice, cold, yummy treat!   Would recommend to anyone wanting an ice cream treat in Old Town!"}
{"text":"Oooh the chocolate malt! So good. So so so good. No longer comes with whipped cream (so weird, and I even asked if that was normal) or the extra is the cup on the side. 

Great hot fudge sundae. 

Food is okay. Double Burger (for $12), hot dog, both okay. Not good, not great, just okay. 

Bathrooms were just gross. Paper towels overflowing, general bathroom uncleanliness and there was a layer of dust in the family restroom that doesn't accumulate in one day. (We were there around noon.)

Not the sugar bowl of yesteryear. But the ice cream treats sure are tasty."}
{"text":"Good ice cream, decent burger...games, cartoons on the wall made specifically for this place, right on the corner in Old Town...great place for families and kids."}

I was pleasantly surprised by how extensive the menu was with the offerings of salads, burgers, soups, in addition to the expected sweet treats. The place has a very old-time feel and friendly staff. The ice cream and food were good, nothing amazing, but it was nice to be able to eat while the kiddos played in the arcade area. The staff were very kind and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Great oldtimey ice cream shop in Old Town Scottsdale. Banana split was the real deal."}

{"text":"Used to live in the tri-city area and going to the Sugar Bowl was a mandatory stop for my Saturday outings with my mom.  Since moving away, I have only been back to Arizona sporadically.  This time, I made a special trip to Sugar Bowl with the kids.  The decor was the same (except the addition of a game room off to the side) and the menu was the same.  The simple menu of sandwiches provided a range of choice - the tuna melt served with chips was tasty.  The ice cream treats were good.  The kids had root beer floats and I had a top hat sundae (a big profiterole with lots of hot fudge on top).  The ice cream is not ultra rich - just regular stuff.  Service was friendly and fast.  All in, I would say that the experience probably rated a 3 star but the 4th star is because it did not disappoint my memories."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a snack because my wife had read about it in a magazine and remember it from the Family Circus comic. We sat at the counter. Service was a little slow to take our order. Once ordered, the ice cream came fairly quickly. We each got sundaes. They were ok, it was ice cream, nothing special and they only gave me half a cherry on my sundae."}
{"text":"It was meh - for all the hype I was expecting more. Parking is a bit tough and though there were 8 of us and the service was great I think most of us felt is was just \"ok\"."}
{"text":"When I was a little kid, a trip to Sugar Bowl was a huge treat!  I revisited recently, and as an adult I have to admit I was a little heartbroken.  The ice cream is still delicious, but the store is dumpier than I remember.  Where I remembered a whimsical pink decor, everything just seems a little dirty now and less romantic.  I have no complaints about the food, but overall it just did not seem worth the drive to Old Town, the parking hassles, and the price.  Probably won't go back."}

We had found the place while on our way to dinner a few days before.   Anyways, the deserts we had were amazing.  I really liked the brownie ice cream, despite the fact that they had ran out of whip cream.  While there weren't a lot of dishes that didn't have some sort of nuts on it, I and my family were certainly were satisfied with the choices that we made.  Wished we could have ordered some fries afterwards though.  Definitely will go again when in town."}
{"text":"The decor is fun, but the ice cream was just what you could order anywhere else, and the place was filthy.  Yes, the place was busy, but they were only making a half-hearted attempt to clean between customers.  It was hard to enjoy my ice cream because I was grossed out by the nasty floor under our table. I was also shocked that nuts were an extra charge on the sundaes."}
{"text":"A real, classic fountain! We ordered a pinnacle peak sundae and sat at the counter... Excellent service and so many classic sundaes to choose from. Since 1958 Sugar Bowl has not changed their image so everything is authentic from the pink floor to the pink bar stools. A must while in Old Town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We had the gosh awful gooey banana split, and pinnacle peak hot fudge sundae. Both were superb! I love this place!"}
{"text":"This Place had extremely fast Service even on Saturday! I had an Oreo Shake and my friend had a root beer float abd they were both excellent. I definently would suggest coming here. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My ranking is totally based on ice cream.   I mean, it is ice cream in the middle of the freakin desert.   How can you not give five stars!!!!

Cute little stop after visiting all the ridiculously high priced stores in old Scottsdale."}
{"text":"One of my favorite stops in Old Town Scottsdale, an old fashion ice cream shop with great milk shakes!"}
{"text":"Good value. Mighty fine old school ice-cream"}
{"text":"We tried this place because a few people said it exuded nostalgia and was very good. It did exude nostalgia if you grew up going to depressing, run down, badly lit diners. The interior of this place was quite depressing and sometimes when Im happy and I think of this place I get a little depressed. Im giving it two stars because the ice cream sundae was pretty good and the service was quick and nice. Overall I give it a \"Mmm ice cream is worth the depression, I guess!\""}
{"text":"Okay, so where on Earth do they find their drinking water?  Quite possibly the most disgusting water ever. I actually think they are treating their water with chlorine before serving. The owners should be ashamed. 

The ice cream is good as expected. Shakes are yummy. Go here for desert.  Four stars for the deserts. 

The food is just alright. Nothing special.  2.5 stars for the food. 

Given the water they are serving I rate this place as a \"pass.\"  They are living on their reputation from a time long gone."}
{"text":"Delicious desserts!  I've never eaten anything but the ice cream desserts but it's a nice treat on a hot Summer day.  The vintage decor is really fun and interesting to view while you wait also.  The wait staff has always been friendly and the place always seems pretty busy.  My boyfriend has been going here since it has opened and we will continue to do so. The pricing isn't too bad either."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times.  The ice cream is ordinary.. whipped cream from a can.  Wouldn't give it a second thought if it wasn't located in the heart of Old Town.  But you know, when you your hours say your open to 10:00 PM you should be open until 10:00 PM."}
{"text":"Very antique old fashioned ice cream parlor in the Old Town of Scottsdale. The interior decor is mostly of the color pink. A sit-down environment where you don't get to select or do taste test like typical coldstone/baskin.

Flavors weren't too extensive. Maybe 12 at most. However they do special flavors like pumpkin for october now. 

Was recommended their \"top hat sundae\". This sundae is simply large cream puff pastry with a scoop of ice cream in between and a spoonful drizzle of chocolate fudge syrup.

I subbed the vanilla ice cream to strawberry but was still a disappointment. Was nothing amazing and definitely wasn't blown away. Puff pastry was stale and tasted like it has been in the fridge for some time. Ice cream tasted like ones you can get at the markets and fudge was nothing authentic.

A nice place for that vintage ambience on a late night stroll out in Old town but definitely can't trigger my cravings.

Plentiful free parking. $5 for a sundae"}
{"text":"We came for ice cream and 'assumed' it was homemade, it was not and tasted like supermarket rocky road out of a cardboard container. Did not try the food and probably will not. Paying is a chore and usually a long line (unsure why)"}
{"text":"Eeeek, an diner-esque ice cream parlour! 

Living out our dream of being on the set of Grease, we seated ourselves into a pink booth contemplating what we'd be having for a late night treat.

We didn't leave much room for dessert from dinner (we thought a couple laps around the block would help lol), we shared the Sugar Bowl Treat banana split.  This was the perfect size since it worked out to be a scoop of ice cream each (one vanilla, one chocolate) drizzled in pineapple and strawberry and whipped cream.

It was fun to see the same excitement come from both young and old as their ice cream creations came to their tables. Who doesn't light up when they get to have ice cream?

Sugar Bowl is a spot you need to pop into the next time you're in Old Town, whether it be an afternoon cool off from the Arizona sun, or a sweet night cap to end the day."}
{"text":"I visited Sugar Fowl with my parents recently.  I was raised in Scottsdale and haven't been there since the 1990s -- I was excited to return there.

But I wasn't prepared for some nastiness.  The bussers, instead of putting dirty dishes on a hand tray and carrying them back to the kitchen, will roll out a big nasty wheeled cart into the dining area which is stacked with dirty dishes and also has a garbage bin attached to it.  So, you'll be sitting there trying to enjoy a meal and out comes the nasty smelling cart which is parked next to your table while the busser cleans a table next to you.  The cart smells bad, as you can imagine.  I've never seen that done before, even in a dive restaurant -- maybe in Tijuana, but certainly not Scottsdale!

So, I decided to phone Sugar Fowl and speak to the manager.  I expected him to be surprised at my news, and possibly apologize, but instead he was immedately defensive about the practice, saying they've always done that and are not going to change it.  I was speaking in a polite manner, but he was obviously having a bad day and used a rude tone of voice.  He said they do it because they have a high turnover of customers.  Really?  A McDonalds has five times more business than they ever will, and even they don't wheel out nasty carts!  Sugar Fowl also needs to train staff to clean the restrooms and pick up garbage from the dining area floors!

I read other negative reviews here on Yelp before visiting Sugar Fowl, but wanted to go there for nostalgic reasons anyway.  I should have believed the negative reviews.  The place has obviously gone downhill over the years.  I told the manager I would be posting a negative review here, and he said \"go ahead.\"  I recorded video of the busser performing the nasty table cleaning work, and posted it on YouTube for all to see.  People may not always believe words written here on Yelp, but they'll believe what they see with their eyes."}
{"text":"Good ice cream put poor systems. One cashier for busy night with a line to pay 20 deep..."}
{"text":"\"This is a great place for ice cream and a general fantastic place for lunch.  They have some pretty good sandwiches and salads if you are in the mood for lunch.  But the sandwiches are kind of small.  The place also has a bunch of the \"Family Circus\" cartoons on the wall and write in the Sugar Bowl into the cartoons.  It's interesting.  They have sundaes, cones, banana splits, and their own original concoctions.  It's a great place for some dessert or for a whole meal.  There was a lot of pink though and I just wasn't feeling that.\""}
{"text":"Love this spot! We take our son here for old school shakes, sundaes, and floats. Cute ambiance, great selections!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place out so we went there for a special treat for my son's birthday. 

The food (burgers)  was gross! Very gross. VERY gross! 
The server ignored my son (didn't even ask his drink order)  and couldn't have cared less that it was his birthday! 
The staff looked a little tired and very bored. 
We didn't wait around to try and get ice cream. We weren't feeling good after lunch! 
The place is cute with all the pink but it could use a good deep cleaning. I love Family Circus cartoons. 

I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Sugar Bowl is one of those places that people go to because it's got history, not necessarily service, and quality product.  There are actually much better ice cream shops in Old Town.  Take a better look on yelp if you are truly an ice cream lover. I had cancer 15 years ago and I really try to watch what I eat.  I LOVE ice cream and it is not something I eat often.  But now that I've found an ORGANIC shop it will be my go to place. If you're going to cheat on your diet, do it the best way you can. Sorry Sugar Bowl...I'm moving on."}
{"text":"The deluxe hamburger was well cooked, flavorful and very good. It is served with kettle plain chips (a lot) and pickle and cole slaw. Not a fan of slaw but it looked fresh. I also ordered the brownie sundae (Buster Brownie). For one thing, it was not worth $7.50. The single scoop of ice cream was soft and melting a lot when received (like the bowl was warm). The brownie was dry, lacked a fresh taste and served room temperature almost cold (usually brownies warmed when served with ice cream). It was also thrown on top of the sundae as though it was a last thought. Not what I was expecting. The marshmallow was thin and didn't match the menu description as thick and gooey. It lacked both of those things. Also the amount given was about a tablespoon at best. Seriously not a good sundae at all... save your money."}
{"text":"It's difficult to find a spot to wait for a seat. Two adults and a stroller have to constantly maneuver the swelling crowds, the busboy cart and the cashier kiosk. Fortunately we were seated quickly. I ordered a caramel ice cream soda. Everything looked and tasted great until I found a short black hair in my marshmallow sauce. These things happen not matter the quality of the restaurant; it's the risk you take for the convenience of eating out."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant! We've been here 3 times in the last 2 weeks and I can say I'm addicted! They have a great variety of bubble tea flavors, even different types of boba or jelly to put in the tea. We've been working our way through the menu and can honestly say everything has been tasty. My faves are the gyoza and the vegetable pho, I think it's P6 on the menu. I love the platter of fresh toppings they bring for the pho that allows you to really personalize your experience. 
Now let's talk desserts. BEST MACARONS I HAVE EVER HAD. Not only do they taste great, but they are ornately decorated as well (unicorns, brown bears, panda bears). Next time we go I want to try their Japanese cheesecake."}
{"text":"I wish I could say this place is still great, but it's far from what it used to be.  I was raised here in the Valley, and have been to SB many times as a kid, and many as an adults.  On my last 2 visits, I noticed just how far they've gone in not keeping this place up (especially on my last one).
Their desserts are of course what they;re known for, but you;d think a basic sandwich wouldn;t be too hard to make either.  But I've offically given up on their meals, as they regulalry use stale bread and what seems to be old ingredients.  Stale bread was served to us on both of the last 2 visits (my young daughter pointed it out, and I agreed that it was far from what  you'd expect).  The bread wasn't toasted, so there's no excuse.  My turkey was so dry (I laer ready a Health Dept. online inspection report stating that they admit to storing lefover meats for up to 3 days).  3 days isn;t terrible, but when you chareg nearly $10 for a sandwich, I wnat fresh meat and bread!
But the real problem was teh... BUGS!  Yes, tiny roaches or similar bugs (they almost looked like bed bugs) scurried out of the booth, from the crack between the back and seat portion of the booth.  We saw one run out jut after we ordered our meals.  We moved to another table (this time with chairs, and no booth!)... and guess what, we saw another one, this time slightly larger, scamper across the floor.
GROSS!!!
If they can't control the pests in the dining area, I'mscared to imagine what could be in the back/in the kitchen.
That was my last visit to Sugar Bowl for my family."}
{"text":"Fantastic pho! No need to travel to Cleveland anymore east siders! Fresh rolls are great the best I've had anywhere around here. Tried the carpaccio salad as well and it was awesome. Bubble tea was also very good. Have not tried the desserts yet but they look beautiful. Seating is limited so go when it's not peak hours or get take out. So glad this place moved in. I'm addicted !"}
{"text":"This place was all hype. The desserts were basic and the patty melt in ordered was messy and not seasoned at all. Prices too high for what they offer. But the service is where I was extremely disappointing. She was rude and never checked on us and we never got one refill on our waters. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"this is a cute lil ice cream parlor.  i'm so used to my baskin robbins/cold stone/yogurtland but i liked that this was different.  

i shared a Top Hat Sundae... which was basicially vanilla ice cream sandwiched between cream puff pastries and drizzled with chocolate syrup. it was alright. but i was too full from eating BBQ to even enjoy it.

i did play in the little game room but the games need much updating... i mean like that \"jump rope game\" where the lights go round and round; time crisis. The waitress that served us seemed a little off but i guess it was already late."}
{"text":"Well, I hate to do this, but feel I must.  I have lived in Scottsdale 25 years now, and have been to the Sugar Bowl many times.  I love the nostalgia of an ol' fashioned ice cream parlor; it reminds me of my childhood and eating hot fudge sundaes at the dairy parlor in Wisconsin.  I love the Bil Keane Family Circus caricatures hanging on the walls.  BUT... my visit to the Sugar Bowl on Tuesday, May 26th, with WI relatives, may be my last.

First of all, the prices on just about every food item are outrageous, considering this is not a fancy place by any means.  $10.95 for a lunch size chef salad?  $8 for a small egg salad sandwich on wonderbread?  Oh, the sandwich does come with stale potato chips, too.  

Second of all, the service was lousy.  Our waitress, who had \"1968\" displayed under her name on her name tag, certainly did not display the wealth of superior customer service one would expect from someone with 41 years of waitressing experience... just the contrary.   No warm welcome to the Sugar Bowl, no friendly smile, just a stern \"what do you want?\" to take our orders.  After waiting 20 minutes for our food, she came back to our table and announced \"Sorry, but the printer in the kitchen ran out of paper, so I need to retake your order\".  Okay, after repeating our orders, thinking that maybe our lunch would be \"on the house\" (or, at least, getting some sort of compensation), she just walked away without a word.  My lunch companions thought this was so odd (again, where's the awesome customer service one would expect from an establishment that should pride itself as being the highlight of the West's most western town???).  So, when she came back to our table to deliver a shake that my niece ordered, I piped up and asked \"So, do we get free ice cream sundaes for having to wait so long?\".  To our surprise, she said \"No.\".  After seeing our surprised looks, she suddenly changed her mind and said \"Well, you can get that shake free.\".

Okay, so we got something free out of the deal, but we all were extremely disappointed and bewildered.  Why?  Because we had to ask.   Doesn't a waitress with 41 years experience have any clout with the management to be empowered to offer compensation to a customer in order to promote great customer service (and ensure that the customer comes back as a repeat customer)?

The Sugar Bowl used to be a fun, inviting place to have an inexpensive lunch and enjoy a sweet dessert.  Now, it seems to be going downhill... fast.  I noticed that other, recent reviews have noted the same thing, and not many \"stars\"."}
{"text":"Awesome little diner that has been around for a long time.  Simple food and great deserts!"}
{"text":"So imagine the following scenario: You are browsing the sunday paper and hurray! You come across the funnies, you save Family Circus for last because it is a classic and surely will not disapoint. You get through everything else and at long last come to the Family Circus and after finishing, you remember that in fact; you have never read a funny Family Circus. In fact the only ones you find slightly enjoyable are the ones where little Billy is running around all hopped up on drugs and there is a dotted line left in his trail and you don't really get them either.

I am sure you are wondering where I am going with this. Sugar Bowl posts Family Circus comics all around the establishment and it is fitting as they are similar, in that you really think that you are going to enjoy both but both are huge let-downs.

I would really like to give this place one 1 1/2 stars but you know how it goes; I am a positive guy so I will round up. 

The thing is, sugar bowl is just the kind of place that a Yelper WANTS to like. It has been around for 50 years, locally owned and operated, it breaks the Scottsdale douche mold/stereotype and it is old school. It just doesn't manage to be charming and here is why.

First and foremost; the service sucked. When I went in, there were as many teenage kids working as people in the place and though I received a water super promply; giving me false high-hopes; I was then forced to wave down kids walking around avoiding eye contact like we had woken up together after a too-drunk night; in order to get water refills and order a burger. 

Secondly the food was meh. Really meh. Yeah I know it is an icecream joint but an old ice cream shop like this should have some tasty old-school burgers. You know who has better burgers? Dairy Queen. I swear to YHWH. Even the ice cream was very, very run of the mill.

Even the decor, while I enjoy the old soda shop sort of thing needs a little help. There are creepy old people houses and there are charming ones; figure out the difference really.

I am going to go beyond my jurasdiction here and give some suggestions hoping someone takes them to heart. I mean I don't know much; I am just a consumer but as a jumping point...
I hate to say this but Sugar bowl needs to let the theme run a bit with the Scottsdale atmosphere. Scottsdale wants to be LA and Sugar Bowl should also but they should do it better!

Scottsdale needs a hip late-night diner! Think about it! Get some great food stuffs, make your own toppings stay open late and charge a little more. And for the love of god take down the comics and paint the damn place or something! It could be a swingin joint where rock-stars, porn-stars and sport-stars meet up with the after club crowd. Look at how far people go to make it to Five and Diner and they aren't truly that great. Out-do them!

Sugar Bowl could do it. They really have the potential but as is I would have to be pretty desperate to hit this place up again."}
{"text":"Ambience great. Ice cream average. Service SUCKS. HORRIBLE. THE WORST. Seated at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon it took over an hour to get 5 simple ice cream orders. Waitress kept apologizing for the wait but sorry that doesn't cut it. Brought 4 waters out for 5 people. Kids water cups were promised but never delivered. Repeated requests for simple, basic items like napkins were ignored. The ice cream orders came out in an assortment of gloopy, gloppy messes of melted ice cream, fudges, sauces, and whip cream. The flavors all blended together into one indistinguishable overly sweet mess. You can get better tasting items at Dairy Queen or McDonald's. It's obvious this place rests its laurels on nostalgia because they fail in all other area of a decent restaurant. We will not be back."}
{"text":"The place is dirty, the staff is unfriendly, and the food is pretty poor. I had the hot dog and my wife had a grilled cheese. Nothing special especially for $12. We didn't have ice cream so that may be good by the place itself is nothing special"}
{"text":"Went to Sugar Bowl for dinner & ice cream. We had a cheeseburger & milk shakes (that DIDN'T come with French Fries OR whipped Cream; who does that!) The burger was completely tasteless... Certainly NOT grilled; watery. Toppings were fresh & delicious however. The decor is definitely vintage gone bad! Johnny Rockets does a better job with better tasting food & ENERGY! 

Overall, Sugar Bowl is cute, but needs a new Chef, uniforms for their staff (yoga pants are unprofessional), music & life breathed back into this tired restaurant that's seen better days."}
{"text":"I've lived in AZ for over ten years and have wanted to visit this spot in old Scottsdale for the longest time. Yesterday I finally got my chance now that I'm back in town. I ordered a banana split and my fianc√©e ordered a scoop of orange sherbet. The sizes of the scoops were enormous and super delicious on a 103 degree day. The place itself is decorated in pink and has that 50s dinner vibe that springs back to life. This place is a must while visiting old Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The Sugar Bowl is a cute little place for ice cream although they also serve food. We attended a birthday party today for a niece's 1st birthday. The event was scheduled for 2 - 4 pm.   I enjoyed the party, but I was disappointed with the Sugar Bowl:

1.  They did not take our order until an hour later and the food was not served to us until 1/2 hour before we were to clear out the party area.

2.  When they finally served our food and ice cream we were expected to gulp everything down  as the next party was waiting for us to finish.  This forced us to eat into the next party's time. 

3.  The quality of the food was so-so. For example, the Rueben sandwich had cabbage instead of sauerkraut and they used white bread instead of rye making the sandwich taste strange. 

We had heard such good things about them but after our experience with them I'm not sure we would go back again.  Perhaps anything but a party and just ice cream may be okay."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of old school ice cream parlors, and so naturally I went in to try this Family Circus institution called Sugar Bowl (along with apparently all the members of AARP), and I got the following:

* Really bad (extremely indifferent) service from some surly kid while seated at the counter.
* Mint chip ice cream with a Windex undertone. I know ice cream isn't good for you, but being downright toxic brings it to a whole new level.

All in all, pretty disappointing. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a Scottsdale landmark. We grew up with it. 
The food is ok. The ice cream is ok.  The inside is borderline gross. 
Come ON Sugar Bowl! Get with the program!! 

It's ok to offer more modern products like some local ice creams or burgers from one of our ranches. There is a way to make it a memorable experience and you're missing the mark. I see all of these tourists flooding in because it's \"iconic\" my god how embarrassing for we Arizonan's. 
Fix your flooring, get new wallpaper, allow the arcade to feel less South Glendale ghetto. I feel dirty when I leave the place, as if the floors & counters haven't been washed for years. I'm sure they have, codes and all you know - but they're old & they look dingy.

I want to love you. I grew up with you. But I am disappointed in you. Pick yourself up, brush off 1950 & embrace what the 21st Century is about. Clean food, supporting local, an interior that might LOOK mid-century but one we don't have to fear that the ghost of Bil Keane is going to swoosh out from under a sticky table. 

You can do it."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since I was a little kid and it's always great. The food is good and the service is always quick. The ice cream is also great and the hot fudge is probably the best I've ever had in my life. They even have a small arcade as well. I will be coming here for as long as it remains in business! Thanks Sugar Bowl!"}
{"text":"We saw this place from the car when we drove through \"oldtown\" Scottsdale and we knew we had to stop. 

It's an adorable little 50s style cafe. We skipped dinner and had only dessert. The huge sundaes were exactly what we were hoping for. Sweet, sugary and drenched in hot fudge and other toppings.

This is an old-fashioned family spot. Kids and adults will love it."}
{"text":"Good location & Love the pink, but the ice cream was just OK. Being that when I went, it was super crowded & had to wait a very long time to eat, It  just wasn't worth it for me. If you are in the area & the place is not busy, its worth the trip because the place is still very charming & makes you feel like you stepped into a 50's malt shop. Not too many places like this around anymore."}
{"text":"I always come here when I visit Scottsdale. They have the best grilled cheese in the world. The ice cream and service are both good too."}
{"text":"When we arrived it was slightly busy. We decided to sit at the bar assuming it would be quicker service. We sat there for 15 minutes while we watched others around us get served. Funny thing is, is the waiter behind the bar kept looking at us but never helped us.  Never did try the ice cream or food because we left.  Definately will not be going back."}
{"text":"Sugar Bowl is a good ol' fashioned ice cream parlor, kind of like something you'd see in a Norman Rockwell Painting, but updated slightly to fit the time. The ice cream attendant was super friendly, knowledgable, and was in general good humor (pun intended). Sadly, that's where the amazingness ends. The ice cream was no different from a Dreyer's, and while they were generous with the scoops and toppings, it wasn't super creamy, special, or game changing in any way. 

Now overall, did I enjoy myself? Absolutely! The Desireme Banana Split featured a scoop of vanilla, and a scoop of strawberry ice cream; melted marshmallow and fudge were delightfully drizzled atop the vanilla, while a strawberry sauce smothered the already strawberry ice cream. Both scoops came with ample dollops of whip cream and cherries on top, and everything was housed in between two banana halves cut at their sagittal plane.

Overall it was pretty delicious, but nothing transcendent, and I'm not sure this place deserved to be on the best ice cream shops in Arizona (according to PBS)."}
{"text":"It's an old fashioned ice cream place and the ice cream was delicious. It was packed when we went, but the waitress was able to get us in quick. We really liked the old time feel."}
{"text":"Come here for the Top Hat sundae, which is a big ice cream filled cream puff, or the Dusty Road, a chocolate and malt sundae. Come for the cute mural on the wall or the old Family Circle cartoons. And the location is perfect if you're taking visitors around to look at Old Scottsdale.
Don't come for the dirty walls, the booths that are falling apart or the dust-covered knick-knacks. Every time we go we end up having the same conversation- \"This place is always packed, they're making money. Why don't they clean the place up?\""}
{"text":"We ordered two milkshakes and it took over 20 minutes. Service was not good. First and only time coming here"}
{"text":"Vintage ice cream shop.
   Sugar Bowl is a throwback to the 1950's. With the pink and white tile floor and pink seats at the counter, one would expect to see poodle skirts, '57 Chevys and hot rods parked out front. Bill Keane even featured the Sugar Bowl in his comic strip \"Family Circus\". 
   We went on a Friday night with a large group of 16 people to celebrate birthdays. At 630 the place was not too busy but was packed by the time we left around 8. The table that had been held for us was tucked in a back corner of the room with games and the noise level was up, but since we were celebrating birthdays it was not an issue.
   Our sandwiches and desserts were delivered as they were completed so no one had a cold meal or melted ice cream. This also meant that our items did not arrive together but they were not widely spaced out. This was a change from what the teenage members of our party were used to but not a problem for the adults.
   The sandwiches were decent with the main drawback being the lack of french fries. They are not available, period. Sandwiches are served with kettle cooked potato chips and these are not made in house. I had a patty melt which also came with a basic cole slaw. The burger pattie was done medium well, as ordered, but was thicker than i would have expected for this sandwich. The onions were perfectly cooked and the cheese properly melted. Overall it was a good meal.
   Several members of our party ordered the Rueben which is served with mustard (for what reason I don't understand). If this is your choice be aware of this. They will gladly leave the mustard off. The 'Bacon on Burger' cheese burgers looked great but the cheese was simply laid on top of the bacon and not melted. 
   Now we move to the ice cream. This is why you need to stop in. The sundaes are massive, the shakes and malts are hand made, and you can get a classic Ice cream soda. I ordered the cherry soda and was not disappointed. It was even had an extra sidecar of soda to freshen it up as you enjoyed it.
   Overall this is a nice place to stop in for dessert when walking around Old Town Scottsdale.

Warm Fuzzies (the good stuff)
-Classic soda shop.
-Fantastic ice cream desserts.

Cold Baldies (the not so good stuff)
-Sandwiches are just ok.
-Restrooms are hard to find and compact.
-Noise level is a little high.
-Service is spotty."}

{"text":"The Buster Brownie, a brownie with a scoop of ice cream on top, was out of this world. The atmosphere is fun and inviting fusing pink into nearly every aspect of the place. A great place to bring a date."}
{"text":"I love that walking through the doors of the Sugar Bowl is like taking a step back in time but what I don't love is that it looks like it hasn't been cleaned or had any restoration work done since the day it opened. Lets be honest though, I didn't come here for the decor, I came for the ice cream. 

I was very excited when I saw the sundae covered in chocolate, cherries and marshmallow creme. I love marshmallow creme and chocolate, always a recipe for success when these two ingredients are combined. Well, no luck. They were out of marshmallow creme. I got a brownie sundae instead, only ate half and decided that it was only ok. 

I probably won't go back to this place. There are too many good dessert options out there. Though if my friends insisted, I would more than likely oblige."}
{"text":"This place is quick, cute, and simply delicious. It's almost like a portal back in time! Keep up the good stuff."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here yesterday for the second time in less than a week. Both times we split the Do-It-Yourself Banana Split, which was delicious. I have to tell you, this is a great ice cream parlor. It has a great comfortable feel to it. Kind of like you're going back in time to an old fashioned ice cream parlor from the fifties, but the best part was the ice cream. I'm not sure if they make their own ice cream but this stuff was delicious. For a great dessert place I highly recommend the Sugar Bowl."}
{"text":"OMG!!! I have been going here for years!  I remember I would go here everytime I went and got my braces tightened because my mom always thought I deserved a special treat!  The reason that I am giving it 4 stars is because the food just does not compare to the ice cream treats!!  I love the malts...I love the rootbear sodas...the brownie and marshmellow sundae...the banana split with hot fudge and caramel.  All the treats are fabulous!  It is perfect for families and kids!  I am looking forward to the day that I bring my son here!  It is right in the heart of old town scottsdale and it is so cute...it has not changed in the 17 years that I have gone here!  I love it and I will always be a fan!  Everyone should try this place at least once!"}
{"text":"Went there expecting a grand place with all different ice cream and tons of sweets and sugar and I was not impressed. We walked in and the floor was absolutely disgusting, the restaurants smelt old & like pee, the tables were very worn out as were the chairs and bar. We got out order Togo to walk around downtown outside the shops which was nice, but it just tasted like normal Dryers ice cream you can get at the grocery store. Definitely highly recommend a re-vamp at this place & a deep clean. Won't be back for a long time unfortunately."}
{"text":"I loved the sugar bowl! You can go in and order an old school root beer float, ice cream, or even a chocolate soda! Yum it's a must stop to cool off and check out the old 50's decor!"}
{"text":"Went in to have a drink, and tried the strawberry milkshakes - wow! Absolutely great - they give you straws and spoons to drink/eat them with, but we found the straws difficult to use as the shakes were so full of fruit and thick ice cream - yummy! Will come back here again!"}
{"text":"Neat diner - really one of a kind in Phoenix
I've been to the Sugar Bowl a few times. It's a fun place for the family, good burgers, GREAT ice cream, a good place for lunch or to take your kids."}
{"text":"The food is good, but not great.  They have awesome ice cream, shakes, floats, etc!!!  My children really enjoyed!"}
{"text":"This place is in a time warp, but it's awesome. The menu itself is antiquated BUT IN A WAY THAT I LOVE. You get this delicious banana bread with cream cheese dressing when you order a salad. Its delish!! I have also had a turkey salad sandwich and a tuna one on two separate occassions. I really enjoyed the turkey salad sand, the tuna was ok. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I have to say I was a little let down after all of the hype for this place. I was excited. Local ice cream parlor that has been here for a long time must be really good. I did like the old school look of the place. Even the small arcade they had on the other side of the restaurant even though three of the games were out of order still cool. Now I will say I didn't try any of their food but it is an ice cream parlor so you would think the ice cream would be heavenly.
A friend of mine and I went to a movie down the street and were driving home after wards when we spotted it down the street. We had both wanted to try it some day. So I decided today was some day and we pulled in. We had to hunt for a parking space, no big deal, until one popped up right in front of us. We walked inside and waited a minute to be seated. The waitress was very nice and sat us in a booth in the corner right in front of a very nice mural on the wall. She handed us the menu and I realized I had no idea what they had or what I wanted. So I started to scour the menu that is when I realized they had more than ice cream. That was a nice surprise since silly me assumed they only had ice cream but ice cream was what I came for and what they are know for. I finally picked out the Buster Brownie. Brownie with ice cream and marshmallow topping sounded delicious. My friend picked the same thing. We called the waitress over because we were finally ready to order. We placed our order and then were informed we could pick out ice cream flavor if we wanted. Oooo added bonus. I got chocolate and my friend cookies n cream.
It didn't take too long to come out and looked mouthwateringly good. Then the let down. It was good but not spectacular. Not special. The brownie was a fudge brownie which is good but is a little on the hard side. I was expecting a cake brownie all warm and gooey with the ice cream. The marshmallow topping didn't add too much either. I was let down.
I guess I like the corporate place better. I was really hoping the local place would blow them away but sadly no. Also as much as people gripe about the prices at the corporate ice cream store these where about the same.
I might go back if I am in the neighborhood again but won't be making any special trips. I will stick to the corporate ice cream store which I'm sure some will call me crazy for saying."}
{"text":"An old-fashioned Ice Cream place in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale?  Sign me up.  I'll be back.

Lots and lots of pink on the inside, a long counter where you can sidle up and order if you don't want to wait and plenty of tables and booths if you don't mind waiting a couple minutes.

Service: Service was a little slow given that we were only ordering ice cream sundaes and not hot food, but this was a very minor problem.

Food:  We came just for dessert and ordered a Top Hat Sundae (creampuff filled with ice cream and topped with hot fudge) and a Tin Roof Sudae (ice cream, hot fudge, and salted Spanish peanuts).  Both were very good.  The salty peanuts were a great addition to the sweetness in the ice cream.  As for the Top Hat Sundae, the creampuff was good.  Perhaps not right out of the oven, but still good."}
{"text":"We went here last night before dinner to grab a snack while we waited on our reservations at a restraurant nearby. The place is charming with its 1950s traditional ice cream parlor decor all done up in pink and white. In the back room there is a half way done kid's area with a couple of old games.

 Although the atmosphere is sweet on the surface and the staff was nice- the place lacks in cleanliness. The floors were dingy (they need a good strip, scrub and wax) and the restrooms were hideous and dirty! I'm with the previous reviewers in that the place needs a good cleaning.

Our group ordered a few cones and while my rasberry sherbert was good- we'll likely be going elsewhere for a sugar fix next time."}
{"text":"This place has been here from the 60s and I would say very little has changed.  It's an old school ice cream parlor.  The seats are not very comfortable but that just adds to the authenticity of this charming place!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Awkward line set up if you just want an ice cream cone.  Would be nice if they had line markers so everyone didn't block the door. Also would be cool if you could just pay at the counter instead of then having to wait for the cashier. Anyway, just a place to stop in downtown Scottsdale which is kind of on the lame side anyway. IMO."}
{"text":"That is some good ice cream. 5 stars all the way. Portions are great, just wish they had a bigger bowl so they could fit all my scoops in one. So, the mint chocolate chip is fantastic, and the hot fudge is incredible. The caramel is a very running consistency which was very odd, the taste was okay though. Stick to hot fudge. Will be going back for more. Bigger bowls please."}
{"text":"We ordered the pho, sandwich, chicken sticks, the rangoon's and a bowl of rice. The pho broth was tasty but the portion was so small my 5 your old son could eat on his own. The sandwich had less meat than the 4 chicken stick we order on the side. The chicks stick where tasty but small portion. The cost was not a single $ and we did leave hungry. I would also say this is not child friendly our 20 month old had to held will eating do to no high chair?"}
{"text":"It wasn't really bad, but it wasn't great, either. Two different people recommended this popular Old Town eatery, but we're not sure why. It was packed and seemed to only have one server, who managed to keep her dignity, but we felt bad for her. We were sat in the arcade room, despite having no kids, and I wish we had asked to wait for a table in the main room. The food was fine, very basic American diner food, although the special, beef strogonoff, was quite good. The \"elegante\" salad was just a big bowl of iceberg lettuce with a few pieces of turkey, a few strips of bacon, a few cherry tomatoes and olives. It was fresh, but mostly lettuce. The ice cream seemed very popular, but we only got one shake at our table. Probably a great place if you have younger kids, and need some respite from heat or sight-seeing/shopping."}
{"text":"I've been living locally the past 14 years and didn't try the Sugar Bowl until just last night. I love that you can sit at a table and be helped by a server just for dessert. The menu was full of classics and different concoctions of ice creams, sauces, and other sweets--the hardest part of our visit there was making a decision. I opted for the Buster Brownie (sub out the chocolate for caramel), my boyfriend enjoyed the Top Hat Sundae and OMG--yumbo. 

Overall this place has the right price, impressive dessert, and a super cute atmosphere. Great date night spot for Old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was just total rudeness but for no reason i could see the hostess didn't want myself, husband and children to sit in the very front corner table of the cafe when absolutely no one else but we were there to be seated and that table was available... She literally sighed and rolled her eyes but just couldn't come up with any reason other than it didn't have enough room despite my asking for it which I could clearly see it did have plenty of room and thats why i asked for it, it was very strange. Then I lost my daughters ring in the bathroom, took it off to wash my hands, placed it on the table in the restroom (ugh i can't believe I forgot as it was the only bright shiny gold and ruby thing on a black table) and idiotically forgot to pick it back up and of course you'd think someone would kindly give it to the restaurant for lost & found but I guess no guests nor staff were honest enough or kind enough.  I guess someone just took it home for themselves.  Selfish, sad world we live in today.  I thought it would be such a fun place to sort of go back in time, but then I remembered a less warm memory about past times and who was allowed to be sat in diners and that is a very sad thought to remember."}
{"text":"Still one of the best ice cream shops in the Scottsdale area.  A quaint, ice cream shop that takes you back in time.  The food was really good.  We had a burger that was absolutely delish and a tuna on toast with sourdough bread (doesn't that sound delish?)  and of course the choices of desserts/icecream/sundaes make it quite difficult to choose but its all good!  
Be sure to stop by and eat the Dutch Chocolate Ice-cream for me."}
{"text":"My son and I have been here a few times while in Arizona for Spring Training. Killer ice cream treats. Huge portions, so plan on splitting or go hungry. Also have a fun game room that little kids would like a lot."}
{"text":"Imagine you're back in the good ol' days, the 50s the era of malt shops with an arcade room. The decor makes it easier to feel in the 50s, we had the Buster Brownie and it was all we expected and more: delicious, not overly sweet just the right balance of sweet and the brownie was the perfect texture. To top it all off a maraschino cherry and whipped cream with a glass of ice cold water on the side. Parking was easy to find. Our server was very friendly and gave us enough time to decide what we wanted. The menu has comics from Bill Kane and as you pay your bill at the register look up to the top right corner to find a comic with a handwritten message from Kane himself."}
{"text":"My niece loves her banana split it was her first time having a banana split. It was quite busy but it was a Friday which means the food is good the service was okay but I know that they were busy I would definitely go back the prices are very reasonable especially for Old Town"}
{"text":"The sugar bowl is a must see place.so adorable with the pink.my only critisism is that i think the arcade room cheapens the place.i know its for the kids but honestly e kids would come anyway for the icecream and the vibe why throw in a really cheap chuck e cheese arcade?
Otherwise its an old school gem."}
{"text":"We came here to eat ice cream for my dads birthday since it's the only parlor in the area, the grandkids loved the arcade and the huge portions. Since the main attraction is the ice cream naturally its pricier... The pink chairs and booths are cute and add nicely to the ambiance without taking over to make guys uncomfortable lol!"}
{"text":"My date & I went to the Sugar Bowl to conclude a date night and we were both in the mood for a banana split. This is definitely the only place I've ever been to that has multiple banana split options to choose from!

We ended up selecting the Desireme Banana Split which had a banana, only vanilla ice-cream (no strawberry ice-cream per my request), marshmallow sauce, strawberries, and whipped cream with a cherry on top.

I think it's always busy at Sugar Bowl so it was a bit of a wait to get our ice-cream but we didn't mind. When the banana split was delivered to us, we saw that the portion size was absolutely massive! Unfortunately, even though it looked great, it left a lot to be desired. We didn't find anything special about their ice-cream; it tasted like what freezer section store ice-cream and the strawberries & marshmallow sauce didn't really enhance anything. In fact, I think in this dessert, the two toppings just made it a sloppy mess.

It was great to have this experience because I've heard quite a bit about Sugar Bowl, but I don't really see myself going out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"Good food (ice cream sundae). But I am harsh with businesses who provide poor service. Two older men were working here and they had horrible customer service skills. I think one of them is the owner. 

My advice is get some friendly staff to handle customers."}
{"text":"Oh my, how could you top the ice cream at this place.  My hubby got a three scoop banana split, which he raved about.  Believe me, he knows banana splits, has them every chance he gets.
And I had my Sugar Bowl favorite, the Top Hat sundae!!! A delicious cream puff with vanilla ice cream in the middle and topped with loads of delicious hot fudge and whipped cream.
Wonderful!!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. This place is not good at all. Sugar Bowl might have sentimental value to Scottsdale locals but it doesn't serve quality food or ice cream. With so many other great restaurants in the area, I'm surprised this place is still open. The decor is untidy, the food is boring, and the ice cream is average at best."}
{"text":"A Scottsdale institution. Hit this place after an after-dinner stroll for some ice-cream. Can't comment on the food. It works as an old-fashioned ice-cream shop."}
{"text":"Old fashioned ice cream parlor that has some of the best sundaes. We had the banana split sundae and PB&J sandwich. The ambience is wonderful and we would totally visit it again."}
{"text":"Dear Sugar Bowl, 

I love your location and your friendly service. I also love your ice cream menu-- the different things I can get that are sugary and delicious sounding. I like they you're very characteristic of Old Town Scottsdale and that you run a tight old-fashioned ship. However, I just don't like your ice cream. It's just...\"OK.\" You're just not as creamy as Mary Coyle and sometimes the compression in your crop has just too much air, giving me kind of a freezer burnt feel on my tongue. I still love you though. I hope that we can stay friends.

All the best, 
Frances"}
{"text":"This is the best place to go for an authentic 1950s ice cream parlour experience.  Try the Camelback soda or a super soda to feel really Leave It To Beaver-ish.   Sit at the stools at the bar for an extra authentic feel.  Pay for your tab at the cashier booth for a real blast from the past.

Don't expect to order anything healthy at Sugar Bowl, or attempt to stick to your diet.  It's ALL BAD for you, and I LOVE it.  I got my ice cream soda with EXTRA HOT FUDGE lining, and I loved it.  Who else LOVED it, you ask??

24 HOUR FITNESS, baby!!  I'm hauling my calorie-laden ass over there every day for the next week.  It's all good.  It's worth it.  Who the eff cares if the ice cream could be fresher?  The food here is probably average, but the experience and ambiance bump it up an extra star. 

P.S.  This is very reminiscent of Farrells for the SoCal peeps out there."}
{"text":"DH came to take me to lunch to celebrate a new job in a new city (oh....this burgh girl isn't too sure about this yet...). I had heard about the Sugar Bowl from some locals and it was only a block away - I thought why not? 

It is definitely retro.And pink. Very pink. Way too pink.  The only thing missing is the hair nets.  I don't think they have remodeled since opening 58 years ago and, according to DH, they haven't cleaned the men's room during that time either ;)

We didn't do dessert and maybe we should have because lunch was not anything to write back home about.  They advertised corn chowder as the soup of the day - and I was so ready for a good bowl of soup. It just wasn't happening. It was - and I am ready to bet the bank on this - a can of creamed-style corn with some diced boiled potatoes and a few sprinkles of bacon. That was it. Corn chowder? Not even close. No white sauce. No cream base. Nothing. A can of cream-style corn.

Now, I am the first to admit - you can make a good quick chowder out of that can - but you need to do a little white sauce, a little butter, some seasonings. Just dumping it - no, that is not acceptable.

And not even hot -

At $4.50 a bowl, you got less than a cup of soup as measured in any other restaurant. It was in a shallow tiny bowl, almost monkey dish size.

DH order the turkey sandwich. Meh. It was turkey and bread and lettuce and mayo. No tomato.  Served with chips. Not worth the $8 price tag for sure.

I ordered a side of their nut bread with cream cheese. It was okay. Not bad, not great, Ok.

For $18+ for a sandwich, a Diet, a cup of soup, and nut bread, it was not worth it at all. 

All in all, not worth a lunch trip again - although the place was slowly filling up with locals (mostly older).  Maybe I will try dessert there some time but as far as food goes....these boots will keep on walking...."}
{"text":"Garishly pink, old school ice cream parlor with adjacent arcade in the heart of old town Scottsdale. I adore thee, Sugar Bowl, even if ice cream and I do not get along particularly well. Pass on the food (there are numerous better places for dinner nearby), but definitely stop here for a sundae or a scoop. (And, maybe some arcade games...Ahem.) The last time I was there, the place was full of hipsters, families, prom dates getting ice cream, older couples, pretty much everyone. It's pretty great."}
{"text":"The ice cream and sherbet was absolutely delicious. 3 stars though because the furniture and tables need an upgrade. It was so cold and uncomfortable I wished i got my order to go..."}
{"text":"In the best interest of everyone, due to my minor lactose intolerance, I don't do ice cream often.  But, Sugar Bowl is worth it!!  No, it is not the fancy shmancy ice cream infused with liqueur, or homemade, hand-churned with all natural ingredients from the desert...It is just good, old, run-of-the-mill, GOOD ice-cream.  Ice-cream is kind of like pizza, the bad stuff is still pretty good, and this is definitely better than most.  What sets Sugar Bowl apart is the old fashion style sundaes with whip cream and cherries (the philosophy of if it isn't broken why fix it definitely applies here), along with the traditional, charming, atmosphere of an old-school ice-cream parlor.  

I would tell you my favorite desserts, but you might as well look at the menu because I would have typed the majority of it.  I have only had dessert here and not tried the food, but I don't really think the 'food' is what you come here for.  

Sugar Bowl takes me  back to being a kid and making my own sundaes at home...it HAD to be in the 'fancy' ice-cream dish, with a cute spoon to eat it with, and LOTS of chocolate!  And that is what makes it worth the hour long belly ache afterward ;)"}
{"text":"I usually love this place. It's been a great little spot of good dessert after a meal up in old town. But after doing much research and reading the other reviews, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. The fact that multiple people have said they have encountered cockroaches at this establishment, no way Jose for me."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I saved room for dessert while walking around Old Town. Sugar Bowl looked like an old soda shoppe. There were clips of Family Circus in their menus and autographed copies on the walls and at the cashier station.

I didn't try the food, I came in strickly for some sugary goodness. I went with the desire me banana split, and let me tell you- It will not dissapoint. Strawberry and vanilla ice creams, sliced banana and strawberries, whipped cream and a cherry. Yum!!

There's also an arcade attached to the restaurant, it looked like it had tables as well, so it'd be great for visiting with kids."}
{"text":"It took a while to get waited on, but the man behind the counter made me the best chocolate milkshake I've ever had my entire life. It was thick, very chocolatey, and creamy. I could've drank three of them! If you want to great milkshake, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I came here all the way from LA because I heard great things about this place. The day I went, it was VERY hot, 102 degrees. I did not realize that they close at 5PM and I got there 5 before 5PM. I figured, they would accommodate me since 2 other women walked in the same time I did. They were kind enough to accommodate the two women but told me they could not serve me because it is close to 5PM. I will never come here ever again."}
{"text":"We discovered this place as we were following the Old Town Scottsdale Walking Tour. This place has been around for over 50 years and it still preserves a cute retro vibe. 

They offer a decent sized menu of desserts and hot food, but with a name like Sugar Bowl it is obvious that this place specializes in sweets. Also, there are so many great dining options in Scottsdale; there is probably no reason to come here for lunch or dinner unless it is convenient for you or your family. Go to dinner or lunch in one of Scottsdale's fine restaurants, then make your way over to the Sugar Bowl for an awesome dessert. Everything on the dessert menu sounds delicious. The gentleman sitting next to us ordered this gigantic brownie sundae that looked amazing. We skipped the sundae's and ordered camelback sodas. My girlfriend got a super camelback soda with marshmallows, but in my opinion, it tasted just like my regular camelback soda. Regardless, both were delicious and really hit the spot after walking in the desert sun for most of the afternoon. 

I really loved the vibe of this place. Retro ambiance, friendly service, and some of the best sweets in the desert. Perfect."}
{"text":"Server with buzz haircut as rude. Place was dirty. Sure the interior is kitsch and cute in a 1950's way but the quality isn't great"}
{"text":"We went to this place on Monday night.  OMG.  So nostalgic for me and my husband who grew up with Swensen's.  It's the same idea with a limited food menu and a very extensive ice cream sundae/dessert/milkshakes/soda menu.  The place looks like it was taken from the 50's with the cute pink decor and real soda fountain.  We could do without the mini-arcade next door.  Prizes are lame for the amount of tickets required (100 tickets for a small bouncy ball).  It was great fun and our kids were asking to go back.

The Sugar Bowl is located in Old Town Scottsdale, so it is in a really cute section of town."}
{"text":"Really like the ice cream here..especially the Top Hat Sundae...yum!! Atmosphere is adorable, so huge fan of this place. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the actual food they serve is sort of average. The ice cream though....well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite ice cream place in the country. I live in Illinois and when I go visit Arizona, it's a must do. I loved it as a kid and I love it now! I recomend the strawberry ice cream shakes!"}
{"text":"Gotta try the Soda's. I had a great black raspberry soda with Dutch chocolate ice cream. Really an OMG Experience!"}
{"text":"Great water.  Food was something I would have made in college for myself.  After 30m+ of waiting I considered ghosting...should have."}
{"text":"I know this is an iconic restaurant in Scottsdale and was hoping for much more. There are only a few flavors of ice cream.  While the Top Hat sundae and the malt were good, the ice cream cone was just so-so. The ice cream does not taste home made - I'm guessing Blue Bell???

The decor is tired - I remember this restaurant looking exactly the same way 25 years ago!

The service was poor and our waitress barely spoke above a whisper."}
{"text":"We stumbled into Sugar Bowl while looking for a pre-dinner treat after wandering around Old Town Scottsdale.   We saw ice cream on the menu, which is always a good option.

The restaurant has the look and feel of a real old-time diner/soda fountain.  Something straight out of Leave it to Beaver or Pleasantville.  In addition to ice cream, sundaes, and shakes they also offer hot entrees like burgers and meat loaf.  I can't vouch for the food but I did overhear the table next to us tell the waitress that \"the soup is cold.\"

We got two scoops to share - Turkish coffee and almond pralines.  Both were pretty dense yet creamy and definitely high on the sweetness level.   Almond praline was probably our preferred flavor."}
{"text":"A classic ice cream spot. Excellent service. Very good ice cream. Go for the chocolate shake. I did....twice!!  Only gripe would be some malt shops make it big and give you the tin. Wish they would do that (I'd even pay a small up charge)."}
{"text":"If you're into old fashioned diners, the Sugar Bowl is right up your alley. It's a great place to bring  the whole family and not spend too much. Service is usually pretty good, but either way their sundaes are delicious. I recommend the Dusty Road Sundae.

I'll admit the decor is a little outdated but I like that it doesn't change. If you're in the area you should definitely stop by. There's a little arcade for the kids as well."}
{"text":"A Scottsdale icon with a lot of pretty desserts with a lot of attractive people.  The place makes creative and affordable desserts of mostly ice cream and has an adjoining room with antiques and games.  The place is truly a wonderful treat and can be busy on weekend evenings."}
{"text":"Scottsdale being a \"newer\" city compared to \"back east\", it's hard to find authentic classic places.  The Sugar Bowl takes you right back to the good times - simply, classic ice cream.  Loved the peanut butter and chocolate ice cream with hot fudge.  The place shows a little wear and tear, and there's not a lot of handicap parking close by - which rates the 4 stars not 5."}
{"text":"OH I love this place! The charm of it is irresistable!! You have to get the little \"finger sandwiches\" and the sundae's are yummy! They have so many to choose from!  Also..my very FAVORITE item on the menu is the banana nut bread with cream cheese in the center and then another piece of banana nut  bread on top..mmmmmmmmmmm OMGosh , it is soooo yummmy!! the best....and its just so cute...and a great place to cool off and get out of the heat of the day!"}
{"text":"Awesome desserts!  Never tried the food!  Why waste the room?  Life's short, eat dessert first!"}
{"text":"The desserts here are to die for. Everytime I go, I always get the cream puff ice cream dessert and never regret it.

The food is definitely not my favorite and the service has been pretty slow the past few times I have come, even when it's not packed full of people, which is why it's not 5 stars. It's definitely a unique dining experience so for that reason alone, I would advise anyone who hasn't visited SugarBowl, to check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is a good throwback that has legendary food. I ordered a grilled cheese and it tasted phenomenal, especially with the great gooey cheese. I also ordered the Golden Nugget which was great tasting. This restaurant has been around for a long time, I understand why."}
{"text":"I've been coming here forever and it's always amazing and has never changed! A true Arizonan treasure! If you are visiting from out of town you must see this place, it will make you happy."}
{"text":"You yelpers hit it right on the nose.

1. The decor and building need need needs to be redone, I know it's nice to look old school and all, but there IS a difference between old school and ghetto. Stickiness is a big gross factor.

2. The waft of different smells: teenagers, sandwiches, malts & ice cream mixed into a cloud- YUCK.

3. Prices are decent.

4. It will take a while to order or to pay (especially on a weekend night). Be patient with the employees even though they do take a while to make eye contact/help you... I'm guessing they don't get paid much for scooping ice cream."}
{"text":"What a fun, old-school ice cream parlor! After walking around Old Town Scottsdale all day, it was the perfect treat! They had quite a menu of ice cream desserts, and we enjoyed the ice cream sodas- took my mom back to my age. They were great and yummy."}
{"text":"The ice cream is good, but it's way overpriced. The decor is something out of the 50s. It's a cool place to visit once, but you'd be better off going to cold stone."}
{"text":"My cousin recommended going here. Read the reviews and decided to try it. Very clean and staff continued to clean when we were there. The coffee milkshake is a classic. WOW!!!
The small hot fudge sundae was more than enough. The fudge is not too thick and not too thin which means it is JUST RIGHT.
We had a friendly waitress who was very attentive. Cute napkins too!"}
{"text":"My uncle owned a restaurant nearby since the 70's and I remember Sugar Bowl being here for the longest time. I'm glad that it has withstood the test of time and I consider it a historical landmark now. It looks like an old ice cream and soda store from the 50's and 60's. I've always liked the ice cream here and try to make it a stop every time I come to Scottsdale. 


Visited June 2012"}
{"text":"The shop was so hot! We were sweating.
Our ice cream arrived half-melted.
Kinda pricy for melted ice cream.
Table service was slow and spotty
This was our first time here, and I'm not sure we'll be back.  I thought that this place would be fun for our date night.  Not really."}
{"text":"While the ice cream was good it didn't make up for how filthy the restaurant was. There were places that looked like they hadn't ever been cleaned. The pie tasted just like costco apple pie. When we asked if they bakwd their own pies rhe ssid it was from their wholesaler. Id guess costco and its clean there! I don't understand how this became a phoenix classic"}
{"text":"Tried this place b/c we heard that it is somewhat historical.  Definitely not fancy, decently priced ice cream parlor.  Nothing special.

*Decor = had it's own charm.  nothing fancy.
*Service = it took a while for the waitress to come but it's all good.  They were having fun mingling with their high school friends at the counter :)
*Ice cream = it's good.  I mean it's definitely not Ghirardelli but it's descent.  

Would I go there again.  Well, just for Sugar Bowl - NO.  If I'm out of Blue Bell ice cream at home and for some reason I'm in Scottsdale, SURE."}
{"text":"This is an old school ice cream parlor and restaurant. I am not too crazy about the entire pink decor, but I go there to eat ice cream. They make ice cream concoctions that are legendary. From sundaes to banana splits, served in classic glassware. It's a great place to go back in time and enjoy a wonderful ice cream experience."}
{"text":"We were visiting again, so of course that means at least 2 trips to Sugar Bowl!  The food, service and ice cream were good as always, but WOW, the prices sure have gone up.  I know that the economy sucks, but for what we got, the prices just don't seem to justify it.  We had different waitresses both times.  The fist was efficient but not very warm.  We had Sandra on our second visit - and YES, she remembered us again!  Could not believe it.  She is very friendly and can really keep up when they get swamped.  We will be back, but maybe only once per visit instead of 2 (or 3 or 4) times.  Just can't afford those prices for what you get."}
{"text":"Sarah was our server, sweet as the dessert on their menu & took good care of all 5 of us! Sugar bowl reminds me of the old fashioned ice cream parlors I've only seen on black and white tv. They have burgers & sandwiches, not just dessert as I had imagined driving by all these years.Of course this girl had dessert, the Desireme Banana Split, yes still living in sweats and pajama jeans or Thanksgiving pants as our server coined them! Worth it, right down to the last drop of marshmellow sauce!!! There unfortunately was an issue with my Patty melt, I'm not one to complain but the thing was still mooing, they were swift to correct the issue(at no charge)and exchanged it for a quieter, more cooked version! We all enjoyed dessert, dinner & even games in their arcade, it was a fabulous family night out!"}
{"text":"Went for dessert this evening. We have eaten dinner here before and thought we owed it to the place to try what they are known for, their desserts. 

Tonight we ordered two scoops (mint chocolate and chocolate chip), a tin roof Sundae and a Rock Road Sundae. The server was there, he didn't seem too enthusiastic about it, but our desserts and coffee arrived quickly. The coffee was one of the worst cups of coffee I've ever had. The desserts were good, a little over priced for what you recieve, but we're tasty.

The atmosphere needs work, menus are torn and sticky, our tables salt and pepper shakers were covered in ice cream and chocolate, the place smells musty and looks like it could all use a good cleaning."}
{"text":"This place was such a throwback, I loved it! The interior atmosphere was adorable, I felt like a little kid! Cute mural paintings too...I'm from Rhode Island where we take ice cream very seriously all year (despite temperatures a third of Scottsdale's) and this was good stuff. Wish they had more flavors though; the menu is expansive but in terms of actual ice cream and sauce flavor choices I was underwhelmed. That said, the hot fudge was amazing and a must!! Get the larger size sundae (I think it's called paradise? Apt, that.) because reasons. Finally: leave the cash tip at the table and then you pay at a counter on your way out, kind of like Denny's (I think. Is that a Denny's thing?) We only knew to do this from watching the couple at the next table over and our waitress not coming back with a bill- kinda confusing."}
{"text":"My family went to celebrate a special day with my mother for Mother's Day.  This place has always held a special spot in our family tradition, BUT, no longer!  We were never greeted and the service was absolutely TERRIBLE!  We were treated with annoyance.  We waited a very long time to receive our order and when we ordered ice cream to took like 45 minuets for a three ice creams.  The manager felt it was MORE important to change the light bulbs then help service the customers!  Well waiting, what seemed like hours, we stared at dirty dishes as the bus boys and waiter walked by several times. My mom said, \"If I wanted stare at dirty dishes, I would have stayed home!\""}
{"text":"Last time I checked, customer service for family and community orientated businesses was supposed to be key.  Unfortunately, the owners of the Sugar Bowl are not equipped to provide any friendliness-factor.

It's okay that the Sugar Bowl doesn't do group events, but the way to communicate that information to your customers isn't \"I'm really going to pass. No. I need to interrupt because the answer is no.\" There are so many ways to communicate a message, but rudeness is a way to lose business fast.

History or no history, the Sugar Bowl has lost this customer for good."}
{"text":"After years of hearing friends rave about this infamous ice cream parlor, me and my boyfriend decided to go there for a date. Upon entering the restaurant, we both were met with a less than pleasant greeting. The restaurant had a very \"stale\" vibe... Nobody was smiling- customers and staff included. It was pretty busy which we had expected because it is a popular place, especially on a Saturday afternoon. After being seated, we noticed how dirty everything felt... Flies everywhere, sticky menus, sticky table, water glasses looked cloudy, etc. We were served quickly- my boyfriend ordered a vanilla sundae with cherry sauce and chocolate marshmallows sauce- his ice cream arrived as if it were soup. The few bites of solid ice cream were freezer burned. My sundae was fine, but nothing I couldn't have made at home. While we were waiting for our check, we joked about how the place felt haunted. I can't express how eery and unhappy the whole place seemed. Nobody seemed happy to be there. I went on Yelp while sitting there to read reviews because I was appalled at how horrible the place was. I wish I had checked BEFORE we had made the drive from the west valley. When we went to the cashier, the manager rung us up. He didn't look up once or say ONE word. Nothing. Basically, we will never go there again and will never recommend this place."}
{"text":"The Sugar Bowl is an institution that has been around for centuries. The ice cream is delicious, the sundaes are incredible, and the milkshakes are great too. I really enjoy the interior too with all the \"Family Circus\" cartoons around the restaurant. This place is a must go!"}
{"text":"This is the first Yelp Review I've ever really agonized over. 

The Sugar Bowl is an Old Town Scottsdale class. 
Bright pink exterior, and old fashioned Letters in the window. 
The interior has the same kitchie charm. Family Circus Comics all over, cute old fashioned bricabrac in the store, and on the walls. 

But the food, the food is... well awful. 
I ordered the \"assorted finger sandwiches\" - and the bread was stale, and in addition to tuna salad, and egg salad, there is some kind of... ham salad. When I asked about what was in the finger sandwiches, telling me a ham sandwich, might have been more acuratly described as a \"ham salad sandwich\" - I took a bite, and left the rest alone. 

The ice cream is good, nothing special.
The sundaes are fun, again nothing special. 

But there is something that makes me bring my out of town guest here, when a trip to Cold Stone might be tastier. 

I hope someone comes in, improves the menu, but keeps the charm."}
{"text":"Sugar Bowl is a fun, whimsical ice cream shop in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. It's cheap, yummy and makes you feel like a kid again. I have never had regular food there but if it is a sweet treat you're looking for, this is your place!"}
{"text":"This hot pink ice cream parlor is a savior in the 90* weather. After hiking Camel back mountain it was time for stroll in Downtown Scottsdale which lead us to downtown. This was a great place to stop for a quick scoop of the butter pecan ice cream. The place was packed and seemed great for lunch - especially if you were in the mood for some homestyle 50's comfort food. Service was quick and the ice cream was a great treat."}
{"text":"Oh, Sugar Bowl. I die in a sundae of cuteness.

I am looking beyond your worn pink leather seats and peeling wallpaper to see the Zoe Deschanel-like adorableness beneath. Could you use a day at the spa? Yes. What lady doesn't from time to time? I sure hope you get one soon.

My friends and I had walked around Old Town for a couple of hours and it was time for a birthday treat (yes, it was my friend's birthday!). Since I was hot from walking, I stuck with what first caught my eye: the Golden Nugget. This concoction is orange sherbet, vanilla ice cream and Sprite all whipped up. YES. It was refreshing and just enough sweet. One friend got a root beer float and the birthday girl had a brownie sundae both of which were declared delicious.

The menu seemingly has not changed since the place opened in 1959 (ham salad?) but the food ordered by our neighbors smelled good and was reminiscent of your typical diner fare.

Sugar Bowl, you need a little fixing up. I'm not saying you need to change, because gosh, you're cute. But just, you know, a little updating. A little nip and tuck, that's all. Keep it fresh. The young cynical youth will appreciate you a bit more."}
{"text":"I went to Sugar Bowl on September 11th.

2001.

No national tragedy was going to come between me and a chocolate milkshake.  A young girl enjoyed her birthday party while her parents stared out the window.  It was a bizarre experience worth sharing.

More to the point, the milkshake was good.  Tonight, my hot fudge sundae was good.  It's a very basic ice cream dish.  Hard to screw up, even harder to differentiate.

Our waitress let us know she has worked at Sugar Bowl for 40 years.  It seemed sweet, but now I wonder how she has supported herself so long this way.

The walls are a shade of faded pink.  Kind of silly, but who cares?  It's ice cream."}
{"text":"We stopped here with three adults and two birthdays girls - aged 10 and 12.  One shared a fruit plate with her dad; one ordered tea sandwiches. I had a tuna melt and grandma had a hamburger.  Food was just average; sandwiches served with potato chips.  But the root beer float for dad and cheesecake and mint chocolate chip ice cream for the birthday girls was amazing.  The waitress kindly put candles on the cheesecake and brought a lighter to our table.  The girls were thrilled.

We sat in the game room in the back.  A bit noisy and a bit worn, but the kids seemed to love it.

Our waitress was nice but staff seemed harried and sparse.

The whole place needs a really good deep cleaning.  The women's bathroom is YUCK!  Likely due to foot traffic, the floors are dirty, dirty, dirty.  UGH!  

We go here every time I'm in Scottsdale, but I just try not to look at the floors.  haha"}
{"text":"OK, this is a tough one for me...It is exactly how imagined it the first time I walked inside appearance wise. All was well until I started looking at the lunch menu and just kind of found it weird. I think it just really bugged me that they didn't have French Fries and the Burger I got was mediocre. I would give this place a 5 star rating for sure if all they served was dessert, but that's just not the case. Desserts are awesome, every single one of them!!! Overall, not that impressed at all but you have to appreciate that \"old fashioned diner\" feel!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my ice cream at the sugar bowl. Had peanut butter cup and cookies and cream. Serving size were generous, Ice cream was flavorful and creamy. Love the ambience. Sugar bowl is truly a Scottsdale staple."}
{"text":"Have been here several times when in town but never once ordered anything but ice cream.  It's a generous portion of ice cream that is totally customize-able and there are plenty of options for sundaes!  
   The ambiance is a bit run down but kitschy and cute - love the pink!  It's kind of a bummer that you have to wait in such a long line to pay your bill.  Not sure why the servers can't just cash you out at the table...

Afterwards we took our kiddo to the back game room area and she had lots of fun on a vintage coin operated horse ride.  So that was neat!  $.50 a ride.  Don't think I need to come back here but it's a cute/fun experience if you've never been."}
{"text":"Ok, apparently I am one of the few people who doesn't find Family Circus creepy. But even if it did, it wouldn't stop me from coming here. 

The portions here are big enough to share, especially if you stop by for an after dinner treat. And they have so many things to choose from and everything is so good. The atmosphere is bright and this place is usually loud and crowded. It's definitely worth a stop and it's in a great location in Old Town. 

Perfect way to end the night after taking a stroll at the Scottsdale Art Walk on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"We have been driving past this place for 30 years. Tonight we stoped in after dinner. Place was hopping tonight, but we were seated quickly and the service was great. Our order, was prepared on super speedy fashion and we were on our way. Had a great time."}
{"text":"Super yummy ice cream! Have been 2 nights in a row, could come every night! Decently priced, cute and clean. Fun for the entire family! (:"}
{"text":"If you're in need of a sugar rush, than stop here! Love this old fashion ice cream parlor.  Several ice cream flavors to choose from. Staff are all young, high school/college people, but they are fun and polite. There is a separate game room for the children."}
{"text":"This place is just a big tourist trap.  I stopped in here, while puttering around Old Town.
No one greeted me when I came in, so I sat down 
at the counter on a stool.  Some \"stoner\" looking young guy finally waited on me, acted like he was off in his own planet somewhere.  No friendly greeting, just said \"Are you like ready to like order
something?\".   I ordered a mocha flavored malt, which was good, but a little too rich.  It disagreed with me, and I had a bit of an upset stomach, a few 
hours after consuming it.  Honestly, I've had better
malts from Dairy Queen.  At least the service is better there!"}
{"text":"Delicious homemade ice cream in a very cool old fashioned soda fountain shop. I sat at the pink counter on one of the cute pink stools."}
{"text":"This is a place that you must bring an out of town guest to, and if you really want to be creative with how to propose marriage this would be a good place to, heck it's good for any occasions other than break-ups and affair confessions. 

It's a throwback to the 50s soda parlor, it's so old school, and quite cute! Everything's pink, that it almost feels like Barbie is the owner of the store and she just wanted everyone to know pink is the color of the ultimate diva! Their's a soda bar and booths, and tables and chairs, and it's a great family friendly atmosphere. During the days it attracts families and in the evening, couples, teens, and kids at heart! I like their changing flavors of the month board where you can take out either a pint of quart of their hand packed ice cream!

They offer shakes, floats, splits, and cones/bowls of ice cream! love it! And during the day there's also a food menu limited to sandwiches. One thing you'll notice when seated are the many frames of Family Circle comics. Bil Keane the comic strip writer is a big fan of Sugar Bowl and alot of his comics mention the place, so it's pretty cool a comic strip celebrates the awesomeness of this old town landmark. 

These are my favorites, the top hat sundae, the buster brownie, the Desireme (D-Sire-Me) Banana Split and the 23 skiddoo!! Love them all and if I have no plans to go out, I'm willing to trek out from my place in Chandler to Old Town to pick up some ice cream and some quarts to go! It's laid back and chill... hence I've come back ever since I first went here back in 2005. Oh and the proposal thing happened to a friend of mine, her husband proposed to her at one of the booths... I think it was the 23 skiddoo!!"}
{"text":"Nice Atmosphere, Normal Sundaes

The Sugar Bowl is a Scottsdale institution.  The ice cream sundaes were good, but nothing spectacular.  What makes the place special is the style of it, evoking your typical 1950's ice cream parlor.

Service could be a lot more efficient and it would be nice if they didn't run out of important staples.  But nice overall."}
{"text":"I love the rocky road never failed when I need a quick sugar fix!!! Cutest ice cream parlor, the only old fashion style one I've seen in a while."}
{"text":"Ice cream was basic. But I have had better thrifty ice cream! The decor is cute. But the environment is super crowded and noisy. The service was beyond awful and the staff was all overall very rude !! Will never be coming back. I found nothing enjoyable this place. Amending this  to a 1. They stuffed too many people in the booth next to us my daughter basically  had a man stinking of cigarettes and coffee sitting nearly on top of her. The bathroom was filthy and smelled horribly of urine !!!"}
{"text":"If your in the mood for an old school ice cream parlor in the heart of old town Scottsdale this is the place.  I have a bit of a sweet tooth so I'm here more often than I would like to be.  It's hard to be on a diet with banana splits are right down the block!

They have a good assortment of ice creams and confections.  From floats and shakes to sundaes.  My favorite is the marshmallow topping they have which I have never seen anywhere else.  Get it!

So far I have had good service here when ordering and getting what I want every time.  The only problem is paying for the bill.  You have to walk up to the front door to pay your tab and some nights can be very busy.  I have had to wait in line to pay several times with my ice cream in hand for take out.  Hint: ice cream melts!  

I give this place 3 stars.  Minus one because they could use an update to the interior. Minus another because they could add some froyo to their menu."}
{"text":"Ah, Sunday morning... okay, Sunday afternoon.  I wake up slightly hungover with a desperate need for water and realize that I am not alone.  My best friend spent the night because she was in no shape to drive home and she is still passed out in my bed.  I nudge her and say, \"time to get up and I'm pretty sure we missed yoga.\"  We always promise each other that we will make it to the gym for a yoga class on Sunday, but we never do.  

Fast forward to us squinting into the sun as we drive up Scottsdale Road looking for something to eat.  I spot the Sugar Bowl and flashback to fond childhood memories of drinking chocolate malts in my dance uniform.  I always went here after dance recitals and that may have been why I went through this really awkward chubby stage in 4th grade.   Anyhow, my friend thought the Sugar Bowl sounded good too. 

We park our butts in a seat and order broccoli cheese soup, of course I got the aforementioned chocolate malt too.  The soup was seriously good.  It was creamy and satisfying.  The chocolate malt was as good as I remembered.  They don't exactly compliment each other though, so maybe next time I will go with the tea sandwiches."}
{"text":"service was very fast. i got the vanilla shake in the fudge lined jar. my boyfriend got the banana split forgot what they called it but it was the closest to a classic banana split that they had. my shake was just okay and his banana split was alright, the banana was firm but ripe and the vanilla ice cream was pretty good. the chicolate ice cream was not though. 4 stars for great and prompt service as well as thw decor....pink everywhere! but as far as ice cream and shake, ive had better than the sugar bowl. may have to give it another go in the futureto taste something different to change my tune."}
{"text":"This is just classic Old Town...  The quality of ice cream and toppings you get are great.  The prices are just about right too.  The service could be better.  But overall, I've always loved my experiences at the Sugar Bowl."}
{"text":"As a little girl, this was our go-to place when having a sleepover! EVERY single dessert on their menu (and this is saying a lot because their menu is HUGE!) is amazing and the atmosphere is just the cutest {think pink!}. It is a child's dream come true! 

My usual dessert of choice is a banana split, however, last night my fiance and I split the Blarney Dream Parfait {Butter pecan and vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream, and mint syrup, and we added Spanish peanuts!} and it was absolutely 'dreamy'. I even asked for a banana on the side and they brought it, no questions asked. The service is always friendly!

If you are looking to 'wow' out-of-town guests, friends, date, or your children with a yummy sweet treat, bring them here! Everyone will leave with the biggest smile on their face. They even have games for the kiddos in their back room! See you soon, Sugar Bowl!"}
{"text":"I'm one of those people who is nostalgic for a time I never existed in. When I think about my mom's teenage years of poodle skirts and soda jerks and sock hop, I look down at my smartphone and wonder if I would trade it for that sometimes.

So when my family took me to the Sugar Bowl on a recent visit to Arizona, I got my taste of nostalgia, however fleeting. This little ice cream parlor has been a staple of Scottsdale for several decades, and you can tell from walking in here that this place has been well-loved and cared for since it's opening.

All the ice cream is made by the parlor so everything is fresh, delicious, and (like the 50's) wholesome. Each us ordered a different sundae and made rotational swaps around the table so everyone could enjoy something different.

Waist be damned, I love this place and will insist on a return trip the next time I come to visit."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. Took my daughter at night for some special time. It was a hit. All old time tasteful pink decor. We shared a DELUXE burger with cheese, then a banana split. YUM! Food wasn't amazing or anything. But it just a fun thing to do. There were teens at a table celebrating a girls birthday and then a table with college students with parents. It was nice to see all ages there enjoying the night."}
{"text":"Scrumptious treats for the late night palate. Delight your taste buds after partaking in Scottsdale nightlife. This is the refueling hangover prevention palace.

Late at night it's run by a ton of highly motivated you g people who all seem to love their job.

Start with the handmade limeade."}
{"text":"A step back in time to a more innocent era reminiscent of ice cream parlors, soda jerks, luncheonettes, ice cream parlor emporiums. This legendary Scottsdale landmark serves a variety of things to eat but its fame rests in its atmosphere, a candy colored vision, its ice cream sodas with a little extra pitcher of seltzer to add when you're getting low on soda, its friendly service and the experience of going there, which is unique. Adults feel like kids and kids feel like they stepped into a magical world. A must visit when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Cute ice cream parlor with Family Circus paraphernalia on the walls and tables. The ice cream sundaes are HUGE!! The ice cream scoop is the size of a softball. Our waitress made a mistake on our order and gave us a FREE sundae! How awesome!"}
{"text":"Really glad this place opened up in Willoughby! Got takeout pho and bubble tea tonight. It was good, and the order was ready quickly. They let you customize the tea with flavor, sweetness, and add-ins. Pho portion is decently large, too. I plan on coming back frequently."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed at this place because I heard great things about it and my experience was bad, 
It is super full! And smells really bad 
The only cute thing about it are their pink seats"}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in for dessert, just a quick cone that we shared but it was truly unforgettable. We were lucky enough to have seen pumpkin pie listed on their flavor menu so that stopped me dead in my tracks. It was waaaaaay better than I could have imagined, mouthfuls of fresh pumpkin pie! Crust wasn't too sweet, ice cream wasn't overly creamy.... it was truly perfection. I'm going to call in tomorrow and find out if there's anyway to have a gallon of it shipped to CA???"}
{"text":"I really wish the sugar bowl would re-vamp. I haven't been in a long time but the few times I have tried it I haven't been happy and have had no desire to go back. in fact when ppl suggest it i say \"EW!\".

 The sundaes are overpriced and the servers take so long to bring them out that your ice cream is melted by the time you get it. so it just turns into a warm, melty mess. it's so expensive for an unappetizing sundae. i say stick to dairy queen over this place and if you're feelin like an upgrade just go to sweet republic."}
{"text":"Sugar Bowl is one of my FAVORITE dessert restaurants! I love the old fashion feel inside with the light pink and the furniture. I hope it always stays like this. The many times I have been to Sugar Bowl has always been with my family and it is a great spot for us to enjoy time together. The last time I was here I got the Dusty Road Sundae (the sundae in the middle on the picture attached)! It was so delicious and exactly what I needed!! I am not too sure what my family got... Doesn't it look so good though!?"}
{"text":"It was super hot outside after waking in old town for so long that we needed a frozen dessert to cool us down!   This spot has plenty of frozen treats to choose from.  I ended up trying the brownie sundae which was absolutely delicious.  I just wish the brownie was warmed up.  I was also a bit hungry so I had the hot dog which was probably one of the best hot dogs I've ever had!  Haha. Overall great spot and great customer service."}
{"text":"Okay, you know what's cute? A group of wholesome-looking teens dressed in soda counter garb and serving all-American treats to overheated tourists and locals alike.....that's cute! This place has a bit of that \"throw-back\" feel with the soda fountain options that you just don't see very much anymore. I had the Gold Rush, which consisted of orange sherbet, vanilla ice cream, and Sprite all blended into a 50/50 bar-esque sippable yumminess. My son really enjoyed his chocolate shake but wished there was 3 times more of it (teens...can't live with 'em, can't ever fill 'em up!) The establishment was clean and quirky and, frankly, over-staffed for that time of day...but, hey! better than the alternative, which happens all too often in this tourist town! 
If you're so inclined, the PHX Big Entertainment Book has a BOGO coupon for any menu item at the Sugar Bowl :)"}
{"text":"My kids loved the ice cream sundaes and banana splits here. Decor is a bit old, if you can get past the old pink booths it's a must stop it you are Old Town for some ice cream."}
{"text":"Love the Sugar Bowl - not many old-fashioned ice cream parlors left!
Hadn't been in a while - just as good as always.  (and boy, were they busy tonight!)  My great nephews got a scoop of ice cream each (vanilla with sprinkles for one, and chocolate for the other), and my niece and nephew split a build-your-own banana split.  I got the Rocky Road, but substituted almonds for walnuts - worked really nicely.  Good ice cream, and a fun arcade in the back.
Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Been dying for a legit Pho place to come closer to us in Willoughby instead of hauling all the way to CLE.  I had the Pho with steak today for lunch and it was amazing.  Can't wait to try their Sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"Food: The ice cream was good but the brownie, I have to say that was the best part of the whole sundae.  I was pleasantly surprised too that the burger was flavorful and perfectly cooked. To be honest I was anticipating a crummy burger considering they are known for their ice cream.

Location: I feel that the location of the Sugar Bowl is the main draw. The Sugar Bowl is located in downtown Scottsdale which thrives on tourist. This is one of the oldest buildings in old town and is super cute, perfect for dates!

Service: The service was friendly and I was delighted that the server was enthusiastic and pleased to be at work."}
{"text":"What an adorable spot!  The pink and white color scheme and cozy booths made me feel so 1950s, I wanted to throw on a poodle skirt!  We stopped in on a Sunday evening around 8pm and the place was packed.  Luckily we didn't have to wait but five minutes for a table.  We split a burger and each ordered a dessert.  The burger came with chips and coleslaw, all of which were subpar.  Our ice cream desserts however, made up for the burger and sides.  Skip the dinner options and splurge on the ice cream options instead!"}
{"text":"If you are in Arizona, whether you are a native or a tourist, you must try this at least once.  Their ice cream is legendary and for good reason it has been around for over 50 years.  It is very tasty, rich, creamy and down right yummmy . It was a bit of a wait, after all it was a gorgeous spring Sunday afternoon.  I have tried their sandwiches which are good, but you must come for the ice cream."}
{"text":"The waitress at the Salty Se√±orita recommended this places to us because it was right down the street. It seemed fun until I overpaid for an okay hot fudge sundae. It was delicious but not worth the money. Next time, I'll make myself one at home."}
{"text":"If you want a classic dessert shop this is your place. The sugar bowl is yummy and aborable. The desserts are classic ice cream shop desserts and the food is classic diner food. The inside is adorable it looks like granny's house. I usually get a classic banana split and im never disappointed. I've had their cheese burger too and it was pretty good. This is one of the few places in Scottsdale that i actually like to eat at."}
{"text":"Of course everyone loves an old fashioned ice-cream parlor and this is exactly that.  However, since they expanded to have an arcade for the little ones, it really should be updated and cleaned up.  I don't understand why it's so pathetic and shabby.  You know people are chugging tokens like crazy in there when they have kids with them."}
{"text":"Great experience. Brought my Aunt here who was visiting. She thoroughly enjoyed it.  Her hot fudge Sunday was out of this world.  Root beer floats are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Second visit .. Rueben grilled and milk shake ... very good . Service s slow like pointed out by others ..

Ambience is good but needs little touch up ..."}
{"text":"Fun little 60's diner full of diabetes inducing deliciousness. I got the shake- good! My friends got the brownie, coffee ice cream with nuts, and a malt. Fun family
Friendly environment."}
{"text":"I was surprised at the prices - you can get a sundae for 5 bucks!  Nowadays it seems like a milkshake costs you that much..  The items seem VERY sweet however, I guess they don't call it sugar bowl for nothing.  I think I will ask them to go easy on the fudge and get nuts or something to balance out the flavor.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"this place is so pink! and cute. we shared the spectacular banana bowl but subbed turkish coffee ice cream for vanilla.  YUM. the ice creams were all pretty good (turkish coffee was by far my favorite) and the toppings were pretty standard.  i loved the addition of the spanish peanuts.  and considering how big the sundae was, it was super cheap!"}
{"text":"Pink, pink, pink!

Old-timey, old-timey, old-timey!

Ice cream, ice cream, ice cream!

I'm not sure you really need any more information than that, but I'll endeavor to perhaps fill in a few details.

So, this is indeed an adorable little ice cream parlor in Old Town Scottsdale. It's old school, and not retro. Sure, they're still printing up the elaborate napkins and working that old font pretty hard, but it's not some new place that opened up with a polished, old-time feel. No, it's an old place that's keeping the feeling alive.

That said, it probably could use some polishing. They have main parlor that's about as adorable as you could hope, but I did feel like the whole thing could have used a good scrubbing. There's also a back room for the kiddos with token-fed games like skee-ball and air hockey. They're not the newest, nor in the best condition, but the kids do love them. And they spit out tickets that you can trade in for trinkets.

The food is basic. I split a burger and they were so kind to actually split the burger and give us a generous portion of potato chips and two pickles. In fact, the staff was so very very sweet the entire time. Not \"slick and polished\" but \"sweet and really trying.\" The burger? Well, also pretty basic. But don't come here for the food, I think. It's more about the ice cream.

We tried a few kinds, and it's also old school. Nothing organic, or locally sourced, or herb-infused. Nosireee, this is old school, hand-scooped, basic flavors with chocolate and caramel on top. There are lots of options, or you can build your own concoction. It's simple, basic, felt kind of expensive (but somebody's gotta pay that lease and print those napkins) and I can't complain.

Come by with the kids, or pop in for a treat. It's not novel, but these days something this genuinely old school is a novelty."}
{"text":"Wow what a lovely place. Great menu. Cute decor. Service is great. The ice cream was delicious. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Old School!  If you order a single scoop it's really cheap. Real ice cream versus the frozen yogurt soft serve. Waitstaff attentive. You pay at the door when you are done. Even the bathroom is old school (aka small and cramped). Location is great. Went there on a weekday night in February and the place was 80% full."}
{"text":"A classic Scottsdale staple.  Nothing has changed in decades and I love it that way."}
{"text":"I've been waiting YEARS for Pho to come to Willoughby!! This place does not disappoint and I will be a frequent customer."}
{"text":"I came here after driving by and seeing the cute decor outside. It was after dinner & I wasn't super hungry but had thought it was a quick ice cream spot.

Boy, was I wrong!

We were seated and I loved all the pink decor. It definitely felt like a 50's ice cream parlor. 

They had plenty of menu items & I decided to go with a brownie ala mode with a scoop with chocolate chip. 

A little disappointed as they were out of Cookies & Cream and Chocolate Chip Mint (two of my faves). Not sure if they had a sudden rush of orders on those flavors or just didn't have enough in stock. 

Friendly staff and everyone seemed like a local who came there often."}
{"text":"Fun place to celebrate birthday parties! 

They have a small kids area similar to Chuck & Cheese, the only thing is that the waiters spend more time on the other side of the business and it's annoying to have to call them every time you need something.

The ice cream it's really good and the place gets really busy."}
{"text":"I give Sugar Bowl a thumbs up for its ambiance. It is a fun place to take my daughter. It is always a special treat to go to and eat nothing but ice cream. But, the first time we went into Sugar Bowl we sat at the bar and ordered sundaes. When the \"bartender\" was scooping the ice cream we noticed it was store bought and we were disappointed. 

The prices are fairly reasonable, but considering that they don't make their own ice cream, I would consider it pricey for store bought. 

They have an arcade style room in the back with games. The kids enjoy that. It is a fun place to go on a Saturday afternoon. Especially when it is hot outside and the kids are tired of going to the movies."}
{"text":"My daughter had a event in OldTown Scottsdale.  I had went pass this place a few before weekends before, but had not had the opportunity to go inside.  WOW! ( Once again I had a BOGO coupon.) This place is so cute!  Absolutely Adorable!!  It is pink and white.  Just like on old fashioned ice cream shop. The creator of the comic strip Family Circus, Bil Keane used to go there and made several comic strips about the place.They have them hanging around the place and on the menu.   Food was GREAT.  I had a Reuben sandwich, they serve it with mustard unless you ask for dressing, and it was YUMMY!  My daughter had a Meatloaf sandwich, she LOVED it!  We shared the Do-it-yourself banana split.  We had a nice girls lunch. :)"}
{"text":"I'm a tourist, and I couldn't figure out if it was purposely made to look old, or if it actually is. Regardless, I though it was a super cute place where you can actually sit inside and just have an ice cream or a shake and not be rushed out. I felt like I was in a back to the future movie. I ordered a scoop of ice cream for my son, and it was super creamy. My husband had a pineapple and mint shake and he liked, although I didn't try because I just don't like how the combination sounded. The staff is super nice and fast. The food I can't attest for, as I didn't have and quite honestly there are so many fusion restaurants around, I really wouldn't have wanted a split pea soup. The food portion seemed like diner food, which would be fine be if that's what you're in the mood for but I wasn't."}
{"text":"First time in Arizona visiting and I decided to enjoy a sundae at the Sugar Bowl. I tried the top hat sundae and it was delicious! It consisted of a cream puff with the cream and vanilla ice cream in the middle with chocolate syrup on top. Service was great, place reminded me of an old fashioned cute little diner inside. Definitely would visit again!"}
{"text":"Really cute place for dessert.  Excellent ice cream! I wish they had more pies or other dessert on the menu.  Definitely worth trying out if you're visiting Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Very cute place to go to in Old Town. When you first hear about it you think it's just mostly ice cream but I was surprised to see they had some food there. The prices are reasonable. 

I got the Bacon Burger which was $9.50 and it came with the burger, potato chips instead of French fries, and a pickle. I thought it was interesting that they didn't serve you the regular French fries on the side but it was okay I liked the chips. It was a decent size burger too so that was good. My friend and I shared the Desireme Banana Split. That was $6.95 and that was good enough for both of us. It had strawberry and vanilla ice cream scoop on top of a banana with chocolate sauce drizzle and whip cream on top and a cherry to top it off. It was very tasty. I can tell the ice cream was rich. 

The place itself is super cute. The place is mostly pink and has an all American 70s vibe to it like Johnny Rockets. People can have some adorable pics here to post on IG. The outside has a couple pink walls and vintage windows to give people a good back drop. There's plenty of seating with an additional back room with more seats and a couple of arcade games for kids. However the store is very narrow and small. Only one bathroom for women and men. So it got crowded to walk through and wait for the bathroom. 

Other than that I liked it and would love to take my friends here next time."}
{"text":"Everything was fine until we saw a cockroach roaming around the shelves behind the counter where we were sitting.   When we finished we were sitting there for awhile before one of the staff finally brought us our check.  I wanted to get change for a tip, but there was nobody at the cashier and none of the workers bothered to acknowledge us.  During this time (and it was NOT busy) several workers were just standing around talking.  When one of them walked by with his face buried in his phone, I'd had enough.  Left a .50 cent tip that was frankly too much for the lousy service, but we'd have been there another 20 minutes just to get our change.  

The cool, old-fashioned ice cream parlor we were hoping for was in actuality a dirty dump with bush league service.  Derp."}
{"text":"My friend and I are in from out of town and walked in, excited to try some ice cream. Although there were multiple staff who weren't busy, they stared at us blankly. The front counter was all seated and we went to order, but nobody would help us. They just stared at us and didn't say a word. A server offered us a table, but the moment we sat down and she realized we wanted to get ice cream to go, she snatched the menus from our hands and told us \"we had to go to the front counter\" to be served. We went and stood there again, and got blank stares from the four servers behind the counter that weren't busy, stayed there for a couple minutes and finally just left. Weirdest experience. Staff needs to be trained to help customers appropriately."}
{"text":"Sooooooo pinkin' cute! Yes, pinkin'.

What a blast from the past! Feels like you're right in the heart of the 1950's! Such a kick to enjoy a cute lil diner for a milkshake and basket of fries!"}
{"text":"I grew up having ice cream here. I'm happy when I come home to Scottsdale and my kids want to take grandma here. My, how the tables have turned. It's just the same as it was when I was a kid even more busy. It's a great place for kids and families to have an ice cream or meal and create some memories."}
{"text":"Came here for a pit stop before heading out, the portion size is a good amount. Definitely worth sharing with each other and the milkshake was very tasty and filling. The place is cute and very old school looking. They even have a arcade inside that is about half of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came in with my dad during one sweltering August night, lured in by the cute 50's ambience and by the nostalgia of going to the Sugar Bowl as a kid.  The people who worked there were simply rude, barely acknowledging our presence.  When we ordered I saw that he scooped out of a container that said Dreyer's. If a sundae could be bland, this was. I know a lot of places used mass-produced ice cream, but I would go to Sweet Republic in a heartbeat over this place."}
{"text":"I am a Pho fan, and ecstatic that a place opened closer to where I live.  I have to be honest, Superior Pho is my favorite, with Pho Thang running a close second.  Sugar Bowl, however was pretty tasty.  I ventured in on a Friday night, greeted warmly by the counter-person.  I am not a huge fan of ordering at the counter and then being seated, but the process was easy enough.  I ordered Pho Tai and spring rolls, and then found a counter seat in front of the window.  The spring rolls arrived a short time later, nothing extraordinary.  Order of 4 cooked to order ($4.95).  I would suggest offering a 1/2 order for those dining alone.  The Pho took a bit longer than I would have expected, medium bowl, lots of noodles, decent amount of broth.  I added thai basil, jalapenos, beans sprouts, hoisin and sriracha, and the soup was still a bit bland.  I added a bit more hoisin and sriracha, which improved the taste.  The serving was generous and the soup was piping hot.  I truly enjoyed my soup, once seasoned to my liking.  The only downside for me, was the seating was not that comfortable, but that wouldn't stop me from returning.....soon."}
{"text":"\"Gosh-Awful-Gooey Banana Split: fresh banana split lengthwise, Turkish coffee ice cream blanketed with caramel sauce, red raspberry sorbet smothered in marshmallow sauce with delicious whip and a juicy maraschino cherry atop.\" Heaven!!"}
{"text":"A must if you're in Scottsdale. It's the ultimate sweet-tooth killer. Their Reuben is also really, REALLY good."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is for one of those days that I want to eat and eat and eat ice cream. It is almost impossible to stop eating them."}
{"text":"This is a charming classic American diner. We went to get ice cream and sat at the bar. The soda jerks worked furiously and enthusiastically to serve customers. Unfortunately, other members of the staff were none too interested in their jobs, including the ones who stood around chatting and ignored me at the register as I waited to pay. it's nothing fancy, but a decent place to stop for a classic feel and traditional scoop of ice cream. Based on the staff attitude outside of those at the bar, I suspect the table dining experience would not be as pleasant."}
{"text":"After a long, stressful day, I was craving a hot fudge sundae after dinner with real ice cream (not dairy queen). I live down the street from the Sugar Bowl so that is where I headed. I need that little pick me up and smile that ice creams brings me. Apparently, I went to the wrong place. They were out of whipped cream....you can't have a hot fudge sundae without whipped cream!! I had to ask for nuts and then when I went to pay at the cashier cage the guy NEVER looked at me, said anything to me and NEVER even thanked me. What is going on???? Talk about ruining my evening! Maybe I went with my hopes to high, but is it too much to ask for a thank you?? I paid almost $7 for a sundae with no whip cream, no smile and a big bowl of irritation. THANKS!"}
{"text":"Great old fashioned ice cream parlor!

They have a ton of toppings to create your own or special unique creations. It's a fun place and we had good service. Ice cream was great too. 

It will definitely be a stop of mine next year during spring training."}
{"text":"This place is an institution in Old Town Scottsdale!  We stopped in to get some ice cream to go and it was great...high quality, reasonable prices and friendly staff.  The wait was a little long, but it was definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful little throw back!  Had seen the place in Family Circus cartoons and it was neat to go in and have ice cream.  Great menu with a lot of different things (not just ice cream).  Super pleasant staff and a cute atmosphere made this place a winner.  Left without finishing my ice cream and stuffed after we had lunch elsewhere.  It was an old fashioned ice cream parlor and was a pleasure."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a sweet, maybe one with some chocolate or even a big sundae - this is your place. Nice old-fashioned ice cream shop located in old town. This place still has the retro pink vibe and decoration going on inside. 

My friend and I came here when we were looking to splurge with the buster brownie sundae. BOY is It sweet but worth it! Sugar Bowl also serves food, which I was unaware of but probably wouldn't order. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Okay... so little back story: When my daughter was a bit younger (3-5 years), she would come here and have an emotional break down..... everytime. Maybe it was the sugar, maybe it was too much pink paint for her senses, or maybe it was bad timing.

Now that she is older, now 10 years old, we have no issues wtth the place. Great prices, great food and classic service that is hard to find at more trendy locations.

Cons:
The check out system
Needs a little updating.... not a lot... just fresh paint and new furniture"}
{"text":"Super flipping cute AUTHENTIC ice cream parlor! Went here after dinner with some friends visiting town and we all had so much fun hanging out in the parlor. The staff was kind and it just brought you back to the good ol days of fun experiences. The mint chocolate chip was awesome and everyone who had the Rockyroad loved it too!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you are looking for something sweet and are in Scottsdale. I had the tin roof sundae and it was out of this world. I love sweet and salty together. Sugar Bowl is also open late so its a great place to go if you are hungry or drunk or have the muchies and need something good to eat. The service, however, is a little slow and I would never dream of going during normal hours (I have been late at night) with the amount of kids that are probably there!"}
{"text":"This place could be great, maybe even a top 10 \"must stop for kids\" in a what to do while in Old Town, or even Phoenix/Scottsdale . However, they have a way to go before they even make the top 50 list. There is a really bad smell as soon as you walk inside the door. The restrooms and general areas are not clean.  The food is average at best. I had the chili with cheese and onion. They gave me a \"slice\" of cheddar, it was strange, and the chili was 90%beans, no flavor. It's such a shame. The decor, if clean would be on spot. The theme is so cute, down to the menu. They need to shut down for a weekend, hire a professional chef to revamp the menu and clean the place from top to bottom.  So close, but yet so far!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was 11pm on Friday and I was craving for a creamy frozen treat instead of my usual craving for tangy tart froyo. Since Sweet Republic was closed, I decided to try Sugar Bowl. I went for a simple scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was just okay. The flavor was fine but there was lots of little round ice particles I kept feeling in my mouth. Probably could've went to the local grocery market and picked up a tub of Blue Bell and got the same, if not better."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that has not changed since I moved here over a decade and a half ago.  There is nothing like it anywhere in the valley.  Please, Sugar Bowl, do not modernize your place!  The sugar pink and chrome 50's decor sets you apart from all the other places.  It is like stepping back in time...well before my time, but I imagine that this is how it would be.  My friends and I used to come here way before we all had  out own families.  Now, we meet up here and bring the whole gang!   My all time favorite is the Top Hat.  They take a warm cream puff and fill it with your choice of ice cream (vanilla for me) and drizzle gooey hot fudge that spills over the sundae glass!  My DH fave is vanilla ice cream with the same hot fudge and topped with spanish peanuts that they call Tin Roof.  My son knows what he wants so he instructs the server to scoop cookies and cream add the banana and top it with the same hot fudge with cherry on top. He is bouncing off the walls!  Thank goodnes for the arcade game section!!! We've never had any of their lunch or dinner menu, so this review is purely for the dessert!"}
{"text":"We drove past at least five other ice cream places to get here with an out of town friend to have sundaes. When we received our sundaes they were sans whipped cream. When we asked about it they said \"oh, sorry we are out of whipped cream.\" WTF sugar bowl?! Poor form."}
{"text":"People are nice, great service and atmosphere. Walking in you get the expectation that you are in for a treat - a real old-time family ice cream parlor. And when I am looking for that kind of experience my 'bar' is pretty high, Romolo's in San Mateo California and Birdsall's in Mason City Iowa are great examples. Which is where Sugar Bowl fell down a little bit...

The ice cream itself was average. Just average. I spoke to one of the young and very pleasant employees before leaving and he confirmed that this is factory-made ice cream albeit a 'restaurant blend' made with heavy cream. As an example, the other places I mentioned still make their own ice cream. Homemade or small batch ice cream (like homemade pasta) is a treat that stands out. If Sugar Bowl stepped up their game a little with the ice cream I would push Yelp to add a sixth star for a rating...

But don't let my fit of ice cream snobbery stop you from going, I recommend the experience. Hard to beat even average ice cream served with the care and atmosphere found in Sugar Bowl."}
{"text":"The facility is pink as hell,  I mean.. pink.  Everything is pink.    It will blow your frickin mind. 

Also they use a staggering number of adjectives in the menu.     

The treats are of course the star of the show and they shine - and if  you get anything that says \"swimming\" in marshmallow creme, rest assured they deliver on that promise.   

So.. um..  I'm just gonna' say this:  I like Mary Coyle's better.     But Sugar Bowl is good too."}
{"text":"My experience was very mixed. The food was really good. The ice cream is creamy but the prices are ridiculous.  There is no children's menu so we ordered my daughter 2 hot dogs. I asked for no bun and no chips and she said i will have to charge you and I said that is fine. I got the bill and they charged me $11.00 for 2 hot dogs. Are you kidding me? I said something at the cashier and no response. Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everytime we are in Scottsdale we always make a trip here:) always great customer service and yummy ice cream!"}
{"text":"Hot Fudge Sundae was great. Service was good and a cool little place to satisfy any sweet tooth."}
{"text":"I've been to Old Town a thousand times but only went here recently expecting a gem.  Ordered a hot fudge sundae with almonds.  Never going back.

This place has a lot of charm but who serves raw nuts on a sundae?!  Toast your almonds people.  Totally not worth it, slow service and sloooooooooow cashier (you have to pay at a separate station).  I"}
{"text":"My favorite (sentimental) ice cream spot in all of Arizona! 

$4.95 for two big scoops of ice cream, chocolate sauce, malt crumbs, whipped cream, and a cherry? The Dusty Road Sundae is terrrrrific. The average sundae is $6.50, but that's a steal compared to other places.

They have about 10 traditional-ish ice cream flavors, the prices are reasonable, the storefront is classic, the interior is huge with comfy booths, and there is a small-ish arcade in the back. Only a 10-minute walk from Scottsdale Stadium into Old Town Scottsdale.

If you're reviewing this place based on the food, you're missing the entire point of the Sugar Bowl. It's a 1950s ice cream parlor, not a modern ice cream store with fancy new flavors."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Just terrible. Just wanted some ice cream and took forever to be seated. No organized line to order at the counter and the hostess was rude. We ended up just leaving with out even ordering. Wasted 20 min. Never going back. Ice cream is not worth that hassle."}

{"text":"Came in with my kids on Saturday lunch, wasn't too busy.  This is a classic ice cream parlor with counter and table service.

We focused on the ice-creams, so cannot comment on the rest of the menu.  Each kid had a banana split, ice cream is good quality with a wide mix of topping.  Kids loved it, and could not finish what they had.

Place is clean and service was very attentive

I will be back with the kids and would recommend to others!"}
{"text":"If this place were to have opened up last week it would probably last 6 months.  But it has generations of history and patronage on its side so it will remain a Scottsdale icon.  The ice cream is decent but the real draw is the nostalgia and feeling of family."}
{"text":"Great food love the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Staff very friendly. One of my most favorite restaurants highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is Always a place my daughter wants to visit when she comes to Arizona! We love ice cream so it's only fitting that we enjoy a classic soda fountain treat at the historic Sugar Bowl!! It's a sweet nostalgic blast in time to enjoy an ice cream concoction at the bar! I love to concoct my own sundae or get something off the menu!!"}
{"text":"The Ice cream sundaes were delicious. The Hot fudge was the best I ever had..Will return when I visit Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"If you paint a building Pepto Bismal pink and print the words \"Sugar Bowl\" in large letters on the side of it, I'll probably wind up there. I heart an old fashioned ice cream parlor and so it was my destiny to try this place while in Scottsdale. The Sugar Bowl has sit-down service with diner food, but we just grabbed sweet treats from the counter to go. 

It's very ... pink ... on the inside as well. I'm no girly-girl, but I could get down with this in some contexts--even this context--but the modern updates to the d√©cor made it come off a bit too much like a little girl's bedroom for my taste. Still, they do maintain some of the classic soda fountain features and they serve ice cream so it's definitely not a torturous place to be. I sampled the root beer float and Turkish coffee milkshake. Both were good, but not exceptional; the quality of the root beer and ice cream was average. If your sweet compartment is especially large, though, their sundaes and other fancy ice cream concoctions did sound enticing."}
{"text":"The ice cream is GREAT! 
The staff is SHITTTTTT! 
As soon as we walked in we were met by multiple glares from the staff for no apparent reason. I honestly think there's massive drama going on behind the scenes. 
We were not waited untill we asked for a waitress. We saw our icecreams just sitting on a serving tray for 20 MINUTES. By the time we got our icecream it was half melted. 
This place needs a new manager or SOMETHING. Everyone who works there clearly hates their job."}
{"text":"This place is such a Scottsdale institution!  When I think of Old Town, I think of wagon wheel benches, Western hat/boot/jewlery shops and the Sugar Bowl!

The ice cream is quite delicious and will win new fans among any who taste it!  I love the sundaes, the shakes, the banana splits - everything is absolutely scrumptious!!  Oh, and get hot fudge...trust me!!  I have yet to try anything besides the dessert (their ice cream is the good stuff- you'll need lots of room!).

This place is a little piece of history - over 50 years and going strong - but they're not getting by on reputation alone.  The service is pleasant, the place is adorable (think pink and classic, a touch shabby), and every single out-of-town guest and in-town friend I've brought here has loved it!  

TIP: If you brought a kid (or you are a kid), check out the little arcade in the back to work off a little ice cream energry - ski ball, basketball, etc :-)"}
{"text":"For being a quaint, old fashioned, mom and pop ice cream parlor, I give The Sugar Bowl about 3 stars. In this age of Baskin Robbins and Cold Stone, it's nice to see a real ice cream parlor with two full menu pages dedicated to delicious ice cream creations. Thats about the best I can say about the place tho.

The general decor is old and run down, the attentiveness of the wait staff is mediocre at best, and the place just has a generally dirty feel to it. It is fairly clean in actuality, but has that musty pine-sol and windex smell throughout that makes it completely unappetizing. They advertise their \"Family Circus\" history all over the place, but that is hardly enough to sustain a restaurant like this.

My real frustration however,  is the \"Game Room\", which at first glace appears to be their miniaturized immitation of Chuck E. Cheese, only it falls way short. The change machine that is supposed to dispense 4 tokens for $1, regularly gives only 3 tokens per dollar. Games that only cost 1 token at CEC cost as much as 4 tokens here, but quite regularly you will put a token in and not get credit for it, so they wind up costing even more. The \"Candy Claw\" game that *used* to be \"Play til you win\" is now two tokens for one try, whether you win or not, and the claw doesn't even close until it's halfway back up to the top of the machine!! Oh, and if you feel the need to complain to someone, you'll have to walk back into the restaurant to find someone, because there is never anyone in the game room to help you. When someone finally does come in to help you, they'll put on their well-rehearsed perplexed look and say \"Hmm, it's never done that before\"... except my 4 year old and I experience these exact same problems every time we go in. 

Tonight however, was the final straw. I'm tired of being ripped off by these people. The ice cream is great, the food is mediocre for what they charge, the water tastes like filtered sewer water, and the staff looks like they wished they worked at Wal Mart. The game room is a waste of time, energy and money. The owners obviously know about these problems and have no intention of fixing them, as there is no way to contact them on the Sugar Bowl website. 

They've lost my business for no other reason than they simply don't give a damn about their customers. Maybe if things change drastically for the better, I'll consider going back, but not until then."}
{"text":"The Sugar Bowl is a hidden gem in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. The place is very hard to miss, as its bright pink and colorful exterior can be seen from a mile away! This restaurant gives off the vibe of a retro pink diner, and is very fun and cozy with some great food options.

Right when you walk in, the friendly staff greets you and hands you a menu, full of many different things to eat. Although they have many breakfast, lunch, and dinner entrees, most people come for the famous deserts, specifically their ice cream. This place has all things related to dessert, from shakes and smoothies to parfaits and sundaes! The service is excellent and we received our ice cream very fast. I ordered the Buster Brownie Sundae, and I was blown away! Everything was delicious and reasonably priced; what more could you ask for?

Overall, Sugar Bowl is a great place to eat with friends and family, and is definitely a go-to spot for locals and tourists alike."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did.  I vaguely remember going here with my mother often when I was young to get ice cream and dinner and apparently I remember it being much much better.  We showed up on this hot winter day wanting some ice cream and some burgers.  We had a cranky two year old who had not eaten and had not yet had her nap.  Upon first walking in we realized it was busy as there were plenty of butts in the seats and not enough people running around taking care of them.  Understaffed? Surely not. (sarcasm, if you couldn't tell)
We gave them our name and a larger party came in behind us.  They were sat before we were and still we stood, tapping our foot with our child growing more and more unwieldly.  Finally we were taken into the play room area, yes there is a small arcade off to the side where children can obtain tickets to buy little bobbles.  Our two year old was instantly interested.  Upon being sat and handed some water both daddy and daughter were running around with a fresh dollar to find some fun.  I made sure to find out what he wanted before he left so we could order quickly.
Quickly did not come.  Daddy and daughter returned before the server showed up.  Finally, she did show and I ordered our food and some ice cream for the baby.
Food took about as long as I figured it would with a busy kitchen and many patrons.  I was not very impressed.  The food was alright and definitely not worth the price.  The ice cream was also not impressive as I have had much better at G-Spot or even Cold Stone yet it was comparable in price to these two places.
As I said, I wanted to like this place.  I was feeling nostialgic and only wanted to experience a restaurant that I used to visit with my mother with my child and her daddy and now I can say that I have and will probably never return.

In Conclusion, unless you have a good reason to check this place out, don't bother.  It's not even worth the nostalgia."}
{"text":"It's cool to swing in and see what they have. Definitely a vintage cool ice cream parlor. The ice cream was alright but nothing I'd write home about. It is a bit overpriced for the quality, but there is definitely quite a bit of ice cream they give ya so that's nice. The staff was... there. The man serving me was friendly and nice but there just seemed to be like this atmosphere of \"customer last\" feeling. Wasn't the warmest welcome in there but at the end of the day they were probably college kids stuck in a warm diner serving decent ice cream."}
{"text":"Fun place to get some ice cream. I'd go back for a couple scoops of Cookies N Cream. Old school style atmosphere is very cool, although some TLC is needed to make it a little more comfy.

{"text":"Masterfully created artisan ice creams made in small batches from only the freshest, local ingredients...you won't find that at Sugar Bowl.  If that's what you're looking for, head to Sweet Republic.  Those gals are the masters of ice cream.

But sometimes I want a simple sundae...or a Spectacular Banana Bowl in my case (chocolate ice cream with marshmallow topping, vanilla with strawberry, and cookies & cream with chocolate syrup) made with perfectly good ice cream, and all that for only $7.50.  That's when you'll find me in my own neighborhood at Sugar Bowl.

Stopping in last weekend, their power was out, but since it wasn't too warm outside, we stayed anyway.  And guess what?  The lack of an air conditioner running in the background and no fluorescent lighting was kind of appropriate for this little old school ice cream parlor.  It reminded me of a time when ice cream was just ice cream.  No vegetables or pork products involved.  No liqueurs (unless your dad was drinking a beer while you ate your sundae).  No over analyzing the texture, sweetness, creaminess.  Just ice cream.  Of course there's not a scoop for a dime to be found either, but a scoop for $1.95 is on the menu.

I also found it entertaining while my husband ran across the street to the ATM, that someone finally found the credit card imprinter, and depressing that the cashier did not know what it was or how to use it.  Times have changed."}

{"text":"Although there really are no words for how good this place is, I'm going to try! Placed in Old Scottsdale in the Old West town area, the Sugar Bowl pictures itself as an old time ice cream parlor. And with the generous portion sizes, delicious ice cream, and beyond reasonable pricing, I'm picking up what they are putting down!

I had a double scoop of mint chip that was omg good. My friends each tried the raspberry and orange sorbet and were making super inappropriate sounds for public consumption: it was that good. 

I would go out of my way any time I am in the Phoenix area to get more of that Sugar Bowl!"}

{"text":"Sugar Bowl makes for a great hot afternoon treat. Between the ice cream and arcade, you can't ask for a better day and there's no age limit to enjoy it! Yes, there is an arcade and it has ski ball, the basketball game, air hockey and some other games. You can get tokens and win tickets for a prize. It's perfect if you have children and are looking for something to do and it's even fun if you are an adult and want to relive your childhood one day."}
{"text":"Cute date night spot and very classic Americana atmosphere. It's always so dang hot in this place though. Swamp cooler maybe? It's ok because hello ice cream is there to cool you down but still would be nice to not feel gross stuffy sticky inside."}
{"text":"This is just an awesome old school ice cream type parlor which my grandparents used to take my brother and I to after spring training games. They do have a full menu, so you can actually get some food there too. 

In the back area there is kind of a Peter Piper set up with games and things for the kids. That is really what this place is for...something different for the kids. I can honestly telling you that your kids will remember you taking them here when they get older and thank you for it. I know because like I said, I remember going here when I was a kid.

Only issue is that everything is over priced, but it is downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"ICE CREAM CENTRAL! I had no idea but they have diner-type food here as well. It has such a nostalgic 50's diner feel to it and you can't help but smile when you are there. It has a variety of ice cream flavors. I love that this is the place in the comic - Family Circus. It is  definitely a well-known place in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Cute old fashioned ice cream shop. Reasonable prices.  Home made whipped cream. Ice cream is decent."}
{"text":"dairy does not agree with my belly, but sometimes i just have to \"man-up\" and \"go for it\" because \"it is what it is\".
Cece G said it best....it is highly recommended to bring a friend and order 1 thing (unless it's just a scoop). otherwise, you will be jabbing yourself multiple times with an emergency diabetes pen. the ice cream servings are huge, and i couldn't finish my 2 scoops of almond praline and rocky road. although both were equally decadent and rich and oh so tasty. 

my wife had the mint chip with hot fudge and i'm not a big fan of mint ice cream, however, upon tasting hers, it was very, very tasty. my sis-in-law bested me and finished her 2 scoops, but now she is laid out on the couch in stretchy pants.

a great place in old town...it epitomizes the vision of yesteryear when i'm sure scottsdale was a bit more romantic and innocent. i hope it stays around for many more \"50 year\" anniversaries."}
{"text":"I am very happy that this Pho restaurant opened so close to home! We've had the Pho Tai (beef), the Gyoza (fries dumplings) appetizer and the unicorn macaroons.  Everything was delicious!!  I've had pho from several other locations around Cleveland and this is amongst the best. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go to Scottsdale This Icecream spot is a must..Old fashioned Ice cream spot a cool place to duck in from the heat and you also get to check outthe family circus comic strips By artist Bill  Keane Cute..."}
{"text":"Two thumbs up! Cute, family friendly atmosphere. Perfect place to enjoy some tasty ice cream on a hot day."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were absolutely awful. I would have expected the ice cream to be good, but it had a suspiciously odd consistency. Will never ever come back to this place."}
{"text":"Great ice cream with a cool old-fashioned vibe. Only reason for a knocked down star is because I think it's a little overpriced. I paid $6.25 for a malt..... But it was definitely the most delicious caramel malt in the world."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is at the Sugar Bowl is fun. This place has become a family tradition with my wife and I. We love coming here for dessert and occasionally dinner. The food is real cheap and just a typical diner food with good sandwiches and soups. They have great Italian sodas and shakes and tons of huge banana splits and sundaes. I would recommend the Sugar Bowl to anyone. Parking can be a pain if you go on the weekend nights but worth it."}
{"text":"Sugar Bowl is THE classic Scottsdale spot for a good old fashioned ice cream.  In the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, and steeped in old west flare and Arizona history, the Sugar Bowl will always be a staple!  And you can't go wrong with any of the delicious treats!!"}
{"text":"I was in search of yet another ice cream locale for my weekly Friday night sweet fix when i discovered this establishment  as i was driving through Old Town Scottsdale. Now i had heard this was an old school ice cream parlor with a nice family atmosphere and great service. All these things i found to be true....but the ice cream was another matter all together.

I thought they made their own...but i was sadly mistaken. Now while the ice cream was not bad because i had a very delicious banana split sundae...i just want fresh made ice cream. Despite all of that it was a very decent place and i would recommend it to those who aren't picky about there ice cream...i just am. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place purely for nostalgic reasons.  It is super pink and super sweet and super cheesy.  You come here a lot on first dates (when the date doesn't involve tons of alcohol in old town scottsdale that is, and when you are longing for a simpler time). The ice cream is good.  Not super high butter fat, coat your mouth and tongue, eww this is a stick of butter ice cream, but I will say I wish things were a little less sweet.  Everything will make you diabetic.  I've never had the savory items here, I've had only the sundaes and the desserts.  You can admire all the Family Circus memorabilia hanging around and then long for a time when you are presented a bill and you don't get sticker shock.  It's not super cheap I'll warn you.  But I've been coming here for so many years I'd be heartbroken if it was gone.  Then Scottsdale will truly be dead to me."}
{"text":"Perfect stop on a hot Arizona day for brownie buster ice cream and sundaes. Chocolate is thick and flavoreful which compliments the vanilla should you choose vanilla.Prices are a little high but it is a good portion to share with 2. I would also suggest fudge or strawberry. Fudge clearly drips but does not melt as a topping.

The toppings are fresh and plenty of sweet juices that come with fruits. The creamery style of the ice cream is thick and chilled at the right temperature.

 The ora around is delightful as everyone is on a sugar high. They got games for kids and a fountain counter.

I suggest that you park off the main road to avoid less time and high probability of getting a ticket. There is no long waits because there are plenty of seats."}
{"text":"I actually really do like this place. The ice-cream is oh-so-good, the workers...eh, could be a little friendlier. But hey, it gets pretty busy there so I can understand being a little weary after a long shift. The place was also a little dirty when I went in. Lot of kids and families, for sure a family environment with a nice arcade to boot. Keep your kids busy and your sweet tooth happy! Job well done, Sugar Bowl!"}
{"text":"Yum City! I went here with a group of friends after having a few drinks and it was delicious. My fiance and I split the \"Baseball winner\" which had strawberry ice cream, mint chocolate chip ice cream topped with hot fudge and melted marshmallow sauce. I thought for sure I would get the diabetes. Even though they have Family Circus cartoons, I recommend this place  for people with and without kids. If you are in old town and are looking for a sweet treat this is your place."}
{"text":"Let's go to sugar bowl she said... it'll be fun she said... it's famous cause of Family Circus and it's a long standing Scottsdale anchor...

I get that.  I understand nostalgia as much as the next fella - but when you walk in a joint and immediately you know that not much has changed since the '60s, you know something's up.

I suppose, aside from the old pink d√©cor, I'm referring to the smell.  You know the one... like when you walk in someone else's grandparents home.  Or when you visit a funeral parlor.  That's it.

The menu is more than a little overwhelming.  Mostly due to flavors & menu items that were popular in the '60s and make the rest of us who weren't alive then scratch our heads.

Ya get three stars for nostalgia - for staying in business long enough to be jam packed busy on a weeknight for reasons beyond me.  

The ice cream was less than impressive, but I will admit I was entertained by the customers who were wide eyes remembering times they came there in their childhood... 

So, in summary, maybe it's worth checking this place out once, or bringing your kid for a scoop, but don't go here expecting delicious cream or amazing service, cause you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Menu far too confusing. My boyfriend was very upset with how many options they had yet nothing simple and clear. We just wanted a classic banana split. The gent that helped us was very eager to answer any questions we had and convinced us to try their chocolate soda which was less than satisfying. Overall spent 25 bucks on two banana splits and a soda. Also not a traditional bar counter. Could work on aesthetic. Banana was good though."}
{"text":"In a setting dripping in history and nostalgia, you find the best ice cream experience in the state of Arizona. A longstanding tradition amongst spring breakers, spring training visitors and families from around the country, the Sugar Bowl promises a celebration of flavor for your taste buds. The clientele spans generations; from geriatrics gumming their ice cream to small children dripping with melted creamy goodness on their chins, it has it all.  And the addition of the arcade in the back guarantees that the crumb crunchers will be entertained and work off some of their sugar high. A must for anyone visiting Old Scottsdale and looking for a special treat."}
{"text":"great place to sit down and enjoy a ice cream, the old fashion made this place unique. the orange raft is really bomb."}
{"text":"Cute little shop in a cute little town. The diner feel to this (mostly) ice cream shop is palpable, and the decor and style is nostalgic. Pink is definitely the theme here, down to the trademark pink napkins and menus. Service is friendly and efficient, and the check is paid in a no-hassle fashion by going up to the cashier window at the end. 

It's a solid ice cream place, but I mostly come here for the feel more than for the fare. I haven't tried any of the savory or hot dishes, so this review is for the ice cream only. I like that Sugar Bowl offers a variety of ice cream scoops, sundaes, and banana splits. 

Ice cream scoops:
I've tried the strawberry and Rocky Road here. I like that the strawberry had a tart bite instead of being all sweet, but the Rocky Road was pretty sweet. The chopped almonds added a nice crunch, but unfortunately the nuts themselves were a little stale.

Buster Brownie sundae:
My friend raved about this sundae, so when he ordered it, I of course had to try some. The brownie and vanilla ice cream were fine, nothing special, but the marshmallow fluff was pretty good. It was pillowy soft and sweet. If I had ordered this sundae, I would've gotten it with coffee ice cream to better balance out the sweetness of the brownie and marshmallow fluff. I also thought the whipped cream on top was overkill with the marshmallow, as it was sweet on top of sweet on top of sweet. 

Rocky Mountain sundae:
I liked the coffee ice cream in this sundae, and I thought though it was one of the sweeter coffee ice creams I've had, the robust coffee flavor came through nicely. The chocolate syrup was too much, and the ice cream was just swimming in syrup by the third bite. 

Creamed walnut fudge sundae:
Meh, this sundae was probably my least favorite out of the three I tried, although that could have been because my friend substituted the vanilla ice cream for chocolate. This resulted in sweetness overload and pretty one-dimensional flavor. 

Price are reasonable, and substitutions for different kinds of ice cream in the sundaes come free of charge (which I really appreciate)."}
{"text":"I like this place, more for the decor and location, than for the actual ice cream. It's been there since the 50's, and Family Circus has something to do with it, cause the comic is all over the place. Everything is pink and hasn't ever been remodeled as far as I can tell, so it's kind of like being in Main Street at Disney World.The ice cream is your typical ice cream. I had the orange sherbet and it was good. Cooled me down, but not mind blowing or anything. They have food but I didn't order any. 3 stars for Ice Cream, 4 stars for cute."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, mediocre ice cream. I got the buster sundae thinking the brownie would be warm and fresh, wasn't. The ice cream itself was ok. Tasted like something you could easily get at a grocery store.

I also got a patty melt. It was good. 4/5 stars just on that particular item. 

Try other spots before you try Sugar Bowl."}
{"text":"Such a cute and quaint ice cream place! The \"Gosh-Awful-Gooey Banana Split\" was gooey without a doubt and a personal favorite of mine. It doesn't get much better than Turkish coffee ice cream and raspberry sorbet topped with caramel and sweet marshmallow sauce. Yum-yum. Not only do I love Sugar Bowl's treats, but the entire late 50's- early 60's atmosphere makes it even better! From the pink walls and the pink seats to the pink menus, it is an incredibly adorable place."}
{"text":"thank y'all for still giving us amazing service when we walk in 20 minutes before closing. I can't stress how wonderful that is. on top of perfecting our treats every single time?! 10 STARS!!! it is so yummy I think about it all the time. and it's very reasonably priced. can't wait to see ya again, Sugar Bowl!!"}
{"text":"Too cute! This is the perfect place to end any day.  There is a huge selection of treats from the traditional ice cream sundae to the most sinful concoctions you dare to have. The ice cream was good but the true experience was the atmosphere which was phenomenal. We had the sweetest waitress ever. It is a place where you can sit back and enjoy your ice cream. There is no rushing or pressure to turn over the table.  The prices are super reasonable.

Support the local shop!  Give them a try the next time you have the urge to spend $7 at Cold Stone."}
{"text":"Looking for an old school ice cream parlor experience with a ton of Old Town history?  This is your place!

With simple menu offerings from ice cream and sundaes, special creations, milkshakes and malts, you're sure to get your sugar fix on... and if you're in the mood for something savory, they offer a limited selection of salads, sandwiches, and burgers too.  I can't speak to the food offerings though.  

On a recent visit for a friend's birthday, I went with a scoop of their ice cream flavor of the day (it happened to be pumpkin) and a slice of their homemade banana nut bread.  Both were sweet and edible and servings are pretty generous too.  I must admit however, that neither blew me away.  We sat in the arcade area and service was attentive enough, but I can't say I'll be rushing back.  

There is something to be said for the old school feel of this place, but I'm a sucker for all of the many frozen yogurt and even soft serve ice cream places out there now-a-day... 

My advice? Go to Sugar Bowl every now and again for the overall experience and don't think about your diet when you're there.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I was very hangry prior to coming here and generally steer away from \"touristy\" establishments. The only thing that swayed us to come in was the \"fresh oven roasted turkey\". My Bf order the turkey sandwich and I ordered the grilled chicken filet sandwich. The turkey sandwich came out without toasted bread and the turkey was clearly deli turkey which was very misleading. My chicken sandwich was not bad but I had to pay to add everything on it. It literally comes with just chicken and bread and its an additional charge to add things like tomato, lettuce, and onion. I don't mind paying to add things but the server did not make us aware of the additional charge we just found out when we got our receipt. It got the job done but I would not go back for the price and food quality."}
{"text":"An Old Town Scottsdale tradition and a required stop for any sightseers. Food is good (and huge potions). Ice cream is good. Ambiance and history are great. Service is a little hit or miss but very good tonight. Great for families and kids if you need dinner in addition to ice cream and not very expensive."}
{"text":"It's looking a little rough around the edges but the iconic Sugar Bowl is still a favorite family event when in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Went here one night with a group of friends. This place is pink, crowded, and really not that impressive. I ordered some sorbet and it was bland - that in itself is an accomplishment - bland sorbet.  The 50's style booth seats were very uncomfortable (maybe to discourage staying long?) and the tables were the wrong height for eating. I had to strain to get above face level of my food (and i'm a normal sized woman) It was also very very (very) loud in here.

I'll avoid going here again. The quality of the product was just too poor - I'd rather hit up a Whole Foods and get some good sorbet without the discomfort and echoing nosie."}
{"text":"Okay. First things first. I love ice cream. But this place was insane! 

1. The atmosphere. Super cute and fun! Like an old diner + arcade. 

2. The Camelback Soda was incredible! They take old fashioned soda and pour it over their vanilla ice cream. It's so, so good!!

If you're in the area, this is a must have."}
{"text":"I think I spotted that big pink building a few years ago, and I kept saying someday I will go check it out! Well the someday showed up! You can guess I was tickled pink for sure! 

The Sugar Bowl was exactly how I had imagined it to be, from the tables, chairs, booths, counter/bar, an old fashioned ice cream parlor! But even better, it's all in this delicious pink! Feel in love with place at 1st site!

I ordered the Buster Brownie Sunday with cookie dough ice cream, marshmallow cream, chocolate sauce and a cherry; this was the perfect sweet dish! Only complaint I could have is the brownie was too small for me, and not as moist as I would have liked, but I like my brownies chewy, and I guess my cherry feel off before it got to the table because I didn't see it anywhere, but really these issues did not stop me from devouring my sunday and almost licking my bowl clean. Haha

I really enjoyed my visit to the Sugar Bowl, love the place and I will be back for sure! Im sure my grandson would like to go with me to get some ice cream."}
{"text":"Had their Almond pralines ice cream.  It was good but disappointment I only had 3 roasted almond in my whole dish.  The ice cream was also very melty.  The brownie thing M had looked so good.  I guess I need to come back and try another item.  The service was great!!!"}
{"text":"We love coming to sugar bowl every other weekend. Whenever we have any out of town we guest visiting we always bring them to sugar bowl. As much as we love coming here, they need to have better hostess or at least people can communicate with people.  The service lack of enthusiasm, not much engaging with guests. Love the ice cream not loving their customer service"}
{"text":"The place isn't that bad.  It's kitschy because of the pinkish interior, and the ice cream is good.  My only problem is that it's too crowded...thanks to Bil Keane."}
{"text":"We just loved this old vintage little ice cream parlor!  The staff was hustling and the food coming out of the kitchen looked wonderful!  We will return!  It is always packed with people but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"To someone from out of town, it is obvious upon stepping inside the Sugar Bowl that it is an institution.  I like mom and pop places, but especially eateries with history.  It is very cute...all pink and retro, and it even has an arcade area off to the side for the kiddies to enjoy.  The thick layers of dust coating the knick knacks around the cashier and the yellowing clippings of Family Circus cartoons indicate that many generations have enjoyed Sundaes or Banana Splits here.  The tired dingy walls must have witnessed much history over the years, and they desperately need a fresh coat of paint!  But still, it is a happy place, and I like that vibe.  After a nice meaty burrito in a different part of town, I was in the mood for dessert, and that's why I sauntered on in and grabbed a seat at the counter.

According to the menu, a Top Hat Sundae consists of a \"Fluffy Sugar Bowl creampuff filled with creamy vanilla ice cream, then showered with hot fudge\" for $4.95.  This sounded perfect for the occasion!  I was really looking forward to a big scoop of ice cream sandwiched within a sliced flaky creampuff with its rich creamy custard-like contents oozing all over the ice cream and mixing with the hot fudge.  But behold, there was no custard-like yumminess at all within the CREAM-puff.  The ice cream was actually stuffed into a cream-LESS puff then smothered with hot fudge.  What a disappointment!  I was craving something extremely decadent!  Instead, it was an awkward combination that did not mix well.  The hot fudge did not soften or moisten the dry puff, nor did the melting ice cream.  The puff was so dry that I had to saw it apart with my spoon into pieces that would fit into my mouth.  To make sure the dry puff did not get stuck in my esophagus, I washed it down with a glass of water after carefully chewing the ice cream and fudge into it.  Perhaps I was assuming too much when I thought that a CREAM-puff would actually contain CREAM in it before they put the ice cream in?  I did like the contrast in temperatures and textures, however, between the ice cream and the hot fudge, but all hot fudge sundaes have this characteristic.

For such a venerable old-fashioned institution, I would have hoped for the ice cream to be manufactured by hand within the store, but alas, it did not have that home-made creamy dairy taste.  The ice cream was stiff and cake-like, not soft-creamy.  It reminded me of the higher-end stuff you can buy from the supermarket.   I don't object to factory-made ice cream in general, but with the way this establishment looked, I expected more.  In Sugar Bowl's defense, however, it did not claim anywhere in the menu that the ice cream served here was hand-made in the store, but I only realized this after re-studying the menu following my first unsatisfying bite.  I did not order any other item, so I cannot speak to the sandwiches or the salads, but overall, it was a mediocre experience.  It leads me to believe that many locals come here more out of a sense of loyalty or more to experience the nostalgia of younger years as opposed to the excellence of the food and desserts.  I am glad I experienced it, but next time I'm in town, I probably won't go out of my way to return and re-live it!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here for an ice cream treat. The 1950s vibe is funky & fun with a small arcade on one side of the restaurant. It's awesome that this place has been around for over 60 years and it's still standing. I would assume that they are thankful for baseball spring training during the spring to keep them extra busy. For about $10 we split a shake, a 2 scoop ice cream with fudge and one of their specialist sundaes. Plenty of ice cream for 4 adults. Our son couldn't get enough of the horse ride in the arcade room. They also have counter seating if you are solo or your just a couple. You pay at the counter once your finished as well for that old school vibe."}
{"text":"Guess what's good!

A 52 year old ice cream parlor and luncheon, that's what!

We were looking for someplace else but head cold's got me down and I was tired of walking so we scooted in. I was a little annoyed at the hostest when she gave me a screwy look when I asked her what kind of highchairs they had (I have a little baby- if it's the old wooden ones, they won't do- he's too little- but they have the good, plastic ones so I'm mad at her that I didn't push the issue. Bygones.)

Anyhoot- patty melt- good. I got mine with bacon. 

And the top hat? This sundae don't play. 

Coffee ice cream was respectable. 

And what a nice little tea pot you came in, black tea! 

Hooray for you, Sugar Bowl!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an old fashion ice cream parlor this is the place to go. There are multiple bananas split options, parfaits and a special flavor of the month - we visited in October so of course the flavor is pumpkin pie. 

Pretty diverse ground of people enjoying ice cream as well as food like burgers and sandwiches.  Great place to visit and get relief from the Arizona heat.  Ice cream was rich and creamy!"}
{"text":"This is a Scottsdale Icon.  Old Fashioned ice-cream parlor, set in old town Scottsdale.  It's always busy here.  Not your fancy place, and not a commercial establishment.  If you like local restaurants that have family appeal, you'll love the Sugar Bowl."}
{"text":"What's not to like about ice cream (unless you have a lactose allergy, of course!).  The inside is adorable and it offers a ton of ice cream options, so there's something for everyone.  Great staff here as well...our server was fabulous!  To the reviewers complaining about cleanliness...I have a bit of OCD--especially at restaurants.  Was the bathroom the cleanest/nicest I've ever used?  No--I would say more \"old\" than \"dirty\", but at least it worked and had soap (ever been to a restaurant where there's no soap in the bathroom...how gross.).  I didn't notice any crumbs on the floor or on seat cushions...In my opinion though, I'd rather have crumbs on the floor than have someone sweeping or vacuuming next to me while I'm trying to eat."}
{"text":"Sandwich and chips were so tasty! So many yummy choices for ice cream too!! Our ice cream was fantastic, this place is great for kids or ice cream lovers !"}
{"text":"Creeeeepy. Very pink. Slow service. Brimming with weird old people. Ice cream was good, though."}
{"text":"OK, so what if it's an authentic 1950s ice cream parlor? The stuff they're scooping up is boring major brand-name label ice cream full of air, and the toppings are nothing special? And the wallpaper is dirty and faded? And the carnival-esque decor is kinda creepy, unfortunately like some of the elderly clientele who sit here staring sadly off into space as their ice cream sodas melt away? You can almost imagine the opening scenes of a tear-jerker Lifetime movie set here. That's not good."}
{"text":"This place is me and my girlfriends go to spot for sundaes of Sunday! It has amazing atmosphere, good food and relatively cheap. They have something to satisfy everyone's needs. I recommend the butter pecan top hat--a super flaky delicious pasty filled with the icecream of your choice topped with decedent hot fudge. I drool just thinking about."}
{"text":"I'm not one to be too picky on ice cream. You ask me \"ice cream?\".. I answer, \"hell yea, where?!\"

I was invited to a social event here. First off, I walk in greeted by a host and ask her to point out the company hosting the social event. She has no idea where, who, what and disappears to ask someone. Finally, she thinks she knows and walks us to the right side where the arcade is at! Tada - there they are, all 10 of them! I mean, the ice cream parlor is NOT that big! How does she not know where our party is at? Ugh.. Anyway..

I order a sundae with hot fudge, mint chocolate ice cream and coffee ice cream. I told my waitress I want a little bit of fudge, but when I get my sundae, it's drenched with fudge from the bottom and top, whip cream and a cherry! You can't even see the ice cream without searching for it! Some of you may think, \"yea, whip cream, fudge, what the hell is she talking about?! That sounds good!\" I say, \"That's a little too much!\"

It's like the guy that is trying too hard to get the girl. Dude, don't take the girl to Ruth Chris Steakhouse and wear a suit on your first date - take her to Postinos with a nice shirt and jeans. All I need is two scoops of ice cream, a little fudge and a smudge of whip cream - that's it!

The parlor is truly old school - the bathroom needed to be cleaned and the games are outdated, but cute for the kiddos!"}
{"text":"Walked in 20 minutes before they closed and they claimed they were already closed..... it was 9:38 and they CLAIM THEYRE CLOSED?!?! the greeter was very rude about the fact that i wasn't allowed to get some ice cream even thought i asked if i could get it togo just to be polite. i will never go here again and i recommend you don't either until they hire new staff. being in the industry, i would never think about doing this to a customer."}
{"text":"A great place to bring out-of-towners. It's a Scottsdale institution. An old fashioned ice cream shop. A great place to grab a grilled cheese and a shake. It is adorable inside. It feels like you're stepping back in time. They also have a room with some arcades for kids. Delicous ice cream!"}
{"text":"This is an ice cream parlor that's been in this location for almost 60 years now.  The ice cream is good, and the interior has a nostalgic feel.  It's not a very expensive place, nor is the food remarkable or a good value.

We've eaten here for over 20 years, but seldom.  The food used to be pretty good, now it's just decent.

My wife and I had the Reuben.  I love Reubens and so does she.  Commendably they ask if you want mustard (yellow) or thousand island (an abomination).  I make a very good authentic one myself.  The one I was served today had four thin slices of nearly tasteless corned beef, topped with some cole-slaw (why???) a bit of sauerkraut and a little bit of relatively bland white cheese (a Reuben is supposed to have Swiss cheese).  It was made with a bland rye bread with oatmeal crust.  My first bite was gristle such that the first half of my sandwich fell apart and the ingredients fell out (except for the cheese).  My second bite was similar and so was the third, I had managed to chew and swallow about half the first sandwich half, a quarter of it (no easy feat) before I got to a decent bite, and thankfully I managed to easily masticate the rest of my sandwich.

My wife's sandwich wasn't tough at all, but she was similarly unimpressed.  The chips were fine though mine were made soggy by falling slaw and kraut.  The dill pickles were nearly inedible- they were tough, though they did taste like dill.  Lest you think that we should be gumming our food at some cafeteria for retirees who never had a dental plan- we aren't retired, and we have good dental insurance coverage.

I will say- they have painted the place since we were last there.  It's due for a good upholstery cleaning though.  The men's and women's rooms are on opposite ends of the dining area.  I can only comment on the men's room: It was clean but they have a narrow door about three feet from a second one.  They open inward so you will have to grab at least one handle after you wash your hands and discard the automatically dispensed paper towel.

I think we've had enough of the food.  But if we ever need a malt, we'll be back."}
{"text":"I came here just for the touristy attraction of it all and a friend recommended it because their kids had good memories of it. We did it, and had a shake/scoop of sherbet and such and were done. It was just a 'been there done that' type of thing. It was tasty and good, nothing to write home about but something that the kids will remember.  

I did like the old 'Family Circus' cartoons on their menu, THAT brought back a lot of memores, RIP Bill Keane!"}
{"text":"It's a no frills old fashioned creamery. I've had a lot better ice cream elsewhere, but you really come here for the atmosphere. A bit of a tourist trap. They push the Family Circus angle a lot. Service was decent for being served by a teenager. It's a good place to stop off when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I. LOVE. SUGAR. BOWL. 

It is such a cute little ice cream shop nestled in the adorable little old town. Everything inside is pink. If Barbie owned an ice cream shop, it would look exactly like Sugar Bowl. And I mean that in the best way possible. It's so cute. 

I've never eaten the actual food here, but I can vouch that the ice cream is fantastic. I have had the brownie sundae a few times and the top hat Sundae is always a favorite of mine. My guy likes the root beer floats a lot. The best part is that they're open late on the weekends (until midnight!!!) so if you're craving a treat later in the evening, Sugar Bowl is the perfect stop. 

The staff is friendly and welcoming and the building is clean. There's a cute little arcade in there as well. Nice booths and an adorable bar for you to sit up at and order a float or sundae. Honestly, the perfect representation of an old time soda shop. 

Go visit them! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Veggie sandwich was fresh and full of veggies. Chili burger was under whelming and cheese is an extra charge and doesn't come with chips or fries or anything. Turkey and bacon club was good. Bacon was thick and crispy. Black raspberry malt with marshmallow was very sweet. The coffee ice cream was delicious. Fun old diner. Needs some maintenance and wait staff didn't seem too knowledgeable about menu. We would still return for a sweet treat."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, takes you back to when ice cream shops were destinations and not drive thru's. Nice location within Old Town to walk around."}
{"text":"Perfect for sundaes and ice cream shakes of the most traditional varieties, but that's about it. 

I remember being crushed when the flagship location at Central and Camelback closed down and/or moved. I have since visited the new location as an adult (technically speaking) and was a little disappointed. 

The sandwiches and soups are mediocre at best and the desserts are good but in that Joni Loves Chachi sort of way \"One shake with . . . two straws [gaze longingly].\" 

For me, there is occasion to patronize a place like this but not all that often. It seems like with such a specific appeal they have whittled themselves into a corner without offering much else."}
{"text":"This place is super cute and extremely pink. I've only gone here twice but I really love this ice cream parlor. The ice cream here is fairly priced and extremely tasty. That being said I have never tried the food. I really don't plan on it either. I come here for the ice cream and the 1950's I've cream parlor vibe. That being said I've never had a problem with the service. If your in old town you should check it out."}
{"text":"What the heck is wrong with people. You come here for the ice cream! Not the furniture? How can you take away a star for furniture? Please stay away if you are that snobby! This place has been the same since it opened that is the charm of this place. The lady who took a star away for kids enjoying themselves should stay home as well. This place is an institution and none of your opinions matter. I have spoken. The mic has been dropped. Just stop. I only came here for the hours, but the reviews really pissed me off."}
{"text":"I took my wife out for dinner and instead of eating something almost healthy,we found ourselves at Sugar Bowl. I wasn't in the mood for a sundae, so I ordered a tuna melt sandwich.  The waitress assured me, that the sandwich was nothing more, nothing less then plain tuna and melted cheese,  on the top of a choice of bread. Well it wasn't exactly true. I got pickles. A huge pickle on the top of the potato chips and some more inside the sandwich. I hate pickles. I despise pickles. I hate how pickles look, taste or smell. You could probably torture me with pickles. At least the sundae was good, my wife enjoyed it. Hence the two stars."}
{"text":"Our uber driver recommended this place and said he used to work there when he was younger. Cool old school looking ice cream parlor they had good desserts in big portions, I was recommended the camelback float with strawberry and wasn't disappointed. Not sure I'd eat there regular food menu as it didn't seem to look very appetizing but desserts were the way to go, I'd return and recommend"}
{"text":"A must stop when visiting Scottsdale.   
Cute old diner pink decor and a game room in the back for the kiddos. 
Hard to make a decision on which frozen deliciousness to get.  We both chose sundaes and were very pleased.  Be prepared though, they're big!!   We probably could've gotten by sharing one.  
Quick service."}
{"text":"I look forward to going to the Sugar Bowl when I'm in Scottsdale.  Old time ice cream parlors are a vanishing breed in the US.   There are so few places left where you can get an ice cream soda.  That's why I really like this place!  There are so many ice cream treats that are not found elsewhere.  Plus, as others have pointed out, it's nice to see a place that has withstood the test of time---especially in a high growth area.  So many places come and go but the Sugar Bowl remains.

Do pay it a visit if you like ice cream!  The service is friendly and prompt.  Just remember---when you are ready to pay, you don't pay the server, you go to the cash register and pay."}
{"text":"Love the camelback soda! Delicious, good service, even when busy! Listened to a little kid next to me ask for \"that cherry stuff that hardens on ice cream.\" Nothing like that here; lots of sugar, but very straight forward simple food and ice cream creations."}
{"text":"The Sugar Bowl is more appealing on the outside along with history of the parlor than it truly is.  With its vibrant, inner-child eliciting curb appeal, you have this strange desire to know what's going on inside and to satisfy your sweet tooth.  

My fiance and I have been here twice, and both times were just ok.  It's pretty cool to know that the Sugar Bowl has been around in SCO for over 50 years, as this is a pretty young city, but the vibe hasn't changed much since the 50s and it could use a little updating.  Don't get me wrong, I love a good charm/notalgia to a restaurant, but something about the SB has a weird, almost grimy vibe.  They do serve 'real food' outside of sweets, but I've only had their ice cream combos.  They are pretty generous in their portions, but you have to be careful as to what you order.  The first time we went, I got some crazy sundae, and I was total regretsy.  My fiance got a malt, and I wished I had ordered one.  Our second visit, I ordered a vanilla malt, and my fiance ordered the Top Hat Sundae.  He wished he has ordered the malt, ha.  We did see other sundaes that looked way better than the two we tried, but it's hard to try a third sundae when the first two were just ok.  And how do you screw up a sundae?  By serving an old cream puff (the Top Hat), that is so dry you don't want to finish the fudgy ice cream.  

There isn't anything majorly wrong with the Sugar Bowl, but there isn't much of a wow factor either.  Cool place to stop if you're walking around Old Town and need a break for something sweet.  It's a once a year type place for me at best."}
{"text":"I didn't think I had a sweet tooth until I went to Sugar Bowl. I have sadly only been there once but the cravings keep me up most nights now. There is no turning back. No wonder this place is so popular. There is was a waiting time on a Saturday night as everyone seemed to have sleeped walked into Sugar Bowl for for delicious sweets. The fudge covered icecream donut is my new favorite desert. I think I may be in love."}
{"text":"This historic Scottsdale landmark has been with us for so long that everyone in town has probably eaten there, and if not, at least driven by the pink restaurant.

The food is good, basic comfort food, and the sundaes and shakes are wonderful.

So most folks end their restaurant visit with at least one person from the party visiting the restroom.  Save yourself and DO NOT do that here.  It was scary, in disrepair, and absolutely filthy.  What a sad way for a restaurant to allow their guests to end their dining visit.  Why on Earth would a restauranteur allow this to be the last thing their diners experience, thus leaving a bad taste in one's mouth? 

Now I understand the historic aspect of a building with regards to being on the Historic Registry limiting what changes can be made, etc...  But this in no way has anything to do with cleanliness.  The linoleum in the bathroom can come clean if it is scrubbed properly.  The walls were also so dirty that it appeared there was greasy grime all over the edging, and mold around the sink.  Ick!

So then I left the restroom prompted to look a little more closely at the overall cleanliness of the place.  The top backs of the booths were equally grimy where dust has been allowed to settle and remain there.  The edges of the floor in the restaurant area looked like the whole tile area in the bathrooms.  There were dozens of little flies flittering all around us during our meal.

If the front of the house looks like this, what must the kitchen be like?  I have loved visitng Sugar Bowl for decades, but I can assure you I won't be back."}
{"text":"Full of 1950s kitsch--it's a throwback ice cream parlor. I loved the camelback soda--I ordered it with raspberry soda and chocolate ice cream and it was delicious (highly recommended!)"}
{"text":"This place is just cute good old fashioned fun! The ice cream is nothing to scream about but its a nice change of pace to the Dairy Queens, Cold Stones, and Baskin Robbins. Definitely a fun little place to take people visiting in town! I wouldn't necessarily drive out of my way to get there, especially because finding parking in old town can be a bit of a nightmare. But the prices are good, there is a bunch of video games in the back for the kids to play but the bathrooms are not so great! Avoid those is possible. But enjoy the cute Family Circus cartoons."}
{"text":"Although I doubt this would be able to compete with some of the sweet shops I have hit in other major cities, I felt like for Scottsdale, this would be as good as it gets (I've only been here for five days, but still!).

The atmosphere, like the sign out front, is old school; the dessert selection was perfect for any warm weather day; the prices were fair, if not a little high given the size of things like the shakes; if you sit at the counter, you'll have ice cream in your hands in three minutes.  The folks behind the counter were really hustling when I visited this weekend, so I get the sense that these people take dessert as seriously as I do.  The Old Dutch Milkshake was thick; I wish it was larger, but my wife probably does not!!  A nice chaser for many of the meals you'll have along Scottsdale Road."}
{"text":"Really?

$5.95 for a one scoop sundae?  Yes!

Me: Excuse me, this should have whipped cream and a cherry.

Them:  Sorry, our whipped cream machine is broken.  Would you like a cherry?

Me (thought):  1. Tell me up front.   2.  Send someone to the store to buy Rediwhip!

$5.95?  Really?  Are we in Los Angeles at these prices?"}
{"text":"I was one of these foolish tourist that actually thought she could walk around in 110+ heat and humidity.  Hahahahah!  I had been meandering around downtown Scottsdale idly looking at the Southwestern stuff made in Taiwan when I stumbled upon this ice cream parlor.

Perfect!  I need a break and came in by myself.  The host said I was welcome at the bar or wherever.  I looked around and the place was filled with cute old people enjoying the daily lunch and ice cream smeared kids.  Heh.

I had a scoop of mint chip and iced tea.  I've have had better ice cream but because this place was so nicely air-conditioned, the service was great (the guy  constantly refilled my glass of water) and I had nostalgic longings for Farrell's (the ice cream parlor in LA I went to as a kid), I loved the place."}
{"text":"Sugar coma! that's how I am after having sweat treats in this pinky place. I was craving for sweets and we had the fortune to stop here. 

WARNING, make sure you have somebody to share any treat...specially if you get saturated with sugary stuff after 2 spoons. I had a Blarney dream, where the mint got lost in the butter pecan ice cream. And their Top hat sundae...I wouldn't be able to eat half of it! Be ware of what you wish for...here it may come true :)."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place ever since I can remember but the last time I was there, we were sitting waiting to place our order and cockroaches came crawling out of the booth next you us. It's safe to say that we immediately walked out and will not be returning."}
{"text":"I got the Top Hat Sundae.  It is basically a big cremepuff with ice cream in the middle and it was drenched in chocolate syrup.  pretty good.  i liked it."}
{"text":"We spent a few hours in Old Town, which is adorable!

We weren't planning on dessert, but we walked by the Sugar Bowl and we were quite intrigued by it.

The restaurant is very old time-y and pink!  Think of an ice cream counter from back in the 1950's and that gives you an idea of this business.  I love unique throwback types of places like this.

The menu did have some actual meal choices, but we mostly focused on picking out a dessert.

I had a chocolate malt which was one of the best that I have had.  I went with the version that involved lining the glass with marshmallow, very tasty, but maybe too sugary.

My husband opted for a regular chocolate malt and he thought it was divine.

Waitstaff was friendly and attentive.  The restaurant looked clean and kept up.

We hope to come back before we leave the area.

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I can't stand their food. Maybe the special on Fridays.... But great ice cream and fun for the kids. When the games aren't out of order.
I recommend the 23 Skidoo. Coffee, chocolate, and almonds."}
{"text":"My husband and I realized after being together for almost 10 years we've never gotten a banana split! What better time than to splurge while at the sugar bowl. 

Stepping in is a blast from the past-50s motif, pink walls, diner booths. We sat at the counter and ordered a diy sundae. Way too much sugar for one sitting but worth the $8 to get our fill. There are a lot of ice cream choices in the area but this is a Scottsdale classic that will be around for generations to enjoy."}
{"text":"The ambience is awesome.  You don't get to eat at an old fashion ice cream parlor often.  This was a perfect way to end our walk through downtown old Scottsdale. A variety of of sundaes to choose from. They make their own brownies which is delicious.  We were visiting in October and my wife loved the seasonal pumpkin ice cream."}
{"text":"Sweet Spot.......NO it's not!

C'mon, it's pink. It's got ice cream inside. It's retro. Everything here screams \"this place is Tubular, Hip, Rad, Cool, Tight, Phat\" So whats the deal?
 First off, I was under the impression they had homemade ice cream. They don't. It's Dreyers. With canned whipped toppings, canned cherries, canned sauces.....nothing here is unique!  Aha, besides the decor! I blew through 1500 calories + for garbage. I was very dissapointed. So let me get on to the dish I had. I ate half of \"The Top Hat\". Described as a creampuff stuffed with rich vanilla ice cream and covered with hot chocolate. Sounds good doesn't it? The cream puff shell which should be light and fluffy with a \"slight\" pull was extremely tough, flavorless, dry and I am assuming old! How can they even call it a cream puff when the best part (the cream) is non existent? So my dry ball was filled with Dreyers ice cream. Not good. 
 We actually ate lunch first. They have an \"American\" menu. Egg Salad, BLT, Burgers, Tuna, Grilled Cheese etc.... . The problem is nothing was good. I ordered a patty melt. The burger was tasteless and very, very  small. Id say about the size patty you would find on a Mcdonalds Kids Cheeseburger. The Kicker....No fries. No Fries? What the Fuck? Chips?Stick these chips in some ice cream and get creative. Daughter had a BLT, two strips, yes, two strips of bacon on wonder bread. Coleslaw was the WORST I HAVE EVER HAD! This place just sucks. Huge upset for a place I was really looking forward to. I try to review the food as much as possible but I have to say this about the service. SSLLOOWW! We had a group of 8 and our waitress could only bring out 2 drinks at a time. 4 damn trips to just get our drinks. They charge for refills too! I guess that is how they keep that nostalgic feel because restaurants have not been charging refills since the days of the flood!"}
{"text":"Ha! Talk about insanely indulgent options!  1st time here was with friends recently and we had a blast.  I love how many options there were for the ice cream \"stock\" choices and \"build your own\".  And my \"one\" scoop sundae was of course way too much. Which meant I enjoyed every spoonful!

Really crowded when we went on a weeknight, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute! It was our stop after we had our lunch at a nearby sandwich place. They had a good selection of ice cream desserts and the staff was very friendly. I thought the ice cream was made in house but I think I was wrong. I'm pretty sure it was Dreyer's ice cream. My favorite part of this place is the arcade! My boyfriend bought $5.00 worth of tokens and we played to our little hearts desire. He barely beat my on the air hockey but I took him on the Wack a Shark (a lot like Wack a Mole). They had two basket ball games and a couple of ski balls too. There were no broken games, none that took our tokens anyway, and it was a perfect way to burn off that huge sundae we inhaled!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this ice cream place for about 3 years, and not once have I ever been disappointed! The sundaes never fail to succeed, and the classic parlor design really sets the theme. I highly recommend this ice cream place to anyone with a sweet tooth!

P.S. Order the cream puff sundae!"}
{"text":"I have only had the ice cream, but it was sooooo good! They have a lot of options, and the servers were all very friendly. It's a cute little diner, I highly suggest it. Even for just ice cream."}
{"text":"The ice cream is good, although they use mini marshmellows rather than marshmellow swirl in their rocky road, not my thing.The atmosphere is kitchy; very pink."}
{"text":"I am completely floored by all the reviews that are less then 5 stars! Seriously people, its ice cream, don't be so serious! 

I have been coming to the Sugar Bowl for yearssssss, I cant get enough of this place! 

Its always packed on the weekends, but the wait is hardly ever grueling. 

They do serve food here, think sandwiches your rad grandma would make you on a Sunday afternoon. Not mind blowing, but certainty yummy and hit the spot! 

I have only ever had the Top Hat here, I sub the vanilla ice cream for the coffee ice cream. This sundae is my crack! Its the fluffiest puff pastry, they cut off the top, cram a bunch of fabulous ice cream inside, put the little top back on and then smother it in the thickest, gooiest most heavenly hot fudge, ask for extra napkins (I always end up with a ring of hot fudge around my mouth like a 6 year old)!!! 

Yes the place has old ass wallpaper, its called history people its been around since 1958! Unlike the ever changing landscape and buildings of AZ this one has stayed true to itself. Forget the disco lights and loud music of MoJo, give me the big cushy pink booths and chipped tile floors of the glorious Sugar Bowl!!!"}
{"text":"Holy cuteness!!! Sugar Bowl has so much charm that I actually tasted it in my ice cream! It's an old school ice cream parlor with plenty of personality and divine desserts. They also serve cafe style food, though we didn't actually eat any meals here. 

My husband and I recently stayed at a hotel that was dangerously close, so we walked over for some sweets twice during our stay in Scottsdale. We pulled up a seat at the bar during our first visit and opted for a small table in the dining area on our second visit. Service was excellent both times. 

We each tried something different during our two stops. My husband and I both went with a simple two scoop in a cup our first time in. He chose chocolate chip and cookies & cream while I went with Dutch chocolate and raspberry. Each flavor was rich, creamy, and delicious. Our second trip was on our last night in town. Since I knew we wouldn't be returning again, I went all out and got their famous top hat sundae. OMG! This baby is a cream puff filled with vanilla ice cream (I opted for chocolate instead) and drenched with hot fudge. It was unbelievably good! My husband ordered a chocolate malt, which he enjoyed while eyeing up my sundae the entire time. :)

If you're in the area, stop in and cool off from that desert heat with some ice cream from Sugar Bowl. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food was okay it's very expensive supposed to be a 50's restaurant but they're playing rock music in there so does it feel like the old fashioned 50 place they have a back room for a kids party which is very cool"}
{"text":"This place is a child's dream. 3.5/5 stars.

The ice cream is really good, but I'm personally not a big fan of loud places with lots of kids, and this is one of them.

I had the butter pecan ice cream and my friends shared a sundae with vanilla and chocolate ice cream. They have limited selection in flavors, but the ones they have are pretty good! 

They have a ton of variety in how you take your ice cream, however... Float, split, sundae, etc. When you're craving sugar, this is the place to be. It's the neighborhood go-to for late night dessert. Bonus points for having the entire place decorated in pink!

Overall, not a bad place for fulfilling your ice cream craving, but be prepared to face loud children with tons of sugar."}
{"text":"Adorable, old fashioned Ice Cream shoppe on corner! 

Great service even though it was after 10pm and amazing but overwhelming options... when you have 3 pages of ice cream options / concoctions... it's awesome to see but also a little intimidating... so glad our waitress made recommendations!

We were there right before closing and never once felt rushed to leave. Hope to be able to go back someday!"}
{"text":"What a unique place.  Haven't been to an ice cream parlor since Farells as a kid.  Nothing like sitting down at a table and searching the menu for the best ice cream treat.  I ordered a banana split and it was awesome.  Kids got the brownie sundae which i snagged a few bites from.  Great place to take the kids, or just go as an adult and relive some childhood memories."}
{"text":"Throwback ice cream parlor that takes you back to the 1950s. The ice cream itself is nothing super special, but you go there for the atmosphere. Expect to be seated unless you're getting something to go.  The service is good, oh and the place is very clean. Our nine-year-old loved the little arcade in the corner that has skew ball and other games to win tickets for cheap prices. Overall, a good place to kill an hour if you're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Been going to the Sugar Bowl for 35 years.   I would not be writing this negative review  if this past Friday, August 23, 2013 had been an isolated bad experience.  I've been noticing a decline in the food and the wait staff now for over a year. My 2 young nephews and I showed up at 6:30pm on above said date.  We sat in our usual spot in the game room.  There were 4 other customers in the entire restaurant at the time.  10 minutes go by without any service.  Finally a female server shows up, I ask her what she can tell me about the Friday chicken special.  She claims, \"I don't know what it is.\" Me: \"can you please find out?\" Her: \"oh, you want me to check to see what it is?\"  
Another 10 minutes go by, she comes back and informs me of what it is.  I end up ordering the same three sandwiches my nephews and I always order.  No special requests except toasting the bread on one of the sandwiches.  Real simple.  So now after 20 minutes I also ask for water, napkins and silverware.  Nothing.  Our sandwiches arrive 45 minutes after we sit down...we're not in a hurry, the kids are playing games, no biggie but, I had to get up to get napkins and silverware and ask again for water as the manager watched! The 2 cold sandwiches were served on hot plates and the hot sandwich was served cold on a cold plate. The female wait staff finally brings water and apologizes about the poor service claiming, \"Sorry, we had an awkward shift change.\"  I couldn't help myself and snickered.  Half way through our meal, the place became packed with customers, large groups of people and the only thing I could think of was, good luck.   We ate, the kids played more games and the manager came around with more water never addressing the poor service we experienced.  Not one wait staff came near our table after that and I had to flag someone down and ask for our check.  First time in many many years I neglected to place a tip on the table. The clencher of it is, I truly have been getting the feeling that the owner and managers really don't care about the service, knowing because of the history and location, they will always get visitors from out of town to keep them afloat."}
{"text":"Walking in you get the feeling of family. There were a lot of families in for ice cream. Reading the menu affirms that feeling of family. It's been featured in comics and been in business since the 50's. I ordered the Orange Float and my coworkers had the Banana Split. Simply amazing. Definitely a great place to get ice cream or a sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dessert based on reviews.  Cute little place.   We ordered a small hot fudge sundae and a small pineapple sundae.  Both were very good and service was very quick."}
{"text":"In a word: Kitsch.

This 50's palace of pink serves up a number of ice cream dishes, including favorites such as banana splits and brownie sundaes as well as build your own creations.  The ice cream itself was underwhelming, I was expecting a homemade recipe, but was a little surprised when I saw tubs of Dreyers being brought into the front dining room.

Given it's location in Old Town Scottsdale, a venerable dumping ground of knick knacks galore, Sugar Bowl was exactly what I expected in terms of decor and atmosphere, kitsch, kitsch and more kitsch.

Where is Gelateria Parmalat when you need it?"}
{"text":"I came here on a hot day and was so happy I did. I enjoyed the brownie Sunday which was great for 2 reasons. One I love brownies and second when I asked the waitress for her recommendation this is what she offered. 

The restaurant also served food but the majority of customers including myself seemed to be enjoying ice cream and judging by the empty dishes including my own we all seemed to be thoroughly enjoying ourselves. The restaurant was clean and pink. The motif of the restaurant is pink and white or maybe it was originally red and white and with time it faded to pepto bismol pink. They could make a killing selling that stuff too because due to all of the over indulging people it is a necessity. 

Fortunately I don't live in Phoenix but when I find myself back I will make it a point to come to Sugar Bowl"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I stopped in for a sundae to top off our date night. We walked in about 30 minutes before closing. The staff was incredibly rude and made us feel very unwelcome, forcing us to sit at the bar (not at a table like we wanted) and at least 3 people came by advising us they are closing soon.

I certainly apologize for walking into your establishment during normal business hours to get a few scoops of ice cream... what were we thinking..."}
{"text":"walked over here after dinner down the street.
We ordered some ice cream only, service wasn't the best and the overall feel wasn't the greatest. could use come character. 
Most ice cream is just ice cream and that's what this is. wouldn't rush back"}
{"text":"Started with an immediate greeting followed by a torn, disgusting menu. I ordered the chef salad without meat. For $10.50 I got a small bowl of lettuce--at least it was fresh, one slice of American cheese, 1/2 a hard boiled egg and a tiny portion of banana nut bread. I decided to get dessert. Small hot fudge sundae. It was a decent size and they were fair with the hot fudge topping. I did not want whipped cream. The sundae was average.  I see m reason to return.  Server Brittany was very good."}
{"text":"The ice cream here is awesome! Huge scoops! Great service too!! Really enjoyed the fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I visited the Sugar Bowl this weekend and really wanted to love it. I was so excited to sample their delicious treats. However, before I could even raise the spoon to my mouth I discovered not one, not two but three roaches roaming around the restaurant. Gross!!! I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"I love Sugar Bowl! Their ice cream is delicious and the brownies are amazing! It's a cute little spot in Oldtown Scottsdale and totally pink inside. It's great for dates and pictures. The waitresses are always very nice and attentive, and I felt totally welcome here. Even if you don't have a hot date, come into Sugar Bowl to experience their homemade desserts! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great service! We stopped by for just for ice cream and wanted to sit down. This place was great. Looks like a great place to eat, too. We had already eaten though. Our server was really nice and treated us like any other customer. She wasn't short with us even though we only ordered ice cream. We appreciated the service and the ice cream was really good. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is adorable!!  It's an old fashioned little ice cream parlor and they also have some food like sandwiches.  The ice cream is excellent and it is the perfect place to stop in for a break and some ice cream while wandering around Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Everyone was very friendly. The food was great and service was fast. This is a must stop every time i am in town."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. I had the best egg salad sandwich ever and the Dutch chocolate shake was superb to say the least. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and would visit again!!!"}
{"text":"This place must have been packed back when Scottsdale High was open just down the way. Actually, it can still get pretty busy now. It's definitely got its appeal: huge scoops of ice cream in classic glass dishware, long spoons to accompany your tall milkshake, banana splits with all the fixings. But the d√©cor is straight from my beloved Grandma Mae's house- pink, pink, fake flowers, pink, pink, crocheted doilies, pink, and then some more pink. It burns my eyeballs. There IS a way to keep the integrity of a well-known location while updating its style, just saying. 

I still occasionally come here for a milkshake (thick, because otherwise it's like a heavy glass of melted ice cream. There's honestly no point to them giving you a spoon with their regular milkshakes) and they're pretty good. Sugar Bowl is the only place I've found that does chocolate chip milkshakes, so they're alright in my book. Plus, they have a really great selection of all sorts of desserts! Something for the whole family. Husband gets a sundae or maybe a hot dog and we'll sit over at the corner booth next to the window and watch all the out-of-towners walking around with their little maps arguing over which Gilbert Ortega they'd rather go to until they give up and come in to split a Buster Brownie. Good choice, guys."}
{"text":"I'm a third generation native and have never been here, I KNOW! Ordered the brownie sundae. Brownie was warm and got it with hot fudge instead of marshmallow. Only complaint is half a cherry instead of a whole."}
{"text":"On our way cross country we decided to stop and get one of our favorites ~ a 23 Skidoo. We have been stopping into the Sugar Bowl for YEARS on our travels to the Scottsdale area. We were sooooo disappointed. It is not the same. The restaurant itself was dirty, paper on the floor, customers standing around without anyone greeting them.

A 23 Skidoo is (was) one of my all time favorite ice cream treats. The wonderful chocolate coffee syrup was nothing like it was. in fact, it was like coffee had simply been poured in the middle with one scoop of ice cream on the bottom and one scoop above the coffee (see my picture of the 23 skidoo). The glass was sticky from where ice cream hands had handled it. When I asked about why the difference, our waitress responded with, \"we have knew people we're training and everyone makes it different.\" 

I ask our waitress to bring me some chocolate syrup ~ it never came. She said she asked another wait staff to bring it over. Umm, if you are a waitress waiting on a customer you respond directly and then follow up with our customers. Perhaps more customer service training is needed. 

I also ordered the tea sandwiches which is a combination of 3 triangle tea sandwiches; egg salad, tuna salad and corn beef salad. The bread was dry as if the sandwich had been made up and left out until someone else ordered the same sandwiches. 

This restaurant is in a prime location in Old Scottsdale ~ it is incredibly sad to watch this '50 style diner show they do not care about their customers/restaurant like it use to."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch today because my daughter loves their egg salad sandwich. We typically come for the sweets of course, but so glad we tried some more lunch portions. I ordered the BLT with avocado and it was amazing! Adding avocado at some places can be sketchy and they can be soggy. My sandwich was perfect, avocado fresh. It came with a huge pickle and chips I'm not a huge fan of chips of any kind, but these tasted great. Service was great. Downside was the cashier when we pay had hickies all over her neck. Not something I'd want my customers seeing. Not too classy. Yummy food, amazing treats,  and lets say no to hickies!"}
{"text":"Best.coffee.ice.cream.ever! 

I was on vacation in scottsdale and was recommended this place by a local friend. As it would turn out my uber driver, would also recommend such place. Right in the heart of old downtown scottsdale.

I git a scoop of the coffee ice cream/ it was cold and creamy and amazing it hit the spot and the price was stellar.

Party room and arcade for kids would make this a perfect place to hist a birthday party"}
{"text":"Craving something sweet, but tired of the usual small ice cream shops? Then I would recommend The Sugar Bowl in Down Town Scottsdale. Step back in time into a pink ice cream parlor with a soda fountain and a huge menu full of ice cream treats. The Sugar Bowl offers pretty much anything that you can do with ice cream, including fantastic sparkling ice capades! In case you are wondering what a sparkling ice capade is, it's sherbert blended with sprite and the end result tastes like a push pop shake! The sugar bowl is almost always full of people, usually a blend of tourists and locals, but I have never had to wait to long to get a table. Also on the weekends they usually have a balloon artist walking around making whatever you please. I would recommend the balloon hats. So whether you are walking around the art galleries in Old Town Scottsdale  or hitting up the nightlife for a fun detour try The Sugar Bowl!"}
{"text":"I'm giving the Sugar Bowl four stars with a bit of reservation, but it's worth a visit if you're in the area (I've been twice).  First of all, it's an old fashioned ice cream parlor, which is hard to find.  The menu is reminiscent of ice cream parlors \"back in the day.\"  The grilled cheese sandwich is good...basic and good...served with potato chips and a pickle.  Nothing fancy there, but good.  The menu includes a variety of sandwiches and salads for \"real food.\"   The point of coming here, however, is for ice cream.  A small sundae is sufficient given the richness of the ice cream and toppings, and it really hits the spot.  They have a rather limited selection of ice cream flavors, but a pretty good selection of toppings.  They also have a wide variety of pre-designed sundaes, but I know I wouldn't be able to finish them. The ice cream is really good as are the toppings, so definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. It means a lot to my family because my dad used to bring me here growing up, and I now bring my son. It is family owned and operated, and they are just wonderful. Do yourself a favor and try the Buster Brownie with both chocolate sauce and marshmallow cream. I have dreams about it!"}
{"text":"I love going to Sugar Bowl when I am in town! The ice cream is so good and decadent. I see other reviews saying that you can find what they have in other places but I have to disagree. They have such a diverse, creative, and tasty menu. I haven't seen anything that really compares. 

I just wish they would give the place a little remodel because it truly is a diamond in the rough. And service at the counter could be a bit more attentive. They haven't really had one dedicated server at the counter when we've gone. Regardless it's been a great place over the years to stop in at for a break in the middle of shopping or driving around."}
{"text":"My niece noticed this gem when we were walking around old town this afternoon. Great price, good customer service and decent food. My neice is now trying to convince her mom that she needs to have her 19th bday dinner here."}
{"text":"Servers were rude and the atmosphere was smelly. This place is a gross tourist trap.Left before ordering."}
{"text":"Staff is great. Food is perfect very convenient hours closest pho and bubble tea around without having too drive downtown"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place. I loved the decor, definitely felt like I was in the1950's....I also liked reading the history of the establishment and that the owners are the original owners from when it first opened in 1958! Unfortunately for me I am allergic to cream....a very horrid affliction.....I can eat the fake whipped in a can cream for some reason with no problems...but give me real tasty cream and it just does not work out.....unfortunately for me but fortunately for most everyone else they serve the REAL deal....so I had to just watch as others devoured this tasty treat....I was able to order a very delicious brownie though that was to die for! It is possibly even tastier if you are able to keep the \"nestled under a mountain of whip cream\" as the menu reads. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the \"Gosh-Awful-Gooey Banana Split\".....and said he even remembers eating here years ago with his parents! An added bonus is the Family Circus Cartoon connection....go check it out!"}
{"text":"While meandering through Scottsdale after discovering all too late that one needs a reservation to go to the Botanical Gardens, a few in my party were desperate for something to tide them over. 

As we passed gallery after gallery, they spotted a Starbucks. We ambled in that direction, at which point I spotted the pink, kitschy ice cream parlor across the street. Deciding it looked a bit out of place for stylish Scottsdale and seeing as the day needed some improvement, I headed over there with my boyfriend while everyone else continued on to their corporate Frappuccinos. 

He and I sit down, order a Dusty Road and a 23 Skiddoo respectively, and waited about 20 minutes for the order. In the meantime, the rest of the party showed up, drinks in hand, intent on maligning us for getting ice cream, but most sinful of all to them, that we were still waiting for it. Our orders come and jaws drop in envy. 

The 23 Skiddoo was all right. Could have done with some fudge or something. It didn't quite click for me as anything really special. 

With the Sugar Bowl it's really all about the atmosphere. You just don't see it anywhere else in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for ice cream.  We hit this place up after we ate a delicious meal at Grimaldi's (review coming soon).

I split a banana split with my girlfriends daughter and we pretty much plowed through it.  It was yum.

There's not much to this place, but it has a cool 50s diner feel to it and there is a game room.  It was pretty damn cold, so bring a jacket.

Good times!"}
{"text":"If you are craving a fancy bowl of Sugar/dessert after a hearty meal welcome to Ice-cream heaven.You just can't miss this building on old town Scottsdale it's Pink Yes PINK, sit at the counter right away or wait to be seated at a table.I'd recommend the counter because they run a tight ship especially after dinner.

We have always tried the ice-cream sundaes so i wouldn't know much about the food.The other tables were also pretty much filled with colorful sundaes and floats,they have an arcade parlor and a gift shop too.

We had the Gosh-Awful-Gooey-banana-Split it totally lived up to its name with the banana's,coffee ice-cream,caramel sauce,strawberry sorbet,marshmallow sauce,whipped cream and cherry.
& Caramel Marshmallow Sundae with Nuts.I loved every bit of it and this place is a must go for all ice-cream lovers."}
{"text":"Nothing really to complain about. Personally, I think this is a better place to go just for a sundae after dinner. The food here is somewhat plain.
The ice cream however, is amazing. My favorite sundaes were the top hat sundae (vanilla ice cream inside a giant cream puff, with chocolate on top), and the dusty road sundae (chocolate ice cream with malt). Most sundaes you can order in half sizes, which is a little bit smaller and a little bit cheaper.
The atmosphere is fun, it's all pink including the outside. It definitely feels like your in a diner or something. There is also a bar thingy with stools that you can sit at rather than a table. Don't forget to check out the game room! I don't think I went there once without playing air hockey with someone.
The service is great, the first time we went, they brought us water twice within the first two minutes! I also remember this one girl was my waitress almost every time I went after that and she was so funny!
The prices are pretty fair in my opinion, the sundaes are really big and hard for a normal person to finish. not for me, however.

On a side note, if you do decide to get the top hat sundae, keep in mind that cutting apart a cold cream puff with a spoon is not the easiest thing in the world. If you accidentally fling a piece of ice cream covered cream puff across the restaurant like I did, try to do it when nobody is walking by."}
{"text":"What can I say!? Cool, retro ice cream shoppe! Been around 60 years and looks like it still boasts the original pink decor! Good ice cream- nothing spectacular but tasty! Nice treat to end my day!"}
{"text":"Sugar Bowl is a local favorite and has some of the most delicious ice cream treats in the valley. It's one of my favorite places to go with friends after a fun dinner out and is located right in the heart of one of the most happening areas in all of the valley- Old Town Scottsdale. Even from the outside, you'll realize that 'cute' is the best word to describe the atmosphere of Sugar Bowl. While it can be crowded at times since it's such a popular place, decorated in all pink with an old diner feel, it's absolutely adorable and perfect for Instagram photos. :) When you open the menu, there are so many options that it can seem slightly overwhelming at first, however, I will assure you that literally anything you order will be delicious and will probably exceed your expectations. If I were to recommend one treat, I'd recommend the Buster Brownie as I've gotten it numerous times and am always impressed with how good it is! However, if you're looking for something a bit simpler, last time I went, their ice cream flavor of the month was cookie dough and it was really, really good. All of their treats are served in very large portions and even the two scoop is pretty large. However, some of the fun of going to Sugar Bowl is sharing with friends! I love this place and would definitely recommend it to other Yelpers looking for a fun place to grab a treat!"}
{"text":"I was gonna say this 4-star review of the Sugar Bowl is kind of for nostalgia's sake, but quite honestly I still think it's a good spot (at least for ice cream...I haven't had the \"regular\" food in forever, but if I remember correctly it's not that good). I mean, yeah the decor is old...and I don't mean \"charming\" (there's rips in the upholstery, chips in the tables, etc...). 

I know most \"old-timey\" ice cream shops make there own ice cream, and the Sugar Bowl doesn't (they serve Dreyer's), but I really don't care. When it comes to \"regular\" sundaes, shakes, ice cream sodas, etc, the Sugar Bowl probably isn't all that much better than any other restaurant/ice cream shop that makes this kind of stuff, but where I'm willing to bump them up a bit is on there \"specialty\" sundaes. There's about 10 of these, and they're all yummy. A few that I can remember trying over the years include the top hat sundae, the creamed walnut fudge sundae (this one is my personal fave) and the buster brownie. Again, these are made w/Dreyer's & I'm sure other run-of-the-mill ingredients, but I don't care. They are delicious!

that staff here always seems to be friendly (I mean...this place caters to kids, so you HAVE to be friendly or at least fake it). I also don't know what it is, but it always seems like there's always young people working here. I mean, like, REALLY young!

At the end of the day though, I still like Sugar Bowl and when I come back to visit AZ I enjoy coming here with my nephew."}
{"text":"Give Austin a raise! What a nice young man. Was doing just about everything - seated us, served us drinks, worked the arcade..."}
{"text":"We stopped at the Sugar Bowl in Scottsdale and had a great time. My brownie sundae was fantastic. I loved the old decor. Definitely worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Growing up in Long Island, NY (and making frequent trips to Brooklyn & Manhattan) I have to honestly say that as far as Old Time Ice Cream Parlors go.... this leaves a lot to be desired.  However, that's not to say that this isn't a gem to be enjoyed.

Old Town Scottsdale on a Sunday afternoon (as I experienced it on vacation last week) is quiet and hot.  There wasn't too much to do and the kids were getting restless.  That being said, it was only 1pm and it was lunch time.  The bright pink building can be seen from quite the distance and certainly stands out on the main road (Scottsdale Rd) in Old Town Scottsdale.  Besides, any place that's been around for 50+ years has merit with me.  

One piece of advice I'd offer is keep it simple.  A burger is an ok order, but stay away from the Reuben.  Should be simple, but somehow...outside of NY... I rarely get one that's worthy of the name.  And this was no exception.  

BIG GRIPE:  No Fries???  They serve potato chips with all their sandwiches, no fries.  Don't get me wrong I like their \"Kettle Chips\" (which aren't made there, but instead probably poured from oversized bags in the back).  But a true old time parlor should have french fries.  Ok, end of gripe.

Now to the ice cream.  I won't comment on how they make it or give a review of all their flavors 'cause frankly I didn't have much.  I had a coffee shake which was quite good actually.  My mother-in-law got the '23 Skiddoo\" that I was eyeing and she was quite happy with it...  It was dutch chocolate ice cream & turkish coffee ice cream, with coffee syrup, sliced almonds, whipped cream & a cherry.  It looked great and got a thumbs up from mom.  My wife ordered a mint chocolate chip sundae (her favorite flavor) and enjoyed it.  The kids... well, the kids are easy to please.  Just stick any ice cream in front of them with some cherries on top and they're happy.

Overall it was a good stop and had fantastic, friendly service. 

The attached arcade left alot to be desired, but it seamed to me to be a cheap add on to a well established parlor."}
{"text":"My aunt took me here after she showed me around Old Town Scottsdale (I was visiting from NJ).

Pros:
-Great location in Scottsdale.
-Loved the cute pink interior; makes the place look like one of those classic, old-fashioned ice cream shops.
-They have a small arcade in the back for the young and young at heart! Cute addition.

Cons:
-Menu is overpriced.
-Ice cream isn't all that great. Very average tasting.

They need to add more appealing specialty ice cream combinations/sundaes to their menu."}
{"text":"Great place for kids. Full menu and fun interior (pink, pink and more pink). There is a game room in the back (arcade), and you can actually sit and eat back there as well. Service was fast and courteous."}
{"text":"The Ice cream was good, the food is subpar at best, the decor is outdated. The readon for the one star rating is the waitresses were standing around and gossiping out loud.  Also, before giving us the check our waitress asked if everything was ok.  I said \"it was ok\".  She did not ask me why, but instead she went over and told the other waitresses.  We heard one of them say \"she said ITS OK!\", then they all laughed.  If this place wants to compete, they need to update everything starting with the staff."}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out!! We always bring our out of town friends to check this place out. The place is very homey and cute. Lots of pink. It reminds me of high school hang outs in the old movies. The ice cream is excellent , yummy and lots of choices and affordable. I can say it is a destination place for tourists.. they have to visit this place if they come to Scottsdale..."}
{"text":"Definitely a must go for the experience. It's a old time ice cream parlor and is always packed during spring training. My favorite thing here is the choose your own sundae. Ice cream is fresh and creamy. You can also get a scoop to go."}
{"text":"Nothing beats a classic sundae and this place does it well! always awesome and always hits the spot, plus, its a landmark and has a great nostalgic feeling."}
{"text":"I had a milk shake from here - delicious 
They get knocked down a peg because we sat at the counter for awhile and had no idea who was helping us - but they also were all working really hard back there!"}
{"text":"Classic sandwich and ice cream place. Been there ever and there is a reason why. Not trying to reinvent anything just good predictable meals or desserts"}
{"text":"Desperate need of some TLC. Went here on a Tuesday afternoon. My mom had an egg salad sandwich and it was completely bland. I had a Reuben with I have no clue what was on top a salad? Coleslaw? Lettuce with mustard? There was minimal sauerkraut and Swiss cheese on the bottom and no 1000 island dressing. To say the least  it was the saddest most pitiful Reuben I've had. My son had some oily bread with half melted cheese on it. Oh and the chips we all had.....I wonder if they are the ones from 1958...again we all almost chipped a tooth. Of course all the desserts were yummy. This is could be so cute as it once was however it needs one hell of a remodel. Especially the bathrooms and children's play center. It has such a great location in Scottsdale and lots of memories for families it's a shame to see that it's gone down hill. To the older gentlemen standing in the corner with his arms crossed with the white hair & glasses. Please stop being creepy standing there staring at everyone.....if you're a manager then manage or help our your staff. I will not be back. 

Please give the sugar bowl the love and attention it needs and deserves!!"}
{"text":"I'm looking at the ratings and seeing they aren't 5 stars across the board and want to know what planet are you on if you don't give this place 5 stars!  Total throwback old school ice cream shop. The kicker is they serve great food too.  
The ice cream sundaes come out so fast you'd swear they had them made already... it was so good I can't even describe it!!  Just go there!! I'd be 500 lbs if I lived nearby!"}
{"text":"Wish it was what I remembered from when I was younger. It's DEFINITELY NOT the same place that it used to be.

I walked in with my family, told the girl, that was just looking at us, that there were 3 and a highchair. That girl looked at us and said, \"so 4.\" Yes, there's a total of 4.

We start to follow her because she starts walking, but not sure if she wanted us to do so, she never said. We walk up to 2 tables and a booth, and one of the bus boys was cleaning one the tables, so I assumed we were going to the one he was just cleaning because the other 2 wouldn't fit a highchair. The girl walks right pass us and doesn't say one word, but she did place the menus on the table at the booth. So I look at my husband and he said I guess we are to sit there.

So we sit down and since there was no room for a highchair, I ask the bus boy, who just finished cleaning the other table, if we could get a booster seat for our daughter (which we don't like to put her in because she is not big enough to sit in a booster seat yet) and he said ok and yelled in Spanish to the girl that, I guess, brought us to our table. Once he yells across the restaurant, I look over at her and she rolled her eyes and made a face. She then noticed that I was looking at her and put a fake smile on her face towards me. So as if I wasn't already annoyed, now I am really frustrated!

The girl walks over, drops off our waters and walks away. I'm watching her walk away because I'm not sure if she understood that it was us that wanted the booster, but I figured that she was just getting our waters first, so I'm telling my irritated/frustrated self to be patient. Our waitress walks up, greets herself (she was the friendliest person in the restaurant) and I ask if they had a kids menu and she says no, I'm sorry we don't. Okay, no worries, we'll figure something out.

The girl finally comes back with the booster seat, which was completely dirty, and doesn't say one word and walks off. (Ok, ok, stay calm)

But I can't! I look at my husband and ask if we can just go somewhere else because I am just done with the horrible customer service. He completely agreed and said that he didn't want to say anything because he knew I really wanted to come here.

I used to love coming here with my parents and siblings when I was younger and now I am just sad that I definitely will not be coming back to this Old Town Scottsdale staple."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting for Spring Training and liked this place so much that we went twice in two nights.  It's a cute place--the desserts are delicious but I don't know about any entrees.  It's pretty crowded most of the time but that'll happen when you're serving yummy ice cream at a good price in an adorable little parlor.

The staff is friendly, too.  I'd go back again in a heartbeat.

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"If Cupid designed a 50s diner I feel like Sugar Bowl could be the result.  Lots of pink and an occasional heart can be found in this cute establishm.  I don't remember the exact name of the dessert I got but there was a brownie and vanilla ice cream on top.  Surprisingly I enjoyed the brownie more than the ice cream.  However, I would order it again in a heartbeat.  There's a game room for kids and kids at heart to play in. I would have but I had no cash to deposit into any of the machines.  If I am walking around old town and have a hankering for ice cream I would definitely walk back into Sugar Bowl's doors"}
{"text":"Was a fun place that my family enjoyed while in Scottsdale. The only reason I gave 4 stars was because they messed up our order a little but nonetheless what we got was really good!! Definitely a place to stop!!"}
{"text":"Love it. 
 
The buildings decor has just the right amount of character and has a neat feel to it. We've only had the desserts but they are perfect. Even if you're still full from dinner, make room for dessert here."}
{"text":"Quality ice cream in a very cute shop! Got a double scoop coffee ice cream cone to go and it was very delicious, perfect treat for a hot summers day!"}
{"text":"Sugar Bowl is an old school diner with the cutest pink diner seats and walls. The diner is really big so it doesn't feel too crowded when it's busy. There are a few arcade games in the back of the diner so there are kids there playing. I really liked the community at Sugar Bowl. It reminds me of tv shows from the 90s when you'll go to the ice cream parlor for an ice cream sundae.

Their ice cream selection is huge and there's so many different options to choose from. I got the Root Beer Float and it was sooo good. The vanilla ice cream was creamy without being too milky. The texture was thick, hard and creamy. My friend ordered a sundae with coffee ice cream and fudge and some other stuff. It was sooo good!! Highly recommend getting dessert if you're in Old Town."}
{"text":"What an adorable place.  This place has an old-time feel, like the soda fountains of the 50's.  We walked in on a week night and the place wasn't too busy.  We sat right at the counter and our order was taken quickly.  My hot fudge and caramel sundae was delicious.  My husband got just a scoop of chocolate and it was equally as good.  This place has table seating too.  This place makes me feel nostalgic.  I've wanted to try this place for so long and I'm glad we did."}
{"text":"I was completely enamored with this place from the moment I saw it! 

My husband and I were walking around Old Historic Scottsdale after a delayed flight in and super late dinner. This little place was a pink retro oasis! I was disappointed that I filled up on dinner because the menu here is like pure food porn with a focus on ice cream. We had to leave early in the morning to drive to some of the National Parks in the area...I made my husband promise we could eat here before our flight back home. He could see my delight and agreed.

We came back a few days later and had both lunch and ice cream. He ordered the Reuben with Cole Slaw and a side of Potato Salad, Cherry Limeaide. Best Reuben I've tasted in a long time, a little different from the traditional but oh-so-good! I had the Vegetable Beef Soup with Tea Sandwiches. Both very good but not as good as what my husband got ;) Service was prompt and the place was clean, including the ladies room.

Now for the ice cream...get a Sundae, Malt, Shake or Banana Sundae. He got the Top Hat Sundae with some sort of Pastry in it that was spectacular, I got a Create-Your-Own Sundae with Strawberry & Chocolate Ice Cream, Pineapple Sauce, Caramel, Whip, Nuts and a Cherry. WOW!!! I can honestly say I'll stop at this place every time I'm in Scottsdale!

I even got one of their logo coffee cups, so darn cute!"}
{"text":"Definitely go for the ice cream.  The food is okay, but the ice cream sundaes were delicious!  The chocolate marshmallow cream was so yummy!  There is a wide variety of ice creams and toppings.  The environment was really cute and the family game room was fun for the kids."}
{"text":"Great quality ice cream and shakes.  I think the atmosphere is also very unique and special.  They are in business now for 60 years!   There can be  a wait time during peak times but if there room at the counter you can go sit yourself immediately."}
{"text":"I've decided to update my review based on the owner responding to my review. I don't take back what I said about it being just okay and sort of the main draw being the cute vintage diner feel but it's clear that this business cares about customer feedback and that says a lot to me...it says they need another star! :)"}
{"text":"Yelpers gave this a 3.5 star rating and I would agree. Not bad, sorta cute old timey feel. But the ice cream itself isn't noteworthy. 

It's not bad and I can see why tourists may stop by, but it's not something I would recommend or a place I would visit more than once. 

The decor is the most charming part. The ice cream leaves a lot of room for improvement. 

Specifically, I had a scoop of vanilla with a berry syrup. The syrup was runny, sugary in a way that seemed store bought, and didn't contain actual berry pieces. The ice cream was served on the melty side and didn't bring much flavor. On top of that, it was almost $5 - not worth it. 

Kids and tourists may not know better, but now you do!"}
{"text":"Very good ice cream Sundays. Would come here again but I would split the Sunday next time (they are big)"}
{"text":"Came here with my fianc√© and our friends after a wine and cheese night, haven't been since I was young, and it was just as good as I remembered it. 

We got a sundae and it was large enough for all four of us to eat, so don't be shy to ask for extra spoons. 

The decor is the same as it has always been, cute and inviting.. definitely recommend coming here for some great Snap's or IG posts, the hype is long lived an real."}
{"text":"Probably the cutest ice cream shop in Scottsdale! Definitely a nice place to stop for some tasty ice cream when walking through old town. I had been here a few times in the past, but decided to make a return visit on Thursday. It was packed! Probably from the art walk, but there was a line out the door. 
The decor is cute, love the old fashioned feel to it. Arcade is cool too, I like that they have that! Would be an awesome place to go with kids. We were not sure who to order our ice cream from because it was so busy, but we were taken care of pretty quickly. I ordered one scoop of mint chocolate chip ice cream in a cone and I certainly enjoyed it! The scoop size was very generous. My one complaint was that the size of the cone wasn't really big enough for the scoop. Just a couple licks and the scoop fell off the cone and somehow I caught it with my hand. Put it back on and continued to enjoy it. 
Will certainly stop here again on my trips to old town!"}
{"text":"Creamy, delicious ice cream in a fun old-fashioned feeling place. The price was right too, with a large single-scoop cone costing about $2."}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to its name ! I originally walked in just for desert but decided to try out one of their menu items. I got just a simple hotdog, but let me try tkh that little hot dog was amazing. I'm weird when it comes to meat but this hotdog was the perfect consistency and the bun was grilled to perfection. I ended up making my own banana split with butter pecan and rocky road with marshmallow sauce on top. Absolutely to die for ! All I have to say is it was crazy good. Also big enough for two people to share. I'd definitely recommend this to a friend."}
{"text":"Been around since my moms time. She has had great memories here and I have too. Historical place but the cutest place on the inside. Great variety of ice cream and such and even good dinner menu or lunch. Must go if you are a tourist. Also a good place to take pics @teens . Either way this place should be on your restaurants to go to before I die."}
{"text":"I feel like a little kid when I go here. I get all warm and fuzzy! i've only had their desserts and I LOOOOOVE them!"}
{"text":"Last night (5/11) my Husband, Son and I stopped in for dessert.  We asked if we could please sit at one of the round tables. We were immediately told no they are for \"5 or more\". The waitress sat us at a  tiny booth with one chair that was jammed into the next table.The person sitting in that chair would not even be able to lift their arm without hitting the next person. My husband went up to see the Mgr to see if we could sit at the round table. He said no, they are for \"4\" or more. My husband told him we would order for four if we could just be comfortable.  He said no and he let us walk out the door. Well goodbye Sugar Bowl.  We are year round residents that have been coming to the Sugar Bowl for many years. There are several very good ice cream parlors in town that we don't have to be treated this way.  Visit Sweet Republic...you'll be comfortable and the ice cream is fabulous."}
{"text":"Sugar bowl ice cream is yummy but what ice cream isn't? let's just say if one day I was craving ice cream, I wouldn't think of coming here specifically for theiiir tubs. Very average stuff.. similar to Breyers/ Dryers. 

What I diiid like was the price, their abundant seating area and location (="}
{"text":"Pour Some SUGAR On Me...



Highly recommended Sugar Bowl for an old fashion ice cream parlor experience. I had the opportunity to stop by and indulge in a \"Buster Brownie\" (extra marshmallow of course) for an inexpensive $5.95. I'll definitely be back during my next visit to Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"When we walked in, it smelled like Swiss Cheese was on the griddle. It stayed that way the entire time...

A few loud birthday celebrations going on. Cool. Its an ice cream shop. 

Our server did not care about what was going on  in the joint. Tried to get some birthday candles in our ice cream, didn't happen. Wasn't our birthday anyhow. Ice Cream was good, not amazing, not awful. 

Do note, if you're coming here expecting sugar bowls on the tables, you will be sorely shocked to find they only have sugar packets..."}
{"text":"For nostalgic purposes only. The ice cream and sundaes are weak and it is looking so grungy and run down these days. Get your sweets fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great, as advertised.
Genuinely old school and definitely worth visiting.
Dusty Road sundae is great (dusted with a generous heap of malt!)

Only had dessert, so can't comment on the food."}
{"text":"This place is charming but I didn't totally get the hype about the food. Our drinks were very good and the interior of this place is very neat, though!"}
{"text":"I try to stop in every time I'm in that part of Arizona. I love the atmosphere & especially their delicious ice cream. My favorite area in Scottsdale is Old Town & after a long day of shopping it's nice to come here to relax & cool off & splurge on something delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's super retro and a great place to hang out. Between three people, we shared the top hat and dusty road sundaes. Both were delicious! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an old fashioned ice cream parlor this is the spot.  The food is also old school diner type food, the meatloaf is pretty good, but it is meatloaf after all, not a porterhouse steak.  The desserts are rich and the ice cream is decent, wish they would have more flavors though.  The servers are mostly young High School age kids who sometime spend too much time talking with their friends.  It is what it is."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed many a cool and sugary treat here on disturbingly hot days while visiting downtown Scottsdale. Old fashioned building, cute vintage interior, it's got the whole \"ice cream parlor\" look down. I sit at the bar and enjoy their luscious milkshakes, sorbet, and banana splits. Very much love this place, and I can back it up with the Thumbs Up I receive from the people I bring here with me."}
{"text":"Solid.  Nothing special, but exactly what you'd expect for an old schoolish diner/ice cream parlor.  Would I drive 45 minutes here again?  No.  Would I go here if in the area?  Yes."}
{"text":"If you have out of town guests visiting, they might enjoy stopping by the Sugar Bowl for a dessert after eating in Old Town.  This place is your classic old school ice cream shop.  The sundaes were large enough to split.  Get the brownie buster... A rich, warm brownie topped with creamy vanilla and hot fudge...only $5.50!"}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was mediocre. I got chocolate ice cream and fudge over a brownie. The brownie was dry and kinda grainy and the ice cream and fudge was really average. I would recommend spending your money someone else."}
{"text":"Now that it's getting hot again, it's time to start thinking of ways to cool off.  Sugar Bowl is definitely an option.  

Sugar Bowl is a cute, pink ice cream parlor that serves up great ice cream, sundaes, shakes and everything in between.  They also serve lunch, but I recommend eating somewhere else and coming here only for dessert.

Their food is okay, they have the basic sandwiches, salads and soups, but it's their ice cream that is really good. And you can always check out the nearby galleries and shops after to help burn off some of those calories you consumed while you were here."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience until today. I gave two stars for the past experiences, because I genuinely love this place. But our waitress today (Angela) was incredibly rude. After she brought our order, she didn't check back in or ask if we needed anything, she just brought our check. A few minutes after she brought our check, she asked if we needed anything, to which we replied no. She then she \"Oh. Well you were like looking at us.\" A few minutes later she came back and said \"have you guys paid yet? You need to go pay. I guess you can keep sitting here but you need to go pay.\" The restaurant was not especially busy, there was no wait and plenty of open tables. We weren't taking up the place of a waiting party. We'd probably been there for half an hour, so not an incredibly long time. I'm just shocked at how rude she was."}
{"text":"Definitely a place I'll be visiting on my next cheat day. I really enjoy brownies and the \"Buster Brownie\" was awesome. I like the addition of the marshmallow. Service was good, loved the environment and setting. Definitely will become #1 dessert spot."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Mediocre food. We literally spent 2.5 hours here just trying to have lunch. It became a case of weighing how much time we had already invested vs. 'should we just get up and leave.' We should have left. By the time we were done, most of the nearby shops had closed. I don't know what took so long, as the sandwiches were on par with something a 5-year-old could have slapped together -- white bread, mayo, luncheon meat, iceberg lettuce. Our waitress  failed to bring salad dressing after two requests, so I went up front to get it myself. A bus girl said she would bring it. When she failed to, I went up front yet again and this time waited for her to bring it out of the kitchen. This experience has taught me to always check the yelp review first, not an hour into a bewilderingly bad experience."}
{"text":"Our server was really friendly and made small talk with our group, and the ice cream was definitely a plus since its extremely hot outside (even at night). Not much to say from a tourist except that it's a really cute place to go.
I would recommend going here, and I'm not even the type of person that likes to leave the house."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meals and dessert.  I had turkey club. It was standard and very good. The lemonade was actually really good. The waitress was unbelievable. The dessert was excellent. I had cookie dough ice cream with hot fudge. It was outstanding. I tried some of my wife's brownie sundae and it tasted great.  I am not really an ice cream person, but really enjoyed the ice cream. The price point was perfect."}
{"text":"Had your typical scoop of ice cream on a cone - it was delicious! They are very generous with their scoops and have friendly service!"}
{"text":"Despite being seated in the back room with no other customers and needing to hunt down our waitress, the banana split was a sumptuous delight!  The red raspberry sorbet was delicious! The banana was fresh and sweet. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"We love the ice cream here, but can only split something between myself, my husband and my daughter - it's too rich and big.  We had an entertainment coupon for \"buy a menu item, get a menu item free\" so this time my daughter and I decided to split a grilled cheese and a sundae.  In the past I've tried their food and haven't found anything I like other than their banana bread but this time was different.  

We ordered the swiss cheese version of the sandwich and their Desireme Banana Split (bananas, vanilla ic with choc sauce, strawberry ic with strawberries, whip and a cherry).  They brought out 2 plates of 1/2 sandwich, chips and a pickle - thoughtful touch.  The sandwich was crisp and golden, melty cheese stringing from each yummy bite (but then again it's just bread and cheese grilled).  The split was scrumptious, creamy, rich and perfect to share.  My daughter had the all-too familiar \"sugar-drunk\" glaze to her eyes and said \"Thanks mom, that was delicious!\"

The bill was only $7 something, so we left a nice tip.  The wait staff was really friendly.  The interior looked upgraded a bit on this visit.  

The place was filled with older couples sipping old tyme soda floats or malts and holding hands - very nostalgic and romantic (OK, there were 2 but that seems like a lot).  FUN!"}
{"text":"Great service, 50's diner atmosphere, and the vanilla ice cream is amazing.  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"YUMMMM! I loved the old school ice cream parlor look.  It makes you feel like you are in the heart of old town and have disappeared for a second.  The hardest part... choosing a item on the menu.

The staff was really great too and there is reservations for groups."}
{"text":"I agree with Kristen E. when it comes to reviewing the ice cream.  It's ICE CREAM! And this place is ridiculously cute and nostalgic and a PERFECT date place.  I always sit at the counter, I feel like a kid or something.  As far as price, unless you're buying a pint at Bashas' you're spending this kind of money anywhere you go.  SOOOOOOOOO CUTE! love it.  

I cannot speak for their food and this is not the primary reason to enter the doors at a place called SUGAR bowl :)"}
{"text":"Although I've lived in Phoenix for quite some time, I went to Sugar Bowl for this first time and ordered a couple dishes! Overall, I had a great time. The ambiance is a perfect fit in Old Town Scottsdale and I loved that the audience varied between young and old. We went on a Thursday night and it was a little busy so the order and wait time took a little long, but the ice cream was worth it.

23 SKIDDOO: The coffee and chocolate paradise this ice cream created was incredible. The coffee ice cream was great because it wasn't too sweet and had a nice creamy flavor. I also thought the chocolate syrup was delicious and I enjoyed how all the ingredients were layered. There also was a decent amount of almonds present and it was more than I realized, but it was great.

Small Sundae: My friend was a little plain, but got the vanilla ice cream and caramel marshmallow topping. They layered the sundae so that the caramel was at the bottom but I would recommend eating it mixed together because the caramel is sweet and thick.

Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a bite to eat after a show downtown Scottsdale. This place looked like  fun. Asked to be seated in the play room looked like fun for a girls night out. Ordered food.  The chicken sandwich was so dry it was hard to chew.  We had the \"famous bread\" not sure what make it famous three of us tried it it was so dry, the chips were even stail.  The ice cream is the ONLY thing that was good, unless you got the cream puff ice cream  which was more like a roll and not a puff.  Most of the games didn't even work. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Cute 50s-style shop, a little rundown, with friendly service and a convenient location. Ice cream was so-so, not super flavorful, not a delicious small-batch place like sweet rose in LA or humphry slocombe in SF. Attached to a little arcade area on one side."}
{"text":"Nice little shop to stop and and have a bit of ice cream.  Great place to bring family and friends when they are in town."}
{"text":"A little Ice Cream Shoppe in Historic Downtown Scottsdale. The decor is super cute. Warning, it is super packed with people all the time. That should tell you how awesome there ice cream concoctions are. My daughters had an obscene amount chocolate drizzled over their heaps of ice cream and their brownies were hot fluffy pillows of delight.  Their banana splits are definitely illegal. Nothing that good should be legal. Where prices are concerned, you get more here for your buck!"}
{"text":"Great historic place that looks like it has never changed since it opened. In a good way.  Good was good and well priced. Service was quick. If you are in old town you should try this place. Local or tourist should check it out."}
{"text":"I heard about this place so I had to come visit. It's real cute very old fashioned looking 50s style, very homey and clean. The ice cream is real good (never had any actually food) and the wait staff is very very nice. Def a good visit."}
{"text":"The Sugar Bowl is a Scottsdale tradition, a sort of ice cream parlor/dessert diner which, according to the Family Circus cartoons framed on the wall and the delicate pink chairs and plush pink round booths, is a place for daddy to take his little girl.  The pink framed arcade in the back room has air hockey, skee-ball, and everything nice.  

I may be more Amelia Bedelia/Mary Poppins in age than Jane and Michael Banks, but I still go crazy for ice cream, as well as beautifully illustrated 60s influenced napkins and late 50s influenced parlors.  The young dude that waited on my table was courteous and didn't respond to my super hard to read blandishment attempts (plus Scottsdale is stocked with titillating women to the average heterosexual man) or mind that I was the only one getting something.  

I tried the Mocha Chocolate shake which was rich, flavorful, and seemingly made with care or at least higher quality ice cream than the milk shake I'm used to.  It was a worthy experience in Scottsdale, but it was not \"fancy schmancy.\""}
{"text":"The staff need to do some training courses on customer service!!!  

Neat atmosphere and over all good Ice cream.  

*We ordered a mint choc chip CONE -
Got a mint choc chip scoop.  

*Ordered a choc chip scoop - got a MINT choc chip scoop.

*Ordered a choc chip shake - got a
MINT choc chip shake!

*Ordered a root beer float to share with four people - got ONE spoon, NO STRAWS!

Asked for straws - got a fist full!!!  

We didn't complain about the mint shake since we are adults and it was good.  

We did have them correct the scoop to a cone tho for a child. 
 
Then they charged us for the extra scoop!

They changed it but not till after I told her she could have the extra scoop-since it was uneaten...I knew they could not take it back per health code.  

They did fix it.  HOWEVER, This place could be over the top but the service just is not good for the price!!

I beg you all...PLEASE FIX THE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  You will be out of business...there are too many great places to go...the value of a dollar is so important and I'm just not gonna WASTE it on a place that has POOR SERVICE!
 Step it up!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's an ice cream parlor from the 50's which hasn't changed at all.

Take that at face value, both in terms of the vibe of the place as well as the visible wear & tear on it.  Family who live out there have confirmed that nothing much has changed through the years.

I got a chocolate malt.  It was absolutely a malt.  Nothing special or noteworthy about it, but it wasn't bad at all.  I wasn't asking for a revelation."}
{"text":"Old school ice cream parlor! We have had only had ice cream here and it's been great!"}
{"text":"Very cute place, all decked in pink. It's a great place to stop by for a treat. We walked by the first time and was intrigued by the pink as well as arcade games inside. We decided to come back to eat after our lunch to see what's it all about. Seems to be a popular place for tourists and locals alike. 

We ordered the Desire Me Banana Split- vanilla and strawberry ice cream banana split, with hot fudge and whip cream. It was divine. The strawberry ice cream was my favorite, made with big chunks of ice cream. Total was $6, not bad for 2 people to share.

Loved the arcade game, good for adults and children alike ;)"}
{"text":"We were seated immediately and served complimentary ice cold water on a hot day! Our ice cream orders were served to us within 5 minutes. It was all delicious, the service was fast and great and the ice cream was delicious. Try the raspberry sorbet!"}
{"text":"This place is  exactly what I imagine a date night would be like in 1945! 

My fiance and I decided to indulge in our sweet tooths (teeth?) one gorgeous Scottsdale evening and wandered into Sugar Bowl.

Holy slice of Americana! This place has been around forever (as evident by the worn booths and chairs). We each indulged in a scoop of ice cream while enjoying each other's company and the pink retro decor. 

Fun fact: There's lots of Family Circus references throughout the place..the author often used Sugar Bowl as the premier ice cream spot in the comic - who knew?!

I'd love to return next time to try the egg salad sandwich.. oh and of course something sweet!  ;-)"}
{"text":"Cutest ice cream shop ever! Everything on thier menu is phenomenal.  The service was gteat and the staff is super bubbly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I want to make love to a cream puff sundae.  Maybe even marry one.  They're that good.  Other than totally awesome desserts, this pace is a dump. The g-damn flickering fluorescent lights give me a headache.

Go there for dessert, inhale it before the flickering lights give you a seizure then run before you get sucked into a shit-hole linoleum time-warp."}
{"text":"Amazing! Top 2 Sundaes- 1. Buster Brownie and 2. Dusty Road Sundae. You won't want anything else! :)"}
{"text":"San Francisco newspaper recommended Sugar Bowl. The workers were rude, the selection of ice cream was minimal and the ice cream quality itself was more water than cream. Worst ice cream I've had in a long time ."}
{"text":"I grew up in Phoenix and my daddy took me to the Sugar Bowl for ice cream every few months or so, for years starting about age 5 when we first moved there and lived in a motel down the street for a while until we found a house.  

I loved pink as a girl and this place had that, in spades. 

I liked hot fudge sundaes. Dad used to say it wasn't as good at Mary Coyle's ( I don't know how to spell that) which closed for a while in the 70's I think,and then came back \"wrong\" ( like Buffy) , but it was a good runner up. 

I didn't care, it was ice cream, and it was good. Ice cream in Arizona is ESPECIALLY good. It's freaking hot there all the time, which makes you appreciate cold yumminess even more.

Maybe it's a little outdated, but it's still sweet."}
{"text":"The manger with glasses very rude and and unfriendly
The food was terrible the turkey  had no taste and dry
The roast beef for my kids was of no taste not edible
And my son could not drink milk shake in the area to watch our twin girls even though their are seats to eat and drink
Ask for a refund and he said no  you-deal with the waitress
Who was by the way sweet
Since he took over the place has gone downhill
It was a nice place but my friends and family won't be returning ever again."}
{"text":"Great service with lots of menu options. Had no idea sugar bowl had been around for as many as 60 years. The hot fudge sundaes are to die for as I'm sure everything else on the menu is. One of my favorite gelato places in old town was closed due to limited summer hours do I ended up going to sugar bowl and I'm glad I did and I soaked up a little history along with it!"}
{"text":"Their malts are amazing! Went here with my dad and niece to have some ice cream. My dad order a banana split and said it was great, I ordered a vanilla malt, it was delicious!  The only negative is that they don't serve fries....even though they serve hamburgers, I was disappointed because I wanted to dip some fries in my shake lol but other than that it's a nice place to go with the family!"}
{"text":"Roach issue?

I use to like it, but now I may never go back. My girlfriend introduced me to Sugar Bowl less than a year ago and since then I have been back maybe eight times. Sugar Bowl became a place where whenever i was hanging out with someone in Old Town Scottsdale we would stop and get some ice cream; even with a bunch of guys. I think the ice cream is different, good, and well priced. (I've never had their meals) The place was always packed on weekends but overall worth the short wait.

A few months ago a couple of friends and I stopped in around 7-8pm on a Saturday to get some ice cream to end the night and unwind. We were seated in a both to the far right end of the shop. While we were eating I noticed a bug on the wall but didn't want to mention it to my friends as to not ruin the ice cream for them. Well a couple minutes later the a small cock roach starting crawling towards my friend neck and my other friend spotted it. It was gross to see but we didn't mind until the roach kept coming closer and closer to my friend. He had to kill it with a napkin... Then another roach popped up so we decided to move to another table. After looking around we began to see that the inside of this place isnt maintained very well, the walls look dirty and everything has a kind of dust on it.

I don't know if I'll be going back there again. I like the ice cream but if the front has a roach issue I cant imagine what the kitchen looks like. I feel bad for saying this since it seems like a Scottsdale staple. I still gave it 3-stars because the ice cream is good."}
{"text":"Went here for a post-dinner dessert after seeing ti was one of the top 10 attractions in Old Town (according to one of the newspaper clippings attached to a signpost).  It was just okay.  Got a banana split and although it wasn't bad, it wasn't worth going out of my way for.  I personally think that it's so popular based on the nostalgia factor of people remembering coming here as kids.  If you've got some time to kill and want ice cream, this is a nice little shop.  But by no means would I say it's worth going out of your way to come here like I did."}
{"text":"I used their restrooms for the first time last week, and, my love affair with Sugar Bowl ended long before I finished what clearly was my last bowl of their banana split.

NOTHING can make me go back to an establishment that unabashedly displays their lack of concern for hygiene."}
{"text":"A Scottsdale classic. Featured in Family Circus and a staple since 1958 for locals and visitors alike, the Sugar Bowl is a must for anyone who wants to take a trip back in time. Enjoy some traditional cooking, a treat from the fountain and and maybe have some candy on the side.

Do be aware that the menu is solid, yet basic. No celebrity chef here. The ice cream is not hand crafted with a hint of lavender. If that's what you're looking for, go elsewhere. But if you want to experience Scottsdale much like it was in 1958, the Sugar Bowl is perfect for you.

The decor is, well, 1958, as it should be. So is the menu for the most part. Stop in and enjoy a classic a meal or classic fountain treat. Another plus, prices are pretty reasonable, at least compared to much of the rest of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Service was quick (which boyfriend loves)  and we got our ice creams, it was on point. I love how pink and girly this place is :) 

We came here after dinner, to continue our date night. We had one scoop of peppermint and one scoop of mint chocolate chip ice cream.. heaven in my mouth   you just can't go wrong with chocolate chip. Yummmm my favorite.  The peppermint was too sweet for me. So I had my boyfriend kill it. Haha.

I love this place."}
{"text":"Solid Pho spot. The bowl of Pho (Vietnamese Soup) is about medium size and comes with the standard accompanying plate of garnishes: Thai basil leaf, bean sprouts, and a wedge of lime. I promise you the broth i had is certifiable. Not a hint of msg. Very very clean and good. I really enjoyed it. Beef slices (traditionally served rare) were fresh. 

My boyfriend and I had a selection of appetizers and our constructive suggestion would be to have different accompanying sauces for the apps. We ordered spring rolls, fresh rolls, and grilled chicken skewers and they all had the same  sweet chili sauce. Offering the traditional peanut sauce for the fresh roll or satay sauce for the chicken would be yum.

This spot is cute and clean. They offer adorable little confections in their bakery display. Bf got me some adorable macarons, but they also have some cookies and cakes on the menu. We'll try those next.

Boyfriend had a Bahn Mi Ga and everything inside the sandwich was great. He loved it. The baguette is not the usual type served at other Vietnamese spots. At $6 it's a bit smaller but this sandwich is good, toasted, pickles and all. We paired our meal with their Thai tea and Thai coffee. We left happy.

They have a selection of boba teas on the menu. Kids love that stuff. 

I'm so glad Pho is here. If you've read my New Wong review, this is what we've needed, especially come winter. I like to wish out loud! Service is genuinely nice and warm. Especially the bakery lady and the cashier. Come give the soup a try!"}
{"text":"Nice bowl of pho. Broth is flavorful and not too oily. Service is friendly and the atmosphere is homey."}
{"text":"The gigantic pink building.  We stopped in this place for some ice cream one afternoon.  Its old school and has stools at the counter. Like an old fashioned soda fountain.   I got a walnut fudge sundae and my buddy got a banana split.  My sundae was pretty good.  Just the right amount of ice cream and toppings.  Everyone we encountered was nice and friendly.  A tad steep.  $15 bucks for ice cream but it was good enough."}
{"text":"I've lived in AZ for 26 years and never been here before. Wasn't outstanding but ok. Got the bittersweet chocolate sundae with one scoop of mint chocolate chip ice cream. Didn't taste bittersweet. Better places to go than this place. Like Sweet Republic."}
{"text":"The event seems as if passed in another lifetime, yet simultaneously, I recall it as if it were only but a moment ago.

Clear as ever, it haunts my reverie and dashes my tourist-y vintage soda shop dreams to smithereens... nothing more than ancient affections, now turned to dust.

What could possibly tarnish my fond childhood recollections of the Sugar Bowl?

Him. He sat there, idle, fondling a morsel of something. Suddenly, he was off... advancing towards the counter at lightning speed, straight towards my prized possession. 

He approached it without hesitation, and before I knew it, a cockroach had crawled up my sundae.

'Tis better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.... save for when you unknowingly loved something infested with cockroaches. Then, it becomes debatable."}
{"text":"Very family-friendly; one area of the restaurant is kid-oriented. Service was fast and friendly and the prices reasonable. Delicious ice cream."}
{"text":"This place is frozen in time and reminds me of every awesome diner and ice cream shop I remember as a kid. Including a game room in the back for the grands been here multiple times and I would not say the food is great but the ice cream is amazing. They know how to make a Sunday and the are awesome. Club sandwich and chef salad are tasty but would avoid the burger."}
{"text":"I did not try the ice cream. But I give this place three solid stars for vintage charm. I can see how people might think it's overrated, but I would really love to do a vintage theme photo shoot in here sometime.  Truly old-school furniture, but not in too much of a kitschy way."}
{"text":"We are in Scottsdale with the grandkids and a friend recommended this place. If you have a sweet tooth this is the place to go for old fashioned desserts. Otherwise the burgers and sandwiches are nothing exceptional. The homemade chicken soup had one chunk of chicken in it and was mostly potatoes. The pie and cheesecake are not from an old family recipe either. Good for the novelty of an old fashioned ice cream parlor... Waitress and staff were very friendly and service was fast."}
{"text":"This place is so darned cute inside and out! The pale pink leather booths are so chic and vintage--it's absolutely adorable. 

We were there pretty late at night and they were still reasonably busy, but we had very attentive service. I split a Brownie Buster Sundae (with added hot fudge) with my friend. They have a lot of ice cream options, many pretty old-school with ingredients you don't see everyday, like marshmallow sauce. Our sundae was huge and absolutely scrumptious. True, it was a bit pricey but it was plenty big to split and so dang good!

I was a little disappointed not to find french fries on the menu, but really I'd give those up to know they were sticking to their retro menu with more unique sides like cottage cheese and potato salad. In all, I had a wonderful time here and would go back in a heart beat! Great for any occasion."}
{"text":"The ice cream is good but the overpowering smell of urine is disgusting."}
{"text":"I always loved going to Sugar Bowl.  Changed the mint chip, not as good.  Go back to the original.  Chocolate shake and chocolate chip still good."}
{"text":"Was just curious about the place since its been running since 1950's. Its where you get your typical sundaes and ice cream. If you like gelato this is not the place for you. The theme is cute if you like the old ice cream parlor look. Sundae list is extensive and would get only a small size if you have an average appetite. We tried the hot fudge and caramel sundae and they were ok. The top hat has bread and didn't like it so much. Service was good and the staff was attentive."}
{"text":"Very throwback atmosphere; vintage ice cream parlor.  Nice place to cool off; especially when it is 115 degrees outside!"}
{"text":"Came here for something sweet and ordered a brownie with a scoop of chocolate ice cream. The brownie was fluffy and chewy but think it would have been better heated up!"}
{"text":"This place is a sugary dairy lover's dream.  Unfortunately, if you DON'T eat dairy and want a treat, you have few options, and only 1 in the ice cream department.  Only their Raspberry sorbet is dairy free.  They do a Raspberry / Sprite shake that's pretty good, but at $4.95, it's not that great.  I would MUCH rather stroll down Scottsdale Rd. to Green for one of their famous Soynami's... If I ate dairy, this place would be a 5-star spot easy..... I could see myself literally overdosing on sweet here.  Old school vibe, old school treats."}
{"text":"The Sugarbowl was not as great as I thought it would be.  I had the turkey salad sandwich which was ok. My friends had the turkey sandwich and cheeseburger. Both said they were pretty good.  Then came the desserts. The carmel and chocolate sundaes were ok but nothing spectacular.  The buster brownie was a bust. The brownie was not warmed up and was hard.  I like the nostalgia of the place but I will not be back."}
{"text":"OK place, and Lake County could use more Vietnamese choices. We tried only the banh mi. Small, as other reviewers have said. Ours, though, were also bland. I found just one or two slices of jalape√±o; I thought the mayo was put on too thick.

The pastry selection is tiny and nothing tempted us."}
{"text":"Very mediocre place. Mediocre desserts and building was old and kind of creepy. Ordered the Ooey Gooey dessert and nothing special about it at all. It was like my 3 year old son made it."}
{"text":"So many delicious options, and the ice cream is egg free which is amazing for us with an egg allergic child. Wife and I shared a coffee ice cream while the kids had strawberry ice cream and demanded a return visit. Service was friendly, rapid, and unobtrusive. We were only in Scottsdale for two days, and we were at the Sugar Bowl twice!"}
{"text":"So after eating a seriously mediocre meal at Roaring Fork for the BF's birthday, we decided to get dessert here. This place is crazy looking... all pink and old school. I wouldn't say it's nice.... it's kitschy. We ordered the tin roof (vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and peanuts). Well it came out.... but didn't have any whipped cream. Come to find out they are out of whipped cream.... well that sucks for an ice cream place. And again birthday fail. But the ice cream was good, especially in combo with the peanuts, but nothing super special. The vanilla did have little black dots in it, which I think is important to vanilla ice cream in my opinion. Well... the BF liked it, so that's what matters."}
{"text":"this place just looks super cute. has that old town feel but not really worth going to unless you are grabbing some desert to go.

came here for lunch a few months ago..not impressed with the food. with so many places to go around old town, i would say skip the food. nothing special.

the service is also very ehhh

it's more of a to-go dessert place if you are craving a sundae!  they have a decent selection of ice cream but it's very rich and a pint of ben and jerrys or haagen daaz will probably satisfy your craving (for cheaper too)"}
{"text":"We ended the evening here with a scoop of raspberry sorbet, delish! Prices are cheap. Quality is huge and fun atmosphere. Great fun for all!"}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a kid. It's a classic Old Town Scottsdale landmark. 50's style,walls covered in Family Circus cartoons. The Dusty Road Sundae is the BEST!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with ice cream. in fact I've never had bad ice cream before. This place has been here as long as I can remember and I still take my wife here for date night because it is awesome!"}
{"text":"Funny thing. When you peruse all of Yelps \"non recommended\" reviews for this place - most of them are pretty bad, and all say the same thing. 
Lousy service (check)
In attentive /rude/uncaring staff (check again)
Dirty menus and establishment (ewwww)
Sub par ice cream and food (yup)
A sense of disarray and no organization (saw it)
I think the only thing this establishment has going for it it's kitchy pink decor, history in Old Town and the long ago reviews of \"the way things used to be\"...apparently you can only ride that for so long. This place is just awful now. Too bad. Bill Keene would be disappointed....
Even the owner himself was unfriendly. Shame."}
{"text":"The place has an old time feel with the historic references to the Family Circus comic strip. We brought in-laws here from out of state. They enjoyed the ambiance and the novelty sundaes. You could tell this, as well as the rest of old town Scottsdale is a tourist trap. It was easy to tell the locals from the tourists as a dust storm blew in. The place practically cleared out with cameras clicking and videos rolling to capture this common local event. At some point they filtered back in to finish their half melted ice cream treats. I have to say as a local I will only return with out of towners who appreciate the novelty of the place. It is just your average ice cream shop."}
{"text":"Quaint old school diner and ice cream shoppe in Old Town Scottsdale. I think the major draw of this place is its old school charm and decor. Three of us shared a sundae and their home made pumpkin ice cream. Prices were fair and the pumpkin ice cream was delicious. It's on the main drag so it was filled with lots of people...it was an interesting mix of people ranging from under 21 on their dates or friend dates to the over 30 crowd...to the cougars in fishnet stockings hanging out at the bar (Not even kidding). Ha!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise this turned out to be! Willoughby needs more variety and the Sugar Bowl is a great addition to the city's dining options for Asian food.

My girlfriend loves Vietnamese food, so when she saw that the restaurant was open, both of us were eager to try it out. It's a small place with only a few tables, but we were in the mood to stay home and watch a movie, so we ordered carry out. Both of us ordered B√°nh m√¨ sandwiches, and we decided to try the scallion pancakes, and the wrapped shrimp rolls. The bakery looked really fun, so we ordered some macarons as well.

Our order was ready in about 10 minutes and by that time the place got busy. It was about 8:00 and about four couples had come in and a couple more people were seated at tables. The atmosphere is simple, bright, and cheery. There's a counter with bar seats that extends the length of the window front, and the small tables seat two. While you're waiting for you food, there is padded bench seating along one wall. It's a tight fit, but not claustrophobic.

My car smelled so good during the ride home and we couldn't wait to tear into our dinner. The B√°nh m√¨ sandwiches were a little on the small side, but very flavorful. The cilantro and jalape√±o combination made the chicken pop and the dressing was a sweet addition. We snacked on the crispy scallion pancakes, which were also very flavorful and came with a dark ginger-like dipping sauce. The rolls were fresh and crispy, though the light golden sauce they came with was quite pungent and not to our liking.

The macarons were a delightful dessert, especially the watermelon flavored ones. They didn't taste artificial and had a little tartness to them. The emoji macarons were sweet and flavorful. We had ordered the panda cookies, but they got the order wrong, which we didn't discover until we got home. That was the only disappointment to this meal.

The sandwiches, rolls, and scallion pancakes were $22.00, which we thought was a decent value for a good meal like this. I guarantee we'll be back soon to try the pho and other menu items."}
{"text":"Blast from the past, journey back in time for an old fashioned fountain and luncheonette. Reasonable prices added to the nostalgia. Limeade with real lime!  A small hot fudge sundae that was the perfect size. A Scoop of sherbet. We just went in for a mid-day refreshment. Otherwise I might have ordered the jello with potato chips and finger sandwiches.  A real menu item at the Sugar Bowl, Scottsdale, no kidding."}
{"text":"I can't deny, I kind of love the classic ice cream parlor.  This is where you go to get some old world charm.  A Root Beer Float spilling over the slide of your glass or a Pinnacle Peak Sundae will really make your day.  When its hot, just hang out inside, the service is really cute and any little kids in your crew will love it.

Give an old fashioned chocolate or strawberry shake a try.  They accurately describe them as: \"luscious and irresistible\""}
{"text":"I walked in here after enjoying a cold beer and a cheeseburger, and had almost zero expectations.  I was well-attended by the friendly staff, who walked me through the menu, and I found myself ordering what they call a Camelback soda.  Basically you can choose any scoop of ice cream, club soda, and any syrup of your choosing to customize it to perfection.  I highly recommend ordering that on a hot day."}
{"text":"Hello all!! Happy Summer 
It's time for some ice-cream!! 
My family & I came here to celebrate my bday (yea!! ). We ate lunch & indulged in some creamy treats. 
I highly recommend the, Bicado! - (yep, that's how it's spelled & punctuated on the menu ). They carve their own turkey breasts & make a cold turkey salad with it (similar to cold chicken salad-but better). It was a nice light menu option before going crazy on my ice-cream. We had a shake, sundae & a few banana-splits at the table. All divine!! The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is the wait-service. I felt the wait staff could have been a bit more welcoming & upbeat; especially, for a pricey place to celebrate special occasions.  If you're looking for a cute & fun place to celebrate with ice-cream - this is it!! Consider the time of day & week. We came at 2pm on a Saturday & it was busy!!"}
{"text":"Ice cream was good. There aren't too many old school ice cream parlors anymore that serve just the basics."}
{"text":"Recommend to anyone looking for authentic pho, it was perfect!  The macaron cookies were delicious, too."}
{"text":"I had buster with fudge without whipped cream and it was super good. One of the best dessert places I have been in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"The ice cream here is delicious, but the service is horrendous. There always seems to be 10+ people working here, yet they often seemed annoyed to have patrons. 

This place is adorable, and has deep roots in old Az. Come on, Sugar Bowl, step it up a little."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star I would this place is horrible first of we waited 35 min for 2 hot dogs and a cold roast beef sandwich and chips when the food came to the table my son took a bit and spit it back out he lifted the bread and the roast beef was gray we called the waitress over to the table and told her she asked if he wanted them to remake the sandwich he said no just take it back he wasn't hungry and more then we started to feed my granddaughter her hot dog and chips and noticed little black hairs almost like hair from a beard on like half of the chips I then called over the manager and explained all of this to  he asked if we wanted more food or just the bill yes that's right folk's he wants me to pay for gray meat and hairy chips this place is definitely not a good place to eat anything"}
{"text":"My Grandma used to take me here as a kid when she wanted to do something more \"special\" than Swensen's or Farrell's (anyone else remember them?).  In my childhood memories all that I vividly remembered was pink, more pink and they served huge things of ice cream.  

When deciding where to take a very special 10 year old girl for her birthday with her \"grown-up friends\", I figured that was a great place.  3 adults, only I had been there before and that was as a kid, and a kid. We got there early, asked what they could do for birthdays and they will put a candle in their desert and bring it over.  I LOVED that they would do a little something without obnoxious clapping or loud singing.  

Atmosphere: Childhood memories were correct.  It's pink.  Not quite as pink as I remembered, but the 10yr old loved the pink booths and walls.  Perfect.  Has some tight areas for seating if they were packed, but we didn't have any trouble hearing each other.  And yea - this place was popular w/ the over 60 crowd.  Then again - this place has been in business for 48 years so I'll just think of them as \"the regulars\".  

Menu: Their menu folds out to be 4 long pages.  Only the first one is \"food\" the rest is \"sweets\".  Mmmm...  Our table tried their soup, Chicken sandwich, Bacon Burger and Patty melt. While several folks were disappointed that they didn't serve fries, the potato salad was pretty good.  We all agreed that the food was quite good for the price and while not as large portions as you might get other places - it left just enough room for ice cream.  Perfect planning.  My friend was very impressed with the chicken sandwich.  She said it was one of the most moist and juicy pieces of chicken she'd had in a long time.  And while none of us got them - they have a pretty large (and retro) section of Light and low calorie food.  Tea sandwiches, cottage cheese with fruit, their \"famous\" nut bread w/ butter or cream cheese and pineapple, and so many other fun selections that I'm SURE my Grandma ate when we used to go there long ago. 

It's pretty hard to screw up ice cream - let's be honest.  We all decided to go with one of their specials vs. trying to put together something ourselves.  Our table got their Buster brownie (Warm brownie on cloud of Marshmallow cream topped w/ vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.), the Sugar Bowl Banana split (Scoop of chocolate, scoop of strawberry, banana and I think strawberry and caramel syrups w/ whip cream), and the 26 Skidoo (Layered in a narrow glass from bottom up - chocolate sauce, coffee ice cream, coffee syrup w almonds, chocolate ice cream, whipped cream).  The 10 year old dug into hers with the usual 10 year old fervor, but even more so once she'd had a bite.  Mom said next time they will NOT be sharing!  The table agreed that their chocolate ice cream was amazing all by itself.  A great dutch chocolate flavor vs. trying to be fudgy sweet.  Hardly a word was said by the banana split girl. She was quite focused on the plate in front of her.  When we looked at her she would just nod and make an \"Mmmm Hmmm\" which we understood as \"Yes, this really is that good and no I'm not going to stop to tell you about it\"

Service: They remembered, an hour and a half later, to bring out the candle in the desert without having to be reminded.  They put up with the 10 year old's questions and having to repeat the answers several times - all with a smile.  They happily took the substitutions we requested.  And while we were took up a table for almost 3 hours (She eats slow) they never once made us feel rushed.  

End result?  We all had a great time.  We've decided that we will definitely find fun reasons to go back - with or without the kid as an excuse.  We all found tons of things we'd love to try - or maybe even eat again.  My suggestion - take a child because ice cream is always better though a their eyes or even better - take your Grandma, because at any age there is absolutely nothing better than ice cream with Grandma."}
{"text":"Stopped by here after lunch. Such a cute place! Luckily it wasn't busy, so we got our sundaes really quickly. I got one with cookies and cream ice cream and it was amazing of course. Really friendly service also."}
{"text":"Why isn't the Sugar Bowl open later?  Why can I never grasp exactly when it's open...and often find myself driving by, looking for a Sundae...only to see the shop's windows dark?

I really enjoy the bubblegum pink theme of the entire place.  It's really adorable.

The ice cream creations are delicious (it's just hard to choose which one to get!)

Last time I went there were a lot (a lot) of junior high-young high school aged kids there...they were pretty loud and monopolizing of the wait staff.  However, I guess I remember thinking how great it was to drive out to the Sugar Bowl when I was that age...and it's one of the few places in Old Town that isn't a bar (and thus not carding after 7pm)."}
{"text":"This place has been recommended to me by family and friends so many times. As an Arizona native, I'm ashamed that I hadn't been here sooner. It took a friend coming into town to get me to go and I'm so glad I did.

The fact that they have Family Circus cartoons everywhere really made me smile. I wasn't aware that Bil Keane had so many cartoons centered around the Sugar Bowl. I absolutely love that old time pink and white decor too. It's as if time has stood still and with so much being renovated in the area, it's great to be reminded of a time in Arizona that's long gone. 

I got a rootbear float which was fantastic. The ice cream was plenty and the way it melted in the float made it super thick and luscious. They have an old school ski-ball machine that's bright pink and reminicent of sometime between 1980-1989. :)

I found out their orange sherbet has dairy in it but the raspberry sorbet does not, just in case there's anyone out there with the sad misfortune of not being able to eat dairy at an ice cream parlor."}
{"text":"Sugar high? Sugar coma? Sugar fix? Get all 3 at The Sugar Bowl.

I give Props to the concept, so add a star. 
I think it's over-hyped, so delete a star. 

In the end, this place cancels itself out. (Hence the 3 stars for \"netural.\") I'll explain.

The concept of an hometown ice cream parlor is applaud-able. The execution is great - everything is branded and consistent. The menu brags of wide variety, although if you don't know how to read the toppings, mixing and concoctions section, you may find yourself with a headache that's not from the sugar. So, it's best to go with somebody who's been before. I've only been twice. Each time I needed help reading the menu. Maybe that's my problem, though. See for yourself. 

So, once you select a fine sugary treat, you're ready to enjoy it. Yet, be forewarned. Don't order anything that's not in a bowl, for you'll get jipped on the portions. If you order a malt, it comes in a cool retro glass, but you'll be finished before you had a chance to unwrap your straw. Just like if you order the cheesecake, which is served on a plate. It's a tiny slice of cheesecake goodness, so don't get your hopes up. (Who really needs all that sugar anyway?)

TIP O FTHE DAY: Order whatever comes in a bowl.  (Hence the name, The Sugar Bowl.)

The portions are more than generous. I had one of the local favorites - apparently the one all baseball players and fans enjoy. It was just okay. I don't remember what it was called, but it's the vanilla ice cream served with a puff pastry. I asked for fresh strawberries on top. Yum. I was expecting the pastry to be warm, allowing the ice cream to melt and me to slip into Sugar Bliss. Instead, I needed a steak knife to slice off my bites. The pastry was frozen, like the ice cream. I was left wanting. (Not to mention I was the last one to finish, due to having to carve off each bite.)

This is a great spot to bring visitors, especially if they're younger than 10. You can't go wrong with patrons not old enough to tell the difference between a Sugar High and a Sugar Let Down."}
{"text":"Classic ice cream parlor! Always very busy, so the service isn't the best. The sundae is excellent!! Kids will love this place as there is a small arcade."}
{"text":"This place gets tons of visitors (customers) from all over the world you would think they'd spend money renovating/updating or at least keeping the location, especially the RESTROOMS clean for their patrons (New visitors & returning clientele). The arcade room smells horrible, the carpet is disgusting. The whole place is in need of major sanitizing and dusting. Yes, its an old fashion ice cream parlor, good ice cream and presentation but definitely not worth the drive.  Sugar Bowl, you have some serious maintenance and cleaning up to do!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place brings back sweet childhood memories for me. Bil Keane was a fan and his Family Circus cartoons adorn the walls. I love the pink decor & my kids love the attached arcade (a new addition since I was a youngster.) I particularly love the Blarney Dream Sundae, subbing out mint chocolate chip for butter pecan. So delicious! Go here for ice cream, not for food."}
{"text":"History!!! Cute old comic strips that have Sugar Bowl mentions!!!

Delicious ice cream sundaes and milkshakes!!! Sorbet!!!

Pink decor!!! Cute old diner-y look!

So much to love at the Sugar Bowl, but when we came at around 9pm on a Saturday night, they were hopping and service left something to be desired. Wouldn't knock it down below a 4 though - this place has much to offer and is a 60 year old staple in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"I love the charming interior! The menu cover has some comic strips by Bil Keane. I got the Buster Brownie sundae and my husband got the Dark Chocolate Malt. We were both in sugary heaven the whole time we were in Sugar Bowl. We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"A throw back in time.  I loved the pink parlor look.  It needs to be updated as long as they keep the decor.  Got the buster brownie and it was excellent.  Everyone loved their dessert and I never noticed the server which is a good sign of good service!!! Can't wAit to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Very touristy ice cream joint. Found out they are serving a chain brand of ice cream. 
Nothing really special except that it's a good place to hang after having dinner."}
{"text":"Really cool and historical place. We had 5 different ice cream treats and everyone was happy. They only get 4 stars because the floor was a mess and the bathrooms were gross. It's an old old place and really really busy all the time. Just don't look down or use the facilities!"}
{"text":"It's a ice cream place with a diner vibe. Good sized ice cream and price! Everything inside is pink. The coffee ice cream was particularly yummy!"}
{"text":"If you think of an old fashioned ice cream parlor from the pre-Great Depression, Sugar Bowl would be the best place that replicates the image.  It is not quite like the scene where you have people in roller skates and drive thrus, but Sugar Bowl's interior has all pink everywhere.  You can have the option of sitting at a table or getting served on the bar to go.  I have tried the ice cream and milkshakes, and both are excellent.  I think I need to try a sundae someday because I do not see much speciality in eating a scoop of ice cream from the Sugar Bowl versus the grocery store."}
{"text":"Cute old fashioned ice cream parlor. seemed to have a lot of regulars. we were just there to get a banana split which was very good

enjoyed the family circus cartoons"}
{"text":"Great ice cream and delicious food too is always great service I didn't no problem with their service there!!!! People always very positive and friendly that I always go back"}
{"text":"The Sugar Bowl is the cutest little ice cream parlor I've ever been to! Located in a popular area of Scottsdale, the history and vintage decor of this place can not be beat. I ordered the Desireme Banana Split and my boyfriend got a hot fudge sundae. Both were excellent! Everything the servers walked by with looked amazing!
The prices were very reasonable and the historic charm was off the charts! I loved how the menu shared some of the establishments history and featured \"Family Circus.\"
You definitely want to visit this ice cream gem if you're looking for a good sundae!"}
{"text":"What a cute place!! It's like a blast from the past. It seems to be popular and the service was great. I love that you have to wait to be seated and the little window you pay at is adorable. It seems like a perfect place to go on an ice cream date!"}
{"text":"I am so excited this place opened and so close to my house. I met some friends here. Between us we had the Pho Ga, Pho Chay, and Gyoza. Everything was tasty. I had the gyoza steamed and the dipping sauce was delicious. The bakery items looked great and I was happy to see Japanese cheesecake, which I bought and devoured. It's less sweet and dense than traditional cheesecake and really great. I'll definitely be back for many more meals!"}
{"text":"My sister recommended this place. She didn't tell me it was a pink diner!!! Absolutely love it. The place is clean with great service. Just ordered floats but that was plenty!!!!"}
{"text":"Cute spot in terms of the decor. Service was ok but a bit slow. Quality of ice cream was also just ok. I was surprised to see they have a menu with burgers, sandwiches and even soup. 

More of a spot if you're craving an ice cream sundae, malt, or float - but not the place to find delicious high quality ice cream, if you're a foodie like me. I can see how kids would love this place though."}
{"text":"The place has history but the ice cream and the service is nothing special. I give it three for the history. Their ice cream is very below average compared to Churn, Melt, and other local places but I will say they have the best Patty Melts around. Yummy! The place is kind of run down and dirty these days as other Yelpers have mentioned."}
{"text":"Had a Egg Nog shake. Delicious. Very satisfying for the sweet tooth. If your doing the Old Town Scottsdale walk, be sure to stop by here."}
{"text":"Iconic place has lost its color !! Went with our daughter ... The place was dirty, the machines didnt work and the manager Ben showed no interest in fixing anything... No smiles from Ben we had to wait 15 min to turn in tokens ....what a shame !!! The ice cream was ok ... But certainly not great !!!"}
{"text":"Classic Old Style Ice Cream Parlor that has been around since I can remember. 

This is a must to take your family or out if town guest and just sit and enjoy some great ice cream treats.

Not to many of these ice cream parlors left in Phoenix Scottsdale area any more.

They have great ice cream, shakes, floats and sundaes. 

Gotta take your family here and enjoy while you can."}
{"text":"What a cute little place! Baby pink on the outside AND inside! Such a perfect place for little girls birthday party or date night. It has a retro feel because it's mainly an ice cream parlor but there's a server and waitress to your table. You have the option of also ordering it at the counter and taking it to-go. We ordered the banana split and it was great for sharing. The ice cream was creamy and full of flavor. There's an arcade side to the parlor. That was interesting and fun :-)"}
{"text":"Love the ice, love the prices even more. 
Ambience - well get ready to be transported to Save by the bell years."}
{"text":"There's definitely no enigma in the name. They throw a bunch of sugar in a bowl and serve it. I had one of the banana splits, I felt like it was pretty damn bland with no real flavor. 

Only way to describe it is \"sweet.\" Not chocolatey, not creamy, not tasty, just sweet."}
