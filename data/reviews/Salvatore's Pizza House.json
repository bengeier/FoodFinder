{"text":"My childhood favorite has been upgraded! This place is my guilty pleasure. ..now it has a bar!! Well you just have to take my word for it. The food is phenomenal and the gelato ...scrumptious!

  Stop by and taste it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and a really well run establishment! Yum!"}
{"text":"Best mozzarella sticks in Pittsburgh!!! Well worth the trip. I can't speak much to the rest of the menu. The wings are good, not great but definitely good. However, the pizza is less than desirable."}
{"text":"The best Sicilian Pizza in Pittsburgh !! Staff is always nice and food is always fresh and GOOD!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza here recently and it was outstanding! The price was competitive as well.  I ordered a pepperoni pizza with extra cheese pie for take out and it was ready when promised. I picked it up and received paper plates and napkins. The service was outstanding. The place had a nice crowd now that it has a bar inside. Also, reheating and eating the next day was even better! The sauce was outstanding. The crust was crunchy around the edges with just the right texture and depth. They really have some of the best pizza in the burgh!!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever and I will never go back to support this establishment.

I ordered a small pizza calzone today online with pepperoni and extra cheese.  I go into pick it up on my lunch break and they are busy.  It took me 15 minutes to even get my order.  I take it back to my office to enjoy the last couple minutes of my lunch, only to find that they gave me the wrong food. They gave me a steak calzone.

Mistakes happen and I understand that.  I call them and ask for a refund.  They tell me I need to drive it back there and they can give me a refund.

So again, I have to drive back there and I have no time to get it fixed since my lunch break is already gone.  

When I asked to speak to the owner about the customer service and not being willing to fix their mistake by giving me a discount next time since I was inconvenienced today, he refused to come out and even speak with me.

Mistakes happen and I can handle mistake, but rude customer service I can not.  If you don't respect the people who are paying you to stay open, I will just take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Salvatore's Pizza House is by far the best pizza in Wilkinsburg.  I can't say they have the friendliest staff but the pizza is great."}
{"text":"Pizza is great if you catch them on a good day. It's hit or miss with this place. The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable. One of my favorite places when the pizza is spot on."}
{"text":"This used to be an old standard when I worked in the area, but I still made it down once in a while after I left that job. Great wings and good pizzas too. They also sell the largest pizza I have ever seen. It's 30 inches! Bring your truck if you want to take it home.

This place is so successful that they have changed their decor numerous times over the years (gets better and better).

I can't really think of any reason why you would want to venture into Wilkinsburg, but if you are, this can be a place to eat."}
{"text":"I had an alright pizza and a medoicre hoagie.

I had a pepperoni pizza. The pizza was good, though a little greasier than I'd like. The crust was very good though, almost deep dish but not. Maybe that explains the additional grease?

We also ordered an Italian Hoagie which was not good. It reminded me more of a Subway hoagie. It could have been cooked longer and the dressing was just a packet on the side. The hoagie did come with homemade chips though which were very good.

Maybe it was an off order and I need to return?"}
{"text":"It has taken me a very long time to come back here. After my last experience with this establishment I had to take some time away.

I guess that time away did me some good. My most recent experience here has totally switched my opinion of this place. Maybe it had something to do with the fact I dined in instead of having delivery this time. Or maybe it was because I tried something other than a salad. Who knows the factor this time, all that matters is that I enjoyed it. 

Sitting inside is a bit odd, not sure if they were attempting to make it a symmetrical place and it just ended up lopsided inside instead, but the flow of the place is just weird. Technically three entrances into here. Two via the main entrance and one in what I assume is the game room. What else is weird is that you can call your order in ahead of time and come pick it up. But not just walk right in and pick it up, you have to sit and wait. I'm not sure, but I think they don't actually cook when you call, but when you show up. 

Anyway, those were my observations when I waited for my food to be done. After ordering you have to wait for your food like any other place, but what irked me with this place is you order your drink (mostly bottled drinks) and don't receive it until your food is ready. Really?  I paid for it, give it to me, I'm thirsty now too, not just when I'm hungry.  The 'servers,' and we will use that term loosely here, act as if they have it hard taking your order, folding pizza boxers and talking into a microphone a la an amusement park ride operator. Attitude, no thanks, I didn't order a side if that. Lighten up, you work in a pizza shop.

Enough with that stuff, lets talk food. For as long as you wait, you know it's freshly made. Most subs, what I opted for, are toasted, and mine was perfect. For a half, it was huge, think Subway done right. Something I learned while dining in, you get a pickle in the side. Whereas you don't if you order delivery.  

Two things about the dining area: 
1.  The TV seems like the volume is set so someone with a hearing aid ten blocks away can hear it. 
2.  Leave your trays on the table. I know, odd, especially where you go to the counter for ordering and delivery of food, but just leave the trash on the table (no garbage cans out on the floor)."}
{"text":"There's something about hoagies from pizza places.  What makes 'em so good?  I've hit a lot of local pizza joints including Aiello's, Conicella, Italian Village, Mineo's, Monte   Cellos, etc. They all have uniformly great hoagies.  

So when I stopped here after doing a site visit for work, I ordered the half-sized Italian sub--ham, salami & capicollo with provolone cheese.  This hoagie ranked up there with the best of 'em.  Even though it was only a half, I could barely finish it.  Good thing I didn't order any sides."}
{"text":"Not only does Salvatore's have excellent bar food, but their customer service is extraordinary! 
The workers are always really busy, but they seem to actually enjoy their work, which is highly appreciated! 
I never wait long for my orders and I always leave a happy customer. 
My only grievance is that I can't tip using my card. 
I'm a really forgetful person so planning ahead to bring cash doesn't work out as well as I would like, so tipping on my card is pretty vital, especially when I receive such great service! 
Keep up the great work guys, you'll have loyal customers for life!"}
{"text":"Wonderful hot sandwiches, above average pizza in an area of town with few other standouts.  Try the Chicken Parm sandwich with grilled onions and peppers."}
{"text":"Love the wings. The hot wings are a dry rub. Never was a dry rub guy until I recently. That's what I get every time. Can't really comment on much else. Allow plenty of time before going to pick it up because they are a bit slow, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"When I come in at 9:45 and you close at 10 and your grumpy employee acts like I'm an inconvenience ordering and spending my money there, we are not off to a good start.

Hot as hell outside.  Inside AC is really not cutting it.

Your pizza is only okay, not as good as Pizza Hut pan pizza, imho.

Your subs are all right, had a decent steak and cheese from there once.

You charge extra for every topping.  Ripoff.

I know it's Wilkinsburg and options are limited, but I am not coming back.  That's what cars are for.  To drive you to better food."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my top ten fave pizza shops. They have some of the best pizza in town along with so many other good choices and a cute little bar area in case you want a beer with your meal. It's easy to see why they've been a staple in Wilkinsburg for so many years. It doesn't matter what time of day it is, the place is always busy and hopping with patrons. My recommendation is to try one of everything from their extensive and delicious menu."}
