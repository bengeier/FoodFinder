{"text":"Passed by Giovanna yesterday, and it's all closed up with the windows papered over...don't know if that's a temporary or permanent situation, but just FYI - this restaurant is currently out of commission!"}
{"text":"It is with great sadness and regret that I post my first ever 1-Star review for GIOVANNA TRATTORIA. 

I used to love this place! The experience was like when you have a friendship or relationship that has turned neglectful and dull and you have to breakup. That is how I feel about Giovanna. Here's why:

-Portions are over the top huge.

-The management refuses to offer half-portions (hello! You can make more sales this way and charge whatever you want!)

-The Caesar salad dressing was gross and creamy- like from a bottle...

-The gnocchi was flavourless.

-There was no wine or beer selection last night! They said they were waiting for a delivery- please!

-Way too expensive, especially because the food was shit.

Bye Giovanna. The love is gone. We're through!"}
{"text":"Not sure if the restaurant has had a makeover based on previous reviews or what is happening, but we greatly enjoyed the place on our first visit.  Salad and pizza were great, with very high quality balsamic.  My seafood risotto was first rate and prepared perfectly and my partner's gnocchi with gorgonzola was very good too.   Prices are a bit high but not over the top.  Service was very considerate and very friendly and the tiramisu was out of this world.

I'd like to see a bit longer menu and perhaps a little cheaper for some of the vegetarian pastas, but given the past reviews I'd say either my tastes are very different or something has changed for the better."}
{"text":"I have to agree with first two reviews. I was not impressed with the food at all. Even the something as simple as the antipasto platter (which consisted of salumi, various types of cheeses and giardiniera) was mediocre. 

There are much better places to eat decent Italian food on College."}
