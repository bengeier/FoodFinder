{"text":"I recommend this place a lot to friends.  The food is well made and tasty. The portions could be slightly bigger. Good place for a weekend brunch."}
{"text":"A family friend from Peru was in town visiting, so we decided to take her to El Fogon to see how Toronto's Peruvian cuisine stacked up against authentic Peruvian cuisine. Our visiting friend was amazed by how tasty the dishes were and even walked into the kitchen to compliment the chef. 

We ordered the grilled calamari, ceviche, lomo saltado, and some other seafood fried rice (and of course, we HAD to get some Inca Kola). Everything was great, and the portions are pretty big. I recommend trying the chicha which is a chilled blue corn and pineapple drink infused with cinnamon. 

The only issue I have with this place is that it takes a while for the food to arrive...but I guess that isn't too bad considering how yummy the food is when it gets to the table."}
{"text":"Just kinda meh...hence 3 stars. 

Went as a group of 5 (3 adults, 2 teens) with a reservation on a Friday night. Place wasn't too busy so noise level was pleasant. We ordered the fried plantain (average-pricey for what it was), chicken soup (again, average...only saved by the decent chunks of meat and fresh cilantro), a ceviche-type entree (our guest didn't complain so I guess it was fine), the steak and beans (which my son loved), a grilled chicken entree (again, average), the chicken escabeche (quite tasty but oily) and the steak lomo Saltado (steak strips fried up with onion, tomato and French fries, strangely served with a side of rice...kinda starch-heavy but not bad flavour). Both steak dishes were thin and tough but not terrible. We also ordered 3 beers, a hot chocolate, an inca cola and a 1/2 litre house wine (which is deceiving since they only stock ONE wine..Santa Carolina...not the reserva, either). Total bill $150 plus tip. 

Overall, I'm indifferent which is disappointing given how excited I was. Nothing was awful but nothing blew us away either. Portion sizes were generous (you won't leave hungry) but pricey given the quality of food. Dont bother with the wine-not worth it. Service was efficient during our meal but once we were done, our server was quite chatty and pleasant..no complaints about that. 

Not sure I'd return but maybe. Meh."}
{"text":"I went to El Fogon several times, and I always loved it! My favourite dish is Arroz con Mariscos. Of course, meat dish, like, a bistec is good, too, but I always ordered this. Pisco drinks was unexpectedly good! Can't wait to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I just watched the Restaurant Takeover tonight on Food Network. El Fogon is one of its kind Peruvian restaurant. I went there few years ago with my friends, and we tried their beef heart dish. I think this is one of the signature dish. It was really tasty!! 

After watching the show on Food Network. I actually wanted to go back to try out their new chicken dish, squid dish and the rice soup. Not to mention go back to try their beef heart dish.

I really like the new blue and black decor shown on TV. Hope they are making good business! It is risky to make a complete renovation take over, but new environment is always bring a fresh good looking new start!

I will ask my friend who introduced me about this restaurant, and go back there to dine good Peruvian food and chat our good times again!

I look forward to go back to El Fogon soon!"}
{"text":"The service at this place is fantastic but the food not as good i expected. I love Ceviche but was dissapointed by this one. Maybe cause we didnt order the hot but one, but it lacked a bit of \"zing\". My main course the Lomo Saltado, was similarly just ok, the chicken seemed to lack flavour. On the flipside, the service was pretty good for the most part and its a nice enough restaurant. However, I dont think I will be comnig back."}
{"text":"Saturday night with my date ...and explored this eatery at a bad time....too many people suggested this was a  popular venue for a change of cuisine...but  the sign in the window \" Help Wanted\" ..should have given me warning......
saying S L O W was a kindness ....food was OK....and, they did put new wallpaper up....
Missing :  Native Flute music"}
{"text":"The Avocado salad and pisco sours are the best!  Been coming here for eleven years and the food has remained consistent and delicious!"}
{"text":"We ate in a Friday night , they only have about 20 tables and fewer than half were full so we were seated quickly. Our server had good knowledge of the menu, for three people I spent just over $100 after tip. The food was good but not amazing, and nobody finished their plates, because the servings were pretty huge. I'd prefer they lower the price and lower the portions."}
{"text":"Ambience was nice, family oriented.  Service was bad.  The lady - apparently who was on charge - was first by herself and would come to our table only when we calles her.  Then two more started but they were sent ro do other stuff but assisting the tables.  At the end one of them assisted us and was very very kind. In general service was horrible.  I ordered fried fish.  It has a lot of oil and Inwas expecting a whole fried fish.  Instead I received an oily breaded fish.  It was ok, it wasn't horrible.  We also ordered the grilled chicken that comes with potatoes and rice and it was excellent.  Really really good.  We also ordered mixed ceviche which I liked in taste but the fish out of the whole mix was kind of hard.  We are foodies and one of our fav is ceviche and when we see one we know.  This one was good in taste only not that tender (the fish).  We also ordered the \"escabeche\" chicken which was also good and some house wine which was chilean and was good.  At the end we ordered a dessert similar to \"flan\" and similar to \"creme bruele\".  It came a little broken and the fork was all messed up with the dessert.  I think something happened on its way to the table but they didn't checked it and we had to clean the fork to use it.  The dessert itself was good.  I guess what mostly bothered me was the poor service. In several ocassiona we had to ask for more water and they were not even around to ask them.  My daughter received her dish and her spoon didn't come after ordered until I asked for it again.  They only came to the table when asked.  In general, food was good.  Just a twist in service and the fish of the ceviche tender and explain in the menu that the fried fish is really a fried filete and not a fried fish and they are good to go."}
{"text":"Eating Lomo Saltado is like hearing ocean waves while you picnic on a hill. Little lambs trotting by. That fresh, gripping, sea scent carried through a cool breeze as you shovel spoonful after spoonful of stir fried awesomeness strip steak and hand-cut fries, onions and white rice. If you enjoy eating half as much as me, you should have El Fogon in your life. 

I'm a big man and I like my seafood -- get the mixed seafood ceviche to start. Share their Papa A La Huancaina and the Lomo saltado. Top that all off with a Pisco Sour. Call me, thank me, let's join hands and celebrate joyously as we prance on heaven's clouds with delicious Peruvian in our tummys."}
{"text":"Very friendly host. The main dishes are really expensive: the seafood stew comes with just a few shrimp, mussels, etc., and it's $18. The arroz con mariscos (seafood and rice) must be made with some horrible cheap oil, because I could still taste it after half an hour. The waiter brought one of us the wrong order (even though there was almost no one else in the restaurant, in spite of the many, \"table reserved\" signs), but they didn't a) offer to keep the other order warm while the wrong one was being replaced (which took quite a while); b) offer anything to make up for the mistake (even an Inca Cola would have been appreciated). I can't understand why a business would fail to spend a few cents in ingredients to encourage a customer to come back.

The decor is nice, but looking kind of worn-out and sad. 

Overall, an unmemorable experience for one gringo and one Peruvian."}
{"text":"Love the ceviche (pescado and mixto) here, very authentic! 

They recently underwent a renovation, it looks very lovely in there. The blue and white colour scheme and removal of the side bar really opens up the restaurant and lets more light in."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious Peruvian food.

Came here for an early dinner with a friend a little while ago. 

I got the Peruvian national dish, the Lomo Saltado and my friend got the Arroz Chaufa de Carne with chicken and we split an alfajor.

The Lomo Saltado was really flavourful and the portion was pretty large. The Arroz Chaufa de Carne tasted like a less salty, less greasy version of Chinese fried rice, it wasn't really anything special.

The alfajor however was fantastic! I would definitely revisit this restaurant if only for their alfajor."}
{"text":"My rating is an average of two experiences and one attempted experience here.  The mariscada al fogon was perfect on my first visit, as was the shrimp chupe and the ceviche I sampled.  On visit 2, I went for the Milanese, and the provocatively named cancha--all excellent.  So why the rating?  After checking the web site for hours of business, I arranged to meet friends there last Sunday.  When we got there at noon, it had a grungy little handwritten note saying it was closed.  (It turned out one of my friends phoned and left a message as we had missed the rather bureaucratic 24 hour deadline for e-reservations).  This is no way to treat customers.  (And btw there has not been a \"sorry we didn't get back to you\" call.). Not good."}
{"text":"Food was decent. However the service was extremely poor. Probably the worst I ever experienced. The owner should really consider hiring experienced wait staff. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"El Fogon is one of my few \"haunts\" and it never disappoints. With great staff, nice cozy ambience and decor and an authentic Peruvian menu it's one of my faves.

Appetizer suggestions: Papa à la huaincaina - cold boiled potatoes in a creamy sauce (trust me, it's delicious); fried yuca - like french fries but slightly different and very tasty.

For dinner I usually go with either the tacu tacu con bistek (thinly sliced spiced steak with a delicious rice & bean patty) or the lomo saltado (strips of chicken or beef with onion, tomato and french fries and a side of rice). 

The food isn't overly hot or spicy so it's compatible with a lot of palettes. If you're not big on hot, avoid the little garlic chili dip that comes with the complimentary bread.

Make sure you also try Inca Cola, a Peruvian pop that's like a cross between cream soda and Mountain Dew - ignore the horrific fluorescent green colour, it's actually really tasty."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and was not too impressed. We split a bunch of different dishes but the only dish that really stood out was the sea bass ceviche. It was really really good. I would come back here for that, but not much else. 

The drinks were ok, nothing exceptional though."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch with our 6 month old baby. The brunch specials are priced for great value. We did have to order 3 dishes for me and my wife to eat because we were hungry and the dishes were a tad on the small side. However, the food was delicious and service was prompt. We'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim as I've never tried Peruvian food before.  It helped that this place was mentioned on blogTO's website as one of the better Latin American places to eat in Toronto.  I wasn't disappointed as my meal was fantastic.  I definitely wanted to try some seafood as Peru is known for their seafood dishes so I ordered the arroz con mariscos which was a medley of seafood on herbed rice.  I'm not the best on deciphering ingredients but the beautifully cooked rice was tinted with green herbs (I'm guessing cilantro but I could be wrong) and a generous helping of mussels, shrimp, octopus, rings of squid or calamari, and chunks of super-tender fish.  The seafood was cooked perfectly and everything was seasoned extremely well.  Although the food wasn't what I would call spicy, everything had a ton of flavour.  Service was super-polite and friendly and the atmosphere was nicely spaced yet yet cozy at the same time (there are too many restaurants in Toronto where the seating is so cramped that you feel like you're eating with the people at the table next to you).  I heavily recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not exactly the best Peruvian food in Toronto and the service is ok. It does however have a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been there twice so far and loved it both times. The place is smaller than most places on St. Clair West, with a cozy atmosphere and tasteful decor. There's a nice simple feel to the overall experience, perfect for a nice and relaxing dinner with friends. I tend to go to the restaurant to eat something I can't easily make at home or easily have access to fresh ingredients (ex. fried calamari - so good when made with an industrial deep frier!)

It was an initiation to Peruvian food for my companions so we went with classics. For both visits, we asked advices and recommendations to our waiter/waitress and were quite pleased with the result. The food was delicious both times: the seafood paella was good for two, the seabass ceviche quite satisfying. Treat yourself to a Peruvian Pisco Sour, either before or with your meal. It's zesty and refreshing. 

I will definitely go back, for both special or not-so-special occasions!"}
{"text":"Peruvian food a first for me!

Ordered chicken aguadito which is a really pretty chicken soup.  Was a very tasty soup rich with flavours that I couldn't identify and a nice sweet cob of corn as we'll! YUM!!

Paella and seafood linguine for mains.  Food was really good.  Would definitely make.a return visit!"}
{"text":"This place was great. On the smaller side, but the decor and atmosphere is nice! Can't remember the dish that I got, but it was rice, with a chicken stir fry type dish with fries. It was really good! Also have good vegetarian options. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"My husby and I, went there to have lunch after a long walk. We were starving, so we ordered: anticuchos, salad, Peruvian ceviche and Peruvian paella.
Although we ordered everything at the same time for sharing, was weird that our appetizer, the anticuchos, arrived at the end of our meal. And they were the best part of the meal (ok after the sangria). They come in a good portion of eight slices; they were tender, and juicy. Nevertheless, the place was cheap because they didn't give us enough salsa, and in my experience, the Peruvian restaurants in Mexico City give you at least three different salsas.
I liked the decoration and the service was quick and polite. 
They should be more carefull with the quality of the seafood, because the octopus on the paella was chewy; the ceviche laked condiments, was 90% fish (when supposed to be mixto), and the crunchy fried corn that gives the texture and character was absent as well."}
{"text":"Very authentic spanish/Peruvian food. It seems to be family owned and they definitely treat all their customers like family too. If you love seafood this restaurant is a must. Good prices too."}
{"text":"THE FOOD COULDN'T BE MORE BLAND AND THE SERVICE SLOWER.  Don't be deceived by the pleasant decor - they were on a restaurant makeover show a few years ago.  The food and service do not match the quality of the decor whatsoever.

The meal started off nicely with yummy appetizers.  However, it went completely downhill from there.  The food was super bland and several of the main courses tasted exactly the same!  The service was extremely slow.  The soup came out after the main course was finished.  Some people didn't get their entree til others were finished eating.  And for a party of 6 or more or a party that spends $150+, there's a 18% gratuity which certainly was not deserved in this case.  WE FELT SO RIPPED OFF BY THIS BAD DINING EXPERIENCE."}
{"text":"I was taken to this delightful little hide-away by a friend about a year ago, and then finally went back just recently. What a surprise, the whole decor was completely changed, and I understand they were on \"Restaurant Makeover\". Well they did a fine job, and the food is as authentic as it can get. If you ever feel like a little Latin for dinner, I highly recommend El Fogon. For that quiet ambiance, to great servers, and fabulous food. This is the place to go! 

Salut!"}
{"text":"Interior is nicely decorated and the layout is well planned. Good for intimate dining and for small groups as well. Their service is very good!

As for food, my favourite dish is the lomo saltado but all other dishes I have tried are pretty good. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to try a unique ethnic food restaurant."}
{"text":"I grew up in Peru and I have to say the food is very authentic, highly recommend the Lomo Saltado. My one strong criticism is the service, very slow, not attentive to the table, did not bring all the mains out at the same time, etc. If they approved the service the restaurant would be much better."}
{"text":"When ever i visit my uncle in Toronto, I make sure to stop at El Fogon to order some Lomo Saltado! Lomo Saltado is, from my understanding, the national dish of Peru. It's basically marinated beef served with amazing fried potatoes. It's been a while since I've eaten there, so I can't exactly remember what other ingredients were mixed into the dish; however, I can tell you that this restaurant has left an indelible impression on me, which is why I always make at least one trip every time I'm in Toronto. It's relatively cheap and tasty. If you've never had Peruvian food, I highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"I was there 3 weeks ago. This is my experience.
1.-My friend ordered a Margarita (with Alcohol), when they brought it he told them that it has no alcohol, and if it would be possible to make it a little stronger; so, they took the drink to the kitchen again, a few minutes later the waiter comes out of the kitchen and tell my friend that the Margarita is a little stronger because they put too much alcohol and they will have to charge extra for that (They make a first mistake of no adding alcohol, then they take it to solve the problem and they make another mistake and they want to charge extra for that). My friend asked the waiter, how come you know that the drink it is too strong, does that means that you tasted it; The poor waiter was speechless. My friend told them that they can't decide for the client what is strong or not strong for a drink.

2.-I order a dish with a meat called \"Churrasco\", I think the name in English is \"Skirt\", The waiter bring me a Pork Chop, which it is totally different than the Churrasco (Is a meat that looks like a stake or a rib eye), the difference is extremely obvious. I call the waiter and tell him, that maybe he brought me the wrong plate because this is not Churrasco, he takes the plate to the kitchen to ask the Chef, and from there he comes telling me that the Chef says that is Churrasco. By that time I was sooo Hungry and didn't want to argue with the waiter nor the Chef, so I took the dish.

3.-None of the dishes where above normal, the taste was plain.

4.-The only good experiences was the waiter who was trying very hard to cover all the mistakes from the restaurant. 

For me, I understand that the problems in this restaurant is from the top down, I think it is the entire structure that it is designed to work in that way.

NOT COMING BACK."}
{"text":"I went here last Saturday with my boyfriend for a late dinner date. Coming from Brampton, it was a good 40-minute drive but entirely worth it. The restaurant looks wise isn't much, it's very open and bland. Not much decor and the wicker chairs were a bit weird but still comfy. 

One of the main reasons why I wanted to go here was because they also offer a separate vegetarian/vegan menu - something not many restaurants do so it was a pleasant surprise! The only thing is, you do need to ask to see the separate menu when you're there or they'll likely just leave you with the regular menus.

The food was absolutely delicious. I got the \"Tacu Tacu Vegetarian\" which was a salad, with beans and rice. Seems simple, and it was - but the flavors within that dish were just divine. My boyfriend also loved his food.

It took a little long to get our second round of plantains to come- we ordered it when the server dropped our meals, and we didn't get them until we were near finished (and I'm quite the slow eater) so we ended up packing it to go. 

They could definitely improve on the decor/atmosphere of the restaurant (it's not bad- just seems to be minimal effort) but with such amazing food, and good service it's not that big of a deal. 

I can't wait to come back again and try a new dish! I don't think I've ever been this surprised and pleased by a restaurant's food before."}
{"text":"I'm Peruvian and I miss my home made Peruvian food a lot. I can say that is never going to taste  the same as home including the Peruvian restaurants located in Peru. But El Fogon is the closest; it was really tasty . I ordered Lomo Saltado and my wife ordered Tacu Tacu (both were very well done, especially the first one). U gotta try the new Peruvian fusion food too or Peruvian Japanese makis;  it s amazing ! But i havent seen that in TO though ; if u visit Peru I highly recommend that."}
{"text":"I am Peruvian and I love eating  Peruvian food. I ordered arroz chaufa , one of my favourite dishes for the last 40 years. Unfortunately the dish was disgusting , the meat was not in a good condition. As per the chef, everything was OK. I was so disappointed and leave the all dish full. i just finishing paying the full price of this dish without eating it."}
{"text":"Although, I have not tried everything on their menu. I always applaud small places cooking food to order because it is their passion. In this case, it's Peruvian. 

Like many reviewers have stated, the service here is not the fastest. In fact, one person at our table had to cancel their order because it never came.

That being said, it's still not a reason for me to dismiss going again. Customer service was spot on. Ask them a question and they will do their best to explain each dish. Our party was very large so even if I didn't order what they had I certainly could see what is items on their menu were going to look like.

I ordered the escabeche de pollo. It was tasty. Served with rice and sweet potato (which I swear looked like ginger to begin with). The sauce was zesty, like a tomato vinegar base that needed just a bit more flavour. I loved it!  

Apparently, they make each item to order which may account for the time it takes to get the food. It is worth it.

As for the setting, the blues lend a warm and inviting feel. I cannot imagine what this place looked like before the renovations but I can say, I like what they have done with the place."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Peruvian restaurant! And restaurant in general. 

It is a small place situated on St.Clair. The decor is toned down with a few Peruvian decorations. 

Now, the most important part, the food!
I always like to get the fresh Papaya juice, which is actually Papaya! Not fake frozen fruit with tons of syrup added.  If you are in the mood for some alcohol then you must try the signature Peruvian Pisco Sour. If you would like a soda, Inka Kola is the way to go, and for another Peruvian option Chicha Morada is great to order as a jug for a party of three or more. 

For appetizers there are several delicious options from shish kabob, (very tender and flavourful) to ceviche! Or if your in the mood for something similar to ceviche but with a flare, the Leche de Tigre is absolutely to die for!!! I'm pretty sure the sauce is similar, but with added fried calamari, and cancha, (larger fried corn). This is small, but enough to be shared by two people.  Keep in mind that the main dishes are a pretty filling size. 

For the main course I must recommend the Lomo Saltado. Absolutely Devine! The cilantro really adds to the flavour along with the juiciness that the tomatoes provide to the meat and potatoes.  I always find the portion of this plate to be a big one for me so I always look forward to lunch for the next day;)
Another great dish is the whole fried red snapper, cooked to perfection with a small side of salad, rice and delicious plantain. 

Also, they now have BRUNCH!!! And a vegetarian menu!!! Absolutely fantastic options when dining with friends.  It's a great compromise with all parties enjoying these great dishes and unique flavours from Peru. 

The only reason I did not give a five star is because I feel that if I request Chancha to be made fresh ( it's more delicious when it's warm ) than to have some made in the morning (cold), I should be able to get them made, especially since it's easy to cook and costs $3-$4 for a tiny bowl.  I request for this at every visit. 

Otherwise, this is still an amazing restaurant where you will not be disappointed.  I always dine there for special occasions."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with the intention of trying Peruvian food.  It wasn't anything out of the ordinary in terms of the food as I have tried other Peruvian cuisine restaurants that had a better tasteful experience.  The translation of El Fogon means \"The Camp Fire\" which this restaurant truely lives up to its name as it is dark inside even during daylight hours with dimmed candle lights like an actual camp fire site, only except you don't have a creepy camp counselor eating marshmallows sitting next to you.  

They disappointingly did not have arroz con leche, which is a sweet rice pudding dish served in most Latin countries.  The moment my Peruvian girlfriend heard about this at the time, she was shocked that they did not have it as it is apparently a \"staple\" dessert among Latin cuisine.  I left the restaurant feeling underwhelmed wondering what Tupac Amaru would have thought of this place."}
{"text":"It is rare to find vegetarian or vegan Peruvian food so I was really excited to find that El Fogon had a separate vegetarian menu. Most items on it can be made vegan by request by omitting eggs but the potato salad is made with mayo and the creamy cheese dip (both in the trio appetizer) is obviously not vegan.

The food was really tasty and they had this great hot sauce that I wish I had asked about. Three of us ordered from the vegetarian menu:

- Sierra y selva appetizer trio (potato salad and dip were not vegan)
- Tacu tacu vegetariano (without egg)
- Taco saltado
- Saltado vegetariano

Everything was seasoned well, but my favourite was definitely the yucca fries!

Staff were friendly and helpful. We'll definitely be back!

Note: Entrance and washroom are barrier-free but might be a tight fit for a wheelchair user."}
{"text":"It is hard to find Peruvian restaurants in Toronto, specially ones that actually taste  Peruvian. However, this place does justice to represent Peru. I went here today with my parents for the first time and we weren't disappointed. The appetizers seem to be better than the main dishes. I suggest you try \" leche de trigre\", \"el trio\" and \"anticuchos\". We ordered tons of food and all agreed that because of those 3 plates we will be returning to this place. The service is good and the food didn't take long to arrive as other reviews mentioned. The tip is included (18% or so) so be careful. I almost gave my server tip  but I realized there was already a $30 tip included in my bill.  Overall it was fantastic! I will be back this weekend"}
{"text":"Uy que rico!! Is what I have to say in Spanish to describe how good the food is. I have been here so many times I forget how many, and I will continue coming. Peruvian food is unique in that it's a fusion of authentic Peruvian ingredients with spices, sauces, and preparation from all over the world. El Fogon is quite able to recreate the Peruvian \"sabor\" (taste) in their dishes, and you will not be disappointed. The Lomo Saltado needs to be experienced, but start it out with some Anticuchos! Everything in the menu is delicious. Try some authentic peruvian drinks like the Chicha Morada or spice it up with a Pisco Sour. Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"Good dining experience at El Fogon restaurant. I ordered the Sea Bass Ceviche along with the hot sauce which was quite good. The ambience was beautiful along with some decor from Peru. It was nice to see Inca Cola - a traditional drink. 

Service was okay, when we asked for clarification of what the dishes were and recommendations of what to taste, he responded by reading what was on the description and not really answering the question and walking away. Other than that he did take our orders down correctly and gave us the bill."}
{"text":"Not exactly bursting with options for the herbivore, but there are a few dishes to satisfy you.

I ordered the tacu tacu ($11), a mix of rice and beans fried to a soft crisp; the dish came with a Peruvian Creole salad on the side.  This was my first brush with Peruvian cuisine; satisfactory and quite filling, but bit too carb-heavy for my liking.  

The restaurant seems to be better aimed at the carnivores, as the propotions seemed fair for the price and my friends had to take some of their food home in doggie bags."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a zero star rating. I used to love this place, have been going to el fogon for ages and the food was great, authentic and delicious but today on my birthday I chose to go there because I love the food and I was very disappointed. They changed management and everything changed. The anticuchos I was served were rubber like so hard to chew couldn't finish them, then the ceviche that I aways ordered was delivered to the wrong table and after a few minutes the server realized the mistake came back to the Table beside mine to ask if they had touched it and they say no, so he took it and put it on my table, ok I trusted they hadn't touched it so here I go my mouth is watering because I've been craving the ceviche for so long and oh disappointment, someone decided to add milk to the ceviche? Sorry but the Peruvian authentic ceviche DOES NOT include milk nor any type of dairy, it is fresh fish or see food cooked in lime juice with onions and ajis but NEVER EvER includes milk. Needless to say I sent it back and did not order anything else, I'm sad to say that after maybe 20 or 30 times of going to else fogon and loving its food this was the first time I dislike the dishes and will be the last time I will go there. Now on to find an authentic Peruvian restaurant because this is not longer it."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat in the area and El Fogón had the best reviews out of all the ones we looked at. It's a very cozy, homely restaurant. I'd never had Peruvian food before, so I didn't know what to expect. To me it seemed to resemble Chinese food - my friend got fried rice with chicken and I got fried fish on top of rice. The food was pretty good and our waitress was very friendly. I wouldn't travel all the way to eat here, but if I'm ever in the area looking for a place to eat, I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant. Food was great, fresh and flavourful. My last visit was such a disappointment I'm hesitant to ever go back. We arrived for lunch and there was only one other couple at the restaurant. The only server was on the phone (a personal call we were able to hear all of it while staring at her hoping for service). Then she finally decided to come over. When our food arrived, it tasted stale, it was probably prepared sitting in a Tupperware and it was freshly microwaved for us. 
Bad food+bad service. I used to recommend it, not any more."}
{"text":"I'm currently sitting in the restaurant. Ordered one hour ago.  No food. No eye contact from waitresses. Asked for bread.  They ran out. So half the customers have bread half don't.  I'm the third or fourth table waiting for food... Not understanding the wait.   Walking out after an hour and 15 mins"}
{"text":"I got hooked on Peruvian food a couple of years ago when I was in L.A (the name of the restaurant escapes me).  I have not been able to find a Peruvian restaurant that compares to the one in L.A. but this one is close.  The dish that I always get is (lomo saltado).  It is a beef or chicken dish (I usually get the beef) combined with sautéed onions, potatoes and tomatoes over a bed of rice (I know a lot of carbs).  The potatoes are french fries.  The Peruvian restaurant in L.A. used filet mignon as beef so it's easy to see why it sets itself apart from the rest.  Overall El Fogon is good.  Next time I am going to try something else on the menu.  Don't forget to try the chicha morada it is a refreshing purple drink that is very different from any drink I have tasted again different but good. Get back with me to let me know how you like it!"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment! The servers seemed a bit lost. Some people seemed to be waiting forever but our wait wasn't that bad. It might be because our food seemed like it was leftovers! I had the fried yuca app which was meh. Just a few small pieces and they weren't even cooked that well. I also had the avocado salad which was $8 and so small. A few bland pieces of avocado, potato, and tomato in a very bland sauce. Basically my meal sucked. My friend got one of the steak dishes and she said it was over cooked and tasted stale/reheated. 

I feel like this place could have potential but for bland dishes that are small and expensive it's not going to attract customers. It might've just been us that got unlucky because some of the other patrons plates looked good."}

{"text":"I hadn't come to El Fogon since about 2008, and wow!  They have really trend-ified the decor up (there are still a few llama related brass plates, though!)!  The food has maintained a similar level of tradition to it, which was great!  I had been craving some ceviche for awhile, and the sea bass ceviche really hit the spot!  As did the plantains!  The chicha morada had a nice cinnamon twist to it, and the Alfajores really hit the spot for dessert.  

The only thing was a challenge for the evening was that service was a bit slow, and there was a somewhat loud board meeting going on beside us - but besides that, the atmosphere was friendly and they never tried to boot people out.  I hope to come back again soon to get my Peruvian food fix!"}
{"text":"Peruvian here. The ceviche was dried and tasteless, worst ceviche I tried in my life. I returned a second time, my mistake, ordered jalea. It was not a jalea. The pisco sour was tasty."}
{"text":"What a nice little find :) This is my second time having Peruvian.

Ordered a plantanos fritos (fried plantine) for starter, lomo saltado (fried sirloin with fries and rice) for entree and my friend ordered a mariscos platter (seafood with yuca cassava and rice). The food was tasty but a little on the heavy side. So needless to say, we were too full for dessert....

We also tried this drink called Pisco Sour. It was refreshing super sour =P."}
{"text":"Probably wasnt a good idea to try this place on Easter Sunday.  I think the staff wish they were all off work.  I ordered the Lamo Special Beef and got Cassava fries instead for an extra charge.  I was hoping for a fresh beef with onions dish but the beef was overcooked and pieces were cold.  The fries on the side were old and the Cassava fries were not cut or cooked properly.  It was a dissapointment for the $15 plus price."}
