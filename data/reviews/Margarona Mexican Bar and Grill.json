{"text":"Great  food, large  portions, great service at lunch. I work  nearby and  eat here  2 to  3 times  a month and  it is never crowded. Authentic food. Good prices and  weekly specials."}
{"text":"DONT EAT HERE!!!! The food is awful and the staff does not know the menu. 
The chips are stale, the salsa is grade C and they don't even give you your own bowl to dip out of!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time going! Beans and rice were the most unflavored I've ever had, the chips taste like they are from Food Lion, the salsa is watered down, the pico had NO taste, the sweet tea looked like water, the fajitas both steak and chicken had absolutely no seasoning and the meat was overcooked. On top of that the \"manager/cook\" was super rude when we told her about the quality of the food. Never again!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time tonight, I should have just stuck with what I know. But I wanted to give them a chance. Yeah well I shouldn't have, nasty nasty and nasty. Did I say nasty? The rice was crunchy, that's new. Huge onions and peppers no problem, not cooking them yes that's a problem.  The chicken or lack there of, yeah really bland. Talk about being disappointed. I surly was, it was a fajita quesadilla which are always good usually at any Mexican restaurant, but not here. They topped it with a three cheese combination, I felt like I was eating a inside out Mexican grilled cheese sandwich. I'm so upset and I was super hungry, the best thing was the chips, and that's not something they give with take out. That's shocking, I've never ran into that before. Needless to say I will not be going back. I tried and that's it."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Food tasted fresh.  Portions were large and we had to take about half of what we ordered home.  Salsa tasted fresh as well.  Definitely will come back again."}
