{"text":"We waited ten minutes before someone came over to us. When it came to the service, we had to ask our waitress multiple times for jam/ketchup. She said sorry she kept forgetting. When we received our bills, we noticed it said 18% gratuity. When we went up to pay, the option came up on the hand held to add a tip. I asked to be sure the tip was included and I was told no it's not (multiple times she repeated this). I asked to see the receipt I gave to her and she said she would re print it but there isn't tip included. I should have questioned it more but added a tip, later to see the reprinted receipt that said 18% gratuity and the waitress insisted to still tell me it's not. Conclusion: it is included. There were three people in my party and each had gratuity  of 18 % on each bill. Gratuity should be a choice and to be honest, with the experience we had, we wouldn't have even tipped that much."}
{"text":"Wow. So bad I don't even know where to begin on this one. I really wanted to like this place as I live above in the Art Condos. What a huge disappointment. I totally understand that restaurants have kinks to iron out when they open but this is beyond that. I have worked in restaurants before and I've never seen anything like this- staff have no idea what is going on, food is totally hit miss (my poached eggs came out like boiled eggs), service is horrible to say the least, not one person knows anything about the menu (this goes for every single person there.. Literally not one person knows), no one has any passion whatsoever..
Those aren't even the really disappointing things. The really disappointing things would take me too long to list but one of them being is that the manager doesn't care about feedback. When asked how our meal was, I said it was 'just ok' and he just walked away! Why wouldn't you welcome feedback if you are a new restaurant to make things better? I don't think I have had a more terrible experience in my entire dining experience in this city."}
{"text":"Went to Recess with high expectations after reading blog t.o. as well.
It was the worst experience ever and doesn't deserve even one star.
Food took over an hour and it was cold when we did get. It was very bland. Server was unpleasant and nowhere to be found. Saw other customers waiting long periods and some just leaving. Waste of a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Went today with a friend for lunch and also tried the floats. The only thing they had available was hamburgers. The hamburger was nothing special, the floats (from the fountain) were really bad. On top of that there were some flies. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Went to Fountain, which is attached to Recess. We both ordered the burger which looked pretty good. It was absolutely covered in a sauce that I personally found awful which was not listed on the menu as being a part of the burger. Like, completely swimming in the stuff. I took a bite of the burger and did not like it at all as I could only taste the sauce. It was basically a mayonnaise sandwich. When the server returned much later, she asked if everything was alright and I explained that the sauce was bad. She very quietly apologized and took the plate away, returning a few minutes later with the bill.

In all the service was below mediocre. She was inattentive, unpleasant, and seemed to be in a hurry, despite there only being two tables in the restaurant. In the end we paid our bill and left unsatisfied.

Will not be back."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. We were told up front the food would be a 20-30 minute wait, which ended up being over an hour. When the food did arrive, it was cold and we didn't have any cutlery. We had to wait another 5 minutes for our server to bring us cutlery so we could eat. It ended up taking around 2 hours in total, for a mediocre and expensive brunch."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place.  Too many disappointments and according to the notice, too many unpaid bills.

{"text":"Had the chicken waffle and it was great. The chicken was hot, cooked and breaded to perfection, and the large homemade Belgian waffle literally melted right in your mouth. The presentation was spectacular as well. Overall delish! My waitress was very pleasant, the restaurant vibe was great."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast in the afternoon, nice spot! Staff friendly food is nice. Can use better presentation though for the food."}
{"text":"People who speak so badly about a place that just opened are SO lame. Give them a chance to improve and work out the kinks before you ruin a reputation for a business. Anyway, yes I went when it first opened and had to wait for a while as well but I was patient and guess what? Worth the wait! The food was super yummy and I can't wait to go back. 

All the other negative Nancy's need to realize what it's like to have a brand new restaurant and the challenges they have to face in order to perfect it. Bayeeeee"}
{"text":"Came here during opening weekend of \"Fountain\". They were having $1 burger and $1 milkshake promotions.  We ordered two of each, plus a classic breakfast plate.  The burgers took forever to come, and when they finally came, one of the patties was under cooked and inedible... The breakfast plate never came... We were so fed up at this point, we cancelled the dish and asked for the bill. There were a lot of staff milling about, back and forth between the kitchen and the front, so Im not sure why the service was so slow. We noticed we weren't the only ones that had to wait a long time, there were a lot of other impatient tables... I understand the restaurant is new and may still be working out its kinks but... a restaurant shouldn't open its doors until it's really ready, otherwise you get unsatisfied customers that would not return. It's really a shame because we live in the area and had high hopes for this place..."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service I've ever experienced. I really wanted to like this place as I live right above it, but boy was this terrible. After waiting over an hour for our food, and having the wait staff completely ignore us, our food arrived cold. We were also unable to eat our cold food as we did not have any cutlery. We had too ask THREE different servers for cutlery, before we finally received some. We literally watched the waitress go around to other tables, fill up water jugs, go into the back, chat with another waitress, before a different server finally got us cutlery so we could eat our cold food. No apologies, no acknowledgement that for some reason it took 10 minutes to bring us cutlery. 

We all left very dissatisfied, the wait staff never apologized or acknowledged how terrible their service was, or even asked. We received no complimentary anything as others seem to have gotten. 

This is the first negative review I have ever written in my life, I was hoping to overlook their \"bumps\" as they are a new restaurant, but this was so absurdly horrible I felt compelled to write something.

Please get your act together recess."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars with room to improve! I love this place as they listen to feedback and make actionable changes. I work across the road and hate pizza so leveto is really not a choice for me. I know hate pizza but hey i just do okay lol. So when Recess and Foutain opened I was super excited! The service and food have steadily got better and better as this place starts to find its legs. I have found that they take feedback well. I complained about not getting silverware when dishes arrived, so they added roll-ups with the cutlery in the napkins small but simple smart changes! :) Or when vegetarians asked for soymilk and almond milk to be added to the menu they listened 

Finally, my fav thing is how much they respect loyalty. When I was not interested in the fried fish in the fish and chips they custom made a pan seared fish dish for me! I love these guys will keep coming back and ps. try the luxardo cherry milkshake you will not regret it. 

Yeah this place is expensive, yeah the staff are learning the flow of the place. But hey give them a few months support them through the bs of finding good servers in Toronto which is harder than you might think. But they will get the costs down or the food quality up even higher than it is now And you will find the service even now is getting even better I had a biz lunch there and was in and out in 30 mins. that's totally okay."}
{"text":"We wait 2O minutes for our drinks today for brunch. Then 2 hours for our food. We even were told twice that we were next in line. We watched 14 other people walk out out of frustration. 

Our server started to \"hide\" because he couldn't give any updates so that also added to the frustration. 

I even asked them to make some adjustments if they needed to and that was met with a \"it's coming\" sort of response. 

I couldn't believe how bad it was, truly. I wanted it to be good."}
{"text":"Interiors were super cute, but strangely there was low traffic of diners in the restaurant.
Both Fountain and Recess menu were available on one dining area, so I thought it was a win-situation.
For our 10pm craving, I had a benny with a cherry milkshake. Bf had an apple pancakes and a chocolate milkshake.
It was delicious!- the only thing was that it took veryyyyyyyyy long for the orders to reach our table.
Thankfully there was a large projector screening the Olympics."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. We waited 45 mins for a drink and a total of 1 hour and 20 minutes for our food. We ordered a breakfast with eggs, hash brown, fruit and a baguette. The eggs were over done and the rest was mediocre at best. Our server had said he would take something off our bill since we waited so long. However, when it came time to pay, the cashier did not acknowledge when we asked about it. She printed our bills and we asked about the discount again. She said he wasn't authorized to do that and did not bother to speak to him or get the manager for us. We left completely unsatisfied and will definitely not be returning.

I get that this is a new business and they have a lot of things to work out but this was absolutely ridiculous. There is potential if they start getting it together but I will not be surprised if it closes down."}
{"text":"They are ridiculously understaffed. Weren't even asked what we wanted to drink for 30 minutes, and people around were visibly irritated. I don't blame the waitresses who were probably doing their best, but it was incredibly hot with no air and sun burning through the windows. Very uncomfortable, not worth a visit."}
{"text":"Blog.to was pumping this place so me and a friend tried it. 

They are doing a soft opening. But this opening seems unusually soft. 

Had to stand for 7 minutes until seated. Three staff walked by and said sorry.

Waiting over a 1/2 hour to get my burger. 

They had one overworked server for the whole floor. 

No diet coke or diet drinks. 

Straw for my friends drink was shorter than the glass. He had to ask for a replacement straw. 

As I write this I have ketchup delivered but nothing else. 31 mins. 

Oh food is here now. 33 mins. 

My friends blueberry pancakes look good but taste quite oily (my opinion). He also says he maple butter tastes like whipped oil. Hmm.

My burger looks pretty odd. A chunk of meat broke off when i lifted it up and fell on my pants. 

Burger kind of bland. Bottom bun is compressing from too much liquid. It's one of those wonder bread textures.

My friend says the pancakes get a bit better as he goes through them. He says the top one was not his favourite. He gives them a 7/10 now. 

I's give my burger a 3/10. For $18 it really fails. A big mac is much tastier (lol).

Oh I just found out that The cheesy topping they put on the burger only covered HALF of the patty. I just ate the half with toppings but rest is plain burger with no toppings. Burger rating 2/10 now. $18 sheesh. I brought this up and they took my burger away and returned oddly with a new 1/2 burger. This one with maybe twice the toppings of the last whole burger. 


My friend likes the bacon on his pancakes but says he needs more syrup. He got a huge stack of pancakes but only one of those small metal condiment cups of syrup. Compare that with golden griddle or iHop! He asked for more but he really shouldn't have had to since they gave too little.

Suggestions:
- provide more maple syrup for pancakes (how about a bottle?)
- cover whole burger patty with toppings 
- provide paper napkins to better absorb oil and syrup. The cloth napkins don't actually work as well.
- Get rid of hat burger or find a way to fix it. For sure improve the bun. More seasoning on patty too so you can enjoy the taste of the meat. 

This review should be interpreted within The context of a restaurant in the first two weeks of a soft launch."}
{"text":"I'm so meh about writing this review, but procrastinating from accomplishing work at hand has led me to share my experience. My friend and I stopped in here for a 'quick' bite to eat before getting ready for a prior engagement. Let's emphasize the word quick and note that this experience was unbelievably far from that.

Service was OK. My friend ordered the Eggs Your Way, which was alright. I ordered the Nutella French Toast and to balance it out, the Grapefruit Pancake stack. The food took an HOUR to arrive at our table. A whole hour for eggs, toast and sliced grapefruits. Now I'm laughing at how abysmal these dishes were. 

Ok so, the waitress explained the Grapefruit Pancake stack was \"grilled\". They were warm at best, but whatever, waste of 8 bucks.

The Nutella French Toast - I was seriously looking forward to carbo-loading on this, but my diet was saved because they didn't even bother to cook the Toast all the way through and it was dry and stale all through the center which made the experience less enjoyable. I think the waiters noticed the distain on my face which prevented them from approaching my table (fair, my resting bitch face can be intimidating.) I was expecting hella Nutella all throughout the toast, which would've made up for the lack of cook on my Toast. No. It was like a spoon. Like a spoon you secretly take when no one's looking. Sigh.

I'm only giving this 2 stars because the waitress was nice enough to knock the French Toast off my bill."}
{"text":"Terrible dining experience waited for over an hour for a burger and a salad, food was barely edible would not recommend or return to this place."}
{"text":"Recess Diner opened at 5pm today and we stopped in at 6pm for supper to check them out.  We live in the 'hood and have been waiting for them to open.

After we ordered drinks, we were told that they only had two of the eight entrées available ... the $17 burger and the $39 steak.  Huh?!  We decided to eat elsewhere.  I asked for our bill ... and then had to ask for it a second time.

There was lots of staff buzzing around.  Though they were all friendly and professional, they seemed confused and didn't know what was going on.  We asked our server about the entrées and she had to keep going back to ask the chef about them (before she realized that there were only two available).

I get that they are just opening and haven't ironed out the bugs.  But if I was the owner of a restaurant, I wouldn't open until I knew that everything was in working order.  I wasn't left with a very good impression."}
{"text":"The servers are very nice and hard-working but this was a new place and it took forever to get our food. There were many, MANY mistakes with our orders. We waited over an hour for our food. With that said, this place has potential to be a lot better."}
{"text":"$12 brunch was extremely tasty, and I love the ambience and location. Docked one star for slow-ish service and missing items, but I am willing to overlook it as they opened recently and are still figuring things out."}
