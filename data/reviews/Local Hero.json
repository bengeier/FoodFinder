{"text":"Local Hero is a subterranean mashup of caf√©, ice cream shoppe, &...dvd rentals??!!  Yes, it's true!  I didn't order any caffeinated beverage from here, but I did take advantage of their unique ice cream flavours and they were yummy!  Not sure if they make it themselves, but I did not see any branding.  A larger cone ($3.99) accommodates 3 flavours, so I got an strawberry, espresso, & chocolate peanut butter.  All good, but probably the chocolate peanut butter was my fav!  There is also some seating towards the back that looked chill.  And if you want, feel free to browse through the shared space of Film Buff."}
