{"text":"This place is the best hot table in Vaughan !  The lunches real good. They change the menu daily and every is fresh. The 3 brothers that run the place are great guys and go out of their way to please."}
{"text":"Really disappointed I ordered a  Peamael bacon sandwich and was surprised to see only one piece of bacon on my sandwich I ended up going to buy a 5.00 pack of back bacon from the grocery store and make more..."}
{"text":"Was here for breakfast and they didn't disappoint. I had the \"Big Omelette\" and boy, it's big . The taters are thinly cut and fried, they are delicious. The omelette is stuffed with cheese, onions and Italian sausage. The taste is fantastic. And you better be hungry to eat the whole thing. Service is very friendly. We will be trying the hot table soon, can only recommend this place. On top of that the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"A hidden treasure.  Traditional and tasty Italian dishes with daily specials.  Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Came here first time and definitely will come back! Very clean place with kind personnel. The breakfast  was so delicious! Had western omelet, eggs and bacon, 2 cappuccino. Total was $21.90. Portions are huge."}
{"text":"I had the egg white omelette and my husband had the Spanish omelette. His was huge and mine was so tiny. No home fries came with mine which was disappointing. My husband said  his omelette was amazing and the best home fries he has ever had.  Next time I will try something different."}
{"text":"I've been to Pippo's Trattoria several times and the food quality and service has been consistently great.  Their potatoes at breakfast time are unique, and I think are the best in the GTA.  A fresh and clean breakfast made to order and served hot.  

Coming to Pippo's in the morning is having delicious breakfast with friends and family.  The staff pay careful attention to their customers and the customers even say good morning/bonjourno and on a Friday wish their fellow patrons a good weekend.

I'll be back to try their hot lunch menu and a mid day coffee."}
{"text":"I'd be here everyday if I lived in the neighborhood. Amazing espresso. Awesome lunch , had the Italian sausage plate. Fast and super likeable staff."}
{"text":"Walking inside Pippo Trattoria made me felt like I am at home. A home full of nice caring families and friends which all making sure I have a good time.

Hot tables with a rotating choices of protein including rabbit, osso bucco, lamb shank, roasted beef, chicken and more. Or if you want something lighter, there is also sandwiches and pizza and even pasta to choose from.

For me, I just feel like having a cappuccino ($2.75) any time of the day! 

I would definitely be back here for breakfast, lunch or even afternoon \"coffee\".  And maybe a glass of wine with my lunch?"}
{"text":"Staff is always so great and wonderful. Always super welcoming, which is great. 

I would say though, make sure you arrive before the lunch rush, as they get cleaned out pretty quickly of their lunch specials. 

Another thing...they're lunch portions are quite small, and price can sometimes be pretty expensive. 

However, food is always cooked fresh in the morning (you can tell) and they've got a good selection of sides to choose from. 

Picture is cannelloni, potatoes (really small portion)  and rapini."}
