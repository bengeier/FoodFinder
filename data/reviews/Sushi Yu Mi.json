{"text":"For starters, I've never actually eaten IN the restaurant- have only ever taken out so I can't really comment on the atmosphere... however, the sushi that I have brought home or to work has been stellar. Super fresh, you know it's made with care and precision (as it took some tiime while they prepare awesome rolls for you- for 2 people $45 it took around 20 minutes and I was the only customer in there).. That said, when I got home my husband and I were pleasantly surprised at how fresh, original and tasty the maki and sushi were. A definite must when you don't know what to eat for dinner & don't feel like cooking!!"}
{"text":"Very good place to catch a quick bite! Quality sushi. Ordered a vegetarian tempura roll of the menu and it was amazing! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Super impressed. The portions were huge, they didn't rip you off on the amount of seafood in the soups, salads and mains. The prices were great! The service was just fine. Perfect example of a Japanese restaurant with their own twist which WORKS! I am already dreaming about my next visit."}
{"text":"Petit bonheur trouvé sur yelp. J'étais passé devant plusieurs fois sans m'arrêter, mais ça rn vaut tellement la peine! Les prix sont très abordables et la qualité est incroyable!  J'y retournerai encore plus en apétit!"}
{"text":"A while ago I switched to the cheaper/faster competitor across the street for convenience. I went back today for takeout- still more expensive and slower but what a difference in quality!! I had the tasting plate and everything was absolutely delicious. I barely touched the soy sauce there was so much flavor already. Tom yum soup had actual crab and salmon piece in it, and the fish was fresh and tender! I'm a fan :)"}
{"text":"Just got a take away from them on a whim - and didn't regret!  I did examine the menu in advance, but decided to listen to suggestions they had.  The waitress was very helpful, tasting menu didn't catch my eye on the menu but was nicely explained over there - and it was really great. Just enough of a portion, tasty, nice presentation - and in my neighbourhood! It is a small place, so don't expect too much privacy, otherwise it is very pleasant minimalistic design and you could see what's up with cooking   i am definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I order from this place weekly. The Yu Mi Tasting menu is the perfect size and variety of rolls. Really creative rolls, fresh fish, and soft rice. What more could you ask for? It's a bit depressing to eat in the restaurant. Decor is weak and awkwardly quiet. Do takeout or delivery if you can. Maybe it just tastes better in front of the TV."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch last week and was neither super impressed neither disappointed by the food.  Good freshly made sushi (but not outstanding), good service, and generously portions (less rice, more YUmMIness - see what I did there?). Bill came up to $35 for 2 which is not bad for lunch.   Will I be back? Probably not. But only because Montreal is jam packed with tons of excellent sushi places so the competition is quite high :)  Nonetheless, a great option for a quick lunch in the area."}
{"text":"Nous avons commandé des Sushi pour le bureau, il y en avait pour 200$ de commande. Tous les employés ont adoré, c'était des sushi de très bonne qualité. Le service à été impécable surtout considérant que notre commande à été passée seulement 1h d'avance. Chapeau à l'équipe de Sushi Yu Mi!"}
{"text":"We made the order for take out and when we arrived at   the restaurant it was ready on time.  It's a cute cozy place to sit and eat as well.The sushi  was tasty and fresh . A mix of good choices .Will definitely eat there again.Service was good and so is the location ."}
{"text":"Great sushi!  The lunch combos include a vegetarian option with interesting and tasty rolls (not simply avocado or cucumber rolls!).   Most of the other rolls were also surprisingly  interesting, even the traditional California roll, which was made of real crab.  Service was fast and our waiter was very courteous."}
{"text":"For a small shop I was expecting the same low quality food as Sushi Shop but I was surprised by the quality and creativity of each dish!  Each appetizer that came out was great in taste, quality, and presentation. Still really shocked for a small restaurant that does mostly take-outs.   Would recommend the sashimi platter app and the lobster, crab, shrimp salad app. It was fantastic!   It did help that the hot sake was only 18$ for a whole bottle :)"}
{"text":"Have walked past this place dozens of times and finally decided to pop in for lunch.  It's a small casual sushi place.  Despite its basement location, it's a bright space and doesn't feel cramped at all.  They have lots of reasonably priced lunch specials.  The miso soup was quite good and generous with the mushrooms.  Also had avocado rolls and spicy tuna rolls.  The fish was nice and fresh but I would have liked a little more fish and less tempura flakes in the roll.  Service was good.  Overall decent sushi for the price.  Will try their takeout menu soon."}
{"text":"Great tataki salad. great use of fruit and interesting textures in rolls. Amazing quality fish"}
{"text":"The Maki Lovers Classic is a great preview of their menu. Absolutely delicious. 3 times in the past month. Will be returning again and again, best sushi in the Westmount/NDG area !"}
{"text":"I was really happy to see there was a new sushi restaurant in my neighbourhood and even happier to find out that the food is good and the prices are reasonable. Yes!   Friendly service, a good variety of specialty and classic rolls, nice presentation, and I have to say - they did a nice job of the branding, too.   My bf and I tried the green salad, two of the numaki rolls (which are wrapped in rice paper), two types of sashimi and two of the classic rolls. We didn't love the numaki rolls (lobster and grilled chicken), so we'll skip those next time. But the green salad was a nice serving size and I really liked the light vinaigrette. My bf enjoyed the sashimi, and the two classic rolls I ordered (spicy salmon and shrimp tempura) were delicious!   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best I've had in MOntreal since moving here 10 months ago from Vancouver. Casual and super chill atmosphere. Maybe not a romantic date place but definitely a nice place to sit and eat a meal. Service was 10/10 including servers recommendations. Miso soup is special with tons of mushrooms. Warm shrimp mango roll and spicy tuna were awesome. Only complaint, I don't live closer. Worth the drive from plateau."}
{"text":"Ok sushi. Had the tasting menu. While deciding what to pick the owner showed me something looking great. I ordered it and it came missing things he said would be there. Bothered me. Food was average. Miso was watery."}
{"text":"It was my first time having sushi in Montreal and I must say, it was well worth the wait. Small quaint restaurant, excellent food with awesome prices. I did not expect the portion sizes considering the prices, and the store size.   Also an located English-speaking neighbourhood so plenty of others to speak to. Waitresses friendly, chefs are pleasant.   Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Price was definitely right for food that could easily pass for more expensive if it had the right ambiance. Had the yumi salad which was excellent and their sushi pizza and all their so called favorite items and all delivered excellence"}
{"text":"We had some take out. The staff was great and efficient. The sushi are really good and the price is fair. Worth the try !!"}
{"text":"Great little place. The food exceeded my expectations. The rolls were good and fresh. They also accommodated gluten-free request.  The gluten-free mango cheesecake blew my mind."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places. It's super close to my work so I tried it out and absolutely loved it. Small menu but makes things easy when trying to choose. The sushi chefs really out a lot of effort in each dish. I've also ordered the larger group combos to go and loved all of it. The price is a little higher than I would like for a place I'd visit regularly so I save it for special occasions."}
{"text":"I'm very particular when it comes to sushi restaurants, food wise, this place is a 3 star. But I truly really enjoyed dinner at this place, the atmosphere and decor, the ever smiling waitress, and the price point is unarguably attractive. So I'm giving it a 4.  The small boutique-like restaurant is stunning. The simple colors and decors only highlighted the clean and elegance of the place. I was in love with it the first moment I stepped in there and secretly promised myself to decorate my future kitchen in a similar light. The waitress is all smiles and extremely nice! She greeted us and since we had a buytopia deal for Chef's choice, she explained what it included and more, gave us ample time to decide.   For $20, we got a sizable tataki salad, lobster, shrimp and crab meat in a filo cup, 4 specialty maki rolls (4 pieces each), 1 avocado maki roll, 2 tea pots with individual choice of flavored tea, and a piece of cake. The tataki salad is a great appetite starter, the yu mi sauce was great, with enoki, seaweed, mango slices that complements the plentiful of seared hamachi, tuna and salmon as well as the regular salad elements. The lobster and crab salad is creamy and delicious, they are very generous on giving plenty of seafood meat and the filo is eatable and quite good with the seafood it holds. The maki that came with chef's choice includes the salmon extrava, soft shell crab maki, shrimp tuna and mango maki and the salmon asparagus maki. The maki are not bad, but nothing impressive, the fish meat is generally made in the crushed form and it's a little hard to distinguish each roll from the other, the taste is not distinct enough from each other to be noticeable. For the after-dinner tea, there are quite a few flavors to choose from, most are the basic tea accompanied by some exotic flavors of herbs, fruits or flowers. They are served in individual teapots. We also got a choice of cheesecake and keylime pie, we chose the chocolate cheesecake. I couldn't eat too much since I'm lactose intolerant but for the few bites I did get, it tasted pretty good.  Overall, I think the dinner was very enjoyable and had a lovely experience here."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! Les prix sont très raisonnable et la qualité est excellente.   Il faut essayer la soupe miso au fruits de mer!  Le decor est tres simple et le restaursnt ce trouve dans un sous-sol, mais ne vous laissez pas décourager par cela, c'est de loin le meilleur sushi du coin pour dinner."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of every single thing I had, given the low prices and the small place. The nigiri salad, the shashimi plate, tar tar tuna were outstanding!!! This little place puts to shame some of those pricey high end sushi restaurants Montreal is flooded with."}
{"text":"Unpretentious little gem. It's not a fancy restaurant, but the quality of their food easily compares to some of the best sushi in town.   I was surprised to love this place so much. Sushi is delicious. There is not too much rice in the maki, which is great. Specialties are original and also delicious.  Service is excellent. Waitress was friendly and efficient.   As I am writing this, I can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"Tsé quand une rage de sushi de prend mais que tu ne veux pas ni la version \"fast-food\" de Sushi Shop, ni la version chi-chi d'un grand resto? C'est l'humeur dans laquelle j'étais quand j'ai découvert Sushi Yu Mi et ça n'aurait pas pu mieux tomber.  Petite note à prendre. Le resto est dans un sous-sol, donc si vous êtes en train de conduire et de chercher l'endroit en même temps, c'est une mauvaise idée. Fiez-vous à Google map, trouvez un stationnement tout près puis vous verrez bien le resto une fois à pied.  J'y suis allée pour le lunch et j'ai décidée d'essayer un de leur spécial qui me permis d'avoir une belle soupe miso en entrée et un mélange de sushis variées pour moins de $10. Ça n'est pas le meilleur sushi que j'ai mangé de ma vie, ou même à Montréal, mais ça bat définitivement Sushi Shop sans être plus dispendieux. En plus le décor est simple et joli, et le service est rapide.  C'est un endroit où je retournerais pour l'heure du lunch car leur spéciaux en valent vraiment la peine."}
{"text":"Good enough, nice combos, good service, the price is ok, the tea cup is a glass and the chopsticks are disponsable. Located in the basement they also have mini terrassse in the front."}
