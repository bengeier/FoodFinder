{"text":"This place was expensive we drank 4 shots and one beer for $90.00. Service was horrible, would not recommend."}
{"text":"Super awesome food, friendly people, I love it. Had the fresh coconut with fresh shrimp. You can taste the freshness in the ingredients :) we will be back"}
{"text":"In spite of the terrible reviews, we decided to try this place out. It's absolute trash. First, not all the tacos are on taco Tuesday prices. Or at least we weren't charged taco Tuesday prices for some of the most bland tacos I've tried (Carne asada and pollo). The margarita I ordered was $9 and had not a taste of tequila and the staff, although timely seemed extremely impatient and unhappy. Save yourself the trouble and dissatisfaction and trust the reviews."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a year and every time I go they make us feel special Anabel is always on top of things making us feel like we're home service is great food is delicious definitely one of the best restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Went for lunch here yesterday.  This was the worst Mexican seafood restaurant I've ever been to. 

First off, lousy service: had to get my own silverware, even had to pickup my order from the kitchen because my server was too busy chatting. 

The only thing worse than the service was the food. Absolutely wretched salsa that was so salty that I nearly spewed. The fish taco was mush and the slaw they used must have been from Fry's. The poblano  stuffed with shrimp and wrapped in bacon was way too salty and the bacon was like burnt shoe leather.

Stay away from this nasty place and don't eat here.. Ever."}
{"text":"Overpriced and lack of service. It took over 40 minutes to get our meal and the waitress did not bother to refill the chips or check on us once the meal was served."}
{"text":"Slowest service in the world. Never going back. The food was respectable but it was not even close to the amount of time that we wasted there. 

Do not go here because it is genuinely not worth it."}
{"text":"Ummmm...  Slow,  lousy service.  The staff is used to the \"regulars\"  so they treat everyone else like outsiders.  The food was OK,  not much for the price.  I felt like they were all staring at us,  maybe they were just waiting for the table...  But the place was pretty much empty and I can see why!  No habla engles,  so don't expect a conversation! I won't be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in AZ for mariscos!!!!! The micheladas are so pretty and delicious!!!! My new favorite place for seafood!!! The mariachi there on the Sunday I went almost made me cry. I took their business card and will more than likely use them for my wedding !!! Oysters are SOOOOOO GOOD but try \"la negra\" salsa with oysters!!! If you like lime trust me you will not regret it!!!"}
{"text":"2nd time here today., wife order Fried fish with garlic.. I order fried shrimp, wife loves the fish.. my patter was ok..not to much flavor. but the hot sauce kicked in.."}
{"text":"Sub-par tacos, unreasonably priced bottled beer and a middle-aged bartender dressed like it was a low-budget strip club. Never again. At least the tacos could have been tasty, but no such luck."}
{"text":"They play Mexican music on Wednesday nights and they have karaoke contest first place takes $100, food is pricey for the taste but fun place to do karaoke. PÃ³nganse sus botas y tejanas para venir a este lugar."}
{"text":"Not worth it. Food didn't have any taste. Lousy customer service. And yet, they charged us a percentage for customer service into our bill. Staff was not attentive so why would they charge us for their tips. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Sin sabor, muy caro para lo que ofrecen!!! mariscos insipidos!!! servicio regular!!! no regreso!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it is because they just opened or what! But this place was a waste of my time and money!
We were seated right away and broken chips and excellent salsa were brought out. Everything started out well enough...Drinks and orders taken, drinks brought out in a timely manner...That is where it ended really.  Refills on my soda were slow coming. The guys ordered Beer and we watched the beers hit the bar counter and waited for over 5 mins maybe even a few more before the girl brought them to us. At that point everyone complained they were hot. I thought the food was really good, pricing was okay. One remark was that the shrimp tostada should have avocado on it not an add't 1.50 as a side. The service was really poor. Our orders came out so sporadic we didn't eat as a table. And when asked for the avo, she cleared our table and did other things so that by the time she came back with the avo he was half done with his food making it almost pointless! Had to ask for salsa and chip refills every time. 
We started out as a table of 4. Then 2 other peeps came as we were waiting for our tabs. Because we all knew each other they slid another table up to ours and made us a table of 6.  Boy wasn't that convenient for our server who then felt she had the right to add a 15% tip to our tabs. I was shocked when I saw our tab! appalled that she had the huevos to do that! Honestly she forced us to all to over tip her. I saw no excuse for the lousy service we received so I felt she didn't deserve the tip she gave herself!
As we are STILL waiting to get the tabs, they brought in a band. All I can say is that they were to many members playing the stage! The music would have been pretty good at a different venue. In a small place like this it was nothing but loud and clangy.
I gave two stars for the food and that was it! I do not recommend this place at this time!!"}
{"text":"Great food BIG portions, friendly staff ... The bloody marys can actually be a meal here with seafood a couple beers and veggies along with candy provided in the drink... quite the beverage. I love the pescado entero and the live music is great (You can't hear anything else when its going but, its ok because the artists are awesome)  We go at least once a month as a treat"}
{"text":"Never going back!
My margarita had zero tequila! I'm not exaggerating; zero! It cost me $6.00 when the sign says well drinks during happy hour are $4.00. When I asked about it, they told me \"well\" drinks ARE DRAFT BEER! I said no, it's the crap tequila, vodka, rum, etc. in the WELL!
Not that there was an ounce of tequila in the drink!
We were handed a sheet of specials. We each ordered the burrito combo marked at $5.99. I asked for chicken, hubby asked for pork. We both got chicken. Ok, thanks! Not sending it back in a place where there's an obvious language barrier. 
We're charged $15.98 for both our plates. Again, I ask why? I'm told the prices on the specials ended at 3pm. So why even had us that sheet? She points to the fine print on the bottom that says prices end at 3pm. My bad! I assume since I'm handed the sheet of specials, then there's some specials! 
The food was terribly boring and I bit into an incredibly hard, black thing. I showed it to my husband and we couldn't figure out what the heck it was. At this point, I just want off this ride!
My biggest regret of the day was walking past the Filibertos in the same parking lot to get to this place. I would have at least enjoyed my meal, gotten better service, and paid quite a bit less. 
Please take me back Fili, I won't stray again!"}
{"text":"The service is not bad and the food is pretty good but the music is RIDICULOUSLY LOUD. I also work in a bar with a DJ and karaoke night but it's still not half as loud as this place. It's a huge turn off and the reason why we won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We come here almost every Tuesday for taco Tuesdays and they have the best tacos. The Waitresses are extremely friendly and very accommodating. Would highly recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Great food great service  my husband  had his bday here and it's was awsome ... and awsome happy birthday music.. staff is amazing  only thing I did not like was the cheese on the nachos....amazimg place will go back now we know how great it is"}
{"text":"bland tacos not worth $2.50 each. They had us waiting nearly 15 minutes before they asked us for drinks and gave us chips. we were 3 minutes from just walking out. 

to top it off, they wouldn't honor my 100% valid BOGO-entree coupon. it was an Entertainment coupon which means the restaurant signed up voluntarily to be a part of the program.. which is irritating that they wouldn't accept my coupon without a reason.

our server asked my boyfriend if he'd like another beer, but did not refill my obviously empty water cup.

don't go here - Mexican food isn't hard to come by in Phoenix."}
{"text":"So good and attentive! I've been to a few different sea food places and this is by far the best one, and the atmosphere is great !"}
{"text":"I'm personally giving it a 3 star, but my boyfriend wanted to give it 5 so I settled on a 4.

Atmosphere was nice.  It looked like it used to be some sort of club.  Service was slow.  I hate it when we order and then the couple sitting next to us sits down after we order gets their food first.  Good chips, salsa, and a shrimp broth concoction.  I got the 7 Mares soup.  This is a favorite of mine that I always get at various Mariscos restaurants.  This is my least favorite I've ever had.  Very little quality seafood and they actually put bell peppers in it. Yuck.

Boyfriend had one of their tostadas.  Man that thing was huge!  You can easily split it between two people. It had a lot yummy seafood on it.  My only complaint was that it already had a lot of chili powder on it.  I don't like anything spicy, but the boyfriend loooooved it!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of state and this has been one of the most amazing Mexican seafood places I've ever tried. We went on a Sunday with my family and they had live music it gets super busy so make sure you get there early. Over all I was very satisfied can't wait to go back to AZ and spend a whole Sunday there lol"}
{"text":"Happened to pop in here for lunch during a training...it was DELICIOUS! I got the mixtas fajitas and was very pleased with the portion of meat and vegetables..and the flavors were so yummy! The price was comparable to most restaurants, maybe a little pricey, but totally worth it IMO. Oh, and get the green salsa...mmm! I was the only one in the restaurant so service was great and quick! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Our entire family decided on attending this restaurant for Father's Day as we'd heard that the food was really good and that there was mariachi playing on the weekend. This establishment disappointed in every way possible. Indeed, the mariachi (and banda) played while we were there but it was ridiculously loud. I've eaten at plenty of restaurants where a mariachi plays but you are always able to have your meal and even converse unless the band is right at your table. Here, they were playing so loud that even the waitress couldn't make out your order six inches away from you. We could have gotten past the blaring music if the service or food would have made up for it, but lamentably, they both fell very short of an acceptable level. 

Our waitress had an attitude that made it seem as if we were lucky to even receive service. I am Mexican and grew up in this type of establishment so there is no misunderstanding of cultural norms here. The waitress was plain and simply rude and made a point of not demonstrating competence. Once the food was brought to the table almost an hour later 6 out of 10 plates were incorrect, probably due to not being able to hear the order correctly over the music. We let our waitress know of the mistake but chose to keep the plates so as to not have to wait another hour. Her response was that we should have been louder when we ordered. In the end - the food was lackluster and comparable to what you would be able to get at any drive thru Mexican restaurant here in Phoenix.

In summary, I understand that Father's Day is a busy time but as a restaurant owner you have to be able to anticipate this and train your staff on dealing with large numbers of patrons. Additionally, if your own staff can't hear your customer's orders you could easily turn down your sound system. Just seems like common sense. 

Ambiance - Frustrating
Service - Deplorable
Food - Forgettable"}
{"text":"Best Shrimp Ceviche. They load your order with shrimp for a very reasonable price. Waiters are attentive and give great service. I have ordered Take-Out as well and the food quality was just the same. Very good!"}
