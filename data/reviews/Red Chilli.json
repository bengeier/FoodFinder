{"text":"Very nice place good food.  Everything was nice.  We tried a bunch of meals with friends I had the green curry .  Was on point. One thing I noticed thou is how empty the place was when we got there on Saturday night at 9 pm."}
{"text":"I ordered seafood curry phad thai and was very disappointed. It was completely tasteless. It doesn't even have a curry flavor despite the noodles being bright yellow."}
{"text":"This is our family favourite take out place.  The spicy eggplant is simply my favourite.  All my friends love it.  It is a bit oily, but still worth it.  The delivery service is excellent as we always get our food before the estimated time."}
{"text":"Worst.  Pad. Thai.  Ever. I asked for extra spicy and it was super sweet. The veggies were basically raw. I thought I had been there before and had a good pad that but I must be mistaken.. Won't be going back.. The only good part about the pad thai was that the protein was actually cooked very well. If it wasn't for the cook on the chicken and shrimp I would have given 1 star. What a waste!"}
{"text":"This is such a hidden gem in the East Danforth area. I have been to Thailand many times and this place always reminds me the best part of Thailand... the food! The staff always have that fantastic SE Asian courtesy and service. Check out their lunch specials... lots of food for $5!!"}
{"text":"Worst pad thai I've ever had. Tasted like ketchup and was just full of whatever veggies they happened to have on hand - not authentic at all."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from Red Chilli. We ordered the thai vegetable salad, green curry chicken, garlic & pepper lamb, coconut rice and thai spring rolls. Every thing was absolutely delicious. The lamb was perfectly tender and flavorful, and the green curry chicken had some kick but not at all too hot, and had really good flavor. The spring rolls were crispy, super yummy and not too greasy. The delivery guy was all smiles and nice, and the food came in good time. I will definitely order from Red Chilli again, quite likely our new neighborhood go-to for thai."}
{"text":"Great prices but you get what you pay for in quality. As other reviewers have said, worst pad thai I've ever experienced in Toronto. The staff is polite and takeout quick but you can find better food just down the street."}
{"text":"It's a nice family owned restaurant with very tasty thai food. Their curry pad Thai and green curry chicken is really good along with coconut rice.   I go here every time I'm the neighbourhood, def recommend."}
{"text":"went there today and it was gross.  pad thai was watery.  and they put broccoli, celery and carrot in it.  need i say more? and the chicken was soooo gross. it was like cooked chicken.  it was absolutely disgusting.  there chili sauce was disgusting too.    we also had the basil beef, it was just ok.    oh yeah and get this - the broccoli for both our dishes were slightly yellow.  the springrolls - my dad said he liked them, but i thought it tasted old - not fresh."}
{"text":"I adore this place!! I had the best thai fresh rolls I've ever had in my life and their coconut soup was to die for! This is my favourite Thai food in the area!!! Their service is truly five star, and their menu is extensive and impressive. Check out my pictures of their food!"}
{"text":"This place is my new go to for Thai food, so I'll be going there a lot :)  We tried 5 different dishes between a few of us and by far the winner was the green curry chicken. The spicy beef was also good but just beware it's very spicy.   It's probably a cultural thing I didn' tknow about, but just beware the sticky rice is incredibly sticky. I thought it would be like japanese sticky rice but it was more like tapioca consistency so for sauce soaking purposes go with the steamed.  Grab one of their takeout menus before you order because on the back at the bottom there's a whole bunch of different deals depending on what you spend. We spent over $30 (I think that was the limit) and got a free pad thai which was delicious as well.  Oh and sorry to rant but don't let that 1 star review turn you away complaining about the curry pad thai. That was one of the dishes we got and it was very tasty. Sure the curry doesn't burn your tongue off but this is thai food, if you want strong yellow curry then go for Indian!"}
{"text":"Open again after a fire forced them to close for a while, the food is actually better than I remembered. Love the Lemon Chicken Soup, Green Curry Chicken, and Vegetable Spring Rolls. Haven't branched out much as those three are fantastic, but due to the quality I'd wager most of their dishes are fantastic. Great for take out or eating in."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai is ketchup-y and saucey, which is to my tastes. I actually dislike the \"authentic\" dry pad Thai, which some places have"}
{"text":"Good little Danforth family run restaurant. Nothing fancy, but decent tables, cleanliness, price and food quality. Great for a quick meal. Takeout available."}
{"text":"Generally decent all around. Good value, decent portions and taste that is alright. A little uninspired but tasty for what you are paying for. Pad Thai was the most uninspired, but the curries were good. Would surely go back."}
{"text":"Got the spicy chicken fried rice and while it didn't stand out to me as amazing, it wasn't bad and did fulfill my Thai craving. Portion size was large for the price, the food came out quickly, and the cashier was friendly."}
{"text":"Much better than Jean's vegetarian next door. Will be back to try again.  Friendly. Good pricing. We had the curry phad thai, noodles were a bit over cooked but that is par with every thai place I've tried in Toronto, and this was defiantly one of the better places. (Seriously why is there no good thai places in town?!). It was $12 after tax, and we were both stuffed.The flavour was good, and the chicken was tender. will be back to try more.  Second the lunch specials, will check that out."}
{"text":"Good size portions and tasty. No LLBO. chili chicken dish bit sweet. Oodles of noodles and green curry very good."}
