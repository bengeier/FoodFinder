{"text":"I really enjoy eating out at Lure Bistro, it's usually a treat for a birthday or such, because it's just a touch on the pricey side.  We we're there last night for a friends birthday (They had not had Lure before, and she left a fan, she loved her first sushi!) and we tried the Lobster Nachos for an appetizer, and they were awesome!  Fresh fried wontons, yummy guacamole, savory lobster and a delightful smokey chipotle mayo dressing that has a bit of a kick.  

Let's start at the beginning.  Valet.  Awesome.  There is a beautiful summer patio that reminds me of something out of a Hollywood movie, you walk past the outdoor bar into the reception area, scan your Belly loyalty card, and are greeted by a friendly hostess, she seats you at a well dressed table and you're waiter is prompt and tactful.  The menu is streamlined and easy to read, with prices clearly marked and ingredients fully disclosed.  Food arrives in reasonable amounts of time, and it's always delicious.  You never notice your waiter keeping your drinks full or clearing finished plates of the table, because he is a master of his profession.  You're tempted with many delicious desserts and you are welcome to stay and chat even after you've finished your meal.

The atmosphere is unique, it's like you're walking into somebodies home, but it's a restaurant, but I like it very much.    The place is dimly lit, but I feel like it is clean.  The walls are painted warm inviting colors and the decor is imaginative and playful.  It's like Cirque du Soleil, with an almost unearthly beauty.  

The only bit of constructive criticism I can give:  I wish that maki rolls were a bit bigger.  8 dollars for 6 pieces is a but much, but I don't want to sacrifice quality for quantity.  I feel like part of the cost could be eaten by giving less wasabi and ginger, because I can't imagine actually eating all that is provided. 

Over all I think lure is the best sushi place in the area, and I recommend it to anybody who loves sushi or wants to try it for the first time, because they do it very well."}
{"text":"Tuesdays are off sushi and the sushi selection as well as the fish selection is more broad than the more commercial places. The presentation is nice, the patio atmosphere with wrought iron tables and chairs shaded by umbrellas clustered around a central bar makes for a casual neighborhood hangout with good quality ingredients. Unfortunately the service is too casual and basic etiquette on how to serve dinner guests has been forgotten. I would try a different place instead of going back."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I used to come to Lure all the time and hadn't been back in years so when I heard they had a lobster special I made sure to stop in for dinner. 
The dining room service was horrible. The waitress looked like she just rolled out of bed and we barely saw her all night. We waited forever for every course and I had to hunt her down for the bill. 
The food was bland and sub par which is sad because it used to be amazing. The creme brûlée was the best part of the meal, even when ordering the lobster tail special. 
All of the staff was poorly dressed for a dining room service and acted like we were bothering them. 
This place used to be amazing and we would come for every special occasion. Now I will never come back."}
{"text":"I also like coming to Lure. Even better was the fact that every Friday and Saturday in October they have a Clambake. It was a Friday night and they wer busy as normal. We did not have a reservation but as we arrived one of groups that arrived helpfully told the server that there group would be only 5 rather than 8. That allowed us to be seated earlier than I had anticipated. Our server has prompt, courteous and effiecient.

I got the Filet Mignon Clambake. They cooked the steak medium like I ask still pink inside but not too red. THe clams were large and tasty. The friend I took with me for this visit had never had clams before. She loved them especially after they were dipped in butter. The food was excellent.

It was a liitle dark but not loud and overall another fantastic expeerience. I will continue to keep coming back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my evening at Lure. We sat at the bar and enjoyed happy hour prices- It's easy to have dinner and a drink for around $15 during happy hour. I don't eat sushi or any kind of fish/seafood, but I ordered the noodle bowl and it was fine- I've had better at places like XYZ in Cleveland, but it was good. I think I'm giving it 4 stars mostly because of the atmosphere- a casual, fun patio with friendly servers on a beautiful summer night. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Food was great, patio atmosphere great,  BUT the service absolutely stunk. They had the poor waiter Servicing 10 tables all by himself! All this work for the one later while four people stood at the podium where you walk in doing nothing but looking at their cell phones. This was about 6 p.m. during the week if there was a manager on duty he sure was doing a terrible job. Quite a shame because it usually is a very good place to go to. Will give it one more try and then forget it."}
{"text":"Probably the most disappointing sushi I've had. It seems strange to say this but the futomaki rolls are too big. You feel like you are going to choke on them because of there size. I have never had to cut rolls down but did this time. Secondly the nori paper was stringy and didn't break down appropriately when chewing. Several times I felt like it was partially down my throat and had to get it out. Lastly, the rice was extremely \"sticky.\" All around it was not a pleasant meal, and would not recommend going back. I took home leftovers but will be pitching......except for the bread and butter (those were great)."}
{"text":"I was a frequenter of Lure in the beginning.  Being that there are very few restaurants that serve sushi on the east side my family was there not long after it opened.  

I will start with this - ever since the patio has been remodeled, this is a great place to grab food and drinks during the warmer months of the year.   You won't find many outdoor patios, let alone of this caliber (ambiance wise), in the area so it's definitely worth checking out!  

Now for the hearty part - the food.  I will say that I have never been a huge fan of their sushi, but it's not awful either.  There's nothing speaking volumes to me with it, but if you're a sushi eater then this isn't a bad place to check out if you're a local and in the mood.  The appetizers are good, but portions can be pretty small, so if you're heading out for happy hour and want to grab a few bites over drinks, then this would be perfect for you.  

If you're looking for good dining experience and you're around the Willoughby/Mentor area, then I would say this should be included as an option.

P.S.  Take advantage of the valet parking!  You'll save yourself the hair pulling and walk by trying to find a parking spot in DTW."}
{"text":"The sushi is delicious. While a little pricey,  most GOOD sushi is! The service is usually sub par,  but im so busy stuffing my face,  I hardly notice. They offer half priced sushi on Tuesdays. Yes,  please! We love to go as often as we can!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were here this past week and were stoked to try the baconator roll amongst others, since I am a serious sushi lover and he has just gotten into it. 

As for the ambiance, this place must be great for outdoor patio seating because it was packed and the noise level was pretty high, so if you're looking to enjoy a nice and quiet romantic evening, I suggest eating inside (which we did). Upon being seated, we were asked for our drink order by the woman who seated us. After that, our server did not come by to take our order for maybe another 10-15 minutes...we'll choke it up to the fact that the inside was pretty empty versus outdoors where he was also tending to. 

We ordered several rolls, including the baconator, spicy tuna, bacon nigiri, Cajun seared tuna, tsunami roll, chipotle shrimp roll, chicken bacon ranch roll, and dragon roll. We also got two slices of the cheesecake to go. My boyfriend ordered a beer but it didn't come with a cold glass, in fact, it felt like a warm glass fresh out of the washer. In hindsight he said he wished he asked for a cold glass, because 5mins into pouring his beer it went warm and couldn't finish drinking it -- so, word of advice and ask for a cold glass. 

Overall, the first couple of bites of the sushi were delicious, most likely having to do with the fact we were starving. Otherwise, we would rate this as mediocre at best. The flavors of most of the rolls were just not there...very bland and dry unfortunately. We would agree that the Cajun seared tuna nigiri and the tsunami rolls were the best ones. Least favorite were the chipotle shrimp which had virtually no flavor at all and the dragon roll was seriously lacking as well. The worst part of the meal was our coffee flavored cheesecake which we ate when we got home. It tasted very bleh, perhaps because the texture seemed like it just came out of the freezer. We only got through one of the slices and tossed the other one in the trash. 

If we did not use our $100 Open Table gift certificate, we surely would have regretted the $100 check that came at the end of our meal. We will not be returning unfortunately, but at least we finally got to try a sushi roll with a piece of bacon in it."}
{"text":"I frequent this quaint restaurant in historic downtown Willoughby, and now that the weather in Cleveland appears to have taken a turn for the better, I'm greatly looking forward to Lure setting up their tiki-themed outdoor seating so I can get my chocolate martini and sushi on!

Lure is known amongst the locals for their superior sushi and its eclectic decor. I have not yet experienced the sushi chef in action via the suspended monitor, which I agree is tacky. Although I've enjoyed several entrees (of course, still tossed back a few spicy tuna rolls), I generally stick with the main attraction. One thing I will note is their ever-changing menu. I dine with some non-sushi eaters, and in my years of dining at Lure, it's not uncommon to visit twice in a 2- to 3-week period and them no longer offering an appetizer or entree as a previous visit. I once questioned our server about this and she said the owners like to try different dishes and keep things fresh. That's fine, as it almost provides for a new restaurant experience during each visit, but there's something to be said about finding that favorite dish and the anticipation of being able to enjoy it again during a future visit. A great thing about Lure, though, is that they cater to an intimate crowd and in the past have been very accomodating to making sure your dining experience is an enjoyable one. As far as sushi is concerned, I highly recommend the Bruce Lee roll (phenomenal BBQ eel) and the spicy tuna roll (Mr. Young has mastered this sushi classic). 

I actually live closer to Sushi Rock over at La Place in Beachwood, but I drive the extra 10 minutes to visit Lure. The atmosphere is a little more my style - laid back, yet sophisticated and I can forego the whole \"place to be seen\" scene that I generally avoid that seems to be the motto for Sushi Rock. Plus, I think the sushi is better (although Sushi Rock does have tasty sushi).

And, Lure's 10% coupons have certainly lured me back in (no pun intended!)."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about the sushi at Lure recently, so I wanted to give it another try. I haven't been there in over 3 years for sushi. The last time I had it there, I was not impressed. I have to say, it has been greatly improved. Better than sumo boy, better than Fuji steakhouse, way better than Young's sushi. Going back for more this summer."}
{"text":"The happy hour prices were great and the drinks were just right. I ordered the lobster nachos and they were so good. The sushi was TERRIBLE though!! The salmon nigiri looked and tasted less than fresh. The spicy salmon roll was not spicy - it was COVERED in siracha hot sauce. When I told the bartender it was way too hot to eat, he said, \"Well it is a spicy roll\". Um, since when did dousing something in hot sauce add any spice? It only adds heat! The roll was inedible. If you go, just enjoy drinks and call it a night."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area from California, where we had a great sushi place. Lure came highly recommended to us. We were exctited to check it out and possibly find our new sushi hot spot.

Not so much. After looking at the menu and asking whether they did not serve chicken teriyaki (or anything teriyaki - our two year old son's fave dish), the waiter checked with the kitchen, to inform us they \"did not have teriyaki sauce\". Huh? Should a restaurant that serves Japanese food not make their own? You know, with fresh ingredients? 
When we got our miso soup it did not come in a traditional little bowl that you sip from. Even worse, it was luke warm and bland. 
The sushi and rolls that we ordered were more of the same blandness. The rice was undercooked and the sushi (yellowtail/salmon/tuna/...) pretty tasteless and chewy. We are used to sushi that pretty much melts in your mouth.
And did I mention the flies and fruitflies buzzing around our table? Indoors on a rainy, cold day. Not something you want to see in a place that serves raw fish.

Safe to say this will not be our new sushi hang-out. The food wasn't gross, but definitely sub-par. We will continue our search."}
{"text":"Lure is very trendy... The outdoor patio is amazing (although the surroundings are not).  My boyfriend and I, who love sushi and other asian food, were not impressed with our sushi appetizer or the fish that he ordered.  Also, it was overpriced.  Although the interior is very modern and elegant, we felt cramped by others on the inside dining area because the tables are close together."}
{"text":"Really all that needs to be said is: Baconator sushi. 

But seriously, I love the sushi here. I would come here every half-price Tuesday if I could. Julie is the best server!! Very attentive but not at all intrusive or annoying. I have yet to be disappointed by anything I have ordered. With that being said, I have never tried their entrees other than sushi (and of course their AYCE crab legs in the summer). Great atmosphere, love sitting outside! A must-try, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great patio!  Food was pretty good too.  Try the calamari with Graham cracker crust and sweet curry sauce.  Fairly decent selection of wines as well."}
{"text":"I have a tendency to sit at the bar when I can because most times service is faster. This concept proved to be untrue on my recent visit here. 

My friend and I chose to sit at the bar on the patio and what a cute patio they have. We each ordered a glass of house wine during happy hour and I enjoyed their house cab very much. We each also ordered the red and white sangria which was delicious. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer but after waiting roughly a half hour we decided the bartender forgot to put in our order. When we asked about it she said the kitchen was backed up and that it would be out shortly and within a few minutes it was out (we know she forgot about it because when i went inside to go to the bathroom no one was inside dining and there were only about 6 tables outside of people). We also ordered the Lure burger and the Luau maki roll. The maki roll was okay but nothing about it really popped out. The tuna was great but it lacked the punch of flavor I was hoping it would have. 

The bartender stopped coming by after we got our food. We were going to order another drink each but she seemed to busy chatting with people she knew than to see if we needed anything else. We ended up just getting our check and going to another bar for drinks.

Maybe next time I'll try sitting at a table..."}
{"text":"Went here for a light dinner on a Saturday evening. The service was good, very fast. We ordered the hummus appetizer and salads. The food was mediocre. They serve hard cracker like bread with the hummus which was disappointing. I hear the sushi is great so perhaps we ordered the wrong food. The restaurant itself was very nice but there were people dining in sweatpants and I found it very odd for a place that is slightly more upscale."}
{"text":"Lure Bistro: too noisy, honeycomb, slow service

*Edamame - Sea Salt Crusted Soy Bean Pods Served Warm

Of note: Candied Bacon Martini - Bacon Infused Vodka, Apple Brandy, Amaretto, Maple , Candied Bacon"}
{"text":"My friend and I had dinner last night. It was 90 degrees so we opted to sit inside, we were sat right in front of the window. There was 2 dead flies on the window sill who joined us for dinner. After around ten minutes of sitting there, we were not greeted by anyone. Finally a gentlemen showed up and poured us some water, but not after replacing both our water glasses three (3) times because they were dirty! 

We ordered the crab cakes (exceptional) philly roll and lure roll (fine) baconator and slim jim rolls were a little too overpowering for my taste but my date enjoyed them. For dinner we had the surf and turf roll and the cajun (topped with seared tuna). The fillet was rare and chewy, had to spit mine out in my napkin. I enjoyed the cajun, the dinner was pricey but I was stuffed. 

There were several flies and multiple (what looked like) fruit flies buzzing around for the entire dinner. I was constantly having to shew them away to protect my food. After we ate our apps I pointed out the infestation out to the server, showing the fruit flies swimming in my soy sauce and asked for her to move our seat. Once we moved the flies were no longer a problem (except in the restroom) but the fruit flies were also buzzing around our new seats. This bug problem is serious and I have never seen anything like it in a restaurant. I'm tempted to call the health inspector.

My date was dissatisfied with the server. I'm used to busy, trendy restaurants, so for me she was OK. She was accommodating and friendly. He felt that she didn't notify the manager as she said she would about the bug problem because he never came by. Also she spent 90% of her time on the patio (in or out please).

So, went to their website and left a short message about the bugs and I felt the manager was very condescending. I wont be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an early  dinner outside on Friday.  We both wanted something light so my wife ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer, with a side of barley and I ordered the Baconater Maki sushi.  We both ordered a cocktail, my wife ordered a gin and tonic and i ordered Jim Beam on the rocks.  Both cocktails were done expertly.  Our waiter, whom we had on our many visits to  the Lure , took care of us as always and provided excellent service.
Our appetizers came out along with some freshly baked bread and butter.  The coconut shrimp was done to perfection and the barley was excellent. The Baconator Maki Sushi was very tasty  and the presentation was really appealing.  The plate came with shaved ginger and a sampling of wasabi.
I would highly recommend any of their sushi dishes.
My wife order a desert of lemon berry sorbet, but the dish came out with vanilla ice cream because they were out of the lemon sorbet.  The desert was excellent.  My wife loved the fresh berries and chocolate syrup  with the vanilla ice cream.
I have never been disappointed when dining at the Lure.  It is a fun place to dine, whether it be inside or outside.  The service has always been great."}
{"text":"I don't normally 5 star a spot when I haven't had the food, but Lure's patio is awesome enough of a draw that I think it alone is a draw. Lure knows what it is doing when it comes to outdoor dining. It's massive patio houses a huge bar under a pavilion. Plus, the patio is one of the most appealing I have seen in all of the Cleve; using overhead strands of lights to set the mood. The staff is extremely friendly, loving the fact my friend, searching for the term Buttery Nipple to describe his desired shot, blurted out \"buttery crotch\" by mistake. I don't even know if buttery nipple is the correct term because I am against any non straight-up liquor shots (like tequila. vodka. whiskey). The beer selection is decent, serving Lake Erie Monster and Magic Hat #9.  It also has long island iced teas and margaritas on tap. Yeah, I didn't know that could be done either, but I liked it."}
{"text":"Our friends along with my husband and I were looking for a restaurant in the area that had clam bakes. After reading in a local news flyer about Lures menu, we decided to give them a try so I made a reservation for 7:15. We arrived on time, but ended up standing and waiting for our table for 10 minutes. I chalked it up to the fact that they were probably packed. When we were finally led into the restraint I could see a lot of empty tables so I wasn't quite sure what the hold up was all about. After we were seated we waited another 10 minutes for our waiter. This seemed to be the theme for the night. Our friends and my husband ordered the clambakes, each with a different entre. I ordered the filet since I'm not a big fan of clams. The first dish that came out was the clam chowder. It seemed like they made it right there and then because it took almost 15 minutes to bring it out. According to my friends and hubby, it was quite delicious. All the food was good except for a few things. One of our friends got the crab legs with her bake. She asked for hot melted butter, but they were all cold. So cold that they started to congeal. The biggest disappointment, however were the corn fritters. They were pure salt balls. So bad that it burned my throat. We mentioned it to our waiter and he relayed the message to the chef. When our waiter came back he said that the chef tasted them, agreed wholeheartedly and blamed it on his sous chef. We were told by our waiter to come back next week when he was sure they would be much better! Not a we are so sorry, let me take some money off your bill, or offer us something else. Lure, to us, was always the place to go for a great dinner and beyond excellent service. Not really that place anymore. If I'm going to put out that much money for food, I expect excellent food and top notch service."}
{"text":"Overall a good 3.5 star dining experience.  The rosemary chicken pirogies in a smoked Gouda cream sauce were rich and delicious.  My pear salad with grilled chicken was very good.  The boyfriend's seaweed salad was good but he said he's had better sushi at other places.  Service was attentive.  Perhaps my fave part of the meal was the bread they brought to the table...the multigrain bread (with a slightly sweet butter) was killer good.  I was shocked when she said it was Orlando bread.  Huge outdoor dining area and bar.  Great weeknight specials like Date Night Wednesday menu for $40."}
{"text":"We have been to Lure many times and are always happy. This review is specific to a July evening on the patio with a group of 8. My husband and I both had the walleye and thought it was amazing. The only problem was that they messed up and brought us our walleye first, and the other 6 people at our table did not get their food. They admitted that they messed up and the walleye was actually for another table. So we ate and our friends and family sat there watching us eat. Then they finally got their food 30 minutes later and we were done, so we sat there and watched them eat. It was not ideal. The manager did apologize but nothing was really offered to us to make up for it. Not really sure how I feel about going back now, at least not for a while."}
{"text":"BEST HAPPY HOUR MENU EVER!  If you can belly up to the bar between 4 pm and 7 pm, you have the opportunity to get half price sushi and a host of great mix-n-match bar foods.  I absolutely love the potstickers and blue crab hushpuppies.  YUM!

My girl and I polished off 2 rolls of sushi (12 pieces), 6 oysters on the half shell, 2 oyster shooters, a big plate of truffle oil fries w/ rosemary mayo, 6 potstickers, 3 tall draft beers (pyramid hefeweizen) and 3 martinis (she loves girly drinks) for a grand total of $60.  Not bad price wise. 

This, added to the fact that we sat outside on the patio and could enjoy the sunshine between plates of yummy food being served to us, really made the afternoon!

The only downside is parking!  No lot for Lure and the furniture place next door will have you towed.  Plenty of parking in the street, but you might have to walk a bit."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance.  Had a rather large group with 2 small kids and they did fine.  Kids menu was just right."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! I took my friends who love sushi visiting from out of town here. It was delicious and the rolls were creative and well put together. Not to mention the plates were beautifully put together. The wait staff was very prompt and polite. I can't wait to go back and try a new roll next time I visit!"}
{"text":"I got the all you can eat sushi and crab legs. yes you read that right. they have all you can eat sushi AND crab legs. Had a couple sushi rolls and then started on the crab legs. Waitress was awesome. very knowledgeable for our friends that came and were on some weird diet. She know what they could eat and what they couldn't. Just remember saying that it was rare to understand what they eat. We were with a party of 8 that sat on the patio. Everyone left with smiles as everything was amazing about the evening."}
{"text":"Located in Downtown Willoughby, Lure Bistro is an interesting little place for more upscale food on the far northeast suburbs of Cleveland. I haven't been there in years since they were doing the \"all you can eat\" sushi, but decided to meet some old friends for dinner last night. The food itself was pretty good, but there were some bizarre aspects of the dining experience that warrant three stars. 

The dining room is very intimate, modern, interesting artful touches. There is a sushi chef in the corner, and they broadcast him making sushi on a suspending flat screen monitor that hangs above the sushi bar -- It was kind of tacky. I really do not need to monitor the preparation of my sushi before it makes it to the table. Also, the service was weird even though we were ordering full on appetizer, drinks, entrees, dessert, the full deal. The server was highly attentive in the beginning of the meal and very sweet, but seemed to poop out toward the end, nearly disappearing. We ordered two teas, one herbal and one caffeinated, and we were brought one caffeinated pot to share, no sugar spoons. Also, our entrees arrived before our salads/appetizers were cleared so there was a weird moment of \"where does everything go?\" 

Despite the quirks in the service, the meals were quite delicious, and because we paid in cash we received a gift card for 10% of our bill. (A promotion they are running currently).

Overall, a good off-Erie St. option if you are in the Willoughby area, can tolerate service that is not 100% impeccable, and you want to patronize locally owned non-chain establishments."}
{"text":"Solid but not great.  My wife ordered sushi and it was good...but didn't knock our socks off.  I believe she would give the meal 3.5 out of 5.  We'd give it overall 3 of 5 stars.  I ordered the short ribs and I'd give that 4.5 of 5 starts.  Very tender and tasty.  I also ordered a spicy tuna roll and asked for extra spicy...but that was not at all spicy.  I'd give that 3 of 5 stars.

I ordered a Jack Daniels with a splash of coke...that was 5 of 5 stars.  Service was good in the beginning...but we waited an extended time without our server for the back half of our meal.  I would have ordered another drink if the server came back to us.  We eventually had to ask someone to bring our bill.  We got there at 8:00 PM and we didn't get our bill till 9:45.  

So that is the main reason I've given them 3 stars instead of 4 of 5 stars is the lack of follow up after we received our meal."}
{"text":"Baconater sushi was different and delicious, something you don't normally see. Wasn't a fan of calamari, it was more a maple sweet sauce but I prefer spicy or marina or something of that sorts. Not a huge sushi eater but what we got tasted good the lox and salmon bagel sushi and spicy tuna, the place has a huge outdoor area which looks like it would be awesome in summer and inside had a cute feel to it the decorations were just enough that it wasn't too much. For non seafood eaters I saw some things on the menu such as pork belly and chicken paparkash. Would like to go back and try something other than sushi as well."}
{"text":"The Sushi is very good especially if it is on Tuesday when many of the choices are half price.
The atmosphere is very nice, but can be very noisy when busy.
Our biggest gripes are first the parking. Downtown Willoughby in general is a mad house on any night. Willoughby lacks convenient parking and is very patron unfriendly. Most parking is either very limited with many areas listed as no parking or valet only. The other problem is that when you come to downtown Willoughby and find a space in a parking lot it will usually say for XXXXXX business and that all others will be towed.
The other problem is that after planing to go to Lures for over a week we called them and they never mentioned that Reservations were recommended. When we got there at about 5:00pm on a Tuesday and finally found a parking space 2-1/2 blocks away we were told that there would not be any tables until 8:30pm. This was despite the fact that most of the restaurant was empty and my wife and I are relatively fast eaters and do not dawdle at the table. It is pretty bad when a restaurant can not fit two people in during a weeknight at 5:00pm. They have very limited space in the dining room and I do not know why we were not offered a seat at the bar.
It will be a long time before I bring my family or business clients back to Lures."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi spots in Cleveland area. Beautiful outdoor patio with full bar. Cool bar inside with giant 10ft long fish tank. Great place for a date or girls night out. They offer valet parking."}
{"text":"Great food bit light on portions for the price but taste is great.  Call ahead of you want a seat thou"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my trip to Lure. Our service, food & drinks were all fantastic and the outdoor patio was great for a summertime meal. I recommend the cucumber and watermelon salad - cool, sweet and refreshing.

We did encounter a bit of hassle from management when trying to use a Yelp deal we had purchased, but it was remedied quickly."}
{"text":"First time at Lure. The bar was packed so the hostess got us in right away. The service was perfection. And OMG the truffle pierogies?!?! Just go there. Seriously. I will be back over and over and over. Evidently their sushi is phenomenal as well. Love Nat and Cass"}
{"text":"It pains me to give this place two stars. After looking over the menu I wanted to go to this place for so long before I finally got a chance. The bottom line was just that the food - every dish - was not so hot. The atmosphere is marvelous. The patio out front with an outdoor bar is so nice and the big fish tank at the bar inside. And the drinks we had were very good.

We got the calamari to start out with. It was alright. The calamari was a little chewy. We didn't finish it. Then we tried the ahi tuna nachos. It just didn't go together right. The flavors didn't meld. Then we tried the baconator maki roll. It is the first time I have ever had sushi I really couldn't take another bite of. However the bf ate the rest and said he thought it was ok. 

I would be willing to try this place out again. It has so much potential and quite a few good reviews on here."}
{"text":"When Lure first opened for business, it really wasn't a bad restaurant. I enjoyed going there for dinner and was always satisfied. 

The last 6 years or so have been completely different. 

Food has become sub par. Especially the sushi. I'd stay away from that if I were you. 

On summer nights, it might be fun to go here and drink at the outdoor bar and sit on the patio. It only takes 20-30 minutes to get one drink. When you do get it, it's crappy and not worth the ridiculous wait. Even when they're not busy the bar service is extremely slow, unattentive, and the bartenders are really crabby."}
{"text":"Went here Friday night wanted something that was quality in the quantity took my gbf and we asked a few questions and I saw they had Maine lobster tacos I asked if the lobster was fresh or frozen because if you know lobster you know the difference when the food arrived it was plated nicely took a bite of the toco only to find a rubbery blah taco I asked for the manger he said the lobster is fresh frozen so their you go"}
{"text":"The meal saved the rating on this one.

I went with a good friend of mine for all you can eat crab. We arrived 45 minutes prior to the kitchen closing and while the bar was full one three groups including ourselves were having crab. Initially our order was forgotten and the bartender claimed I had not ordered; I did and even the girl sitting a couple seats down from us heard me and confirmed.

After we made it through this the crab was really very good and came out quick. Towards the end however my buddy still had crab and while taking a quick call his plate and crackers, utensils were taken and the crab left behind. The bartender then claimed he had not taken them away, very strange.

In closing the bar is a tight fit. The crab was really good and the service needs work."}
{"text":"Lure is one of the top places for sushi on the East side of Cleveland, in my book. Tuesdays are half off nights - great deal, but be sure to make a reservation.

Summer evenings are great to spend outside, eating very fresh sushi and sipping on a cocktail. Fun patio for big groups!

Inside has a great, modern atmosphere for date nights. I also love their cash program."}
{"text":"Worth the half hour drive! 
Is not a secret that Lure's focus is seafood. I'm just not that into seafood, but I still drove from Cleveland Heights to Willoughby to give this restaurant a try. Oh, was I pleased... I had a butternut squash bisque that was very flavorful, and surprisingly large. And then I got my burger. Holy Beef! It was probably the best, the juiciest and the biggest burger I've ever had. It was made from Ohio beef, topped with an egg and served on a pretzel bun with bacon-mayonnaise. I could not finish that burger, even though I sure tried. The rolls seemed to be perfect and I heard \"outstanding\", \"amazing\" and \"sooo good\" used to reference them while I was there, but I did not try any. Shame on me. I may try them next time (and there will be a next time). 

The service was excellent and the food was brought promptly. Beyond the wine, they have a good beer selection. Oh, and FYI, they have complementary valet parking. I didn't realized it and parked elsewhere. Don't miss it.

{"text":"Lure has been a part of our normal going out date nights with my husband since we have been married. We stopped coming here for a while because service had been a problem and inside was dirty so we only came when we could sit on the patio. 
I met my girlfriends up here last week and we had reservations. The table was ready right away and the server was there as soon as we all sat. He was right on ball. 
We all had sushi for dinner with a couple drinks. I did have to use the bathroom and had the opportunity to go inside again. Very clean now. The place has turned around in every aspect. The place has an amazing tiki style themed patio and even on a week night draws a large crowd. 
Our sushi came out and of course was delicious. We ate every single  peace ! 
A must go place for summer patio dining."}
{"text":"A great find for gluten free dining (and regular dining as well)! Excellent seafood, beef, and salad options. In warm weather, there's pleasant outdoor dining and live low-key music and a great happy hour. They have a separate gluten free menu and even offer gluten free beer and hard cider as part of a good selection of beer and wines."}
{"text":"Really great place for sushi. Had the opportunity to go with friends and sit outside enjoy the nice weather in June. Food was good as we did some apps and sushi outside. Drinks were ok... I've had better. Good service and the free Valet is nice touch."}
{"text":"3 Stars is A Ok... which is what this place is.  Okay.   GF and I went on a Wed night.  Service seemed off --Hipster, stoner type server seemed confused.   Everyone has off days.   I had Sushi and she had orange roughy.   The roughy looked and tasted great.... HUGE portion... part of it was undercooked (the fish flesh had that gelatinous/clear look in the thickest part).  My sushi was \"okay\".

I love the atmosphere - but think this would be best as a summer patio place for appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"We had a really nice experience at lure Bistro this late summer. We had a party at 12 that sat outside underneath the patio lights. Our server was more than attentive enough his feet also was able to joke around with us hanging around to help us take some photos and preserve our evening. It was one of my friends birthdays. The people that own lure Bistro also own a restaurant called The Square bistro in downtown Sheridan. My Hope was because I don't eat sushi that they will replicate one of the recipes that Market Bistro had which was a sushi style roll but with beef in it. While the chef was more than willing to accommodate he advised he did not have the same ingredients as the Square bistro in Chardon therefore he would not be able to adequately replicate that role and did not want to try something new on such short notice. I completely agreed and understood. Our drinks came quickly as did our food and everything is made to order with zero mistakes. Those are pretty good odds when you have a party at 12. Because it was my friend's birthday they actually count in a desert and again our server met and exceeded all of our expectations. Lure Bistro is still a great place to go in downtown Willoughby and it's carved out its own niche of restaurants and will be there for many years to come."}
{"text":"I dunno, I'm not a rich person- I'm in college. But lure is the best sushi I've had on the east side. The menu is adventurous, melding things like peanuts, and even bacon into sushi. If you get takeout, or even come on certain days there are deals to be had too, such as by one get one free on takeout rolls.  I'm not saying it isn't overpriced, you can get comparable things at Young's sushi just down the street for significantly less, and much more attention. 

 I enjoy it though, in the summer the outdoor bar is pretty amazing as well.   I basically always opt for the bar be it the indoor, or the outdoor. My boyfriend and I tried the dining room once and it was just too stuffy. Lure get's the basics of sushi spot on every time, but to be really impressed try something that you just are completely unsure about- 90% of the time you'll find a new favorite."}
{"text":"I have been to The Lure Bistro a few times. The food is very good. The sushi is so fresh and good. The crab legs are the best...and at a great price for AYCE...$38. I LOVE the AYCE sushi also. I recommend making reservations."}
{"text":"So disappointed. ..we came to Lure Bistro to celebrate a special occasion and since it was a pleasant evening sat on the patio. Imagine our SHOCK and disgust as the people seated near us were SMOKING! When we inquired as to whether this was within the parameters of the \"no smoking in a place of employment law\" we were told it was. Regardless we will not be back...smoke and seafood just don't mix."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times usually in the summer to take advantage of the large patio. The best thing about Lure is their half-price sushi night and that's just because of the price. Having lived in Japan for five years I can tell you what makes good sushi and what doesn't.  The rice they use at Lure is often undercooked and has no \"su\" or sushi vinegar flavor.  The Rainbow Roll we had on Friday night did not look or taste fresh.  I honestly think it was the worst sushi I've ever tasted.
The night really started off bad when we ordered red wine and it came out hot.  The waitress was nice enough about exchanging it, but said, \"We thought it might be a little warm since it was inside and not outside\"- it was an 80 degree day!  Wouldn't the outside be warmer than the air-conditioned inside?
We also ordered the scallop entree for $20.  Much to my surprise there were only 3 scallops.  They were wrapped in bacon and cooked perfectly, but I've been to more upscale restaurants and gotten more than 3 scallops for $20.
Lure is a great place to go and sit out on the patio and enjoy a few drinks, but I wouldn't recommend coming just for the food- you'll be disappointed and upset you paid so much for the quality of food you got."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Lure Bistro for the first time last night for 1/2 price sushi Tuesdays. 
I ordered a spicy tuna roll, smoked salmon roll, and a crustacean roll. The spicy tuna roll was bland and tasteless. The smoked salmon roll was very good. Its a philly roll with a extra kick. The crustacean roll was alright. I found a piece of lobster shell in my roll but besides that pretty good. 
My husband ordered the the baconator roll and he is completely obsessed now lol 
For dessert I gave the Creme Brulee sampler a try. It was disappointing because it wasnt actually \"bruleed\" on the top. Just one note texture with the fruit on top. It was still very tasty. All and all it was a decent date night"}
{"text":"Sushi at Lure is phenomenal. I've yet to be disappointed with it, however, I wouldn't recommend this place to someone who is not a sushi/seafood lover because options are limited in scope. It makes me happy that they have a very large wine list..they are one of the few DTW restaurants with a good selection. Service has always been very good as well. My ONLY issue is that I typically only visit Lure when it is nice out because the patio is really the main event here in terms of atmosphere. The inside is sad, small, and confusing, I'd be interested to see how the business does when patio weather dies down. Other than that, great food, great wine, great service."}
{"text":"A big *shrug* for Lure from us.  A paste of Siracha and mayo seems to drive their \"Asian fusion\" menu but the concoctions just don't seem to work for us.  We found many of the fusion items more nauseating than pleasant - an example of the end result not coming out better than the sum of its parts.

Hard to attest to the freshness as most of the things served to us were drenched in some creamy or heavy buttery sauce.  I can say the oysters-on-the-half-shell ($24.00/dz) and the hamachi (yellowtail) nigiri ($7.00/2 pcs) were definitely fresh tasting. 

Probably the best part of our dinner in taste and surprise were the ahi poke nachos appetizer ($9.00)!  If there's anything that'd bring us back to Lure it would be this appetizer and was a +1 star to this review!

Quail egg (raw) shooter ($2.50).... hmm, won't order that again.  It was just an unimpressive raw egg mixture.   Oyster shooter ($3.00), it is what it is - alcohol inundates everything.  I'll just stick to the oysters-on-the-half-shell which were good just by themselves (with lemon juice).  Although I prefer a more Japanese flavor to this delicacy like what other traditional Japanese restaurants do instead of cocktail sauce.

My wife's crab-encrusted grouper entree ($25.00) was a mess of fish and crust that tasted like and had a consistency of a bland omelet with a side of polenta that had even less flare than porridge.  Totally disappointing.

Lobster chowder ($7.00) was pleasantly stocked full of lobster meat and tasted good.

Mushroom pierogis ($8.00) were simply too saucy and dumped full of cream.  Bad.

The rest of us stuck to the sushi menu - $15 for \"two-timing tuna\" roll (futo maki) and another $15 for a \"lobster popper\" roll.  OK, again with the freekin' mayo sauce on rice?  The tuna was definitely better than the lobster salad option, though, if I had to choose.  Unless Option C is available...

Yes, someone just had to order the bacon sushi ($3.00/2 pcs)!  And yes, it was just crisp bacon on rice.  Thankfully the bacon sashimi wasn't ordered which is literally just a piece of crisp bacon.

I have to admit the lemonade ($2.00) was delicious!! LOL!

Desserts were pleasantly surprising: coconut cheesecake ($6.00), creme brulee ($6.00), and German chocolate tart ($6.00).  Non-Asian but the better part of our dinner!

Although I prefer traditional Japanese cuisine, that doesn't mean I can't be wow'd by Asian fusion.  But whereas traditional cuisine generally has relatively strict rules about how things are supposed to taste, the creative freedom and lack of these rules can make or break \"fusion\" cuisine.  And fusion just doesn't work here at Lure."}
{"text":"With my family on the far east side, I've grown to know that modern/fancy restaurants are hard to come by out that way. There may be a few here and there, but for the most part, they're all pretty laid-back, family spots. Lure Bistro is the exception, and a great one at that.

My first and only experience at LB was a great one this past winter. This means I unfortunately didn't get to experience the awesome patio that everyone raves about. But trust me, the snowy atmosphere didn't take away from the warm, tasteful dining experience inside. 

The inside was a chic, modern feel warmed up by the attentive and friendly staff. Big smiles, and very talkative: my favorite kind of server. Each member of the staff looked genuinely happy to be there. Our server gave this indecisive gal a lot of suggestions and helped me pick out my very large meal. He even mentioned a particular wine that he'd thought my party would enjoy, we took his advice and agreed. Yum. 

The food was great, not the best, but innovative with unique twists. It was also aesthetically pleasing. I mean, it needs to look delicious and this presentation was awesome. We absolutely loved the goat cheese appetizer and the crab salad. I think I'd probably stick to apps for future visits. 

Overall, the service shined and the food was good. I'd definitely come back in the summer months to check out the patio. Would I drive out from Cleveland just to go there? Naw. But if I were in the area, I'd certainly drop by for a bite to eat on the east side."}
{"text":"Another interesting, off the beaten path but not quite good restaurant in Willoughby. The night we went they were running a chef-special where the chef picked your 3 course meal - an interesting way to be adventurous and try something new. It was actually quite good.

I on the other hand, had one of the sushi dinner specials, which came with a soup, seaweed salad and spicy sushi. It was pretty good until I got home and stomach pains kept me up all night. I used to eat sushi (or think about getting it) almost daily and a few months later I still can't touch it. Not sure if it was the spice or something else. Sad, because it's almost summer and this place has a lovely outdoor patio that would a perfect place to spend a summer evening, with a lovely salmon dish and glass of wine."}
{"text":"Their sushi is 3 stars at best. This rating is for my favorite meal: crab legs. Thursday night, Lure does all you can eat crab legs. Our server was awesome. Funny, polite and attentive. However, no one tops bumpers for crab legs in the area."}
{"text":"I lived in Willoughby and have never ventured in to Lure until now. They only have later hours but it was worth the trip. I ordered a miso and a couple of maki rolls, not to die for but defiantly hits the spot. Lure is a little bit more pricey but I used the Yelp deal, $10 for $20 gift certificate so it wasn't as painful of a check (without alcohol). I don't think I would make this a frequent go to though."}
{"text":"I really love coming here on Tuesdays for half priced sushi! Always great every time!"}
{"text":"Was told my patio reservation would be an hour wait, so we took a table inside. Fifteen minutes after the waiter took our drink order he came back to the table to ask us what did we order, he had forgot, but he did let us know that he could take our drink and food order at the same time. If I wanted to order my food and drink together I could have gone to Arby's, I went to Lure hoping to have a couple of rolls and some nagiri along with a drink or two, so I decided \"for facks sake\" got up and left. We did have a great meal at Ballentine down the street with outstanding wait staff."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for crab legs and since my last experience with pickled bills was awful my buddy suggested Lure Bistro for the all you can eat crab special on Thursday. I am so glad that I listened to him.

Me and my party of 5 got a reservation and came here at 8:25pm; and we had a reservation inside, but since it was so nice we asked if we could hangs that to outside and they accommodated us and got us seated within 10 min. The hostess definitely needs some props for that one.

We sat down at a corner table near the bar and were approached by an awesome waiter. Unfortunately I don't remember his name but he was quick to take our drink orders and explain the all you can eat crab legs and sushi special ($43.00) and that we could have both sushi and crab and which section of the menu to order sushi rolls from. I personally was not interested in sushi but ordered a roll anyways, and asked for the crab legs (along with 3 of my buddies who ordered the same). I also ordered a double shot of Jameson, which was poured very generously and came out to $12.00 for the double shot.

Once the crab legs started coming I was sold on this place. They come out steaming hot and with butter and they taste fresh. And you don't have to keep asking them to bring more by because the waiter brings you another plate once you finish your previous one. Now that's service!! I only ate like 6 servings of crab legs and my buddies ate 15 and 12 respectively so they totally got the whole tables money's worth; and again they were delicious and steaming every time they brought them out.

The crab legs were delicious, the drinks were poured generously, the service was top notch; but the one downside is I wasn't the biggest fan of their sushi; but I guess that's just me.

Will definitely come here for the AYCE crab legs."}
{"text":"Update: Stick with drinks and sushi. We went back for anniversary dinner and ordered off the regular/lent menu. The dishes were a bit hit or miss. 

Starters: Fish soft tacos and the calamari. The fish soft tacos were spot on and amazing. There was enough to share as a starter, but it could have easily doubled as an entree. The calamari was good, but could have been a lot better. The slices are cut a bit too thick, so they came out a little on the chewy side. Also, the graham cracker dusting didn't get truly crisp in the frying process and the dish really need something crunchy to balance the squid. 

Entree: My husband got the lobster dinner. It was ok. The lobster was cooked a little unevenly, so some of it was great, and other parts a little over done. I had the special fish (that night the John Dory). I dont know if this fish has a lot of pin bones, or if the seasoning wasn't cooked through all the way, but every couple of bites I took I bit into something a little crunchy, almost like when you get a piece of sand or grit wen eating clams. It was not pleasant considering the fish was cooked well and had decent flavor. 

Dessert: We shared the Death by Peanut Butter. This is a must if you like dense rich peanut buttery goodness. It had just enough chocolate in the dish to balance but not take away from the peanut butter flavor. Its enough for two to share, but you may not want to! 

We will definitely come back, but most likely just stick with the tried and true!"}
{"text":"Very happy with our food at Lure! Def a gem for cute, quaint Willoughby. No rez on a Tues (half-price sushi) so the manager (part owner as we found out later) asked us if we could eat in an hour in a peeved tone?? Many other ways a professional could have phrased this :) Our server seemed depressed and only after the two of us ordered lots of food and drinks was she a little more lively... sigh. The food made up for it for the most part:

Oysters and oyster shooters were good.
Firemouth specialty roll was AMAZING.
Surf and Turf Specialty roll was decent.
Nigiri yellow tail and salmon were of great quality and quantity.
Spicy tuna - okay
Martinis were great.
Presentation: beautiful.
$70+ for two

Looking forward to visiting again, but might run if I get the same server."}
{"text":"Sushi was really good. Waiter was friendly. Atmosphere was very pretty on the patio with the lights. They had a band playing tonight that was very good. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"A hidden treasure in Willoughby.  We like to go on specials nights/days to get a good sampling of sushi rolls and such.  The service has always been spot on and attentive even during the most busiest times.  I love the place so much I had my b-day party there (12-14 people)  the place was CRUSHED that day as I picked a 1/2 price day because my family isn't as adventurous as I am with sushi so I wanted them to sample a bunch of different kinds. (even got mom and dad to try eel)   even though  the places was crushed our server did his best to keep it together,  there was a couple of minor errors they were quickly remedied.  On the negative side the dinning room is TOO LOUD !!  we're talking echo chamber here!  wood floors, plain vaulted ceilings and the icing on the cake glass top tables !!  They have since added table cloths on the tables but that room NEEDS some artsy sound absorbing fabric hanging from the ceiling and maybe some tapestries  on the walls !!  We have dined outside and I hate eating outside but in the summer its the only option on 1/2 price roll day as the bar is closed.  If you sit at the bar you're more than likely going to have a new BFF ....a fly (or 2)  Also choose a seat away from the sink or bar trashcan....flys love um.   BTW, for those who are meat eaters I have dined with those who have had the burgers and got a thumbs up from all of them !"}
{"text":"Been here over 40 times.  I have learned from experience that the entire menu is fabulous besides the SUSHi.  The sushi is in the lowest tier of the entire cleveland area.  Get anything else on the menu and you will enjoy.  The rice is nasty and if you go to half price sushi night take a minute and watch the cooks/sushi chefs make your food.  You will not eat it. I will say I have always had exceptional service from the table servers. Good luck getting a drink from any of the 2 bars. They are extremely snotty..."}
{"text":"Helpful hostess as out party size changed and needs shifted to be out of Sun. Patio looked nice if shaded table available. Check specials on website. Lure had snow crab legs and sushi specials on Thursday. One sushi roll and seaweed salad was dinner.  Roll was good though I like a crunchy roll to be crunchy. Service was good. Attentive to our group of 6."}
{"text":"Best night to go is half price sushi night on Tuesdays. Good way to be able to try a couple new items at a good price. Outside patio is nice to sit on in the summer!!"}
{"text":"Ordered tempura shrimp maki roll at the bar $2 off at happy hour. Was pretty good. Drinks were pored to standard. We were then seated in dining room which to me presentation is everything. Their sushi bar window had meat wrapped in saran wrap thought it was a very unprofessional look. It was ayce crab leg night which it seemed a lot of people were ordering and I wish now I would have ordered that too.But the price was ridiculous (go to Bumpers instead!) I ordered Short ribs with green tea soba noodles. I've had short ribs before but this was so fatty by time I picked it all off there was nothing left of the meat! The noodles were so salty I wanted to poor my water on it to calm it down! Loved the herb butter and bread! (Probably the best part of our meal sad to say) My boyfriend had chicken marsala with mashed potatoes and green beans. The green beans were good. Bland chicken just not good and that is their best (land entree seller). May be back for sushi but really wasn't impressed at all!"}
{"text":"Top notch food and service. Went here for dinner last night w/a party of six. Ordered the coconut shrimp app while waiting for the rest of our party. Was four very large piece of shrimp and was delicious. Also ordered the lobster nachos. Chips were so fresh and the overall dish was good, but the lobster was served cold (almost like a slaw) and was all in the middle of the bowl. I pictured something warm and a little more creamy. Wasn't bad at all, but wouldn't order again. 

For dinner we had sushi - tsunami and volcano rolls. Amazing! Friends ordered sushi as well - all were pleased. There was a little mix up in one of the dishes served (and one of our meals was served 10 minutes or so before everyone else ... but only bc she was the only one who didn't order sushi) and they apologized and comped the table a wonderful dessert. We didn't even complain - they went out of their way to do it for us. That's amazing service and a reason to give them five stars in itself. We usually frequent Square Bistro, but we love them both!!"}
{"text":"Myself and 3 friends visited Lure Bistro on Wed. August 20th 2014, We sat at there outside bar (Very nice). Very nice entertainment. Only 2 of us ordered food.we split their twin lobster tails w/asparagus, The lobster was very chewy with a bad after taste, the  asparagus was old( The twin lobster tails was not on the menu). The Bartender/server kept apologizing over and over. She might of meant well but it was nerve racking. Finally the manager Dave came out. To tell us he was sorry about the meal. Mind you most all of the meal was on the plate. He said sorry about the quality but there is nothing I can do. So! I paid for a meal I didn't eat.
We were all shocked at his attitude. The refusal to ask if we wanted anything else. I paid the bill in full and we all left."}
{"text":"I freakin love this restaurant! The ambiance is great- there is both inside and outside seating, sort of a nice bar and a bistro mixed together. The service is great, the waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable. The food is decently priced and delicious. There's a wide selection of food including a sushi menu! Ok I'm really skeptical of non Asian sushi restaurants but I took a risk and WOW there sushi is great! I had the tsunami roll- it was so good! Also tried the crab cakes and crab crusted grouper. We finished all of our meals. The drinks are good as well. Try the lemon chiffon martini! I will definitely go back and I'd recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"We have gone a few times for 1/2 price sushi. Their sushi menu is very limited without many \"real\" sushi options. For example spicy salmon is a staple at every sushi restaurant I have been to -- they do not have one. Very few of their sushi options actually have raw fish. I was disappointed, and now go elsewhere if I want Sushi."}
{"text":"Three years later and I'm still happy. I should be going here more! I honestly don't know who is voting it as a top ranking sushi place though.It's extremely Americanized sushi, and I love the beautifully simple and traditional Japanese sushi. The roll they are famous for is called the Baconator for heavens sake.

Now, I went on a Wednesday and got the two course lobster dinner. I figured WHY NOT! I deserve some lobster. They really didn't skimp either, which I thought they might since it is only $25!! Paired with how well everything was prepared, it's totally worth it I even found some shell in mine, which sounds bad but it tells me it's REAL and FRESH!

p.s. The patio is great."}
{"text":"Chicken dumpling and pulled pork sliders., salt overload. Usually enjoy dinner.  Not tonight"}
{"text":"Love the half off sushi night here.  Went to try and watch a basketball game on the patio because the weather was beautiful. Walked up to the bar at 9:20 and was told the kitchen was closed. The hours say 4pm-10pm, so I assumed the kitchen would at least be open until ten. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to Lure Bistro probably 7 times.  Each time seems to be different whether it be sushi, drinks on the patio, dinner, bar crawl, or because I have a craving for a cougar...jk.  

It's a nice place, seriously, it is.  There is a fantastic patio, food is good, maybe slightly over priced for what you get.  The service on the patio is sub par at best.  I waited for 30 minutes one time and it was not busy, not even 2 deep.  Apparently there are regulars, like there is everywhere, but the simple rules of customer service need to be reinforced here.  

For the best experience, I like to go into the restaurant, hang a right, and sit at the bar.  Your wait disappears, you can sample beers, wines, and once I was able to sample some sushi.  The last couple times the bar manager / part owner was helping us out and that was a nice change, he was eagle eyed on our Lure experience.  It was safe to say, I left drunk and full.  Thanks Lure, see you at the bar this winter.  FYI...don't forget the salt and pepper."}
{"text":"Went here years ago and moved. Heard it is still open. Planning on visiting again. Great food,, decor, ambiance"}
{"text":"Looks classy place. The food is so-so. Whoever is making the sushi needs to take a sushi rice making 101 again. Several occasion the rice is very mushy and not whole. 

I had the \"Three Little Piggies\" and it was good. Very expensive."}
{"text":"Eh...I learned my lesson from prior experiences when turned away or treated poorly from the host staff, so we made a reservation this time, because in prior visits we have enjoyed their food and patio atmosphere. Being the first great Tuesday with nice weather, we were ecstatic to get a table and enjoy some half priced sushi. Sadly, we ended up being at the restaurant for 2 hours, not by any doing of our own. Of course I understand it is your busiest sushi night, but... staff appropriately, as we had never had this problem in the past. 2 rolls, 2 beers each, 2 hours! Never again! Service was very slow but nice! Food was awful, my husband had his go to favorite (in the past) surf and turf roll...which now has green and red peppers, corn, onions, and tempura
 :( not like the visual and edible art this once was, it looked and tasted more like left over Mexican food! After this experience, I hate to say, we will not be back and since they are going more toward \"Asian fusion\" you are better off checking out Ballantine but if you want real sushi...cross the street and go to Youngs."}
{"text":"I've only been here for the sushi on two occasions. The sushi isn't anything special to me but living in Orange County for nearly 8 years gives my taste buds a biased opinion. Sushi or sashimi here isn't worth the money. I did ask the itamae on both visits to create a roll of his own off the menu but he just made an item already on the sushi menu. The staff is nice in general though. 3 stars for staff, cleanliness and hometown of Willoughby."}
{"text":"Lure's Summer Patio is a true 5 Star location in this eastern suburb of Cleveland.

Lure's 1/2 Price Sushi on Tuesdays is also 5 Stars.  Great prices on good solid creative fish.  Okay...so they won't compare to Sushi czar Toshi Ueki at Blue Ribbon in NYC.  However, for Cleveland where lets face it, Chef's can't exactly go down to the docks and select their own fish, it meets and exceeds most expectations as evidenced by the great crowds who keep showing up every Tuesday

And if you want some of the best taco's you will ever taste...you MUST order the Duck Taco's.  I am not even a duck fan and I was really wow'ed by these...another 5 stars.

On the world class food scene...okay, it may only deserve 4 stars.  In Clevelands eastern suburbs for seafood & steak, especially in summer, this place really is a great place to take a date or meet with friends!"}
{"text":"Look, normally we LOVE Lure. Have been many times, always good, even take our children for sushi here and they love it.  Sat night was NOT good.
We went with another couple, we were promptly seated outside per our reservation. Drinks came in an adequate time.  We were catching up and not in a rush and we explained that the server, who seemed to be busy.
We ordered apps, and they came out pretty quickly.  They were good.  Got the perch tacos (special), the coconut shrimp and the Florida tacos with grouper. We also oreder our entrees at the same time, which I am always reluntant to do, but the rest of the table was for it. I ordered the scallops on the regular menu, NOT A SPECIAL.  SO in my mind, the kitchen should know how to make this one rather well. I asked for them to be done to a medium rare, and not be over cooked.  I order scallops A LOT, and know over cooking makes them tough and rubberly.
Food comes, first cut into them with a my fork and I can already tell they are WELL DONE, or sat under the heat lamp while we finished our apps.  :(  I stopped the manager, and explained, she was quick to whisk them away and have them redone.  She offered me a cocktail while I was waiting and I took her up on it.  The scallops were returned to me in a about ten minutes. Cut into them, seemed to be moist and mid-rare, only to taste the center and they were ICE COLD!  ICE! I immediately grabbed the manager AGAIN, and told her I was done.  I did not want them \"trying\" again.  She asked me if I wanted anything else, and my guests talked me into ordered sushi.  I ordered the eel Nigiri roll (2 peices per order), and while it took what seemed to be a long time to make sushi, they arrived with 4 on the plate.  She says \"I had them make you more\".  While that is fine, I ate three, and my husband finished the 4th, as everyone was already done with their meals.
When we got the bill, she charged me for all 4 rools, even though I only ordered the two.  She rang it for the kitchen obviously, but never removed.  When I asked for it to be removed, they did indeed take both off, even though I would have paid for the one I ordered.  All in all, not a good experience.  Very disappointed, and will probably only go back now for sushi, which always seems to be done very well, and always fresh."}
{"text":"Was there for AYCE crab legs they were so good. The crab was so succulent and meaty. The service was great in the inside no wait at the bar and the server was real busy making drinks for the entire restaurant but did not slack on taking care of my party.  Always a pleasure to enjoy Lure Bistro."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out and I'm glad I did! They have a really good sushi, and it's half price on Tuesdays which makes it really worth it! Haven't tried any of the entrées and I probably won't, as the rest of the menu gets a little too expensive for me, but I'll definitely be back on a Tuesday for me, especially \"The Baconator\" yum!"}
{"text":"All friends,we have been loyal customers of Lure Bistro for many years. Our 1st official date was there in 2009. We often frequent the happy hour on Fridays there. Well on this past Friday we had a disgusting experience at our favorite happy hour spot. We ordered a few drinks then a few apps...upon delivery of our oysters, coconut shrimp and a new one crab canelloni my dear hubby bit into the crab canelloni only to discover a finger portion of a rubber glove rolled up inside. Yes a rubber glove finger in his crab canelloni. I am not certain, but believe there may be new management or a new manager now. The bartender was more tham apologetic, however the manager that approached us as we vacated was less than professional nor apologetic. I am asking that you all think twice before continuing to patronize this local business. We are very sad to post this, but felt it was necessary after thinking about it for two days. Thank you for reading!"}
{"text":"Lure Bistro is by far my favorite restaurant to order sushi from. I have ventured to other establishments to try their sushi only to find myself back at Lure. No place can compare. Some of my favorites on the menu would be the Philly Roll and Tuna Poke nachos. The service is usually really great and prompt and everyone is friendly too! My only suggestion would be to make a reservation if you decide to go on the weekend or if you decide to go any day of the week in the summer."}
{"text":"Have never been there before then a friend told me about their Thursday AYCE Crab leg dinner. I took my wife and invited 8 more couples to join us. The evening was overcast a bit but they were so packed we sat outside. (The weather held out just fine.) Out of the 10 people of our entire party, 8 ordered the AYCE Crab Leg dinner. I had the Grouper and 1 other got some Sushi. My dinner was awesome. Fantastically prepared bedded atop Orzo and asparagus. Delicious. My friend that had the Sushi loved it and the others that had the AYCE crab legs,....well,....I had never seen so much food. Holy hell! They kept bring out clusters of crab and my crew just kept eating them! Very good food! Getting a drink took way longer than it should but they were so busy, I completely understood. Overall, it was a great experience. One that will rival Pickle Bills anyday! Staff was courteous and they had complimentary Valet parking,...but don't be a douche. If they park your car, flip the guy a couple of bucks at least! We all were very pleased with the experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"The service was ok, but several \"mix-ups' on billing.   The mistakes were quickly glossed over  but the aura of possible hoodwink was too obvious to ignore.  Eventually the bill was corrected.  The walleye was a 5, the chicken pasta was very good, but the sushi left room for improvement.   

The ambience was worth the other shortcomings but on a less perfect evening you might not think so."}
{"text":"Great area.  Offers Comp Valet parking.  Great sushi deals on Tuesday.  Great sushi selection.  Great variety of food."}
{"text":"I never went here back in it's alleged hey day, but i think this is still one of the top draws for Lake County these days. I can't give it a five as i didn't try any fish. But the outdoor patio was spacious, non pretentious and a very summery environment to get lit on my birthday. We had some Lake Erie monster bottles, Sierra Nevada and Magic Hat on tap, margaritas on tap(say what?) and shots of Cuervo. All dispensed by friendly bar staff. It actually reminded me of the setup from the Tom Cruise classic, Cocktail. Except the indoors has a hip bar with an exotic fish tank and a super swanky dining room for romantic times.

They close early to avoid having all the dbags that ruin Willoughby every weekend swarm the place. A very adult and laid back hangout. I could barely detect any music, which was good. Nothing wrong with being able to actually talk to the people you're with."}
{"text":"So everyone understands where I am coming from the majority of my experiences with Lure were with the previous ownership which sold the restaurant sometime in Late 2008 I believe.  I went for the first time recently and was very, very disappointed.  I tried the escargot which I always love, it was served barely warm and not very tasty.  The sushi was flavorless, and the mushroom soup I tried was the consistency of a puree.  Lure used to be perhaps my favorite restaurant in Cleveland, using fresh ingredients from the West Side Market offering a fresh twist on seafood and other dishes.  Now I'm not so sure I'd even want to give the new ownership a second try."}
{"text":"Overall I would recommend Lure for their seafood NOT their sushi.

As far as Lure being a sushi bar I would say it is very sub par since they have very limited options that are all raw sushi & without cream cheese (yuck). I guess I am not a fan of americanized sushi like this place serves. 

However their Lobster Nachos app and both their Crab Stuffed Grouper & Maine Diver Scallops entrees are VERY good!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times because I'm from the area so I wanted to support a local business but each time it gets worse! I am not sure why they are known for their sushi, it's horrible! The rice was so mushy. The rolls we ordered were all very bland. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is for the ahi tuna nachos. This is NOT authentic sushi, it's definitely Asian fusion. If you want good authentic sushi, you're better off going to Pacific East or Ginko."}
{"text":"As a WestSider who traveled over to the dark.. er.. East side to meet up with some friends, I was hoping for a bit more. 
We came on a Tuesday which happened to be the 1/2 off sushi night. I was pretty stoked because all the rolls were included in the special, not only the boring ones. 
Our friend, who suggested the place, ordered the chicken potstickers. She doesn't like seafood, but she suggested the place... hmm..

That aside, my husband and I shared a large plate of a few different sushi rolls. Unfortunately, as beautiful as they were when they came out, I really cannot say much about their taste. They were just OK. If I would have payed full prices for those rolls (not cheap!) I would have been pretty disappointed. 

I ordered some habanero drink. I was hoping for a spicy drink with some sweet to break the flavor, however, all I got was super spicy. (and I like spicy things, so it wasn't just be being a whimp!)

We did get to sit outside though, and they have a great patio. The atmosphere and the service were pretty good. I'd maybe like to come back again to this place and try some non-sushi since our friend recommended it based on the non-sushi menu items."}
{"text":"I'm SUPER disappointed with my visit from the evening of Friday, August 7, 2015. What USED to be my favorite restaurant has gone down-hill in food quality to the point where I don't ever want to go back. For 8 years, whenever someone asks me what my favorite restaurant was, it was always Lure Bistro! Looking forward to going back for dinner on Friday night I was excited to tell my friend how much he would enjoy it. However, for everything we ordered, all we could talk about was how disappointed we were at the lack of flavor and culinary execution. The calamari had WAY too much oil! The breading literally dripped off of the overcooked meat because it was SATURATED in oil. As mentioned, the meat was overcooked, reminding us of chewing on hard rubber bands. On top of that the flavor left a LOT to be desired. There was a slight hint of...peppers and bacon? Hard to tell because it was barely a hint and we ended up having to salt the pieces to attempt to get them down. It was, literally, the WORST calamari I've EVER had. For the record, we order calamari at every restaurant we eat that offers it, and this is by far the worst we've ever had. The spicy tuna roll was TINY, at best, and not nearly displaying the fullness of the pieces I've ordered previously at Lure Bistro (that's my go-to and I order it every time regardless of what else I get there) .The pieces were not only tiny, but inconsistent and sloppily prepared, and lacked...love? The oysters tasted like they were fresh water...completely void of flavor. Even by drenching them in lemon juice, horse radish, and the super bland cocktail sauce did not help. By the way, was that cocktail sauce even 'spiced-up' what-so-ever? It tasted like it came straight from the store and I guarantee you the label probably said \"plain & unflavored\".  The ribs were good, but too dry, but at least the meat fell off the bone and was cooked well. The fries were globs of greasy potato that could not even be improved adding a full layer of visible salt on each. 

The last thing that annoyed me was getting the \"hold-on-a-second\" finger from the bartender when we called over to him for something. A polite \"one moment\" would have been better...not the finger you give someone who is your employee or child. It's rude when you do that to customers at your restaurant. But that was the least of my concerns. 

I'm SO disappointed because I used to LOVE this place! The only reason this got 2 stars is because I have memories of when it was once actually good! If this was my first time there it would have definitely only received one.

What happened, Lure Bistro? Change of management? New cooks? For the record, it's been a little less than a year since I was there last, and it was still good at that time. Maybe a different cook that night?

I'm so disappointed that I will not be able to brag about this place like I used to. I hope that management reads this and somehow promotes that changes have been made and I will possibly attempt to try it again in the future, but if not, then I'll just assume that lovely nights at Lure Bistro are a thing of the past.

Hopefully this was a fluke and if you go you don't have the same experience with the dreadful quality of food that I did Friday night."}
