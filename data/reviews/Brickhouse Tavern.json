{"text":"This place used to be the best food for the money, now its just another expensive place with good food.

They just recently bump their prices (some things doubled in price) i used to go to this place often for lunch but i'm never going back. I used to get their gluten free for $14 which was kind of pricey this last time i went i paid $21 for the same thing. 

If i'm going to pay this much for a meal i'd rather go somewhere else. 
They just lost a regular client."}
{"text":"Brickhouse used to be my favorite restaurant in Davidson. I recently came in from out of town (on my birthday) to get my favorite dish, cajun chicken pasta, and because I came at lunch they refused to make it, being that it was not on the lunch menu. This had never been an issue before-very disappointed in this change because it's still on the dinner menu so I know they have the ingredients."}
{"text":"Wow!  Hidden gem. 

Impressive beer selection and pricing to suit. Most pints were about $4; didn't see the premium gouge on great local stuff and craft brews from around the country. 

Nicely done filet. Temperature correct. Sides of sweet potato waffle fries and baked Mac and cheese were tasty and well presented. 

Service was just a little shaky. A friend asked twice for a water which never did come. Water seems kind of like waitstaff 101 I'd think. Hostess was pleasant and attractive.  Bar staff seemed quite busy. 

Walked out for $32 including gratuity for a fine meal and a few great beers. 

Weds night visit around 7:30 pm."}
{"text":"There is no better casual dining in Lake Norman than the Brickhouse Tavern.

The burgers, pizzas, and appetizers all are excellent.  The chicken quesadillas are the best I ever have had anywhere.  They have a good beer selection and a good wine selection.  The bar makes excellent mixed drinks.  We have been there many many times and have never had bad service.  The structure itself provides the atmosphere casual dining chains knock themselves out to create.

During the school year it usually is hard to get in for dinner, even on weeknights.  Yes, it is the only such place in Davidson itself, but there are similar places within 2-5 miles north and south, but they really cannot compete with Brickhouse Tavern."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've eaten at Brick House while on travel for work and it's one of my favorite places I've eaten while working. The have delicious food and $2 beer that is very good for the low price. I would definitely suggest it if in town."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Mecklenburg County. Awesome atmosphere, very friendly staff. Food and beer selection is pretty large. Took my girlfriend there for New Years Eve without a reservation and only had to wait for 15-20 minutes. I was pleasantly surprised that on such a busy night they were doing a special on all draft beers for $2.50. I had a Bell's Two Hearted Ale, which at most restaurants would be $4-5. 

We were seated in one of the back dining areas and were greeted by a very friendly waiter (can't remember his name), and decided on the spinach artichoke dip to start. What a good decision that was, the house made pita chips it came with were awesome and the dip itself was hot and delicious. 

For entrees I ordered the tenderloin pasta, and my gf who is a vegetarian ordered the vegetable risotto. To keep it simple, these were both amazing, and the portion sizes are ridiculous for the price. Pasta dishes will run about $13, and these were better than dishes I've payed $25 for at other restaurants. Plus we both had at least one meal a piece in leftovers. 

If you are near northern Mecklenburg county you MUST try the Brickhouse. Just be prepared to wait or make a reservation. And be mindful of the Davidson Basketball schedule as it gets packed when the Wildcats are playing"}
{"text":"Always good food at a reasonable price. Love the Greek salad with chicken and the rib eye. The risotto has too many onions for my taste. The chocolate cake has really great fudge frosting!"}
{"text":"Solid pizzas. My favorite is their four cheese with pesto- absolutely delicious. It's common for 21+ students to visit the bar on Thursday nights."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The food is great and I like their drinks. It'd be 5 stars if they added menu variety and removed the flies from the taps"}
{"text":"Great beer selection.  Delicious pizza.  Excellent service.  You can't ask for much more in a local hangout."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Large selection of beer - tap beer too.  Great burgers and salads."}
{"text":"First visit to the Tavern and it was great. My wife and I each had an NC brewed beer (Highland Oatmeal Porter and Wicked Weed IPA). Had a mushroom sauté pizza with bacon and cheese, was excellent. Great place and hope to come back for more beer and pizza!"}
{"text":"Great space and a very nicely laid out restaurant....but this place suffers from one major theme--Quantity over Quality.  Portions are enormous but taste like microwave food.  This is a place to take a client or date  out for a drink, but not a meal."}
{"text":"I should have trusted my instinct to leave when we stood waiting to be seated for over 5 minutes. There was not a hostess in sight. At least four servers saw us waiting (walked right by us) and not one acknowledged our presence. My date walked over to the bar and asked if anyone was available to seat us and the bartender actually left the bar to seat us.

The server was prompt taking our orders. The martinis were delicious. I wish I could say the food was as well. 

The pretzel appetizer was two giant pretzels (the same type you would find at an amusement park) crusted with salt. They were SO salty we actually tried scraping the salt off with our knives.     

I ordered the \"wood fired\" pepperoni pizza. The portion was large, unfortunately it was so greasy the crust ended up being soggy. 

My date ordered the pork chop, baked macaroni and cheese, and red smashed potatoes. The pork chop was burnt on the outside, pink on the inside, and dry. The mac n cheese was noodles covered with melted cheese. No creaminess. The potatoes tasted processed.

Bottom line the food was subpar and we will not return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here a few weekends after we moved to the area (Cornelius) and didn't really know what to expect. We walked in and were told it was a 45 minute wait (which seemed pretty normal given it was about 7 pm on a Saturday night). We only waited about a half hour and were seated in the dining area. The food was really good and it had a nice atmosphere! We'll definitely be back and will probably make a reservation next time to keep from having to wait."}
{"text":"Good food. Great selection of beer. The music was a little too loud, but it made for a great Friday night out. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I can't comment on much from this place. I've only ate here twice. The first time I got a side of sweet potatoes and some chicken and dumpling soup. I loved the sweet potatoes. 

The next time we came here, I just got the sweet potatoes. They're only like 2 bucks, so very affordable. The first time I got them, they were much crispier - which I love. However, the second time we came, it was so busy, we had to sit outside...so that could be why my potatoes weren't crispy...the food took longer to get to us, plus it's really dark outside, and for some reason we didn't get the complimentary rolls - which I have to say isn't a big deal, but this particular time we were all starving, so those rolls would have been nice to have. Again, I guess it must have been because we were dinning outside? Maybe it's better to dine in???

My son got the same thing from the first time as the second visit, and, it's unanimous, the second time around the food wasn't that good. He got some sort of cajun seafood thing. The portion is huge, which we love! But the second time, he said the seafood seemed undercooked and overall it was more spicier than he remembered from the first visit.

My other son didn't even get his ice cream which is included in the kids meal during our second visit - but by that time, we were over the lack luster food and service that we didn't bother asking about it or complaining for the fact that they didn't remember the ice cream and just left...

So, if I could give you Yelpers a helpful tip for this place, maybe try eating inside and not out. Outside isn't bad, mind you...on a day that's not hot or cold, it would be great to be out there - although, maybe it would be best to just have drinks, and not necessarily food outside."}
{"text":"Thought I'd take a chance on the mushroom risotto.  Learned my lesson, only order risotto from a finer restaurant.  You couldn't even tell that it was mushroom risotto.  It had so much red onion, cream and cheese.  Very heavy.  My husbands buffalo chicken sandwich was just okay.  Service was mediocre at best. Won't be rushing back to this restaurant in awhile."}
{"text":"Solid consist food quality but they are always a server short.  If your not on a schedule it's great"}
{"text":"Was denied outdoor seating while one table was full. In addition asked for no onions got onions. And they don't carry or rotate seasonal beers. In 3 years have seen maybe 3 taps change. Food is solid Thursday deal for beer is unbeatable. Few things would make this the top spot in Charlotte. Jasmine is the best server!!!!  Ask for her!"}
{"text":"First time at Brickhouse last night. Food was great, service was somewhat disappointing.  This is not to suggest that we did not have everything we needed. Food was delivered promptly, beers stayed full, empty dishes did not stay at the table long. Our waitress did serve us very well in that respect, yes. What was lacking was a genuine sense of hospitality. From the moment we walked in, everyone we met had zero personality, no smiles, and we did not feel welcomed. From the hostess who sat us, to the runner who brought our food, to our waitress who was very frank... No one was nice. Like not even a little bit. I work in the industry so I gave our waitress the benefit of doubt - perhaps she was having a rough day. It was later at night on a Sunday, maybe she had just had it by then. I get it. Again, she did give us everything we needed, but she, along with everyone else we encountered, was very cold and made us feel like we were inconveniencing them by being there. 

Give it a shot, the menu is awesome with great prices, and we enjoyed our food and beer selections. My only suggestion to the restaurant is that they work on their hospitality."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing!  I have been here close to 10 times now. I wish I could give it more stars. To start they always have the house made brickhouse lite and brickhouse red beers for $2, plus other good specials. The lite is like a Miller lite and the red is similar to a yuengling.

The spicy chicken pasta is amazing, one of the best Italian dishes I have ever had!  The sauce they use is fabulous and it is what makes this dish stand out. I could eat it a couple times a week and not get sick of it. I have also had the pizza before and that is excellent as well! 

If you are looking for a place with a nice atmosphere, great prices, friendly people, and amazing food this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Very nice place!  Its in a college town by davidson college.. my husband and shared a greek salad and and brick house loaded pizza! Excellent and very tasty! ! Just enough for the two us. For those who like beer 2 pages of chioces and wine list!  I had the signature maruqurita very good.  Good chioces on the menu too.. salads bar food and 10 pasta dishes.. I would go again. ."}
{"text":"Brickhouse Tavern is a staple of the Davidson Community, and they are that way for a reason.  Many bars/restaurants come and go in Davidson, but the Brickhouse Tavern is where all the locals know to go for good food, good service, and great prices.  They have something for everyone from bar food to semi-fine dining, you'll find people from students to professors to locals hanging out at the brickhouse tavern."}
{"text":"Best pizza in all of Lake Norman area. Great service, even when they are slammed! Regular menu is awesome, as well. Charming atmosphere in an old Mill."}
{"text":"Gross!  Everything we had was mediocre at best.  Soft Pretzels were dry and flavorless with nacho cheese that may have once been powdered.  The tuna appetizer tasted fishy, and sushi-grade fish should not taste fishy.  The risotto was overlooked and mushy.  The service was really bad."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, reasonable price. Great addition to davidson ."}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Saturday night so we didn't mind the 30 minute wait for a table for two. When we were seated,  we got a dimly lit booth right next to a rowdy table of 10. Kind of hard to enjoy yourself sitting next to a party of loud drunks.  But I won't fault them for that. What I really wanted to mention was the quality of the food. Although the place was extremely busy, food didn't take too long to come out. We ordered the mussels and seared tuna for appetizers.  Tuna was good, mussels were horrible.  They were cooked in some weird creamy sour sauce. I've just never had mussels that tasted so terrible. For dinner we ordered the lamb and ribs. For the price of the entrées I expected better.  Everything was under seasoned. Nothing we had wowed me. Service here was decent though, but also not spectacular."}
{"text":"One word to describe the waitstaff at Brickhouse: HORRIBLE!

I was visiting my family and we stopped in one night. After waiting 50 minutes for our meal we finally walked out. No apologies, no appetizers, nothing. They didn't care. 

Would never step foot in here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place when we stayed overnight in Mooresville on the way to Florida last spring.  It sure was nicer than the chain restaurants usually found around freeway exits.

I had the Short Ribs topped with cabernet hoisin sauce and it blew me away it was so delicious.  This will definitely be a regular stop for us on our road trips south in the future.  I'd recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite!!! Cajun chicken pasta is the best pasta Ive ever had. Not too spicy. Great atmosphere. I take all my visitors here to eat. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, service is very attentive, and customization is welcomed. Would recommend to any food buff!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go with friends.  Great atmosphere (bar/taproom type) for a good time.  The bar area has a certain character which would be reminiscent of something in Boston.  The beer list is expansive and the pizza is to die for!  I would suggest the onion straws for an appetizer!  You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"This place has it all..!!  Excellent historic atmosphere, one of the best in Charlotte...  For all of you Beer Enthusiasts you have 50 different beers on Tap...  Staff is friendly and there is a great local crowd..."}
{"text":"I've only been for drinks and hanging out in the bar. Service at the bar was good, despite it being packed with fans watching the NBA Finals. Beer specials were better than expected. One quirk as a heads-up - the hostess told us that the booths in the bar required being put on the waiting list, but the high tops were first-come, first-serve."}
{"text":"Beer selection is great and has a great bar area.  As a restaurant it is good, but not great.  Food is ok and a little overpriced.  In a pinch will suffice for a date night."}
{"text":"Disappointing, ordered appetizer Nachos last night and it tasted like it was
sitting for 2 hours before we got it. It most likely was an order for someone else and they left. This chips were soggy underneath, cheese was stretchy, as if reheated in microwave and finally had to eat with a fork. We think servers reheated in microwave before serving to us.
Pretty weird, have eaten here before but seems like it's going downhill a bit."}
{"text":"I always bring my family and friends that come out of town. They absolutely love the food and the great service we receive. They have a little bit of everything. Everyone always leaves happy."}
{"text":"Ok. I hate giving bad reviews but this one has to be written. It is 700pm right now on a Sunday. We got here at 545. 10 adults and 2 kids. 
There have been people that have come ordered and left since we got here. We so far have had appetizers and most drinks have gone un-refilled
Well food came out at 703pm. They missed one of our dinners and it came out at 720pm
The waitress had to deliver all the meals herself with no runners or help which I think is ridiculous. 
Food was OK. Nothing exciting to write about. 
Needless to say we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Service was good all around and the food was superb, huge portions. Fantastic beer selection too! Server also provided us with great information on how to get closer to Lake Norman (Jetton Park). Food was among the least expensive I have seen on a menu in all of my travels."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  My husband and I quite often choose The Brickhouse as our go to place for food.  There are so many choices on the menu.  The portions are very generous for the price!  Because my husband and I can't ever decide on just two or even three dinners, we usually order four or five and take the left overs home to eat on throughout the week. Just to name a few of our FAVORITES I suggest you try: Cajun chicken pasta (so flavorful and the portion lasts me and my husband 3 meals, sharing it!!) Chicken Florentine pizza (simply unique and delicious) Shrimp Cocktail (best cocktail sauce I've ever had!!!), fried Ravioli (enough said, with homemade marinara- cant beat it), chicken Quesadillas with the homemade salsa, fabulous, and the calamari!  The Brickhouse is definitely a favorite!  Doesn't hurt the staff is amazing too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Waited 45 min. Server never showed up. Asked three times to order. Still nobody. Not even busy. Just aweful experience."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good (and plentiful) food.  Decent wine list.  Service was good, but not great (salad and bread arrived with meal, after a reminder)."}
{"text":"Giant, and I mean giant portions.  I would have not ordered the fries if I hadn't been starving.  The burger was good but not hot, more like room temperature.  Maybe it was the slaw and the cold chili?  The restaurant is beautiful, lots of interesting decor with high ceilings.  Staff was efficient and very friendly.  Good value for the location...right across from Davidson college admissions building."}
{"text":"Ok, somebody help me out here. This place gets good reviews and yet, after our one and only visit I cannot see how. 

We went here for Father's day and the food was God-awful. My husband and I split a salad -- absolutely swimming in dressing, yuck. I  had meatloaf (which was SWEET - not in a complimentary way, sweet like candy. WTH?!) my husband had a steak and a few bites into it we just threw in the towel, completely defeated by this dreadful meal. 

The service was barely adequate and the waitress was completely of the attitude of doing the least possible during her shift. You have got to be kidding if you think we would repeat our experience of this place. Next!"}
{"text":"I have probably been to Brick House fifty times over the years. I'm surprised I've never reviewed it. Their food is consistently good but the service is very very spotty. 

They have a great lunch special that is a small pizza and soup or salad for eight bucks. Can't do much better than that. 

Their pizza is great and burgers are solid. My favorite pizza is the Mediterranean pizza and burger is the blue ridge. Get their burgers in a pita, it's really good. Although it is listed as an appetizer, their chicken and bacon quesadillas make a great meal. Probably my favorite thing at Brick House. 

Brick House's food has never disappointed and it is by far the best food in Davidson. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"We have been to Brickhouse on more than one occasion, but most recently, we stopped on for lunch on President's Day. I can not say enough about the food! From burgers to pizza, to nachos, to salmon: it is all delicious and perfectly prepared. There were three of us for lunch. I had the Olympus Burger, my fiancée ordered the Salmon entrée, and our friend got the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.

The Olympus Burger was cooked perfectly (medium rare) with plenty of feta cheese. I opted to get the Macaroni and Cheese as my side. This may have been my best decision of the day. Cheesy, creamy, and crunchy! (Crunchy because of the bread crumbs, not due to undercooked noodles) My fiancée said her Salmon was cooked and seasoned perfectly. She also enjoyed her side of asparagus. As for our friend: she said the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich was exactly what she would expect but nothing spectacular. 

Why not 5 stars? We have had problems with the service on several occasions. The couple of times we sat at the bar, the one girl seemed completely disinterested in assisting us. This last time, while the server was friendly, she took more than 10 minutes to come get our order and even longer to bring us our checks. But, at least she was friendly.

And one last thing! They brew 2 beers in house, a red and a pale. They are tasty and only $2 for a pint! That alone earned my 4th star!"}
{"text":"Had a great time at brick house. Our server, Alexus (with a U), was great. She was sweet and prompt. 4/5 of us liked our food. We sat outside and had great drinks. Shots and beers galore. I would totally come back to brick house.ya, go for it."}
{"text":"We decided to try Brickhouse again after at least a year of staying away due to poor experiences - mainly service issues.  Big mistake, although different issues this time.  We looked over the menu and I decided on the tempeh sandwich because it sounded interesting and isn't something you can get anywhere.  When I ordered it, the waitress looked at me with a cheerful smile but told me that they haven't had tempeh in \"a while.\"  Huh?  It's on the menu.  We ask for some more time to make another selection.  I'm a vegetarian so my choices are limited, but I settle on the black bean burger.  \"You have those right?\" I asked with a chuckle.  \"Yes ma'am\" said the waitress.  Great!  Five minutes later \"you're going to kill me but there kitchen didn't prep those today and it will be an hour.\"  Seriously?  Fed up at that point, we left, and won't be returning this time."}
{"text":"This place has to be the most bang for your buck.... every craft beer pint is about $5 or less, you can get a pint of their beer for $2.5. Weekly happy hour deals and decent food selection with plenty TVs to watch whatever lol. It's good!!!"}
{"text":"my wife and i tried it out on saturday there a good crowd in the bar but the bar is so big you would never know. the server was prompt and got us drinks right away, i am staying off beer for a bit but i looked over the beer list and it had the usual suspects that would be expect from a craft beer list. I had the steak sandwich steak was cooked well the cheese was perfectly melty and it was served on texas toast which was a nice change for me. My wife had the turkey burger which she really enjoyed she didn't end up finishing it there so we had brought it home. Overall the atmosphere was nice and i think we will definitely return if we are looking for a good place for bar food."}
{"text":"This place needs some serious help. Having been a manager at a steakhouse for 2 years and in the food service industry for 7 years, it takes a lot to get me to complain about a dining experience. This however deserves to be put on blast.

We arrived on a Saturday night (party of 4). We had about a 25 minute wait which was no problem. We were sat and ordered our meals. That's when things got out of control. The food took FOREVER to arrive, and when it finally showed up, it was not complete, accurate, or hot. My chicken dish was served lukewarm with a side of cold, hard mac and cheese that looked like it had been sitting on a counter for a solid hour. Another guest in my group was served the same cold, hard mac and cheese. Another person in my group ordered an EXTRA WELL DONE burger and the burger was served RARE. A BURGER ... RARE! The 4th guest in our group did NOT EVEN RECEIVE HIS FOOD. We flagged down our waiter and explained all of the issues. He removed the raw burger to be re-fired, and removed the two mac and cheese dishes to bring back new ones. He also promised our 4th guest that his food would be right out since it still had not arrived. 

After another 10 minutes or so, the re-cooked burger is delivered back to the table (still no sign of the 4th person's food or the new mac and cheeses) - this time the burger is only cooked to medium. How hard is it to cook something extra well done? My friend even said they could burn the burger if necessary - he really emphasized he did not want any pink in the meat. Now the burger had been returned TWICE cooked incorrectly only to be shuttled away by the server to be recooked yet again. We asked to speak to a manager. When the manager JOEY (Joseph Hawk) arrived, we explained the situation - none of us had a complete meal - 2 of us didn't have a meal at all. He assured us he would figure out the problem and return. Another 20 minutes - one of my friends and I finished our meals, still without our mac and cheese side items and no sign of the other two dishes. I do have to throw in that my chicken dish tasted horrible on top of everything else. Do not get the Chicken Breast with sun-dried tomato pesto unless you like the taste of baby barf. Anyways, we finished our meals. 

Finally the 2 mac and cheese dishes arrived but as stated, we had already finished our meals. How does it take 20 min to make mac and cheese? The third guest's meal arrived as well at this time but STILL NO SIGN OF THE BURGER for our 4th friend. No sign of the manager either. My friend told the waiter that he no longer needed the burger, to just forget it. The waiter says \"oh no oh no we will take care of it for you but I'm still going to bring the burger.\" The burger NEVER arrived. We asked to speak to the same manager that promised to take care of all the issues and had never returned, JOEY (JOSEPH HAWK). When he did return, I laid it all out on the table for him about how our meals were never completed, only 2 of us out of 4 got to eat, the 3rd meal had just arrived, the 4th never showed up at all, etc. and he just STOOD THERE with this horrible look on his face and a condescending tone, never once apologizing for the errors. I asked why he had not returned to our table and he said he was \"in the kitchen.\" Hmmm, well don't you think you should be addressing the issues you promised to address, out on the floor doing your job? He looked at me as if he was disgusted with me and barely said anything. He removed the burger from our bill because it never showed up but then he tried to charge for the dish that arrived only moments before we were getting ready to leave. I insisted that be taken off the bill. The other two meals were given 50% off, but considering they were not complete meals and they tasted like crap, they should have been totally removed as well. We paid and left without so much as an apology from the Joey the manager. We left and grabbed fast food on the way home.

I have NEVER experience such TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and POOR MANAGEMENT. Please think twice about going here. I can safely say I will never return here based on principle. I believe this establishment should be embarrassed at themselves for how the situation was handled (or not handled), and Joey needs to get out of the customer service industry if he doesn't know how to do his job."}
{"text":"Casual place, relatively noisy crowd, but it IS a tavern, after all. I got the fried flounder and it's excellent. The server is ideal, also."}
{"text":"First visit after moving to the area:

Nice draft beer selection. As a craft beer enthusiast I was impressed. The burger I ordered was good, not great. My wife ordered the chicken parm. The chicken portion was good, but the noodles were subpar. Just some buttered spaghetti noodles.

We were greeted coldly by a snobby hostess. Our waitress was helpful and friendly.
The food did not arrive quickly but didn't take too long. Update:
The atmosphere is weird. We like the bar side better. The restaurant is a mix of high end industrial and tacky fine dining. Pretending to be something it is not. 

UPDATE: +1 Star. The pizza isn't bad, the chicken parm sandwich is good as well. I order the wings now and they are great. Can't beat $2.50 for any draft on Thursdays and a dozen wings for $6.99! Only downside is they don't really rotate the beer selection, and many of the draft beers come out warmish.

UPDATE 8/7/17: This is still our go to place. Beer selection has gotten better. Some menu items have changed. Still enjoy the wings ($7.00 now) and chicken parm sandwich. Fries have recently improved. Meatloaf was fairly good, new sides include asparagus and brussels sprouts, both good. Wish they would bring back the friend ravioli though. Overall, can't really complain. Really enjoyed the Sunday they decided to have a prime rib special."}
{"text":"The Brickhouse Tavern is truly one of my favorite restaurants. Most of the time I go in and make a meal out of their appetizers alone.  The Spinach artichoke dip and hot wings are the best.  The bar area provides a warm and welcoming atmosphere and the staff always greets you with a smile.  There are multiple large screen TVs for watching your favorite sporting event and they have many different beers on tap.  My personal favorite beer is the Brickhouse light.  Have a couple of those with their giant pretzel and you're good to go.  If you're in Lake Norman/Davidson area, it is well worth your time to stop by and check this place out."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great service, had family in for the week end and we were so glad to find the Brick House Tavern for dinner. Everyone said we'll be back."}
{"text":"The Brickhouse is a great local gathering spot. They have a great patio for the warm months, and 50 beers on draft, including many from local breweries. And pints are only $4. They have a wide menu with many different options and great pizzas! I love coming here for football games, or just with a group of friends to catch up. The Mediterranean pizza is delicious, I definitely recommend it. We also tried the artichoke hummus which was pretty tasty as well. You'll get a good meal for your money here. It's a great, lowkey, casual spot in Davidson!"}
{"text":"Just our average American restaurant. Good food, but it's nothing to write home about. The generous helpings mean plenty of leftovers though, which is nice for a college student. Also very close to Davidson's campus, which is a big plus."}
{"text":"We've been eating at the brick house for years and have always enjoyed great food and service on top of great value."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go in the LKN area.   I've been here a bazillion times and have never had a bad experience.  The food is consistently delicious, they have 50 beers on tap, the bartenders pour perfect cocktails with impeccable service. God willing,  I will be back a bazillion more times!
My go to items, The Carolina Burger, Greek Salad with Salmon, Mediterranean Pizza and the LAMB...OMG the lamb! The best I've ever had anywhere.  I just wish they'd bring it back as an appetizer.  This place is a gem."}
{"text":"The Brickhouse is a local staple in my family, a place we can always rely on when we can't figure out where to go or want something that is good and quick. The service is normally always good with the exception of one bartender who gave us problems (and a dose of major attitude) at a coworkers going away party. I mentioned it to the manager and we left shortly after that."}
{"text":"Yea....people that work here not so fun or friendly, food is okay at best, and atmosphere is loud and needs a good comet cleanse. Not impressed, sorry. We asked one of the bartenders if they have music events or anything here and she looked at us and and silently shook her head. Nothing more."}
{"text":"Brickhouse is in fact \"a-ok\" with me. I've been here a few times for lunch & tried 2 different things, which were tasty.  One being the southern flounder sandwich & the other being the Brick House special pizza.

The flounder was huge! Lightly fried, which was great. The fries were cooked perfectly, too. The coleslaw was mayonnaise based (yum).  This was way too much food for lunch, as I went back to work wanting to take a nap. :D

The pizza was good, brick oven cooked...toppings plentiful & equally distributed throughout the pizza.

The wait staff is efficient & knowledgeable about the menu.

The resturaunt itself isn't very big, but they do accommodate for groups & parties.

Prime location in Davidson!"}
{"text":"I haven't adventured out to Davidson much in my 5 years in the Queen City.  I've heard a lot of great things about the area and was happy to get a tour of the town and college from an old friend.   On our tour was his old stomping grounds Brickhouse...it was late and the crowd was diminishing but we were having a great time choosing and tasting from the 50+ beers they offer.  Good beer brings me lots of cheer!  They were still serving appetizers and pizza so we ordered some food.  This is why I'm only giving Brickhouse 3 stars...the pizza wasn't not good I would have much rather put a frozen pizza in the oven at home...man I hate being disappointed by food.   I have decided that Brickhouse is an awesome place to grab some drinks with a friend or lots of friends (this place is huge and would be great for large parties) but as far as food I would most likely not eat here again.  

*major plus for the service though the bartender was great and stayed late to let us catch up"}
{"text":"Cannot say enough about our experience here tonight. Our large party was accommodated on the outside patio by Angie.   She went above and beyond to keep us hydrated and fed.   Ordered apps and meals and all came out as ordered in timely fashion. Thank you to Angie and Brickhouse for making our short stay in Davidson a memorable one."}
{"text":"Fine dining is fun, but sometimes what you need is wings and beer. And this would be the place - they do \"naked style\" which are not quite so battered and deep fried, but they will make them buffalo, or blackened, or whatever you want. They're open to midnight, and 2am on the weekends. It doesn't win this all brand-new about 10 bucks, and a nice beer selection as well.

You know you want to."}
{"text":"That \"meh, I've experienced better\" note that Yelp gives you when you select two stars could not be more true.. and the sad thing is that THIS is actually where I've experienced better.

I don't know what's happened to this place, but each time I eat here it's less and less satisfying to me. I don't know if they're trying to keep up with Kindred or compete or be like them or what - but that's the feeling I get and it's really disappointing. We used to love eating here.

Prices seem to be getting higher and portions smaller. Menu items getting more froo-frooey (not a word - get over it) which is why I make the Kindred comment. Short ribs were super dry. Two tiny crab cakes (can you even call that a cake?) for like $19. Service was rushed and any time he'd ask, \"you guys need anything?\" he was already turning his back to us to walk away. He was also training a new server so that's comforting (sarcasm). 

Sorry to rip on your Brickhouse - but it sucks losing a favorite restaurant to whatever you've done to yourselves."}
{"text":"We have been eating at the Brickhouse for 11 years. We went twice in the past two days. The food at lunch in Monday was substandard. My buffalo shrimp was good, but on a plate with blue cheese dressing and not at all appetizing to look at and my husband's chicken quesadilla tasted like fish and had to be returned. The next night after the game, he ordered a well done burger that came out raw and also had to be returned, my nephew ordered a pizza with no oregano that came out covered with oregano and I ordered an arugula salad that was okay and didn't look very appetizing. It was not busy at either time.  The service was great, but the  food was not. Get it together kitchen. We love the Brickhouse, but I've sent friends who say they'll never go back. So sad."}
{"text":"The building is cool. The bar area is much cooler than the restaurant side. I went today for lunch and the host that sat us shouldn't be working in that position. He had zero personality and I watched him seat several tables, he dropped menus off at tables and left. Nothing was said to the people like your server will be with your shortly or enjoy your meal, something. He came off cold. 

Our server was nice but let all of our waters run dry for a long time. I had to stop eating the jalapeño dip because my moth was on fire. Once the rest of the food arrived she kept our waters full. 

I ordered a 12\" pizza with pepperoni and had them add sausage. When my pizza came out it didn't have any pepperonis on it. She took it back and about 5 minutes later she brought back my pizza with a few tiny pepperonis on it. Some slices didn't even have pepperoni on it. I asked if this was normal and she said yes. It was basically a cheese pizza if it wasn't for the sausage I asked for.  The pizza was good just week on toppings. 

Overall it was good, price was good, atmosphere was alright."}
{"text":"For me, the aesthetic of a restaurant is always one of the most important things, and that's probably why I was so fond of my experience at Brickhouse Tavern. After making a long car trip and stopping in Davidson, North Carolina, to stay at a hotel along the way, I was amazed by the scenic atmosphere of the nearby Davidson College. We had already scouted out some good restaurants in the area, and we decided to dine at Brickhouse Tavern. I didn't even have to get out of the car to know that I was in for a wonderful meal. Brickhouse Tavern is right across the street from Davidson College, and, as its name suggests, is in a building made of red brick. Just outside of this building are railroad tracks, gentrified houses, and large trees. All of this created a cozy, picturesque atmosphere. As I walked in, the smell of smokey pizza came up my nose and really aroused a rustic type of feeling. The interior was just as cute as the exterior, with dark wood and red brick being intertwined with subtle urban finishing touches to create a very chic decorum. The menu was six pages and very extensive, with a wide variety of appetizers (which also seemed like they would make great meals if desired), pastas, tacos, sandwiches, and salads. The wide variety made my table take forever to decide what to get, but our wonderful waitress was very patient and helpful. I ordered the Chicken Adobo tacos with Cast Iron Mac and Cheese as a side. I also tried breaded wings and pretzel bites as an appetizer, and both were very delicious. My meal was also tasty. The mac and cheese had a nice, crispy crust on top and was very cheesy in the middle. I can't quite describe the flavor of the tacos, but they were very good and blended the ingredients together very nicely. The portions were very large. I finished all of my food, but many people at my table did not, so I also got to try the Brick Oven Quesadilla. It was very unique, as instead of using traditional tortillas it used pizza dough and was greasy just like pizza is. The ingredients were cheese, bacon, and chicken, and they were served with sour cream and pico de gallo on the side. I would say that it tasted more like pizza than quesadillas, but personally I was fine with it because I'm a very big pizza fan. The prices were around $15 for some of the meals like the pastas and pizzas, but the sandwiches and tacos and appetizers were around $9 or even less for the appetizers, so you can eat for a moderate price if you can resist the temptation to order some of the fancier and unique stuff. Everybody in my party left feeling very stuffed (yet we still had two large boxes and one small box of leftovers), so afterward we decided to walk around the campus of Davidson College to check out the beautiful scenery and burn off some of the extra weight. I would definitely recommend doing this if you have the time. I previously have lived in the town of Athens, Georgia, and until now I have regarded it was being the cutest town I have ever been in, but after seeing Davidson, North Carolina, I would have to say that Athens has been knocked down to number two, and Brickhouse Tavern is a great contributor to Davidson's number one position on my mental list of cute towns."}
{"text":"Really wish we would not have stopped here. It ruined the rest of our vacation for us as we compared everything to the amazing food we had here.
I am not a salad person but the Caesar Salad...WOW. I never loved a salad more. I had the custom pizza and it was amazing. Sampled the macaroni and cheese and was jealous i did not order any.

It's a little off the main drag in Davidson but a must...I may just plan future roadtrips to pass through to visit again!!!!"}
{"text":"Brickhouse is a solid choice to please all taste.  We like to sit in the bar area and watch sports but the dining room has a much different vibe more suited to families. The menu is pretty diverse with everything from steak to wood fired pizzas.  Never had a bad meal here and its relatively easy to get in and out of with a huge parking lot and just far enough away from the hustle of Main Street Davidson.  Great selection of draft beers and for healthy pours on the wines by the glass.  

The pizza was terrific with healthy portion of toppings all made right up front in the brick oven and available in small or large sizes. The half roasted chicken with 2 sides for $15 is enough for 2 to share and was delicious.

Food: 3.75 Sporks
Service:  4 Sporks

Local Beer: 4 Sporks
Value: 4 Sporks"}
{"text":"I really want to like Brickhouse! I just never love the food. I'm a pretty healthy person so I think I'm just super picky. I would love it if they could amp up the healthy options a little more. Offer wraps and sandwiches available on wheat bread for lunch? The bar area is great, but I'm never blown away by the food. This is a Davidson staple though so I'll keep going there."}
{"text":"Terrible food and terrible staff! Will never go back to this place! I have had better service at a Waffle House then I did at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Brought my parents here for dinner a few weeks ago, we all had a great time and enjoyed the large beer selection and the prompt and friendly service. I split the margherita pizza and it was very good - the crust is to die for!"}
{"text":"Never made it to the meal. Hostess with a really bad attitude. Threw our menus on the table. We left."}
{"text":"Best chicken quesadilla ever and the pizza is phenomenal. Homemade pizza dough. Good drinks also. Great local place."}
{"text":"First time diners here. Loved the restaurant. Very cool atmospheres in both halves of the place. The food was great (I had the calamari appetizer and the salmon for dinner with asparagus, zucchini and squash). My bf had the mussel appetizer and lasagna (which was huge!). Mussels took forever, but probably had the most flavour out of all the dishes i tried. Overall good experience... next time we will show up earlier to avoid the wait!"}
{"text":"First ones in to dine on a snowy Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant is in an old cotton mill which makes for a unique experience.  Brick pizza ovens at the front entrance are neat to watch while waiting on a table.  I love that they have family style dining in one half and the rowdy bar scene (although unique) completely separate.  My husband ordered the blackened cod sandwich and I had fish tacos with grilled vegetables.  All of the food was superb and we will definitely be back!  The service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Brickhouse Tavern is in a 100+ year old textile mill building that has been remodeled into offices and a restaurant.  The old building makes for a great restaurant setting with the old brick walls, heart pine floors, and exposed beams giving the place a lot of character.  I have been going here for years and the food is great; the chicken quesadilla is awesome (the bacon bits make it terrific).  Pizza is a little greasy but good. 

If you go to Brickhouse Tavern sit in the bar area; I'd rate that at least four stars for great food and atmosphere.  Lots of beers on tap, great setting, good place for a date night.

However, the dining area is a different story: on my last two visits it has smelled like the ventilation system over the deep fryer is not working; the place smelled like an old diner, and my clothes and I had that smell hanging on us when we left.  It is also loud (both crowd and kitchen noise).  If you sit in the dining area you will have a one or two star experience due to the noise and smell."}
{"text":"I would have given this place more stars... maybe 3 months ago, but they have really been disappointing lately. Today was the third time in 2 months that they told me they couldn't seat us for at least 90 mins. Today it was two actually 2 hours. Sure, it's Friday lunch time. I get it. But cut the snarky attitude. Why would I make a reservation there after that? And while I don't expect the hostess to predict what we are going to order, they missed out on 6 of us ordering Friday beers down the street. They were certainly appreciative. 
When pressed on why they couldn't seat us? I was hoping it wasn't because they were discriminatory for some reason, but the excuse was around sending a server home early because they thought it was going to rain. Ummmm, there wasn't one forecast in any of the local publications that indicated ANY percentage of precipitation. My advice is if you get any attitude from the hostess, turn around and leave."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, friendly staff. Very good to unwind on a Friday evening after a long week.  Lots of beers on tap and there is something for everyone on the menu."}
{"text":"Four of us stopped in for an early dinner and were seated immediately on the patio. Nice decor but the acoustics inside were bad. Our server was great! The warm bread was delicious. My husband and I shared a Romain Wedge salad which had bacon, and cheddar cheese with red onion and tomato on the side. Not the classic flavor profile I expected. Their blue cheese dressing was great! I missed the fresh cracked pepper. The other couple each had a fresh green salad with the blue cheese dressing which they liked as well. We shared a BBQ Chicken pizza and the Brickyard Combination. We both asked for a thin crust. None of us liked the crust. Edges were tough and the sauce and toppings did not extend any where near the edge. Toppings were on the light side as well. Good cold beer! I would try them again but stick with wings or a burger."}
{"text":"I have one thing to say about the Brickhouse...well, maybe three things to say: wings, wings on pizza, and chicken quesadillas.

Two of my favorite things, wings and pizza, are combined here with the Buffalo Chicken pizza. Dip a slice in ranch, and I can feel my arteries restricting, but it tastes so good.

If you're not in the mood for greasy wing sauce, the chicken quesadillas and ultimate nachos also hit the spot.

Food is only part of the experience, however. The spacious bar area is a great place to watch games, with a big-screen tv and many smaller tvs all located above the bar area.

Live music  throughout the week and numerous beers on tap (the pumpkin ale they serve in the fall is like gingerbread in a glass) keep this place high on my list of fun places to go.

Not to mention its less than a mile from the Davidson College campus, so its usually packed. 

Good times."}
{"text":"A Little Hit of Miss on Sunday Lunch.

Been awhile since we have been to Brickhouse Tavern but decided to give it another try. Based on prior experiences, it can be very good or somewhat lacking.

Today was lacking at least on Food consistency.

Walked in a little after 12 and my  wife, the football nut, asked to be seated in the bar so she could see the big screen TV's. Promptly seated and service was excellent throughout.

Ambiance is nice and very attractive, particularly in the bar area with dark wood and creatvie lighting.

Problem was with the food.  I ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with garlicky smashed potatoes as my side My wife ordered a Crab Cake Appetizer with Grilled Asparagus as a side.

First of all, the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. It was suppose to come with Bleu Cheese Crumbles which it did but rather than evenly distributed over the sandwich, were all concentrated in one spot. When you bit into that one space, the bleu cheese was all you could taste. Dissected the sandwich and you could see all of the cheese was only in one spot Rest of the Chicken was rather bland and all you could taste was the Buffalo Sauce.  The Smashed Potatoes would have been OK except they were cold.

On a positive note, my wife did enjoy her Crab Cake Appetizer. She gave me a bite and it was very good.  On the other hand, the Asparagus was way too big and was already woody. She was only able to eat the very tip.  Diameter of most of the stalks were greater than my thumb and I have fat hands.

A little more attention to the cuisine, this could be a great restaurant but for now, still hit or miss."}
{"text":"I love this place because they seem to be able to be all things to all people which is nearly impossible to accomplish.  They have a separate bar.  They have wonderful pizzas, hand crafted and baked in their very own brick pizza oven.  Then there is the dining room  where young and old alike can enjoy a nice meal. Nothing gourmet.  Decent food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. Jasmine Faye was the best waitress we've had in a long time!!!! The food is consistently great, and we love the options of seating patio, tavern or restaurant."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 2018: 39/100

A coworker and I decided to go for some American comfort food, and I was low-key feeling dreadful because I wasn't planning on having a full-on sit-down meal and eating something rather heavy. To my surprise, I found my experience at Brickhouse Tavern really enjoyable!

There are plenty of seating inside the restaurant, and the service was really quick. We came on a Monday and I found out that they have a 1/2 price all wine (below $40) deal!! I definitely could not pass on that, and ordered their Moscato. The bottle of wine itself cost $30, meaning that it only cost us $15 for a whole bottle of wine (and split that between the two of us - $7.50!) 

Besides the wine, I also thought that the pasta was really worth it. I ordered the Chicken & Wild Mushroom Risotto ($14), and was expecting a small-ish plate since most places don't serve a lot for pasta/Italian dishes. When the waitress brought out the food, I was surprised at how much food there was, and I could barely finish half! For the price, I thought their other pasta options were worth trying too (ex. Seafood Pasta for $17). 

I'm not sure if I'm holding this restaurant to the pricing standard to those in California/Los Angeles (but Lake Norman/Davidson isn't exactly a cheap place either). But the price and quality of food definitely sold me. After finding this place, I am excited to come back to Mooresville for more work visits so I can come back for the 1/2 price wine and more reasonably priced food! :)"}
{"text":"Decent casual atmosphere with some interesting art on the walls.  Dining Room was a little warm and there was a occilating fan in the corner to help I suppose, but it was 95 degrees outside so I can understand if the AC was trying to keep up. We ordered the calamari as as an appetizer and I was unimpressed. While the portion size was enough for 4 people, it had really no flavor at all until you dipped into the marinara sauce which was okay. My husband was thrilled with the selection of beers. We both ordered a cesear salad which was quite tasty and we split a mediteranean brick oven pizza. It was very tasty and it was plenty for two people to share. The other couple with us had the lasagna and the cajun chicken pasta. They both seemed happy with their meals and their portions were huge too! We all took take home boxes. 
I would go back here!"}
{"text":"If you don't mind going a little out of your way to Huntersville, check out Killingtons instead. Better service, food, and atmosphere. 

Brickhouse is simply okay. Their food is all right, but not anywhere near worth the price. The same goes for the portions. Not going for gluttonous, but I'm left feeling unimpressed. Beer list is pretty cool, but again, the frustration just looms after you wait 20 minutes just to get some bread on the table. I'm generally a patient person, but all around I'm left feeling the food and experience could have been better. 

Busy night? Darwin. Evolve. Adapt to your crowd. 

Lastly, parking is all right, but in the end, don't bother. Killingtons will be a better experience for you."}
{"text":"Brickhouse has a GREAT interior.  The atmosphere is warm and hip. Wonderful place to hit for a couple casual after work drinks. 

Service is ok as is the food.  If you need something relatively quick and moderately priced:
Ribs, chicken wings, House pizza, and greek salads are all good choices."}
{"text":"Their food beer selections is good however the only problem here is wait times. Desk said 30 minutes and we have been waiting for 60 minutes. not cool and this is why we don't come here anymore."}
{"text":"Terrible bartenders. They take forever to serve a drink, have a snarky attitude, and are rude to patrons. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We came here with friends for dinner and drinks. We had a great time, seated in the bar where a lot was going on. I enjoyed the crab cakes appetizer ($10) with the Texas sauce (normally served with friend onions) instead of the thousand island remoulade. The crab cakes were tasty and the Texas sauce was a nice, spicy addition. I ordered a side of sweet potato fries which were waffle-style. They were crispy and delicious! 

My husband ordered the sunny side up burger with tots and enjoyed them. Our friends ordered the salmon BLT and another burger which bother reported as delicious as well. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved to Davidson.  We love this place!  Great prices and real food.  You can taste the chargrill on the fresh meat burgers and the pizza is fantastic.  For the price, we've not found a better place."}
{"text":"It is okay.   Average.    Basic bar food with some higher end items.   I got the crab cakes,which comes with two sides. I ordered Brussels sprouts and sweet potato fries.  I was served asparagus instead.  Okay, I like asparagus as well.  It tasted like gas, the crabs cakes were a stage and on the smaller side but the sweet potatoes were good.  Lively place to watch football.  Big place and good for large tables."}
{"text":"Winner winner chicken dinner, well it was buffalo chicken pizza, but still awesome.   This place is always packed on the weekend.  Except a minimum of 45 minute wait around dinner.  The waiting area is large and comfortable with both inside and outside seating.  While you wait, it kind of sucks, the pizza oven is right there, so you have to grin and bear the pizzas that come out like a parade of food.

I almost hijacked a server for a pizza!!!!

Also, with awesome beer specials and killer $2 draft specials, this place is family friendly that will not break the bank.    

My only bitch and why this is not 5 Star, I had the nachos.  The chili was tasty, but for some reason the cheese had zero flavor.  Maybe it was just a freak batch of cheese, dunno, but I am a cheesey nacho lover, so I take it pretty seriously.........  ciao"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, food was outstanding, the atmosphere -- old cotton mill, is very unique, the staff is so friendly!  We had a GREAT time, pizza was the best!"}
{"text":"Good portion size.  Tasty bread.  Pepperoni pizza was dry and needed more sauce.   The salad was okay."}
{"text":"There was a 45 minute wait for a table early on a Friday night.  Not unusual. The chicken aioli was tender and flavorful. Garlic mashed potatoes well seasoned but arrived at the table cool not hot. Pleasant server. Festive atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but the best part about the Brickhouse is all the beers on tap. I am not even a beer drinker, and this place impressed me.
I had a strawberry beer, sounds gross, but it was actually pretty good. 
This was the first place that I ever experience Yuegling, with an orange slice. 
Since North Carolina is a no-smoking restaurant and bar designee now, maybe I will go back with the chitlins."}
{"text":"This place is great! Really had no issues with it until today when we walked In and  At least ten people where sitting at the bar and they would not even give us last call at the bar and it was 8:45 on a Friday night. We walked off and as we where walking out after being turned off we got told \" this is to get our staff home safe\"  I told the lady it is not even snowing out anymore then, some guy walked out ten min after we walked out when we where outside leaving and yelled to us to never come back. Real professional . I don't understand why he would yell that when we where outside walking to the car to leave. We all want everyone to get home safe but that was not handled well....."}
{"text":"We have been going here for a few  years in fact use to be one of our favorite restaurants. The last couple times we have been our service has not only been horrible and slow but extremely rude! We waited forever for our food mine was cold and fries were burnt. So burnt when I went to ask for new ones she said ohhhhh those are burnt I will get you new.....they came when everyone was done eating and ready to go. We asked for check 30 minutes later we were still waiting. I then ask for manager who told me the kitchen was busy...sorry! Really? So next time should I call to make sure the kitchen isn't to busy? I mean should I be ok with bad food and bad service because the kitchen was busy??? Oh and I have been when this restaurant is packed busy and tonight wasn't one of them. Very disappointed in whole experience."}
{"text":"The chicken parm was decent but overcooked. The sweet potato fries were raw inside and not cooked enough. Pricing was fair for what you get, will try again and order the pizza next time as that seems to be their specialty. Love the decor and wait staff was very friendly and never let our drinks get empty!"}
{"text":"Wow!  My wife and I ate here for the first time today.  The meal was awesome.  BT has earned a revered place in our list of great dining spots."}
{"text":"Saturday night date  night. Sat in bar area, kids running amuck like it's McDonalds playground, no management to be seen, food was average at best and overpriced for the bland flavors. Server nice  and friendly, but also  frustrated with by kids without supervision.  Not coming back anytime soon for dinner."}
{"text":"In consistent menu you never know what the food will come out as. Too spicy over cooked bad portions what ever!!  menu never describes accurately what you get. Good service bad food experience... I live close by  I've been trying to support this place for ever. I'm all but done such a shame."}
{"text":"The wait was really long. There was some confusion about getting a seat in the bar instead of waiting for the dining room. \"Just grab a table if it comes open, but we'll put you on the waiting list.\" Anyhow, some of the food tasted like it came right off the Sysco truck...frozen not hand cut fries, canned artichokes, very greasy cheese on the pizza, super oily pizza crust, bland tomatoes, tiny crab cake. The positives...the mac and cheese was delicious, the bread served before dinner was ample, the pita bread held the black bean burger without falling apart, the rack of ribs was sizable and easy to pull apart."}
{"text":"Holy cheap drinks Batman!!!  I can only comment on the bar - not the food - but this place hit the mark!  We stopped in Saturday just to watch the game and drink at the bar.  It is a very edgy cool bar - high-tops and couches to go along with a long bar.  

The bartenders were super- attentive and I couldn't believe how reasonable the prices were for the drinks!!  Two liquor drinks and two beers - $16 bucks!!!  

There is only one mega big tv - the rest are small, so unless you are sitting in the exact right center of the bar it is rough to watch the game. 

Great mix of folks - not all young kids!  Will definitely be back if we are in the area!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a taphouse with a huge variety of beers on tap?Then  this is the place for you!  Watch out though...without a reservation on a Saturday night you are looking at an hour wait.  Then you'll be waiting a long time to get your food once ordered.  Pasta and Pizza dishes are great but the Ahi Tuna left much to be desired.  In fact I got sick during the night:(  So I won't be going back there for a while!  There are better options if you are not a beer drinker."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and all of my experiences have been ok.   This is nothing to rave about.  The place is big and you have a separate dining room and bar.   There are a lot of items on the menu, maybe too many.   The food is lackluster.  This visit I had the chicken tacos and they were ok.  

From a service point of view, it has always been ok.   This time, our service was good.  Our server was a little off, but everyone has their quirks.  

Personally I wouldn't run to come here I think that there are other places to go."}
{"text":"Locals love it, and it's nice enough to bring guests from out of town!

I work in Davidson and Brickhouse has become a staple restaurant for work functions. It's got a huge menu that will easily satisfy MANY palates. Salads, entrees, personal pizzas, group pizzas, gluten free crust, tacos, burgers, apps, dessert, drinks, you name it! I highly recommend the Greek Salad and the gluten free crust.

Service can be a little hit or miss. If you're in on a weekday for lunch they will get you in and out in under an hour, but we always seem to have less attentive service on weekends. (Slower environment, slower service?)"}
{"text":"Whoever runs Brickhouse is the luckiest son of a bitch in Davidson, because they've somehow, even with a college right next door, basically cornered the market on food and alcohol in the town after 9.  The food's okay; I'm actually most fond of their soft pretzel appetizer (not that it's an excellent soft pretzel, it's just a great idea for an appetizer, especially at a bar and grill, and I'm shocked more restaurants don't have them.)

The bar's a good bar, with some good beer available.  I've had some highly variable cocktails, though, depending on the bartender.  When they have live music it's alright, nothing great.  I really enjoyed sitting outside, and there's always the convenience of the place being within walking distance of all of downtown.

Now keep in mind that I've only been here during the summer, when it's not that crowded.  Supposedly the place is out of control packed on the weekends when school is actually in session.  If that's the case then I'd stay away if it looks crowded, or on the weekends.  But if you're in Davidson over the summer, drop by."}
{"text":"Great Beer Selection. We were there with a large group and were placed in a room a few steps up on a riser, close to the kitchen. Very warm, so we asked them a few times to see what they could do about the air. Temperature stayed about the same.

Food was average, towards the end of Aspargas season, and it was pretty tough. Artichoke dip was bland and seemed like it needed garlic and maybe salt. I do agree with a previous reviewer and think the Pretzel App. is fantastic."}
{"text":"Following a citywide power outage resulting in a piss poor I-77, all I wanted was some beloved brick house to tickle my eating fancies. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, chicken, with Brussel sprouts and sweet potato fries. Sounds pretty unscrewupable right???? WRONG. I thought it would've been an easy task to include a Texas ranch and honey yum yum mustard as my two dipping sauces in my meal but I suppose that was just too daunting of a task to complete during a pathetic Sunday night \"dinner rush\". Despite this shenanigans, I made the sophisticated decision to call and ask what had happened and why the chicken recipe had changed from what it used to be when I had it in 'Nam. Needless to say, this phonemail ended with me asking my roommate to hold my hoops for me out of anger after I overheard the brick house staff profanely complaining about my supposedly outrageous requests. NOT WORTH THE HYPE. all I gotta say. Amen and as always, roll tide."}
{"text":"Brickhouse has been doing a horrible job answering the phone for pick up orders. Any time I call I have to call over 10 times till someone answers the phone. They are not busy because I live down the road from the restaurant and can see the parking lot completely empty for the most part. I guess they enjoy losing customers."}
{"text":"First if you have a large party DONT go here!! They won't take reservations for the same day but will in advance- wtf kind of stupid policy is this??? Hostesses IQs were collectively unimpressive and the management didn't jump in to help! The one table that someone had called ahead and reserved finally got here after the table sat empty for more than an hour while others were waiting!!! Stupid management!!!

On the flip side the kitchen and our server saved the day!!! The food was top drawer and our server Holly Maxwell was extraordinary !!! I took her recommendation for the short ribs and they were amazing and manna from heaven!!! When there was a slight problem Holly took care of it quickly and efficiently!!

In short it was a bipolar dining experience but the food and service beyond the front end was amazing!!! Just fire the manager and hostesses."}
{"text":"This location has great atmosphere and the wait staff was extremely courteous. If you go for lunch I'd highly recommend a cold tap beer and the naked fried chicken wings sauced with BBQ.  They are absolutely phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Great food, lively atmosphere, good casual place to eat. Extremely busy on the weekends, and unusually long waits for tables are my only complaint."}
{"text":"Really like this place and even though I only had drinks in the bar area I wouldn't mind coming back to try out the dining side of the house.  Super cool decor, very large wood bar and adequate staff made for a very pleasant experience.  Not to mention, the drinks seemed to be amazingly affordable in relation to pricing at typical bars.

I really enjoyed the big comfy couches but keep in mind they don't have wait staff to accomodate that area so if you want a waiter/waitress you have to be either seated at a table or the bar."}
{"text":"Saturday brunch, me and my guy friend was told this was a cool spot for food and drinks. We went on a Saturday afternoon and there was no wait. The location looks like an old mill or factory close to train tracks, and lots of construction. So I anticipate this area growing a bit. We sat at the bar, asked for a menu, the bar tender gave us a beer menu. So I had to ask her again for a menu. Anywho, My friend ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and I had the turkey burger. My turkey burger was just ok. It came with cucumber sauce, which I didn't like, and the asparagus was ok. My friends chicken sandwich came with some unknown sauce so we had to return it, and he didn't care for the fries. He didn't finish is chicken sandwich, said it was dry, and lacked flavor. We ended up going to another place and ordering more food to satisfy out hunger.. I may return to check out the night scenery."}
{"text":"I give this place a liiiiiitle extra credit simply for location - I'm a sucker for Davidson. Brickhouse (she's mightay mightay, jus' lettin' it all hang out!) Is an institution, though it doesn't seem it like it's old enough to be an institution. I think the inviting environment, good service and selection of beers is what keeps people coming back b/c the food is good, but it isn't as almighty as the brickhouse being serenaded by Lionel and tne Commodors. The salads are good but I thought my burger was frozen, not hand pattied."}
{"text":"This place is awful for one reason. The service. We arrive at 10:30 pm on a Tuesday. I asked to order a drink when the waitress first arrived and she rudely told me to wait till everyone at my table puts in an order. I ignored her rude comment and went to the bar to order my beer since I was only drinking. I order my beer at the bar and the bartender assumes her tip. I was upset but didn't say anything because she took the tip I was going to give her. I return to my table to find the out that the other guests were just unjustifiably interrogated by the waitress for my actions. The waitress then took our tables order. When she arrive she spilled beer on the phone and wallet of a person in my party. Next she rudely commented about a question another person had about chicken wings. He asked about the hot sauce selection and the waitress sassed him and switched the subject to dipping sauces. She was a bitch. 

I went to use the restroom and overheard her complaining about our table to another employee. She then exclaimed how much money she made tonight. She was the most unprofessional waitress I have ever had and she should be fired. 

The only redeeming quality was the listed beer prices. The specials for Tuesday were decent. However they will jip you of money if you aren't careful. Seriously people at my table were afraid for the waitress to break their cash."}
{"text":"Usually love brick house and have been going since before the menu changed. Last time I sat in to eat I ordered the Mediterranean pork sandwich which came on a pita bread. My friend ordered it as well. It tasted delicious. Tonight I ordered it to go and when I got home saw it was served on a brioche bun instead of the pita bread as advertised. I called and told them of the mistake and they responded rudely insisting that it always comes on a brioche bun and it has to be special requested to come on a pita. I told them of my last experience and they essentially denied it happened. They weren't willing to help me or let me pick up a replacement pita and said they were busy and the most they could do was take my number and call me back. It wasn't until I told them it is advertised on the menu as being served on pita on their site that they begrudgingly let me pick up a pita. The food is great but the customer service is abysmal. Double check your take out orders before you leave."}
{"text":"I have always had a good experience at Brickhouse Tavern.  The portions are large and the service is usually good, unless they are super busy.  The building and decor is rather unique but with a rustic charm.  The food is the reason to go.  I have had salads, burgers, pizzas, and sandwiches and have never had a bad experience.  The prices are low, especially considering the portions. The bar is likely the best in Davidson.  Sundays offer specials of $5 Bloody Marys and mimosas and there are usually $2 draft beers.  Great prices and a great atmosphere for family and friends."}
{"text":"Do you pull your employees from a food service reject pool? Went here for a drink on a Saturday evening with some old friends, after having gone for drinks at this same establishment with my mother the previous evening, and was refused service because my ID was a temporary license issued by the state of Georgia while they printed up the plastic version. According to the bartender, \"this ID allows you to drive but not to be served alcohol.\" So, according to this bartender, this ID is considered my legal identification by law enforcement and state and federal government, however, to this bartender, this ID did not constiture proof of age. In addition to this temporary ID, I presented two credit cards with my name and my old student ID from the University of Georgia with my name and picture. Not to mention that this ID is accepted at my local ABC. I found nothing in North Carolina statute to substantiate this bartenders claims, which he this described as \"Food and Beverage Law.\" Anyway, when I arrived the evening before, there was no hostess at the hostess stand for a period of 5 or so minutes to great or seat my elderly mother and I. Waitress rarely performed table touches exept to deliver a single beer 15 minutes after it was ordered, saying, \"sorry... [Something mumbled under breath about bartendar]\" and doing a walk-by beer placement on the table. Oh, and of course, to deliver the check. I will not be reurning to this establishment, which is sad because it is just down the block from one of my homes. By the way, fix your beer menus (which I ordered from the night before you refused me service). You can't claim to have a craft brew \"rotation\" where \"prices vary,\" when the \"rotations\" that you offer are hard-printed on the menu with an associated, consistent price. I found the one beer on the menu that sounded appealing, and, lo-and-behold, it was out of stock. Hope this helps you improve your business!"}
{"text":"Don't get the vegetable risotto. So much butter I feel sick. And I couldn't taste the pesto which is what motivated me to try it in the first place. 

My friend ordered pizza which was good. 

The rolls look like Sister Schubert's rolls that I can get at the grocery store. Don't get me wrong, they're good, but I like it to feel special when I'm eating out. Our server was nice, and the atmosphere was great on the back patio in the shade."}
{"text":"Great menu. Killer pizzas. Really good. We have been many times over more than 5 years and it's always good. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Always n always make a reservation before you start dreaming abt the yummy cajun pasta they have to offer. Even on weekdays lunch there is a waiting line. But once in its worth all the wait!"}
{"text":"This restaurant never lets us down! The food is always so yummy! Its a great place to go for a family meal or on a date!! Atmosphere is so cool!  (hint: you MUST try the spinach artichoke dip...best ever!!)"}
{"text":"This is my second time here... I thought I would give them a second chance as last time it was just ok... this time was worse. From the table streaked with what could only have been a dirty cloth when they wiped it down, to the waiter who was sullen faced and not really interested in doing his job. I ordered a wild mushroom pizza which sounded amazing from the variety of mushrooms to the \"Parmesan curls\". It was a very poorly made pizza, the crust was burnt, there was about an inch and a half of crust before the very meager amount of alfredo sauce and cheese started. The mushrooms where all white mushrooms out of a can, and it was covered in grated Parmesan cheese which I can't stand. The arugula was a bit wilted. The waiter never once came by to ask how it was even after he came by twice to refill my water and saw I was picking the toppings slowly off... all in all a horrible second chance. Will not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a gorgeous restaurant! I had the grilled shrimp tacos and they were amazing. My date had a burger and said it was excellent as well. I had 3 pints of beer, the special. Our overall tab was only $28. Great deal for amazing food! The service was a little slow, but in their defense I think our server was new. I will def be back."}
{"text":"Stick with the pizza and salads.  Great beer selection.  Bar is large and huge beer selection. Dining room is also large with lots of seating.  You can go after work for happy hour or take the family for lunch.    I would not get the nachos again."}
{"text":"So my review will start with, its too loud in this place, not so much if you're in the bar area but the main dining area. Just as horrible is the heat! Holy cow the place is suffocating! The actual food is meh, ok. It was lunch and got to say pretty cheap. Best part was the salad. Their house dressing is good, a thick balsamic. The pizza is meh, the pepperoni honestly repulsive but my husband ate it! wings are meh, it was the hybrid buffalo bbq sauce and pasta with veggies was not bad, over cooked mushy penne, a few broccoli pieces, tons of bermuda onion and zucchini..its ok. Go to have a few drinks, dont expect to much on food."}
{"text":"Used to frequent this place 3 x a week. Prices were good, food was excellent, & staff friendly. Recent price increases are ridiculous & portion size is down. An example: Lunchtime salmon went up +50%, from $9.99 to $14.99 and portions decreased too? What is going on here Nick? Dinner prices way up too. Staff is also now below average. No longer a fan."}
{"text":"Brickhouse tavern in NOT one of those places you go to dine and run. However, if you are looking for a place with an infectious atmosphere, amazingly attentive servers, and food that is nothing short of amazing; then Brickhouse is your place.  I have been there many times and I can honestly say that after navigating the menu, I have yet to receive a dish that was not done to perfection. The pizzas are cooked just right with hand tossed dough, the Salmon is incredibly tasty, and I can assure you that the pasta dishes will leave you smiling! . All of this food is accented with a wine list that provides the perfect partner for any dish

If Food is not the main reason for going, feel assured that the restaurants bar will please both you and your pallet. The bar tenders are friendly and they know there stuff. Any cocktail you can conger up will be produced, and the huge beer selection will leave you feeling spoiled. While enjoying your beer and football on one of the many large screen televisions, make sure you take a moment to bite into the amazing chicken wings and soft pretzels they offer. Also be sure to stop in for the live music provided by local bands that cover everything from blues to classic rock. 

I will continue to head up to exit 30 in Davidson to enjoy myself in this beautiful restaurant. I will recommend that anyone looking for a good time head there as well. If you don't want to go alone, feel free to call ahead and reserve a table for your entire party. You will not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Came into Davidson dark looking for a place to have a beer. Went in and saw their menu. They brew their own. I saw a pint of Red ale for $2.50 a steal!! Very reasonably priced beer here.

Now the negative. I ordered the pretzels cheese and mustard. MYbe I expected too much but this was average at best. Frozen pretzels heated up with generic non tasty cheese and boring mustard.

Not sure I would eat agin but for 2.50 yes pour me another pint"}
{"text":"The food is almost always good (not great), but the staff is 50/50. Half the time we get a great waitress, the other half you get girls who seem bothered that they are waiting tables."}
{"text":"This is a nice place for something different (from the chain restaurants) great food and people. Pizza is amazing. Great place for a dinner party....very accommodating. The staff is attentive and always around. Never run out of drinks. Ask the waiter what they order...but you can't go wrong with anything you order !"}
{"text":"Nice interior, always a full parking lot.  They are tricky on reservations.  Had the grilled salmon, outstanding.  The grilled veggies, mushrooms and the artichoke were also very good.  Reasonable prices as well."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you are wanting above average bar food and drinks!  Excellent post work or hang out spot.  

We sampled the pretzels, wings, quasadillas, shrimp cocktail and seared tuna.  The wings were average, the pretzels were good and salty, the quasadillas were nice and full of ingredients, the shrimp cocktail was very good and the seared tuna was okay.

On our next visit, I hope to try entrees!"}
{"text":"This is our regular hangout spot at work, can't believe I still haven't reviewed this place. This place has both, and indoor and outdoor seating area, as well as a bar area. The bar area is our favorite, and the outdoor area is nice on a good day.
This place has good drink specials and a very good beer collection. Food is good too... good pizzas and the spinach and artichoke dip is to die for. That, and the calamari. And they have good desserts, so basically you are pretty much set.
The servers are great, friendly and attentive. Actually, I would like to rephrase that... SOME of the servers are great (which is why we always prefer the bar area -- the servers there are great). Nicole and Jasmine are my favorite!
Lots of TVs to watch games. The good thing about this place is they have an alcohol meter so you can make sure you are under the drivable limit of drunkenness."}
{"text":"The only reason they got 2 stars was because the server was nice and the sweet potato fries were good. Other than that it was awful. Long wait for food and it was 78 degrees in there  absolutely insane. I checked the thermostat."}
{"text":"Skip the food... stay for the bar and the crowd.."}
{"text":"This restuarant is a fantastic place to have a leisurely drink and some outstanding food.  Its become our favorite eating and dining place.  Great service, really great food, lots of TVs and a low key enjoyable atmosphere.  The owner is a real good manager and chef. Their menu has many great tasting items."}
{"text":"Server was great. Coos portion size has been reduced. Only went there for their seafood pasta. Which they didn't have. I got chicken Parmesan which tasted different than the last time I got it. Mixed drinks are very hit or miss. There beers are lukewarm. Disappointed been there several times and the quality and quantity of food used to make up for the negatives. Don't change what isn't broken."}
{"text":"I have ate here several times. After a morning meeting, I stopped in for lunch and ate in the dining room. There are two areas, dining and bar. Today I had the salmon with asparagus and coleslaw. All of it was very good. I noticed that most people were ordering a salad or the pizza and everything look great. My server was quick, friendly and accommodating for a busy lunch rush. I can tell that care and quality goes into making each dish and that is why I will be back."}
{"text":"I came to the area for a work trip a couple of weeks ago, and I chose Brickhouse Dinner because the menu appealed to me. 

I went by myself, though. It wasn't too busy. Here's why I'm mentioning it: 

I was seated when I approached the entrance, which is nice. But once I got my booth, I sat there for 10 minutes and nobody took my drink order. 

Finally, a waitress came to my table, apologizing that she didn't take my order because the girl who seated me apparently didn't tell her that I was here. But the waitress's apology didn't seem sincere, either. 

So anyway, I asked the waitress about a gluten-free option on a pasta dish I was interested in getting, so she ran back to the kitchen to ask. 

She came back a few minutes later, telling me it is gluten-free and that she already placed my order. 

Ok, great. I didn't really decide if I really wanted that dish, but thanks for ordering it for me anyway without double checking? I felt like I was rushed to get out of there. 

When she placed my dish on the table, she wasn't even friendly about it; not, \"Enjoy\" or \"Would you like more water?\" 

Just, \"Here you go.\" 

I only had one refill and that was when she took my first order. She also handed up the check pretty fast. 

I looked around to see if any of the other servers were doing their job on other tables, and it looked like a lot of hungry customers were waiting like I was. 

Anyway, I felt incredibly rushed and the food ended up being ok. There's a lot of young kids working there and I guess they were all pissed off working on a Sunday. 

Because of my experience with service, I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here last night for drinks and apps..more drinks then apps let's say :) I've been many times in the past for actual meals as well but this was my  first time after joining Yelp. Anyway for last night's experience we got the fried ravioli and chicken quesadilla which by the way are cooked in their brick oven, both were very good. We also were recommended to try the chocolate martinis by some random sweet older man walking by that stopped to talk to us so needless to say don't have to tell us twice to try a drink.  So glad we did they were amazing! 
I usually sit in the bar area when I go which is always lively,  service has always been great and food is at a great price especially with the portions they give you!  I always have leftovers! This is a must try place if you're in the Davidson area."}
{"text":"Brickhouse Tavern in Davidson is easily the most consistent place to at in the area.  If you are the type of patron that enjoys knowing exactly what you are getting yourself into, then this is the place for you.

The quesadilla is probably my absolute very thing on the menu.  It is an appetizer but I often get it as an entree or split it with my wife.  Don't think of a traditional quesadilla... This one has a pizza crust (sour dough?) tortilla, bacon, chicken, deliciousness.  Served with sour cream and pico. Literally the greatest.  Their burgers are decent and very filling.  The salmon is just fine, nothing too crazy to write home about but I have eaten it multiple times.  Though, I have always loved their fried flounder.  The pasta dishes have always been served in large portions and my wife and I would always split.

Rarely any issues with services except with the host/esses that have worked in the past.  It hasn't happened in a while but, I used to walk in and the boy/girl at the booth would just stare at you blanking.  I finally got to the point where I would walk in, look at their blank stares and I'd say \"Welcome to Brickhouse.\" Otherwise, service is typically pretty nice."}
{"text":"We enjoy the Brickhouse Tavern about every 4 weeks and find the food to be good and plentiful.  We usually enjoy the pizzas, salads and burgers.  I have noticed over the past few months some nice additions to their offerings on the side dish section of the menu....Brussels sprouts, collard greens, quiena.   Overall the Brickhouse Tavern offers a well rounded dining experience with a consistently good staff.  Last weekend our serve was Angie, who did a great job and was very friendly."}
{"text":"Charming tavern with a wonderful outdoor patio and large bar area. Lots of old brick and rustic wood in a converted old fabric mill.  I had the blackened fish tacos with perfectly crisp sweet potato fries, waffle cut. Others had fantastic huge chargrilled burgers on toasted brioche buns."}
{"text":"I am going to give Brickhouse 4 stars, although in the past I would have said 5, and in the present I would say 3.  Brickhouse used to have an AMAZING menu which all of the locals clearly loved and were fans of.  As of a few months ago there were items removed from the menu and the entire style of the menu changed.  I still enjoy brickhouse, but it does NOT have the same consistency that I used to find when we dined here. Also,  I have hosted a bridal shower here and my husband and I hosted our engagement party here- both were GREAT events!  Brickhouse did a great job of really letting the flow of the back room work for our events and provided great quotes and food for both.  That said, both events were 2 years ago + and I have a feeling their party situation/menu has also changed!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, good comfort food. 50 draft beers, what more do you want at 10pm? Not many places open this late with really good selection."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews, I guess I visited at the right time. Or the staff had a meeting about customer service. During my visit, the staff was friendly and the service was good. The restaurant was impeccably clean, and the atmosphere is casual comfort yet with class. Wanting to play it safe since this was my first visit, I went with a personal cheese pizza. It was good, not great."}
{"text":"Good pizza, good beer list, long waits during peak dinner hours. I'd give them 5 stars if I was basing this just on the food and atmosphere but, there has been a few too many times the long wait has driven me to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the food but the service is generally on the bad side. 

I've been to Brickhouse countless times since it's so convenient for me.  I keep going back because their blackened salmon Caesar salad is one of the best I've come across here at the lake.  The piece of salmon is usually generous and when it is well seasoned it is just a delicious dish.  Their lunch salads are a great deal, they have six different generously sized salads each priced at $4.99 or $5.99 (the Caesar is $4.99) and then you can add a protein if you wish (chicken $3.99, salmon/shrimp/blackened cod/steak $4.99, tuna $5.99). Which makes my delicious salmon Caesar $9.98 and I always walk away with leftovers.  They used to make their croutons in house, yummy deep-fried bad-for-you morsels of deliciousness that I would counsel myself not to eat and would finally give in and eat every last one.  Unfortunately they've switched to flavorless store bought croutons that are easily possible to avoid eating and I just pick them off.  I have to admit I now rate the salad a 4 instead of a 5 because of that.

Their lunch sandwiches that I have tried and loved include Grilled Chicken Aioli $6.99, Portabella Mushroom with tomato, onion, pepperjack and aioli $5.99, and the Blue Cheese Burger for $6.99.  I was not fond at all of their eggplant sandwich $6.99 but that could just be me.  I am a bit of a french fry lover and Brickhouse has THE best steak fries in town, hands down.  

There is a brick oven as you walk in and they make fantastic pizzas in there.  The lunch special every day is your choice of two... a soup or mixed green salad plus any 6\" pizza or a grilled cheese tomato sandwich for $7.99.  Pizza and a salad make another very generous sized lunch.  Even if you go for just a 6\" pizza they range from $4.99 for plain to $6.99 for multiple toppings.  Are you catching my drift?  For the price, this is a fantastic place for lunch if you want a sit down meal.

Now the not so good part.  Since their other restaurant opened the services has become spotty and erratic.  I waited an hour and 10 minutes one day because the server forgot to put our orders in and when we squawked she said we then got stuck behind two larger parties.  I was with 5 other people and pointed out this made me late to get back to work so she offered to get just my meal done for me.??  I have waited in the lobby to be seated for 25 minutes because the kitchen closed itself down until they caught up with themselves.  Why'd they get so behind and shut themselves down at 12:10 pm?  Because they took a lunch reservation for 22 people at noon and couldn't handle the volume.  I've also sat for 40 minutes in the bar area with 4 others while the servers repeatedly apologized that the kitchen was overwhelmed.  On the other hand, due to multiple years of eating here I've often had good and great, timely, spot-on service.  You simply never know what you're going to get and you need to be prepared for significant waits in case they aren't on their game that day.  It has caused me to eat there less frequently which is a shame because I really like this restaurant's food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an afternoon drink this past Sunday; nice patio with 5-7 tables. It wasn't very busy so we lucked out! With $4 drafts of all varieties you can't go wrong! They have some great bar specials during the week as well, including $2.50 drafts on Thursdays... that cannot be beat anywhere in the area!! Keep up the good work brickhouse, I'll be back to try your food !"}
{"text":"We started going to Brickhouse years ago when we lived in a location in Lincoln county, moved away but back and live in Davidson minutes from Brickhouse now. Was one of first places we went and still top of our list in the area. Really love their pizzas."}
{"text":"As a Lake Norman native, I've been to Brickhouse more times than I can count. It really has something for everybody.

I can't say it's historically been at the top of my list. I liked it just fine and the food was consistently good, but can't say I was ever wowed until recently.  I think the he recent growth and competition in the area really made Brickhouse step up their game. Their food options in recent years have improved and their prices remain moderate.   

I recently went in for dinner after learning of a food allergy. I had not eaten out in some time because I couldn't risk a goof up. I explained my situation to our waitress, who was an absolute doll. She brought the head chef over and he was equally great. He made a few suggestions and modifications, and then went to the kitchen to confirm the foods we were looking at, and their modifications, were safe. Upon returning, he even brought the packaging of the pita bread they use just to make sure I knew it was safe for me. 

He was very accommodating, as was our super sweet waitress. My food was delicious and made with love. So was my husband's. 

The decor is really great. Modern with an eclectic flair. The sound level is moderate, but gets louder in the bar area. Sadly, they no longer offer free Wifi - something my husband discovered when he went to meet a group of guys at work. They finished their first beer and went elsewhere because they needed Wifi. When I go there, it never crosses my mind. 

Overall, great restaurant in a great location with a great staff!"}
{"text":"If you like rude waitstaff, incredibly long waits, and sub par food, this place is for you. I've been here a few times and left disappointed each time. Way better options in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant, the decor is fun, the meatloaf was as good as grandmas and the caramel cheesecake was worth the mile run afterword. Service was courteous and the vibe was both professional and fun! Thanks for the great meal, definitely recommended!!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome staff! This place has a great Cajun chicken pasta and unbelievable bar food. Great for a quick seat at the bar for a beer and food or awesome food in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, I love the food and don't even mind that we always have to wait. What really bugs me is that I will be waiting for a good hour and see maybe 6 empty tables sitting there for more than 30 minutes. They really need a mature person handling the check in table and filling those empty tables. You are not big enough to afford to lose people because you have tables sitting there empty while you have 20 people waiting to sit and eat. We have learned to to go the bar and just wait for a bar table. its much faster and we come in, look at the empty table, wait, sit order and its still empty. What is with that. Wake up guys. The food is amazing  but we not go elsewhere if it seems like a crowd"}
{"text":"I live in Plaza-Midwood, where we have many great restaurants within walking distance of my house.  But, I have a friend who just got an apartment in Davidson and was excited to show me his new place.  \"And, we will get something to eat, too,\" he enthused.  So, I made the journey up 115 to meet him.  I marveled at his beautifully decorated crib, which was worth the drive alone, and then it was time to eat.
John took me to Brickhouse Tavern.  Although it was around 5:30 on a Friday night, we still had about a 25 minute wait.  So, I knew the food must be pretty good.
I ordered the eggplant parmesan, and John got the shrimp pasta primavera.  We both ordered a side salad; mine with blue cheese dressing and his with the house variety, a balsamic ginger.  Nice, fresh salads with the appropriate amount of dressing.  
When the entrees came, they were so large that they were practically spilling over the plates.  I chose to ignore my spaghetti and eat only the wonderfully breaded, cheese-covered eggplant.  I don't think that an Italian restaurant could have prepared it any better.  Crisp and flavorful!  John enjoyed his dish as well, and we both needed boxes at the end of the meal.
So, boo on me for thinking that all Davidson would have is chain restaurants and diners.  From the food to the service, I have absolutely no complaints. 
P.S.  Good wine pours as well."}
{"text":"My husband was in the mood for a burger, so I suggested Brickhouse for dinner. I got eggplant parm, which was meh - too mushy with chewy skin. The pasta that came with the eggplant was inedible due to the ridiculous amount of raw (RAW!) minced garlic mixed in. My husband could only smell the garlic, not the burger and fries in front of him. He did like his bburger alright."}
{"text":"Had the half roasted chicken and garlic mashed potatoes. My wife had the linguini with Cajun shrimp in a cream sauce. It was expertly prepared and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Update: The house beer is now $2.50! It's still a great little spot for lunch or dinner. Never had any issues with the quality of the food. 

The bar gets busy on Friday and Saturday nights but the dining room is always nice to sit in. They've updated the menu a bit and added some new things which I like a lot. 

The past few times we've gone the service has been great! We will continue to frequent Brickhouse for sure! They're on the usual rotation of dining establishments for us!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go in Davidson! Chicken Parm sandwich is awesome, highly recommend. Our wait was shorter than estimated, which is always good, and our server was fantastic! Will definitely be coming back to this place and would recommend it for anyone looking for a fun, casual place for dinner or drinks!"}
{"text":"Our friend who just moved up to Davidson had his birthday dinner here a few Mondays ago. While this is quite far for a Charlottean, I can see how this is a solid neighborhood joint for those who live in the North Mecklenburg neck of the wood. We had a big party, but the service did not suffer; our waiter was GREAT. The birthday boy ordered some appetizers for us to share, the Fried Calamari, Fried Asparagus and Nachos were all solid (which make them EXCELLENT choices given the price of each item). 

The drink special that nigh was $2 bottle of pumpkin beer, SCORE. Honestly, affordability is what I appreciate most about this place. You get LOTS of food for what you pay for (the pasta dishes are huge, you can make 2-3 meals out of one), and for the most part, the quality of food is fine. Granted I made a bad decision ordering a crab cake sandwich. Being a crab cake snob, I should have known better. Theirs were over-seasoned and over-breaded, not lump crab meat, and overly fried. SO if you are looking for lump crab cake that's boiled, DO NOT EVEN BOTHER. The mac-and-cheese side order was good though, and I'm pretty picky with my mac-and-cheese.

Brickhouse Tavern has stayed around for all these years for good reason, and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Pizza was chewy and tasteless...... this place used to be better......last two times we were here it was ordinary at best."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Brick House 2 to 3 times or week for the last few years.  Overall, our experiences have been positive but lately the food has been wildly inconsistent.  The new menu has its bright spots but lacks good sides to enjoy with dinner.  Vegetables are either under or over cooked and we miss the zucchini & squash.  

In many restaurants when there is a problem with the food a manager brings out the replacement dish to interact with the customer.  Not so at Brick House.  With the regular local clientel in Davidson, one would think management would take opportunities to make sure they knew the customers and make sure they are pleased. 

We always sit in the bar as it has a very nice environment. The waitstaff, especially Deena, Lorena, Matt & Jasmine are great.  We will keep trying and hoping things set better but things need to change. The kitchen needs to train their staff to keep up with the crowds.  We keep hoping for improvement."}
{"text":"Nice diverse menu, something for everyone. Have been here several times and both food and service was spot on. Huge selection of adult beverages. Separate dinning and bar/pub area is nice; the place has great aesthetics.

Lunch visits: Both visits were in the dining room. European Vegetable, Portabella Mushroom and burger are fantastic. Fries are just as good is not better than 5 guys.

Dinner visits: Both visits were in the pub/bar section after 7pm. Nachos and soft pretzels are large portions and delicious. Pizzas are good too; great crust and flavor. Beer has on the cheap especially local brews. Lots of Tvs 

I give this place 5/5 because for a pub it checks all the boxes."}
{"text":"Great food. Good atmosphere.  The service was quick. The Korean bbq chicken wings we Delish. Everyone in our party was pleased."}
{"text":"Got Davidson early, so I searched out a bar for a cocktail before dinner. Thanks to Yelp, I found the Brick. 

I didn't order food, but did try a dirty martini -- I've had better, but this bar doesn't look like martini's are ordered with frequency - so that is my fault, but you all know how I love me some dirty martini's. 

I really loved the atmosphere, the bar was large with TV's everywhere, the staff friendly, and the patrons funny. I really enjoyed my 50 minutes in there and hope to go back and try their food and a beer... as their selection is huge! 

This would def be a place I'd head out too, to watch me some football. A bit younger crowd, but all the same, I enjoyed myself. I like bars like that, where everyone know's your name...."}
{"text":"We recently visited teh Brickhouse in Davidson and enjoyed our time. The atmosphere was great as you could sit in a nice dining area or eat my the bar and watch a game if you would like. The service was good here, i think our server was somewhat new but did a great job. I had a pizza for an appetizer and thought that it was very good. The pepperoni on it was small and chunky which if i knew ahead of time, i probably would have avoided but i didn't and couldnt be happier. That pepperoni was so good and ive been obsessed with going back to get that pizza again. I had the Cajun Chicken Pasta for an entree which i heard was excellent. Id say the sauce was a bit thick but i dont mind that as a problem, def prefer that over it being too thin. Had a nice spice to it and welcomed an above average pasta dish in this area which for me, has been hard to find! Brickhouse was a good time and it caters to any occasion."}
{"text":"Drink: Southern Sweet Tea (the one with liquor)
Appetizers: fried asparagus; fried oysters; golden calamari; buffalo wings; fried ravioli; seated tuna; crab cakes. All amazing!"}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp after a track meet on our way home Thursday evening.  All food, beverages, and service was great.  However, our waiter was not the best.  He seemed to have a chip on his shoulder toward women.  I'm not discounting our overall experience for this one individual though.  Thursday was a great evening as ALL draft beers were $2.50!  Awesome!  We loved the decor and setting in this really cool old building.  I highly recommend checking it out and we'll definitely return next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Went here on Monday for lunch with Trisha's Race Shop Tours. I had the house salad with the grilled tuna.  salad was great, and the tuna was one of the best pieces of fish I have ever eaten, and I do not usually even eat fish. was a great meal on a great day"}
