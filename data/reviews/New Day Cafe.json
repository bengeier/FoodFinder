{"text":"I love the chocolate chip pancakes and the protein omelet! Breakfast just like mom used to make it!"}
{"text":"The breakfast is pretty decent. I go here on the weekends with my son when we don't want to wait 45 minutes for IHOP. Try the cactus jack! It's an egg omelette with Nopales, chorizo and cheese. Such an original yummy item!"}
{"text":"Thought I would stop in this morning and have a wonderful breakfast to start my holiday weekend....well that didn't happen. Service was pathetic...I think my waitress was the Grinch's wife or girlfriend. I was disappointed by the food and the inattentive service for sure.  One small cup of coffee for $2.29 is ridiculous and once she served that I never saw her again at my table till my food was served 15 minutes later.  Eggs Benedict happens to be one of my favorites, but today it was lack luster, served barely warm and looked like it had been waiting on the service line for awhile.  Then to top it off why would you used a iceberg lettuce leaf for garnish under the fruit.  I  usually tip way to much but today was not your waitress day  I won't be back...."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the staff was very friendly. I would recommend it to any one who comes out of town and is on vacation. It's great food at a good price."}
{"text":"This breakfast & lunch place opened up by my pad and we figured we would give it a shot.  It is right next to Al Mazza at Silverado Ranch and Maryland.  Happily impressed with our quick and efficient breakfast!  Very fast service and our food was on the table within 10 minutes or so - fantastic.  Food was on point, nothing spectular but we just ordered a basic breakfast.  Three stars, but giving it an extra boost since it is 2 minutes from my house.  The place is clean and the servers friendly.  It looked well established despite only being open for a few weeks.  Searching yelp shows there is another location that has been open longer on the other side of town - explaining why they are on point already.  Come and eat a quick and easy breakfast or lunch here.  Saturday morning at 10am the place only had a few tables used, the signage is really bad so probably no one knows about this place.  Much better choice then IHOP or waiting 35 minutes at Sunrise Cafe - esp if you are in a hurry :)  Keep up the good work, I will be back."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. If you are looking for a Denny's or IHOP, THIS IS NOT IT!!  Breakfast items include omellettes(?), wraps, scrambles; a la carte items, french toast, pancakes, sausage patties, biscuits & gravy...spice it up, tone it down.  They do have a lunch menu but I've not ordered from it.   I tend to order the breakfast sandwich: egg, bacon, cheese on a biscuit. Servers will say they're not sure if it can be made that way...I've had it twice. IT CAN BE DONE!!  And its AMAZEBALLS!!  Servers are super nice, you don't wait long for your order.  They do serve beer for breakfast...kinda cool but not my thing.  Portions are large.   I only gave 4 stars because.....their hours. 7-3.  I live across the street. Can't stop in for breakfast to go, even if I tried.  There's no time. I can't help but wonder how much business they are losing by not opening an hour earlier??"}
{"text":"This is a throw-back to a neighborhood cafe.  Service was excellent, food and portions were excellent as well.  A family atmosphere, friendly and good old home-style cooking make this a must for locals."}
{"text":"New Day Cafe is a nice spot to grab breakfast, and it is not as busy as some of the other breakfast hot spots on this side of town.  They have healthy options, low carb, egg whites, etc.  The staff is friendly and the food typically arrives quickly."}
{"text":"sucks! food sucks waitress mad she has to work, toast cold, steak chewy , never again! go to egg works or rise n shine.  water is pure chlorine ! this place is worse than dennys!"}
{"text":"There are very few breakfast joints that I enjoy. I'm not a fan of the tasteless IHOP or Dennys creations and I don't like the small confined noisy atmosphere of Egg Works or the like. New Day provides the right atmosphere with delicious breakfasts at a good price.   The New Day Combo is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Awesome and friendly service. Cinnamon rolls were the best part of the meal. Very awkward that the server takes the order through an app on her own cellphone."}
{"text":"I LOVE going to this place for brunch!  They offer some traditional Mexican favorites, such as chorizo, chilaquiles, and machaca.  The dishes are really flavorful, and don't require a liberal use of salt (something that is rare for me!).  They also offer healthy fares and the traditional stuff like waffles, pancakes, etc.  The coffee is good, but not great.    In my opinion, this particular location has yet to hit its stride; I think the main set-back is that the restaurant decor doesn't match the ambiance of the restaurant, e.g., the black leather dinner chairs seem to be at odds with the home cooked food.   Nonetheless, I really, REALLY hope that more people discover this location and start making it out.  The restaurant is clean, the food is good, the employees are friendly, and the service is great.  And it blows Denny's and all those other crappy breakfast diners away."}
{"text":"I was super happy to hear that a breakfast/lunch restaurant had opened so close to home and I was waiting for New Day to work the kinks out before trying.  My husband and I decided today was the day, and I don't really want to bash this place, but it's average at best.  We both ordered hamburgers cooked medium with fries, and while the fries arrived hot, the burgers were room temperature and cooked well done-no pink.  I suppose it's difficult to have any pink in a burger that comes out of the freezer already cooked...yes, it appears that the burger patties they put on the grill are precooked and frozen.  The burger was bland and the bun was the small/average size you would buy at the market.  The burger itself did have a small piece of lettuce, 2 small rings of red onion and a couple pickles, but no side of mayo, thousand island, nothing...there was ketchup on the table, but I had to ask for mustard.  I asked for a side of dressing and was charged .75, and while I certainly don't mind paying for it, it would have been nice if the gal informed me there would be an upcharge.  We saw lots of omelets passing by us and they looked really good.  My husband and I have agreed to go back one more time and try the omelets.  Upon doing so, I will amend/revise my review."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT service, GREAT food, a great family restaurant! Their french toast was great, but what was nice was that there was something for everyone in our family.  Half of us wanted breakfast and the other half wanted lunch, it was great!! We will definitely be frequenting the New Day Cafe!!"}
{"text":"New Day Cafe is one of those off-the-strip \"mom n pops\" restaurants that get little attention but have the BEST FOOD and great service! Plus you can order anything off the menu (including drinks and champagne) anytime of the day ;) . My husband and I go here every time we come to Vegas , you ought to try it!!"}
{"text":"Food: Average  Service: Ok  Early Sunday afternoon and the server tells me the fryer is \"down\" because the cooks are cleaning it. Who cleans a fryer in the middle of lunch service on a Sunday? Then I over here the same server, she was the only one that seemed to be working, tell a guest that they were out a BBQ sauce...again, Sunday lunch, Smith's and Alberston's are within walking distance.   We wanted to love it..maybe if they had a busser or another set of hands to help."}
{"text":"Great choice for breakfast.  Haven't had lunch here yet. Plates are generous and the prices are reasonable.  I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo. Very tasty without being spicy. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday AM. Right around the corner from my house, I have been wanting to try it since it opened.   The was a single waitress working, but thankfully it was pretty quiet by the time we got there. The menu is standard breakfast and lunch fare, nothing really too fancy. I am addicted to pancakes, so I get then in a combo wuth eggs and patty sausage. It wasen't bad, about the level of IHOP. I think Blueberry Hill and Origional Pancake House does a better flapjack.  The DH got an omlette that was just average, or so he said. I did try his home fries, and they were very inconsistant, some bits were uncooked potato! Not very good.  Best part for me is the house coffee they serve. It's not Illy, but another Italian chi-chi brand (i'll post the name later) that was excellent. No need to hit up Starbucks afterwards, it was deep and rich.  I'll probably eat there again, but i'm in no rush. Good because it's so close. I miss the old business that used to be there, Las Palmas!"}
{"text":"Great service, price, and food.  Waitress was very friendly and checked back with us several times."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based on reviews. Everything looked okay until we ordered food.   Server brought out soups with entrees so my entree gets cold. I ordered the huevos a  la mexicana and they were mediocre at best. Not a good impression if this was a \"house dish\".  I've had better eggs from a roach coach at my work. My wife ordered the Buffalo chicken wrap and I only tasted hot sauce.    Server came around only once to ask if everything was ok and for refills. Server did not clear plates so I had to stack my dirty plates in order to have room to be able to eat my entree.   After finishing my meal I had to wait for the server to return from her break or wherever she had gone so I could pay. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Visiting from Sam Francisco, we came for breakfast. Clean and spacious with excellent wait staff, we were expecting the food to live up to the ambience. Unfortunately, except for great coffee and excellently prepared eggs, it did not. The bacon has been in the warming tray too long, the hollandaise was mediocre, and the hash browns were so bad we sent them back only to have them replaced by something similar.   1 star is for coffee and eggs, 1 star is for wait staff."}
{"text":"The service was great. The staff was very friendly. The food came out really fast so the little ones didn't have to wait. There was a good amount of people in the restaurant on a weekend, but the staff was still friendly."}
{"text":"I thought this would be a nice place for a breakfast on a saturday with friends after reading mostly good reviews on yelp and google.  NOT.  Not only was our order not correct the first time, the food was meh.  The eggs were boring the sausage over cooked, the toast dry and cold, and my friends protein power omelet smelled like bad fish (just so you know... no fish in her omelet... it was supposed to be steak).    While our server was very friendly and helpful (the only reason it got two stars), I would not go here again."}
{"text":"After hearing fairly good things about this restaurant, we decided to try it, of all days, on Mother's Day. Now I understand that a breakfast place will be busy on Mother's Day, but we didn't experience any wait. Not only that, but they let us put our name on the wait list via a phone call. Upon arrival, we walked in and right to a table. This is where is started to go down hill.   It took quite a while to get our drinks once ordered. Most of us drank coffee or water. My brother ordered an orange juice, which took them about a half hour to bring, later informing us that the juices machine was having problems. It happens. We ordered our food.  There was 6 adults and 1 child that we ordered for. It took them approximately 45 minutes for the first of us to get our food after we ordered. I say this because my wife, who ordered eggs Benedict, had to send hers back because the eggs were cooked far too hard. My son, which we ordered mini pancakes and sausage, came out with bacon instead. My poor sister in law didn't even get hers for about another 15-20 minutes after. She ordered a BLT with no mayo. Would you believe it? Once it finally came, there was mayo on it. She also ordered a side of soup. It never came. They said they had to remake the soup. This was almost an hour after we ordered and after the rest of us had received our food. She ordered french fries as a sub. She never received those either. Toast was included with the rest of our meals, which none of us received, even after asking/reminding 2-3 times. It also took my wife's meal another 10 minutes to get fixed, which when finished, she said tasted pretty bad.   The part that topped this all off was we asked for the manager on a couple of occasions in order to voice our concerns. We never did speak to a manager. We didn't even see what appeared to be someone in charge walking around the restaurant. So basically we were just ignored.  The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because of our waitress, who based on the name on the check, I'm pretty sure was named Chelsea. You could see she was working as hard as she could and that her day was hectic. She did everything she could. Hopefully they'll reward her for the hard work she did.   All in all, we will never be back. The food was mediocre at best and riddled with a myriad of mistakes. Coupled with the bad service, with the exception of Chelsea, this place isn't worth it. No wonder the one on South Rainbow went out of business."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast. The service sucked. The waitress unknowledgeable about the menu. Food was just ok. Nothing special nothing that makes them stand out. I can make all the same stuff at home. Bottom line we'll never return."}
{"text":"What a great place to grab a bite. Home style cooking and friendly service. Reminds me of the small diners back in New York.  We each had the breakfast combo. One with bacon and French toast and the other with pancakes and sausage patty.Everything came out hot and everything was good. Nothing fancy.  If you're looking for gourmet, keep moving. This is just good old comfort food and decent prices. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The New Day Cafe has gone well beyond my expectations! Screw Denny's and IHOP, this place has much better food and way better service! I usually order the Biscuits with Gravy and being a cook myself, can tell the gravy is homemade. Then to add on to the greatness of this place, the service is extremely fast! A homemade meal in under 15 minutes? How much better could this place be? AND besides all this, the prices are lower than a sloppy breakfast at IHOP or any Denny's! Overall, I would totally recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop into this place one morning for breakfast one morning and I had never been there before. I sat at the counter top and my server, Jimena, immediately greeted me with a warm smile and welcomed me. I asked her for recommendations and she suggested a few items on the menu. The food was good but the service was even better. I don't normally write reviews, but I am in the service industry and truly appreciate good service. Thank you, Jimena, for a great experience."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Had the daily specials. We thought the waitress was in a bad mood until we saw her being friendlier to the patrons around us. She also neglected to tell my girlfriend her dish had jalapeños after I said to her that she doesn't like spicy foods. First experience was lack luster overall"}
{"text":"Great family spot if you're in the area.    Can get pretty busy on weekends but the seating and service remains efficient. Wait times are short if at all.   The daily specials are usually something from south of the border and the rest of the menu is a nice spin on breakfast/brunch.     I heard there was a bar there too..."}
{"text":"The food is great ! It comes out quick and looks very appealing. We were very tired and hung over and having a good healthy breakfast meal was very important. I must say this was my first breakfast in Las Vegas and it was amazing. The Cinnabon wasn't home maid like I read in other reviews before picking the location but the main meal definitely made up for it . Awesome place to come.  Quick but with quality"}
{"text":"THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION FOR NO STAR BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY WOULD GET!!!  I had a groupon, other than that I would never have gone in, even though it is close to where I live and I pass it all the time.  Even with 1/2 off, prices are still high.  Go to Egg Works Rainbow/Badura, instead.  Where do I begin.  We went in the a.m., ordered breakfast.  Not a lot of people.  About 4 other tables.  Placed our order, waited for food.  In walks in a man, by himself.  Has his order taken, immediately gets on his cell phone talking english/spanish.  He is loud, rude and obnoxious.  Doesn't put down the cell, until his food comes so he can stuff it shut.  Other than that, he would still be on the cell.  We are trying to eat and conversate ourselves, however, not when rude a$$hole won't shut up.  We are waiting for the waitress or owner, somebody, to tell him to keep it down or turn it off.  Nothing at all.  We pack our food to go.  We pay and we ask to speak to the owner.  Were told they are at their other location on Maryland.  Asked for their phone number.  Asked the waitress if the a$$hole was a regular or family member/owners friend, as to why she didn't bother to ask the guy to tone it down, or turn it off.  She replied, \"If you would have said something, then I would have.  Livid isn't even close to what we were feeling at that time.   THIS IS AMERICA, SINCE WHEN DID IT COME TO, PATRONS HAVE TO INITIATE A COMPLAINT, FIRST, IN ORDER TO GET A RUDE AND OBNOXIOUS A$$HOLE OFF THE CELL?????????  Obviously, they were more considerate to the a$$hole, than the other families eating there.  We left and called the owners, Arturo and Teresa at the Maryland Pkwy. location and were told, \"they weren't there\".  We were given their cell number and have never received a call back, ever!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Clean, great service, fresh food, great coffee, good prices. Something for everybody. Came with 5 people and every person liked their meal. We ordered lunch and breakfast items. Would def recommend and would return if in the area again."}
{"text":"Cute local shop. Good prices n service. Had a chicken club - great! And an abs burger- not good. Fries are standard. Will try for bfast soon !"}
{"text":"Overpriced snacks! I ordered enchiladas for 9$. They gave me two enchiladas 2 eggs N a tablespoon of beans and 2 chips. Smallest plate I seen in a long time. If your on a diet this is the place to be. If u hungry and want a man size meal skip this joint."}
{"text":"Went here with a Groupon the other day, which is probably only way I would go back. Nothing was terrible at this place, but nothing was great either. I had the TBA melt and my wife had the Tuna Manhattan. For \"melts\" both severely lacked some cheese. Neither of us were thrilled with what we got, but both finished them if that says much.   Then for the kids I split a burger between them, (wasn't going to do more than that since they charge $5.49 for this.) Burger was flat and eh when i tried it. Then for Fries it looked like we got the crumbs at the bottom of the bag for the most part, with only a few good fries. I'd be happier with a 6 dollar burger combo at Carl's Jr over this one.   Service was fine, they took our order, brought our food then our check. Nothing more, which is fine with me."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try a new place for breakfast after watching the grandkids soccer game.   They seated us reasonably fast which was good but so many options on the menu.   While I was waiting for our breakfast I decided to get a vanilla shake to hold me over during the wait.  It came pretty fast which was nice.    The food was good but took awhile to get out to us.   The food was good for a breakfast spot but plan on slow service if it's busy."}
{"text":"Was excited to find a place that served Crepes, although it wasn't the best it was def edible. Asked for sour dough toast and got regular toast with barely any butter and barely toasted at all. I love potato products but was quite disappointed with the cold stale hash browns I ordered on the side. I wont be back, was just hoping for a better experience at a place close to home."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for breakfast in Dec 2017 while house shopping. Service was prompt and friendly. Fast forward to Feb 2018 when we had just arrived on the red eye from Honolulu and we wanted a place to stop for breakfast. A total different experience!! Our server \"Jenny\" was curt and rude. When she took our order it was with short commands and she snatched the menus from our table. I noticed she was nicer to other patrons of the same color as her. FYI my husband just completed 20 years of military service to this great country and for her to be so rude was very disappointing. I didn't want to make a scene and ruin our first day home. The food was ok nothing to brag about, but the service was terrible. We will not return."}
{"text":"Ummm don't know what the big deal is our waitress was crabby the bathroom stunk like sewer would have chosen IHOP but wanted to try something different potatoes were not great egg was ok won't be back"}
{"text":"I love this place for a good weekend spot to get breakfast or brunch. My husband likes thier sandwhiches and biscuits and gravy. I love their new day combo...two pancakes/french toast eggs and sausage.  I recently took an older friend of mine and she liked her patty melt I go with my husband, parents, and friends. It is never overfilled and the service is excellent. I also love thier latte selection. You can also go on restaurants.com to get gift certificates for both locations"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat on the weekend. The employees are always pleasant, especially the girl who cashes you out and seats you. Their biscuits and gravy, and tortilla soup is SO good. And, its super affordable. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best place ever  Why did they close permanently???????? No more cactus jack omelette for me I love this place. I'm very disappointed they closed."}
{"text":"Stopped in last weekend, a buy one, get one coupon brought me in. I had the western omelet with hashbrowns. Straight-forward, but nicely prepared. Appreciated the cheese being on the inside of the omelet, and the hashbrowns were of the shredded variety. Often, I'll get breakfast potatoes when hashbrowns are noted. They weren't greasy, either which was another plus. My sister had a wrap that she enjoyed. And my three year old nephew liked his chicken tenders, and fishy coloring mat. Service was friendly and prices were reasonable. It's nice to have another breakfast option close to home."}
{"text":"Nice and bright, windows all around.......Good breakfast, with reasonable price.  Good food selection and fresh.   Wait staff is prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast and lunch.  I've enjoyed every meal I've had,  especially the breakfast enchiladas and eggs. Service is prompt and the servers are friendly. This restaurant is a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Sweet baby Jesus!  The chorizo breakfast quesadilla is amazing! Not to much chorizo which is the downfall of other breakfast burritos/quesadillas, just the perfect amount of cheese, egg and chorizo!"}
{"text":"New Day Cafe is my favorite place to get breakfast. I've been going here since their old location and I've always enjoyed their food. Their staff is friendly and efficient. I like to get the New Day Combo with soft scrambled eggs, bacon, and french toast. Their syrup isn't sweet, many people don't like it but I prefer it less sweet anyways. I also like to get the Eggs and Bacon with hash browns and toast. The setting of this place is nice for breakfast because it used to be a nice dinner restaurant. I also love that there's a patio seating for a day with nice weather. I've been going here since their old location and they have most definitely grown. This place is always packed with customers!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast I had the new day combo French toast eggs and bacon my wife had the california omelet. Omg this will be our regular stop it's great!"}
{"text":"I came here with a restaurant.com coupon and even at the discounted price, this place was still not worth it. I came with a party of 3, ordered the huevos mexicana, full stack of pancakes, rueben sandwich, and french toast sandwich.   The huevos mexicana was very unimpressive in both looks and taste. I could've made a better egg dish at home, no doubt about it. The french toast sandwich was tasty and definitely something different. The rueben sandwich tasted fine, but it was tiny. The stack of pancakes was pathetic for $6.   We also ordered a large glass of orange juice, which tasted like incredibly watered down concentrate. I ordered a vanilla latte and that was like villa flavored hot chocolate.   Our bill totaled $30 at the end of the meal after the $25 coupon. I would much rather go to a Station $6 breakfast buffet. It would have tasted better and wouldve left us more satisfied."}
{"text":"Great food. Accommodated our very large group on St. Patrick's Day! Great food. There were seperate checks and they got that right"}
{"text":"Went once for a sit down breakfast and once for a carry out. Both times the service was super slow. When I picked up my carry out 15 minutes after placing it, I still had to wait an additional 15 minutes at the restaurant. While waiting I even saw customers walking up to their waitress and asking how much longer. The staff seems to be disorganized and lacks communication. The good is good, nothing special. Service could be better."}
{"text":"If you have never had good food, you might not notice how cheap the ingredients are in this place. Sent the coffee back twice. Bitter, burnt, cheap brew. Ordered scrambled eggs. They admitted they came from an egg batter. Not fresh. Bacon was black and cold. Husband had a fruit smoothie. Also a mix. He had eggs Benedict. Hollandaise sauce was bitter salty and most likely out of a can from the dollar store. Save your money. Prices were average. McDonalds does a better job. The only positive I have is that our server was great."}
{"text":"starting to make the rounds in my new neighborhood - today, breakfast at the New Day .   Meat omelet, coffee = $11 - pretty standard stuff, nothing out of the ordinary.  The thing is, while eating the omelet i start to realize.....there's little to no taste ! it's supposed to have bacon, ham and sausage and i see some sort of meat in there - but no taste  !! reminds me of the beer commercial where it's raining outside and guys are running around slurping up the rain yelling, \" it's raining beer, it's raining beer ! \"  other then that,  nothing else to report , ho-hum"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood cafe. Pleasant, smiling servers.  Good, hearty food.  Clean, comfortable restaurant.  Just perfect for Saturday breakfast!"}
{"text":"A couple of miles south of the main Strip area, down around the South Point casino, New Day Cafe is a local breakfast place not well known to tourists.  Eggs and toast, Huevos Rancheros, potatoes and pancakes, if you are looking for a traditional breakfast with a local flavor, you are in the right place.  Located in a strip mall, it's a tidy and clean place and seems to have a lot of regular customers.  The day we were there, a large contingent of motorcycle enthusiasts showed up, and the parking lot became like a museum of classic German, English and Japanese motorcycles.  Everyone seemed to be having a good time.  Good place.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"I'm sure this place will improve with time, however...my kiddo got frozen chicken fingers, my tortilla soup was below average, and service was slow (although our waitress was very sweet). The bill came with no itemized list so there was no way to check accuracy.  I'll give it a little while before I'll return and update post then."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and enjoyed the food each time. Good value for your money. I gave it four because my girlfriend was not too impressed the one time she came and she is more of a foodie than I am."}
{"text":"This place should be no less than 4 stars if not 4.5 stars for the quality of food and service.  Anyone complaining about anything else is just being unfair.  I had the corn beef hash and eggs and it may be if not the best one I've had.  Price was cheaper than anywhere else ($7.99) and the service was excellent.  Coffee is also quality grade.  I give this place, New Day, my full recommendation."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!!  They have a variety of breakfast selections.  Staff was very friendly and they all seemed to work together instead of having one server assigned to a table..being that it's such a small place, it's probably a good idea.  We'd definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"At lunch today, I had their Turkey Club, with fries.  It didn't stand out as the best club I have ever had, but it was good.  It was thick on Turkey and Bacon, a very good thing.  They also had a variety of bread choices to go with it: white, wheat, sourdough, and rye.  It wasn't really a 5-star standout lunch, but it was good enough that I would go back if in the area."}
{"text":"My family and I had a wonderful breakfast here with great service. We came around 10am on Sunday morning and the 5 of us were seated within a couple minutes. The menu has a typical selection of a morning breakfast diner. My wife had bacon and eggs, my kids had chocolate chip cookie pancakes, and I had the crepe and eggs. I was happy to see that these were properly made banana crepes with powdered sugar since decent crepes are hard to find. The staff were friendly and the food came quick - I will defiantly be going many times into the future!"}
{"text":"This is a new place in the area that I work in. I tried the Reuben and it is absolutely great ! I've heard mixed reviews that their service was bad and food was expensive. If two people can order breakfast under $20, I don't think you can get any cheaper than that especially for a local mom and pop shop. I will definitely order and try more items in the future. It was busy but the environment seems very warming. My to go order was supplied with forks knives and ketchup which I appreciated a lot. I will come back !"}
{"text":"Great place! Service is awesome, they are personable and make you feel welcome. Food is excellent! I eat at least once a week, more if possible. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very close to our house so we have stopped here a few times. If you want a fast breakfast that is plain and straight up, you found your spot. Nothing special.  I think they have some special chorizo items but we don't eat that so have not tried them.  We get egg whites and fruit and their bagels are perfectly toasted. Their coffee is good and always hot and fresh. Plus they have Sugar in the Raw :) Service is ALWAYS very friendly and sweet."}
{"text":"Just amazing home style soul food. Lovely service and the greet with a smile happy employees here always checking if anything is needed and Mandy was our server. She is amazing young lady."}
{"text":"Close café near our place that I have been to a couple other times. They have good menu with breakfast and lunch and are open until 3pm. Everything I have ordered has been good and comes out quick. Service after the food comes out is a different story, the servers seem to gravitate towards the bar area and hover and talk. There is probably 15-20 minutes in between each check in with their guests. The coffee is really good although it is $2.50, which is kind of steep for a cafe? Also the omelet prices are deceiving and you will end up with a 12$ omelet in no time. This last time I ordered fruit as a side and it definitely looked about 2 weeks old. The food is decent, but there are much better restaurants in town."}
{"text":"The veggie omelet was uneventful. The potatoes were served cold. The rest if or party liked their pancakes and French toast. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Average at best.  Stay home and make your food instead.  Atmosphere is blah, food is blah, coffee is blah and it was hot in the restaurant.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"The boyfriend likes coming here, and I couldn't deny him anything on his birthday. I've only been here twice, and the first time was New Year's Day 2015.  It's honestly convenient for us when we want to eat in a sit-down kinda breakfast place 'cause it's about 5 minutes away from his house. They honestly do serve decent food though, and the food always comes out fast and still freshly cooked.  As for food, I wasn't a fan of the Corned Beef Hash & Eggs. I do like the Huevos a la Mexicana though. I think I appreciate the fresh ingredients in this dish more than anything. The boyfriend always likes ordering their Patty Melt 'cause they cook the meat the way he likes it (medium rare). Decent sized portions as well, but flavor-wise there isn't anything amazing to make me want to keep going back.  Service is alright here. The waitresses we've had don't really strike up conversations or anything, but they're on top of their game whenever we go. The establishment is always clean and organized, which is another thing I can appreciate."}
{"text":"In the mood to have a breakfast adventure that was off the usual weekend rotation, I dug through the coupon book and found this cafe, located in the southernmost region of Las Vegas, not far from South Point Casino/Hotel.  Upon ordering, I presented the coupon, and it was honored, no questions asked (businesses that lure me in with deals they don't honor, don't get my business).  The wife ordered one of the specialty omelettes, with steak, cheddar cheese, onion, and made with egg whites.  I tasted it, and it was pretty good.  She used some Tabasco to give it kick.  It came with fruit on the side (orange, honey dew, and watermelon).  The cost was $8.99.  I had the egg cheese, and steak quesadilla for the same price.  It came with salsa, guacamole, and sour creme on the side.  It was huge and tasty. We both had coffee at $1.99 each. The child ordered chocolate chip pancakes for $2.99 at ate every bite.  Compared to other small businesses specializing in breakfast and lunch, this place had an innovative menu that would be good for the person watching the diet, as well as the person craving the higher calorie dishes.  Service was prompt and quite good (thanks Blanca!)."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and have enjoyed both visits. The staff is very friendly, the prices are reasonable, and the menu offers a number of choices.  Other reviews have mentioned that the food is bland but I did not find that to be so. Maybe that is because I am not looking for a twist to my club sandwich. I think it is good, solid fare.  This is definitely a nice neighborhood restaurant - I just wish that I did not live on the other side of town. We will certainly return for another visit and I will venture off the sandwich menu to see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Actually liked this place, good lunch specials.... Decent Bloody Mary. Food could use a bit more flavor. Like the staff, love that you can see chefs thru the window while they cook your food!! Should be open longer!!! :("}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday on our way back home from Las Vegas. The place was relatively empty and they sat our large party right away. The waitress was incredibly nice and was very talkative to our group.  Other then that, I don't have to much good stuff to say. Our meal took almost 45 minutes to prepare and when we got it, it was cold and not tasty. They overcooked both steak and eggs (asked for rare, received well done). While I can understand we had a decently large group - 8 people - but all cold meals is a little upsetting. I doubt this is how every meal is but just rating my first time experience."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. I had a carnitas skillet that had just the right amount of spice. My husband had the breakfast crepes-delicious. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant offre Breakfast et Lunch Avec un large choix de plats, boissons et même un menu enfant très abordable! Cela vaut le coup de s'éloigner légèrement du strip de Vegas pour prendre un repas dans un cadre simpler et calme avec un personnel très accueillant."}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp and decided to come here for breakfast. It was easy to find on the corner of Silverado and Bermuda near the 7-Eleven and Jack in the Box. I parked and walked inside.  I was greeted as I entered and sat at the counter. Because I looked at the menu online before, I knew what I wanted to get. I ordered a Tommy B. Veggie Omelet (egg whites with mushrooms, bell peppers, tomato, and spinach) with cottage cheese and toasted wheat slices of bread. It didn't long for my food to arrive and while I normally wouldn't pay so much for an omelet, it was pretty big and by the time I finished everything, I was quite full so it worked out.  The decor was a bit plain, but there was lots of tables as well as space at the counter. While I ate, I watched the TV in front of me. If I have time to sit down and eat breakfast somewhere, I wouldn't mind coming back here again."}
{"text":"Big fan and now make it our favorite weekend breakfast place. Good food, service and prices."}
{"text":"Drove by this restaurant for the past few years, but xmas eve decided to give it a try. Small place but good service and large menu. I got a bacon, egg and cheese bagel, my wife got an omlette and I also ordered a side of biscuits and gravey. All were tasty and will definitely go back as it was a good value."}
{"text":"A good lunch place!  Only being open for breakfast and lunch, I've only dined here for lunch.  The dining area is large and clean.  Service here has dropped a bit over the last few years but the food has kept on par.    Their TBA melt is still my usual order.  Turkey, bacon and avocado on sourdough is tasty!  Fries on the side more than enough to satisfy my hunger.  I keep hoping they add sweet potato fries to the menu to make me smile even more!   Until then, they serve a good lunch with hopes the service goes back to greatness."}
{"text":"Came in today, Sunday, and the place wasn't too busy. We were seated, waited 10 minutes at our table and not even once were we asked what we wanted to drink. Our waiter never acknowledge our presence. Another party was seated after us in her section and she went ahead and took their drink orders and proceeded to take their food order. Meanwhile we were left at the table waiting. Terrible service. Never greeted when we walked in. We left the place and went over to Sunrise Cafe. It was truly a terrible first impression and my family and I will never come back."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here this morning with my wife and we were pleased. We live in the area and have been hesitant on giving them a chance based on their reviews. We had the eggs Benedict and country Benedict, eggs on both were cooked perfectly. We will be here again soon!"}
{"text":"Food was bland and only partly edible. I got the New Day Special. Two eggs, bacon, and pancakes. The pancakes were not fluffy, they were actually tough. I am quite certain they were a product of Chef Mic. You should not need a steak knife to cut your pancakes. Eggs were fine. Bacon was nice a crisp.   Service, this place does not have enough staff to serve the customers. We waited at least 45 minutes for our food. We waited at least 15 minutes to place our drink order.  I would not recommend this place to anyone. I highly considered giving one star but I went with two..."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my brunch here. The service was attentive, the food was great and I really enjoyed the healthy diet friendly options on the menu.  Thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Definitely a place to stop in from time to time. Came here a few times a couple years ago when they first opened but they started changing the business hours so it was never open when I stopped in.  Decided to try it out again today with a friend and we had a blast. The food was delicious (just as I recalled) and the service was spot on, the place wasn't busy, but I was still surprised to find my glass was never less then halfway before a refill was being poured.  Its a bit smaller then a a winged section at Dennys but the floor plan is similar, tables through the center and booths on either side. As of this writing their hours are 6AM-3PM with a few 'early bird specials' from 6-9 (which my friend said he'll be coming back for)."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to go for a fast informal and inexpensive lunch someplace close to our house. We had heard about the New Day Cafe recently opening and wanted to give it a try Ambiance: very basic decorating. Several booths and tables. No tablecloths. Paper napkins. A TV on the back wall. Pretty much what you would expect from a restaurant serving only breakfast and lunch. Service: Jessica, our server,  was at our table pretty soon after we sat down to get our beverage order.  The food came out in a timely fashion and Jessica came back to check to make sure that everything was going well. Food: I had the California omelette with hash browns and an English muffin. The Omelette was quite good. The hash browns and English muffin were pretty much what you'd expect from a breakfast and lunch place.  Overall, it's nice to have a place that serves breakfast and lunch so close to the house. However they have tough competition in that there is Kneaders and Eggworks and IHOP and Denny's all within a few miles. And all of them do the same thing, at the same price point, with a more extensive menu."}
{"text":"Came in for Father's Day. Worst experience. I'm just going to say 2 things to sum up my experience.   1. Gave my sister a dirty cup with lip stick still from whomever drank the cup last.  2. Messed up my order when I specifically asked for no pico on my burrito and I wanted French fries instead of hash browns.   Never coming again"}
{"text":"Food wasn't nothing to rave about. Actually below average. For $8 I got the new day Combo, which came with 2 eggs, 2 bacon, and 1 slice of french toast. French Toast was sad. Looks like they use very cheap bread as the bread was sunk in much like you would get at a casino buffet. The flavor had a hint of orange to it as well.  A family member ordered the Chirizo and Eggs and said it was very bland.   Service was good which is why I am giving them 2 stars. They had open tables at 11 am on a sunday. Most places are to capacity due to the church crowds and late sleepers. That should have been my first hint to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Me and a friend ordered some breakfast a few months ago. The service was ok and I would've given them 4 or 5 stars but the waitress forgot to supply us with eating utensils. We had to hail down a staff member to get it. I'll give this place another chance but if they fail to meet basic expectations I'm done."}
{"text":"I've gotten breakfast here (take-out) a few times, and these guys usually do a pretty good job. So I was completely disappointed when I got home and found that they had included burnt bacon in my last order. I mean totally crispy, black, burnt. I'll think twice before going here again."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast with my husband and parents on a Saturday morning.   It's a small place so I expected a homey feel, but didn't quite get that. Our waitress was okay. She didn't introduce herself or carry a conversation with us. We weren't sure what we wanted to order and we asked her to give us 5 minutes. She came back 10 minutes later.. Again, the place isn't very big, but we were unable to get her attention since we didn't know her name and she didn't make eye contact with us! She was the only waitress we saw ... this seems odd given this was a Saturday morning.   The food was your average breakfast. I could have cooked the same breakfast at home.    Our waitress took her sweet time when it came to giving us our check. I mean, when you're ready to go, you're ready to go.   I will not go back to this place."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all!!! Was excited about a new breakfast spot so close to Inspirada. Had the steak omelette, had to send it back because it was gross. Thought the veggie omelette would be safe and it wasn't, was so nasty. I would rather cook at home vs wasting $30 on a lower than mediocre breakfast. Bad experience, will not be back. I'll stick with The Original Sunrise Cafe on Eastern even though it's a little farther :)"}
{"text":"I always drove by this place but they caught my eye with their Mobile Advertising Beetle (orange and yellow) fully wrapped in Vinyl parked in their lot. I thought it was cool! It was a breakfast joint that I had to try! Place was quite cozy and staff were corteous and bubbly. The menu offered typical American breakfast and lunch dishes you would find at any other diner type establishment.   The goods:   Eggs Benedict with hash browns: it looked like a normal eggs benedict, nothing special but I did like how they weren't skimpy with the hollandaise sauce. What I think the most important part of this dish is in fact the hollandaise sauce. Theirs wasn't all that great, not that flavorful, I would of liked it a tad thicker in consistency as well. The eggs poached perfectly, ham was decent and muffins were fine. Their hashbrowns were average and was a nice filler to the plate. Not a bad choice..  Western Omelet: good portion, stuffed with bacon, green bell pepper, onion, tomato and mixed cheese. Also opted for the home fries and white toast. The omelet was straight forward, nothing special but satisfying. The home fries were great, they are seasoned well and come like chunky pieces of potato. An o.k. omelet and great potatoes.  Belgian Waffle: plain, just powdered sugar on top with syrup and butter on the side. Almost every bite was either hard or almost mushy, wasn't cooked evenly but the few inches that was properly pressed was pretty darn good! This should of been at least a 4 star waffle but instead 2 stars should suffice.   Service was good but food just decent"}
{"text":"Had the rancher omelette today. Very delicious and good. Nice clean place and the staff was excellent. I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"Not a good breakfast place. 3 out of 4 of our party did not like their meals.  It definitely seemed like they were just trying to serve food, not quality food. The hash browns were cold, the cheese had no flavor and was rubbery, and the home style potatoes were hard. The only thing that was good was the coffee!"}
{"text":"Breakfast review We are staying at a time share and we're tired of eating at the resort across the street that's always over crowded and resort food that's well you know. Not up to par.  This place will remind you of home.  Friendly staff, healthy portion, clean and priced right."}
{"text":"Mediocrity at it's best. They have a wide range of choices & options however evening seems bland. There is no life in the food. The service has no sense of urgency & gives no personal feel to your visit. IMHO, too expensive for the experience.  On the other hand, my son loves their funny face pancakes & for that reason alone, we will be back."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Portions were small and the food was just eh. My chilaquiles were half the size of the plate and they were soggy and flavorless. I've never been a fan, but they're usually worth it with a coupon, but this time they weren't. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I always look for reviews and yelp has always help me find the right spot for the moment. Went to Las Vegas and decided to stop by at new day cafe. The moment I walked in I was shocked to see what a great atmosphere. There menu has many great selections I ended up with steak sizzling plate with rice and beans. I would recommend this dish to anyone. Lots of delicious flavors and great service."}
{"text":"Friends invited me here for breakfast Saturday morning and I like trying new places.  Was not impressed.  At all.  Save your money and go to IHOP.  Or even Denny's.  Waitress was slow, never refilled my water even when I ASKED, orange juice came in a tiny 8oz cup and was $3 and the hash browns tasted like corn starch.  I had to drown them in ketchup, Tobasco, and pepper to make them barely palatable.  I am really glad I just got something small.  Even still, it took forever to come out and the place wasn't even half full.  Ugh."}
{"text":"Staying at an Airbnb around the corner and wanted a yummy breakfast before we went home. Thankfully we chose New Day Cafe! Breakfast was delicious and service was super quick! Restaurant is clean and nice, if you're in the neighborhood check this place out!"}
{"text":"Lunch or breakfast is always good, we went today and I had the chicken avocado melt, it was good but could have used a little more seasoning on the chicken in my opinion. Jenny was an exceptional wait person, she was friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"I am in love with the new day Café, however I believe they need to schedule more servers to work on busy days. I live right around the corner and I have been here three times now. The food is not amazing, but it is very good for the price. You cant sit a restaurant with a $10 average entry and complain that the food wasn't the best you have ever had. The main reason I go here is because they have a PET FRIENDLY patio, and I can have lunch with my puppy.  I was here on mothers day, I waited 20 minutes to have my drink order taken and no one came, I had to go inside and give the server my order, after ordering food I waited over 30 minutes for it to come out, and I was not checked on once in the mean time. Regardless, my mother and I enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Breakfast Quesadillas and Breakfast sandwich are awesome. The first time I came here I had Chelsea as my server and she was %50 of the reason I returned. I have not had her again since."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a decent breakfast without having to go to somewhere craptastic like denny's or coco's, then this place is great. Lots of seating, quick and friendly service and breakfast tasted good. It's not 5-star amazing, but a great option to have in the neighborhood and I like that they don't load up your entire plate with food."}
{"text":"For such a large kitchen they took quite a long time to get our food. The servers were nice but not so attentive. I'm tired from this weekend, so maybe I'm a bit biased."}
{"text":"I dig cafes and had a BOGO so decided to check this place out on my lunch hour. The food was decent, but then I was sick for two days after. I won't return!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I tried this place for the first time a couple of weeks ago. It's very spacious, comfortable and looks clean. Unfortunately the compliments have to stop at that.... My husband ordered eggs Benedict, he barely finished one of them. The sauce tasted sour and the hash brown were soggy, lacking seasoning and greasy. My avocado bacon cheese omelette looked beautiful but completely lacked flavor too. I only ate about a quarter of it. Our waitress was pleasant but didn't check on us during the meal or didn't inquire if there was a problem with the food when she picked up our almost untouched food. There are too many good breakfast places out there for you to waste your time in this cafe."}
{"text":"A comfortable friendly place to have a well-prepared good tasting breakfast. That's pretty much it. Maybe don't get the coffee. Not the best coffee."}
{"text":"Food was decent and service was good.  We were the only people in the restaurant for dinner which was a bit odd.  I would eat here again if I were in the area but would not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"I have been here about a dozen times and usually the food gets the job done. Nothing special but I at least expect my food to be hot. Today I ordered the Eggs Benedict with home fries. The home fries were cold and under cooked so I did not eat them. I told the waitress and nothing was done. My daughters bacon on her plate was cold too but we did not say anything about that. Then when the check came it was full price for everything. No manager coming by to see what was wrong or anything like that. This experience is not what I spend my hard earned money on and today this restaurant lost a customer. Too bad because it is around the corner from where I live and I left still hungry."}
{"text":"This is good food!  Not great, but good.  There are other breakfast places in town that are much better, but at this one, you likely won't wait to get a seat.  The portions are just right.  I don't like HUGE portions and these are not, but you will not go hungry.  My wife enjoyed it more than I did.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.  Our server was very kind, polite and quick.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood and trying this place out for the first time.  The team working there, along with the owners, Arturo and Theresa, are all very friendly and efficient with their service.  The fact that the owners are present and engaging with customers is always a good sign to me.  As for the most important part, the food, it was surprisingly excellent in quality for a breakfast cafe; on par with what I make for myself at home, minus any effort to cook and clean up!  I had the basics; soft scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, hash browns and an order of banana crepes.  On a side note, the coffee is very good; nice and strong. Looking forward to returning and trying some of their brunch items."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, everything I've gotten has been spot on. When my family is in town, this is the only place they'll go to for breakfast."}
{"text":"Wow just went here by chance with no expectations but came away very satisfied with food, prices and atmosphere. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"We finally got our butts up to try this new place.  We usually go to The Griddle, Memphis BBQ for their brunch, or the brunch at the Republic.  Since we didn't want to spend too much just for breakfast, we opted for A New Day Cafe down the street.  It used to be the location for Las Palmas.  They were not as full as the Griddle, which is nice since there is no wait.  They offer a pretty good selection for breakfast and lunch.  I had their Huevos Rancheros and my partner had the Tommy B. Vegetarian platter.  I always order Huevos Rancheros for breakfast so I was surprised they fry their tortillas and they ask how you want your eggs.  Normally, the tortillas are not fried and the eggs are always sunny side up.  I do have to say though, that their variation is really tasty.  The fried tortillas added another layer of flavor.  I actually didn't use any ketchup.  I usually drench my eggs with ketchup but the food was so flavorful, it didn't need the condiment.  My partner enjoyed his vegetarian omelet.  They also offer Egg Beaters and egg whites for a healthier choice for their egg dishes which is nice for the health conscious.  Overall, the place is a very quaint restaurant to have when you don't want to fight with the lines of IHOP or the Griddle."}
{"text":"This place just opened very near our \"vacation\" home in Anthem Highlands.  We happened to be in town during their opening week so we visited once for breakfast and then a few days later, for lunch.  Breakfast was very plain, my sausage patties were very dry and bland and I'm not quite sure what the hash browns or the home fries were about, but they were clearly not about quality.  But the service was friendly and basically pretty good.  Back for lunch a few days later, tried the tortilla soup - not good, my wife ordered a cold roast beef sandwich, but was served the beef dip instead...I ordered the Manhattan Tuna which was ok, but I guess they were out of sprouts, so the sandwich was not served as described on the menu...and the fries, much like the other potatoes, not good quality.  Apart from the snafu on my wife's order, the service was quite good.  Something we found notable was that during our two visits we never saw any sort of management figure present.  This isn't to say there wasn't one on property at those times, we just never saw such a person on the floor...and this during their opening week.  If I'm opening that store, I am present and very visible.  Hopefully they will improve over time, because we'd really like to have a family coffee shop type concept so convenient to our home.  We'll try them again when we go over in October, hopefully I'll be able to revise this review to something that gives them much higher marks."}
{"text":"I walked in the place, and I felt like I was having breakfast at a relatives house. It's in a really nice area.. guess I expected more from the decor?  We talked in a grabbed a table at the back, which had no place settings. The service was fast and polite.   I ordered a power omelet, which has egg white, turkey bacon and spinach. It was pretty tasty, but I am positive I can recreate the omelet at home.   I do like the fact that you can customize your sides. My omelet came with cottage cheese, but they allow you to choose fruit or french fries.   I think the total was around $9 for my item, which is guess is comparable to IHOP or Denny's, but you get more food at those places.  I personally would pass on this one but if you have a coupon, go for it!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood place, seems like and pop shop (which I love to support). Good good, good service. If I ever have an issue it's fixed with a smile. Good locals place."}
{"text":"Food was average.  Not bad but nothing special.  Hard to impress for breakfast.  Service.. again average.  The whole place is just average.  I wouldn't make a point to go there again but might stop in to give another try."}
{"text":"A new breakfast place in a location that could really need one, i mean lets try it!  My break fast today was not good, i had an egg white omelet with spinach and bacon and while it was just uneventful at best,as a matter of fact the sliced tomatoes on the side was the best, we were a group of 3 and the 2 other had similar poor experience, little cubed potatoes were half cooked and basically cold inside, how hard is it to open a bag from the freezer and make sure they are fully cooked?  Overall this was so poor that we won't be back, the cafe will be a slow learner just because it will be getting a lot of business from the immediate surrounding area.  The one reason for the one star is because the waitress was really sweet, regardless of the fact that when we complained it went from in one ear and out of the other she was sweet, and i believe she is just getting overwhelmed by complaints from a piss poor kitchen operation.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Here for the 1st time and everything was great! Good old fashioned American food. I had a patty melt which tasted like a patty melt should...and the didn't skimp on the onions. My wife ordered the breakfast combo. The pancakes were moist and fluffy and the eggs were cooked the way we ask over medium (sad that isn't the norm at most places). So give them a try if your nearby."}
{"text":"Good service, good food. Will be back.  Great place close to home. Prices reasonable. Menu is large, and varied.   Very happy."}
{"text":"Great place. Fast friendly service. Buffalo chicken wrap was perfect, fries were nice and crispy, tortilla soup was good too."}
{"text":"This place is real good for breakfast. I've mainly tried their omelette entrees which come with hash brown and toast. Service is great and people are real friendly."}
{"text":"I love it here. It's the only place you can come and it tastes like someone cooked my breakfast in a kitchen. Like a home cooked meal not a commercial kitchen. The food is very simple, won't knock your socks off but that's why I come here. As a mom who is always having to cook for someone else this feels like a real meal, not a restaurant meal which I love."}
{"text":"Service and food was good for the price.  They weren't very busy, so I was served my breakfast rather quickly."}
{"text":"So happy we have a decent breakfast place close to our house now. Tried it this morning and it was good. Great variety on the menu, affordable priced, not wait at 9am!  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try this place out for Breakfast.   We were greeted immediately by the hostess and seated. They have a kids menu which is great at any breakfast place. However, I ordered lunch.   Simple food on the menus. I ordered the BLT with a cup of tortilla soup.  The soup was tasty.. Right amount of spice, filled with chicken, vegetables including avocado, cheese & tortilla strips.  The BLT, and you can go wrong with this, but not here. Bread toasted nicely, plenty of bacon, lettuce and tomato and just enough mayonaisse to make it moist.   One of my girls had eggs, bacon & hashbrowns, by the looks of her clean plate, she liked it. The other one had pancakes & bacon.   The food was all served hot, reasonably priced and the service was great.   If you are looking for atmosphere, this is not the place. It is very clean, however there is not much to the decor. Red booths, black chairs & tables and crystal pendant lights.  They may want to rethink the green curtains and neon beer signs. Doesn't really add much to the place."}
{"text":"Ordered the Veggie Wrap and it came with chicken tortilla soup. It was fantastic."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting New Day Cafe. It has ample parking .The menu has a variety of items to choose from. I had the crepe combo with strawberry/blueberrys , eggs and turkey sausage. The crepes were very small and not cooked enough. Too much cream cheese on the inside that took away from the delicate texture and taste of the crepes. My husband had the Ranchero 3 egg omelet with home fries and toast. He requested that onions and bell peppers be added to the home fries for flavor inhancement. He enjoyed his omlet. The service was great. Would not put this on my top 5 eateries. Might return if I'm in the area with a Groupon discount.  Paid 7 dollars and was discounted $15.00. Not bad!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to order French fries for my toddler, we were eating at subway close by. Little cafe, home feeling other customers food looked great. Took a menu and will be back to dine in. Btw the fries were good too."}
{"text":"The service is always amazing! Something for everyone on the menu. They even have a whole section just for people that like to stay healthy and work out. The fruit is very fresh and they actually have really good coffee. And you have to try their cinnamon rolls! So warm and gooey!"}
{"text":"If I had written this the first time I went to ND I would have given it 5 stars....went back and had the same thing...horrible....tried again and it was still bad....every time I was there for lunch....maybe breakfast is better...but J's cafe is always good for breakfast and it is very close by."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast spot (good locals spot)! We always order one of their healthy omelettes. We have had lunch here too and have to say their sandwiches are quite tasty! There are televisions and they serve alcohol too (win win!) We always feel welcomed and are provided great service! **FYI- Just found out they no longer serve dinner."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, usually get eggs, potatoes, bacon, and toast. Everything is cooked to order just right. Service is a bit slow and the food takes a while to be served. Not a good idea if you're in a hurry. It's a tiny bit overpriced by a dollar I would say. Not bad, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  Creative menu with the traditional breakfast items also included.  Not fancy or full of itself like many of the other places.  Reasonable prices and good coffee. Been here several times. Always consistent."}
{"text":"First time visit was great.  Service was promo and very friendly. I ordered the New Day Combo and it was wonderful. Now that I've  been here, I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"It was a yummy lunch.....WE had the Tuna Manhatten and it was very good. Nice portion size and a reasonable value."}
{"text":"Fantastic for brunch! I had the spinach crepe. Service was good. Nice atmosphere. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service is fantastic. Our server was wonderful and very friendly.   I got the Marathon Omelette which was good! Egg whites, spinach, artichoke, tomato, feta. I liked that there wasn't an overwhelming amount of cheese, and all the ingredients tasted good together.   My husband got the Ortega Chile melt, and he said it was real good! Perfect size, not greasy or too heavy, a perfect lunch portion.   The sides were not very good. I love me some hasbrowns, and these seemed like they were dry, flattened too much on the griddle and didn't have much of a taste. Some of my husband's fries were good and others just so-so.   So the food was a 3 star rating and the service was 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm always pleased with New day, very consistent food. The coffee is not watered down and usually you get in with out a waiting. The Mexican dishes are very good."}
{"text":"Sweet and savory brunch sandwiches, yes please!   This New Day Cafe is one of two locations, the other location being in Colorado Springs. This is your everyday, mom and pop breakfast place; pancakes, eggs and multi-layered meat filled Monte Cristo?  Even though I briefly skimmed it, I feel like this is the highlight of the entire menu. The French Toast Breakfast Club is basically a Monte Cristo with the addition of Turkey and a extra layer of French Toast goodness.   Three slices of the French toast, turkey, ham, Swiss cheese, and fried eggs served with a side of strawberry dipping sauce and sprinkled with powdered sugar. I pretty much inhaled this dish, the salty bacon, eggs and turkey was complemented perfectly by the sweet strawberry sauce. The French toast wasn't overly eggy either, lightly toasted and crispy on the edges.   This brunch option was so good that my fiancée gave up on her Eggs Benedict after one taste and I was forced to share, but with four sections of sandwich there was plenty to go around.   Bonus points for putting on the Chargers game for me as I indulged. New Day you have my attention."}
{"text":"It's just mediocre at best. The eggs tasted like they came out of a carton or watered down and not by milk. The linked sausage probably was the best part. The crepes were filled with  what tasted like cheap grocery store cream cheese and were overly sweet. The only fresh fruit was the half cut up strawberry on top. The chorizo burrito was mostly tortilla and the potatoes were dripping with grease. Denny's is more highly recommended than this place. The service was attentive- only good thing about this place.   I was hoping this place could be a neighborhood breakfast joint that would just be a quick walk away, but I will probably never come here again. Just a disappointment."}
{"text":"Chicken strips are awful. Too much breading and cover cooked. Not worth the $$$."}
{"text":"We went back for dinner (not sure if they're still open late). Service and food much better.  No wait for a table because unfortunately the place is empty.  Reasonably priced for nice portions"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there today with the roommate.  We were seated immediatley, the waitress was a trainee, but she did a great job, and the food came out pretty quickly.  I had the French Toast Club...Turkey, ham, swiss, and fried egg, served club sandwich style with French Toast in place of regular toast...my only complaint about the dish was that it needs bacon (then again everything is better with bacon). But it was one of the best breakfast things I have had in a while.  The restaurant is small, they were kind of busy, but the kitchen did a great job getting the food out.  Bonus, you can get a coupon on Restaurant.com for $10 off a $20 purchase, which really takes a big chunk off the bill!!!  I will be going back (plus it's fairly close to where I live)"}
{"text":"Went bk 4 more trying ABC burger, veggie wrap, fajita wrap, & french toast.  All was acceptable but as others have remarked-- on plain side.  Still seems wholesome though & not owned by a corp or chain.  Now they close @3pm everyday."}
{"text":"This is our Sunday morning go-to spot! Servers are great! Food is delicious! Portions are perfect! .....and the prices are reasonable, too! Never been for lunch, but breakfast is fantastic! I only gave it 4 starts because.....is ANYWHERE really 5 stars ??  buon appetite!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late breakfast. Seated quickly. 5 minutes later, server asked for order. With 24 tables/booths it seemed like a lot of servers for such small place. I observed others asked for drinks to start, wondering why I wasn't?  My server did make a suggestion with my order, Gardner Omelet, egg whites, mushroom, bell peppers, tomato and spinach, it comes with fruit or cottage cheese, my server also added sliced tomatoes which were a great idea.  Throwing menus on counter making unnecessary noises? A third person brought my order, tomatoes unripe and tasteless. English muffin not warm enough to melt whipped butter it was served with. The omelet was hot and tasty for the ingredients. Salt pepper to taste spinach appeared to be from frozen, had that overly green appearance as frozen foods do. I made a request of cayenne pepper, but they had none. News alert to restaurant owners and managers, Tabasco and Cholula are not the only sauces, suggestion try Crystal Brand pepper sauce. I learned what I presume was my servers name on my bill, as she died not introduce herself. Decor was inconsistent and need repair/replacement. What this place needs is attention to detail after opening the business. The layout was unusual and not very customer or worker friendly with walls and counters limiting movement."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. They do have nopales (cactus) which I love with scrambled eggs, but as others have noted, the portions are small while the price is similar to other breakfast places (Egg Works, Egg & I, and others...).   Service is \"hit and miss\": sometimes they are okay, and other times negligent. Coffee is pretty good, but it's challenging to get refills without asking. (And even if you do ask, it may not come.) I brought a friend a couple of times and he no longer wants to go there. The servers seem like they are going through the motions. Not rude, just seem kind of out of it or apathetic. Not sure how to describe it.   It's okay for bringing kids, but again the pricing is exorbitant in some cases (like the juice, coffee, and iced tea).   There are better places to go for breakfast for the price and with far better service. Unfortunately, I'll have to drive a bit farther to get to them."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for breakfast. It was our first time. Location is okay and the restaurant looks clean.   Even though two of our orders were messed up, overall our server was friendly. The food was okay. Their egg portions were a bit to small to my liking."}
{"text":"Great local place for breakfast in the Silverado Ranch area. There is never a wait and the service is always very quick. The staff is very nice, especially the hostesses. Food is good and fairly priced."}
{"text":"Been coming here with my family for 2 years. I get the country fried steak every time and it's always great. Good service and the wait time is always resonance if there is one. Highly suggest this restaurant."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service - great food!!! We will be back!!!! Turkey wrap and chicken avocado melt was tasty chicken tortilla soup with cheese was Delish."}
{"text":"I live in Summerlin and decided to try this place..I was disappointed and wont go back.  Food is mediocre-- the Breakfast triple decker is dry and eggs benedict is nothing special. House fries are saggy and there are no coffee refills."}
{"text":"The Boyfriend and I had breakfast here this morning. Food is ok, average at best. Definitely edible, but nothing to really rave about. I ordered the steak & eggs (I'm really on a steak & eggs kick lately) and they were pretty good but the breakfast potatoes and hash brown were both pretty basic and bland. First time I've ever had to add salt/pepper to my potatoes. Honestly this is kind of the kicker for me and even though it's right next to my house it will probably keep me from returning for breakfast. Maybe we'll try lunch next time.   Service was really good though. Staff seems very friendly & our server was nice and we never waited for refills.   The Boyfriend ordered a bloody mary and he said it was good, although a little on the short side."}
{"text":"A mom and pop CLEAN breakfast joint. They could use a decorator but it's nice. They could also use a door in front of the kitchen or at least a fan because it can get a little smokey in the dinning area. But I would definitely recommend this place to non stiff people. Its a delicious warm comfy breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"I absolutely like coming to this place whenever im in town. Great atmosphere in there, the staff is very friendly even though it gets super busy. They pretty much have anything u would want at a brekfast resturant and food tatses original. The pricing is good, way better than ihop or carrows and dennys. They also have a bar area."}
{"text":"Good breakfast selection. I enjoyed the fresh coffee and the customer service. I had the chiliaquiles which I felt had an over abundance of sauce and not enough chips. The husband and I shared a cinnamon roll which was delicious. Nice hole in the wall diner."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! Very good food and good service. The prices are reasonable. I had the breakfast enchiladas and my husband had chilaquiles good portion and good taste"}
{"text":"So, I surveyed family of our party of ten, and here is their overall star rating  Family member 1; 4 stars  Family member 2; 3.5 stars Family member 3; 4 stars Family member 4; 5 stars  Family member 5; 4 stars Family member 6; 3.5 stars  5 stars for big free lot 5 stars for speed of seating  4 stars for service. She had attitude at first 5 stars for HEALTHY OPTIONS *** Plenty of options for egg whites, and spinach ect.   *we had a problem with watery orange juice.  But wasn't a big deal.    Overall, we would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I'm still on the lookout for an amazing place for breakfast. The New Day Cafe is a decent place for breakfast. Better than a Denny's or IHOP but not by much. It was very clean and wasn't very busy. Our waitress was very apparently new and was very timid. She got everything correct! There was just no enthusiasm for her job.   My wife had the French toast with bacon and eggs. She enjoyed her meal and said everything seems to fresh. The eggs were real and the toast was a thick cut with great flavor. I had biscuits and gravy with hash browns. The potatoes were good but bland and a little well done. The biscuits and gravy were nothing special. A mix gravy and frozen biscuits with a cafeteria flavor. The coffee was completely acceptable.   I'm looking for a place who puts forth the effort to make real gravy and real biscuits. Our meal came to a hair under $20. Not too bad but for the price, the quality could be a bit better."}
{"text":"First time coming here and I was impressed. The service was excellent; everyone who worked there was friendly and accommodating. The food was really good as well. I had the new day combo with eggs, bacon, and pancakes. The pancakes were cooked perfectly and very flavorful and the eggs were perfect."}
{"text":"My friend had gotten a coupon off of Restaurant.Com and it is near the expiration date so we decided to come here for lunch last Saturday.  I wanted to eat healthy, so I chose an entree from the healthy section-scrambled eggs with salmon bagel:  The scrambled eggs had cooked diced salmon.  I placed this kinda dry combination on top of half of my bagel with cream cheese.  That is when I realized....Gee, I really like bagel and smoked salmon (bagel and lox..yum), but when the salmon isn't smoked and is cooked, it is not so great...Note to self...Never ever have cooked salmon on cream cheese :(  My friend got the healthy turkey omelet  (hey, we are about to attend hot yoga...gotta eat healthy).  She said it was ok, nothing stood out.  We also ordered each a hot chai.  They used the powder to make this tea, and I will stick to my Oregon Chai with Soy Milk.    The H2O did tasted funny, but lucky me, I always bring my own bottle of water.  The waitress was a bit odd.  She seem kinda out of it.  Don't know...  My friend actually bought 2 of the coupon and had asked if we should go back there the next day to use up the coupon.  I normally would say ok, but I had to back out of this one.  I know I know...I should give it 2 more shots...maybe in a few months, but the next day was wayyyy too soon for me.  I will try this place again, but in the mean time, I shall eat breakfast/brunch elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and soup salad combo. The salad with creamy blue cheese was very fresh. The soup was also very good because everything had fresh ingredients. The new day breakfast combo with French toast was also very good (I ask for no powered sugar).   Value was good. The coffee is not Starbucks, but you can go across the parking lot and get it there! :)  All in all a good place to come for a late breakfast."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food here. Seated right away. Food was served promptly. Filling breakfast for three was $33.24.   I would come back."}
{"text":"Tasteless ... I was thinking to go back for the cheap beer but it might not be worth it... First we were welcomed by a slightly irritated waitress...coffee was cold and the food, I'm sorry, but it was absolutely tasteless... I've order a veggie omelet with spinach mushrooms red pepper...totally dull...  I'm giving it 2 stars for the cheap beer :)"}
{"text":"I have only been there for breakfast and it's great.  The service is fast, the waitress is friendly and the food is priced just right.  I usually go after in opens at 7. Not a lot of people there but by 8 a good crowd has shown up.  The waitress, Nadia, is a one woman serving team.  She usually has 5+ tables to take care of before 8:30   I will definitely go back.  It's perfect because it's close. For a family of 3 it will cost around $25. Pretty good for the area.    It's not 5 stars because it doesn't have a changing table in the bathrooms.  So it's a 4.5"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that we just weren't impressed.  My biggest issue is that my daughter and I both ordered salads and they lettuce was super wet.  They need to invest in a salad spinner or something.  Food was just okay.  I'm sorry.  I wanted to like this place, but I'm just not feeling it."}
{"text":"First time trying out this place and we were not disappointed!  I ordered the California omelette which came with choice of bread, and hash browns or potatoes.  Portions were huge!  My husband ordered the eggs benedict which he did not love the hollandaise sauce on but that was just his opinion, nothing was wrong with the dish, he also ordered a 1/2 order of French toast and our little one ordered chocolate chip pancakes!  For 2.99 you can't beat the kids meal, huge portions!  Everything was yummy and service was absolutely awesome!  Our waitress was super sweet and attentive!  We will definitely be coming back in!"}
{"text":"Second time here. Bad experience the first time, thought maybe a bad day. NOPE!!! Short hair, boy looking, snotty attitude, no personality grouch should be more personable. Second time having her as our server too! Sad to say just ONE person can make or break a decision on where to eat. Highly doubt I'll be coming here again!!"}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day.  We arrived around 12:45.  It took nearly 50 minutes to get our food- eggs and French toast and an omelet.  I asked about 30 minutes in what was taking so long and was told it was taking longer today and our food would be out shortly.  Tables around us had the same problem, parties of 2 and 3 waiting 50, 60, and even 90 minutes for their food.  This is RIDICULOUS!!  On top of that my omelet arrived with cheese when I requested none and the other dish had cold eggs.  I asked to speak with the manager and was told they would go get him.  I told our waitress the omelet had cheese but I would just eat it because I was sure as hell wasn't another 50 minutes for another one.    Miraculously, another omelet arrived without cheese in less than 5 minutes!  It is not like this place was super crowded either.  We sat right down with no wait and there were several empty tables.  Do you think the manager ever came to address my concerns?  NEGATIVE!!  Bad management, no apology, explanation, or even acknowledgement.  If they could have just told us up front it was going to be a longer wait for the food we would have know what to expect, and probably would have gone somewhere else.  Won't come here again!"}
{"text":"finally! a breakfast place that doesnt have just american style breakfast....like ihop.  its hard out here in vegas for a latino to find good local food (non strip) especially other than asian food lol. the menu is great, cheap prices about 20 bucks for 2, and great food. ive been trying every latino dish on here and so far theyre all good. staff is friendly and quick. however ive only been to the location on rainbow but im sure everything is just as good there."}
{"text":"This is our go-to breakfast spot. The selection is wide and the service is always friendly. I've eaten in this building through several of its previous tenants and I must say, I really hope new day cafe stays for a long long time."}
{"text":"When I go out for breakfast, I want a good cup of coffee or hot tea. This has both. They serve Mighty Leaf tea, the best and Lilly coffee, a delicious Italian coffee. The omelets are fresh and never greasy. Always fresh ingredients.  I had fruit instead of potatoes and fruit was fresh and tasty.  They also have tempting southwest style breakfast choices that look wonderful, but I have never tried them. My husband and I visit every time when we are in Vegas.  Oh and about the tea. I often do not order tea on restaurants because the water is not good and I can really tell w/tea. Tea was excellent."}
{"text":"Fantastic little cozy spot. Fantastic food, great service. Been coming here for about a year. Also have patio dining."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Each time we come into New Day Café, we're greeted with happy smiles and excellent tasting food. Awesome restaurant for this area; great addition to the community!"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot for breakfast considering there wasn't too long of a wait for a Saturday morning.  I ordered the usual homemade style breakfast and sadly it was just \"okay\".  I base reviews on 4 factors, taste, presentation, wait times, and service.  Taste - Barely enough to pass, nothing special, but I did finish.  Presentation - Was good enough to eat so it passed.  Wait Times - Seated within a few minutes.  Service - Horrible, was never offered refills or water.  Took forever to take check.  One of the most important parts of making happy customers is the service.  This lost two points because of the long wait to close out the tab."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, fast & easy. The waitresses remember me & all i have to say is \"i want what i usually get\" & she knows what I'm talking about. The price is reasonable. I can have lunch for $10 (including tip). I recommend the breakfast sandwich on sourdough w/ bacon, but everything I've had there is good."}
{"text":"This a comfortable environment with good, if not spectacular food.  They have revolving specials and the new day combo can"}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy were very good.  I always prefer drop biscuits, but these were good.  The gravy was not too salty.  Eileen was the big winner here with the specialty quesadilla which had eggs and chorizo in it with green stuff (ok it was guacamole which I don't eat- LOL) and sour cream on the side.  She said it was among the best chorizo she's had- high praise indeed.  Good coffee too!"}
{"text":"We were seated immediately but with no menus. Hostess said they ran out. Then waited ten minutes while servers passed by seeing we had nothing. Table next to us also hadn't been greeted. When hostess came back over with 2 menus( there was 4 of us) didn't care to get us drinks. I wouldn't give any stars.. Horrible service"}
{"text":"New Day Cafe is a welcomed addition to the Anthem Highlands area. The staff is nice and the food is a bit better than average for a cafe. Although they close at 3:00 p.m there has been times I wished they were open a little later. The prices are fair and service fairly quick."}
{"text":"Beats Denny's for a late breakfast. I stuck with my usual Waffle and a side of fresh fruit. My partner ordered the healthy looking variety breakfast. Lots of food and no complaints. Recommended."}
{"text":"Here in Vegas visiting from Nashville, TN.. came across this establishment and wanted to try something new and that wasn't on the Strip. I had the Pesto Omelet,  and my partner had the Breakfast Quesodilla.. both we delicious.  The Pesto Omelet was full of flavor.. this is a breakfast/lunch spot. So it's best to get in before 3 p.m. I can't truly say this will be one of our faves to visit when we come to Vegas.."}
{"text":"Going back a second time, I have to downgrade the place to two stars. I ordered chilaquiles with red enchilada sauce. Last time I went, I complained that the huevos rancheros were not the way I usually have them, but I will say they did say in the menu that it's only pico they put on it which is weird.  These chilaquiles were just funky. Way way way way way too much cumin. Just swimming in it, it was really bad. The service is okay but it's not enough to make up for the food. I'd say try to stick with maybe omelettes."}
{"text":"Bought a Living Social coupon a while back and decided to go today. I was amazed at how big and spacious the cafe is. The tables aren't close together like most family owned businesses. Environment was nice. Staff was friendly and food was AMAZING!   I ordered the California Omelet (posted pic) and substituted the hash browns and toast for a side of fruit and spinach in my omelet.   My bf ordered Huevos Rancheros (posted pic) and added chorizo into his scrambled egg. It was super tasty with lots of flavor.  Definitely a new go to place for breakfast and the location (silverado and bermuda) is perfect from where we live."}
{"text":"Another breakfast place that is consistent n food and staff are friendly. The prices are normal for breakfast places but if you are planning in advance, they sometimes have certificate available on restaurant.com.   I also like this place because they offer chai lattes!"}
{"text":"This is a great cafe! Awesome place for breakfast and lunch. The food is delicious, they sale alcohol and costumer service is attentive, fast and very friendly. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really good home-style American food... if your home-cooking is super awesome!  I don't really eat breakfast food, however, their entire menu is available while they are open.  I had their California burger... it was excellent.  It was something different from every place else (in a good way). What stepped up the whole dish was the rye bread with parmesan toasted into it... Crisp, tasty, and oh so good!  Their chicken tortilla soup was excellent too."}
{"text":"Great breakfast amazing Bloody Mary. This place is on my bookmark when I come to town. I found it on Yelp and very close to the hotel we were in. The California omlet was great I substituted the bacon with Turkey sausage it was soooo yummy..."}
{"text":"New Day Cafe is a hole in the wall breakfast/lunch spot. Ive been there 3 times now. Its a rather laid back restaurant, when you walk in the waitress tells you to sit where ever you want. Seems rather lazy on their part. Breakfast selection is limited to 2 pages.   On the other hand the food is not bad. They have a french toast club which is very unique and filling. This morning I tried the California Omlete which was great as well.  The reason I only rated it 3 stars is service could be better (we made requests and weren't fulfilled, more napkins? C'mon...) and the toast was on the burnt side and wasn't pre buttered which made it almost as hard as a rock.  But Im sure I'll wind up there again."}
{"text":"Simple, good and great service. I was a little skeptical coming here but they proved me wrong. Food is great with reasonable prices and I like that they close for dinner. Service was 5 stars."}
{"text":"Always fresh food and the waitress staff are really on the ball there service outweighs the  food always smiling,always courteous, and funny thing you never have to ask \"Where is our waitress?\"  You don't get even that at a ritzy place"}
{"text":"Had our pre Zion National Park drive breakfast here and we were more than satisfied. The service was great and the food was delicious. I had the bacon and eggs that came with a hash or fries and toast. My wife had the bacon eggs and pancakes which were huge. We were set for the drive and a few hikes before we were hungry again. Reasonable prices for breakfast so that definely helped during our Utah vacation that we started in Vegas. Unfortunately we were too hungry and in a rush to take pictures. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Alright so it was after school and when my daughter said she was hungry New Day Cafe was just staring me in the face... I got the Tuna Melt that had alfafa sprouts and avocado. The tuna salad is grilled almost like a patty so seeing that was interesting. This sandwich was tasty.... The Mango slushy was very refreshing. My daughter enjoyed her french toast as well... So because this visit was better than the last it earned another star from me!!!!"}
{"text":"Just okay. Nothing special. I ordered the huevos rancheros and I got a tostada with beans and eggs. There was no avocado, salsa, cilantro, etc. It was just very plain. My husband ordered the breakfast burrito and said it was just okay as well. Maybe their pancakes and french toast are better. Might give a second try."}
{"text":"This was my second visit for breakfast.  My husband and I noticed it because it's so close to our house, right off of Silverado Ranch and Maryland.  Both times we really enjoyed our meals.  Definitely members of the clean plate club!  Each time we've gone, my husband ordered the New Day Cafe Special and I had the Huevos Racheros.  We invited my parents to come the second time we went for breakfast.  There was a Yelp check-in offer for a free coffee or latte with order of an entree.  Our waitress had to speak to her manager to find out what the special was valid for....it's only good for 1 drink off of 1 ticket.  Not for 1 drink off of each entree.   The food is really fresh and the coffee is good.  My mom loved her sugar free latte.  My husband really liked his caramel latte.  And I thoroughly enjoyed my chai tea latte! It's a really cute, small restaurant.  Quick, friendly service.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"For a breakfast cafe, I am not sure how most will ever achieve above a 3 star on this system. The food was tasty (had the french toast and a cinnamon roll), although the service was a little slow at times. Good location with ample parking though is always a plus."}
{"text":"only open 7am-3 pm. breakfast and lunch only. good stuff for lunch and breakfast. Nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and get some thing local.."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place when running errands off of the strip. The food is nothing fancy, good diner breakfast food, but everything was delicious and came out very fast. A solid place for breakfast at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Food is not bad for the price. I like the tortilla soup. everything on the menu is available during breakfast and lunch so if you're not in the mood for breakfast you can get whatever you want on the menu...   I compare this to Denny's since it's pretty much the same cooking techniques... nothing fancy here.....   I have been here in the past and have experienced really bad food, but they seem to have fixed it... what happened was I ordered and the omelet tasted like burnt food. almost like if they didn't have the pan washed right...   no experience of that recently though so hopefully they fixed that problem. overall, I'd eat here again.. it's reasonably priced and they have friendly servers."}
{"text":"We've always had pleasant servers, the food is average.  But it's comfortable, never busy so it's not loud.  And they have coupons in the Entertainment Book which we take full advantage of.  Hubby liked the Eggs benedict I got the french toast - moderate/good  We will go back. :)"}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast one day.  My wife asked for her eggs to be dry-scrambled extra dry... they came out regular (still a bit soppy).  We sent them back, they came back slightly browned.  The prices are alright, service was alright.  I wanted to support a local place, but just had better experiences at one of the chain restaurants in the area.  I'd give it a 2.5, but am rounding down."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy in my breakfast craving tummy! This is an unassuming little place tucked in the corner of a strip mall. My fiance and I checked it out one Sunday morning on a whim; we wanted to try a new place. I was a bit nervous that we were attempting to go out for breakfast during prime brunch time, but to our pleasant surprise, this place is huge and was able to accommodate us immediately.   We sat at a quaint little booth next to a window. The first thing I noticed was a deliciously plump cinnamon roll being taken to a table near by...ummm, I'll have one of those please! I'm so glad we ordered it because it was AMAZING!!! You can tell it was freshly baked with some serious love.   I've come to understand that when it comes to ordering entrees, my fiance is way better than me. I can't even tell you what I ordered, but I can share that the Monte Cristo (what he ordered) was pure perfection. I know because I ended up eating all of his instead of my own. One of the many reasons I appreciate him!   All around it was a very nice brunch experience. Relaxing and casual with quick and friendly service. I will certainly be back on a lazy Sunday to get my breakfast craving met."}
{"text":"So good! Healthy choices and not heathy choices ! They have it all :) the egg white spinach omelet is amazing '"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place last weekend. A friend warned me New Day is very \"greasy spoon\". If this is \"greasy spoon\", then I guess we're just not into grease all that much here in Vegasland.  I tried an avocado & mushroom omelette that really hit the spot. It wasn't too heavy, yet it still filled me up just right. The 'shrooms and the eggs were also cooked just right. Again, this was a nice, pleasant surprise.  I'm certainly willing to come back and try New Day again. The spoons may not be very greasy, but they still come in handy here."}
{"text":"I've moved a little farther away, and I don't visit as much as I used to, but I still pop in every couple months for the French Toast Club. It was my favorite breakfast sandwich for a long time, and is still pretty good. But I have noticed the last couple times it started tasting a little bland. Something has gone missing, not sure if it's being seasoned differently, maybe it had more cinnamon before?  Still, I've always had decent service and I still crave the sandwich enough to keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"I really love this place . It's close by and the service is always fast. We never have to wait long for food or drinks. One thing I always order is their ice coffee, it's amazing. I'm a huge coffee fan and it's always good when I come here. The skillets are also super amazing as well. Staff is all friendly and outgoing. They never miss anything ! I come here often and love it!"}
{"text":"Decent place to stop on the way home from Vegas. It's off the strip so wasn't too busy on a Sunday morning. Came here with a group of 8 people so it could be a little difficult i understand. The bus boy brought the food out and didn't know who ordered what so out food sat on a tray for a couple more minutes until our server came out and could do it so that was annoying. I got the western omelette with hash browns well done and the omelette was decent and hot. The hashbrown were still a bit under cooked but I didn't feel like sending them back. It was a decent meal but I wasn't expecting the best anyway. Prices are reasonable also"}
{"text":"We love coming in here!  It's very convenient for us!  Never a long wait.  The food is delicious!  I highly recommend the veggie Benedict it is wonderful!  Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"We came to Vegas for my husbands birthday and ate here for breakfast before heading to the strip, the food was spectacular , not even exaggerating it was like a home cooked meal from momma house . Hahah I loved it my guests and I cleared our entire plates!!! Big ups to NewDay Cafe Were from San Diego!   Keep up the awesome good and nice service sincerely the Moore Family 9.16.17"}
{"text":"Found this place through groupon & thought I'd give it a try. Came here for brunch, the service is good, but the food we got was bland and a little cold. They were pretty busy when we came in but that's no excuse."}
{"text":"Ordered a eggs Benedict here before and today I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. It was delicious. The portion was big so I had to take it home but it was delicious. It comes with a soup or other sides from the list that they let u choose. Pretty good place to go for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Some times we are just looking for something new.  Sometimes I just get lost (so says my wife)... regardless of \"how\" we arrived there,  this place was the perfect destination.  Looking for a quiet lunch off the strip, Yelp! led us here.    We had a suprise in a strip mall.  From the moment we walked in, we new this was a real find.  Immaculately clean, tastefully decorated, and a welcoming staff.  That is the first impression.   But none of that matters if you never want to eat the food.  No worries here!  My meal of freshly made enchiladas with eggs on the side was fantastic!   The homemade green sauce was worthy of 5 stars all on its own.  My wife, still convinced I was lost, enjoyed perfectly cooked eggs with French toast.  I know what you are thinking...  simple breakfast meals get 5 stars... yup.  These folks earn it with every meal the prepare and serve."}
{"text":"I will say this place has good food and great coffee. They have a full bar which is nice for an off the strip breakfast spot, but service is lacking. I had to send back my omelet and when it returned, it still was not what I ordered. When I looked for my server she was either talking to other staff or just standing at the kitchen waiting for food for 5+ minutes at a time. This is not the first time this has happened to me here. It seems that multi tasking skills are sub par, but the food is good when it comes out right."}
{"text":"Never let me down. I love all there Mexican breakfast. The cactus jack is my fave! Everything is really good. Im here alll the time. Convenient location. Nice people abd they serve alcohol and play the games for you sport fans out there. Good prices eveyerthing under ten and they have drink specials!"}
{"text":"Relatively fast and friendly service. Very clean. Food was very good and nice portion sizes for the price.   The Buffalo Chicken wrap was very good and fresh fries. Breakfast quesadilla was filling.  Family friendly restaurant but can get a bit loud at times with all the children and open kitchen. However it does add to the homey feel of the place."}
{"text":"New Day Cafe has consistently produced excellent food, and top notch service. The place is always clean, and it's large and accommodating enough so you rarely have to wait. They have the best coffee I have ever put in my mouth, I believe it's Illy brand, and I just have no complaints at all about the place. I love their California omelette because it already comes with avocado and sour cream on top. I am glad that I live so close, because it has become my go-to breakfast joint. Keep up the great work guys. :)"}
{"text":"Came out here from California and the food was very fresh and really good. I would recommend this place to anyone coming her for a spectacular brunch."}
{"text":"The wife and I were looking to go somewhere new for breakfast... We had driven by this place so many times and never went in... Today, it was exactly what we needed. http://www.newdaycafelv.com/  Cozy place that is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside. It has a nice decor with \"Bar\" style seating in the far back. Very clean. Also, it is refreshing to go somewhere that isn't a chain.  The staff was busy but were quick and friendly. We had our meals within ten minutes  of ordering...  The menu was large and had just about anything you would want for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I had the Ham and Cheese Omelet with Hash Browns and wifey had the South Western Omelet with Country Potatoes. They also had Seattle's Best Coffee (nice touch). Everything was good! We both really enjoyed our meals and it definitely wasn't overpriced.   The New Day is nothing out of the ordinary, but we weren't really looking for anything out of the ordinary =) This is a real nice little Ma and Pa kinda place good for that \"Late Sunday Breakfast\" Cheers!"}
{"text":"...... awesome breakfast grate waitresses  missing you all your staff"}
{"text":"When cafe first opened, we loved coming here. We were really happy about having a new breakfast place. However, what we feared has happened. The food quality has gone down and they have changed recipes. Their original corn beef has use to be good, now they've added bell pepper which totally changes the taste. The tuna melt is now very bland and served with fries that look like they were the remnants from the bottom of frozen bag...meaning they were broken pieces of a potato. The Rachel sandwich use to be really tasty, but now tasteless.  Just too bad. Wish they would have kept up the same food quality they had when they first opened. I have also noticed that it has not been as busy as it used to be."}
{"text":"To me one of the most important things about a restaurant is the employees. And New Day Cafe is at the top of the list. When my favorite waitress left Twin Peaks I quit going there. When I followed her to New Day, she says stalking, I say following, (Tomato/Tomoto)  it became clear that I had found a haven of great foods. (and people). Now I will admit, I am the kind of guy that has one meal I get in each of the restaurants I visit. On the other hand my wife rarely gets the same thing twice and tries everything on the menu over time. New Day is my place for the Ortega Beef melt. Now it's true, I thought Ortega was the name of a foreign car, as in Toyota Ortega or something, but it turns out it is a mild pepper and this sandwich is fantastic. My wife has ordered about a dozen different things and loved everything but the Fish and chips and she already has a favorite place for those so all  is good. If you live in South Henderson and have not tried breakfast or lunch at New Day Cafe, you're missing a great place to eat. Try it, you won't regret it!!    Yelp is showing this Review as if I had written it about the one in Las Vegas that is now closed. (Actually moved to a new location I think.) I was talking about the one in Henderson on Bicentennial in the Albertson's   Plaza."}
{"text":"This is THE great American breakfast restaurant. Great food, friendly service, nice atmosphere, GREAT garden burgers. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"We went here on Labor day 2014. We walk in and there's at least 20 open tables, (no lie) and they tell us there's a 15 minute wait. and they have at least 3 other parties standing around waiting for a table. I asked, \"why would you make us wait if you have at least 20 open tables?\" The hostess replied, \"well we have a few large parties so, we're not seating.\"  Let me tell you, I've been here before and the food is just ok. Basic diner style food, so they should be doing everything they can to fill those empty tables, especially in a competitive restaurant market. Very disappointed, won't be going back. Too many better choices to waste my time here."}
{"text":"I fixed a co workers car the other day and she bought me lunch. I chose the best lunch one could have, breakfast. Their Denver omelette was pretty awesome and the hash browns were crispy and awesome. We made an order for 8 and picked it up. It was ready a few minutes before promised and still warm once we got back to work. If I lived closer I would probably make a brunch of it."}
{"text":"For what it is (a decent, budget-friendly breakfast), you can't go wrong. This is a tried-and-true model, and as long as you the customer don't go veering off the tracks (no crab omelette), you'll be OK. Stick to the basics here: bacon, eggs, ham, potatoes, and you'll find any number of combinations to fill you up without breaking the bank.  As a bonus, they also serve booze! So get yourself a Sunday bloody Mary if you must.  Our server was attentive, and the location was clean. On top of decent eats, and an early opening time, you can't beat that."}
{"text":"Good location for the inspirada / anthem crowd. Service was good. Food left a little bit to be desired. Ordered Crepes. They were all lost not very much filling. Ordered a side of fruit and it was literally paper thin slices laid out on lettuce to make it look like it was more. Waitress said it was to make it look cute. In a pinch it's a good spot but it's better to drive down the road to Egg Works."}
{"text":"This is a large, clean and bright coffee shop that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.  We each ordered eggs Benedict that came with a choice of home fries (my wife) or hash browns (me). The eggs were cooked \"easy over\" as requested, but we thought the English muffin could have benefited from a little more time in the toaster.  Also, the Hollandaise sauce was a little out-off-balance due to an excess of lemon juice."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the worst restaurant in the Silverado Ranch area! I would give it negative five stars if I could. I have called in numerous phone orders for a simple dish of biscuits and gravy and they always say 10 to 15 minutes your order will be ready. but as you can see by me writing this bad review that again my order was not ready and I could not wait for it because I had to get back to work. The customer service is the worst I have ever experienced in my life...... If you would like to get an actual meal in a timely fashion DO NOT EAT HERE.... Horrible,horrible,horrible........"}
{"text":"My husband and I go to this place at least once a week for breakfast and occasionally we make it there for lunch.   Food: The food is pretty good. We usually get an omelet or eggs and bacon. We don't eat carbs so we do fruit with our meals. They have a lot of healthy options and we like that. They never have a problem tailoring something to fit our needs. The staff is very accommodating. The food is cooked well and never greasy. The fruit is fresh and the coffee is good.   Staff: We go here mostly because of Stephanie! She is an amazing waitress, always remember what we order and is friendly and fast! The hostess and some of the other waitstaff are also very nice. The cooks are great when we see them and always make things exactly as we want them. There is one waitress who isn't very nice and we avoid her but it's like that everywhere.   Cleanliness: This place is always clean and bright. Dishes and silverware are clean as are the tables and seats. Bathrooms are immaculate.   Price: it's not that cheap but it's not overly expensive either. If you're looking for a 5 dollar greasy plate, this isn't your place. They use high quality ingredients and fresh fruit and veggies though so I'm willing to pay a little more for that!   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here around 10am on a Saturday. Only a few tables being used. Sat down and ordered drinks..the coffee is very good.. I went with a waffle and hubby tried the burger & fries. Service was ok. My waffle was brought out about 4 minutes before the burger which was odd. It was nice and fluffy but nothing amazing. Hubby said burger was ok. I snuck a few fries and they were fresh and crisp. It's a nice place but truthfully we are regulars @ The Griddle so we most likely won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We love having a breakfast place so near by. Breakfast was exactly as ordered. Service was wonderful. Bill was itemized properly. We will be back for sure. Not sure if others visited too soon, but we felt welcomed, properly served and very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Food is alright, price is alright. service is alright didnt even bother to fill us water even there were no one at that time.."}
{"text":"Great. Amy was really great. Very friendly. I had the california omelette. I recommend it. Would come here again."}
{"text":"So this is my third time here and I can say that I am pleased. Each time I have came it has been slow allowing me to be seated and served right away. Their food is pretty standard for breakfast but their service is exceptional! Each time I have been here I have had the same server, I believe her name is Chelsea. She is always very attentive and comes over to check on me just the right amount of times. My coffee and water is never low! She is always working hard and is very sweet! For this reason it has became my post grave shift breakfast place. It's a comfortable casual environment, perfect for reading a book and enjoying a nice meal. :)"}
{"text":"We love coming here. My husband loves the breakfast. I prefer the lunch.  The staff is always friendly and it's comfy inside. They're only open till lunch time so get here early.."}
{"text":"Decent place for breakfast, with a good variety.  Service was super:  Waitress was attentive, friendly, and prompt.  We were seated immediately in a comfortable booth.  Ambience:  Was diner style.  Could eat at the counter, bootth, table, or outside.  Food:  Here's where they dropped a star or two. Original order was one of the healthy choices:  bacon, spinach omelet with egg whites, toast, and cottage cheese.  The bacon was a little mushy, which when you cook with just the egg white, you gotta put the bcon in last.   Flavor was decent.  A little salty. This is where they got it wrong.  I ordered the eggs Benedict florentine  special for the day.  looked beautiful, and the eggs looked to be perfectly cooked.  I didn't get that far.  Dipped my fork into the 'hollendaise' which did appear to be a little gummy.  Tasted it.  Could go no further.  I am not sure what it really was...but definitely not hollendaise.  Pasty yellow gravy...drank a sip of coffee to get rid of the taste.  I never send food back....ever.  I usually change my mindset....settle for average, and eat it.  This was a first.  And the waitress was so nice about the whole thing.  Brought back the menu, and took my plate away.  On the re-order they earned back a star to bring to 3.  The two eggs were perfectly cooked over easy, and the ham steak was awesome.  Hand cut, thick steak, that wasn't overly salty.  I should have stuck with the basics at a diner-type location.  Lesson learned.  Coffee was pretty strong....not bad or bitter, just strong.  Solid non-IHOP breakfast, locally owned, and got super crowded....so locals like their food."}
{"text":"I feel like I lost half of my day being at this place.  We waited 32 minutes for an egg white omelette and a country fried steak.  In the time that we waited one guy sitting across from us walked out from waiting so long and the people sitting behind me started complaining.  It wasn't even busy.  There were a lot of empty tables.  The server moved very slowly and was in no rush to keep her tables happy.. or at least informed since she never really came around except to take our order and bring us our food.  When the food came my EGG WHITE omelette was light yellow.  The server said \"its because of the artichokes.\"  Really?!?  That's a first!  I never had artichokes that colored my egg whites before...must be a type of artichoke I've never had before The omelette itself lacked flavor.  The country fried steak lacked flavor and the over medium eggs we ordered needed to be a little more cooked as the whites resembled clear slime just below the surface.  Overall...even with our Groupon...our experience was enough to regret our time there and to positively decide to never return."}
{"text":"Wow the service is great.  Friendly and honest.  The food is not the best.  All pre-made.  Nice place of you want something quick and easy."}
{"text":"Wow u can have ur Cracker Barrel, this place is off the hook. I used to do Mr Mamma but once they got to big for themselves I found New Day and so glad I did. Good 2nd to none coffee on point and service spot on. Will return soon and often."}
{"text":"I am a big breakfast person... and for the price and the quality of food i would just say its okay. Nothing really stands out.. I pretty much eat there because it is close to my house..The food isnt horrible or anything, and the servers are all nice...i just prefer a few other places to this one."}
{"text":"Great burger!! Casual, comfortable atmosphere. Good go to for a relatively quick meal."}
{"text":"Upon arriving on Father's Day understanding there would be a wait, no problem. We usually come here very often because it's  close not bad food needs an uplift to the menu items new variety, but when we were seated  our waitress who we know from the old location was not pleasant seemed like she could care  less about her customers. We ordered the Tommy B omelette and 2 eggs benedicts. We hasked for crispy bacon in pmace of ham easy on the sauce. Well the headache begins no follow up service on coffee refills the bacon was not crispy sent back the eggs were nearly raw like a rush job and slothered in sauce. It seemed like they never remade the breakfast but added even more sauce to hide the fact. After being in the resturant for almost 1.5 hours sitting waiting on our order while other tables seated after us finished eating and left I think they lost our order in the shuffle and did not know until we said something then rushed the food out. Eggs uncooked fee liking like getting sick ? When we asked for the manager our server sent over another server guess she did not want to deal with us anymore she said he stepped out. She said we did not have to pay for the breakfast my husband said no we are not we are leaving  she expected us to eat the raw eggs just because she said we did not have to pay for it. Can you  believe this? I was SHOCKED!!!!!  Eat under cooked eggs because it's free ate you crazy what kind of answer was that? We will NOT be going back there. We went to another establishment on Eastern Ave And the food was quality service was good and the food had much better taste and the quality of the food was so much better. Higher standards. NEW DAY CAFE IS OLD SUBSTANDARD FOOD AND SEFVICE GO ELSEWHERE !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch when it opened about 6 months ago or so got \"bar\" food their menu is right out of any local gaming bar but 20% higher prices decided not to go back. Went back this weekend for breakfast thinking who could screw up breakfast? This place can. Ordered eggs Benedict . The \"hollandaise \" sauce was hideous. Not even good enough to say it came out of a can. Hash browns were mashed flat literally like a pancake and came as one solid piece. Wife ordered eggs and bacon. Server didn't ask how she wanted eggs they just made them scrambled without asking. When they arrived she saw they were scrambled and asked if they had any additives and server said yes - milk. Wife is lactose intolerant so sent them back asking for just eggs server asked \"you mean fried eggs? Wife said yes. She then brought her two eggs that had been broken onto a griddle and fried hard. Not edible. We' d had enough. Paid our bill and left most of the garbage ( food) uneaten. Eat at this terrible place at your own risk. Servers with attitude , high prices for what they offer and just simply awful food!"}
{"text":"I've been here about five times since it has opened and they serve up a mean eggs benedict. It's located near my house so it's convenient since I do not have to drive far. I have yet to try anything else on their menu, but the eggs benedict keeps me coming back for more =]."}
{"text":"One piece of advice: SPLURGE ON CALORIES AND GET COUNTRY FRIED STEAK AND EGGS!!!!  I usually can't finish an entire breakfast plate no matter where we go, but on this sweet day I cleaned my plate and wanted more!!  The country fried steak had a nice light and crisp breading on the outside but was tender and so flavorful underneath the breading.  The gravy was was just the right consistency of thickness and the flavor was on POINT!  It came with two over-easy eggs cooked to perfection, which I happily dipped my perfect toasted wheat bread into.    I love that there is never a wait no matter what day or time you show up.   The servers are really nice and they take your order on an iphone.  At first I was like, \"Is she TEXTING while taking our order!?? WTH!!\"  but no, she was just being technologically savvy.  The food came out so fast.  You ALL know that the wait for breakfast seems to be SO much longer than the wait for any other meal, so it is quite a huge plus that the food is cooked quickly and served quicky here.  This is one of my favorite breakfast spots.  Great food, nice staff, quick service, relaxing atmosphere, clean restaurant...what more could you want?"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of hype about this place, but cannot say it lived up to the hype.  The service was horrible and food just ok."}
{"text":"Love this place! Staff is great, food is great. Nice, clean, simple. It's family friendly and priced right too. It's a easy neighborhood family restaurant, who if you go enough, is the kind of place who remembers your order from last time and what you like to drink. Personalized service which is tough to find in Vegas."}
{"text":"We've been driving by New Day Cafe every once in awhile and it doesn't hurt when you see ads for them in the newspaper too.  We finally got around to brunch here on a Saturday and it was nice to see this neighborhood cafe more than half filled with customers this afternoon.  Their menu is extensive with a wide range from breakfast items to sandwiches, salads, burgers, and wraps.  They also offer a kids' menu for 12 and under.  The BF went for the \"Cactus Jack Omelet, made with nopalitos, chorizo, salsa, and monterrey jack cheese\" for $8.29.  It also came with hash browns or home potatoes.  It was a decent size order, but he thought it would be bigger.  I went for one of their breakfast wraps, \"Chorizo, eggs, green chiles, potatoes, and cheese, made with two scrambled eggs in a flour tortilla and served with sliced tomatoes or cottage cheese for $6.99.  With a little hot sauce, it's your breakfast burrito.  It needed a bit more green action inside though.  Overall, our breakfast items were okay.  They satisfied our breakfast cravings, and it was nice to try out a new neighborhood restaurant.  Service was okay, they could learn to work better as a team instead.  (We noticed other orders sitting in the window ready to be brought out to the customers, but the other waitresses didn't help with those.)  They do offer some cool jams and jellies for your bread, like apple jelly and peach jam.    (Pics of our brunch are in the business profile!)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and ordered the chicken and avocado sandwich. I should have brought a magnifying glass to see the small chicken breast that was no more than 1/16 inch thick. The avocado was 2 very small [pieces which was not enough for the sandwich. The cheese was not melted on the chicken, but on the bread and was not enough as it covered only 1/2 of it. The french fries were soggy.  Inside the restaurant was hot, I guess they are trying to save on the A/C since the lunch crowd was not here. One of the waitresses arrived at 12:00 and proceeded to get a plate of food and sit down and eat it in the restaurant. Who owns this place?  I will not be back.  I will be surprised to see this restaurant stay in business starting next year."}
{"text":"This is a very nice, very clean restaurant with friendly people working there. Service was exceptional. Food was very good. This area needed a breakfast/lunch place and this place fits the bill. I just wish people around here would give it a chance and quit being so critical and judgmental. Back home in the Bay Area we had a little cafe nearby our house and the food was just as good and the line was out the door on the weekends with a long wait. I believe in supporting your local small businesses. Good job New Day Cafe! We will be back."}
{"text":"Im surprised that this place is even open!!! Our first visit we were celebrating our daughters birthday the place was empty and the food was mediocre. Our server had said maybe 4 words to us the whole time never offerd any type of specials or walk us thru the menu. She did not at anytime check on us and after we sang happy birthday to our daughter she never even offerd any birthday deserts or even botherd to check on us... So today we went back to try again, boy that was a dumb idea!!!! Today it was daughter and I and i just looking for some lunch and we decided to give it a try again. We where sat with the same server from the first time we orders waters and a sprite and i orderd an iced coffee, i sent the coffee back because it tasted like it was 8 days old, again no personality from the server and i even apologized for her to have to take the coffee back, my daughter ordered the french toast and i orderd the tortilla soup. Our server shows up and slaps everthing on the table and walks away!!!! Guess what! The soup was cold and when i finally  got her to come back over to our table she was aggravated that i did not want my cold soup!!! So i apologized again to her (should have been the other way around! !!!!) And i told her to please put in an order of steak and eggs med rare for me. While my daughter eats alone our server has disappeared and never checked on us. We waited for about 30 minutes with out drink refills and i finally flaged another person down to refill our waters.. guess who finally shows up? our server!! She slaps my steak and eggs down in front of me and walks away again... after waiting for 25 more minutes for her to return so i can tell her that i asked for med rare and not well done my daughter and I get up and walk to the counter and request for a manager. The manager ends up being our server!!!!!!! How... great.... yay!!! Had an attitude problem when I told her that I'm not paying for this entire experience except for the one thing we actually ate which was the French toast, she then insisted with an attitude oh it's okay I'll void the whole check! She then gave me an attitude when I told her no I would like to pay for the food that my daughter and I ate... she then rolled her eyes and walked away, the girl that was cashing us out at the podium was staring at me like I was speaking in ancient alien hieroglyphics, and was completely incompetent of not knowing what to do. I said you can ring me in for the French toast I would like to pay for that please since we did eat that and enjoyed it... after the hostess regains Consciousness and swipes my credit card for the French toast the manager comes over and has the audacity to yell at the Dazed and Confused creature for swiping me for the French toast. I again get into an argument with the manager and insisted that I will pay for the food we ate! we will never ever return to this establishment and that manager slash server slash whatever has the personality of a wet mop!!!!!!! If i could i would take away the only star"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would let's start off me and my boyfriend walked in right away we got seated (was very surprised and happy) we sit at the table for 20 minutes with no menus even finally someone comes to take our order and we tell her we have not even seen the menus so she brings us those (15 minutes later) so we quickly decide and what we want and it comes out fast can't complain there the ham on my sandwich seems like they went across to Albertsons and bought those .70 cents packages of thin ham food wasn't even that great and the service sucked. I would recommend not checking this place out if you live in anthem and just make the little bit extra drive to somewhere outside of anthem."}
{"text":"Okay so let's talk about eggs! Possibly my favorite meal of the day, breakfast. I moved from anthem to inspirada recently and living near a breakfast restaurant I needed to go in. I LOVED crepes Florentine and the eggs Benedict, I would suggest either with crispy hash browns, my partner would suggest the chicken avocado melt for lunch! The pricing is very fair!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning and we are absolutely coming back tomorrow!!! The food here is soooo good! Eggs taste like real eggs just like everything else!  I had a veggie wrap. I don't know how they made the veggie patty but it was so good and juicy! My daughter had scrambled eggs w onions, green peppers, and avocado. She is 14mo old and ate almost everything.  My husband had an omelette and he too was impressed and satisfied.  On top of all the good food, the service was amazing and the price!!!! The price!!! Soooo looooowww!! $25 for 3 dishes with drinks??? And we went yesterday at ihop($40)... I wish we found this place sooner."}
{"text":"Okay so this place I have mixed feelings about. The food is decent and I have been here about three times, twice the service has been mediocre at best, but one time the server was fantastic. I will start with the bad and end with the good. The bad is this, they appear to use rotten potatoes when making their hashbrowns. Two of the times I was there the shredded hashbrowns had nasty tasting black spots all over them. Also in one of these same visits, the chopped potatoes were not cooked thoroughly and so some of them were hard. The table next to us had the very same issue. What made these visits worse was the server who seemed that anything we asked of her was an imposition. She would sigh and when we told her about the potato issue there was just an \"oh sorry\" as she took away the plate. The food was overcooked and tough and not very good either in these visits.  Now the good, one time I came by here for breakfast and there was different server, this was a much different experience. The food was very good, and the server was extremely nice. We had a small issue and she fixed it immediately and truly acted like she cared about the customer service.  In all, if I HAD to I would stop back in here if it were my only option, but I cannot highly recommend it. I hope the owners see this and look at the situation, this could be a neat little restaurant if they could do things the way the did on the good visit at all times."}
{"text":"I had the waffle/ eggs/bacon plate. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good. Just middle of the road. The service was good not great. My wife had the same  review(I think she had the eggs Benedict)."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like it but food was just ok.    Chicken in breakfast quesadilla was overcooked and cubed but eggs were good. Everything else was so-so. But great staff and hopefully food quality and menu improves since location is in dire need of this kind of place and should thrive otherwise.  Will give it another try however."}
{"text":"Great customer service from Jenny! Fast delivery of our food and quiet atmosphere. Prices aren't bad either. We shared a New Day combo with an extra side of bacon (need that protein!) and my wife had coffee; came to about $15. Plus they have a bar menu with Mimosas, beer, Bloody Mary's and wine! Right now they are also offering a Pumpkin Spice Bailey's Coffee! I didn't get to try it (dietary stuff) but it sounds bomb! I think we'll become regulars here."}
{"text":"My breakfast hasbrowns tasted like rotten meat.  They changed them for home fries.  The home fries tasted like cardboard. They have no imagination and the food is bland.  Service is great but food is not good at all.  Like the other person below said.... Beach Cafe is a lot better."}
{"text":"Excellent! live nearby and have driven by many times. Glad I finally came in - great service, great food!! Will definitely be back.."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood place to get breakfast.  The service is top notch, and the servers couldn't be more friendly.  Great place for a family, as it isn't very loud.  You could also grab a cocktail with breakfast here which is nice, without all the rowdyness of a local bar.     The only thing that stops me from rating this place 5 instead of a 4 is the use of too many frozen ingredients. It seems like most of the meat-based items (With the exception of the turkey) come from the freezer."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot for breakfast. The restaurant is clean and all the staff is friendly. I had the new day combo which was really good eggs, bacon, french toast. Just enough food. The food is always cooked great!!"}
{"text":"Bloody Mary for $5 and it's tasty?! Sold! Perfectly spicy just how I like so if you don't like them spicy I'd ask since they didn't specify a preference. Ordered the TBA melt - turkey, bacon, avocado = yumm w/a side of fries! For a seemingly ordinary sandwich they managed to make it extraordinary. Lucky for me this is a block away from me so I'll be coming back on the weekends with my boyfriend."}
{"text":"Serious 30 min... Still wasn't seated... They seated 5 groups of  2-3  people and we were still waiting... We decided to leave and go to Beach Cafe... So much better... The waitress is nice and so the waitress was amazing... So glad we ate here instead of this place and there was no wait for a group of 5"}
{"text":"I really like this place! We ordered a club sandwich and a Philly cheesesteak  and both were really yummy. The only thing I wish they had was another soup choice! They only have Chicken Tortilla soup. The prices are a little more than I'd expect to pay but honestly it was so yummy that won't deter me from coming back!"}
{"text":"Good basic breakfast, nothing fancy but lots of variety for many appetites."}
{"text":"This place has descent breakfast.  I especially liked the healthy breakfast selection which included omelets made with egg whites.   Friendly staff, descent prices, kid friendly, clean, casual setting."}
{"text":"Great food & prices! We come here at least 5 times a week. The girls are always so friendly especially Blanca & Stephanie.The food is always great. It's family owned so it's a great hidden spot only locals know about. Come in & try it out, we never leave dissapointed! They also allow dogs on the patio so Our bulldog Stella loves it too!   This location is on Silverado & Bermuda, in the fresh & easy parking lot right next to Citi Bank :)"}
{"text":"My trip here has inspired me to join yelp. I've been here a few times and it was one of mynfavorite places, but the other day after walking in the girl at the cash register told us to sit anywhere we like. Only about 7 tables were being occupied, wasn't busy, we headed towards a booth about half way there a waitress cut us off and for some reason pointed us towards a table, we mentioned we preferred a booth and sat down. She left some menus and walked away. She didn't ask if we wanted any drinks and just walked away. We waited about 4 minutes just watching the staff walk around before finally getting up to leave, the only person that noticed was the bus boy who shot a look around to see where the waitress was....she wasn't paying attention. Perfect ending was the under new management sign on the building....new management seems to be worse!"}

{"text":"**Summary**        - Prices - Their prices are pretty steep for the amount and quality you get. Their New Day Combo has 2 bacon strips, 2 eggs, and a tasteless french toast for $7.99. Other places you can get that plus hash browns for $5.        - Taste - The only redeemable thing about the entire meal was that the breakfast sandwich itself was pretty good. This is the first breakfast place I've seen that screwed up seasoned potatoes.        - Lag - It was decently packed when we got in and didn't get out food for about 40 minutes.        - Service - The waitress came over three times during my entire visit there. Once to take orders, another to return with the food, and lastly to drop off the check. I didn't expect much service, but that's just ridiculous. I didn't even get a refill on my drink. **Ordered**        - $7.99 Breakfast Sandwich - Bagel sandwich was pretty good, but the seasoned potatoes weren't seasoned well and undercooked (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ea04rGA3H-ZqY1nHLpI2FQ?select=Sp5Q6ZCE92FTaTcT47WCKg).        - $7.99 New Day Combo - You get very little for what they call their signature combo. The french toast was lacking flavor and was simply sub par (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ea04rGA3H-ZqY1nHLpI2FQ?select=lRBRvqm2oKC8fwYMaEBPaQ). **Recommendations**        - I would definitely not recommend this place. Your local IHOP would have better food and at lower prices. I would of given this place a one star had it not been for the bagel sandwich."}
{"text":"New day is a favorite of ours. Friendly staff, good food. Great little place near my house to get breakfast."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on our lunch break and it was fairly empty - so we thought great! It should be fast as we only had a hour.  Long story short....The service was very slow.....and mediocre.....I ordered the BLT and chicken tortilla soup....the soup tasted like it was from a can and they just added their ingredients to make it their own...and how can you mess up a BLT??  Well there was something in there that was sour...and the bacon was hard ...tough ..and chewy...no bueno....If they had asked how the food was...i for sure would have mentioned it as it could have been spoiled mayo...tomato...or lettuce....but they never asked.....so I never told.... I left a disappointed ...dissatisfied ...non returning customer."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to their Silverado Ranch location, but because Katrina M. has a groupon for this location we stopped by for brunch before she had to work.  When we entered, the restaurant was steady but not busy. We sat down at the booth the waitress just cleaned off and were greeted with menus. Wanting to avoid any hassles we showed the coupon and got that out of the way. From that point on, it did not feel like we were top priority, but we were not ignored completely either. Katrina M. was in the mood for waffles and turned it into a combo with eggs and sausage for a dollar more. The waffle was ok, a little soft for my taste. I have been craving a patty melt with grilled mushrooms, so I jumped on that. I also chose a bowl of chicken tortilla soup for my side. The soup was light. The patty melt was cooked to a perfect medium rare and juicy. Maybe it was a little too juicy because my rye bread was soggy. I love that they do not fry the sandwich in a ton of oil to make it crispy, but the second half of my sandwich had sopped up all the meat juices before I could get to it.   The experience was not bad, just not something I would drive across town for."}
{"text":"We have eaten here 3 times and enjoyed the food all 3 times.  I have had breakfast twice and a burger once and was satisfied with my choices.  Very clean inside and a comfortable atmosphere.  I like that is it not a typical chain cafe and it is close to our house to that is a plus!"}
{"text":"I really like the Breakfast, but the Lunch was amazing. I had the Tuna Melt and it was perfect. I'll be back for breakfast and Lunch. Everything is fresh. Chicken tortilla soup is made from scratch.....  very clean Cafe."}
{"text":"Sometimes the service outshines the food and this is one of the place that I would apply this to. Their food is very standard but with good quality. If you want inexpensive and straight to the point breakfast and lunch, this is the place to go. I have been going here for years when I don't feel like trying anything new because I know I will be treated very well and I will be satisfied with the food. The staff are always serving you with a sweet smile and they are quick on their feet. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Very nice neighborhood brunch place!  Waitress we had was very attentive and polite.  Food was good!  On the day we went my son had chocolate chip pancakes that came with 1 pc of bacon ($2.99), I had the chicken avocado sandwich with fries and my other half had huevos rancheros (both were $8.99).  Overall price and presentation of food was good.  Cinnamon roll @ $2.99 was small but still delicious.  We will be back soon (over IHOP and Eggworks)!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad. The service sucked! I almost walked out of the place it took so long for the check. But... it's a nice looking clean place, with a nice menu."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new cafe! Very small but extremely friendly staff. Orders were prompt and delicious! Menu was cheap and affordable. My bagel sandwich was very delicious and the home fries were even better. Great service and good food thanks for having us!"}
{"text":"I had a bacon turkey sandwich and it tasted fresh. I don't have much to compare with because I have only ate their once but the server was kind and we left happy."}
{"text":"Sat down figured out what we wanted waited 10 minutes with 4 waitresses talking to each other folding napkins we finally left and ate elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good breakfast/brunch here. When bar food isn't cutting it anymore this and Cracked Egg are my spots to grab real breakfast. The prices are pretty steep here for the amount of food you get so 3 stars instead of 4."}
{"text":"Love this place... I make it a point to try something different from the menu every time I come,  and so far,  I have not been disappointed. The service is great.  Staff is very attentive.  The ambiance is cozy,  but can get a bit noisy during breakfast on the weekend.  I consider it a \"hole in the wall\" only because of where it's located inside the shopping center.   But we all know, when it comes to food,  some of the best places are \"Hole in the Walls\"."}
{"text":"We come here quite often and we're always pleased with the food and the service.  The service is aways spot on. We're greeted promptly and sat promptly.  The food is good, hearty, breakfast. People complaining about lack of salt or pepper? I happen to like it that way. Let ME decide the amount of my seasoning thank you.   Lattes are delicious. Fried eggs are perfect. Hash browns are crispy. Corned beef hash is yummy.   Local, friendly, not too crowded. Love New Day Cafe."}
{"text":"What a great location! Before I found this hidden gem, I had to drive at least 10 mins for the closest breakfast spot. So I was thrilled to find this location!  This is your standard breakfast spot. Nothing special but pretty solid. The menu has all the basics with a handful of speciality items marked with their logo.  I ordered the Californian omelet which was good. Again, nothing spectacular but definitely met all my expectations.   The service was not the best... But in their defense I did overhear them say this was the busiest they've been. I sat at the counter (where presumably you would receive the fastest service) and I had to ask for everything - ask for them to take my order, utensils, a straw, jam. I didn't even get a hello when I sat down and about 10 of the staff members walked passed me.    I would come back but if the poor service continues-most likely not."}
{"text":"Pluses:  -service -price  Minuses: -water has strange taste  That's not an amazing place but enough good to stop over there."}
{"text":"This morning was my 1st time here. Might be my last. Service was adequate. Kind of slow but she was very friendly. Coffee was good but my main complaint was that my French toast was only Luke warm and not the tastiest. Maybe I'll give it another chance. Although I'd rather go to places I know I love like Layers and Sunrise cafe."}
{"text":"Food is ridiculously awesome. A new menu and raised prices has reduced the amount of times I will come back. Luckily the food remains the same with great taste and quality."}
{"text":"2 stars , my steak n eggs came well done , I ask for Medium R. My son's food came wrong , I did not have silver ware to eat when the food got to the table.  Server never stop by to check on us. Liked this place before that's why I.came back but totally disappointed today"}
{"text":"This place used to be great, not so much anymore. Pros - It is close to my house Cons - Had to go take silverware from another table               Asked for Coke, got diet coke, fixed              Rueben actually only had meat on one side, other half of sandwich was just dressing and kraut Not impressed and it is overpriced as well, won't be back, should have listened to the neighbors on this place."}
{"text":"Love their new locale at Silverado Ranch & Bermuda. It's larger, definitely more upscale.  I had an omelet with avocado, bacon, and cheddar.   Service was good. Wish I could remember the name of the waitress, she was attentive, not overbearing."}
{"text":"Breakfast bagels are really good. Biscuits and gravy are ok. Staff is mostly friendly."}
{"text":"We split three meals. There was plenty to eat. We all loved the California Omlett. The Hash was so so. The Eggs Benedict was pretty good. I think the food was plenty but a bit overpriced for a breakfast (either that or I was overcharged). The location was great for us since we were on the south end of the Strip."}
{"text":"Worst place to have breakfast. If you want cold pancakes,burnt bacon. Poor customer service then come to New Day cafe. Should of went to IHOP."}
{"text":"Very clean, good menu everything from  eggs Benedict, to Mexican to good home lunch & dinner cooking.  Even $3 beers!"}
{"text":"Tried it today because of the favorable reviews. Service was fast and friendly. Food wasn't what I was expecting. Chilaquiles were very bland and asking for poached eggs wasn't a good option either. Ended up more like hard boiled eggs. Willing to give this place another shot but Chilaquiles won't be on the menu"}
{"text":"Great food fresh tasting. Staff was super friendly and always around. Clean establishment. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"The food is okay, and even when it is slow, so is the service. They are a breakfast and lunch kind of place, no dinner service.  They don't have anything special that they are known for, food was so so, and a prices are competitively what you would pay at an ihop or Dennys."}
{"text":"Always go for breakfast! Fantastic service and great food!! Definitely a great place to relax and take care of business!  The coffee is actually good, unlike most breakfast joints!"}
{"text":"We like to have breakfast here...this time it was terrible,and they weren't busy...they 1st brought out old over cooked dryed up hash browns..then we tryed there home fries...these were so greasy and over cooked..could not eat...I love potatoes so very disappointed....lit wil be awhile before we go back.....there omelettes are also very small..."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm not feeling up to making breakfast at home, this is my go-to take out breakfast spot! The staff is super friendly and enthusiastic. What I love the most is that the food is ready usually within 10 minutes of me ordering. I normally order the California omelette, and it's always delicious. The only downside are the home fries. They're cooked a little too soft for my taste and they get fairly cold by the time I get home. But other than that, this place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Twas a windy terrible day, and therefore I had to get my car fixed. The check engine light was on and I was maybe 7,000 miles over my 3,000 mile checkup.  That's why I took off a star.  So we decided to head up New Day Inn. We were seated immediately. Had a coffee that tasted black. I'm not racist, but I had to add cream. That's why I took off a star.   Had a Cactus Jack omelet. I had to research popolitos (cactus) before committing to that. I was not wowed. It was good and not bad. That's why I took off a star.   I don't know if I cared much for the conversation and that's why I'm taking off the star. Geez, dad!  The atmosphere was nice and open (aka homey and devoid of customers). The food had potential for so much (bland). The waitress was good (not as hot as the food). So that's why I took off the star.   It was a good eating and I was relatively happy, but that's why I took off the star."}
{"text":"Friendly service but the food is just okay nothing special cheap ingredients of course they are not going to use Boars  Head hams only worht it if you are use a coupon we been there few times in the couple years always using Gruponn  deals ...lol Always the young females  servers they are nice n friendly in a professional way we're going back is a good place in the neighborhood easy  parking..."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not spectacular. I had the huervos la mexicana. I definitely demolished my plate, but there was no real \"wow\" factor. My sister in laws strawberry crepe looked really food... and she confirmed that it was. I could drive by with out stopping next time.  :-/"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago with a hung-over friend.  Place is cute, very airy, and our server chatted with us and was good about checking up.  My friend had the veggie omelet and I had one with bacon and avocado.  They diced the avocado into the omelet instead of just plopping it on top, which was a nice touch and kept my leftovers from going brown.  We both liked the hash browns, they needed ketchup for sure, but to me all hash browns require ketchup.  Hot tea selection was a nice array of options, it always irks me when a place charges you $2-3 for a plain Lipton bag."}
{"text":"No complaints for a good fast breakfast.  Server was on top of her game.  Was in about 9am, on a weekday, nice an quiet.  However, at rush hour I imagine it could get noisy. Everything was impeccably clean."}
{"text":"Adorable, little hole in the walk, a 2 min drive from our house. Service was good, prices were decent, food was super yummy!! I tried the country Benedict, which I have never had before, and my gf had the breakfast quesadilla. Both had generous portions, enough to take home for leftovers. Overall, very impressed and we feel we've found our new favorite breakfast spot. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I think I need to take my half star back.  The food here has always been pretty solid. Lately I've noticed that the portions have shrunk, but the prices haven't. We came for a late breakfast after hitting the gym, so we were pretty hungry. I decided on a sandwich while my mom and fella got the chilaquiles. My meal was ok. The place has never really wowed me with their food, but it's always decent. Today was no exception. The only problem was that my mom and fella's food was oh so tiny. Their chilaquiles barely took up half of the plate, so they were disappointed to say the least. My sandwich was ok, but I had hoped for a little more oomph flavor-wise.   Overall, we had an ok meal, but we'll probably try some other diners in the area when we're feeling extra hungry from our morning workout."}
{"text":"I've been to New Day Cafe a couple of times now and they always have quick service with delicious food. The morning drink specials are great and I love that they have the alcohol option unlike many breakfast places around town. Big portions for a good price, it's a great value. They are on groupon once in a while too, so check that out for an even better deal!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Anthem Highlands and was hoping to find a hidden gem. Well by the star rating you can probably guess that I didn't.  Very plain and basic, Denny's and IHOP are better choices and that's not saying much.  Rise and Shine please open another location up here in Anthem Highlands."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. It's reasonably priced and delicious. My fiance and I love coming here on the weekend when we want breakfast quickly. They are always busy, and we've never waited longer than 2 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"Well, I was hoping the negative reviews were just a bunch of sour grapes. They're not. As a few have said, the service is better than the food. Nice location, clean and roomy. Server was polite and efficient, which was good with me. I don't need bubbles and sunshine from my server.  Crepes Combo: scrambled eggs were wet and hovering on the edge of cold; bacon was a second away from being burned but at least it was warm; strawberry crepes..... no. I know that sweet crepes are sometimes filled with a flavored cream cheese. Cream cheese would have been fine if it was plain and sweetened with a little sugar, then add a few slices of strawberry. But these crepes were stuffed with what tasted like an off-brand strawberry-flavored cream cheese from an economy tub. A thin smear on a bagel might be okay; but gobs of it in one bite, not so much. There was maybe one sliced strawberry on top to decorate both crepes. Obviously I did not finish them. I ate one after squishing out half the filling and sliding the crepe through the strawberry sauce on the plate. Side note: I wasn't in a hurry, but I was in and out in about 30 minutes. Good if you're looking to fill your tummy quickly with something other than fast food fare or buffet bacteria bonanza. I don't say stay away from this place, just don't expect amazing, yum, so delicious. Maybe it's there in another dish."}
