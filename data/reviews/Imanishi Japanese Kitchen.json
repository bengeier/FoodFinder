{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend Cody he's soooooooooo cute. I love this restaurant ! It's the best chill vibes ever ! Xoxox Basia"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious small plates of Japanese comfort food..casual and cozy inside.. and the usual friendly service that's you get in Canada.. we are from NY so we told our server who's crazy about pizza the spots to go in NY for the real deal old school pizza.. Lucali and of course DiFaras.. if you know Village Yokocho in NY you will absolutely love this place.. the sweetest scallop sashimi I've ever tasted!!"}
{"text":"This place is me and my partner's go-to place. The ambiance, music, service and most importantly, food is just amazing. Can't really go wrong with anything on the menu although I must say that pork cheek was a bit too tangy for my taste. But for the rest, they are all excellent, including their chu-hi drinks."}
{"text":"This place has me coming back! The ingredients are fresh and tasty, and haven't been disappointed yet. Staffs are very friendly and making sure we are happy and fulfilled! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Everything from the food and cocktails to service and atmosphere are exceptional. It's homey and welcoming all the while being very traditional. A must go-to before it gets wildly busy!"}
{"text":"Would not reccomend, Service was absolutely terrible.  My friend was informed that a wait would be around 1 hour, and they would call us back. They also told us that kitchen would close @ 11 PM, but our table should be ready @ 10 PM.  I (a different person) actually went in to talk to the manager/waitress to confirm our spot on the waitlist, and she rudely asked me \"didnt i already explain everything to you, youre on the list!\"  No big deal, i was willing to wait. When we arrived around 10, we were a bit concerned that when we got a table, there would not be ample time to order food. Me and another friend wanted to simply confirm that there would be sufficient time to order and eat. The manager kept trying to dance around our question, telling us how she laid out the rules earlier in the night, such as \"The wait is 1 hour, perhaps more, the kitchen closes at  11. \" It seems she did not want to serve a fresh group so close to closing, but this cant possibly have been the case as she sat down 2 other groups right before mine. Finally, she told us, quite curtly, \"Oh these people are paying\". She did not indicate that was our table or anything of the sort. We actually stood outside for a long period of time before approaching her again.  However, we still did not get to our table. Instead, she talked to the owner /bartenderwho basically told us, he didnt want our business. We were accused of \"yelling\" and \"swearing\" at the manager during our initial conversation. He said it was necessary to keep good vibes in the restaurant, and hostile people out. Quite amusing, as during our conversations with the manager, the owner/bartender was right beside us, at the bar making drinks. When i questioned him point blank about the accusations (since he was right there) he more or less had nothing to say, cat had his tongue for some reason. Not sure why this manager was making up stores to her boss, We have never seen or met her before, but treating customers this way is totally unacceptable. We were not a loud or rambunctious group, well dressed, just wanted some good food. She didnt even take the time to make sure she was talking to the same person, me and my friend look nothing alike, wearing completely different outfits, in fact one wears glasses and the others didnt. If it wasn't an Asian establishment itself, i'd wonder if they had an issue with our race, because three other groups of waiting Caucasians were seated with no trouble and we werent even invited into the establishment.  TL;DR: after over an hour of waiting manager and owner did not want us seated. Manager made up a ridiculous story and owner tried to interrogate us before allowing us permission to approach a table. Do not recommend, absolutely terrible service"}
{"text":"Finally something different in the world of Toronto Japanese restaurants. This is NOT a sushi bar - although the daily sashimi is always to perfection. I see a few haters have reviewed this place and it seems to me people have come to equivocate Japanese food with sushi and get disappointed when they don't get the typical all you can eat roll jammer. Go to China town or College St for that.    This is authentic home style Japanese food. (Actually owned by Japanese people- **super rare)  My go to's are the Raman and pork cutlet with veg curry.  Last time I tried their deep fried chicken and it blew me away.  It's a really cool little spot to get'er going on a Friday night.    The best thing is that the price points are VERY responsible!"}
{"text":"Went last night. The good- the food. The bad- half the seats are very low uncomfortable hard stools. Still no sign so drove by it twice. The prices have risen already from what I saw on some recent reviews. That didn't take long !  The food being the most important but the stools ruin the experience ! Also no longer better value when compared to other Izakayas."}
{"text":"Great izakaya-like spot, would definitely recommend. We ordered pretty much the entire menu with house sake - delicious, all of it. The corn kakiage, tai carpaccio and tebasaki chicken wings were a-maz-ing, the potato salad we could have gone without. Overall a sweet spot for drinks and plates."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night, really nice space with a good vibe. The food was quick and really delicious, we had the sashimi special appetizer which was a good size, and I also really enjoyed the chicken wings- amazing sauce. We found the front to be a bit bright, and the coat hanging situation a little awkward, but overall really impressed. I think the front signage is confusing to a few people, once that changes I'm sure they will be more busy.It's a good start to this spot, nice addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"My husband and I were trying to get a reservation for the past few weeks and finally got a spot on Sunday night. Hidden little hipster joint, best place to drink a few with small appetizers.  Felt cozy, along with 90s? Japanese pop music.  Service was excellent, got great recommendations from the menu.  So far we tried Tai Carpaccio and chicken wings: both appetizers were amazing so we wish there were more portions.  Also anchovy potato salad was great munchies with drinks too but if you expect to try authentic Japanese potato salad, this is not what you are looking for.   I highly recommend to try Chicken Nanban for entree, comes with pickles, white rice and miso soup."}
{"text":"This is not your conventional sushi joint. They serve small sharing dishes great to nibble on while sipping on plum wine,  We ordered the guai lan,  squid, mackerel, the ginger onion sake pork. These were all tasty but the best dish was surprisingly the corn tempura.  The drinks I had were served as pure liquor on the rocks ... I was not impressed  so I decided to stick to plum wine after that.  Their cocktail list could improve.  Good spot for a casual date. Reservations are recommended as this place was packed on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 8.5/10 Food: 8.5/10 Atmosphere: 8.5/10 Service: 9/10  What a wonderful, cute, quaint restaurant in the Ossington area. If you are looking for something different, but something very Japanese, highly recommend!  The place is small and warm, and the service is attentive. Some food is definitely better than others, hits for me were the ramen, octopus (comes with celery) and the sashimi special.  A huge win in terms of bang for buck. The sashimi special made up 25% of our cost. Without which, we would have been equally satisfied, and bill would have been that much lower.   THE BOTTOM LINE: fantastic value, yummy non-traditional Japanese fare and a warm environment."}
{"text":"Everything was pretty good. It's kind of a Japanese bar/ more traditional restaurant mix (grilled fish)  I ordered a few tapas but they didn't really do it for me -   corn tempura (kinda pricey and it's just deep fried corn)  Butter squid - can never go wrong!  Mackerel - would stay away. Wasn't bad but not worth it. Small portions for all  The star was my chicken nanban set - it was huge. Like four/five pieces of juicy tartar sauce covered chicken with rice and soup. For 10/12 bucks. A perfect dinner."}
{"text":"This is a hard place to find, but once inside has beautiful interior decor! It has a nice vibe and good drinks. I would say the dishes were very simple and well thought out, but I would not say that every dish stood out on its own. This place has more appetizers than main course dishes, which aligns more with an izakaya vibe. We tried the octopus, grilled squid, red snapper carpaccio, ramen, tonkatsu curry, and two drinks off the menu. The only dish that I liked was the carpaccio, everything had a home cooked vibe that I would not want to pay ~10$ a dish for. I would only pay 10$ for the squid, because Squid is naturally not cheap. It would be good if they added a bit more \"Jazz\" to their tako celery by adding more ginger pieces to make it unique. We had taro root icecream which was very good, I was not sure if it was homemade but nonetheless a great flavour. If this place was more central I think it would get more business, but it needs to bring a bit more \"A\" game to get people to travel west to eat here more than once. On the right track, but unless I hear of some dish upgrades accompanied by rave reviews I will not return."}
{"text":"Hit this place up!! Every dish we have had has been delicious and unique. The serving time per dish was 100 percent, everything came out in a perfectly one manner. The sake we ordered was promptly brought out before first dish which in my opinion is good. Waiters were friendly and knowledgeable. Decor is number in my book!"}
{"text":"A super great Izakaya.  The menus was great, especially the sashimi which was stonkingly fresh.  Sam behind the bar was a true gent, and does his best to ensure everyone walks out with a smile on their stomach.  Definitely a go-to place."}
{"text":"If you want to splurge, this is the place to do it. Go with a friend and split the dishes! They aren't very big portions, so you can try a lot of different things.  The chicken wings were to die for, and I also had a special eel tempura bowl. I would absolutely get that if it pops up on the specials! Good selection of sake and cocktails.  Service was very good and the waiter was super attentive, though the food took a bit to come out."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt my fave new izakaya place! The flavour of everything we had was amazing and the spices added great zest to all the dishes! They have nice seating options of either a wrap around wooden bench or various tables. They offer drinks specials where they have sake and option for liter beer draughts which pair nicely with each meal. The sashimi are amazing! service was very fast and friendly. Definitely will return soon"}
{"text":"Great spot with a different style of Japanese food.  Definitely a nice step away from your tepanyaki, guu style resto, or sushi/ramen.    The ika mariyaku is a whole grilled sliced squid - great for sharing and a larger portion.  The makarel is deliberately not deboned (be careful), but it is extremely tasty otherwise.  The corn tempura was light and sweet.  They also have these small set meals that come with rice and miso soup.  We tried the pork which was a little bland, but still good - I'd try the fried chicken next time.  The plum wine is to die for!! The interior of the restaurant has a neat authentic japanese feel to it too with the vinyl interlocking flooring.  I really enjoyed this place and would recommend it."}
{"text":"The most impressive thing is the taro ice cream with fried soba on the top. Soooo savoury. The squid ring was also good. But the beef in Gyudon was too salty and fat for me."}
{"text":"Had the saba ( mackerel on skewer), eggplant, rib eye steak, grilled octopus, stingray fin, monkfish pate, katsu curry, pork cheek. Everything was really really salty!! Yuck! Never again."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday for a light dinner/snack. It was slightly busy, but we were still able to sit down.   What I liked:  - The food. It was very good. We had the cilantro shrimp salad (I didn't expect it to knock my socks off, but it did), grilled squid (also quite good), and sashimi plate (the fish was cold and fresh, just the way it should be)  - The service. We weren't over or under served. Our server was friendly and helpful. Waiting time was reasonable.   - Ambiance. It was super cozy and relaxed.   What I didn't like:  - The selection. I found the selection limited because it was only one page of tapas, and not enough enticing options (for me, at least). I picked a few things and was happy with them, but there was nothing I felt I just had to get. If we picked a fourth option, I would have struggled to find something I wanted. This isn't a problem I usually have at Izakayas.   - Prices. I didn't pay, but I did see the prices on the menu. I know tapas are not cheap, but I thought it was a bit ridiculous to pay $19 for a sashimi platter, which had 9 pieces of fish. It wasn't even butterfish or tuna belly, it was your regular standard fare (i.e. salmon).  Bottom Line: Great place for a date. Very relaxed/cozy ambiance makes for a comfortable environment to get to know someone. Don't come here if you're picky or very hungry."}
{"text":"A very homie bar / restaurant with great food. Accommodating staff and great music play list. We tried almost everything on the tapa menu and some stand outs are: Beef tartare, anchovy potato salad, and chicken wings.   This restaurant is a great addition to the neighbourhood and the vibe and food can attest to it. I think we found our new hangout!   PS. We liked the music so much and the owner came to talk to us about it!"}
{"text":"The Monkfish Liver Pâté was definitely one of my favourite tapas of the whole night!  It was monkfish liver pâté served with four baguette slices (that seemed to have some garlic on it too).  I really enjoyed this one because the baguette were perfectly toasted with garlic on top (I love garlic bread!) and the monkfish liver pâté was so creamy and tasty!  However, I couldn't distinguish any monkfish liver taste in the pâté...  I think they must have mixed it with some mayo because its consistency and texture definitely tasted more like mayo instead of actual pâté."}
{"text":"I read about this place on BlogTo and wow, so happy I learned about it because it's a very deceptive restaurant front. I would have missed it every time.   I enjoy sushi, but my heart is with home styled Japanese food. The spicy Ramen is wonderful. Very different that the traditional Toronto Ramen house but amazing nonetheless. The Pork Katsu Curry is like a warm hug. Perfect for the winter months.   The cocktails are a lot of fun and the space is very cute. I love the music too!"}
{"text":"I was blown away by each of the six dishes I tried here last Saturday night.  We arrived at 8pm and had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  I was initially tempted to walk away and try another restaurant (I was not initially too enticed by the menu as a non-fish eater) but I am happy we waited.  There was surprisingly enough non-fish options on the menu (although I'm sure most of the 4-5 star reviewers are raving about the fish!).  We tried to tofu salad, tempura corn, broccoli, tempura mushrooms, chicken wings and curry.  Seeing as the dishes are tiny (and a bit overpriced considering the size), I appreciated that they came out close to each other in sequence as each dish left us wanting more.  For each dish, I felt the sauce really took it over the edge.  Something as simple as the tofu salad (which was just cold tofu and lettuce) tasted so unique and special dressed in the ginger dressing (so much so I licked the bowl after).  The environment is very casual where patrons hang their jackets on the side of the walls behind the tables, which created for a unique display on a cold Toronto night."}
{"text":"The place is quite good. I wasn't wowed by the food but I certainly enjoyed every dish that came out. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Each dish was tasty. Service was regular. Ambiance was nice with a hint of Japanese izakaya feels.   Imanishi offers izayaka small dishes with a few rice dishes and ramen. We ordered quite a few things:  Ebi fry curry rice - the ebi fry can come on its own but we opted to get it with rice and curry. The curry was reminiscent of curry in Japan; thick, sweet with a hint of spicy. The ebi itself was a fat one and fried to perfection. It didn't taste oily nor was the batter too thick. Also had the right crispness even when it's been in curry. The ebi comes with a tartar sauce like dip drizzled on top, that was light but added a creaminess to the overall curry. I enjoyed it lots! Also came with cabbage.  Yuzu karaage - karaage fried perfectly and as like the ebi it wasn't greasy and the chicken was still juicy inside. There was a hint of citrus from the yuzu even though I didn't squirt any lemon on it.  Squid - the squid was grilled to a good consistency. The squid wasn't rubbery and had a good seasoning to it. I would say nothing special but delicious nonetheless.  Sashimi - we had scallop, hamachi, and tuna. All were very fresh, not fishy at all. The scallop was smooth and sweet but not slimy. Delicious.  Chicken wings - I don't recall what this was named but the marinade was a soy based marinade and the wings were perfect. Again, juicy inside and flavourful.   Corn kakiage - light batter and slightly buttery. I do find the corn kakiage from menami to taste better but I quite enjoyed this as well.  Nagoya ramen - nothing special. Ramen was slightly softer than my liking and the broth was good but not sure f I would order again.  Lastly, taro ice cream with shokupan- taro ice cream was delicious! Creamy, aromatic with taro, and overall paired very well with the brown rice pops. Ordering the shokupan was a great idea. Soft bread with a crispy outer coating. The hotness of the pan contrasting the cold taro ice cream completed and balanced the whole dish!   Needless to say, will love to come back and try more."}
{"text":"Fun cocktails, great food and pleasant atmosphere gets 4 stars in my books! Imanishi was a great choice for our group outing. Be sure to book in advance.   My menu recommendations are: Sashimi Mori, Corn Kakiage and the Tofu & Mizuna Salad (if I could drink the dressing I would...). All the food was fresh & mouthwatering delicious! Drinks-wise I would suggest the Sakoku, a sweet potato shochu based drink with a lemon-y flavour."}
{"text":"Really yummy place for a casual dinner. Good Asian food, reasonable prices, nice ambience"}
{"text":"This place deserves 6 stars. I was seriously blown away by the food here while visiting Toronto for the first time.   A friend suggested we check this spot out, and I'm so glad we did. I wasn't really wowed by the menu, so let my boyfriend order whatever he wanted for us to share.   I had one bite of the sashimi.. and was slapped across the face with its freshness and knew I had underestimated this place. It was probably some of the best fish I've had. Another memorable dish were the chicken wings, and also the beef short ribs. I wish I could even describe how good they were, but there are no words. You must experience it for yourself.   Love the atmosphere here. It's super chill and relaxed. I loved the memorabilia on the wall, and thought it was cool to see people's coats hanging on the wall. It's like an ever-rotating art gallery of the clothes and expressions of the guests eating here.   It's a small and intimate place, so I'd recommend making a reservation if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Came to Imanishi with a party of four for dinner one night, after hearing the hype and with the insane waits for walk-ins, we made sure we had reservations.  We started by ordering the Calpico-Hi and Umeboshi-Hi, two chu-hi cocktails on their drinks menu. The Calpico-Hi was tasty and refreshing, offering a sweet flavour that blends well with the taste of shochu. The Umeboshi-Hi, however, is an acquired taste, which I would only recommend if you're looking for a sweet and salty sort of cocktail.  For food, we ordered quite a few items off of the menu.  The first three dishes that came out were the Tai Carpaccio, Beef Tataki, and Cold Served Agadashi Eggplant. These small bites were a decent way to start the meal, though it was surprising that the carpaccio and tataki lacked much flavour, and I tended to favour the eggplant. The Grilled Sting Ray Fin followed, and was of an unexpectedly good texture, and the dipping sauce complemented it well.  The highlight of my entire meal goes to the Monkfish Liver Pate. It came in a little terrine with four thick cuts of garlic bread stacked, and it's very rich and intense. Very delicious overall, and I certainly wished there was more of it. And more of the bread. That's a recurring theme with this meal.  The second best dish of the night was the Corn Kakiage. It appeared on the table as a big mass of battered and fried corn, but it broke apart with some gentle chopstick action. Crunchy, sweet, and quite savoury, it was a surprisingly delicious dish.  What followed were three so-so dishes. Tebasaki, or Nagoya style chicken wings, were decent, and at least had a nice crunch to them. The Nagoya Ramen had a decent broth and noodles, in addition to the disappointingly small portion. Lastly, the Salt & Sansho Pepper Grilled Pork Cheek, which came about 20 minutes after everything else did and some gentle reminders that we had ordered it, was not worth the wait.  We finished with taro ice cream. I was not disappointed in the ice cream, thankfully.  Honestly, I was kind of really hungry at the end of the meal, which is a pretty good summation of my meal at Imanishi: it was an alright, but quite unsatisfying. And given what we were paying for the meal, is quite the price to leave unsatisfied. Some interesting takes on izakaya food, but I don't think I'd come back."}
{"text":"Honestly, the food here is pretty good. However, given my overall experience, I'd have to give this place around a 2.5.   We had the beef tataki, gai lan gomaae, salt and sansho pepper grilled pork cheek, corn kakiage, ika maruyaki, saba miso-ni, chicken nanban, anchovy potato salad and chips, braised pork ribs, and taro ice cream between 5 adults and 1 toddler. Something like that. We weren't particularly hungry, so we decided we'd start with that and order more if necessary.   A large part of how I determine how many stars to give a place is based on how satisfied I was upon leaving. For restaurants, this takes into account things like value (taste + portion to price ratio), service, ambiance, etc., with the bulk of it being placed on those first two. The ambiance here was fine, but I found the value and the service lacking. For the price of the dishes I listed above, I was expecting quite a bit more food. For example, the corn kakiage was $7.5 and had two flat pieces about the size of the bottom of a mug. There were no garnishes, and I didn't see any salt that it was supposed to be served with, unless they just sprinkled salt on it and decided to include it in the menu description. That's $7.50 for what is essentially two corn fritters. Corn is cheap. I was also expecting the food to come significantly more rapidly than it did. The service was friendly, but most of our dishes came one at a time, and we'd finish rather quickly because the dish was so small, and then have to wait at least a few minutes before the next one came. I don't mind that so much if we're doing a menu with multiple courses, but if I'm at an izakaya style place, I don't want to sit there for an hour waiting for my mains to come. Our toddler was the epitome of hangry. Her parents asked for the rice in one of our small teishoku meals to be given to us first so she'd have something to eat. The toddler had the entire bowl of rice, then had bites of most of our other dishes, saying she wanted more after each one and us finding that there was no more food on the table, and then finally got the miso soup and main that came with her rice.   Flavor-wise, everything was average and above. The beef tataki was tasty, but a tad chewy. The gai lan gomaae had a really delicious sauce. The pork cheek was flavorful and surprisingly crispy in a pleasant way. The corn kakiage was incredibly delicious, and one of highlights of the night. The ika maruyaki was prettily presented, but not particularly tender and a tad salty. The saba miso-ni was not bad, but not particularly noteworthy, and when they say small teishoku, they're not kidding. The saba was served on a plate approximately the size of a coaster. The chicken nanban wasn't particularly special, although I quite enjoyed the pickled veggies on the side. The anchovy potato salad was tasty, but I didn't taste the anchovies. I find that dish interesting because taro chips + potato salad = starch on starch. The pork ribs were incredibly tender, but flavor-wise, I've already forgotten about them. The mustard sauce that was on the plate was good at cutting some of the richness of the ribs though. My favorite bite of the night was the Japanese toast under the taro ice cream. The entire dish was tasty, but that toast was fried to perfection and the crispy, oily toast worked wonderfully with the ice cream.  After 15% tip, I paid almost $24 for my meal (we divided by 5). I had parts of every dish we ordered, but somewhere between a bite and two bites, for the most part, of each dish, and some bites weren't very large bites. Because of the portions and the time it took for each dish to come out, I actually left just about as hungry as I went in.   Should there be a next time, I think I'm going to order the ramen because I've heard it's good, and then just call it a day."}
{"text":"My friends wanted to try out this izakaya for a while.  When I arrived, I was having trouble finding the place as the large sign outside displayed another place. I was actually worried until I took a third look inside plus glanced at the address again when comparing to the one on Yelp.  We luckily reserved a table beforehand and also beat the freak rain storm. The staff informed us that the table was reserved after our meal but would be welcomed to stay longer if there is space. When I arrived at 7 pm, the restaurant was half full but quickly filled up in 30 minutes.  We had a variety of food including grilled squid, corn kariage, and sashimi mori. I thought the sashi mori which was three types of seafood was the best.  I love my scallops. My friends enjoyed the corn kariage but all of us afreed that the frilled squid was disappointing.  We did not return this dish but felt it was overcooked.  They had two types of sake. We started with the more expensive bottle and enjoyed the taste as it was smooth. The next one was the house sake which we also enjoyed and for the price, it was the valued play.  I would not mind coming back especially if they serve sting ray again. They should update the sign outside as the staff told me that they have been opened for a few months. The staff was friendly and helpful with our food selection."}
{"text":"Just really good, not ridiculously fancy, great tasting food. Prices were good, portion sizes were decent, and the sauces of all the food we ordered was, seriously, totally unbelievable.  The gamooee or something something had this peanut sauce that was so good, I wanted a spoon to eat it at the end. Everything about this place is unassuming, chill, and tasty as hell. Even the ice cream with this mysterious buckwheat on top. $3. Can't miss.   Awesome."}
{"text":"One of the coziest izakaya style bars in town. There's often a line at the door so you might want to go on nonparty night if you want to avoid the wait.  My favourite thing here is the whole grilled squid - ika maruyaki. Very intricately flavoured with spices with mayo on the side.  Ugh delish! Makes me drool just thinking about it.  Everything is priced around 10 or under so my partner and I spent about 60 dollars total including a drink each.   Highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy a relaxing and romantic night with nice cocktails and Japanese tapa food."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and service. We were seated immediately without a reservation on a Friday evening. Among three of us we ordered four small plates and two rice dishes, and it was more than enough food. Highlights were the eggplant, pork katsu, grilled squid, and potato salad."}
{"text":"Great service and very fresh seafood. Loved the Japanese beer selection too. The sign was a bit small so i walked by it three times but inside the atmosphere was casual with vintage japanese posters/art."}
{"text":"You will not find imanishi at first glance even with Google Street view. It will appear to be a euro styled cafe from the outside. Once you park and walk right upto the front steps...you'll see imanishi imprinted neatly on the bottom right corner of the front window.   Very simple and trendy decor, neat coat racks, wonderful music, clean and wood trimmed. Good space for talking and not overly loud or quiet. Horrendously uncomfortable stools to sit on. Only draw back. And well.. i was corrected on how to pronounce the cocktail \"aloe-hi\".   Staff is very good at their job. Both front of house and kitchen staff.  Just order the whole menu. My favourite item was the eggplant.  The sushi isn't great.   But everything else was very good. Please try. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Imanishi is fantastic.   This is everything you want in a neighborhood joint. Friendly, welcoming, cool, super fun. It's a gorgeous space, decorated with genuine Japanese hipster cred.   The food is awesome - these are real Japanese flavours! They are doing everything right here. We had the the Cold Served Agedashi Eggplant, the Guai Lan Gomaae, Tai Carpaccio, Curry Spring Roll, Saba Miso-ni, and Taro ice cream. All were beautifully presented, with unique takes on izakaya faves, like the Guai Lan greens instead of the traditional spinach in gomaae. It works! It all works. I would order everything on that list again, a million times. Cocktails were also very good, as were the comp Jameson shots we had the pleasure of sharing with the owner, Daisuke. Thanks so much dude!  At 10pm on Th night, they were already sold out of Tebasaki chicken wings. I will be back VERY SOON to try these - haven't been able to find any proper tebasaki since leaving So Cal a long time ago... there are whole restaurants devoted to tebasaki in LA, it's about time we had tebasaki in TO. Cannot wait to try, and will definitely be spending a lot of time at Imanishi, even when the wings are sold out. ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing Japanese restaurant in Little Portugal! I had the Omurice with tomato rice, Cold served agedashi eggplant, and Anchovy potato salad with taro chips.  I recommend the omurice if you come on a weekend lunch - it falls apart nicely when you cut it through the middle. It is served on a bed of savoury tomato rice, and comes with a miso soup and salad.   Another highlight was the agedashi eggplant which was very flavourful despite it being served cold.   I personally dislike the seating which is bench-like at the front of the restaurant, and the service was okay. Otherwise, this spot serves great Japanese food!"}
{"text":"This review is for the nagoya-style ramen, a dark auburn-coloured, richly flavoured broth with perfect noodles, a nice amount of ground beef and pork, and a smattering of sesame seeds. I've never had ramen like this before, and I absolutely loved the broth...but my dining companion said she'd rate the soup a 3 due to its lack of inclusions, like egg, veggies or slices of fatty pork. It did have some sliced mild peppers in it, but certainly was a very brothy soup overall.  Me personally, I thought it was lovely! So I'm giving it a 4.  I also enjoyed a lemon chu-hai, a refreshing, not-too-sweet carbonated alcoholic bevvy that brought me right back to Tokyo, where I remember drinking it out of cans while touring the city. But it's quite light on the booze, so don't expect to get a buzz from just one.  Overall, neat little spot! I heard the wings and corn fritters are also amazing here, so I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really liked this the first couple times I went. Perhaps there was a novelty factor. The atmosphere is nice, cosy and the food is really delicious. If you want to go to a hip(ster) place for drinks and a few small dishes, Imanishi is great for that.   However, the portions are too small for the price. My boyfriend and I both thought the portions decreased slightly in size over the past year, and we agreed that you can find better Japanese izakaya-style food, value-wise, in Toronto."}
{"text":"The good:  I loved the decor of the restaurant. It was nice to see the little things, for example the stack of Japanese magazines at the very top of the bar, or the cute little Japanese reservation signs, and that check out sign that was all in Japanese - basically everything screaming out to you that this was a Japanese restaurant.   The second thing that was good was the two cocktails that I had. The plum wine negroni gave a nice kick. The Dai Dai orange sour definitely had an orange sweetness to it.  The bad:  Everything else.  Tako celery: it is literally what the name states it is. Very plain. Ika maruyaki: it was soft which made it nicer to eat but aside from that, it's a very plain dish in terms of flavour. Tai carpaccio: this dish I enjoyed, you can taste the yuzu citrus, which I've never had with the red snappers. Nagoya ramen: better to go to a dedicated ramen shop... Katsu curry rice: better to go to a dedicated Japanese curry place...  Neutral:  Service was on time and polite. Reserved on the day of. Seated without any waits."}
{"text":"had a cocktail there a friend recommended tasted like a milkshake mixed with sake. was 15.90$. got laughed at by my whole table."}
{"text":"Went here on a relative \"whim\" and was pleasantly surprised! The food was creative and very tasty and the service was quite good. I would dine here again just to have something different than the usual Japanese fusion. If you go, have the fish!"}
{"text":"Food was good. It reminded me of a \"Guu\". The quality of the food for the price was great! Loved the Tai carpaccio and the Katsu curry. Wished they had a more evolved dessert menu. Nevertheless will certainly go back!"}
{"text":"My favorite Japanese restaurant in Toronto so far. Reservation is highly recommended. The food is different than other Izakayas in the city and restaurant is fairly quiet/relaxing.   My friends and I shared these drinks: Yuzu & Shiso Mojito ($12); Oolong-Hi ($7); Plum Wine Negroni ($12).  The mojito was the best - very refreshing. Oolong-Hi was ok, couldn't taste the tea or alcohol. The plum wine is a must if you love gin.   *Agedashi Eggplant - $6 Eggplant was tender and flavorfull. Not greasy at all despite being deep fried!   *Tai Carpaccio - $14 The paper-thin red snapper was translucent, smooth and light. The tangy yuzu dressing brought out the freshness of the red snapper.   *Sashimi Mori - $19 happy to tell you though that the fish + wasabi were fresh. Fish had a melted-in-your-mouth texture.   *Anchovy Potato Salad & Chips - $6.5 Didn't like it. The anchovy was undetectable and salad was quite bland. But it went well with the chips. I also appreciate that the salad was smooth yet still had nice chunks of potato in it for some texture.  *Grilled Sting Ray Fin - $5.2 The stingray itself had an odd texture: a little chew and tough - but similar to the packaged dried squid in Asian grocery store. The fin was sweet and had a slight fish taste, and the char from the grill gave it a smoky flavor that seemed to just enhance the taste of the stingray.   *Monkfish Liver Pate - $8.5 pate was rich and creamy, but yet at the same time very light and delicate. Love.   *Ika Maruyaki - $9 The squid was tender inside yet still remained to be chewy on the outside. Seasoned perfectly and served with a dollop of yummy mayonnaise infused with a kick from the garlic."}
{"text":"A delightful treat for the taste buds!  Having tried most things on their fairly extensive appetizer menu (it's  Japanese tapas style resultant), it is a delicious treat for the palette. Creative, unusual items such a sting ray fin and corn kakiage ($6.50) are must tries. The sushi appetizers are fresh and even more mundane dishes such as the Chinese vegetable guai lan (Guai Lan Gomaae $3.80) are elevated. These dishes are all prefect to share with a group of friends. Even when you order the Nagoya Ramen ($9.80), they bring out extra bowls for each of you (without having to ask), understanding that it's all meant to be shared. Most of the dishes cost under $10.   Other must tries: the Saba Miso-Ni (mackerel) and Tebasaki (chicken wings).  The drink menu also offers a range of sakes and cocktails. I highly recommend the Yuzu Tom Collins or the Yuzu & Shiso Mojito.   The decor is tastefully done. The environment is inviting and warm. The staff is exceptional and highly attentive.   This is a great little restaurant, a definite gem in the neighborhood. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good food. Fun atmosphere. Good for small groups and food sharing. Monk fish pate is a must order. Chicken wings were good. Ramen was ok. Would go back"}
{"text":"Pretty cool vibe, delicious food and great service. Small plate izakaya spot on Dundas with some pretty interesting selections. We opted for the potato salad, monkfish liver pate, fried shrimp and garlic-soy chicken wings. The potato salad was surprisingly delicious, flanked by some taro chips. The shrimp were pretty good, but didn't blow me away. The real star of the show was the monkfish liver pate. Executed perfectly, it's almost a challenge to explain. The wings were fresh, unique and tasty. The food has an underlying homemade feel to it, but not amateur."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Was quoted an hour wait for our party of two with no reservation only to watch an incomplete party of three be seated immediately when they walked in 10 minutes later (also with no reservation) at one of two open four-tops. Upon further investigation, apparently it is their policy that parties of two may not sit at a table for four. Hmm. Kind of just looked they were friends with the server."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! The Sashimi, fried corn, beef tartare and sake were all delicious. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Looooove this izakaya!  Modern decor, chill atmosphere and most importantly, uber delicious food.  Between the Mr and I, we ordered the chicken wings, fried corn, ramen, tofu salad and grilled squid. We killed it and had room for taro ice cream.   The star dishes of the night were definitely the corn kakiage and ramen.  The corn was super sweet and crunchy, so heavenly with some light batter. The ramen at imanishi is easily one of my favourite ramen in Toronto. The broth was so addictively tasty that I drank it all!  The texture and tenderness of the noodles were perfect!  Just the way I like it.  I personally found the chicken wings to be a bit salty but the flavour was pretty decent.  Last but certainly not least, that taro ice cream...hmmmm....drool."}
{"text":"The storefront sign is still from the previous bar & grill establishment, and with casual café-style décor one could easily miss this humble izakaya from outside.  The wooden stools could be a bit uncomfortable, I would suggest the tables in the back since those ones at least have padded back seating built against the wall.  The restaurant is not as noisy as other typical izakaya, you won't hear the staff chanting here, which is nice if you want a quiet meal.  Another bonus point, they take reservation here.   The food menu is a simple one-page list of appetizers and teishoku (set menu with miso soup and rice).  We ordered Anchovy Potato Salad, Tomato Salad, Agedashi Egg Plant, Tako Celery, Beef Tataki, Corn Kakiage, Curry Spring Roll, Tebasaki (chicken wings), Chicken Nanban Teishoku (deep fried chicken thigh), and Katsu Curry Rice.  Some dishes were uncommon but very welcomed by the group, like the Stingray Fin and Corn Kakiage.  The Stingray Fin was not on the menu and was complimentary.  It was soft, chewy and aromatic, tasted like dried shredded squid and went well with beer.  Corn Kakiage was corn kernels tempura, light and savoury, we loved this dish so much we had 6 orders of it.  Beef Tataki was sliced seared beef with red onions and deep dried chick peas, I normally do not eat rare beef, but this dish was tasty and melted in my mouth.  The rest of the dishes were delicious as well.   For refreshments, I had the Jasmin-Hi, Umeboshi Sour, and Oolong-Hi.  Jasmin-Hi was Jasmine tea mixed with shochu, this drink was quite refreshing.  Umeboshi Sour consisted of salted plum, shiso, soda and shochu.  The crushed up plum cocktail was sweet and salty, it worked well as a digestif.  Oolong-Hi (Oolong tea x shochu) was also a delightful little drink.  For dessert I had a Taro Ice Cream, which was sprinkled with buckwheat tea on top.  The aromatic and crispy buckwheat tea really enhanced the sweetness of the taro ice cream.  We were offered some Kirakucho Tokubetsu Junmai Sake at the end of our marathon meal.  It was dry and silky, nicely balanced and went down smoothly.   Everyone enjoyed the meal and service at this hidden gem, would definitely come back to try out other dishes."}
{"text":"Lovely izakaya with tasty, good value dishes. Came by on a Saturday night with a large group and thankfully they took reservations because this place filled up fast. The simple wooden interiors gave it a really cozy feeling and I liked the detail for hanging coats along the wall. The staff were friendly and helpful, especially since a few of us had dietary restrictions. Overall the food was flavourful without being over seasoned and came in decent enough portions that we were pleasantly surprised by how deceptively tiny the plates seemed. Three of us shared the following dishes and were pretty full after - would recommend them all:  - Small Plates (~$7): Agedashi Eggplant, Corn Kakiage, Pork Cheek, Octopus, Mackerel - Meal ($15): Katsu Curry  Our party was a mixed bag with some people ordering individual meals and others sharing dishes within smaller groups, so shoutout to the staff for being bill splitting champs."}
{"text":"Cute japenese place. Mislieading from outside. food is well done, average, dont expect big portions."}
{"text":"This place is quite hard to find as it doesn't even have a sign lol wouldn't have known to come here unless my Japanese friend took me. Apparently the chef used to work at Kingyo for a few years and decided to open his own izakaya restaurant.  They have a lot of interesting selection of Japanese alcohol/drinks. They had a lot of different flavors of chu-hi cocktails. At other restaurants most places only have it mixed with fruit, but there they have it mixed with different teas (jasmine, oolong tea), or Aloe juice! Mixing alcohol with tea, interesting huh? I tried the Aloe-hi chu-hi cocktail which tasted just like aloe juice, I think they went light cause I couldn't really taste much alcohol.  Hamachi Sashimi ($15) Claimed to be fresh yellowtail from Japan. Came with 8 pieces of sashimi. I was surprised at first because normally here's some red color part of yellowtail, but i presume that this hamachi was a baby hamachi thats why it was pure white. The fish was so fresh though! The meat was super tender, I actually liked it a lot more than other hamachis that I've had.  Agedashi Eggplant ($6) Fried eggplant marinated in cold ginger dashi broth. I generally don't eat eggplant but my friends wanted to try so we had it. I did try a piece and it's not mushy at all and well seasoned so I actually didn't mind this dish.  Tebasaki ($7.5) This dish comes with 5 pieces of sweet garlic soya sesame nagoya style chicken wings. This was like Japanese version of honey garlic chicken wings. I really liked the sauce, felt like it was a combination of terriyaki and honey garlic. The chicken wings were slightly fried as it had a layer of crisp.  Tai Carpaccio ($14) Fresh Red Snapper slices with Yuzu citrus dressing topped with tomatoes and cilantro. This was quite a refreshing dish. The red snapper was fresh, thinly sliced and went well with the added toppings.  Anchovy Potato Salad & Chips ($6.6) When my friend wanted to order this I was like what?! Potato salad at a Japanese restaurant?! But this wasn't just any type of potato salad, it was actually Japanese style potato salad served on lettuce and topped with taro chips. You can eat the potato salad with the lettuce, or scoop it with the taro chips. It was good, but didn't stand out to me. Love the presentation though.  Corn Kakiage ($6.8) Essentially this is just corn tempura, but it was seasoned in salt. Simple, but tasty. Other places where I had it didn't come with salt and was just plain, so having the salt really complemented the corn - sweet and salty, with a crunch.  Curry Spring Rolls ($7) Curry flavored ground chicken and pork spring rolls. I was actually thinking the curry flavored would have been like Japanese curry, but no, this is just just usual curry flavor. Kinda reminded me of this Chinese Curry Pastry, tasted similar.   Saba Miso-ni ($9.5 for combo which comes with rice and miso soup) Mackerel lightly braised in miso ginger dashi broth. I was quite surprised that they gave a good amount of fish - 2 big pieces which is good considering most places probably would just serve you one small piece. The mackerel was well marinated and really flavorful - perfect to go with rice. You can also just order the fish only instead of the combo for $7.5  Nagoya Ramen ($9.8) Spicy chicken soup nagoya style ramen with ground pork and beef. This ramen had a nice kick, I really liked the soup. Came with thin noodles too which I prefer more than thick noodles. Was really tasty.  The menu is kinda small, and if you read the descriptions it seems like the menu items aren't that interesting but I was surprised for every dish in terms of quality and taste so don't let the menu fool you. Ordering so many little dishes does end up becoming quite pricey, but that goes for any kind of izakaya restaurant. I would say I really enjoyed the food and my experience here."}
{"text":"Hip and bright Japanese tapas spot, you'll never be so delighted to dine among other people's coats.   Pork Cheek - Excellent Corn dish - Brilliant, nice crunchy dish that maintains freshness of corn.  Katsu - Great Ramen - Bad Eggplant - Unreal Squid - Gunshots  West Dundas West af"}
{"text":"Amazing place with great food !! Highly recommend everyone check this place out. Really comfortable atmosphere, friendly service and awesome food! Try the fried chicken thighs!! My girlfriend and I will be making this place a regular stop for dinner"}
{"text":"We tried to drop by at Skippa the other night but were told that they were fully booked and ended up at Imanishi instead. Plates are izakaya style dishes (so fairly small) and prices are on the higher end, but the food is delicious and the atmosphere is super chill and relaxed.  The Monkfish Liver Pâté ($11) was served with four perfectly toasted baguette slices with some garlic on top. The pâté was rich and creamy with a intense flavour of cod roe.  Corn Kakiage ($7.50) - otherwise known as corn tempura - was a perfect balance of sweet and salty and probably one of my favourite dishes. The batter was incredibly light yet still crunchy and slightly salted and contrasted well with the sweet crunchy corn. I've tried the Kakiage from Menami but thought this one was far superior due to the more balanced batter to corn ratio (the one at Menami was over battered in my opinion) and overall sweeter flavour profile.  Yuzu Karaage ($9.20) was excellent. The chicken was fried perfectly with a light crispy batter that was not greasy in the least and super juicy inside. I loved the how the taste of yuzu was quite strong and gave the karaage a bold citrus taste. The kaarage comes with a side of yuzu pepper mayo and a wedge of lemon but honestly, it wasn't needed. The chicken was perfect on its own.  Finally, we tried the Wagyu Udon ($15) which was extremely well done. The noodles were tender, soft and wonderfully slurpy. The broth was rich with slightly sweet and sour notes and so addictively tasty that I drank it all!"}
{"text":"Dude, why don't you do something about the signage at the front of the restaurant that says the actual name of the place instead of something else?! That aside, if you manage to figure out where it's at, you will find yourself in a cool casual place to eat and have a few drinks.  Because it is small as well as busy, we ended up sitting at the bar area for dinner. The qualilty of the food was superb,  as well as the service.  However the dishes came in tapa sizes therefore you would have to order quite a few if you are hungry.  Unfortunately the price for most of these dishes are not cheap.  So for me, i have to think twice before going back there again."}
