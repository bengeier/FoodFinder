{"text":"My husband and I like to come here for happy hour -- not for the drinks but $7.50 burger and $7 \"frank-n-stein (substituting a soda for the beer). We came tonight, Friday, July 8, at 5:30 and found the place almost packed! By 6:00 people were waiting for a table or sitting outside. With misters running (and plenty of TVs), it must have been pretty pleasant. There was a wide age-range of people so it was welcoming regardless of one's age."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town!  We love this place!  Don't miss out on the opportunity to build your own burger while you are there.  Delicious!  Great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Our server was just a cold fish. Nothing fun and exciting about this place because of her. Food was fine...if you can't cook a burger..... I think if we had a better server we would have been more impressed."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago and a Blackhawks fan I decided to stop by this bar with my girlfriend to watch game 5 of the Stanley cup final.  We get to the front and there is maybe one other couple standing around.  Normally when going to bars in the Scottsdale area your greeted by a bouncer not a hostess, but I figured hey what the heck.  So as we approach the hostess the first thing she says to us is sorry there's a 2 and a half hour wait to get in.  We say 2 and a half hours ? well unfortunately we would have missed the game if we wanted to wait that long.  Supposedly her reasoning was because the bar area was too full ?  Never heard of such a thing in Scottsdale considering I've lived here for the last 5 years.  Looking in there was clearly enough room for at least another 50-75 people in the bar area.  Not only that but her tone when saying that was very rude and condescending.  I'm thinking to myself you know your not the only bar with the Blackhawks game right ? Lol  We took our business to bottled blondes where the service was top notch and people understand the concept of customer service and customer retention.  Very disappointed after hearing this was a Blackhawks bar.  Will never go here again.  I'll post a video to show you how \"full\" it was inside."}
{"text":"One of the few places chuckles hasn't reviewed, lol. 

Frankly an excellent burger, quality bun and fries worth the calories. The tots rock too. 

Eat here, you won't be disappointed. Also, a shout out to the bar staff, they are attentive and prompt"}
{"text":"I love the food at this place.  The variety is great.  There are so many things on the menu to try.  My favorite is the Buffalo chicken egg roles."}
{"text":"Fun spot!  One of the best veggie burgers ever!  But, deception alert, the \"small\" beer is the same size as the \"large\" beer, but the large is $1.50 more expensive.  The glass is shaped differently, but we tested the volume.  Same.  \"We cheat tourists and drunks?\""}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken fingers appetizer which was $10 by itself and asked for barbecue sauce with it. The chicken fingers were extremely dry, hard, and crunchy like they had been sitting out for days or over cooked. Even the barbecue sauce wasn't good, almost tasted like a strange sweet and sour sauce, definitely different. Overall I was not pleased and probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great patio to sit on! Mozzarella sticks are a must get! Staff was very nice!"}
{"text":"We loved our food and the service the first time we went, however our visits were not consistent. The second time we went the server mixed up our order and the food wasn't very good even though we ordered the same thing the first time. It's a fun place to grab a drink and some food when watching a game, but don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"Cold beers... Check... 

Good Service.... Check....



Attention to detail on the menu... Minus one star....

You can't list on happy hour local craft (assumably Phoenix metro area) and domestic drafts (which in the English language means drafts that are native to the United States) and still charge full price on items such as a lagunitas ipa (Petaluma California) and tell me domestics only include bud light, Coors light (about 200 miles farther away from Scottsdale than lagunitas brewery).    Revamp your menu with appropriate English.   Makes no sense."}
{"text":"I came with two girlfriends after shopping. One friend is a regular and she raves about this place so it's time I check it out. We went to the Scottsdale location. It was loud. Music blaring and lots of TVs everywhere with the Diamondbacks game on (which I enjoy). But it was a little hard to hear over the music and people trying to talk over it. 
For starters we shared a Mac-n-cheese dish with bacon and jalape√±os and....peas?! What's up with that?! My friend picked them out for me when I whined about how icky peas are lol. But it was still very tasty and I know how to order it next time. 
So we get our burgers, one friend had the Open Pit and the other had Ring of Fire. I had the Steakhouse-something with truffle oil on a pretzel bun. Ah-maz-ing. There was trouble with the Ring of Fire- my friend ordered it well done and it came out more undercooked than she could tolerate. Our server, Erin, was great! She apologized and promptly returned it. When the second one came out it still was undercooked but not as bad. A manager type came out and said he would comp her burger AND her beer. Wow! That is service. It wasn't necessary, and we made no scene about it. They fixed the burger and my friend enjoyed it but the gesture showed incredible commitment to customer satisfaction. Impressive. 
I cannot wait for the central Phoenix location to open!!!"}
{"text":"Nice brew selection with local options. Food was average with very generous portions. I ordered my burger medium and it was cooked to perfection. It wasn't extremely crowded so it was a disappointment that the waitress was slow and did not check on the table very much. It took forever to get the bill. The environment takes the cake. The weather was awesome today so sitting on the patio made the experience so much more enjoyable. There's a bunch of tvs so I would recommend this place if you want to go out for drinks and watch a game or fight."}
{"text":"This place kills it every time for me. The hangover burger or the open pit so fire! Great place"}
{"text":"Great patio and restaurant for big groups. They also have a lot of TVs for people who want to watch football. My burger and sweet potato tots were really good. I'm not sure the name of the burger I had maybe the truffle burger? Everyone that ate a burger in my group enjoyed it. I will definitely be back for another adult milkshake, the oreo milkshake with vodka and baileys is addicting, you could taste the alcohol just enough but it wasn't overpowering. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times and it's only been ok for both food and beers. Service has always been decent until today and I won't be back. I always visit three times before writing a review because I feel it's a more accurate and fair to the establishment. Today they officially lost me as a customer. I walk in and sit at the bar. There is a waitress speaking to a couple that was eating at the bar and a male bartender that was also part of the conversation. I wait because, hey they can't just leave a customer they are talking to because that would be rude. Seriously it would. However, behind the male bartender engaged in conversation is a female blond bartender texting that could have easily turned around to take my order. I waited a couple minutes and the male bartender didn't even acknowledge me. Not a glance, look, or \"be right with you sir.\"  The blonde never stopped texting. I walked out and will never go back, there's too many places to eat in this town that don't ignore you and appreciate your business. Also seriously blond bartender? Texting and ignoring a customer? Inexcusable. More inexcusable is the manager that's allowing it to happen in the first place."}
{"text":"Chill place to watch a game and grab a drink. The cheese burger sliders and the totchos are on point."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome Mac N Cheese! And I'm a Mac N Cheese  connoisseur. Had the Mac N Cheese Hot dog. Yummmm! 
4 stars because their menu doesn't offer any low-calorie options (like none) 
Be prepared to roll out of there."}
{"text":"This place is great for the weekends for game days. The food is consistently good and theres multiple tvs that cater to many games, and you're guaranteed to find something you like on the menu."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town! Great happy hour and lots of TVs to watch games on. Amazing beer selection and has beers from breweries in Arizona. Great environment and service."}
{"text":"Really fun neighborhood place, Im new to Arizona from San Diego and grateful to Yelp to find my way around to some good finds like these. Great energy of a local haunt with top notch eats such as the best Mac and Cheese I have ever had. Juicy, giant burgers. I flipped over the local brew Papago Orange blossom. The friendly Service as good as the food. I am now a loyal regular!"}
{"text":"$5 off if you check in on the yelp app!

We came here kind of late after the place had already died down a lot. We chose to sit on the patio and the service was pretty slow the entire night when it came to drink refills and such. I asked the server if they had reverse happy hour and she said no but I swore I saw it on the website or a review so she checked again and it turns out they did. My fiance enjoyed the beer selection. 

I got the truffle burger and it was really really good. I tried both the fries and chips for sides and they both had really tasty seasoning. I liked the chips better though.My fiance got the rocky point burger and raved about it. 

The food gets a 4.5 but the service kind of sucked. Not horrible but unattentive. I want to come back for trivia nights on thursday but am a little scared due to how the service was on a really slow night."}
{"text":"Great place if you love a variety of beers, plus for those of you who are up for a challenge, there is a burger challenge...check it out!"}
{"text":"What a beer selection...35 plus on draft, 50 plus cans and bottles...that's over 85 different beers to drink. Then add a awesome burger and food selection, this place is going to rock it in old town! There are several flat screen TV's to watch all your favorite games on. The patio  (The biggest on Scottsdale road) I think, is totally awesome and inviting. If you are in old town and craving some food, this is the place to stop!"}
{"text":"Juicy Lucy is my tie for best burger in Scottsdale next to rehab burger therapy in old towns mcgnarly burger. The fries are better at cbcb and they have more beer so that's a big plus."}
{"text":"Been here while on vacation and on business. If you want cold beer and over the top burgers, this place is for you. Eat inside, eat outside, eat at the bar. Fun atmosphere, plenty of TV's, music. What's not to like? Think outside the box and try one of their \"different\" burger selections. Good messy fun! Really good beer selection also. Thoroughly enjoyed my three different visits here."}
{"text":"Me and a few of my buddies visited Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers Sunday night for a bite to eat and a few beers. 
 
To start off, the service was Great! Our waitress Caylee was Amazing. She was very nice, she knew everything on the menu to answer questions, and she was very personable.

I ordered the Blue Cheese burger and it was the BEST burger ive had in a long time. My friends were also very happy with their meals. The beer was also very cold and delicious.

My experience was a definite 5 start experience and I found my new favorite burger joint."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers!! Delicious and made to order. Drinks are on point. Cute bar ambiance with friendly customer service and managers greeted me with a smile. For a bar, it will exceed expectations and the beer and burgers won't disappoint you."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere to watch a game with plenty of tvs and outside seating. The burgers are pretty good and there are lots of options. The sides are actually really good as well and they come in generous portions. While I wouldn't come here for a nice dinner it is a great place to grab a beer and watch a game."}
{"text":"Pretty standard sports style bar. Loud with lots of TVs on the wall. Nice bar that was open to a patio on the street. Food was decent & staff was friendly. Good local beer choices."}
{"text":"Welcome to Scottsdale Road!!!
Went in this establishment at 1:30pm today hoping for a great expirience, left here 20 minutes later with not so much as a peep or eye contact recognizing us. Could it be I had my Canadian flag t-shirt on? Or could it be that I'm African American could it be I'm African American and my girlfriend is white? I doubt it was either one of those myself. All I know is I sat on the north side of their patio for 20 minutes without so much as being acknowledged. Secondly there were about seven or eight dogs on their patio and I'm pretty sure that's not kosher with the health department. So alot little disappointed in a place that everyone told me to go to and was going to have a good time. The servers there (on the patio) seemed extremely snotty and uptight, manager wasn't that much better, hostess went out of her way for us. Sbe careful of a time and day you go but Saturdays at 1-30 in the afternoon obviously was not the time to go today. If I could give him 10 stars I would because your patio service was horrendous. Just because your location is awesome doesn't mean your service can be well below par. People still notice and want good service. You should educate your staff on awareness.
Arbys two blocks away was much better. (Service)"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Fantastic beer selection and a tremendous choice of large screen TVs to choose from."}
{"text":"I will preface by saying this was the first time i was disappointed a lot. Management doesnt really care.

A lunch ordered was placed with Chelsea. Went perfect. We sent someone to the restaurant to pick up our order. When i received the order one burger 2ass not properly made to order. I phoned back and spoke to Chelsea told her what happened. Asked if someone can run over the correct burger. I was placed on hold and i think i spoke to Carl. He told me he did not have the staff to do that. I asked how he planned to remedy the situation. He said i have a couple of questions. Can you remove the lettuce and tomatos. I said no thats why i need a new sandwich. Plus Carl being such a genius if i could remove it i would have never spent the time to call. 

Next course of action was to refund me the price of the burger. I said ok. Where Carl lacks the knowledge is we order a lot from there. He has lost a lot of lunch order business from my company.

When you have  that sort of attitude for remedying a situation you go out of your way to make things right.

Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers lacks the professionalism for a upsacle burger place."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight for the first time after hearing about it from several sources. I was intrigued by the description of hell chips on the appetizer menu. I normally love buffalo sauce and eat it with burgers, Mac n cheese, cheese crisps etc. but these chips were so drenched in it that they weren't even crunchy when they arrived at the table. After a few chips, my water was gone and couldn't find our waitress for a refill. When she returned we asked for a side of ranch to eat the chips. Burger was ok but nothing so special to go back for. I'd rather go to red robin for a better burger and fresher bun. Then I could get free fry refills too. Too many other places to pick from in the area."}
{"text":"My ranking of the establishment doesn't rank my most recent experience. This place is a great place to grab that cheat day hamburger that we all need at least once a week. They've got a full menu of very different and very delicious burgers. They have simple ones, HUGE ones and also nice, \"healthy\" burgers too. 

Of course, they have many beers (very good beer) available, local domestic and imported. 

It is called cold beers and cheeseburgers after all. And you can't go wrong with either. 

--
But my most recent experience was a little lackluster on the service department. Our waitress was no where to be found when I needed some ranch dressing for my mozzarella sticks and also when I wanted to pay the bill.  She was enthusiastic while talking with us, however those times were few and far between. 

Great place though, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went to this place the first time, ordered my burger medium and got a well done burger. Boo! Thought I'd give it a second chance and went a second time. Ordered my burger medium rare and got it medium. My husband ordered his medium and got well done. My mother in law ordered the sliders and they were burnt. Look, if you're going to have a restaurant that specializes in burgers then know how to cook your burgers!! Really disappointing. Will never go again and will be sure to tell everyone I know not to go."}
{"text":"It's a great place with a patio. We went for happy hour, good food & beer. However, happy hour is canceled all month due to Spring Training. That's my only complaint. Wish I would have know prior. It's advertised on the menu as you walk by. I wasn't told until I got my bill. I would have built my own mac an cheese instead of appetizers...."}
{"text":"Went with my buddies last night.  Had an order if wings.  We ordered all three sauces and the mixed them together by accident.  They ended up giving us another 12 free made with the sauces separate.both wings were good.  We had burgers they were excellent.  Great place to watch the game.  Good beer n burgers."}
{"text":"I have a tendency to find something and stick with it.  I don't like change, and I especially don't like trying new things.  This was recommended to me a four months ago, so I had a business lunch here, reluctantly.  

The first thing I noticed was the large amount of big screens, then, the music playing was Iration and the place was spotlessly clean.  Being a stickler for cleanliness and consistency in food, I was hopeful this would not be a disappointing venture.  

Erin (the bartender) was incredibly helpful in deciding what to try, and introduced me to my new favorite beer (Maui Coconut Porter).  Poor service can ruin the best of meals, hence I can't say enough about her professional and positive demeanor.  She exudes the highest of service, and makes everyone feel comfortable.  Her attentive nature and impeccable timing make dining here a very pleasant experience even when the rail is full, you will never find yourself waiting, and she somehow is able to stock the bar in between her customers, service bar, and even running food. 

It's now three months later and I had almost tried each burger save for the O-Lineman, and then they updated the menu.  Needless to say, I was coerced into trying the new PB&J Bacon Burger, and it was a heavenly, sticky mess of goodness.  I highly recommend the food, and have never met a lunch I didn't love.  (Besides, they are incredibly insistent that you're happy with your food)

I look for any excuse to eat here when I'm traveling South.  I can say it is my new, go-to lunch eatery."}
{"text":"It's very disappointing when you want to try something new and the place you want to try ends up being the worst in town. I didn't even bother eating because after we were sat not one server or manager said a thing to us. Didn't bring us waters or even greet us. After 20 minutes of waiting I noticed lots of servers and even manager just standing around socializing paying no attention to their paying customers. Poor customer service, come on get it together guys. For having heard such good things I was extremely disappointed and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying I have NEVER been so disrespected in my life!!! My husband  and I have been here many times and have had decent service, but this time was so upsetting and unforgivable. The 6 of us were there last night 9/3 to watch the opening of college football and we didn't have a problem until we were seated in a side booth against the wall with no air! After that, the problems kept coming. We were served with ice water that tasted like chlorine, but I was the only one that kindly asked our server for another water because it tasted funny and she proceeded to give me a nasty look. Funny thing is, I thought the customer is always right, but I got the dirty look! Silly me. After 20 minutes of waiting for clean water, she forgot my husbands and our friends beer and never asked us if we were ready to give our order. That is until she was done flirting with the table of men behind us.   The hostess took my name and number down so we could move to a bigger table once the rest of our party arrived. Finally after 30 minutes later, I checked to see if a table opened up since we were never notified. Finally we were moved to a more comfortable table surrounded by other tables competing for the TV's. My husband KINDLY asked one of the managers (Which there were two male managers working that night. Both wearing glasses and obese) if he could turn on the Gopher game, and the managers response was very rude by saying he doesn't know if there's an open box to change the channels. After 30 minutes had gone by and still no game, we asked the same manager again and he just brushed us off. Finally they turned the channel after almost 40 minutes. WOW. After I thought the service couldn't get any worse, our friend noticed there was a HUGE piece of glass at the end of his glass and felt something funny in his throat. We immediately called our server over to show her the glass. She took it and brought the other male manager over. He apologized to our friend and offered him a $5 gift card for his next visit. REALLY??!?! a $5 gift card for swallowing glass!!!???? You've got to be kidding! We were furious! The manager came back to our table with a \"Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers\" basic business card that didn't even have his name on it! He proceeded to ask over and over again \"What do you want me to do about it?\" Seriously!! Our friend was headed to the emergency room, but the manager insisted it wasn't his problem even though he explained to us how the glass could have gotten in there. \"When the bartenders stack the glasses together, a piece of glass from the bottom came off causing it to lay on the bottom unnoticed,\" he said. That is till someone swallows it!! HOW HORRIBLE!!!! The manager bumped up the price of the gift cards and insulted us with two $10 ones that can ONLY be used for the next visit, even though none of us will be back here AGAIN! If that wasn't bad enough, my husband and I proceeded to walk out and he politely went over to the manager, who insulted us with the gift cards,  to express his feeling about our experience there and the manager blew up! He started coming at my husband in an aggressive way and kept saying, \"What do you want me to do!!\" We were disgusted with how this guy had handled everything! We have NEVER been treated so poorly as a paying customer. The manager acted like it was our fault for letting him know how bad our service was! I walked over when I saw the manager getting in my husbands face and told him how bad our service was and how horrible they handled our friend swallowing glass! At that point, he continued to get aggressive with both of us and one of the black bouncers came over and and tried to restrain the manager. You know the manager has a problem when their own bouncer is restraining him. I continued to say, we will never be back here again and I'm calling their corporate to them them know how horrible we were treated and how disgusting their managers are. Both the managers LAUGHED in my face when I said that! Then the black bouncer put it hands on me to shove me out! My husband had to tell him to take his hands off me. We were the victims here!! We will NEVER be back here again and I hope when their management reads this they will be more selective when hiring appropriate staff because they should be ashamed of themselves!!"}
{"text":"Sliders are the best! Burgers look good, but sliders have the bun to burger ratio perfect. Sweet (potato) Tots were perfect, especially if you ask for ailoi mayo. Onion rings look good, but the fries were quite forgettable (replace them with something else).   Salad was a nice size and the Chili dog was tasty and plenty large. Wish we could have tried more!"}
{"text":"I visited Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers on March 2, 2015. This is nothing new considering this is one of my favorite spots to dine. I live in Glendale so it is quite a drive but it was always worth it until my most recent visit. I sat at the bar between 3:00 and 4:30 p.m. with my boyfriend. The bartender was female and was a tall skinny brunette. My boyfriend and I both ordered a beer so naturally she asked for our ID's. She checked my boyfriends first and gave it back and then asked for mine. I gave her my ID and she proceeded to ask for a second form so I gave her a card with my name and mentioned that I had a school picture ID as well. The bartender then walks away and goes to talk to the manager. The manager them comes and walks around the bar with my ID in his hand trying to sneakily look at me. A few minutes later the bartender comes back and tells me she and her manager do not think that I'm the person in the ID and that she will not be serving me. I am now in shock because it is in fact me and I had 5 other forms of ID on me. Not to mention, the manager took one glance at me rather than trying to match my facial features to the ones in the ID. I work in the industry as a server and bartender in fact I only work about a block away. I understand she was trying to do her job but there was absolutely no reason for her to decline my ID and tell me that it isn't me. I was even more upset that after this the manager didn't come over and speak to me nor did the bartender ever come back with my boyfriend's drink or to offer us food. This bartender was extremely rude and had terrible customer service as well as the manager on duty at that time. As someone who has worked in the industry for 6 years I have never seen this poor of customer service. This is sad considering they have great drinks and food. I also worry because around this time people are coming into town for spring training and are going to be awfully disappointed when this bartender turns down their ID because she deems it as fake."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for lunch in Oldtown. Wednesday is build your own burger. Also, the Mac and cheese is amazing."}
{"text":"I brought my wife in here for a few drinks and we shared some of the tots. Amazing! our server was Kerri and she was terrific. very friendly and personable from the get go. she recommended the tots and paired me a beer with it. that was really nice, because most servers couldnt even tell you whats oj the menu let alone make a good oairing suggesstion. I've been in the industry for a while and she's what i would call a killer. I'd definitely come back with my boys to watch some football!"}
{"text":"Nice place to go late night for us. We have been a few times to watch the games or play trivia, or just hang out. I love the food and the variety of burgers you can create!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great service!!! This place rocks especially for sporting events!!! Tons of flat screens everywhere! Definitely have a Bloody Mary at the do it ur self Bloody Mary bar!! Best I've ever had! Gotta be the bacon....beyond amazing!!!! If I lived closer I'd be a regular for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and fantastic appetizers and the service was quick and efficient. Wish we had one in northern Az! I liked the beer choices even though they changed out an IPA for the summer Shandy  (gross) otherwise seemed to have a great selection! I do think a nice have a good night or see ya later from host or any of the crew would have made this a 5 star review, but I work in the service industry so i am a little picky!"}
{"text":"This place is a disaster. Let's start with standing around for 25 minutes while we are next on the list while there are 5 open tables. Now it was 630 on a Wednesday so I'm fine with waiting for a table, just not when there are 5 empty ones which we are eventually seated at. Our server comes promptly to take drinks, returns again and we order our meals, the build your own burger and a grayhawk club. 45 minutes later the burger comes out nicely cooked, unfortunately missing 5 out of the 8 topping asked for.  My buddies club is heavy on the butter and slathered with mayo, he couldn't stomach more than half of it. Our drinks go empty and would remain that way for the rest of the meal. As we sat there trying to wave down our server, not to mention what looked to be the manager who was wandering around chatting up the customers and clearing empty plates, we were ignored to the point that we walked up to the bar and asked for our check. This was my second time there as it is very convenient, and this experience puts the nail in the coffin for me. I wanted this place to be good as I'm a cheeseburger fiend, but it wasn't to be. I have never posted on Yelp, but I do use it quite often and felt obligated to make my first post. This place is a joke. Food is mediocre at best, service is some of the worst I've had."}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered a Four Peaks Sunbru along with the Deep South hot dog with fries on the side. Absolutely delicious! I normally like my hot dogs plain but this one was amazing. Awesome service and tons of TV's so you are never out of a view of the game that's on. Great happy hour menu and it's every day! Tried this place on a whim but will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Just flew into town and wanted to watch the football games at a good bar.  they did not disappoint.  Needed a table for 7 and they were able to seat us in 20 min on Sunday afternoon while the games were on.  Service was excellent.  The waitress split are tab, b/c it is always a pain paying a tab when people have been drinking.  High recommend it.  
Also the ladies that frequent the joint are not sore on the eyes."}
{"text":"What a great time ordered the O Lineman which was the best Cheeseburger I have ever had. Ayla our server was fantastic and Luis the Manager showed true Hospitality. I will be back. Great food Great Beer selection and Great Service."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant was great! But the service was absolutely atrocious. Out waitress did not tell us anything about the menu, like the fact that you can build your own burger or mac and cheese (which we found later laying on the table), and we only saw our waitress twice.  She took our drink orders, our food orders, and then we never saw her again.  We had to bring our check up to the manager, because we could not find out waitress.  I am a firm believer that service is a huge part of a restaurant experience! Since the food was great, I would give it one more chance but thats it!"}
{"text":"Super fun place to watch any sports! Great beer selections!!!! They have some pretty cool beer flights options too! Gotta try it! Had the thousand island burger, it was great! Really juicy and moist. The onion rings were good. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Best Sports Bar with the best food in my opinion.   NFL Sundays are crazy packed but that adds to the vibe.  Can't wait to spend some March Madness here as well."}
{"text":"Has decent food and a nice beer selection. Burgers are huge. Music was a little loud, but not a problem. But then nickleback came on."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing beer selection!! Quick service, plenty of seating both inside and outside, and decent pricing."}
{"text":"We returned to this fun place recently, and my GF and I both ended up with food poisoning -- presumably from the cole slaw, the only fresh item we both ate. GF ended up in the Emergency Room for a day and left with over $1,000 in medical bills. She called a few days later just to let them know (this should NEVER happen to a restaurant patron), they seemed concerned, took her name and number, and promised she'd be hearing from their General Manager.  A week later, no call back. They're busy enough that they just don't care. Bad food prep, bad food safety practices, and bad customer retention efforts. We won't be back."}
{"text":"worst.service.ever.

I was so excited to try this place out - I mean the name alone contains two of my favorite things, how could this go wrong? I went here with my husband and another couple on 8/15. We were seated quickly on the patio around 7pm. We sat there for about 15 minutes and no one came to our table... I thought \"OK, no big deal, we'll get a round of beers at the bar and then our server will be around to help us with food soon.\" Another 20 minutes goes by, no server. We asked the table next to us if they had been served, their answer: NO. Long story short, we were at this place from 7-930 and not one single server came up to our table, ever. We had to go up to the bar and order all our food and drinks. It's too bad because the burgers were good, and they did have some pretty decent beers on tap. But, come on!!! Service is key!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! You know exactly what you are getting here: the best burgers and quality craft beer.

What I love about this place is the emphasis they put on making the food amazing. I feel most bars but too much emphasize on the beer the food suffers, but that is not the case here! Definitely get the burger and do a beer flight!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed it so much on a Saturday afternoon, we went back a week later.  My husband and I are not drinkers but we love our hamburgers. The first time we were there was during hamburger month and I had the Philly Burger with au jus. Loved it. Great flavor, cooked just right, au jus made it pretty special. The next time Hubby and I both had the bacon blue burger, not sure if that is the name, it was scrumptious. Onion rings for me fries for hi. Shared them both and man, were they good. Sat on the patio, misters worked great, fun to people watch not only the patrons but the people on the street.wait staff did a very good job. Kept my tea filled. All was good both times. Now, is the restaurant by the same name north on Scottsdale rd. the same company and will it be as good?"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and beer selection. Love the Build Your Own Burger option especially on Wednesdays for $10!"}
{"text":"Ok..this is my first review and after my experience, I was compeled. This review is for the greyhawk location...I'll start first with the service....well there really wasn't any at all..upon entering, there is a sign that states a hostess will seat you but there is no one there...after about 6 min. (I timed it) she wandered out from the back and seated my wife and I...the gal behind the bar came out to take our order...I had forgot to add something and looked around only to see her heading out the door with her purse!! no mention to us that she was leaving or that anyone else would be attending to us...2 other servers (if you could call them that) asked us if anyone had taken our order..I said yes but she left and we didn't know who was taking care of us...no real response...finally, our food came..I had the Jucy Lucy burger and my wife had the turkey dipper...burger was ok, but under cooked (ordered med, it was med-rare) no real big deal but NO ONE ever came back to check on us or I would have asked for it to be cooked a bit more (needless to say, half of it went in the trash) for 10 bucks, I expected more...My wife's turkey dipper was terrible..the turkey was mushey and had no texture at all and had a very peppery taste to it...the dipping gravy had the consistency of milk and of course...NO ONE around to say anything about it to..... I honestly think Dennys could have done a better job on the dipper........at one point. there were NO employees or a manager anywhere to be found in the restaurant as they were all in the back..the bartender was actually sitting in an office chair in a back room!!!! This all during the lunchtime service... I had to get up and go find someone to get my bill....Iwhen I finally found someone, I asked where the server was and his response was \"in the back rolling knapkins\" ...this place needs a wakeup call if they think that they are ever going to survive in this market full of competition....It seems like it is just a big ship sailing with no captain or anyone in charge that acts like they give a shit about the customers.......this was my second trip to this location and also my last. I will seek out somewhere else to spend my hard earned money where they understand the meaning of service...."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! Great beer and super fantastic perfect amount of creaminess to my mac and cheese. I created my own Mac n cheese as it was on special that day and wow it turned out great...Loaded with grilled chicken breast strips broccoli mushrooms- they did not cheap out! Honestly the best Mac n cheese of my life. It really was mmm mmm mm. 
Our server was very friendly, bubbly and helped me decide with so much patience."}
{"text":"Great spot to just come and grab a quick drink while waking down Scottsdale Rd in Old Town. Great vibes and beers!"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst service and experience I have ever received. First was not getting my order for 45 minutes when I'm seeing other tables get their orders. The waitress tried to say there was backup in the kitchen. I ordered a beer, and waited. After 15 minutes, my waitress passed by, I try to make eye contact. I think I did, but another 10 minutes of waiting, I get my beer with an excuse of \"backup at the bar.\" I'm not buying that at all. Then, while the game was going, I kept getting bumped and pushed from where I was sitting. I almost wanted to ask the table next to me if they were having the same issue, but I was already frustrated at that point. This place came so highly recommended and it failed to deliver in any facet."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fantastic and the service is great. Always packed for football on Sunday, and very fun."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Service was ok. Food was just ok. 

Our waitress which was some long haired blonde girl (I can't think of her name) recommended a burger that she swears was the best on the menu and it was most definitely the worst burger I have ever had. It tasted gamey and weird and the combination of toppings was strange. Our waitress was attentive enough but kindof rude. Probably won't be back. They have cold beer and cheeseburgers other places."}
{"text":"Great service from waitress!! Great food! Only complaint is the snotty hostesses! If I based it on first impressions and not the food or waitress, it would have been 1/2 star!!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was just okay to me. Server was friendly enough, we were just in and out for lunch so there wasn't much more I'd ask of her than drink refills and to check that the food was up to par. My juicy lucy burger lacked any juiciness and I searched and searched for that cheese. It was not there and maybe after pulling the whole burger apart looking for it my plate looked too odd to ask how the food was? I don't really know but after all the great things I had heard I was expecting to have found a new place for a good burger. Definitely not the case. Maybe the beer is extra extra cold? They do always seem busy and I just don't get it....rehab is much better and right up the street!"}
{"text":"The burgers were great, but then again they should be since your paying a premium price for a burger. That being said, I think charging an upgrade for a small bucket (and it was small) of tator tots or French fries from the standard homemade potato chips is kind of ridiculous, since your already paying premium prices for the meal. I mean really, the deal should be your choice of potato for no extra charge. Mentioned this to the manager and his response was \"dually noted\", which is code for \"sucks to be you.\" Then he said he would let the chef know, like the chef would have a say in the matter."}
{"text":"I've eaten in the restaurant many times and have loved the food and service. Ordered through Door Dash - half the order was missing; as was their customer service. I love delivery but if they don't represent your quality or brand it's not worth it.

The restaurant and their staff made it right... These guys are first class."}
{"text":"Food was decent but the customer service was really bad.  Never saw a wait and bar staff so lacking in personality and unwillingness to smile and be pleasant.  It was bizarre."}
{"text":"I would've rated it higher if it didn't take them 20 minutes to give me and my wife two cheeseburgers and fries. They have at least 20 TVs and were just showing golf and such that nobody was really watching. I definitely expected more."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! Lettuce warped turkey burger and sweet potato tots are delicious! Service is so so but a great place to watch the game!"}
{"text":"Great beers, wonderful service and the BEST turkey burger I've ever had!!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As a tourist who came here in March, I was very disappointed.  We came for lunch, and granted it was busy, it took forever to get served.  The waitress didn't even pay attention to us.  Her mom came in by the bar, and the waitress was talking to her mom for a while. My wife and I figured that the snookie type of waitress must not care about tourists or a tip..  Coming from the Chicago suburbs, I now realize that we have much better establishments in the Chicago suburbs, b/c this wasn't the only bad restaurant we went to.  If you're a tourist, you would think that Shotgun Betty's would be the trashiest, but that was actually the only place that treated us well."}
{"text":"This place is straight fire! Great burgers, great service, & plenty of flat screens to watch sporting events. Oh, & did I mention the beer selection is dope! So many beers to choose from I didn't know where to start. Whether you're a beer enthusiast or just a casual beer drinker, you'll be satisfied. And shout out to our awesome server Keri who absolutely killed it!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Great burgers, terrific sweet potato tots! Service with a smile! Only draw back.....really loud! If your looking for a fun, tasty place to go, this is it! If your looking for conversation,  find another place! :)"}
{"text":"Was raving about this place to my uncle and brother visiting from out of state. Great beer and amazing burgers. Once we get there it was a different story. Very slow and poor service, wasn't even busy. Manager came out and turned down their ID because it was from out of state. Bull. Now worries, place next door was awesome and ended up turning our night around."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, after debate on where to go (other places closed). Great and quick service! Food was very good (love that we can create own burger). The manager stopped by to make sure orders came out correctly and ensured we received 10% discount from Yelp. Definitely coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Not bad, but the beer should be colder given the name.  They need a line chiller.  Had much colder beers many places.  Great selection of beers though."}
{"text":"Fun, fun, fun for Spring Training and March Madness. Food is better than average. Good crowd. Service strong."}
{"text":"3.5 stars 4 for sports bar. 
Friendly staff good wings burger.. It's a sports bar for god sake.."}
{"text":"Patio is a perfect place to watch the game! Lots of tvs. Fans outside for hot days. Hot dogs are my go to but they say I need to try the PB&J burger next time. Water bowls for me and my buddies. Would give 1 star to the woman that stepped on my friend's paw as she walked by and didn't apologize."}
{"text":"Casual sports bar with good outdoor seating.  Buffalo chicken sliders were very good and had a kick!  Fortunately the beer was also cold as advertised!  Not exactly a dive, but a great spot to escape the upscale Scottsdale vibe."}
{"text":"Best $8.00 20 OZ  and shot deal in town! Great food and big portions! Love all the s and sports on them! An old town favorite! Best sports  bar in old town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Michigan fans beware!! This is a Buckeye-owned bar - don't be surprised if you come in wearing maize and blue and your food tastes a little funny. :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great atmosphere and excellent burgers. They have an amazing Rocky Point burger that I highly recommend. This is a great spot to go for any game day as well. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Limited menu, poor service, poor service....did I say poor service?  Could not beg a waitress for help on Sunday afternoon, they were about 3/4 full, not packed by any means.  Finally got someone to bring me a drink after about 30 mins.  Lots of empty tables for the 90 mins we were there but they were all \"reserved\".  No one actually ever sat in those seats, when we left the place was pretty empty.  Accidentally ran my card for $250 and my actual $20 bill.  Could not get anyone on the phone today for help.  Been calling all day.  Regardless, when a place is run this poorly on the front end, no way its being run well behind the scenes.  Food selection was plain, no signature dish to come here for.  My burger and pretzels were average for bar food.  You wanna watch a game or have a nice evening out, plenty of better places in old-town."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great beer, great atmosphere. The staff is amazing. Count on me being a regular!"}
{"text":"I feel like something is missing here and I can't put my finger on it. This place is ok I think bungalow has better burgers. I have wanted to love this place cause it has such a cool name but the 3x I have been here I felt uncomfortable after I ate. The portions are good and I'm not a big fatso who can't stop eating. There is just something strange about this place. Push comes to shove I'd certainly go here again but lol the way I feel after is certainly strange."}
{"text":"Food was ok - except for the green tomatos but the service was just blah.....nothing really wrong but just not fun. Maybe on a football night. Interesting thing with the tator tots and chili - the guac seemed like it was from a can."}
{"text":"Delicious burger! We really enjoyed the food here when we were in town for the UCLA Football game.  It is very noisy inside."}
{"text":"First off, a burger and fries only was $15. This would be okay, if the burger was actually good!  I drank 48 ounces of water since dinner just to try to counter the copious amounts of salt in their food! This is also NOT a good place to try to have a coversations with someone.  It was way too loud, and my ears were numb when I left.  Don't even bother upgrading your bun to a pretzel bun, you will be seriously disappointed.  I would maybe rate a 2 if the bun was better. We tried it, and now, I honestly have no desire to go back. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Love this place. More beers than you can imagine. My burger was cooked to perfection. The wait staff was personable and attentive."}
{"text":"No complaints whatsoever. From the staff to the food to the atmosphere, it was all great. Typical sports bar and grill with ample patio seating. Hostess was prompt with us, then our waitress was a sweetheart and was the perfect amount of catering, the manager swung by to see if everything was alright and it certainly was! The burgers are perfectly done here, whether building your own or trying one of the menu preparations, you can't go wrong. The fries are also great here - thick, crispy yet fluffy goodness. Happy hour prices are awesome as well. I will be coming back multiple multiple times not only so I can fill out my punchcard on their app, but because there is an experience here you simply cannot replicate! I'm not one to hand out 5 stars willy nilly, but this establishment earned all five. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you have \"cheeseburger\" in the name of your business... You should probably be good at making a cheeseburger..  Over cooked, stale bun and waaaaay over priced... Never going back."}
{"text":"The place is quite lively ... They quite a selection beers on tap  and canned beers.We ordered the burgers and some beers. Food was ok and service was ok too. Our host and server were friendly though."}
{"text":"Arrived from Ohio hungry. Beer selection is good with lots of local crafts. Burgers looked big so we shared one and it worked well for two years us. Would recommend the Bacon Blue with caramelized onions and avocado.  Mid-day it wasn't busy so service was good. Coleslaw was very good also."}
{"text":"This place is really fun!  It is in a great location, the atmosphere is very comfortable without seeming too sports bar-ish, the beer list is gigantic and the food is awesome.  This is one of my favorite places to hang out in old town, and they serve food late which is good because I work late."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and atmosphere is great! 
Had the staple Mac and Cheese it was creamy and delicious! 1000 island burger is incredible! Will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"First timer. Place was packed (like normal on a Friday). Sat at the bar and got prompt service from our bartender ordered a burger with fries quite possibly the best burger ever. I hope it's like that all time. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great cheeseburgers (would've been bad if those were no good). Great atmosphere. Nice bartenders."}
{"text":"The food is good, but not the service.  Went for lunch and waited way too long for our food. The waitress never refilled our drinks.  When we finished our meal she continued setting the tables and did not bring our check.   Finally after waiting for 20 minutes, I walked up to the bartender and manager for the check.   Btw, they went chatting and laughing the whole time and could care less about customers needs.  Not a fan of this place!"}
{"text":"Ambiance - sports bar and very loud. 

Food - one if the best burgers I've ever had! Lots of tater tot option which are all awesome.  

Drink - Mimosas on Sunday were killer and a huge beer selection.

It certainly lives up to it's name."}
{"text":"I went there twice already.

The first time they screw my order up so I had a regular burger with fries. (I ordered a Juicy Lucy). I also tried the asparagus. 

The burger was good although a little over cooked (I ordered it medium). The fries were good.

The asparagus were super oily and not that great.

The second time I really wanted to try the Juicy Lucy, so I ordered it again. I also ordered a side of Mac n' Cheese and the kid sliders.

They didn't ask me how I wanted my burger cooked, but it came like medium well. The cheese was a mirage and no cheese taste at all. Good meat taste but disappointing outcome with the cheese fiasco.

The mac n' Cheese was barely OK, super fatty and nothing to make me crave it ever again.

The kid sliders were a weird construction with a cold bun, cold cheese and well done patties. The cheese wasn't melted or even warm.

French fries were OK.

I would go back if I'm in the neighborhood but it's not a place that I would be craving at all.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Eh... just ok.. nothing special....wouldn't recommend or come again... we had burgers and chips and the chips were the best part... my wine was undrinkable....(yelapa cab).... hubby's beer was very good and cold... vanilla stout. ... service was ok... she was very busy and was very pleasant.... ambiance was nice too..."}
{"text":"I really like this location: the atmosphere is great and the food is delicious. They always over quote the wait time, so be patient, it usually won't be as long as they say. Definitely a great lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Great The juicy Lucy and all-American burger amazing.  They were extra cheese and thick.  Also had the tots that were good not excellent.  Great spot to watch traffic and people go bye.   Cost reasonable I would deathly recommend.  Great beer selections and service was great."}
{"text":"I love this place. Open patio, perfect location, and always lively. If I have an open night on the weekend, this is my go to spot. There are always friendly people to interact with and sports on the flat screen. Also, the fries are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Food was extremely sub-par and pricey for what you got.  Everything about the place was just average.  There are a ton of TV's, a decent beer list, and very basic burgers.  If that's what you're looking for, this place is great.  If you're looking for a great burger, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch and ordered the Steakhouse Truffle Burger a Build Your Own Burger and a couple of beers.  Both burgers were cooked just right and had great flavor, but the Steakhouse burger was incredible!  The house made chips and onion rings were decent, but very heavy on the salt.  The service was pretty good; very friendly, but our server was kind of in a daze.  Everyone seemed busy and they were all helping each other out so overall the service was decent.  All in all it was a very solid lunch and we'd probably go back for the burgers."}
{"text":"So I came to this place for a work happy hour, and after looking at the menu, I knew I want to come back for lunch or dinner and boy I'm glad I did.  I first stopped by this place and met some co-workers for drinks.  We didn't order any food, but there were several items that caught my eye and I knew next time I came I would order them!

So I came about couple of weeks later.  My wife and i wanted a burger, sandwich, or some hearty type of meal, so i knew this would be the perfect place.  The first time I came here i saw some awesomeness that had to do with tater tots and found out they were called Original Tot chos.  My wife and I split that, she also ordered the All American, and I decided to go all out and get the O-Linemen.  The food and service was awesome.  The Tot chos were on point, very similar to nachos of course, but without the chips.  My wife's burger was great and mine was awesome.  I pounded about half the sandwich, it was even a little too much for me.  As you can see from the photo's, bring your appetite cause the food is very filling.  The prices were very reasonable and the food was delicious.

This place is great to watch games or hangout for drinks, also a nice place to take your lady for some good food.  I know there are several locations across the valley, give this place a try, it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great hamburgers and overall bar food. The service is spot on. Something to be said nowadays."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and food has been good (love the Mac and cheese) but service lacking....tried again yesterday and got seated right away, waited about 5 minutes for server to stop by.  Ordered a coke and a water while waiting for our friend to join us and 20+ minutes later still no water or coke or a return to see what the 3rd person wanted.  Seems our server was too busy with another table to help anyone else as she kept returning to same table while never even making eye contact with our table or even stopping by with our drinks.  Walked out and told hostess that the wait was too long.  I've been a server...it certainly doesn't take much more than making sure ALL your tables are being served.  Really wish the service would improve, not sure I'd go back at this point."}
{"text":"I come here often becuase I live and work in the Old Town area. The food is always good but the service can be a hit or miss. 

And when I say the service can be a hit or miss, it's usually a miss. Granted... this place has a really cool atmosphere and is perfect for watching any sport you could think of, so I understand the waitstaff can be slammed at times. However, even when there are not too many people seated the service can be slow. 

TIP: If you come on your lunch break at work, make sure you know what you want - order right away and ask for your check as soon as your meal comes. That is one of the only ways I have learned to assure that I make it back to work on time."}
{"text":"Thought it was a fun place at first until I got horrible food poisoning!! I don't recommend eating there!!! 
(Was there on 4/5/14 around 6:00pm - right before the Wisconsin/Kentucky NCAA game - ordered the Steakhouse Truffle Burger with tater tots)"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I literally crave their cheeseburgers all the time.  Staff is friendly and knowledgable on their many selections of beers. Lots of TV's all over with a giant patio that I havent yet had the pleasure to sit on because it is too hot.  Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for burgers before ball game. Food has good flavor meat was thick and juicy. Prices are on the higher end but would go there again when back in town."}
{"text":"The service wasn't great, I had to wait a long time to get a drink. The food is pretty basic bar food, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Came here after we hiked Camelback and it's great that it has several flat screen tv's for football, but the patio is dog friendly! Our server Gianna was amazing and recommended some awesome burgers and mac & cheese options. She also gave our pup some water which was really sweet. 

I ended up with the B.Y.O.M.C. (Build your own mac & cheese) and it was seriously so delicious. I will book a flight to PHX from LA just to order this again. My husband ended up getting the Steakhouse Truffle Burger which he says was excellent. It had a lot going on but in the best way. We both ate ALL of our entrees and I don't even regret this food baby I'll have for the next few hours...or days."}
{"text":"Beware the burgers are huge - and delicious.  Good wings although there are no flats (my favorite).  Have also had the cobb salad which was split between 2 of us.  Will definately be back.  My only downfall was the parking for a tall truck..."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger joint - highly recommend. Was visiting from out of town & had an overall great experience. Our server was in training & had someone shadowing her - they both killed it. 

Waters filled at all times. Consistently checked in on. Affordable & delicious. Great atmosphere - will be returning next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We had a great time going here with friends to watch some games.   I had the cheeseburger and it was excellent - one of the best I have had in a long time.  We also had the  fries which were fresh cut and really enjoyable.  Overall, this is a fun place to hang out, drink beer and eat a burger."}
{"text":"Finally tried some food here. We've only casually cruised by until this last weekend. We stayed to watch a Bears game which they had on because um hel-lo they have the Sunday ticket. YAY us! Tried the prime rib sliders & they were really good. Just the right size for sharing & the bartenders are quick. A bit too much in a hurry for chat or questions but they serve beer & so you order beer. It's all good! Gonna have to go back next weekend for more football & hopefully a famous cheeseburger. Mmmm"}
{"text":"Perfect place to eat good food and watch all sporting events-- if you're 21 or older and you have a vertical ID (in state or out of state) they won't serve you alcohol."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game but the food leaves a lot to be desired. Service great, lots of TVs, and good drink selection. However all the food we ordered tastes like it had just taken a salt bath. If we go back, it will be after we've had dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Our server Gina (I believe that was it) was awesome! Great service, cheerful, and very attentive. We had the hell fire chips to start that are always good. I had the steakhouse truffle burger with sweet potato tots and my brother had the juicy Lucy with fries. Yum!"}
{"text":"We just had a beer and a drink. Myself, inlaws, wife and 13y/o. Can't comment on food but to say a very limited menu. I guess the name says it all. Very loud."}
{"text":"Best place to have a beer (it is cold).  Best place to have a burger.  That is not even my favorite.  The Mac & Cheese is Awesome!  Great staff and service.  I am always taken care there!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch football outdoors. Food looked great for bar food but didn't eat, just enjoy some pints during college football. Great atmosphere. Great service."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday and surprisingly it wasn't jammed packed like sardines at other restaurants. In no way did this reflect the caliber of the food though. Cheese burger was thick while the veggies had a nice refreshing crunch. In house made chips washed down with a cold one is sure to make your stomach happy."}
{"text":"The best sweet potato tots of my life. Dip them in the honey mustard dressing equals amazing! The servers are all pretty cute and easy going. Dig this place especially on football sundays."}
{"text":"A lunch for 4 took us almost 2 hours this past Friday. It's burgers and freakin fries for crying or loud!! Yesterday. My 3 co workers and I walked to Evan Stevens for lunch by it was pretty crowded and we didn't want to get our food and go back to the office. We decided to check out Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers. 

We got there at exactly 12:40. I ordered a pint of Octoberfest Sam Adams and a turkey burger with the house chips. One of us order chicken tenders and fries. Another person ordered a Chicago dog and house chips. Someone else ordered whatever burger features BBQ sauce and bacon. I can't remember the name. My beer and the waters came out immediately. Around 1:30 we said .... man, it's pretty crowded for a Friday afternoon, maybe that's what's taking so long. Around the same time someone (assuming a manager) said our food will be out shortly. I finished my beer, slowly around 2. Again, we got there at 12:40. When I finished my beer at 2, the server asked if I needed another and reassured us the food would be coming out shortly. 

About 10 mins or so later, our food arrived. My turkey burger looked and smelled AMAZING. The house chips were cooked in old grease and tasted a little stale. My co workers chicken tenders were extra crispy and dark, almost as if they were cooked previously and thrown back in the grease. My other co worker said her hotdog roll was also stale. What a bummy lunch. We didn't feel the need to complain about anything because when looking around we noticed that we only saw maybe 3 serves for the entire restaurant so clearly they weren't expecting such a lunch run we're assuming. 

We quickly ate our lunches and left because we were then late for a 2:00 meeting. We should have went waited at Evan's. However, I loved my turkey burger. It was so flavorful, the house chips not so much. I'd visit again if I'm in the area and have no time restraints."}
{"text":"I was home for thanksgiving all the way from Auburn, Alabama. We brought about 12 people to the bar to view the Auburn football game. When we checked with the manager at 10am (in person) he said \"yes we will have the Auburn game on 1 or 2 TV's\" when we arrived with our table around 1 pm the Auburn game was not on any TV. When we asked several employees (who did nothing) then finally the manager who then said \"sorry I can't do anything for you\" I was furious. We would have gone to a different place knowing the game wasn't going to be on. My table of 12 Auburn fans then pulled up the game on our cell phones and had to watch it this way. We would have left if we had not ordered food and drinks. Just rude and disrespectful by the manager! Don't make empty promises! Won't be back!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times, this is your standard burger and beer joint (mostly a bar surrounded by tables). 

Upon reading some other reviews, I really wanted to say something different than \"Standard Burger and Beer Joint\" but I cannot find the words...this is your standard burger and beer joint.

They have a wide selection of beers, with several craft/microbrews and a few of the hard to find selections.

The menu is pretty standard for a burger place (Burgers, fries, apps, etc).  The food is good, and there is always a crowd, especially if the game is on (then it can be standing room only).

The restaurant/bar can be loud most of the time.  The bar is usually packed as well.

If you are nearby and want a burger, this is an ok choice."}
{"text":"Great experience. The food is good. There is a limited menu but almost unlimited varieties of each item. I recommend the \"Build your own Mac and cheese\". Service was great and a good atmosphere. I will be back when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Classic bar, nice patio, good burgers, good Cobb salad, good service, nothing amazing, but solid everything."}
{"text":"Top 99.897% worst look I've ever had from a hostess in my entire life. I can't think of a better word other than the most SMUG look from a human being I've ever received. If I am honestly inconveniencing you that much just tell me and I'll happily remove myself from this establishment. I was made to feel as if I needed to apologize for something. 
However 
The restaurant looks awesome and can't wait to eat and the waitress is great!"}
{"text":"Attempted to dine here a few nights ago. Sat at the bar and was basically ignored for 1+ hours, was checked on once to order a drink. Service was terrible, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! We like to sit at the bar but there are no bad seats in the place. The food has always been very good, you have to try the deep south hot dog. Its my favorite =) They have a great drink menu (recommend the cherry squirt) and tons of beer on tap. Its a must for all Blackhawks games!"}
{"text":"After waiting 30 minutes for a table which was fine especially since it was game day. The hostess attempted to sit us at a table and found that a patron was sitting there, the woman explained that she did not want to sit at her given table and chose to move, therefore the hostess sat us at the patron's original table. After sitting at the table roughly two minutes another patron came to the table exclaiming that I had taken her table. I directed her to speak with the hostess with regards to where I had been placed. Immediately after the woman left, the patron from the original table where I was suppose to be placed confronted me asking if her and her friend who was now at the hostess stand could sit at the table. To avoid further confrontation I opted to change seats. 
  After sitting at the table where I would have been originally placed, the server came out with drinks for the other patrons clearly annoyed with us. Making the whole dinning experience uncomfortable. 
   I understand Sunday game day is a very busy day, however, it would have been appreciated if someone from the hostess stand came to apologize for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Service was pretty decent. Food was alright, way overpriced. However my huge problem is that I went to the bar because my drink tasted like watered down strawberry lemonade and asked for a little extra shot. The bartender rolled his eyes at me and gave me attitude like I was bothering him because I interrupted him from talking to the lonely girl at the bar. Anyway, he ended up putting a shot of well liquor in, fine, but then we found out they added that to our bill. A $7 shot of well liquor to spice up my watered down drink. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Loved it! Great vibe, food and Stouts!! Food was amazing and would recommend a table in the patio. You get to see the city and great weather"}
{"text":"I had the Steakhouse Truffle burger based on all the good reviews and it did not disappoint.  A little messy (everything fell out of it), but it was very good.  The truffle flavor was not at all overpowering and the bun was really good too.  Great beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Met some friends yesterday. Our server was excellent. She was attentive but a little cold (not very friendly). Food was good. Had the juicy Lucifer. Had some good heat. Surprised that there wasn't more cheeses stuffed in the burger. 4 of 5 got our food. We waited 10 minutes until our 5th told us not to wait. We were just finishing when we flagged down a management person asking for our missing food. We finished when they finally brought food but guess what...brought the wrong order. Another 15 minutes until his meal finally arrived. A manager asked if he could bring us some drinks which was nice but didn't comp the order that was an hour in the making. They missed an opportunity to make a bad situation better.
I will return to a location closer to my house"}
{"text":"2nd time around and not much better in service. Food was mediocre, service was not good at all. but the location is awesome. Beer selection was very nice. Too bad you can't mirror what you do have going for you into your wait staff. I really was hoping my last time here was a fluke, but it's a strike two!! There will be no opportunity for a strike three."}
{"text":"Went here for a work event for the first time and was pleasantly surprised the staff was great and the burger selection was great as well plenty of options to choose from and with the easy to order build your own burger made it so easy for everyone to get what they wanted"}
{"text":"Loved it! Great for kids and Adults! Watched World Cup on more than 22 TVs. Tons on different beers on tap. Brings sports bar to a new level!kids lived they could customize burgers. Waitress was super friendly!"}
{"text":"So first I wanted to say that if you check-in you get $5 off your bill, which is absolutely amazing! There are TV's throughout the whole place, so if you want to catch a football game, you will easily be able to no matter where you sit. 
Time to talk about the food. The food is a little pricey, burgers run from $9 to $18 and appetizers around $7-$9.  The burgers are very fresh and taste delicious. All burgers come with fries which are also very good. There is a very impressive  draft beer and bottle lost and prices are pretty good. The Mac and cheese deal on Mondays is pretty sweet and they have other really good specials throughout the week. 

Great spot to come hang out with friends after work or to watch a game and grab a beer. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because it just didn't blow me away and I'm picky when giving 5 stars. Overall very good bar and I had a fun experience there."}
{"text":"We had an amazing first time experience here the other day. Our highlights included:
-yummy tot- chos 
-extensive beer list that had an awesome grapefruit shandy
-great service (attentive/friendly/knowledgeable/helpful for first timers) by Amber
-deal on yelp for $5 off our bill
We enjoyed ourselves so much we purchased the six-pack for the back of the house staff. Btw kudos to the owners/management for a way for patrons to acknowledge the kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"So, I'm torn about this review. The food was pretty excellent, but my rating is due more to the service than anything else. We went last night for happy hour, and sat on the patio. Considering it was 100, it was pretty comfortable! The food was great, but the service was horrendous. We had some girl wearing a hippie-type headband halfway down her forehead, who apparently didn't think we were worthy of her attention. I got there and waited 10 minutes for her to take my drink order. It then took another 10 minutes for her to bring my drink. After that, we didn't see her for 30 minutes. We had no water and empty glasses. She kept looking over at us, but never once asked if we needed anything. We had previously told her that we wanted to order food but weren't ready. Finally we flag her down to order more drinks and food. The food is brought by someone else, and the drinks arrive 10 minutes after the food. She didn't check on us once while we were eating. We had to then again flag her down to get the check, which took 30 minutes. We had the cards ready, so at least that was quick, but she never refilled our water (we were outside!), and didn't come back or acknowledge our existence. This was such a disappointing experience, as I've been there multiple times before and have never had bad service."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend for some easy food and drinks.  Unfortunately won't be going here again. Our waitress forgot our orders, gave me the wrong drink, and then the drink was quite weak considering how expensive it was.  Additionally the food was only average.  Not an awful place but there are better places for your money."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of the sliders and chili tots. The service was fast and curious. Great location and with group seating."}
{"text":"They have a good beer selection and burgers and fries are awesome. will definitely go back. Service at the bar was good. Patio for when the weather cools down should be a nice draw."}
{"text":"Good service and good place to catch a game. The tot chos were decent but my burger was over cooked. Overall, mediocre experience and may not be returning."}
{"text":"Came in to try their food, was immediately sat in a moderately busy night. Appetizers were amazing we got the pretzel and buffalo dip. The service was excellent friendly and very helpful. Burgers are phenomenal and Mac n cheese was perfect. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice already and have had a great experience both times.

For National Cheeseburger Day they had 2-for-1 cheeseburgers!  Their burgers are very tasty.  They're a little on the pricey side (around $12 each), but very good.

They also have an amazing Mimosa deal on the weekends.  Buy 1 for $10, and every Mimosa after that is only $1 each.

This is a welcome addition to the Old Town Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Ok, this place has s'mores that you make at the table. I am not kidding. They actually bring you the ingredients & a little fire pot. It's amazing & wonderful. 

I'll give you that their name is a bit lame, but the service is good, & fast. I've only tried the tater tots & s'mores, because I'm a grownup, so I can't speak to the other food. I had a really refreshing cocktail with cucumber & mint, which was nice too. 

If you go for nothing else, go with friends for drinks & make s'mores with them. It's the best."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the atmosphere is great if you want to watch sports. Prices are reasonable (especially during happy hour). Although there's no surface parking lot, I've never had problems finding street parking."}
{"text":"Meh. The service is never good here, and I've been 3 times. It always seems like it's the server's first day on the job. Here's what I mean:

The last time, I went with my boyfriend and his out-of-town friend. We ordered a round of drinks on a Saturday afternoon. I asked our waitress for a vodka-soda. She replied with, \"you need to tell me what kind of vodka you want.\"

I responded with \"ok, do you have Tito's?\"

And her response: \"I have no idea.\"

So I said, well if you do I'll have that, if not I'll just take whatever you have.\"

That's only one example; trust me, there have been many. But the food is not very good either, which is really the downer. Their burgers are pretty good, which is good because it's their namesake. But everything else (namely their appetizers) is dry and gross.

I want to like this place because it's such a great location and AWESOME patio, but no."}
{"text":"The service here is usually so-so at best, but you don't come here for that- you come for the food. My favorite is the Buddha Mac and Cheese or the Juicy Lucy burger. 

However, we came on a Wednesday night and it was the worst it has ever been. We only saw our server 3 times- take our order, bring the food, and then the bill. We had to ask for our own drink refills from other servers because ours was no where to be seen. Our food took upwards of 50 mins to arrive, 50!! And it was not great to say the least. My beloved mac and cheese dish (which I specifically came here for) was not fresh. I could tell that it had been sitting under the heat lamp for way too long because it was dry and stuck together. My friend got the buffalo chicken totchos and ended up getting food poisoning later that night...! Bad chicken. Our server never apologized for the wait nor acknowledged anything about the lack luster service. 

I am very patient and understanding about how people/places get busy and behind but you at least need to be proactive about it and put your guests first. It would have gone a long way if she had something like \"Sorry it's been awhile guys, we're short staffed tonight and doing the best we can.\" 

It's just overall very disappointing because I did enjoy coming here for the unique menu options but last night were the final strikes."}
{"text":"The name draws me in, but the food makes me question my decision. The bun got destroyed in the process of being eaten, which is a major no-no. When the bun requires me to break out the knife and fork to eat a burger...you know where this goes.

Kudos for offering some local beers -- I just hope they drop the Bud Light, Coors Light, Corona Light, etc. and really commit to local and craft beers and spirits. 

I'd go back, but I'd really like to see CB&CB evolve and become something great. Paint the walls and add something behind the TVs, drop the crap beer and fix up the menu. You can do it - I believe in you, CB&CB."}
{"text":"Sunday early afternoon: 
Outside seating, plenty of TV's w/ football, place is packed! 
I had a CB & CB burger & my wife had a BLT; each came with chips.  We shared a tap beer. 
Eats were tasty: her BLT \"was loaded/ bacon\"...she enjoyed it. My burger w/ gruyere cheese, fried onions, & garlic aioli was juicy & flavorful. 
All this was $30 w/ a 10% Yelp discount!  We were pleased!"}
{"text":"So the family was hangry after a long hike went to this place great location and atmosphere but horrible service overall mostly because the kitchen took more than an hour to send out our food we will never go here again"}
{"text":"Went there for a second time 7/7/2013 Food was great, had the Turkey Burger with the home made chips really great flavor, really liked the bun the caramelized onions . Service was good, sat at the bar so I could watch tv. We can't wait for football season. So many TV's with different programs on many of them. The bar was super clean and a large open concept. Lots of bar seating and a huge patio right in the heart of old town Scottsdale. Place was super clean and that's very important to me. 
Ill be back, Place has a huge beer selection, and large draft mugs. Its tough to pick only one. (so I had 2) 
If you like booths there were lots of those too."}
{"text":"Extensive beer list, awesome patio area, tons of tv's and really great food! What else can you ask for? Service was very good.  Talked to the manager about hosting a private event there even.

I've been to the one in Grayhawk but very glad they opened this one closer to me in Old Town.  Happy hour specials Bud Lt draft and I think Coors? $3, and specialty drafts $4 (I got the Nut Brown Ale, phenom) The Buffalo Chicken Dip is amazing as well, large portion, I had to get a to go box! 

There is a free parking garage right behind it for parking."}
{"text":"I like the food. If you want to eat and watch a game go to cold beer and cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick brunch before heading to Sky Harbor. Food tasted great (they have tater tots!!!) and the bloodies were delicious.  Service was quick and friendly.  Check it out if you're in the area..."}
{"text":"Outstanding burgers, sandwiches, drinks and appetizers.  The mmmmac and cheese offerings were amazing!  The only menu item I would change would be the chips.  They are served with almost everything, but are flat and unremarkable.  No one at our table ate them."}
{"text":"Great sports bar in old town. They put the volume on during the big games which is always a plus. Lots of TVs and a good draft selection. Come on Wednesdays for the build your own burger and check in on Yelp and it will cost you $5! Service can be a little slow when it gets packed but that can be expected at any place. Taryn was our server and she was great."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite game day spots! Great food, great beer selection, great crowd and you can see your game on where ever you sit. The only thing it is lacking is better (more positive & friendly) service."}
{"text":"Sat for 20 minutes with nobody acknowledging our presence. Not even a drink order. Tables around us which were seated after us were helped."}
{"text":"Came here because of the sign outside saying it was the place to party and we wanted Sunday drinks. Great deal on mimosas! Atmosphere is fun! Only thing that bothered me about this place was that I asked for the heat lamps on outside, she turned it on and a few minutes later they turned it off. It was so windy and the heat never reached us so I don't see anyone complaining about it so I'm not quite sure why they kept turning it off. Overall cool spot!"}
{"text":"The beer selection was nice, and the tvs were plentiful. It was a good place to watch a game. The food was a bit lacking in my opinion. I ordered a grilled cheese (which is pretty hard to do wrong) and the bread was barely toasted, and the cheese was a weird consistency. It seems like the best dishes here are tater tots and Mac and cheese, which is disappointing for a place with \"cheeseburger\" in the name. The menu is all pretty heavy, and I wouldn't suggest it to someone wanting a light, healthy meal."}
{"text":"1st time here. Had the bacon blue cheese burger. Ordered it medium and it came very pink inside, almost to the point of being raw. Other than that, it was good with a generous portion of French fries. 
Had the brownie sundae for dessert-outstanding. 
Service was attentive and friendly - no issues. 
Will eat here again."}
{"text":"I love this place! 

THE TOT-CHOS ARE TO DIE FOR!!!! Make sure you get the original kind not the chicken one. Way more bang for your buck if you get the original... I mean why would anyone give up the avocado?!??!  I literally only come here for the tot-chos when I'm feeling blue and need a pick me up.  Plus its a very effective sports bar, not one seat in the house can you not see a TV. 

This place is loud so don't bring children it would ruin the vibe."}
{"text":"I am a fan of how straightforward this restaurant is. It is like the movie 'Snakes on a Plane' you know exactly what you're getting. The burgers are in the $12-$18 range which is about normal for this area. There are some creative burgers on the menu, as well as your standard burgers. There are a bunch of televisions, so it is a good place to watch 'the big game'. The fries are really good, they stood out more to me than the burger. One of the people I was with loved the Mac and Cheese. Said it was the best in town."}
{"text":"I bet it's fun when you get the right stuff. Took an hour to get my order... Which ended up not being what I ordered at all. I ordered prime rib sliders. I got cheeseburger sliders with a side of au jus... Who honestly let that leave the kitchen? Also ordered a beer and got brought a second without asking and wash charged for it. Forget it, I won't waste my time here. The server was doing a great job being nice but there were a lot of mishaps that kept happening. The atmosphere is a mix of ages with loud music and crowds."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but not great either. Our first time having heard how good it is. For a place called cold beer and cheeseburgers I expect cold beer and delicious burgers. It didn't quite live up to the hype.

Service was ok. Beer, could be colder. Burgers were ok, I felt the meat was under seasoned. The bacon blue burger was a bit dry. My steakhouse truffle had more flavor, but the garlic breath after was pretty intense. We paid extra for fries and onion rings. Onion rings were tasty, fries were ok, cold have been cooked crispier or served fresher.

During specials or HH I'm sure it's a more reasonable value, but for full price I'd pass."}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome. We ate outside on the patio right on Scottsdale Road. We had a couple of beers which were all very good. Very large draft bottle and can selection. I had a burger the fire burger with jalape√±os and pepper jack cheese which was amazing.  My wife Have the prime dip with the horse radish which was amazingly au jus.  Great homemade sauces, great salad dressing, very good ambience. No question five stars."}
{"text":"If I could give a half a star I would. The service here is absolutely terrible to the point it's a joke. Do they even have servers working here???? This place could be great but it's not; flat our terrible, over priced, and just bad"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing!! It's open to be the outside, yet super cool when it's 104¬∞. Rachel Fink is one of the best servers any restaurant could have!!! I have in this business for 20 years. Managing and working in many restaurants. I would line to have her work for me!! We need more Rachel Finks in this business!! Definitely try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Really bad service. no longer offering brunch. not sure why i would ever come here again. really disappointed.you have been warned. They could have at least offered us a discount considering such a poor experience but not so much."}
{"text":"This place certainly lives up to it's name. The variety of beers is awesome and COLD. The burgers are BIG and savory and you can't go wrong with any of them! Friendly staff and great cocktails."}
{"text":"This burger place is packed on a Friday night, and the wait is worth it. Food is a little overpriced but it is one of the best burgers I've ever had, and portions fit what you pay for. The only complaint I have is that it was so loud from all the TV's being cranked on full volume, and the bar is so loud you had to yell whenever you tried talking to someone. Overall I would return to get another build your own burger!"}
{"text":"I am pregnant so I can't have under cooked meat. I ordered my burger with no pink. And it came out under cooked even though I told the server I can't have it that way. So they took it back to fix it and brought me back my burger now super cooked with the outside burned and no no fries. I had to wait to get those back. So I wouldn't recommend this place if you have to have your burger cooked through. You will end up eating a hockey puck."}
{"text":"They don't do brunch anymore unfortunately but the food was awesome! Service was amazing (our waitress was Alyssa)! I'll definitely keep going back!"}
{"text":"Woah!  Hold the salt shaker.  WAY TOO MUCH salt in the food - had a hamburger and onion rings.  I understand the theory of a beer place making things salty so that patrons will drink more, but holy cow.  That being said, the hamburger was cooked perfectly and the service was top-notch.  And yes, there was cold yummy beer.

This place is definitely the place to go for the 30 and under crowd.  It's really loud and there are plenty of sports on TV.  We wanted to try it since it's always crowded, but will chose a quieter place next time"}
{"text":"It was ok tonight!  Sandwich was decent, tater tots were really cold.  I did get a replacement but it was busy so it took awhile.  Average food tonight, waitress seemed to try.  Check in at the hostess was weird, kinda snotty to begin with.
I love the atmosphere here so that's why I come back."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection. Food...burgers were acceptable but tended to be a little pinker than our preferences, but the sides were always good. Scott the bartender was the only that we connected with and even though he couldn't remember our names, he did recognize us when we walked in. Pleanty of TVs to see almost any of the major games you'd be interested in. Bar was very spacious even when busy."}
{"text":"The beer was cold and I got the O-Lineman. The OL burger is a burger served between two grilled cheese sandwiches. If you are looking for something tasty with your cold brew of choice this is out of bounds.....in a good way!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since my husband had come for lunch one day and said it was good. 

Maybe they're great for lunch, but dinner on a Saturday night... I'll never come back. 

Maybe I'm just no fun, but the music was so loud that the three of us that went there last night had to scream across the table to each other. My throat is sore today as a result. I don't mind loud music, but when it's deafeningly loud and all you can do is sit and look at the people you came with... that's no fun. I recommend everyone in your group bring a phone so you can at least text each other. 

There were lots of choices for beer which was good, and the food I thought was good too. 

The service started out great. Our waitress was friendly, she brought 3 waters to us right away, and our beers came quickly after ordering. That's when the decent service stopped. We waited 30 minutes for our food to come out (and didn't see our waitress once during that time), and the table behind us, who had been seated after we ordered our food, got their food before we did. My friend asked for her burger to be medium well and it came out rare (my guess is that it was served in a hurry once someone realized our order hadn't made it out yet).We had to flag down our waitress to get silverware and napkins. Later we asked for a box and that took another 10 minutes. 

I might give them another chance, but only if it's for lunch and I have a lot of time to kill."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the  first time on the Fourth of July and I was so impressed! The food was perfect, but mostly the service was amazing. I have worked in customer service for a very long time and tend to be a customer service snob. The server was quick, I mean, really quick. And I was a full restaurant. The manager was out on the floor helping the servers and was making sure to chat and check in on guests. You don't see that very often anymore. I will absolutely come back and recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, and drinks! Love the atmosphere of this place and the burgers are awesome. The John Daly was an awesome drink along with the creamsicle frozen drink. Will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: prices up 50 cents on everything, including HH stuff It must have cost them more just to make new menus...so dumb. We are paying for their expansion. At least the new bartenders are still attractive.

Screw these money grubbing pigs. They are so greedy that they cancelled Happy Hour for all of Spring Training. They have like six restaurants now, but still trying to screw over the hard working people of Scottsdale. Respect the locals, know where you started and came from and stop your greedy BS. BOYCOTT."}
{"text":"Everything there is just amazing. The girls, the food and the service. I can't wait to go back!  New favorite place in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"A welcome surprise in Old Town for those that like beer and sports. Great beer selection for those that know what they want. I wouldn't count on the staff to be very helpful with the craft selections. Lots of TV's...not a bad seat in the house. They could lose the announcer/DJ...he sounds cheesy. Kind of like a strip club or so I've been told. ;)"}
{"text":"Great selection of Beer. Food is always solid and there are TV's for everyone to see your game. Today Caylee served us and she was wonderful.
We will be back again 4sure!"}
{"text":"I have been going here and the burgers are excellent and the beer is cold.  I decided to give the Beef Philly Steak a try.  NOT GOOD, it has potential. The meat was cut VERY thick.  I asked for extra onions and peppers.  The meat on the sandwich was very touch because of the thickness and not very much meat at all.  #2 NO onions or peppers at all.  Now at $15.00 thats a rough price for such a bad sandwich.  If they start making it like a traditional Philly , thin and lots of veges on it $15 is ok.  There are better Philly's for $9-10.  Comon you can do better"}
{"text":"This place is great! Been here 2x only; sat outside once and inside the other day. Service was very friendly and the food is AMAZING!!!! I had burgers both time and they cooked the meat spot on. I hate when you tell a restaurant \"medium rare\" and they serve \"medium\"! NOT HERE! If you ask for one thing u get exactly that perfect temperature.  My husband had the mac & cheese he build from the u ingredients option and was very very tasty.  Also, their sweet potato tots are yummy but sucks to pay the $2.00 fee instead of getting reg fries. I think $2.00 is a bit much. 

Besides that, beer selection is great and atmosphere is chilled. Very clean place, nice big screen tvs inside and will definately come back:)"}
{"text":"Really like this place, and plan on returning tonight to try the Mac & Cheese.  

I had great service from Jacklyn (sp?) at the bar.  Very good selection of draught beer, with what seemed to be an emphasis on IPAs.  I really wish they had some Belgians other than the InBev Leffe.  

Order the grilled wing drummies, and they were excellent.  Nice bite to the sauce and they were NOT fried!  

The guy next to me was having a burger, and he raved about it.  I wish they had a sampler so I could try the mac and cheese and the burger.  Guess I need to find a buddy to go with and split it!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Visiting in town:

Location: great spot near all the nightlife but not in the nightlife.  

Setup: Nice outdoor and indoor seating, big tvs everywhere and very tex mex style 

Food: simple menu, appetizer buffalo dip was all we had.   Horrible.....just shredded chicken and hot sauce. ..Nope

Staff:   it was late but I'll say this, no customer likes to be ignored.  Bartender spent most of her time talking to her boyfriend at the bar and cleaning the bar.   Actually asked us if we were done with our food while we had the food in our hands.....nope.

Overall:  good in theory but bad execution."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place in the world. This is another hip Scottsdale place I don't understand the hype behind. We used to get food here for work. The Tot-Chos are perfectly salty and delicious and filling. Everything except the sliders just seems like too much food to me. It's not like something you can ever reheat. Honestly, the beef burgers weren't anything special to me. Turkey burgers are the only things that really sound appetizing to me, thinking back on all my meals here, but, again, think BIG. Just thinking about it makes me full. 
I'd prefer quality over quantity, myself, so I don't see myself going here again."}
{"text":"The burgers are good the beer is always ice cold and they have a good selection to choose from. The place gets busy and a little loud so it is more of a bar type place to eat than a restaurant which is great. The staff was friendly and the service was quick. Can't go wrong to give it a try if your in the area."}
{"text":"As a sports bar, it's a good atmosphere with a lot of big TVs. Nice patio seating. However the burgers are not great. The patty was rather dry, even when cooked rare/medium rare. I had the steakhouse truffle burger, which has an impressive selection of toppings, but they could not save the dry beef patty. Onion rings side were pretty good, but a place with \"cheeseburgers\" in its name needs better beef, especially at $15 for a burger."}
{"text":"My family was looking for a quick bite to eat, and someone mentioned burgers. A short wait later and I was staring down a thick hamburger topped with an egg (a favorite of mine). It was exactly how I asked for it, and tasted great. 
   My wife wasn't super hungry, so she ordered a salad and also had no complaints. My son enjoyed a cheeseburger slider. 
   The real WOW factor came when my son ordered the tabletop s'mores. It came out with a small fire in a ceramic mug, a few more than a half dozen marshmallows, a bar of chocolate, and a bunch of graham crackers. Everything about it brought back a rush of camping memories and it was a *sweet* experience. 
   If I ever find myself in the area again, I won't hesitate to stop by."}
{"text":"Yelp Review
Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers
Old Town Scottsdale
4222 N Scottsdale Rd, Scottsdale, AZ 85251

Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers was definitely a suitable restaurant for a Tuesday night. They have a special menu from which you can build your own burger, exactly the way you want it, which I thought was pretty neat. I didn't actually build my own burger though, because their list of burgers on the menu was huge, and each description I read just made me salivate. I choose the 'Open Pit' burger, and was extremely pleased when the food was served. The burger was so big I had to rotate it a few times to decide how to take the first bite. It was topped with onion rings, bacon, and BBQ sauce, just the way I like it. Everything was cooked just right. Although, I would have appreciated a few more onion rings in the burger, the few I received were fairly small. After the main course, my brother ordered the S'mores dessert, which was pretty neat how they served us a small pot with flaming coals inside so we could each roast our own marshmallows. Along with the meal, I ordered a couple cold beers from their domestic menu and it was served in a fat glass mug. The mugs were pretty unique, almost like a huge coffee mug made out of glass.

Unfortunately, when you dine in Old Town Scottsdale right along Scottsdale Road, you are going to pay for it. The burger plates were fairly pricey, and our tab came to around $100 (that's with only 2 beers) for 5 people. Of course, we did order an appetizer and dessert, but a $13 burger is not something I am willing to pay for very often. However, you have to understand, you are paying for the ambience and atmosphere. You're right along Scottsdale Road, in a great location, and the bar had a pretty cool layout, as one side was inside the restaurant, and the other side was on the patio. On the other hand, I was not too fond of the bathroom layout. The bathroom was extremely tight, and I almost had no shoulder room between myself and the guy standing next to me. But ultimately, the restaurant was nice, the booths were spacious and gave my family of 5 plenty of room to get comfortable around the table.

The service at the restaurant was overall pretty good. The waitresses were all extremely attractive (as one would expect at an establishment like this), and our server was very nice and prompt, I think her name was Kylie, or something similar. We did not have to wait to be seated (we beat the night crowd) and the food did not take very long to come out. Overall, I'll give the place 4 stars. Food was great, service was good, and servers were great to look at. If you don't mind paying for a $13 burger, this is definitely one place to check out. [501 words]"}
{"text":"It was OK.  Service was slow, the burger was good but not outstanding, lots of TV's to watch sports.  With so many options in the area, I'm not sure I'll be back to this place"}
{"text":"An absolutely fantastic place if you like burgers and beer. My girlfriend is vegetarian and they substitute a veggie patty on any of their burgers for her and we have never had a bad experience. The servers are always very knowledgable on the beer selection and pairings...and what a beer selection it is! 

I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Have an hour for lunch? Don't stop here. 30 minutes before we saw a waitress, even after questioning the hostess at 20 minutes. Another 5 minutes for water and a waitress asking for our drink order. 15 more minutes to receive our drinks. Now we wait 10 more minutes to be asked if we are ready to order. 15 more minutes for the first 3 of 4 sandwiches to come out and another 5 minutes for the 4th one. So 1 hour and 20 minutes to receive drinks and food at lunchtime. Food was good but not to draw me back with the service being what it was.  Just as disturbing, we talked to a manager 1/2 hour in and nothing really improved. Management did cover our first round of drinks. 3 stars are for food alone, otherwise there would be none."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon during the college football games.  Place was very crowded which is a good thing.  I ordered a Camelback IPA, a local IPA recommended by the bartender.  I use the term bartender loosely, all the beautiful young girls in barely nothing T-shirts remind me of Hooters.  The beer was barely drinkable.  I tried the Arizona burger.  If I weren't starving I would not have been able to eat it.  If you're looking for a good burger and a beer as this place's name suggest, I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here but I would never come out of my way to eat here. It's walking distance away from my work place but unfortunately every time I have come here it's taken my entire hour long lunch break order and receive my food. On my most recent visit this afternoon, the server came by to greet us pretty quickly but it took roughly 15 minutes for her to come back and take our orders. After our orders were taken, we waited for what seemed like 30 minutes for our food to arrive- for two people. In that time frame, another table of four people was served and given their food. With about 10 minutes left until I had to be back at work, I asked the server to make our food to go because we didn't have enough time to eat. She came back with our food bagged up and was nice enough to foot the bill. Just hope their attention to customers gets better- especially considering their afternoons are usually not that busy the days I have gone."}
{"text":"Great burgers and beer selection! No surprise. I ordered the Jucy Lucy burger and it did not disappoint. The Sweet Potato tots are the best I've ever had! They also have a good selection of local beers! If you can, try to sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby. They have a good beer selection, and their burgers are pretty good (not out of this world, but still good). They have about a million TVs, but the few times I've been they are all playing the same game (maybe mix it up a little? There were certainly other games going on on the days we went). They were accommodating when we requested a particular game, but they stuck us at a table directly in front of the TV they used so we were going a little cross-eyed watching it. Parking can be tough because it's Old Town, but there's a garage not too far away. It gets busy during sports season, so be ready to wait for a table if a big game is on. We'll definitely be back, but it's not always my first choice."}
{"text":"Descent place for sports bar but first bartender took care of us 2nd bartender gave us very weak drinks and would not rectify.  Bill very expensive. ....."}
{"text":"Some old friends from the East coast were visiting AZ and decided that we should meet here. It turned out to be a good choice. It's right in the center of Old Town Scottsdale, and though it was happy hour, I easily found parking along the touristy stretch of nearby 5th Av. My friends are big ice hockey fans and enjoyed the game on the big screens. The appetizers, beers, and mixed drinks we had were excellent. It was very crowded and quite noisy, but then that is to be expected of any popular sports bar."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed of this place!. We visited this bar last night because we wanted to see the UFC pay per view fight. We sat by the bar and we received a good service from the bartenders but OMG the food!, My boyfriend order a cheeseburger and it was OK (not the price though) but my Hot dog (Tijuana Torpedo) right, was Horrible! Cold bread, bacon was overcooked and cold, not enough onions I just didn't like it at all! Do not order this!..I may comeback only for drinks but the food in my opinion it was overpriced and bad. The patio is nice."}
{"text":"Great place for Football and meeting up with friends. Food is fast and typical bar food. As the name reads that is what they serve. Plenty of people watching on any given Sunday."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  I appreciate the fact that a bus boy accidentally took my almost finished drink and the manager saw it gave a new one.  Good people and the fact the stay on top of things is rare for old town.   Always a good time here."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game! We came when it was super busy but the service was still great. Awesome food and the menu had a lot of option. So many great vibes here!"}
{"text":"From the outside this place is welcoming-great place to grab a beer and watch a game. Waitress was cute but Service and food was horrible.  Burgers over cooked, fries and tots way too salty.  
Definitely not family friendly with wait staff wearing shirts that say show me your tips."}
{"text":"If you're looking to watch sports, indulge in greasy (but delicious) bar food and sip on some ice-cold beers, this is your place! It is perfectly located in Old Town Scottsdale and on weekends, it is always packed with rowdy sports fans which makes the experience way more fun! They have a huge wrap around bar and a ton of seating both inside and on their patio. Their burgers are MASSIVE and I love that they give you the option of a pretzel bun! I ordered the Steakhouse Truffle burger to split with my fiance and holy goodness, it was delicious! I am SO happy that we split because it was 1/2lb!! It is also worth noting that their ranch dressing is phenomenal! I know that we'll be back soon with friends to watch sports and unwind!"}
{"text":"Great food for the whole family - kids 10 & 12. Went on Tuesday so had the $3 can special of passion fruit cider. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Good place to watch a game. They have good menu options. They have lots of local craft brews on tap. Try the Cobb salad it is delicious and packed full of good stuff. Good place for happy hour specials. I like the large outdoor patio. Come eat here."}
{"text":"Best Burger in old town in my book! If your craving a burger, and you have been here before, this is sure to be the first place you think of.  If haven't been here yet, this is a must try.  Prices on everything are very well priced from the cold beers to the cheeseburgers! Haha  

I always have great service here and have never been disappointed.  Prices are awesome too especially if you use yelp!  Hint.  

If I was to say anything against this place it would be for the wait to get in sometimes.  This is a sports restaurant/burger place with tv's throughout showing sports 24/7 so this may not make for a good date place.  If your girl likes rabbit food and you get distracted by sports go elsewhere.  Also, if your a snowbird, with a big group, plan on waiting a bit for a table.  The burgers and atmosphere are worth it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Some seriously yummy bar food. I'm vegetarian & they have great options for vegetarians. I usually order it for take out when I'm at work & it's always ready quickly & is still fresh. Great bar to stop by & relax with good food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Top notch burgers, amazing Mac n Cheese, a whole slew of great beers, and a ton of big screen TVs! On top of that, service is EXCELLENT, as is the management! Servers are free to wear whatever sports team's apparel they choose, adding to the melting pot experience that is Old Scottsdale. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a good solid burger or sandwich, a good beer, and a great place to unwind on the patio under the cooling misters. Prices aren't bad either, especially for the experience. I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"If you wanna get robbed and sick.. come here for happy hour. We went with several friends... we all left with sore throats (most likely from them not washing their glassware in the proper required solutions), then our bill came... it's clear they hope patrons don't check their bills in a large group, just pay it.... there were several items we had to tell the waitress to adjust because she charged us full price!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, great service!
I had occasion to visit twice in one week - and both times were fantastic.

I know the manager, Tracy, from the last restaurant he was at - he took great care of me there, and if it's possible, even better care of me here! Wow - I feel like a rockstar in this place! I was sharing with my lunch group Saturday - I really tend to avoid Old Town - but based on how both groups I was with last week were treated, it will be impossible for me not to frequent the place.

The servers are on the ball and don't seem to lose patience - even with large groups splitting the check multiple ways.

All food was delivered as ordered, the quality and flavor are solid and the portions generous. I am not going to make suggestions - I don't think you can go wrong anywhere on the menu. 

Oh, wait. One suggestion. The Hellfire Chips  on the appetizer menu. House made chips, buffalo sauce, blue cheese. So good! Its a really large serving - so either split it as a group, or plan on that being the majority of your meal. But WOW - so simple, but delish!

Thank you, CB&CB - and thank you, Tracy - for making sure we all (in both groups) had a great experience and look forward to coming back!)"}
{"text":"The homemade chips covered in buffalo sauce and blue cheese are amazing.  Great beer selection, tons of tvs and great service, no complaints here!!"}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour yesterday (7.26.13) and was definitely a great experience. I tried the Puerto Penasco Burger and had half fries/tots. 

I made a great choice. They also have great asparagus and tomato sides as well as the buffalo sliders which are good as well. 

Charlotte (the assistant GM) was a great host and made the experience fun and enjoyable and wanting me to come back there and try their \"Build your Own Burger\" on Wednesdays for $10.00 which is amazing. 

I would definitely recommend it again. 

FYI - They have over 100 different beers available as well ;)"}
{"text":"Food and service were great. However, when 2 of us asked to sit on the patio, which was only 25% full, we were told they have to save the tables for larger parties. When we left an hour later, there were still open tables on the patio and now there were parties of 2 at the larger tables. No explanation from the 4 hostesses. We're local and bring business to Scottsdale, but probably not here."}
{"text":"Great open concept restaurant with tasty comfort food. 

They have a nice selection of beer on tap, and a variety of food options for everyone including vegetarians (yay!).  We've been here a few times and every time it's crazy busy, so plan on waiting for a table especially during peak season. If you're going for happy hour I would suggest you call ahead and make sure they are still offering specials. For example, when we went during spring training they were not honoring happy hour specials. :( 

I was back-and-forth on giving this place a 3 or 4 rating, but unfortunately the service is never been spectacular so that coupled with the happy hour situation ... dropped it down to a three."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday, such a perfect burger day. $11 build a burger and you don't have to hold back.  Finger licking good food. 

Sat at the bar and met the bartender, Erin. She knew her beer knowledge and was very helpful, knowledgeable in beer and great company!

5 stars because I was overall impressed with all there services they provided"}
{"text":"I never would have imagined in 2017 a waitress would ask me to pay for food before it ever came. A fucking disgrace, if you are black or havr blacks in your party this location is not for you. This location sucks"}
{"text":"This is one of my burger fix spots at lunch. Just walk over from the office.  I ordered the o linemen once. What was I thinking? Is this lunch for two!?!"}
{"text":"Holy moly the Juicy Lucy is the way to go! Talk about the juiciest, most tasty, well-seasoned, steaming hot burger straight off the grill -- with bubbling hot melty ooey-gooey cheese sandwiched between two scrumptious meat patties. Wow, just wow! Phenomenal! But this was my main course... I was so excited I skipped ahead... But let's start at the beginning. 

Walked in, and got seated in Haley's section (sorry if I'm spelling your name wrong). She got our drink orders quickly and before we knew it, our drinks were on our table! (She was AWESOME!!! Give her a raise.) Then we placed an order for some golden chicken wings, and they were absolutely finger-lickin' good! Just as good as other places, just not as crispy and greasy/oily as they're baked not deep-fried. Score!!! 

Then the burger arrived... and it was game over! Food coma! Deliciousness wrapped in ooey-gooey-fattening-savory-juicy-scrumptious burger. That's all I have to say... Just order it, you'll see what I'm talking about. Total yum! 

The other burgers I recommend are the PB & J Burger, the Classic, Rocky Point Burger, and of course the Juicy Lucy. Oh -- and get the sweet potato tots (with a side of ranch.)"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. 
Came here on St. Patty's Day and of course, it was packed. But the bartenders were hustling and doing what they could to make sure everyone was taken care of and happy. Ordered food at the bar and I got a simple burger. Absolutely delicious! Ordering medium rare can be tough at some places, because some places don't know how long to cook it for, but the burger was delicious and juicy in the perfect way. Alison was fantastic as our bartender and took care of us :)"}
{"text":"Great place for fast friendly service!  The grilled asparagus and hummus appetizer is great along with the rest of the happy hour offerings!  Bartenders provide fun conversation.  As a single girl traveling alone for work, it's a fun place to go!"}
{"text":"Excited to see more locations popping up in the Valley. Fun place to watch a game or grab a burger in Old Town. Only downside is this place gets pretty crowded. Fun day of the week based specials--my fav being 'Mac Daddy' Monday: build your own mac and cheese with UNLIMITED toppings for $11. This is delicious but rich--you may want to bring a plus one to balance things out and split a burger with. Impressively long beer list (if you're into that kind of thing) and wine list isn't shabby either considering this is a sports bar."}
{"text":"After previously writing a review about an incident that occurred while I was dining at this restaurant, the owner contacted me to ask me about my experience. I'm extremely appreciative that she reached out to me and apologized for what happened even though it was out of her control. Although I was unhappy with my service when I visited this restaurant, the owner showed a lot of care in trying to make things right and I didn't want my appreciation for that to go unnoticed."}
{"text":"Second visit and had the CB&CB burger medium rare.  Excellent char and perfectly cooked but I found the bun a little too much and ate the second half without. Fries were nothing spectacular in terms of uniqueness but somehow addicting, didn't leave a single one on the plate."}
{"text":"First time at Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers.  I Arrived at 11:30 on a Thursday and it was half full. I was seated right away, given a greet and a menu. My server was pushing the cold beer but I was working, so had to pass. 

I ordered the Hot and Smokey Mac N Cheese plus an iced tea for $15.92. It arrived in about 10 mins.

The flavors were okay, with gooey, melted American, Cheddar and gruyere. It also had bacon, peas and a crunchy bread crumb topping. The bread was toasted a bit too much, so some of it burned, which made it bitter. 

Overall I received good service, with attention from my server and the manager. 

Lots of televisions around (sports on all channels), so there was plenty to see. Due to its location, there was good people watching too. 

I don't think Mac N Cheese plus an iced tea is a $15 lunch, so I'll try a burger next time."}
{"text":"a large group of us went for a birthday dinner on a Friday night .... you would think between the number of people (12) and the time of day/week (Friday at 6 pm), the service would be horrible or food lousy or SOMETHING but that wasn't the case at all!! The service was great and the food was amazing .... I had the cheeseburger sliders and tastes of the chili tots.  So good!! Plus, their happy hour specials are really great too! I highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"We returned the next night and enjoyed a few Happy Hour apps and a $12 Build Your Own Burger with unlimited toppings. The portion on the Hell Fire Chips is way too huge!! Really they need to serve about 1/2 to 2/3 of the amount and take a buck or $1.50 off the price. There's no way two people could eat that - or maybe offer two sizes - one size for two and one for a group of 4 or more. They were spicy and delicious with ranch dressing to cool them down.

The grilled asparagus were great - not overcooked at all with a nice charred flavor from the grill. The grilled tomatoes served with them were a nice touch.

We ordered a burger with a wheat bun (a tad dry :-( unfortunately), Swiss, bacon, jalapenos, red onions and mushrooms and the upcharge for onion rings (very good). It was delicious despite the slightly dry bun.

Original review:

For Chicago fans this place is great because they have WGN and we were able to see the Cubs game.

Many beers are $3 a can. They let us sit at the bar for 90 minutes and only had three beers total.

People around us looked pleased with their food. 

We will be back for the next Cubs game!"}
{"text":"We just stopped in to have a beer and then had two.  There is a large selections of beers including various local beers. If you are thirsty go here to have a beer."}
{"text":"Loved this joint. Simply put, great burgers, and huge beer list. i was thoroughly impressed with their massive beer selection and they have great weekday specials. Happy our 3-6pm. They also have burgers of the week specials where you get a burger and chips for $10. Most burgers cost $12-15 dollars and you can get it bunless, or gluten free bun if you would like. They do charge $4 to split a plate, or extra if you prefer to have a salad, tater tots or fries with your burger instead ( $2)
Place was packed during the GSW basketball games so food took a bit longer than expected but overall service was good. Definitely THE spot for a delicious 1/2 lb burger!"}
{"text":"We were in on a slow Tuesday and bellied up to the bar for a late lunch.Big space lots of T.V.s. Decent beer selection including west coast breweries and local...which I appreciate. Our server was prompt and attentive
To break it down we ordered:
Buffalo chicken dip(it was meh probably wouldn't order again)--$9
Truffle Burger(deliciouso!!!) $13
Prime dip(another winner) $14
We did have an unintentional discrepency on our bill which we were overcharged. After speaking with one of the managers Charlotte she quickly handled the issue.
All in all nothing beats a cold beer and burger. I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Good beer selection but a sad excuse for truffle burger an truffle fries. All of us thought the rest of the burgers were pretty sub par at best."}
{"text":"Cold Beer and Cheese Burgers gave changed their menu. Now you get chips with a sandwich instead of fries or tots. The chips appear to be home made. You'd think they would be good. They are not. Lays chips from the grocery store are better. The quality of the food has gone down hill. Its bar food now. Such a shame. The Monterey chicken sandwich was ok. It did come with 1 small slice of avocado which didn't even cover 1/3 of the sandwich. It was $12 and you could add fries or tots for two dollars more. CBCB what are you thinking???"}
{"text":"First Chicago dog I found since I moved here! Ingredients are fresh, chips and fries are home made, service is great, nothing really bad to say about this place"}
{"text":"From the front door, to the table the service was top notch! Everyone was warm and welcoming!  The burgers here are superb and I highly recommend the steak butter topping to any burger you may order.. it's $2.00 but a tasty treat worth every penny!

You can make your own burgers with their simple ordering sheets.  One of my favorite features is the open design.  on a warm day you can sit there and feel a breeze blow by, or sit in the back in a booth. 

Tons of beer selections!

Cant wait to go back for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"So being a self proclaimed burger expert can't quite give this place a full five stars but don't get me wrong they make a damn good burger when they get it right! I think they have staff issues as it seems there are always new faces in there. That aside lets talk about these burgers! First off go on Wednesdays or you are missing out as you can build your own and pile on as much naughty crap as you want all for $10. This means you can build a burger with bacon, chili, fried egg, mac & cheese, and a bunch more to make well just about impossible to finish. Just remember folks burgers are super foods they cover all the major food groups all in one delicious package! A burger a day keeps the gym away!"}
{"text":"Good food, but not amazing. Everything tasted a little salty. Service was friendly. Typical sports bar atmosphere. Large portions. If you do a build your own burger they charge for each item (any sauce other than mayo or ketchup was $.50) including mustard which seems silly. If my husband would have built his own, it would've been at $14 burger. While good, it's not worth that much. If I was in the area I might go again, but probably would try other restaurants first."}
{"text":"I'd actually give 3.5 if that was an option.  The location is pretty awesome with plenty of parking in the garage out back and a few in the tiny lots surrounding the place.  They have a nice patio to look out onto Scottsdale Rd from.  

The beer selection is pretty amazing and it seems like they usually run a beer special.  The menu has a lot of items on it, not just burgers but we didn't really try anything else yet.  The burgers were solid with not too much grease, though it was close.  They were cooked to order which is good and came with home made chips that were pretty darn good.  

The dessert was confusing because they have a brownie sundae and a brownie shake; we ordered the sundae but it was pretty much a shake that hasn't been mixed?  I'm not sure why but the ice cream was kind of more shake-y than scoop-y like it was blended, and it all came in a sundae glass.  The brownie was cut into large bite-size squares which was a little too large to chew comfortably even without a bit of \"ice cream\" in the mix.  We eventually just got a to-go cup so we can pour it in and freeze it at home.  

Ultimately this is a solid food place that could be fun.  Don't expect any kind of value pricing though, everything is pretty much priced out to the max of what people would be willing to pay.  At least the food isn't terrible, which is often the case in Scottsdale along with prices as high!"}
{"text":"I have always been intrigued by this place since they chose such an unoriginal name, but always seem to have a crowd.  We decided to stop in for a quick dinner before running some errands at the mall.  The place was packed especially since it is during Spring Training, but we were lucky enough to find two seats at the bar.  The bartender was friendly and quickly took our order.  I enjoyed a cider on draft and a 1,000 Island burger with fries - pretty darn good!  Great place to watch sports, drink beer and enjoy a tasty burger!"}
{"text":"My first time to Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers. I enjoyed it overall. They have a great patio. It's a great place for watching a game.  I was there with some gals for Happy Hour and to watch the Cardinals baseball game.  I ordered a margarita. The server, Brittany, said they have a skinny margarita which was fine with me. She brought it to me and this margarita looked dark and brown not the typical yellow/lime and goldish color. I always drink margaritas, there was no chance this was a margarita.  It had no tequila in there, it tasted like there was whisky in it. All the other ladies at the table tasted it and thought the same thing, this was no margarita. I told the server about it, she said it was a pre-made mix.  That's fine with me if it's a pre-made skinny margarita mix, it just needs to have tequila in it.  She was apologetic, I told her it wasn't her fault and she didn't make it. Brittany took it off the bill and I got a glass of wine.  We ordered a cheeseburger off the HH menu and got The Staple Mac n Cheese, both were amazing.  I'm looking forward to going back for great food, amazing service and the fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"The burgers are incredible.  BUT... They're ALMOST worth listening to the 90's techno crap.  Key is ALMOST.  Wow, someone really has to let 'em in on the secret.  Seriously, to sit thru that music should really tell you how really great the burger is!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night & sat outside. The server was really sweet & attentive.  I got the mac & cheese as well as their grown up iced tea.  Both were really really good! Nice place to have a few drinks & some food! Lots of TV's with the games going which my husband loved."}
{"text":"Since Yelp requires users to provide reviews across the entire rating spectrum vs. just raving about and speaking positively about the 5 star places we all love, I am going to pick on Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers for my 1-2 star review.

Food and beverage rating: 4-5 stars
Service rating: 1-2 stars

I had a chipped edge on my cocktail glass and the server said \"Oh I am sorry, let me comp that drink for you\" and then charged me for it anyway. When I brought to her attention the apparent mistake, she got sassy and the manager was unprofessional and lame as well. Gave me some sob story about how comped drinks come out of their pockets, like it was my fault that there was a shard of glass in my mouth and drink.

Isolated incident and the rest of their service is top notch? Probably.

Thanks Yelp for asking me to rate a few people poorly in order to provide 5-star ratings to those who deserve it. ;)"}
{"text":"Our waitress was Allison and some other girl. I believe one of them was training. But it was difficult to depict who was training who as both girls were following each other around aimlessly. The girls proceeded to flirt with a table of 5 or 6 guys for a good 10 minutes, backs turned to us as our dirty plates sat in front of us. I ordered a Mac and cheese burger and had bacon added. The bacon was undercooked and there was very little Mac and cheese on the burger compared to the many previous times I have ordered this particular burger. Needless to say not only was I disappointed with the service I received but the meal as well. Next time I'll drive up the street to rehab burger therapy instead of wasting my time and money here."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon. Nice vibe. Has an industrial feel with high open ceilings. Wall is open to the outside patio. We ate on the patio and it was a fun setting. Beer flight was cold and tasty but we ordered light flight and the server told us that the bartender set up the local flight. We didn't want to be jerks and said that was fine, but she should have handled it with the bartender and brought us what we ordered. I had the BLT and could only eat half of it because it was so dry.  Also the sandwich was not balanced. One side was all bread and the other side had the lettuce and tomato. Oh well. Others had the chili Mac n cheese hot dog and the pancakes. We laughed that the syrup was in a sticky bottle right off the grocery store shelf. I would go again but would only have an appetizer and a beer. Definitely fun ambiance!"}
{"text":"Only giving 3 stars because this is a great place to watch any football game you want... and because there is a Bloody Mary bar! Other than that food is really basic bar food. Hard to complain when I got to watch my Hawks, while sitting in the sun, sippin on my self-made to perfection Bloody Mary! Lots of people gathering to watch and root for their team made it extra fun and interesting. I always prefer more hawks fans in the room, being from Seattle, but this worked too. If you're looking for your football game you better believe it'll be playing on at least one of their many screens!"}
{"text":"I loved the Hail Mary bloody Mary, it was very good. The chili mac, buffalo dip and Reuben burger were very good. The ring of fire burger was dry and bland."}
{"text":"My husband and I often come here to enjoy happy hour and maybe get something to eat. This is a great place to watch any game as TV's flank most of the restaurant. I often get the chicken sandwich without a bun and a salad. My husband enjoys the classic buffalo grilled drummettes  with ranch as the dipping sauce. We like to sit at the bar and we have always received excellent customer service. We will continue to visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Of you go here- get the buffalo chip appetizer! It was very good but spicy! The buffalo wings however left my son disappointed after the chips being so good. Burgers were very good. Try the PB&J one. My only complaint was how loud it was! Multiple TVs turned up, stimulation overload!"}
{"text":"I think  I really like this place. There beer selection is insane, prices are decent(cans of old style for $3), food prices are a tad high but not too bad , good selection on tap. atmosphere is excellent, service is excellent, food is very good. The kids menus items are a bit small so order off the adult menu for an older child, my boys had to order a second kids entree. Huge parking garage directly behind.
Five Stars."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer, decent appetizers, decent price, great service. I've only been here a few times, and every time I've gone I've only gotten a few beers and an appetizer. The trivia nights on Thursdays are fun. At 9PM they hand out score cards and the trivia questions are on the TV. A lot of people get into it and it lasts quite a while. The service is really great. There was only one incident last week when we were waiting way too long to get our check. I had to go to the hostess to ask for it because our server was MIA. No big deal though, every other time I've been there I haven't had any problems. Last time our server was Bippie... I have no idea if that was her real name, but either way she was awesome. We were there for about two hours and she always made sure we had something to drink. I definitely recommend checking this place out. Yes, as other reviewers have noted, it does get loud sometimes. On a busy night, it's better to be seated in the outside section if it's not too hot, as it is a little quieter than inside."}
{"text":"Horrible experience getting a table rsvp. We placed ourselves on the table list and as the game ended we never received a text that a table was available for us. We saw throughout the floor that tables were being taken up by other people not on the list. Seems like they accommodated other people. I checked twice and they stated were trying but other sneakers were seating themselves and the staff just said ok have a seat !!!! Horrible this needs to be addressed"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night around 5:30, patio seating. Awesome service and awesome burgers! Try the buffalo tots, for sure a great starter! Truffle burger was our choice and it was out of this world. Loved the vibe and energy of this CBC out of all the ones I've been too!"}
{"text":"The food was very heavy as what is to be expected by a beer and burger joint. The group we went with had multiple hot dogs and one burger. The chili sauce that was on the hot dog was not as close to a chili sauce as it should have been.  It needed added flavor however the fact that the hot dogs came grilled made all the difference in the world. The sweet potato tots had a little too much seasoning on them but were crispy. The service was great and did a good job making us feel welcome.  The burger had a massive bun that took away from the taste of the burger itself. Great TVs and great outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, everytime we dine in. Especially like the indoor/outdoor feel. The service is great. Yesterday it seemed a lot noisier than usual."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with a group of 10.  We were told that the wait would be 45 min to an hour, but it turned into an hour and a half.  We were watching the NCAA March Madness at a nearby bar, so it was OK.  Our waitress was super sweet, but the kitchen was slow in cooking our food.  Atmosphere was fun, but music way too loud.  I ordered the bleu cheese and bacon burger.  It was cooked as I asked.  All in all it was a good place to go after seeing the Giants play a spring training game."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time today and the burger was good but nothing out of the ordinary. Although, the beer selection is amazing. The only thing we had a problem with was the service. It took us about 10 minutes to get the bartender's attention to order food. She didn't ask how we wanted it cooked or what kind of bun we wanted (which apparently they have a selection). When we got our food we didn't get any silverware or napkins. I had to flag down the bar back and ask for a napkin and he came back with a few bar napkins, which aren't very useful when you have messy hands. We never got refills on our drinks and no one checked in on us. When we asked for the tab it took another 15 minutes to even run our card. I don't think we'll be eating here again but we will definitely be back for a beer."}
{"text":"Tons of beers on draft and tons of TVs is a really good start to an awesome place to watch football.  Im a little upset that I only found this place towards the end of the season.  Don't waste your time going anywhere else in old town unless you want some 21 year old barfing on your shoes or are really into listening to loud electro music while you watch football.   The bartenders and waitresses are friendly and actually appropriately staffed which is a big change of pace in old town.  Not a big red meat fan but the turkey burger is outstanding.  Most place's turkey burgers are the same lump of crap but I think they make them fresh here.  On a side note it does get very crowded here so you will have to stake out your spot early for a big game."}
{"text":"first time there was visiting the in laws the service and beer selection was awesome but the food sucked they burn't the burger to black not sure why the cook even served it that way the frys were cold and my wife's tots were cold.  we didn't get charged for the burger thank God very load place not sure whey the dance music came on in a sports bar at 8:30 but will most likely never return"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is pretty good.  It has the typical sports bar feel and lots of TVs. I haven't been here in summer, so I have always asked to be seated on the patio where you can see all the TVs if you're interested and still hear the person you're with if conversation is more what you're after.
The food was great! I am a sucker for a great burger and a great beer. Definitely one of my favorite burgers anywhere. The best selling point for me here is that that actually get it right on the cook! I cannot stand an over-cooked burger (read: well-done) and usually have a very hard time finding a place that can consistently get it right! I haven't been disappointed here yet whether I am in the mood for \"medium well\" to \"still mooing\" and anything in between. I would like to point out that the burgers are a bit pricier than your average bar burger.
I have had the french dip here as well, and it was better than any of my other recent experiences in other places. I was about to swear off ordering french dip, but I might be convinced to hold on a bit longer.
The beer list was great! Definitely something I think anyone can find something tasty on. I love being able to enjoy a tasty burger while enjoying a range of IPAs so I had a nice section of good beer to choose from.
However, here's my complaint... chilled glasses!
I realize that if you're just ordering a domestic lager from one of the Big Boys, then a chilled glass may be preferred. I mean, hey, those things haven't much flavor to begin with!
But, when you have quality beers on the list, please honor my request for a NON chilled glass! Also, when ordering bottles, I request a glass with my beer. I have had to Remind my waitress several times that I have been waiting on a glass, and please oh please can you find me one that isn't chilled. Nope, I usually hold the empty glass in my hands to warm it up before I pour my beer.
I love places that have a great beer selection for those of us who enjoy craft beer, but please know that there are appropriate ways to serve different things. It's not a deal breaker though, and I guess I can wait a few for things to warm up a bit before I start consuming.
All in all, I do like this place and will return whenever I'm in the area, but the waitstaff can definitely use a bit of improvement in terms of friendliness, helpfulness, attitude."}
{"text":"During the football season, you can find me at Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers most Saturdays... Why??? Because they're an Auburn bar. Am I an Auburn fan? Hell no. -BUT- it means that they are one of the few places in town that carries the SEC network, which means I can almost certainly watch my Tennessee Vols! (And drown my consequent sorrows in delicious craft beer..)

As for the actual restaurant...  I really enjoy CB&C Scottsdale for the casual, open-air ambiance and their great food. You've got to start out with the Tot-chos, which are going to be amazing. They're basically tater-tot nachos and they're twice as delicious as that idea sounds. (The half order is pretty big, but if you're going with a group of more than 4, get a full order!)

What's next? Well, you could honor the namesake and go with one of their classic burgers (which are fantastic!) or you could go out on a limb and build your own Mac N Cheese. (My preferred meal of choice!) You can add a huge array of veggies, meats and other toppings that make your mac out of this world! If you feel a little healthier, their hummus and veggie platter is great, and while I haven't tried them, their salads look pretty tasty.

So, check it out, splurge, and lessen your guilt with a stroll around Old Town afterwards. For the best ambiance, try to catch a game while you're there!"}
{"text":"Great cheeseburgers and beers!!  Give in to the BEER pressure. Great patio with misters, lots of tvs for your sports fan. Great burger. I got the one with sour cream guac and pico de gallo.. but the bun was a little soggy.. But the burger was too good.. Just took off the bun and cut it up. The guac was good too. A great place to hang out in the heart of Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Good menu with other goodies other than burgers. Nice beer selection including local brews. The staff their is not the greatest."}
{"text":"Good burgers, cool atmosphere. I sat at the bar, service was good and very helpful. Will go back."}
{"text":"After about 2 dozen visits I think it's about time for a review.

Why 4 stars and not 5?!?! Because it is not the best Hamburger in town!!!
Sure they are doing a lot of things right, probably everything right, but there is a lot of competition these days and a few blocks south and just to the east is a great place that is making The finest Hamburgers in the country. However that doesn't take away from all of the effort and expertise exuded at CBAC.

About those burgers I have tried a few and they are great, I really like to build my own so It's just so and that works out great for me. They make that nice and easy with the customer order forms for build your own burger and on the other side build your own mac and cheese. With the burgers comes great fries, or chips, and other options to upgrade your sides for a price. Meat and non meat options are also great for the burgers so choice and selection is awesome. My only \"beef\" with the burgers is with the cheese, it isn't melted to the patty, its always stuck to the top bun, always, so I imagine it's just how they do it, instead of a cooking problem.

The prices seem to be a little high, It's Scottsdale prices for sure, from $9.00 to $14.00 for burgers and mac and cheese option are about the same. Up grade your sides and have a few beers and per person check averages are a restaurateur's wet dream.

I like to sit at the bar where service has always been efficient if not great. The ladies behind the bar are attentive and are always ready to make that sale. Maybe I don't go enough or just because they are so busy, but nobody has ever remembered me and welcomed me back. That's a little surprising since I live in Old Town area and manage a club around the corner, and often have my pre-shift meal here. I am going to just chalk that up to the volume they are doing, this place is always busy.

Big TV's, visible management, attentive service, decent Happy hour, and a pretty good meal, in a great location works for me. Looking forward to seeing what's next from this team!"}
{"text":"Had some really great fried fair...I really cant eat like that everyweek but it was very good for a cheat meal!"}
{"text":"Came here a while back. Don't remember much from that experience. This one was memorable. Great onion rings. I would like to consider myself an onion ring afficianado. Great burgers. The one with thousand island is what we had. Flavorful meat. Good times!"}
{"text":"Good burgers and more. Kind of loud music, had to ask to turn down. Plenty of burgers to choose from making you come back. ToT Nachos are good & satisfy  your craving. Ring of Fire burger good if you like your burger w/ a kick of spice. Looks like they're planning to expand concept as this new location seems kinda corporate. lots of big screen TVs surrounding the place. Good for people watching."}
{"text":"Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers is always delicious the times I've been here. It can be really busy, especially when a game is on. They host watch parties for several different teams. I prefer a weekday night just to avoid the big crowd; however, Cb&C has a really fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Best hamburger I've EVER had!!!! My parents agreed. The place is incredibly loud, however. Like... You have to yell, essentially. Outdoor seating seemed nice but it was completely full. Lots of misters to keep it cool which is nice. Lastly, the coolest thing is that you can leave the premiss and remain on the waiting list. They text you when your table is ready. You can just text them if you're not coming. WARNING they say the wait is muchhh longer. They told us 20 minutes and it was only about 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Thurs night. A couple groups and about 25 tv's. The food service was quick and our burger and frys plate was big enough to feed both me and my husband; along with a couple of beers we were perfectly full. Nice patio as well to enjoy the AZ weather."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with some friends. This restaurant has a sports bar type feel to it. Plenty of TVs, so a great place to come watch a game.

The food was good. As the name suggests, burgers are their specialty. I did the build your own burger option. It tasted good, however, I do have a complaint here. I chose to add guacamole on my burger, which cost $2 extra. There was a very tiny smear of guacamole on my burger, definitely not $2 worth. 

Our server was friendly but they forgot to bring out the food for one of my friends. So we had to ask the server about it and then wait about another ten minutes for her food."}
{"text":"Ordered a veggie burger, to split, with a side salad.  Total came to $11 for the veggie burger $2 side salad #1 $2 for side salad #2 and $2 charge to split the meal!   Total was $17+ tax to split a freaking veggie burger with a salad!?!?

My wife ordered 3 vodka press' during the ballgame.  She switched flavors for something different and was not told about the price difference between the cherry vodka brand and grape vodka brand.  Not good service.

Unless we are asked to meet friends here for a happy hour drink or something...we won't be coming back.

Even for old town this place is overpriced for what your getting.

As to be expected in old town, the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Mac n cheese was super creamy and delish! Service was great too - Michelle I believe!"}
{"text":"Average food, meh attitude from the staff and LOUD! Patio is nice for people watching but the misters are insane and normally drench people."}
{"text":"Cute location! Was a bit crowded but I expected it! It's a great place to drink draft beers and watch games. We sat at the bar at watched the game. Great hospitality given by the bartenders. I saw some sliders I wanted to try so I def will be back to eat!"}
{"text":"My daughter (senior in college) was in town for the first weekend of the NCAA Basketball Tourney. We were looking for a place to watch the games for Thursday, the round of 64. We did a drive by and saw all the TV's figured we would give it a try. We got there a little after noon. They were busy, but we were seated immediately at a table were we could view 3 games at the same time. 

CB&CB has many beers on tap. I wish I could quote the number, but I don't remember. Our burgers were very good, fresh and done to order. We had Fries and tots as sides. We wife joined us after work and had a salad that she enjoyed. 

The staff was very friendly and attentive. When we finished eating we told the server that wanted to stay and watch a few games. We told here that we could move to the bar, but she said we could stay as long as we wanted. 

I would highly recommend CB&CB when you want to kick back with some friends for food and a drink and to watch sports on TV. We were there in the afternoon and it seemed very family friendly. I am not sure what it is like in the evening however."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a burger and beer.  Everytime we are in Scottsdale we make a stop in.  If you enjoy quality and a great atmosphere... This is the place.  The bartenders are top notch. Enjoy!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Their Pattie's are frozen pre-made rubbery burgers. For 16 dollars plus 2 extra for any side besides chips..you're paying almost 20 bucks for a burger you could eat at a dive bar for 7.50. Their ranch is also fake kraft ranch. Never again!"}
{"text":"Really cool place, great location & delicious cheeseburgers! I really enjoyed my Bacon Blue cheeseburger here. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of burgers, but they will make it for you without the bun and you can turn it into a healthy meal. Great place for watching games, lots of tvs!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere! We went here for lunch and sat on the patio. They even have ice chests in the table for the beer. I got the Oreo milkshake chicken fingers and fries. They had a lot of options. Great place to get together with friends to watch sports."}
{"text":"Not terrible food, but not great. Buffalo chicken  sandwich for over $12 and they give you about a teaspoon of blue cheese crumbles. Entire thing was pretty flavorless Food was only lukewarm when we received it. Waitress was very nice, but was yelling when she was talking, probably because of noise overall in the place. Will only come back if I have to. Very overpriced for the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is brilliant. The name itself takes away the pain of deciding what to order. We were seated at a comfortable booth with perfect view of the Diamondbacks game. The open pit burger was the best western burger I have had in Arizona. The Waitress was knowledgeable and friendly. We went on a busy Friday night and the atmosphere was fun. Everyone seemed to be having a good time."}
{"text":"Hashtag YUMMMM! 

My husband and I tried this place on a whim because he refused to eat at my favorite restaurant for the 5th time in 3 weeks (go figure). We were looking specifically for burgers and beer so the name definitely caught our eye. We came during march madness and the place was packed but had great energy! We sat at the bar and had a couple of beers in doors but near the open patio on a gorgeous day. They have an excellent beer selection! We also did the build your own burger and build your own macaroni and cheese!  Although after all of the additions to our meals it was pretty pricey it was totally worth the cost!

The burger we built was-
Angus beef
Pretzel bun
Bacon
Red onion 
Mayo
Golden mustard (which was kind of sweet)
Jalape√±os 

The macaroni we built was perfect! I definitely recommend this combination.
We added-
Gruyere 
Garlic
Red pepper 
Grilled chicken 

We used the 5$ off your tab yelp coupon which was around 10% of our bill after 4 beers, a burger w fries and macaroni. What an awesome deal! We drive all the way from chandler to try this place and will definitely make it back soon!"}
{"text":"I love this bar! Food is delicious & the wings here are without a doubt my favorite. The only downside is that you have to pay extra $2 to get fries or a different side instead of their \"chips\" which I dislike immensely. However, despite the prices, this place rocks!!! Tons of TV's to watch games on, huge menu to order from, great customer service, attentiveness and the location is prime for me (. This place is PACKED all the time, so make sure to get there early if you plan on going there during big games."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. No double or imperial IPA. Food looks average at best but was not worth the try. Move on way better choices in old town."}
{"text":"I'm in Scottsdale visiting from Pittsburgh and decided to try out this restaurant. The food was amazing and my server was the sweetest thing!! Her name was bailey and completely made my experience that much more nice. My server made the whole experience come together. I'll be visiting again!"}
{"text":"I have tried really hard to like this place!!! Location and the patio are fabulous but that's is as far as the fabulous goes. Have been here three times and every time it got consistently worse! First time it took 25 min and 3 servers to get a second glass of wine. Food was terrible and was sent back after looking at it! I ordered their fancy grilled cheese which came cold with half ingredients missing and looked like a 5 yearold made it! Second time we came the serve asked for drink order came back twenty min later we still didn't have drinks and came by asking if we were ready to order drinks to which we replied we already did at that point she realized that she forgot to put the order in.  We were understanding since it was first week of football and they were busy.third time must have been the worse. We ordered wings as an app and they actually would have tasted great if they were hot. They were barely warm and looked like they sat in the kitchen forgotten for awhile. We had to wait at least 25 min for drinks and that's even if the waitress asked if we needed more. Each time she would come around she would ask one person without looking around and asking the others if they needed anything. We finally ordered food and one of the items was completely wrong. The serve told the girl she will take off the bill then came back and said her manage didn't approve the comp and was just going to change the price to the item she got!!!! Are you serious??? At this point the whole table was so upset about the whole experience that we asked tho see the manager. He was very apologetic and comped the whole bill after making excuses about the whole situation. Shocking we still went back(due to some friends wanting to check the place out) and this is why this review is 2 stars and not 1. We got the same serve as last time which was awkward at first but she definitely redeemed her self and was on top of her game. The manager remembered us and got us a round of drinks and asked how everything was. I am hoping that they are on the right track and that the service continues getting better and hopefully the managers continue execute great customer service. I will continue editing this review to higher stars if they continue doing a great job."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in between 630p-645p on Wednesday, 12/23/15.  The place was not busy at all, maybe about 10 total tables sat with a few people at the bar. We were data immediately and received our menus and told a server would be right with us. We were sat at a table right next to the bar.  10 minutes later, no one had shown up yet to greet us or take our drink order. We flagged down one of the 2 girls running the host/hostess table at the entrance and let her know that our server had not been by yet. She apologized and said she would send someone over. We then watched another table get sat 2 tables away, have a server come to them first, take their drink order, receive their drinks and not once did anyone come by our table. 

We decided to get up and leave at this point. Best part is what happens next. As we begin to walk out, 2 guys who were cleaning the tables came to our table and cleaned up the menus and our build a burger orders that we have prepared within 30 seconds of us standing up and leaving the table. Also, as we are leaving the 2 girls at the front were just standing laughing, having a fun time on their phones giggling and laughing.  They both told good-bye and have a great night. My wife then responded back \"No one ever came to take our order!\"

We went down the street to ReHab Burger. Was greeted immediately and sat at a table. Server came within 1 minute and we had drinks on the table within 3 minutes.  If you actually want to drink \"cold beer\" and eat \"cheeseburgers\", I would go to ReHab instead."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, mac & cheese, and wide selection of beer!  They are now serving S'mores table side!  Perfect for lunch & happy hour!  Staff is awesome and they have great daily specials too!  Walls are covered with TV's with sports games on all day/night.  f you like watching sports, eating amazing food and drinking beer, this is the place for you.  Great for groups, families, day out on the town, or just to grab a bite.  CB2 won't disappoint.  Patio is dog friendly too!!!  :)"}
{"text":"Went here after a spring training game with a group of friends. The place was packed but we got right in. Server was nice and kept the drinks filled. I ordered a taco burger. It had chips, lettuce, salsa, sour cream, etc and I loved it!! Really great burgers. You can pick what bun you want too. The pretzel bun is my favorite. Fries were excellent as well!! Overall, we all loved the food and the quick service. The place is pretty big too. Tons of TVs which is great for sports. And some outdoor seating for cool days. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Went there for beers only. I ordered shock top. The waitress was very attentive and quickly provided my beers and check. I like the chill vibe and the deck is where to be! I would recommend this place for sports and beers. Didn't eat any food there so I can't speak to it."}
{"text":"Good food, great beer selection and extremely friendly staff.  Fun atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating.  Happening bar!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the cheeseburgers and sweet potato tots. Like most greasy spoons, it's easy to consume a 2000 calorie meal here, so watch what you eat. We prefer to split a burger during happy hour with no drinks... MUCH cheaper that way. Get your own food and down a couple of drinks and you'll easily hit $25 a person for a burger. No thanks. I'd rather not drink away my hard earned money at a 400% markup. YMMV"}
{"text":"We were lured into trying out Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers by their buy one get one free National Cheeseburger Day deal.  The burgers were ok at best and waaaayyyyy over priced for what they were.

The BBQ sauce is not good.  It has some weird vinegary taste and is super watery.  I had t o spend $2 extra for a pathetic side salad that was likely straight out of a bag.

I had to basically build my custom burger because they didn't have a guacamole bacon burger on the menu.  The equivalent burger at Rehab Burger Therapy is $12 and included sweet potato tots with all the (good) sauces you can dream of.  This crappy burger was smaller and ended up being $16.50 and tasted no different than those pre packaged costco patties.

I've learned my lesson and won't be cheating on Rehab anymore."}
{"text":"This is literally one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. We had a reservation for a large group, but they had us down for the wrong day, and they had to scramble to fit us in... The customer service was horrible, the manager was a jerk, and the food wasn't even good. Several people even had their food prepared incorrectly, but didn't bother sending it back for fear it would take another year to have it fixed. I actually ended up leaving before my food even came out... I had been seated for nearly 2 hours at that point, and I felt like a beggar asking for bites of other peoples' entr√©es. Other people in the group had their food brought out 45 min before I left... I went home, heated up my own food, and ate it before my some of my friends got their food at the restaurant. So ridiculous!!!! Please don't eat here."}
{"text":"Great location, great food, and great staff. With plenty of TV's, it is also the place to catch any game."}
{"text":"Solid but not spectacular burgers, meat could have been juicer and of a higher quality.  But the menu options, location, and atmosphere make it a top spot to visit next time your big game is on."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars because it didn't let me down, but it also didn't impress me. They have the Sonoran White Chocolate Ale on tap, which is my favorite beer of all time, so I give them some credit for having a good local beer selection. Overall, I liked the space, the patio is huge and great for warm days/nights. I wanted to sit outside, but I came with a larger group, 8 of us, and we were fortunate enough to find a table inside to accommodate us right before the UA v ASU basketball game. I ordered the CB&CB burger which was good, but doesn't rank as one of the best burgers I've ever had, but I would come back to grab a Sonoran Ale and watch another game."}
{"text":"Very cool place. Awesome atmosphere and good service during the meal. Food was really good. 
3 stars for the way the bill came. Was charged for fries ($2.00ea)  3 times (one should've been included in kids meal) and DIDN'T ORDER FRIES. DIDNT even receive fries. We got the complimentary chips with the burgers. Which were yummy. It was possibly a new waitress and didn't know the system yet but I didn't even realize it until I got home, so that's my fault. 
Hopefully next time we visit we will not be over charged because the place is really nice."}
{"text":"Good wings and cold beer aplenty.  Lots of TVs for all the games and attentive service.  What else do you want?  Just solid."}
{"text":"Liked that the kitchen is open til 12 on Sunday but I did not like the snarl and lack of expression on the bartenders face the entire time. I'm in the industry and understand we all have long shifts or don't want to be at work some days, but to create an experience making the guest feel not at all comfortable is enough to check the attitude at the door or call in grumpy. What I don't understand is, it is Sunday (what most industry peeps would like to call the beginning of their weekend). Smile girl, they are free and they do create a much more friendly and comfortable atmosphere for the guest."}
{"text":"Average. Quick lunch with a buddy and we stopped in for the namesake. Beer selection killer. Service decent, we sat at the bar. Environment wS intimate for a sports bar, could set see myself watching football here. Good was average. Kinda quirky and fun menu, execution left a bit to be desired. Went with buffalo potato chips and the pretzel. The pretzel was perfect, the cheese was average. I ate almost all of it so no complaints here. The chips were not good and I love wing sauce. Order two burgers; the juicy Lucy which was oddly cooked. It was burnt hard on the surface, well done on half and rare on the other. Like I said oddly cooked. Friends burger was fine but over cooked at well when ordered medrare. All gray no red/pink. 

I'll try the hot dogs next time or a sandwich. Overall it wasn't boom or bust. I wouldn't go out of my way..."}
{"text":"A fantastic spot to watch sports or have drinks with friends. Fun both during the day and at night. Patio gets crowded on nice days but when it's hot the misters are going. Tons of tvs to watch all different games and you can be both inside and outside. Good food and all reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place hands down has some of the best burgers. I absolutely love them, and the food never disappoints. However, the timeliness of service could be a little better. However,  most of the time they are completely packed, so I can understand and give them a \"pass\". This is a very casual dining experience and nice for a quick bite. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I met my buddy here for dinner last night and drinks. 

Ambiance:  I love that there were a zillion TVs so that no matter who sat where we could see the Bowl Game and Hockey Game without having to squint. I feel like it was pretty unusual to be so empty on a Friday night, but probably because the football game was being played in Tempe. The booth was very comfortable and noise level reasonable.

Food: We both had the Sleep Dog Red Rover draught to start and it was delicious. Seriously, one of the best beers I've drank in a long time. Lovely Irish Red. We waited to order until after the first beer and the waitress was very gracious. I ordered the Hangover Burger (I love over easy eggs on burgers, it's a thing for me) and my buddy had the Steakhouse Truffle Burger. Oh. My. God. We cut each burger in half and traded halves. I'm 36 and have never had a better burger. Just. Perfect. There really aren't words for how good they were. For dessert I had the Sonoran White Chocolate Ale. Another hit. 

Service:  Very kind, patient and friendly service from our waitress. She really was great. 

If you have out of town guests make sure to stop in here. They'll love Old Town and this place is great."}
{"text":"Nice staff, not the worst prices, good food and drink selection and nice setup for a sportsbar."}
{"text":"Food is yummy, huge beer selection, and you can always watch your favorite team here. (Go ASU!) 

Have been here many times. Tonight our server was Alison, and she is outstanding. Was attentive the whole night and very nice. We usually order the bacon burger, but tonight we got the club and it was delicious. And always get the tots!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection if you like IPA especially. Nice location, lots of TVs. Nice bar, can't vouch for the food as we were there only for a beer."}
{"text":"Second time in here. Both times food took forever on a random mid afternoon day... Sat at the bar this time, took a little while to get menus and talk to anybody, but that was not too much of a concern at first. We ordered two classic American burgers with a veggie patty instead, no crazy substitutions, shouldn't be hard to remember... After 20 minutes food came out, what do you know... Got turkey burgers instead! Sent those back, bartender admitted it was her fault (of course it was her fault- we're both vegetarians). Took another 20 minutes to remake the burgers. The bartender dipped out and didn't even offer to compensate for the long wait or say that she was passing us on to someone else. Would love to have tipped 20% but you need to take more care of your customers."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had. For sure need to come back and try the B.Y.O.M&C."}
{"text":"Watched the JSU/Auburn game here.  I only had an appetizer (the Totchos), but it was good. The bloody mary was spicy, just the way I like it. I'll come back because I really like their cheeseburgers, which I had at another location. I wish I'd eaten one on this visit because they looked so good."}
{"text":"Went over today for lunch. I got onion rings which were nice and crispy and buffalo sliders! They were delicious! More then enough chicken with perfect amount of sauce in it! My friend got the Tijuana torpedo hotdog & it was about a footling wrapped in bacon with slices of jalape√±o on one side and slices of tomato on the other side topped with onions! She loves that. Our server was very informative and was around when we needed her! We got a sample of 4beers in little mini mugs (sooo cute) which was $9 and helped us chose what exactly we wanted with our food. Overall food, service and drinks were Great! We will return! So much on the menu to chose from!"}
{"text":"Your usual burger array for a burger place. The draw here for me is the patio that sits on Scottsdale Road. Fantastic view and you never know what is going to cross your path. They call it eye candy, I think?

Staff tries hard but this joint can get off of the rails when it is really busy. I mean, service slows a bit. Clean and many Tv's for catching the games. A Spring Training Hangout for sure... recommended but after the game starts. Lol. #vino2ultimate #vinosquared"}
{"text":"Great build your own burgers, great build your own Mac and great beer selection. What more could you ask for! I love this place."}
{"text":"Sports bars with great service are bank in my book. Often, I visit ones where the rowdy action that's happening on TV and throughout the bar gives servers an excuse to neglect your dining needs or act hurried in their interactions, but I'm pleased to say Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers in Old Town Scottsdale is a great exception to this rule.

I went there recently to watch the Indiana Pacers beat the Miami Heat (woo!) and had a great time chilling out on the mister-filled patio. We had prime seating in front of a large flat-screen television and a cool view of Old Town Scottsdale. Now I know why the patio is constantly packed whenever I drive by - the place has great food, a killer happy hour, 25 TVs and service with a smile.

One of the things that's greatest about Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers is that their happy hour lasts until 7 p.m., and starts at 3 p.m. It features great specials, including $3 domestic pints and $5 appetizers. 

As the restaurant name implies, the beer list is huge, but my favorite part about the meal was the delicious grilled cheese sandwich and side salad. The sandwich comes with fries or chips for $8, and with my salad, it was only $10. This was great bar food, a huge portion, with three types of cheeses and tomato. I added avocado, which is my favorite way to have it. I was impressed with the fresh salad, and left taking half my sandwich home.

My companion's Turkey Burger ($12) also looked generous, and he said it tasted graet. I stole some of his sweet potato tots (an extra $2), and they were worth the splurge - perfectly crispy and, again, a massive portion that had him taking half the meal home. 

Throughout the night, I was pleasantly surprised any server that passed by our table checked on us. Servers should work as a team, helping out each other's tables with whatever they need, and that's the philosophy here - really impressive.

The atmosphere was fun, with friendly banter and cheering among tables for the games. It's casual and unpretentious, yet you'll feel valued and have a great meal. Also, be sure to \"check in\" on Yelp, Facebook or Twitter to score 10 percent off your bill."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place till I purchased a groupon. We will deff be going back. The food is amazing!! They have so many different kids of burgers you can choose from, great fries and even more amazing milkshakes. Oh and you can get adult milkshakes, which go amazing with any if their cheeseburgers."}
{"text":"Welcome to Old Town! What took you so long!? I've been anxiously watching the \"coming soon\" sign and waiting for Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers to open. Finally they did and last night we got to give it a try! This location has the sport's bar perfected. The \"concept\" is simple: Extensive beer list, cool drink concoctions, juicy burgers, accompanying snacks and TVs and seating everywhere you look. Throw in a spacious patio and you've got a perfect storm (in a good way). 

We stopped by around 8:30 pm on Friday night and saw that it was pretty packed so we thought we'd have to wait. However, thanks to the amount of seating they have, we didn't have to wait even a second! They seated us right away and my husband was in heaven thanks to the sports playing on the TVs everywhere we looked. 

The menu has plenty to choose from. Of course the burger is the way to go here, but they also had chicken sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc. The burger menu is long and if that's not enough, they also have a BYOB (build your own burger) option. Not feeling a burger? Give the BYOM (build your own mac n cheese) a try! First, we ordered the buffalo chicken dip. Wow. Absolutely delicious. I want to recreate this at home. It had the perfect kick to it. It came with chips, celery and carrots to dip. For the main course, I went for one of the \"favorites\" and got the Bacon Bleu Burger with french fries. Another wow! This burger is juicy goodness at its best. The burger is topped with bleu cheese, bacon, special mayo and caramelized onions. It is incredibly hearty and I could barely finish half. It would be easy to share. The french fries had a nice salty-peppery flavor to them. The food here is hearty and perfect if you're looking for a good All American meal. I've been wanting one of these restaurants to open in Old Town for awhile!

Before I stop, I need to talk about the drinks. They have some creative drink choices, include beer flights and a \"beer and a shot\" choice. For $9 you get a beer and accompanying shot pre-selected by the restaurant to compliment each other. It was a fun little activity before the meal! There are several beers on top and they also had a detailed cocktail list. 

I'll be seeing you again soon!"}
{"text":"I loved the hostess's (Olivia) they attended us right away and gave us seats to sit on while we waited for our actual seats that way we wouldn't miss the game. However the waitress was horrible. Although she was easy on the eyes, she had a pretty bad temper that was obvious. I suppose we weren't the easiest to work with because we made her wait a little to take our order but it was only our first time there. None the less it was still only two meals she had to bring us. Could have been an easy table and I love to tip really good but a tip is earned not a must..I just gave it to the hostess, who deserved it and then some. We both ordered the hangover with a side of fries and I thought the food was bland, definitely not worth what we had to pay. I hate to be the one giving bad reviews so for the sake of the business I will give them 4 stars...want to give them 2. Anyhow, I won't be going there ever again. Especially on game days."}
{"text":"Stopped by the other night after leaving a dive bar in the area. The truffle fries are AH-mazing. So many beers to choose from too! Definitely will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!! The \"O lineman\" burger will blow your mind!! It is a delicious patty of beef sandwiched between two grilled cheese sandwiches. It was amazing and could be a signature burger at anywhere in the valley. Go there, don't be shy, and give it a try!

Obviously the first part of this joints name is Cold Beers, and YES they live up to that. Their beer selection was very good. Local beers, small brewery beers, and obviously domestic and imports. I went with the lefthand milk stout and was not at all disappointed. 

With all the trendy places coming and going in downtown Scottsdale, I can see this being a place that is there to stay. Go check it out because seeing is believing."}
{"text":"Yummy Mac & cheese & burgers! We did BYOM with Jalape√±os, bacon & red pepper. Delish!! Great drinks selection & atmosphere! Big patio! Enjoy meeting friends here! I will be back"}
{"text":"Love this place! It has so many beers on tap and the food is amazing! Happy Hour is the best here and I believe it is until 7. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The craziest thing is, I would normally never consciously pick a bar like this....just not my scene. However, after a work happy hour, my expectations are quite the opposite now. 
Along with their great menu of beers and drinks, they have one of the better veggie burgers in town! Seriously...even hand pattied! It's a generous meal, and the side of fries is belly filling. 

Service has always been very good and prompt. Seating can be a challenge especially if there's any kind of important sporting event on TV."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Old Town. Such a great atmosphere the staff is always friendly. My salad was amazing and you can never go wrong with a side of sweet tots."}
{"text":"This is the best place in old town to grab a burger. Everyone talks up rehab burgers, but don't be fooled. If you want to sit in a fun environment with a view of every game possible, cold beer and cheeseburgers is your place! They also have a large outdoor porch and more tvs than most bars in town."}
{"text":"To preface this, we have come to Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers about 8 times now. Maybe half of which were to watch a sporting event and the other half to hang out with friends and family. 

First off, the name tells you exactly what you're getting. Cheeseburgers and cold beer, which I haven't had a bad burger or warm glass of beer there yet, so they are definitely living up to their name. However, if you feel like getting wild, the Buffalo Chicken Dip is freaking delicious. 
Aside from the awesome food, the service has always been awesome for us. Between the locations at Greyhawk and Old Town, we have never had a bad service experience. Special kudos go to the Old Town location though, because every bartender interaction we have ever had there has always been positive.. particularly with Scott and Jaclyn (Jacqueline? not sure if I spelled her name correctly) but regardless, they are both badass. 

In summary, good food, great people, fun times... this place rocks."}
{"text":"Great service, food and beer selection.   Much better than your average bar food. Nice location and very good service.  Will return."}
{"text":"Came upon this place since the kitchen at the bar next door was closed, late night. The bartender was awesome- really friendly and cool. Their sliders were delicious- served with a good au jus for dipping (3 per order) and we would def go back here!"}
{"text":"Food good but management unprofessional just plain ignorant.  Went  for Super Bowl owner had 5 four top tables reserved. know because I asked why a waiting list when there were all those tables. could not get a seat after getting there two hours earlier.  Called weeks prior to reserve a table but was told it would be first come first serve."}
{"text":"Burgers are EXCELLENT!! Don't waste the 9.00 on the dry Parmesan truffle fries however- so dry the extra requested sauce couldn't even make them palatable.  Our waitress was hating her job tonight and was very annoyed to wait on is, but hopefully she is the exception not the norm. High energy here so will give it another try."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first visit to watch the UFC fight.  
I really appreciate the great service even when the restaurant was completely busy for the fight.  After the fight we stayed a bit longer to have some more beers and enjoy the patio.  They do a great job with misters and fans to keep the patio cool, even in July. 

Besides the great beer selection and the service.  The burgers, wings, humus, cbcb salad were all very good.  Everyone in our group enjoyed their meal and drinks!!!

We will all return again soon!"}
{"text":"My daughter ordered me a medium rare American cheeseburger for takeout to bring home to me. The outside was cooked enough, but the inside was so pink it was mooing at me. If I was sitting down at dinner there I definitely would've sent it back. I had to put it in my frying pan to cook it more so I wouldn't get sick."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. I ordered grilled asparagus and it's not throughout cooked.  I waited for an hour to go order my food! Then, waited for half hour to get my food."}
{"text":"Great service by Breana and excellent burger sliders, mozzarella sticks and build your own burger. Great restaurant for befOre our softball game."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is so unique and delicious.  And the beer selection is full of variety, which I really like."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a solid four stars, because between the $5 yelp check in deal + happy hour prices, my burger and beer were less than $10 WITH a generous tip!  The beer was cold, as advertised, and the burger was tasty.  Not the best I've ever had by any means, but a solid cheeseburger worthy of being included in the namesake.  Our waitress was on top of it, despite having what appeared to be ten different groups she was waiting on, and the crowd was a nice mix of Scottsdale randoms.  

It's possible that I'm giving the 4th star due to the company I was surrounded by (Rick / Jon / Amy / Jolly / Heath / Laura / Jeff / Becky) - we shared some very interesting conversation as a little sendoff for our pal Rick who was visiting from N.C.  On this day, we learned that there are still people in their 30's rocking aol e-mail addresses... HA!  Definitely worth checking this place out, it's a solid option in old town Scottsdale, especially if you're trying to watch a game!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! We had the veggie burger, BYO Mac n cheese, and hummus plate! All delicious!"}
{"text":"Best service!  I loved the outdoor seating area. The Buffalo Chicken dip is 2 thumbs up.  They have an extensive beer menu.  And so many burgers to choose from-  had the Arizona burger, Mac and Cheese burger, 1000 island Burger and the Open Pit Burger.  YUMMY.  Lots of TVs for those wanting to watch sports."}

Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers

Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers you can't get anymore blunt than that!

I came on a late Saturday bar hopping night.  Yeah I'll admit I was a tad bit tipsy, but I made my way there.  As I looked at the menu I couldn't help but noticed they served a Juicy Lucy!  Thanks Food Network, now I'm hooked so I went for it!  Overall, not a bad attempt at all.  The burger was crisp-charred on the outside and a perfect crunch to a soft and cheesy middle.  The condiments seem freshly sliced and the fries were good.  They actually tasted amazing, but I gather by that time the alcohol in me was kicking in and needed something carby!  

The atmosphere at the time was winding down, but I gather this place can get kicking.  Located right on the strip of Oldtown Scottsdale, I'm sure this place gets many hits a night.  Plus, they have a great select of draft beers and a lot TVs to get your sporting event on.  In the end, this place rocks - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is super fun and has a nice vibe to it. Clearly a sports bar, with several TVs mounted on the walls. The gluten free menu was quite large which I loved and had a lot of selections. I enjoyed this dining experience and would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch really excited because of the huge beer selection and the buffalo chicken dip.  I had never seen buffalo chicken dip on a menu before, but I make it at home all the time and I had to see how it would compare.  The dip was super dry.  It was like someone took some chicken and the cheapest hot sauce they could find and put it into a food processor.  Not good.  They did have good chips though.  
The beer flights were predetermined, but I would love to see a \"build your own\".  I also thought the service was super slow and my friends DIY bloody mary was served in a tiny glass with so much vodka there was no room for all the toppings (it was something like 10 bucks too).  Overall not worth the money.  There are just too many interesting food spots there to waste your time on mediocre food even with the extensive beer selection."}
{"text":"Deliver on what they promise. Great appetizers and burgers. Fun environment to spend an afternoon drinking with friends. Yelp check in = $5 off = Free appetizer or round."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great burgers and tater tots, a ton of beer selections on tap and great service.  Their patio facing Scottsdale Rd is a fun place to hang out and they have so many TVs you could probably watch every football game being played at one time on Sundays."}
{"text":"I loved the BYOB deal on Wednesday! The burger was juicy and delicious! Plenty of beers on tap. You can't go wrong with this place..tons of toppings to choose from to build your masterpiece"}
{"text":"Just left this place - great experience! I wish I could remember our servers name - sweet blonde girl who took amazing care of us! I'm always nervous to dine anywhere with my 1 year old in Old Town because you never know which establishments are truly \"kid friendly\". This one most certainly is - our server went above and beyond for our little one which really makes for an easier dining experience with a toddler who bores easily. Hell Fire chips and the Juicy Lucy burger were AMAZING. We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"We came back again. But this time Mom and I brought 2 of my other sisters along. I had higher expectations for my second visit. NOPE. I did order the Grilled Asparagus which I wanted to try from my last visit. What a disappointment! I received 6 very thin and shriveled spears. SIX! The flavor was good but definitely not worth the 7 or 8 bucks I spent on it. I was expecting big thick plump spears and more than 6. That is highway robbery and only reflects greed upon investors/management. I don't mind spending 12 dollars for a burger because they are flavorful, juicy, and worth the money. But the Grilled Aspargus experience has really turned me off and put negative thoughts in my mind about the people behind Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers. Once again, it took forever for us to receive our check. Pretty sure we won't return."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place less than a three but more than a two. 

In short the service is average. The portion sizes were weak, the hummus especially. It should be called pita and vegetables with a little bit of hummus on the side. The Buffalo Dip looked pretty unappealing and while the flavor was alright the texture was what I assume dog food would feel like if I ate it."}
{"text":"Been here four times now... First time made a great impression. Mom got the Prime dip and I got the chili mac with the intention of us splitting each dish to try. When lunch came out, we devoured the chili mac without even touching the prime dip. It was soooooo delicious! Boxed up the prime dip and mom took it home to dad. Even after the trip back home to the west side, dad said it was still really good. Second time wasn't as good of an experience. My husband and I came on a Saturday night and it was a disaster. Employees were hanging out at the bar, taking up at least 5-6 seats at the bar, drunk and being obnoxious. The place was packed and management didn't ask them to make room for customers. On top of that, a man sitting at a table on the patio with a group of people kept coming back behind the bar getting himself and his friends drinks. I'm not sure if he was an owner or manager, but regardless, not setting a good example for the employees. Third time I came for my birthday lunch. Had a great time with great service. The tot-chos are Aaa-ma-zzzzing! I could've eaten the whole plate! Shared the rocky point burger (it's huge) and it was 'good'. Fourth time, again came for lunch. Sat at the bar with a fairly busy lunch crowd. The manager had to tell the two bartenders, who were apparently involved in a very interesting conversation, to bring us menus. Once they realized we were there, service was terrific. Of course had the tot-chos again and devoured them. Had the Monterey chicken sandwich and it was really good. Overall, I think if you come here for lunch, you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for a place to grab a bite on a weekend night, come early or be prepared to get ice thrown at you and drinks spilled all over the bar."}
{"text":"I'm sure this place is a happening spot during sports games but if you're looking for a weeknight dinner, I wouldn't come here. In the 30 minutes we were there, not one server came to our table to greet us or take our drink order let alone our meal order. I actually asked the hostess to have a server come over and after waiting an additional 15 minutes, we decided to leave. Never in my life have I had an experience like this- I was absolutely livid! What kind of a restaurant, which wasn't busy at all the night I went in, wouldn't have someone come over at all in 30 minutes?! 

I really was excited to try Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers but now, I will never come back or recommend anyone go there."}
{"text":"Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers was.. ok. I ordered the truffle burger and I'm used to truffle burgers being a bit over the top when it comes to flavor, but this one left something to be desired. The chips on the side were pretty good, though. 

We also ordered the asparagus appetizer, which was fresh and delicious 
- I loved the grilled tomato on the side - and my boyfriend enjoyed his burger. He got onion rings rather than chips for a $2 up-charge, and the onion rings were really good. Maybe I just didn't order the right thing... but how can you go wrong with a truffle burger?!

The service was horrible and made us feel like we had been forgotten about. I know people who have been here and who liked it, but I just can't relate after the experience we had."}
{"text":"For a place that specializes in burgers I was expecting more. After waiting an hour for our meal, the beef burgers were eh, OK, and the veggie burger was unappetizing--all rice, falling apart, and bland. I needed a fork to eat a burger. The waitress stopped by a total of 6 times in a 2 hour period. I will not be coming back to this over priced waiting lounge."}
{"text":"Why can't people cook burgers properly.  Medium rare is not fully cooked and dry. Even more importantly, if the burger is split and the server can see it's fully cooked and not the slightest bit pink why serve it? And when did it become to much for a server to ask how is everything? I had to ask three times to get a glass of water. The two stars is because the beer selection was good. But not good enough to go back."}
{"text":"I ordered through postmates since we didn't want to drive over there. I got the buffalo chicken dip and the teriyaki which wings. Now, I love buffalo flavored anything, but when I ate this dip my mouth and stomach went up in flames. It was SO spicy, which to me took away some of the flavor. Also, I only got the chips and not the veggies, which was a disappointment.  Maybe next time we will actually go in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The location and patio are great but I had poor service. We had to go find our own napkins and silverware. Our waitress would disappear for long periods of time not refilling our drinks. The food took an hour to get out to us and was poorly put together. Overall I was disappointed."}
{"text":"We went to the new Central Phoenix location.  The server was friendly, but it took 45 minutes for us to get our food.  Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"I don't know if the kitchen was having an \"off\" night or what, but the turkey burger was the consistency of pate (mushed chicken liver). I could have spread it on a cracker.  Took a few bites and gave up. 

Beer specials, fries, and the atmosphere were nice, but I wouldn't attempt ordering a burger here again."}
{"text":"My vegetarian girlfriend and I decided to go out for a late night bike ride to have dinner at a place with a patio. We settled on this place because of the reverse happy hour ($5 apps) and the veggie burger.

Although the table sign and tv's both mentioned the reverse happy hour and $5 apps, no go because it's summer? I would think you would have specials in the summer as it was 11:30 PM and it was still 101¬∞ F. Argh

I let the gf order first and we were told they were out of veggie patties. We asked for a pretzel ($5 for one - $5 for two for reverse happy hour) prior to this and we said we will need a minute. The waitress came back and I asked to pay and we will eat our pretzel before we go. Paid, signed and then our pretzel came. Took about 25 minutes.

The pretzel was great and the cheese dip was familiar (likely a shelf brand) but it was good. Had to ask for napkins and the music was so loud that we hard a hard time hearing each other.

A disappointment."}
{"text":"I went back and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food and service. This place is a must for burger lovers and SPORTS! Thank you for a great time!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located conveniently on Scottsdale Rd (old town) near Indian School! Great outdoor patio. Unfortunately it did take 5 minutes just for my waitress to greet me. Food was absolutely great. Ordered the American burger, with chips. Very difficult to eat without the burger coming apart, which is a good thing! Pricing is alright. The outdoor seating really sold me on the place. Great for a small group of friends to watch sports."}
{"text":"Super fun and friendly place! Went out of their way to find a soccer match we wanted to see (even changing their TV from Direct TV to Cox to find it). Had appetizers and drinks and everything was really good!"}
{"text":"Came here for football Sunday A couple days ago visiting from New York . Bad ass sports bar with amazing food , drink specials and great service. They had all the tvs labeled with the games that were going to be played for the day. Show up early and get a good spot"}
{"text":"One of the most fun places to bring a group of friends! Good food.  Cheap enough beer! And there are tvs! Whoooop whooooop!"}
{"text":"It's too bad yelp doesn't have a link that says \"this reviewer sounds like an asshole\" next to \"useful\".....

Regardless of what another recent reviewer thinks of Scottsdale in general and CBCB in particular, this place has a great vibe and really good food and yes, an extensive list of very cold beer.  Plenty of large screen TVs for game-watching or date-ignoring. Very reasonable prices (for Scottsdale) and I've always experienced good service even when they are busy. 

I've eaten here on a number of occasions, including today, and have never been disappointed by either the food or the staff. If you're nice to people they're generally nice back.... Kinda makes you wonder *why* someone might get rude behavior, doesn't it?

For the record I do NOT work for CBCB, my tits are real, I don't have a spray tan nor do I drive a BMW, and if you don't like Scottsdale don't come here with your bad attitude and then slam on our restaurants."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, lots of TVs, burger cooked perfect, medium. Staff seems nice. 

This place has a very nice open atmosphere. Open windows and patio. 

Park at the garage behind because it's adjacent to the place."}
{"text":"Monday night Build your own Mac and cheese is excellent! The burgers are all great too. This place has a million TVs and is a great place for groups!"}
{"text":"The place is fantastic. I went in just to have a beer with a friend, but after looking at the menu and seeing the burgers being served I had to order a burger! I ordered the The Jucy Lucy-fer burger and it was great! Servers were all very nice."}
{"text":"Had the juicy Lucy it was good but the drinks were weak af. I had a Red Bull vodka and the bf had a jack and coke, it was as if she skipped the alcohol. But I have to admit the tater tots were to die for. So stick to the cheeseburgers and beer...if you're looking for a buzz don't bother going."}
{"text":"The last time I went to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers, in the end I got a tasty burger, but it the service was absolutely horrible. I went with a group of friends, and when we went to order, I was last. The person before me was celebrating his birthday, and ordered the giant burger that he had 2 minutes to finish to get it free (and I'm sure his picture on the wall). The waitress went and got the manager to come explain how it worked depending on how many patties he ordered on the burger. 

While doing this, the waitress appeared to forget about me, which I can understand, but every time she came by and checked in, I was ignored. She would as how we are doing and as I would try to speak up to get her attention, or even raise my hand, she was already walking away. 

Everyone else at the table had their drinks, and food. When the manager brought over the giant burger for my friend, I told him that all my friends were finishing up with their food, and I hadn't even gotten a drink. 

He asked what I wanted and said he would make sure the waitress was made aware of the situation and properly trained. Before I got my burger (all my friends were done with theirs, and the one who was celebrating his birthday finished his giant birthday burger) I was given the check for a burger that wasn't even given to me yet! Then the waitress had the audacity to come back and ask for my card so I could pay for the burger! I still hadn't been served it yet!

When the manager came back, I thought he was going to apologize, and offer me something for the atrocious service I was given. Instead he told the group he was heading a scavenger hunt contest (or something) and wanted us to go. 

I finally received my burger, and ate it as quick as possible (because now my friends were waiting on me to leave), without any apology from the waitress, or discount from the restaurant.  

When you are the manager, receive a complaint, confirm that your staff made a mistake, do nothing to rectify the situation, and allow your patron to be insulted even further, it shows what you think of your customers."}
{"text":"Went in this week for lunch and I was greeted by a lovely young lady by the name of Tara who was working the bar. She was warm, personable but importantly, VERY knowledgable regarding food and drinks. She didn't mind spending a few minutes helping me decide what to order for lunch. 

I will absolutely come back here for lunch. And Tara's level of service is the reason I'm coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here at this fun establishment. It was busy because of March Madness games and spring training yet We were seated right away. 

This place has a fun atmosphere. There is music playing when the games are not playing on the tv. My server was great. Even though her area was busy she still checked in often and was always refilling our drinks. There were a few issues with my food but the back of the house manager took care of the issues. He was very professional and nice. 

They had enough staff working so waiting was not an issue when it came to getting food. 

The chips with the buffalo sauce are super spicy or hot however you want to call it. Plus the portion is Huge!!! I would only recommend this if you like spicy stuff plus you have more than one person eating with you."}
{"text":"The burgers here were amazing! The service was great and it was so fun to sit outside. I forgot my raybans on the table when we left. I came back an hour later and they had them for be. So thankful! Will be back next time I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"Have gone here twice in July and have loved the service and food! Not only amazing MAC N CHEESE and burgers but also a great beer selection. A friend of mine ordered a burger that had two grilled cheeses as the bun. Literally insane, he loved every bite. Jordan, our server, served us both times and was very attentive and even remembered us. Perfect location for people wanting to go out in Old Town and enjoy a great atmosphere with great food and drink. I believe it was the manager, but he was also very attentive in making sure we were okay and had everything we needed. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I had the All American Burger for happy hour and it was Excellent!  The staff was extremely knowledgeable and all were very friendly and helpful.  I will be coming here for sure to satisfy my next burger craving.!"}
{"text":"Never has a name been so true to its mission of Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers.  We stopped by on a warm June night and enjoyed the cool mister covered patio.  TV's galore, a cheerful server and great bar food.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED: If you like watching live sports with an ice cold beer and a big, juicy cheeseburger, look no farther than CBCB.   Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers is an instant classic. Their handcrafted menu paired with one of the Valley's best beer selection is sure to make even the toughest critics mouth start to water.  The crowd has an electrifying energy throughout, especially on big sporting event nights.

Improving on the original North Scottsdale took some serious effort but the Old Town spot is the CBCB Flagship locale.  The wait staff and bartenders are knowledgeable and super friendly.  If you get lucky or ask, be sure to get seated in Miranda's section...  Miranda is the best!

There is adequate public parking directly behind CBCB or take an uber.

The Cheeseburgers are great and I really enjoyed the tater tots.  I'll be back sooner than later."}
{"text":"Every time I have come here we have really loved the burgers. This is a great spot to grab a burger, fries and beer. Super relaxed atmosphere and most of the time you will probably run into someone you know as well haha"}
{"text":"Seems like a cool place to watch a game. Plenty of beers to select.  TVs everywhere. I didn't eat but menu just ok.  Standard bar food but I could be wrong.  If it's beers and a game your after, I reckon this place would be alright!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try out a place called cold beer and cheeseburgers. The beer was good and cold for sure. I had a Hummus appetizer and buffalo chicken sliders. I have to say I may have a new favorite place to obsess about for the next 6 months. Great location and is a really nice place. I went to the new location in North Scottsdale and not the one in old town Scottsdale"}
{"text":"We go there every Saturday during football season. Never disappointed!  Great food and great service every time."}
{"text":"Great sports bar. I had the pastrami Rueben sandwich with the Cesar salad and both were great. Service was on point. Good beer selection and they have a 10% off Yelp coupon when checking in. I will be returning."}
{"text":"During a relaxing day in Scottsdale, we decided to be hungry. And then we came upon Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers. The name is awesome because that is exactly what you get! Cant go wrong there. 
We had to drink each of us a sour (Mine was the Cucumber Crush by 10barrels from Bend) and it was the best beer I have had. So good! I love a good sour. Ok, I am getting off track. We dithered between BTOM (Build Your Own Mac and Cheese) or BYOB (Build Yor Own Burger) and opted for another burger though we had had some the day before. Hey, I like burgers. :)
Ours that we built had peanut butter, bleu cheese, bacon, on a pretzel bun with jalapenos. It was tasty! And cooked well done just like we need. So the moral of this story is that you need to come here and put burgers into your face hole. Beers, too."}
{"text":"Loud and crazy! And the perfect burger and cccccccold beers.  Yep, seriously good burger! We each ate the whole damn thing ;)"}
{"text":"Game is pretty tight here. They do many things well. Long beer list (although most are standard macro brew defections), some excellent menu items (totchos!) and specials (Monday Mac and cheese). Lots of tvs that are viewable from almost all seats. Also trivia on Thursdays!"}
{"text":"I thought that the service was as good as it needed to be for the atmosphere. I am really surprised reading some of these reviews that people thought this place was anything but great. When you walk in, you get a kind of indoor/outdoor bar feeling (like the old town party areas). Attractive staff, LOTS of beer selection. The burgers though - fantastic.... This place is exactly what it is called... Cold beers and cheeseburgers. And the cheeseburgers- soooo good. I will definitely return next time I am in town. Great place to watch a game btw."}
{"text":"Finally decided to check this place out and now we can't stop coming back! If you're like me, you live for a good cheeseburger. The nice cold beer on the side is just the icing on top!! I've liked everything that I've tried here. The first time I came I was just so overwhelmed because there are sooo many options to choose from! These aren't your typical cheeseburgers, they have a PB&J one (haven't tried it yet!), a burger with mac and cheese on it, a burger with French fries in it! That's one of the things that keeps me coming back because there are so many good things to choose from! Some other things they have but I haven't tried yet include sandwiches and build your own mac and cheese. The only reason I gave 4/5 stars is because service could use some improvement."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Fantastic  burgers! Ferocious beer selection! Great open vibe with a great open atmosphere. The Bar tender Erin the bar tender is top notch! Great service, service great advice( since we came on a Wednesday  where it's all the to ping you want for only $11, which is completely worth it!) And not to mention her amazing personality. So cheers to you cold beer and cheeseburgers! You,ve lived up to your name and exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere. Has a bunch of good quality HDTVs. Great place to watch a game and eat some bar food. There is a huge selection of really unique burgers on the menu. They also have a huge section of burgers. The burger was good, not extremely good though."}
{"text":"Wow! Stopped by while visiting a friend and now I'd anyone goes to Scottsdale I am sending them straight here. Their Mac and cheese burger was average, but their Totchos: aka Nacho toppings on top of tater tots were to die for!"}
{"text":"Another place that has been on my hit list for a while now.  They have a location up in the Pinnacle Peak & Grayhawk area and when I heard they were coming down to Old Town, I had to come try it for myself. 

We walked into the joint and sat down at the bar.  The bartenders here are very friendly and helped us navigate the menu and gave us some suggestions.  We decided to order:

Hot & Smokey Mac & Cheese, $12

While we waited for the food, I ordered a pint of Lagunitas IPA, $6....one of my favorite IPA's.

The food came out a short time later.  The first thing I did was try the Hot & Smokey Mac & Cheese....and holy smokes, it was delish!  Not only that, but it really was spicy too...and smokey!  I also had a bite of the Chili Mac & Cheese...that was ridiculously good as well!

Next, I tried the Sliders....had the Cheeseburger Slider first....also very well prepared and full of flavor.  The Prime Rib Sliders were just as good and the Horseradish Sauce was a zinger that added to the flavor!  We were very impressed with this place.

After dinner we watched some baseball and had another Beer.  Good times down here...can't wait to come back.

Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"Great food. \"Cold\" beers. 

I use \"\" around cold- because the beer is cold but the glasses are not. Obviously it's SaintPatricks day so they're selling tons of beer and the glasses cannot get cold so I won't use that to rate against them. 

Friendly staff. Quick seating for today's wait time. Tons of cute guys and lots of NCAA March Madness on the screens. 

Have eaten from their food truck plenty of times- but first time in the restaurant and absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy the tator tots and hamburgers.  I had the Mac and cheese burger and it was perfect.....only bad thing is that it is so big.  Everyone had to get a take out box for leftovers, not really good if you were planning on shopping or hanging out in Scottsdale after dinner."}
{"text":"Do NOT come here! My friends and I went here to eat on 2-3-2016 and we all got really bad food poisoning! One of my friends got it really bad and was vomiting with diarrhea after an hour of leaving this place! The next day our employee immediately had her emitted to urgent care where she was checked and had samples done showing that it was in fact food poisoning! She called this facility and the manager admitted to the meat not being up to proper health standard grade and told her that he would pay for medical bills as long as she does not post anything on social media about this establishment giving her hazardous food. We just left this establishment as we handed them the medical bills and they refused to pay $75 for the medical visit and $50 for the medicines...instead we were reimbursed for only $20 of the meal. We are having an attorney handle this case. But please be aware and avoid!"}
{"text":"Tried this place after a recommendation. Went to the one up north but that was closed but to check out the one in old town (website didn't mention construction and that the old town was coming soon).
We ordered two burgers medium rare. A food runner came out and set our orders on the table with no word and a grumpy face.  Our burgers were well done. We would have complained if our server ever actually came around to see how we were doing. We were too hungry so we ate the burgers regardless. I would say they were average nothing too exciting. 
As we were almost finished the server finally came around to bring us a condiment tray saying \"sorry you never got one guess its too late huh.\"  
For two beers and two burgers and no refills on our waters at almost $38 I'd say its definitely not worth it. The only good part was the beer and the fact they came out quickly. 
If you're going to be a burger joint and have a graphic representation of burger temps on your menu your cooks better know how to cook a burger."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I finally checked this place out after walking past it in Old Town. They have a great open atmosphere that opens up to a nice outdoor patio, and a nice sports bar feel showing baseball, hockey, and trivia on their many tvs. Every time I walk by it is super busy so I had high hopes.

We came in right before 8pm on a Thursday which they have trivia night! Our waitress was friendly but seemed rushed which I understand because it was pretty busy, didn't have a ton of time to check out the menus but they seemed to have a pretty good variety of burgers, sandwiches, mac and cheese, and of course cold beer! I got the American burger which wasn't bad, it did not have a ton of flavor but came on a quality bun with gooey cheese, it came with homemade chips on the side which were a nice surprise! My boyfriend got the Hangover burger which had a fried egg on it, he seemed to love it and his lager! I got the Southern Bound cocktail, it was grapefruit vodka, lemonade, and soda water.

Overall I would try this place again, I really want to try the mac and cheese next time!"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome sports bar if your in the area. They have a large selection of beers and a nice selection of food. 

My reason for not leaving 5 stars is that our service on Sunday night was slow, we never even got napkins or silverware until about 10 mins after our food arrived. My friends burger was made incorrectly, my lady friends drink was also made wrong. After we let our waitress know, she corrected their order. So other than those couple mistakes everything was great.

Ill definitly come back next time im in the area."}
{"text":"To quote Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction, \"thats a tasty burger\". 5 stars on the burger and service, 3 stars on the overly salted tater tots, and 3 stars for the loud music. I will go back for their burgers! Friend and I split a specialty  cheese burger and it was outstanding. Onion rings looked pretty tasty also."}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly, food came out just as ordered. Husband had the blue cheeseburger. It was perfectly cooked and the tots were delicious as always. Oldest son had the buffalo chicken burger with h onion rings. He was very pleased. The kids mac and cheese is a good size portion but it was barely warm and a bit bland but our little boy didn't notice."}
{"text":"Best tater tots and the crowd is always fun.  Service is great and prices are on point."}
{"text":"Wait was way too long. The food was hot and fresh when it finally came. Not my favorite place"}
{"text":"My first visit here and it was a great time. The food was delicious! Bar staff were fun to talk with. Had some good laughs with locals and other people hanging out. The tots were my FAVE! The mac and cheese was so good.. Can't wait to go again next visit."}
{"text":"Great spot to watch football when in town meeting up with friends. Its bar food, but pretty good. Not too \"Scottsdalish\", but still plenty to see"}
{"text":"Great service and the best burger I ever had. I had the Juicy Lucy. Soooo good. We did a beer bucket too. Such a fun atmosphere and the hell fire chips are a great starter if you're into spicy!!!! I would go here again."}
{"text":"I didn't really like this place. They have a good selection of beers and food, but I tried their hummus and was very disappointed. I don't think it is difficult to make hummus and it's usually a pretty safe choice at bars, but not at this one. 

Their burgers or mac and cheese seems like the bigger hits at this place.

This is a very typical bar, I don't really feel like it has anything special and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Seriously? This is your burger?  Honestly id rather go to Wendys. First off the burger is not top shelf meat, not seasoned, served on a subpar bun w shredded lettuce.  Shredded lettuce on a\"gourmet\" burger?  If you want to watch a game and have a beer its perfectly fine but if you want some solid food dont waste your time."}
{"text":"Love this place! One of the best spots in town to post up for a full day of football viewing.  Great staff, TVs and amazing burgers!!"}
{"text":"Bummer. We used to go to CB&C years ago and liked it just fine. Then service and quality seemed to taper off so we stopped going--nothing terrible, we just weren't drawn back. So then recently someone told us they were back and it's great again! So we gave it another shot and it was pretty good! Due to happy hour and the other specials we made it our Wednesday spot.

Sadly, we started running into little issues again, most of which were handled by staff or management--but not today. Our server obviously didn't want to be there. It wasn't that busy but we waited a long time for our food when the table next to us came in well after us and got their food minutes after we did. My burger was all but cold. Our server didn't come back before happy hour was over (or much at all so I had to get up and go find silverware on my own) so I only got one drink--that's not a big deal, but then she charged me full price for the drink I did get during happy hour which is the same drink I always get a happy hour discount on. When I asked about it, she just told me I was wrong.  

Some wasted time and a few bucks really doesn't sound like that big of a deal, but it's enough to keep us from going back."}
{"text":"This places looks like a lot of fun for a sports bar, only if the service was maybe mediocre. Went on a Tuesday night and had a decent amount of people on the patio where we sat. Took the waitress 20 min just to come get our drink order and my gf placed a food order right away as well. Food and drinks came out about 20 min later by a busser/food runner. Waitress came by for a split second 15 min later to see how food was and I wanted to order another beer and she completely ignored me and the table of 6 sitting behind us, they got so mad that they left. We had waited another 20 min just to give her a chance to come back so we can get the check, nope she was Mia so I went to the front and asked the hostess to find our waitress because we wanted to leave the service was so intolerable. Finally she came back we gave her a credit card and that again took another 20 minutes to process, she eventually came back to apologize but at that point it was too late, the experience there was ruined and we wouldn't come back or recommend to anyone else"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and food was really good. Tera and Kelsey were awesome bartenders."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE IVE EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I had to chase down waiters  to get water, menu, order and get my check. I might as well have made my own food."}
{"text":"I just had the best experience at the Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers on Scottsdale road. The food is great, the 43 large screens create excitement for sports lovers, but I wanted to say something about the staff that served me.

Management ( Charles ) could not do enough for his customers! He was so great and cares deeply about every single person that walks thru his doors. What a fine professional.

I was served by two of the hardest working ladies behind the bar. What struck me was how they made me feel at home immediately. They took time to talk and their smiles are only outdone by their sweet hearts. I would publicly like to than Kim and Nina for making a sad day great for me. 

I can't say enough about the staff, the experience, food and most important I met 3 people that cared. I had a special day thanks to them."}
{"text":"Wow! Absolutely Delish! I am visiting from Las Vegas and had an absolutely great meal and excellent service from Erin! Started off with the tarot-cho... Amazing, had the hangover burger with the chips(hot w/bluecheese) Amazing and even did the adult deserts.. Amazing, and I don't even like desserts. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice setting in Scottsdale. Nice beer selection although they were out of Shandy for my lite beer flight. Actually went veggie burger. It was OK, sorry I gave up meat for a while now. The onion rings were slammin'"}
{"text":"I dined alone at this sports bar/brewery in Old Town Scottsdale.  I must say that I was not made to feel welcome by the hostess.  Getting the \"just one?\" sneer and the \"this is the only place I can put you\" dismissal (referring to a table that was near the door and close to a neighboring one) when I said I wanted a table and not a place at the bar was disappointing.  [Note: I usually read on my iPad when I dine alone and there's simply not enough room at the bar for me, the plates, and the device, so I prefer a table.]  I really did not appreciate that.

That said, the burger I got, CB&CB, was pretty good with caramelized onions, pickles, and a subtle aioli.  Best of all, it was grilled to a perfect medium rare - the way I like it.  I love burgers and I like them medium rare and absolutely hate it when the restaurant insists on serving it medium well; the chefs should run the kitchen, not the lawyers - but I digress.  I opted for the tater tots.  They were perfect, and a nice reminder of what my mom prepared when I was a little boy, but these were much better than the ones she used to put into the oven frozen!  They had a perfect crunch; it's nice that they're making a comeback!

The beer menu is extensive and there are lots of TVs to watch various sports events (including a disgusting UFC bout - isn't there enough violence in the world these days without that?).

Once I was seated, the service was pretty good.  The server was friendly, although it took a bit of time to get some extra aioli.  There was an odd smell in the restaurant, almost like cigarette smoke from the old days, although the hostess insisted that smoking is not allowed.  

All-in-all, the food is good but the overall experience was a bit less so.  If Yelp allowed separate ratings for service and food, the service would only get one star from me because of the hostess (not the waitress)."}
{"text":"Place is extremely loud regardless if you eat outside or inside.  Hamburgers are nothing memorable.  However the truffle fries and their homemade chips are awesome!

Update::: have been multiple times! One best burger places in scottsdale!!!!! Though noise is still issue however go during slower times its not an issue!"}
{"text":"We sat on the patio and Ally was our server.  She recommended some great dishes and took good care of us.  When happy hour started she made sure that we knew and hooked us up with additional drinks.  

This place was amazing.  The ambiance and the food was amazing.  Highly recommend.  Sit in Ally's section for amazing service!!!"}
{"text":"Amaaazziinnggg burgers. Was my first and probably only time here on business.  I had the open pit and it was literally incredible. I don't know why this place only has 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I dropped by Scottsdale Arizona on the way back to California and found this restaurant. There happened to be a parade taking place that same day so it was pretty crowded. They have a patio sitting area looking out into the streets. Perfect spot for the parade.
They specialize in burgers and beer. They have an option to build your own burger.
Good variety of beer to chose from. Here's our comments on specific dishes:

1) Asian Chicken salad - I love peanut sauce and bits of fried wonton skin so it totally worked out for me. They didn't over kill on the dressing so I would highly recommend the salad.

2) The Staple Mac & Cheese - They used three different types of cheese and it mixed together very well. It was probably one of the best I've had. Server was right about it still being good after you reheat in the Microwave. They used thin curly noodles and topped off with some bread crumbs!! YUMMY!!! =)

3) Bacon Blue cheeseburger - Burger was good and the portion was big enough that you almost need fork and knife. I'm not a big blue cheese burger fan however my husband enjoyed it. He was only able to finish half. 

Great place to hang out with friends and watch the game!

Remember to check in to get $5 off... =)"}
{"text":"Slowest place ever. waited over an hour for appetizers. My buddy went to loco patron next door and got tacos before the apps came out. He showed up about 30 mins after we got here too. First app that showed up was an app we put it after the complete order was place. Their excuse was that its a very easy app to make. He then went and got another set of tacos before the entrees came out. Finished eating the second set of tacos and \"fast app\" still isn't out. Entrees came out at room temp not even hot as if it was fresh off the grill ect. Very very very disappointed if I could give no stars I would give no stars. Still sitting here waiting for the app to come out that's suppose to be a \"fast app\" ridiculous!!!!!"}
{"text":"I would not go out of my way to eat burgers here. There are so many great choices in Scottsdale, especially for a great burger. Try Hamburger Rehab, Flemings or Z Tejas."}
{"text":"Poor service. Yikes. It's just a cheeseburger joint. Yawn. Waited over an hour for food... To go... On a Wednesday... Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Really great burgers! My wife and I eat here all the time and have never been disappointed. It can get pretty loud inside the restuarant on a Friday or Saturday night, but there is outside seating and the burgers are definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This is a perfect football bar, we're visiting from Seattle and feel perfectly at home. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"No options for egg free hamburger bun!  Was told by the manager that all of the buns contain egg, so my son was unable to order a burger.  We opted to not eat here as a family, since they were unable to accommodate him.  Sad that restaurants are not willing to take allergens into consideration when creating the menu and offer options."}
{"text":"The chicken strips were pitiful! $8 for 4 tiny kid size strips! You are better off ordering off of the kids menu... Same amount of strips + fries for only $6. Their drinks were awesome, great burgers, lousy hummus! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best sports bar in Old Town.. Especially if your a Chicago sports fan! It feels like I'm back in my hometown grabbing a beer with the boys when I'm here. People actually come to watch the games and drink.. Anddd the foods awesome."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection, nice patio, but sloooow service. Been here a couple times and the experience was the same. Venture a little further south and try Rehab Burger Therapy. Much better."}
{"text":"Let's start with the fact they have great food and we had an incredible server today. Like any restaurant we had a few mishaps, but our server saved the day! I think her name Christina or Christine, regardless she kept her cool, knew the menu, fixed errors, and went above and beyond to accommodate my date and I. 
If I were the proprietor of the establishment, not only would I promote this server, but also ask her to be the new employee trainer. 
Like I said everything wasn't perfect but this girl did everything she could to make great. Hats off to you! Thank you I look forward to my next trip there.
Get the mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and mac n cheese! Also excellent service."}
{"text":"We really enjoy coming here for Thursday night trivia. All of our servers have been great, and good service is normally pretty quick. If you are looking for trivia night this is your place! My only complaint is that sometimes it's tough getting your bill after trivia, as everyone else is asking too. Make sure you ask for your bill just before trivia ends!"}
{"text":"This place has great burgers and they offer gluten free buns! It's also a fun place to watch sports games."}
{"text":"The Hot Dogs are amazing! If you are looking for something outside the norm got to try a Dog! My favorite is the chili and mac dog with the side of chips. Their chips are bomb as well. Everyone I take there just raves over them and cant not eat all of them even if they are full. 

Final Four night was a bit packed but service was still on par that night. Always had drinks in hand and table cleaned. Hostess was swamped but did a great job in managing it all and getting the tables filled and did it was a great personality."}
{"text":"We really liked this place. It is good for BEER and CHEESEBURGERS. The burgers are good, ALMOST as good as REHAB. It is much more sportsy-lively and loud. SF fan crowds can make it hard to get a good seat. We got the Philly and and custom. The fries are good, slaw was eh. But the burgers and beer were both good, hence the stars. Lots of beers on tap, LOTS. Waitress was cute and peppy but would disappear for extended periods, I will not yet judge them on this becasue it seemed she had a busy table inside. Best thing is the handy CUSTOM ORDERING sheets to get what you want on your burger. They have several types of bread, lots of cheese selections and everything else is there too. Just dont go durng a game, unless you want to yell over the \"WHOOPS\"."}
{"text":"2nd trip was much better.  My gf had asked the waitress in detail what was in the mac and cheese, only to find out it had jalapenos in it, which wasn't mentioned by the waitress.  she more than happily replaced it with something else in a quick and timely manner.  my burger came out as ordered and was pretty good.  I'd still recommend Rehab Burger over this place, but if the line is out the door at RB this is a decent fall back."}
{"text":"Went last night and decided to eat here because my party could not agree on food so the compromise was burgers. We decided to eat outside which got a little chilly but our waitress turned on the heater when we asked.

The food was good. We had 2 cobb salads, sliders, veggie burger, rocky point and some other speciality burger. The veggie burger was very good, I believe the patty was vegan but overall 3/5. The cobb salad 5/5, the vegetarian in our group almost ate a piece of chicken because it looked so darn good. Rocky point 4/5. 

Service was not the greatest. Staff seemed like they had an \"attitude\". Atmosphere was good. It was more sport barish. 

Overall the food was all good, service meh and atmosphere good."}
{"text":"Great food. Happy Hour was awesome. Went to use our 10% Yelp check in offer and the server only lets you use it if you write a review so beware."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Absolutely love it here. Perfect place to watch any sporting event. Weekend mornings they have mimosas and build your own bloody Mary's that are killer. And don't get me started on the buffalo chicken dip! It is AMAZING! It is loaded with tasty shredded chicken and comes with homemade potato chips. My mouth is watering as I am writing this! Gotta get back to Scottsdale ASAP!"}
{"text":"the cook on the burgers is soo off, service is slow. It is wayyy too busy for the quality of the food and service. 

Don't think i'd come back"}
{"text":"Burgers were pretty good and the prices were reasonable but I do not recommend the buffalo chicken dip. It was very spicy and had way way to much vinegar. Didn't even eat half."}
{"text":"The only reason I go here is for their Mac and cheese cause it's pretty damn good. However their service SUCKS. And I huge on service. That is what sets you apart as a business! I walk in and I'm standing at the host stand and the girls are just flirting with some guy at the bar. Then, after they finished their conversation is when they acknowledge me. This has happened multiple times too (not the flirting with the bartender situation but them just ignoring you when they finish a text or  finish a convo with a coworker) C'mon peeps."}
{"text":"This was the first spot is where our lunch crew was born. The burgers were good, but you can get better burgers for your buck in the valley. The stars are for their Tot Chos, which is nachos but with tots. Comes in oringinal tots, or sweet potato tots, with chili guac, sour cream... Both are worth it. If we go back, it'll be for tots."}
{"text":"Unfortunately burger was way over seasoned. Salty as gonads on a hot Phoenix summer! If you go here skip the food and stick to brews. Side note the server who was decent didn't give me my Yelp check in discount, so what's the point of offering it?"}
{"text":"Great place and location. Especially with the cooler weather we are getting in Arizona. I have been here for the past 3 weeks since I live with a bunch of patriots fans and this place is the spot to be at for Sunday funday!!! They have great mimosa and build your own bloody deals on Sunday's and their food is also great! I've had almost everything on the menu and I'm never disappointed. Burgers, wings, sliders, build your own mac and cheese, their chicken tenders are always great too. Definitely recommend this place for anyone that's a football fan/and sports fan! And they always have great service, have never been disappointed coming here!"}
{"text":"On the rare occasion I get talked into watching football, Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers is my go to spot. Service is always great, they have amazing wings, quite possibly the strongest mimosa in town, and I mean you can get a gigantic bowl of tater tots... what's not to love about that?!
I will be honest, I don't usually defer from the above food choices, but I have had friends order a burger or a hot dog and they say it's pretty good... They have a ton of TV's with nearly every game on and they get bonus points for actually having the game on and not having background music playing. 

If you need to mix up your weekend game, Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Great service and fun atmosphere! I will totally go back and check out this place again. The burgers are huge and they always keep the beers flowing. My daughter loved her hot dog too!"}
{"text":"Have never eaten here before but was in the area looking for lunch. Place was busy as it is Spring Training time in AZ but we got lucky and grabbed a couple of seats at the bar. Tried 2 of their \"FAV\" burgers, the Rocky Point and the Blue Cheese burger (not the official name but I can't remember it). Both were amazing. The burger itself was great before even getting into toppings or the brioche bun. I will definitely be back. Oh yeah and the beer was cold too."}
{"text":"My favorite spot to go watch football. Everything here rocks. Atmosphere, service, pretty much the whole menu. 

MUST order:
-Any of the mac n cheeses, but chili mac is the best
-Totchos (original) w/ added jalapenos
-Onion dip

{"text":"Grayhawk location review.  Please keep in mind we're talking about a beer and cheeseburger place, not a fine dining restaurant.  It does rate the 4 stars for what it aims to be.  My friend had a Cobb salad and she is the \"connoisseur of Cobbs\". Husband had chicken sandwich which he pronounced very good.  I had veggie burger and it was so good I inquired from where they purchased them.  The GM (Luis) actually came out and sat with us and told us that they are made in house and also was forthcoming in telling us about the restaurant. Service is casual but IT'S A BEER AND HAMBURGER PLACE!  If you want someone to fold your napkin & replace it when you get up to go the bathroom, you're in the wrong place.
It has the feel of a neighborhood gathering place and is family friendly but not overrun with unruly children. Patio on a side of Grayhawk without a lot of traffic and bar opens to the outside on one side. Food is good & prices comparable to other establishments in this category. Please, try it as I would like to see them stay here. You can look at menu on line, there's a little something for everyone."}
{"text":"Let's just start off with the worst customer service ever. The management is horrible, (justin) in particular looked for the any excuse not to put a game on the multiple tv's they had. Needless to say our tab was over $300 and experience was horrible. I will never be coming back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Great food! We went on a Wednesday for the unlimited toppings on the build your own burger and it was great!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, food, and staff.  They serve some great local brews.  No surprise that their 1/2 lb burgers are full of flavor and cooked perfectly.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a taste for a burger, but now I recall why we have not returned here for a while. Food is good, but service not so good. It took at least 5 minutes before someone greeted us at the hostess station. Not even a \"hello, someone will be right worth you. \" Food took a long time and server did not check in either after order was placed or after food was served. Do not plan on going back."}
{"text":"Yes, I had a salad and a Coors light at a place famous for burgers and a large assortment of cold beer.  My husband had a burger and a Mai tai.  The food.....very good. I tried my husbands burger and it was as he said...too good.  And so were the fries.  We have been trying to eat better by stopping when we are full, but this burger made it hard to do so I helped him by eating the rest.  Hey, he's my husband, I threw myself on the burger for him.  The one problem I had was my beer was not cold.  It was 109 that day and I expected a very cold beer.  Maybe it was because it WAS 109 out.  It was also very loud but there was every football game being played on one tv or another so it was loud FUN and not music.  I can live with it.  It was that kind of place.  I will go back when I'm out that way.  Oh...and the CB AND CB salad is yummy too."}
{"text":"Standard burger bar. Decent beer and cocktail selection. Large televisons covering about every wall with several different games playing.  Pretty busy and noisy (which was odd compared with just about every other restaurant around being mostly empty).

I ordered the Ring of Fire burger - it was tasty but fell way short of being spicy enough to be called \"Ring of Fire\".

Overall a decent place to grab a burger and watch the game with friends."}
{"text":"I hauled my a&* up to North Scottsdale (which I loathe to do ) in order to eat here. I'm so happy that they finally landed in Old Town.  Delicious burgers and a quality beer list.  I'm a beer snob and actually do know my beers.  They have a decent selection of high volume beers and I was delighted to see some of my favs on their list.  

The patio is huge and there are tons of tvs.  I have a feeling this is going to be a great spot to watch sports.

Now, it's not cheap.  You do pay a bit for a burger.  However, the burgers are enormous.  I couldn't finish my truffle burger so perhaps splitting one between two would help you feel like less of a pig and allow more cash for beers!"}
{"text":"Service was below average (slow). I had the CB&CB which was very good as well as the standard Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Great service and food is very good. Tons of TVs, watching NCAA game prior to the Cubs vs Giants game at Scottsdale Stadium."}
{"text":"My kinda spot.....TVs blasted everywhere. Burger was amazing....\"juicy Lucy\". Buddy had the pbj burger .....and he loved it"}
{"text":"Great sports bar ! Plenty of TVs and there's really no bad seat in the house. They seem to have a bit of an identity crisis, one day it's a Buckeye bar, the next a Nebraska bar, the next a Bronco bar, the next a Patriot bar.. but I guess there's really nothing wrong with that. The food is pretty good and if you can find a beer you like, then you're too much of a beer snob and should move to Panama. 
Take money, tho. Lots and lots of money. That's my only advice!"}
{"text":"Olivia took care of our party of 8 with ease! She was very efficient and quick to satisfy. Very friendly and beautiful too! Our food was all good and we had a good time. We didn't have to wait long either. Nice atmosphere and the music wasn't overly loud. Interesting decorations and comfortable seating. As long as Olivia is working here we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to sit outside for food and drinks with the family.  It's a bit loud, but that didn't bother me.  My son had a bacon cheeseburger; you can build your own burger.  My father had a Thousand Island burger, my mother had a Juicy Lucy & I had a PB & J bacon burger.  The chips were delicious and my son seemed to enjoy his fries.  There were lots of yummy sounding appetizers, sandwiches, hot dogs and desserts.  There was a pretty extensive drink menu, too.  I had a tropical buzz and a skull crusher.; my mother had a margarita and my father had beer.  The restaurant was very clean and wait staff was great.  Note:  they don't have Happy Hour during Spring Training."}
{"text":"Back again Lauren F was my server not only was it love at first sight but she was a great server . I absolutely love this place I had the turkey burger today is off the hook if you want a cheeseburger or a cold beer you need to come check it out"}
{"text":"Spacious, great menu, and stellar tater tots. What more could you ask for? The kitchen was still open at 10pm on a Sunday (reverse Happy Hour, no less!) This could be love..."}
{"text":"The is one of my go to places. Great food - burgers, hot dogs, mozzarella sticks etc. Great for sports watching and always accommodating for fight night and UFC!"}
{"text":"A great birthday celebration and world class attention from Mark. Can't wait for Arcadia location to open!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 10 times and each time it's been a bit underwhelming. Great for sports and cold beers. Today was likely my last visit....I ordered a turkey burger that was not prepared properly....explained it to the waitress..who seemed uninterested. Not only did she not offer to have the order corrected but charged me for the burger that I literally took 3 bites of. I typically bring family from out of town or clients...but will likely find another spot."}
{"text":"I don't drink beer or eat beef/pork, but despite the name, I gave this place a try and was pleasantly surprised.  Wine (check), chicken, turkey, or fish (check)...then I'm good to go!

The wings wings wings were a pretty basic no frills type but super super super tasty!!!  I ordered the buffalo wings well done and they came with a dry rub that gave the wings a nice flavor.

This place is always busy, which is a good sign for a lot of reasons.  

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great spot for college football.  We were in town from the West Coast and happy to find a bar that opened at 9am on a Saturday.  Bartender was friendly and attentive, happy to adjust the channel on a TV so we could sit outside abd watch the game.  We actually didn't eat but the food looked delicious and they have an extensive bar food menu.  Awesome beer selection as well, both draft and bottle/can"}
{"text":"I didn't love it the burger was so so the bread tasted stale. The service was bad real bad she seemed annoyed when I asked a question about 1 of the beers.  I think maybe she didn't want to work or was having a shitty day.  Go to rehab burger down the street wayyyyyy better.  Gave it two stars(generously) because good atmosphere game volume was on. The hostess didn't even say bye when we left she was just texting not even looking up.  Good luck surviving in Old Town CB & CB. Teach your staff MANAGER!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Wednesday pimp your burger and it certainly did not disappoint! Best deal in America right here. Any topping you want for a flat $11! Definitely will be coming here next time I'm in Scottsdale on a Wednesday for sure. Especially during spring training this is certainly the place be. Nothing but great things to say about it! Oh yeah, and best onion rings I've had to date."}
{"text":"Love hamburgers? This is the place.
As someone who absolutely loves a good cheeseburger and has ordered them in countless establishments around the country where the burgers are acclaimed, the burgers here are as good as I've ever had. Indeed, I'm not sure I've had better--maybe a tie with Hops Burger Bar in Greensboro, NC. 
Big, juicy, high quality, and lots of choices for buns and condiments and extras. Also, the fries are to die for. And more also [Is that an acceptable phrase?], great selection of beers.
Finally, terrific service--very friendly, accommodating, and quick--and fun atmosphere.
Totally recommend this place (unless you prefer something stuffy or quiet), especially if you're on a quest for a GREAT burger."}
{"text":"Love the food here, the buffalo chicken egg rolls are soo good! Not super big on sports bars but my boyfriend loves it and the service is always fantastic."}
{"text":"This place has great burgers and good beer! If you are trying to catch up with friends it is a bit loud to have a conversation. Great place to watch sports games!"}
{"text":"Bartenders do a great job to make sure you're happy, and the beer selection is great. Feel free to try a few. Highly recommend asking what's new, as the list seems to rotate and the bartenders know it well"}
{"text":"Pretty lackluster. For a place that has \"cheeseburgers\" in their name you would expect the food to be pretty amazing. There was a group of 4, we all had a different burger and none of them were out of this world by any means. The service was pretty awful too. Yeah, they were busy, but that doesn't mean we should be ignored. Definitely will not be giving them another shot."}
{"text":"I stopped in at this location shortly after I moved back to AZ about 2 yrs ago for HH (which is around the time it opened I think) and liked it. Honestly, I can't remember anything particular that made it really stand out, but it was solid nonetheless.

I stopped back in again recently, and really liked it! Maybe I'm exaggerating but it seemed like the menu had expanded & they had more to offer during HH. I also came on a Wednesday, which is when this place offers unlimited toppings on burgers for $11. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to drink during this visit but it did look like they had a large beer selection.

My friend & I started with a pretzel. It was soft & chewy & I LOVED the cheese sauce that came with it (it was peppery so it had a little kick to it). As far as my burger went, it was good but honestly nothing super great (I think it was the bun...it was a bit stale). The beef tasted fresh though (as well as the toppings) and was cooked the way I ordered. 

Our server was good & knew the menu. I liked the atmosphere as well. It's basically an Old Town version of a sports bar (and I mean that as a good thing).

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great beer, good food. But oh boy, that water. DO NOT ASK FOR WATER, JUST DRINK BEER. If you do, be prepared. A brown mushy tsunami will be your closest companion in your VERY frequent stops to the restroom. Of course if you are into that, go for it. 

Just drink the beer."}
{"text":"Decent hh drink specials and decent food. Good atmosphere to watch sports."}
{"text":"I just dont understand the hype here. 1st time I came here was for a football game and it was dead, which doesnt bother me, but the fact that I couldnt get any service when they weren't busy does bother me. Had the totchos and I couldn't finish them, they just weren't good. A couple months later I came back with my buddies and once again, bad service and medicore food, at best. They do have a pretty good TV set up though if you are going for sports, so maybe just stick with the drinks, sit at the bar, and stay away from the food. Personally, I think there are a lot better options in the area for Sports Bars."}
{"text":"I could not have had a better experience here, it was exactly what I was looking for! I stopped in with my boyfriend and a friend on a Friday afternoon around happy hour time and we were looking to have a good dinner in a fun environment before heading into the old town bars for the night.

We were able to grab seats at the bar even though the restaurant was almost full. We were served by a couple of really friendly and helpful bartenders. They explained the happy hour specials and helped us pick out some good beers.

What a great beer selection, and I loved the mugs they served the beer in. It was just fun to drink out of.

The whole place was boisterous and had a really fun and happy vibe. We ordered an appetizer which I think was chips with some kind of cheese and nacho type topping. Whatever it was it was delicious! 

I ordered the veggie burger as my meal and I'm SO glad I did! Holy cow their veggie burger is incredible. The bartender told me she recommends it to people regardless of whether or not they are vegetarians because it's so good.

On the menu, it says that if you like the food you can add a beer to your tab for the kitchen staff when they are done with their shift. What a great idea! I bet they're drunk every night because the food was incredible. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Burgers beers and sports! Whats not to like!  We stop here for lunch on weekend bike rides from Phoenix and have really enjoyed it. The assortment of beer selections is almost as broad as the burger combinations LOL. Everything is very very good especially the truffle fries! The place gets very crowded on game days so get there early if you plan to watch a particular game. Enjoy! We do!"}
{"text":"this locations customer service needs help. 
The receptionist don't listen, and are to busy flirting with men customers. I was very offended when I came to the podium and told the girl I was picking up my order, she looked me up and down and asked is this for door dash or postmate...I was so offended, did she ask any of the other guests who were picking up if they were delivery services , NO. I was told a 15-20 minute wait for my food, it's been over 30minutes and I am still waiting. I wouldn't be surprised if my order was wrong also 

I won't be coming back to this location again. My sweet tots were burnt"}
{"text":"As the name implies this place specializes in cold beer and cheeseburgers.  The happy hour specials feature local AZ brews and apps for $5 and less.  I love the selection of draft beers and the burgers.  The pittsburgher was great as well as the bbq cheddar burger.  I also had the spicy home made chips which were great to munch on while deciding what to order.  I found their prices to be reasonable especially for old town Scottsdale.  Next time I am in AZ I will have dinner there.  The service has been decent (although not mind blowing) and I prefer sitting outside on the patio to the inside of the restaurant."}
{"text":"What a great place to catch some football games (there are tons of tvs playing every game) and hang out. We stopped by on a saturday and sat at the bar. Everyone was friendly and prompt. I loved the huge $12 mimosa with $1 refills. Yes, please!

Food was good, there was a lot of mayo on my sandwich but that's a pretty minor complaints. It was noisy/livey so definitely not a quiet spot. We sat inside but they had a nice looking outdoor patio area."}
{"text":"What can I say, this is a spectacular sports bar offering absolutely top quality fair with a massive draft and bottle beer selection.
I always have a pleasant experience, though it is busy almost always as a result of there quality offering.
Located in the heart of the very chic, showy and always fun \" Old Town Scottsdale\"."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Order took forever but they apologized and gave us desert!  Thanks Mike the manager for making everything right."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I really did. 

I went here on a Thursday night with the boyfriend. It was busy, but not busy enough to warrant us being forgotten about for 25 minutes after being seated. Now, you'd think that after a server forgot about a table, they'd do their best to be on top of service: not the case. We saw our waitress one more time to ask how our food was, but she was gone before we could answer. We had to grab another waitress to get our check because after an hour and a half of being here, we wanted to go home. We had finished our food long ago. A different waitress happy got our check and apologized for the bad service. That's why this place got any stars for my vote. 

If only the food was good. Nope. Boyfriend's cheeseburger was chewy and unseasoned. Mine would have been okay if it had been seasoned at all and the patty hadn't been burned. Boyfriend said his was burned as well. 

It was too loud to hear yourself, let alone your attending party. Disadvantage. 

Honestly, this made me sad. I'm hopeful that it was the high bustle of the night that made our experience so terrible. I'm hesitant to give it another try. Sad."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Came here for lunch and got the buffalo chicken tots as an appetizer which were amazing! And of course the burgers are on point! You can taste the fire in the patty!!!! 

Wednesday's are BYOB (build your own burger) with unlimited toppings for $11."}
{"text":"This place delivers exactly what they promise - cold beer and cheeseburgers! 
My favorite thing there was the tater tot nachos - SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty fun! The staff can get a little forgetful and zone out a little, but they are pretty upbeat. Why not 4 stars, it's a bit pricey for a burger/bar joint. I unfortunately didn't order a burger, I just ordered mozzarella sticks to munch on, while my friend ordered a full meal. The mozzarella sticks were pretty decent, I usually say motsy sticks can be determined by the marinara sauce, if you have good marinara you have good motzy sticks. Their sauce was pretty decent for a burger place, not bad at all! I have to say I wish I did get a burger, for my friend ordered their BBQ/Bacon burger and it was pretty delicious! Im not a fan of BBQ, but this burger wasn't overpowered with the BBQ sauce. The BBQ taste was a good flavor that added to the burger, bacon and cheese! Gave it a nice little kick! Food was good, staff was decent, stays pretty busy on the weekends and the prices are a little high, but you have to kind of expect that for they are right there in Old Town Scottsdale. Old Town seems to have little higher prices then other restaurants down the streets. Overall A-OK place!"}
{"text":"Good place to watch sports, grab a burger and beer.   Appetizer menu looks pretty good as well."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went on a road trip in the US and we stopped here for dinner. I loved to be being able to watch the Monday night, place is really cool. The girls are pretty and the customer service is good and even better here we had the best burger of the whole trip and I am burger addict. We wanted to stay longer but despite outside being nice warm inside this place it was freezing. We come from England and felt like January in Europe. What a shame. Why? This is very stupid, enjoy the warmth and make people feel comfortable. I'd go back with a winter jacket in August but overall we loved the place. There's also gluten free option and good selection of beers."}
{"text":"So disappointed with our recent visit.  
Although we were seated immediately, we ended up waiting over 30 minutes for our first beer.  In that time, our server showed up at our table on three different occaisions.  
The first (10 minutes after being seated) to deliver two waters without saying a word.  
The second (10 minutes after the first stop) to say she was sorry for taking so long and would be right back.
The 3rd (10 minutes later) to apologize again and complain that she had 2- ten tops in a row that had slammed her.  Although I can appreciate her being busy this was really not my concern.
We ordered and within 5 minutes we had our appetizer and within another 3-5 minutes we had our food.  
Our beers showed up about the same time as our food.
So yes, terrible experience from a restaurant we have been to dozens of times.  (Mostly Grayhawk).

But, wait for it, the worst part about the entire experience was the manager who, in a fleeting attempt to ask how we were doing, was both annoyed and skeptical when I told him about our experience.  Then, in the most condescending way possible looks at me and says \"30 minutes?, Really?  That is hard to believe.\"  I asked for nothing in return and only that I was bringing it to his attention only as he had asked.  He then offered to buy me a beer, that's right one beer for the five of us.  Proof of his condescension.

Too busy to manage your table, then give it up to one of the other servers that were not as challenged.
Manager failed to deliver to his employee and his customer and his owner.

Will be a very long time before we are back if ever."}
{"text":"Don't have Lauren as your server. She has an attitude and doesn't give your change back! She ruin my experience at this place. The food was great but the server was awful and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice, the inside, patio and bar area was fun but the prices were very high and the food was mediocre at best... they had a large beer selection but you can almost go anywhere for that."}
{"text":"Second time here. It's a go to for sports events for us when we are in the area. We had great service and felt the attention of management to get the TV's set to what customers wanted as tables change was really awesome. I got the build your own Mac and cheese, and they were very accommodating with my husbands keto friendly requests. All the food was satisfying as we expected. The build your own options are really cool! They have a burger too. Our server was Olivia and she really made our visit."}
{"text":"Total fail! Second time here for Mac daddy night. Both times messed up order. This time also: cracked beer glass and the table next to us got a burger with \"sour cheese\". Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice: NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I like the ambiance of this place; feels like a sports bar. Lots of big TVs, inside and out.  Loud, but not so loud you can't carry on a normal volume conversation with your group. We sat on the patio, it was nice! Great spot for people watching! 

The food was good; we split the chicken tenders and mozzarella sticks. Pretty large portions for being labeled as appetizers. Saw a few burgers coming out - they looked delicious! So big! Wednesdays are like BYOB (build your own burger) night for $10!! Whatever toppings you want! That is such a deal!! I think it said Monday is like build your own mac and cheese night.

The beer list was pretty good too, lots of options, and pricing seemed about average! 

The service was okay; she was definitely more interested in the tables of guys that were drinking. 

Would most likely stop by again next time I am in town to try out a burger!"}
{"text":"Great casual and fun place for burgers and beers. Food is good and beers are cold, just like the name says. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the price. The burgers are good, but a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a week ago.  Got sat right away on a busy Saturday night even though they were pretty packed.  We ordered drinks and the waitress looks at my ID and says \"wow you are old.  I mean that in a good way because you don't look that old.\"  Hmmm...  really?  Anyway, the food was really good, the drinks were good, and we enjoyed our meal.  So all in all it was a good experience."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite spot for burgers in Old Town.  The staff is always friendly. I've never had a bad experience here. It's consistently good."}
{"text":"Fantastic casual burger joint in old town Scottsdale.  I love to come to places like this and relax to avoid all of the heuty-teuty snobbery going on elsewhere in the area.  Burgers are well prepared and delicious.  I recommend the blue cheese and bacon burger, with a cold beer of course."}
{"text":"The beer was indeed cold.  The cheeseburger was delicious. The staff was attentive and friendly. Our server, Cole, brought our food out piping hot, made certain we had everything we needed.
No dearth of sports on the flat panels that were everywhere.
Even the canned music, a bit loud for us, was pleasing (not head-banger).
Nothing not to like really!"}
{"text":"Awesome location and people watching at this location with open front.  I didn't get to people watch as they seated us at the worst table in the place (1st bench seat on the Left coming in).  I had the prime dip which was good but usually have the Grayhawk Club.  Stay away from the tot appetizer if your on a diet as it's to die for. Great TV's and waitresses which keep people coming back."}
{"text":"I must say that when I saw that this was the official meeting place for the Chicago Bears fan club, I was sold already. Go Bears!!

This place was pretty good. A nice selection of beers and a good variety of bar foods ranging from hot dogs to beef noodles. I had the coney island dog with Four Peaks Sunbru. Both were excellent choices.

As far as atmosphere, you will love this place. Several big screens all over, live bar area, outdoor patio, and full stocked bar. This place is a must-go to on game day. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Reviewed a year ago previously. Used to be our favorite place to watch college & NFL football and baseball. They still have good food and bartenders but the manager who manages and controls the tv's on Saturday is a rude and ignorant individual who has some of the worst customer service skills I've ever encountered in The entire Valley. He is consistently a miserable obese person to everyone he speaks to .....may it be customers and the employees working for him. Someone with CBCB needs to sit him down and tell him to get off his high horse and explain to him that he's just a bar manager and that he needs an attitude adjustment.
 I am Project Manager and have worked for some of biggest Industrial General contractors and have never spoken to anyone beneath me or above me with tone and attitude that person has had with myself and other patrons just having simple requests to just put a game on the tv in their general vicinity. He doesn't hesitate to respond with a rude comment or facial smirk when he is approached. 
I'm sure we are not the only ones that feel this way because on numerous occasions I've heard comments about his bad attitude from other patrons. His attitude this past week was more than we want deal anymore and are going to watch Saturday and Sunday football at another establishment along with our friends and family."}
{"text":"Great beer selection however chicken breast sandwiches are anemic. Very very thin chicken breast and lots of bun !"}
{"text":"Just like it's other location. THey have cold beer. They have cheeseburgers (incredibly juicy cheeseburgers) I was not a huge fan of this location, but it had more to do with the crowd then the restaurant. Just a lot of bro-men and older couples trying to recapture their youth. Burgers are jusicy, as mentioned, but lack flavor. I'll still rather go with in and out."}
{"text":"This is supposedly an Auburn bar but they refused to play the auburn game on 1 TV today. Total Bs, even bough we had someone show up at 10 am for a 2pm game to get a table. We had 14 people with us. So sad and completely disappointed in the way management handled it! Pretty sure we will not be back"}
{"text":"By far the worse service I have ever had!! Server was Grace and she did absolutely nothing for us, we pretty much served ourselves, got up asking for our own things, order was not correct, never had food quality check! This place has good burgers but GRACE really didn't help us at all!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Ordered a build your own burger that exceeded my expectations. And their ranch dressing is sooooo good."}
{"text":"I had the Asian chicken salad and it was not good at all; the food took forever and the tap water was nasty. Don't drink it! 

I'd recommend not ordering any salads or the grilled cheese. Maybe just have some beer here! (With cheeseburgers, I guess)"}
{"text":"This is a fun place! It's one of those bars/restaurants that appeals to both guys and gals in that it's casual but still a bit trendy and interesting not to mention the selection of burgers and beers to choose from (not that you couldn't have guessed that from the name). 

They have a great selection of local brews (which I love). Pretty much any major AZ brewery is represented- Sonoran, 4 Peaks, Phoenix Brewing, Papago, San Tan the list goes on and on. This place is usually packed on the weekends and during major sporting events so plan ahead if you have your heart-set on coming then. 

Overall, this is a good place to take distant relatives that your mom made you hang out with because \"He's new to AZ and is going to ASU and needs a friend...blah blah blah\" because it's loud enough that if there's awkward silence it won't matter. Plus, there's a burger for every palate so it's a safe bet."}
{"text":"True to it's name, this place is all about great sports viewing, comfort food (tot-chos?  awesome) and a broad beer/booze selection.  Servers are friendly and accommodating, manager roams around making sure you're pleased, and the location and seating configuration is perfect for hot, sunny days.  They also operate Arcadia Tavern, which is a similar experience.  I'll hit this place any time I want to catch a game and some good bar food."}
{"text":"POOR SERVICE.  The food was great, fantastic burgers and fries.  Sadly the service was terrible.  I had to go get my own silverware and napkins and when they brought the food out they did not know which plate was what and we had to short out whose was whose.  After this the food was great which is the only reason they get 3 stars."}
{"text":"Long story short... everything here is pretty inconsistent in their quality, except their burgers. Get a burger to be on the safe side."}
{"text":"I am surprised at the medium score. 

Came here to get out of the rain and hear great music. Along with that came a perfectly grilled cheese and tomato sandwich with loads of gooey cheese. They put two kinds of cheese and two tomato slices. Excellent.  

Person with me had a make your own cheeseburger and asked for cheese only. A brave choice because you only have the quality of the beef speaking. It came exactly as ordered, toasty roll, cheese and perfectly grilled burger, medium rare. 

All of the orders come with the  BEST made fries. I usually leave them if they come included however not here. Perfect fries.

You can't do better than going to a restaurant and each item brought to the table is just perfect!

Go in and enjoy the music and order up some great food for yourself. You know, I think some folks drink here also...just saying.

I'm done, please turn up the music!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to watch sports games going on. It is loud but fun loud with everyone cheering with the teams. We came to watch one of the final four games and had a great time. I had the burger with jalape√±os and other spicy toppings and it was really good. One of the best burgers I have had in a long time. There is a yelp check in offer as well for 10% off. Really liked the chips and we tried the fries as well which were great. One person at our table got the grilled cheese and that was not worth the price, it was really just basic and nothing great but the burgers were all fantastic so stick with what they are known for! The server we were talking to later after we ate said their version of nachos on the potato chips are amazing so we will have to try that next time we are in. They have a regular and spicy version she said. Great selection of drinks and burgers and very fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good food, good views, and good brews. Can definitely get one of the best burgers in town here!"}
{"text":"Amazing drinks, service, atmosphere,  very friendly staff way better then Bandera! Come here and enjoy!"}
{"text":"My wife and I took my parents for dinner to CBCB on a Sunday evening. We were seated on the patio.  As usual, the beer was excellent, everyone enjoyed their food, at less I think they did, but we could not engage in conversation.

The television speakers were so loud we could not hear one another speak at the table. We asked the wait staff if the sound could be turned down to which they replied \"sure\", but then ignored the request.

Many restaurants are loud simply because of the number of people dining and the atmosphere.  This dinner was annoying - I hate competing with the TV/stereo noise when trying to dine with friends and family."}
{"text":"Well, it wasn't bad, but I wasn't impressed either. I went there during the week and it was packed. I thought, this seems promising because there are almost no open seats on a Tuesday afternoon. 

Upon sitting down, we had prompt service and our waitress was nice. We tried the buddha's delight mac and cheese, which was really bland and boring. I ordered the steakhouse truffle burger, which was in one word, GREASY! Each bite I took seemed to get greasier. I really couldn't taste anything else. My friend had the bacon and bleu. He thought it was pretty good, but was surprised that he could barely taste the bleu cheese, since it tends to be a strong flavor. 
 
I would give it another try because I have friends who recommended it, but if it tastes just as bland next time, I won't be back again."}
{"text":"One of the best cheese burgers I have ever had! No doubt about it! But I would hope a place names after the thing would now how to do it right. 

The food quality was great, and their options were nice. Pretty much anything you want you can have on your burger. They also are the only place in town that carries they type of non-alcoholic beer my husband likes, big points for this one!

My husband and I don't make it out to Scottsdale that often so we thought we would venture that way for an ASN game and come greasy food. I only have a couple of complaints, they quoted us a wait time much much loner than it actually was. Our server was great, but the timing on the food took a little while. Also, they had the ASU game on but they formatted it wrong and it cut off a lot of the screen. We mentioned this to the server a few times, but now one cared to fix it. Weird. 

But we enjoyed our burgers and went home for the rest of the game. 
Definitely worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Big day of football today! I spoke with manager eye to eye at 10am and he said he could not reserve tables for Auburn or play the sound but would have the game on a couple of Tv's! We show up early to get a table and when game starts he refuses to put the game on one TV! Really you fly our flag and suppose to be home to Auburn but will not play the game on one TV? WAR EAGLE

I have loved coming to watch Auburn almost every week here! Very disappointed you could not play the game for us! Especially after I made a point to stop by that morning to verify you were going to have the game on!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a cool little hang out. With many TV's and tons of beer on tap. The services is alright and the drinks are pretty good. I had a great ruby read cocktail that was delicious. 

Appetizer: BUFFALO CHICKEN DIP - we started with the buffalo chicken dip which was AMAZING. I've had this before at a pot roast, but never at a restaurant. It is a great appetizer to share and very yummy! Of course I got it without bleu cheese. 

Burger: While many of the burgers looked appetizing, I had the Steakhouse Truffle as recommended by the waiter. While the smell was a little funny from the truffle it was GREAT! 

I would definitely go back for a laid back dinner at the bar."}
{"text":"Classic looking sports bar with ok outdoor seating. TVs everywhere. The main problem with this place is the price. The food is not bad at a lower price point, but to get a couple of drinks and food you are looking at around 20 per person. Not the worst by any means, but the food is just ok and in a town like this there are too many better places."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute favorite of mine for one item on the menu - the Steakhouse Truffle Burger.  It has NEVER disappointed me.  The flavor of the truffle oil and the heirloom tomatoes - it seriously is one of the best burgers I have ever had. The staff is always nice and even during busy times, the food is hot and delivered in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I discovered this place during baseball playoffs. Great atmosphere and place to watch sports games - tons of tv, huge bar. The food is exceptional. The burgers are good but the build-your-own mac n cheese steals the show. It's so good w/ green chili, chicken and blends of cheeses. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and sitting outside. Had the All American burger and the Mac and cheese. Delicious!! If you're in the area I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had lunch today, family of six.  Everyone really enjoyed the food!  Great burgers, great Mac and cheese, and a great salad!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We have gone here multiple times and it's usually pretty good, great burgers. Unfortunately, after last night I will never go back. I have never had service as horrible as we did last night. By the end we were all wondering if it was some kind of joke. I will keep it short because I could probably write a book about everything that went wrong. First our waitress knowingly brought us the wrong drinks and did not even offer to fix it. We all did the build your own burger so she asked us to write our names on our orders so there was no confusion about who ordered what but this proved pointless. After waiting 45mins one burger came out with no name or any knowledge of what was even on the burger. The waitress took it back to the kitchen to find out whose it was 20mins later a different burger came out with no name so that one was taken back to the kitchen also. Finally 40mins after the first burger was taken back, all 4 came out. Not one burger was right or what we ordered and when one said they ordered a pretzel bun the waitress said she would bring the bun so we can reassemble the burger at the table ourselves. We were clearly aggravated with her response and so she proceeded to roll her eyes at us every time she walked by our table and would refuse to check on us after the food was brought out. I finally had to go find a manager and although he was extremely nice and did comp most of our bill it was by far the worse restaurant experience I have ever had. Such a shame too because we go there often."}
{"text":"The burger was very flavorous. We got the mac and cheese burger medium rare and it was cooked perfect. The server Valentina is her name I think? She has black long hair and glasses was awesome! We wanted a half order of the classic tot. Even though they said they don't so that anymore she figure out something that works for us! Will for sure go back again because of her."}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday about 1pm, and it was packed! We were seated at the edge of the patio along the street, which was good. The nearby bar was very loud and I couldn't even hear people talk at the other end of our table; I was glad we weren't seated where it was even louder.

Our server was fine, but the food service was slow--not a surprise considering the crowd. It took over an hour for our meals to finally come out. The drinks, however, came out promptly. I had a Home Run Margarita, which was tasty. The rest of the table shared Parmesan Truffle Fries and liked them well. 

When the food finally came out, I was dismayed to find my Asian Chicken salad (which was $12) was so small. It was tasty, though not filling. My son had the kids meal with macaroni and cheese and fries, and was quite happy with that. My husband enjoyed his customized burger and said the jalapenos had a good kick.

I was left with mixed feelings about the experience. It wasn't terrible by any means, but with so many choices around, I don't think I'd return to this location or try another in the chain."}
{"text":"I visited this place and it was better than I expected. It's burgers and bar food like you might expect. The food was pretty food, loved their tater tots.  

What I particularly liked was the effort they put into making it fun and inviting. I'm not one for trivia but they were having a trivia night and people were really getting into it. 

My friend and I came in late so we just did the trivia amongst ourselves. 

Either way a good place to stop in for a bite.
I'd be interested in seeing what a regular night is like do I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food was good, and the beer was cold, but really nothing too spectacular. The same food and drinks you would find at Buffalo Wild Wings, or a Red Robin. There was nothing wrong with it, but nothing that makes you want to come back over and over again."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Sunday to catch the Saints game with a friend and was not disappointed. The selection of beer was admirable, the appetizers tasty, and the ambience on the porch was festive and fun! I shared my discovery that checking in with the Yelp app on my phone got me $5 off with some of my neighbors (we were sharing a table with total strangers... European style!), and they followed suit and checked in themselves. It was the easiest way I've ever bought anybody a beer.

As for the food, first I sampled my friend's tater tots, which all sorts of good stuff on them... green onions and special sauce. I was happy to note that despite the sauce, they stayed mighty crunchy, which is how they should be. Nothing more disappointing than soggy tots... and I have had my share of those. I had to sample the wings here, which were a little hard to locate on the menu since they are listed as \"grilled drummettes\". I asked for the combination of all three types, so I could try the Classic Buffalo, Golden Mustard and Sweet Citrus Teriyaki styles. I can say that they were respectable wings--meaty and crispy and flavorful. But they tended to seem a little bit on the dry side. I would've preferred they had more sauce on them. I also enjoyed the Parmesan Truffle Fries, but should've gotten a half order... this was a big heapin' bowl of fries. Again, I could've used more grated parmesan and would prefer that the fries were a thinner cut, but they were decent and scarfable nonetheless.

This place was busy on an NFL Sunday, which made it a little bit hectic, but I have nothing bad to say about the service. Our waitress was quick and attentive (albeit somewhat busy with other tables), not to mention friendly and... gorgeous. I noticed that most of the wait staff here was super attractive. It could've been that the atmosphere here was so infectiously happy that it made me more amorous than usual. This is a great location and a fabulous place to catch a game and some good eats with friends."}
{"text":"In-N-Out, Shake Shack, Five Guys, and even the the high-end gourmet Burger places are all great, but CB&C has all of their burgers beat."}
{"text":"In the heart of Old Town right on Scottsdale Road---a pleasant oasis for a really good burger and fries.  Great open patio---pleasant service--what could be bad?"}
{"text":"Best cheeseburger ever!!!   Loved the build your own feature.  High quality ingredients.  We also order the chili Cheese tots which were so good.  The French fries are solid and the onion rings were even better!  My husband ordered the beer flight and liked the sunbru best.  We will definitely be back again.  I want to try their Mac n Cheese next."}
{"text":"Great buffalo chicken dip and pretty good service! Next time I go I'm going to try a chicken sandwich instead of a very greasy burger."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. In town from Chicago visiting friends and family, and after hearing my friends sister raved about this place we decided to try it out. Mind you Chicago has Lockdown and Kumas so I am extremely jaded when it comes to new burger joints but I try to keep my expectations reasonably low. I would also like to preface this with the fact that I work in a restaurant and am not the kind of person that complains about everything on Yelp. First the food: pretty average to good, nothing special really but not terrible and somewhat reasonably priced with good specials. The service: it was the worst dining experience I've had in a long time. Our server, whose name is Jordan (sorry to put you on blast but people need to know before wasting money here), a limp, lifeless slip of a thing who barely deigned to speak to us. She messed up the order, or the kitchen did, and when I brought it up she told me I was wrong and that the two missing burger toppings had just \"evaporated\" in the cooking process. Sorry girl but aioli does not disappear when heated. After realizing that I was going to send it back and be a complete jerk or just eat I ate it and said thanks and its okay. Then we are ignored by her for the rest of the meal and when she brings us the check she charged us $19.50 for what was supposed to be an $11 dollar burger. I'm tired of typing now and this is really long but its what happened and I hope if anyone decides to waste their hard-earned money on this junk they maybe consider Stax instead."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was awesome. Service was great. My burger was just ok. Had the PB & J Burger. I like the one from Rehab Burger Therapy better, but it was ok. Great place to watch sports and good beer prices!"}
{"text":"Just as the name says.  Its the perfect place for a cold beer and a Bar None Cheeseburger.  They are monsters and I almost couldn't finish.  They did a great job cooking it and it was served at the perfect temp.  I came here for Veterans Day for lunch and we were seated right away and our server was attentive without being there every 10 seconds.  It was great and I will be back."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was attentive. Atmosphere was great with good music and trivia night was a lot of fun. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good cheeseburger. Not the best I've had, but not the worst either. Great beer. Cool atmosphere, and glad I got to hangout here with some friends. Waitress was awesome and the 10% off my bill with the yelp checking was great :)
I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"The burgers are tasty but a bit too overpriced. The place is nice and they have trivia which is fun, but the burger isnt Anything special. Ill be real the food isnt any better than and applebees. But it will get the ole ball and chain off your back because thats what this place is geared towards, women. The burgers are based off toppings and the meat is really nothing special. Side dishes are trash and it really needs an upgrade. I recommend many other places if your going for a burger."}
{"text":"To my surprise,  the best restaurant burger I've ever had. We came to watch UFC fights. I didn't expect much in the way of food or service,  but they exceeded my expectations. I liked the simple menu and the pairing of chips instead of the typical french fries. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Service is always friendly and quick.  Good food for what this is since I tend to avoid fattening food places like this. Like that they have some healthy options for me; while hubby can get his high calorie sandwiches and fries (Which he thought were some of the best in town).

Its loud with tons of tv's but thats the way its supposed to be since this is a sports bar/burger place.  We are not into sports so its not so great for us but we will still come back because of the great value, fun location and atmosphere and variety of food options!"}
{"text":"Had burgers and beers here last night with a group of friends. Great burgers. Really like the sweet potato tots :) great beer selection. Wish we would have hit happy hour! And saw the 10% offer after we left!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new so we stopped in here for lunch. It was very busy when we arrived and I didn't think we'd be seated right away but we were seat immediately. The waitress was attentive through the whole meal. Three out of four of us got our meals very quickly but it was pretty obvious that they forgot about last one. Took them about 10-15 minutes after all our other food came out that they brought out the last meal. However they were very sorry about the mistake and handled it very professionally. I had the Buddha Mac and Cheese and it was the best Mac and Cheese I've had in a long time! It was super creamy and flavorful! The only big negative I really had was the music. It was insanely loud inside. There were four of us seated in the booth and I could only clearly hear my husband who was right next to me. So not a great place if you want to have a nice conversation. It did seem a little less noisy on the patio. So we may try sitting outside if we go again."}
{"text":"Good beer. Great service. Everyone is super friendly and happy. I didn't order any food.  Just came in to have a beer while I cool off from this heat.  They're are so many selections of beer to choose from. And the seating is open to the outside but you stay cool with the ac running on full blast. Great atmosphere to sit and  watch the game."}
{"text":"Great burgers great tater tots.  Nice beer selection.  Plenty of TVs to catch the big game.  Friendly service.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place - GREAT food, cold beer, awesome atmosphere, and usually great takeout! I ordered takeout recently though and was a little disappointed with the amount of food I received for an $8 plate...."}
{"text":"I stopped in here simply because the name was hilarious, but I was pleasantly surprised. The waitresses were super quick and able to divide up our big groups check quickly and accurately. Beer selection was good and food came out fast/ great. It's a solid place to start a night out in old town."}
{"text":"Love Moses! We had reservations somewhere else and were treated badly so came here.  Moses was amazing!"}
{"text":"Over all good food and good atmosphere. Some of the speciality burgers are more of a gimmick than a culinary accomplishment, but they have  something for everyone."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Great selections on the menu. They have a build your own mac n cheese. I didn't get it but it sounded delicious. I will definitely be back to try it. Patio seating is nice. The service was great."}
{"text":"If I could give half a star I would. I have been at this location a few other times on a Saturday, and my understanding is that they primarily are designated as an Auburn bar.  This past Saturday they chose to show the ASU vs U of A game, which I can understand but then the rest of the TVs were on Ohio State. My friend had specifically asked earlier in the day if they were going to show the Auburn game and she was told yes. However, when the group at our table asked them to turn the game on just one tv the management refused. He was extremely rude and confrontational with my friend.  He should be fired for how he treats frequent patrons.  And I urge all other Auburn fans to boycott this bar."}
{"text":"The b Burger was really tasty for hummus was amazing homemade everything was fresh the service byErin nd the waitress was absolutely one of the best I've had over all this was just a great spot for lunch definitely recommend.   I agree with others it is a bit loud.  Wednesday's are build your burger at a discount."}
{"text":"Service is Terrible all the servers stand around and flirt with one another. Hot dogs are gross, burgers are mediocre at best. The drinks aren't very good either and no blender? Won't return."}
{"text":"The Good 
Dirty young girls serve you with tattoos and the beer selection is excellent as well as served cold. Good spot to watch a game and drink . 

Bad 
The burgers sound good but are tasteless and the bread they serve them on sucks. Bagged French-fries are you kidding 

The Ugly   
Watching the staff at work is like watching high school kids  at lunch time plenty of drama and posing. I see many strippers in these girls future ."}
{"text":"Very great food options and bartenders were welcoming! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves Cheese burgers.  I feel like he has to try everyone's burgers in town.  I can't turn down a great burger either.  I had ordered through door dash.  It's so hot out here it's worth the price! I ordered the steakhouse Truffle..... Medium rare and with tater tots. On a toasted to perfection pretzel roll.   The burger was one of the richest perfectly seasoned and well thought out burgers I've had in a long time.  The thyme roasted tomato is so amazing.  I would order again and again.  I'm hooked. My boyfriend ordered the Bacon Bleu, medium rare,  with Fries but instead they gave him chips.  At first he was disappointed about the chips, until he tried one of those perfectly seasoned chips that seem to be fried in some kind of special oil.  He loved them!!!  He also thought his burger was grilled to perfection.  The pretzel roll was toasted well and stood up to that big patty with cheese. Way to go Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan. The cheeseburgers are fantastic, the beer is super cold, and the service is reasonable. The atmosphere is bright and open with plenty of TVs and a large patio. The location is also superb with countless nightlife options within walking distance. Ice buckets built into the tables is a neat idea."}
{"text":"After the first time I came to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers, I stewed on this restaurant for awhile. I wanted to write a review but I really wasn't sure how to rate it. After visiting the restaurant once more, I've come to a conclusion. CB&C (that's what I'll call it for ease of writing) has a great selection of beers, which they should as its in the namesake. However, a great selection of beer is pretty commonplace these days. I for one am thrilled that large selections of craft beers are everywhere now, but places like CB&C may suffer. Having thirty, even forty beers doesn't set you apart anymore, at least not as much as five years ago. I think some extra praise is warranted for the extra beer selection but not as much as maybe a few years ago.  

I feel that, given the ubiquity of craft beer joints, I'm left to judge CB&C by its food. The burgers are good, in fact I'd say a bit above average. The meat itself was pretty tender, well done. We all ordered different temperatures and for the most part they came out medium rare. Not the end of the world and I'm sure on a busy night its not easy to get it perfect but none of us saw much difference in meat color or temperature despite some of us wanting it bloodier than others. The fries were pretty decent, a little heavy on the seasoning in my opinion but everyone seemed to enjoy them.

Where CB&C fell flat for our group both times was the mac and cheese and appetizers. They promoted the macaroni pretty heavily one of the times we were there, the waitress assuring us that it was one of their best, most popular items. The portion sizes were decent but the cost was a bit steep for mac and cheese, and none of us found it much to write home about. It seemed as though there wasn't much inspiration in the seasoning or cheese selection. We also ordered a few appetizers to start and most of them seemed prepackaged. Maybe they weren't but they could've been sitting out for awhile for all I know, the hummus already had a crust on it. 

Overall, CB&C is your average, run-of-the-mill burger and beer joint that charges above average prices. Nothing this place is doing is revolutionary but they'd still be one of my top choices in Old Town if I wanted to eat and get out to the bars in a reasonable amount of time. If you're looking for something easy before a night out, I think CB&C is fine for that. I'd stick to the burgers, fries, and beer though, definitely the best thing about this place."}
{"text":"Ate here last night after arriving to Scottsdale at 1030 PM.   Bartender was very good, friendly and funny.  I ordered a burger which came out perfect.  Great selection of craft brews."}
{"text":"I am so glad there's a great bar in this spot!  I recently stopped in for happy hour with some friends.  They kept talking about the Build Your Mac n' Cheese.  They have a great beer selection on tap and in bottles.  Happy Hour specials include reduced rates on beer, well drinks and some appetizers.  The Hummus & Pita plate and Grilled Asparagus was a greater starter.  

By the recommendation of the Bartender, I went with the Golden Mustard Grilled Drummettes.  OMG so delicious! Best combination of sweet and spicy.  Another bonus: you get Blue Cheese dressing.  The BYOB Mac n' Cheese options are amazing.  Not only does it come with American, Pepper Jack and Provolone, but you can add another cheese.  They have several meat options such as Bacon, Ground Chuck and Chicken.  

This will be a great place to watch sports.  They have so many TVs it's hard to focus on one screen.  I cannot wait to come back and check out the huge patio.  This will be a great spot for some day drinking."}
{"text":"this place had some legit spicy chicken dip. we got that and a few random brews. they had a large selection of beer and they had the blackhawks game on which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic service, yummy burgers and to-die for tot chos! My husband and I ordered a half order of the tot chos and shared a burger entree, which was plenty for us both. Their servings are, surprisingly, generous!"}
{"text":"Super great service.  We tried the chili Mac and it is awesome.  I had the Asian chicken salad, fresh potato chips and onion rings.  It was all delicious.  My only beef with the place is that it's really loud with basketball and hockey games on. It's a great party atmosphere. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great food! Some unique turns on classic cuisine.  Buffalo chicken dip was pretty darn good. As were the truffle fries and Mac and cheese burger. Service was very attentive and the prices were about par for Scottsdale. 
Plenty of TVs holding up the walls like crown molding so it's probably a good bar to hit up for football Sunday. I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"The price for what you get is 5 stars, honestly burger rehab we should have waited the one our wait and not walked the distance in the 100+ degree weather! It'll happen though after a few margaritas and guacamole."}
{"text":"I ordered a Moscow Mule at the bar and they brought it in a fake copper mug. So, I asked if they have real mugs.  The bartender said they got stolen, she might have one, pulled one out. Okay. Great. She poured it into the new, larger mug, added ice and water to it. Ummmm okay. I tried it, thought what if it's still good? Yeah, no! Grossss. I asked her if she can make make me another, her response: \"you can order something else if you didn't like it.\"  Okaaaayyy... I'm guessing she doesn't know how to make this specific drink?? 

We were seated at this point so I ordered their version of Bloody Mary. It was, meehh... I had a few sips. We ordered the origins tots with guac, chili, and sour cream. They were okay, nothing out of this world. It was too salty for my pallet. 

The ambiance was good. They have a lot of TVs with different sports playing on them. Good crowd in general, a good mix of twenty somethings all the way to fifty somethings. 

Our server was great. She stopped by to check on us frequently, was courteous. 

Overall, I would recommend this place if you're looking for a fun hang out with friends. It's not for gourmet food and drinks.  I had a good time with my friend. Don't order a Moscow Mule or a mixed drink, beers are probably safe."}
{"text":"Olivia was a majestic titan of arriving beers and being EXTREMELY attentive. Without a doubt the best server and locAtion to drink a smoking cold beer and to have a full court press of attention to the real guys who LOVE beer. The beer is so damn cold your lips lose the grips to reality. Your stomach starts into the matrix as if you just downed 50 red pills. Safe to say, this place is amazing. Of course due to Olivia."}
{"text":"Food was well below average/ service slow and during the NCAA Tourney people are watching certain games and they kept switching the TVs around and moving the sound to games that were just starting instead of close games that were coming to a close.  Not coming here again."}
{"text":"Great spot! I've gone to the location in Phoenix on 7th st and the location in old town Scottsdale and both visits were great! My favorite burger is definitely the Juicy Lucy-fer. The location in Scottsdale is my go-to! The atmosphere is super casual with some good music playing. The staff is super friendly and not overbearing! I tried their Micheladas at my most recent visit and I gotta say, goddamn. Haha they also honored the 10% yelp offer with no questions and that's always refreshing. It's a great spot for friends, lunch or a date! Definitely gonna be back!"}
{"text":"I love the patio especially on a nice day- they have misters going so its the right temperature even when its 100 degrees.

The menu has all sorts of burger combos and there's a good selection of appetizers or other food if youre feeling adventurous...

They also allow you to pick your own 6 pack with all the various beers they have available. Then they throw ice in the cooler on the table in order to keep the beer cold.(hence the name)

Id recommend this spot if youre going to watch a game or just to enjoy a scottsdale day/evening."}
{"text":"Great selection of burgers and beer. Incredibly loud inside. I like a place with a vibrant atmosphere but it was tough to converse with each other and our server. Food was just ok. Totally unnecessary AC blowing right over our table cooled the food off very quickly. Cold cheeseburgers and beer, anyone?"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and staff.  The bartenders are attentative and friendly and their sunday bloody mary bar is something else.  A great place to watch any type of sporting events since they have almost 20 TVs surrounding you.  Their outdoor patio is awesome."}
{"text":"awesome food, ambiance, environment and cost. The burgers are phenomenal and when checking into Yelp you get $5 off your bill. It's basically a free beer. One of my favorite places downtown and love going here as much as possible. Service is great and again great food."}
{"text":"The over all experience of the service and food was great. The bartenders were on point and management was very attentive. Ordered a build your own burger and it was on point drinks were a-little pricey but over all a great place to catch up with fiends and family. Great out door seating available"}
{"text":"If you haven't had the make-your-own macaroni and cheese, you are missing out. Was a bit nervous going to a cheeseburger place as a vegetarian, but was pleasently surprised at the selection. I always recommend this place to my friends when we are in Old Town."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was good, the beer was cold and a lots of options.  Cool trendy atmosphere, kinda indoor and outdoor all in one.  I give it a 4 instead of a 5 for a couple of reasons, it was a solid burger, not the best I've had but definitely above average.  I felt it was s little pricey for what it was, I wouldn't rate it as a great value but not crazy overpriced... I'd go again"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now and food has been consistently good. I recommend the burgers, wings, mac and cheese, and tater tots. Decent selection of wines but beers aren't very cold. The bathroom set up is kind of awkward. It doesn't flow. The wide doors all open out so potentially you could hit one another. Be careful! It does get a little pricey outside of happy hour. Plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Went once with my girlfriend. It's nice they have gluten-free buns which she needs! Super bar atmosphere so if you do not like, don't go here. Very sports bar at that. Nice place though, service was good but overpriced for what we got. It was just a burger in the end. Nice place but nothing super special, but again, have gluten free options which is nice for someone with an allergy. Good location also to add."}
{"text":"Great spot to hang out and watch the game! Chicken fingers are awesome and burgers are even better! Great beer/drink selection and the vibe is cool. Service is good and they even have heaters on the outdoor patio for us in az that complain about anything being cold"}
{"text":"The burger selection is LEGIT! Many different options and combinations! Juicy and DELISH! Lots of tvs and tap selection is a  plenty!!"}
{"text":"Ordered: Buffalo chicken egg rolls, Chicago dog. Bill $19

Candice did a great job!! Very quick, nice and helpful. :) 

Cold beers has some of the best selections of beers with great food. One of the best sports bar settings with food that is incredibly well done. I'm never disappointed. Great spot to watch a game, catch a beer, or just eat a burger/hot dog. 

The buffalo chicken egg rolls are friggin delicious. If you like hot wings and blue cheese you will love these. 

The Chicago dog is authentically done with bright neon green relish, onions, peppers, tomatoes, and  NO ketchup (unless you add it). 

My favorite beer here is the Sonoran White Chocolate draught."}
{"text":"I had about an hour or so to kill before a flight and was dragging around a rolly suitcase (i.e. had no desire to try to sight-see), and stumbled across this place. Got myself a cider and sat down to read and occasionally watch Sportcenter at the bar. Service was mostly prompt, though I had to really flag the dude down for my check. 

I got a hangover burger and was duly impressed by two things: it actually was rare, and the egg was runny. Usually both burger and egg tend to come overcooked whenever I've ordered them elsewhere, so I was psyched. The bacon was also excellent. Pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers is right in old town Scottsdale just south of Camelback, covered parking behind restaurant.  Trendy spot with inside and outside seating - misters seem to cool down the patio.  

Server was friendly and speedy

Came with a group of Friends for Trivia night and it was a blast. 

Adult beverage are nice and cold and refreshing.  Got the Mmmac & Cheeseburger and it was all that the name is, the burger had Mac and Cheese and Grilled tomatoes - mighty tasty.  The best part was the Sweet Potato Totes DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"My experience with this establishment was 'meh', at best. My friend and his girlfriend took me to this establishment because it was a place that they have been to in the past and their experience was, overall, positive. Not to say it was the dinner of a lifetime, but they did like the buffalo dip there.

When we arrived, the atmosphere itself was bright and a pleasant. There was quite a bit people around due to Spring Training, but we couldn't complain...that's why we were there, ha. Everything from the environment, layout, and cleanliness of the place was fine. It was a casual, comfortable atmosphere. The issues of our time were really brought on due to service. 

THE WAITRESS
Alright, first things first, I am not going to mention any names. At the end of the day, she is a person, everyone makes mistakes, and our experience with her may differ from others who have had her in the past (or future). My impression of her was that she was fairly new. When she arrived at our table, the three of us all felt a little shocked. Her clothing choice was...not what we expected? She may not have noticed but her shirt was a crop-top with a very sloping front. It essentially, when down that low, looked like a sports bra... Now, to each their own, but I will say it did make us a bit uncomfortable for her to be wearing revealing clothing to such a degree. If it were a Twin Peaks (or) Hooters, totally would get it, but we just were caught off guard with so many kids/families around. It appeared she was the only one dressed this way (or this little) but, in the end, this I guess is based on the restaurant's dress code. If they're okay with it, it doesn't really affect me. I'm just a passerby in this situation.

When she was taking our drink orders, one person in our party had requested what she would recommend since our friend has never ordered a drink here before. She didn't really offer any advice, however. She simply stated she was only 20 and couldn't offer any suggestions to us. That was that. She didn't really engage or offer to ask someone that would help us. You would think someone that has 'Cold Beer' in the title, giving some education on alcoholic drinks would be given. I'm glad this woman doesn't condone underage drinking, but why wouldn't she ask what she liked and told the bartender/someone 21+ working? Anyway, she brought the person in our party a refresher because a lot of people buy it, of which she had  1/2 than stopped because she doesn't like basil.

THE CHIP FIASCO
We had the buffalo chicken dip with chips and it was fine. It is got QUITE a kick to it, so be aware. It's very much on the spicier end. We also noticed that they didn't really give a lot of chips with it. We weren't even halfway done before we ran out. We asked for me, the waitress obliged, and we had a little bucket, probably slightly smaller than my fist worth. We asked for one more just because it was so little, she obliged. All that said, when we received the bill...we noticed we were being charged for them. Something the waitress made no attempt to even mention. When my friend questioned his bill she was kind of put off and said you get one free but after that we were going to be charged for additional appetizers. Which, does make sense, but I believe my friend was a little perturbed nothing was said. Why was that not mentioned when we ordered them?

In the end, he did speak with the manager and the issue was resolved. The manager made the point, \"if we charged for free amount of chips we'd probably be out of business.\" Not certain how relevant or factual that statement is, but we reiterated to him it was not the issue of charging it was the issue no one told us \"the rules\". We were just asking because we were out and received a very limited quantity in ratio to the amount of dip. I thought the remark was a bit uncalled for since none of us were being loud, mean, or angry... We were just curious why no one said anything. We didn't really give an aggressive tone to be retaliated against. It was just weird.

Clearly, our experience was disappointing. The food was alright. The drinks were okay-priced, but the service we received was really what put a bad taste in my mouth. I'm not sure I'll return to this place. I'm sad because it was \"vacation time\" for me and this wasn't really a fun stop-off like we were hoping. Plus, I hate writing bad reviews, but I honestly couldn't in good conscious give this place more than two stars based on our experience."}
{"text":"I did not have any great expectations walking into this place. The place looks like the typical sports bar, pretty \"plastic\" with TV screens everywhere, laminated menus a la Denny's and very young personnel.  We were however pleasantly surprised, the food was excellent (burger and salads) and our waitress Nadine who didn't look more than 16, was very good at her job."}
{"text":"They get right to the point at this great sports bar, even when naming it.  Came here on a recent visit to Scottsdale to catch the Rangers-Penguins playoff game.  This is an ideal place to watch sports of pretty much any kind (with the exception of MLS soccer, which they didn't have).  TVs are massive and plentiful, as are the delicious beers.  I don't think there was a single bad seat to watch a game in the large dining area.  They've also got a patio area with plentiful seating, if you're lucky enough to catch a day that's cooler than melting. The beer list is enormous and you're sure to find something you enjoy on it.  Even the restrooms were impressive given with how clean, spacious and well decorated they were.  I saw a few of the eponymous cheeseburgers pass my table and I could tell, from the looks on people's faces as they took the first bites, that they were delicious.  Great place to hang out with friends, especially with a large group."}
{"text":"Here for the first time, huge UFC fight. So great. Servers were attentive even as packed as it was! So many beers on tap! Pretzels AMAZING! Must get Prim Dip sandwhich! Will come back!"}
{"text":"Very laid back atmosphere, open garage door/patio area, classic rock music.  Good selection of beer and ciders on hand.  My burger was awesome-giant sized and tasted great!  The Lucy Jucy has cheese grilled inside the patty so it didn't slide apart.  The bartender helped me find a great local beer on tap (Papago Orange Blossom) which is an easy drinking  ale especially if you like fruit beers.  Try it out if you're in town!"}
{"text":"Well, how can you really complain to much about a Sport Bar when your team wins!  Everything is better when your team wins!  Last week I was on a mission to watch the Vikings play, but I was in a land of the unknown being in Scottsdale on Vacation.  
I found a great spot I could sit outside, while still sitting at the bar and watch multiple games at once. 
Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers is pretty much what it says!  Lots of beers to choose, (mind you slightly over priced ones). 
I choose the PBR tall boy it was the only beer 4 bucks or under on the menu and I had 5 of them during the 3 1/2 hours I was there!  

Ashley got breakfast there and she says is was kinda ok. All I know is that the scrambled eggs looked weird to me!  Now I'm egg expert but they looked gross! 
The burgers that kept coming out of the kitchen looked a little more appealing! 

The staff was nice and kept me hydrated during the game and didn't balk that I brought an outside coffee in to finish before switching to brews! 

The atmosphere was pretty nut-so during the games and it got packed fast!  You might want to show up early on game day! 

I find it a little disturbing that you can buy the staff a 6 pack of beers to share after their shift on the menu.. Now normally I would dig this idea, but the 6 pack of beers were priced way cheaper then the actual menu price!  Kinda made me feel ripped off paying 4 bucks for a tall boy!  (which is not a bad price, but the only option under 5 bucks.. Kinda makes it a bummer)"}
{"text":"Came here this past Sunday for game-day and while I expected any bar/restaurant to be crowded on that day, this place was pretty insane. Not to mention, the acoustics are awful in the place. You had to literally shout at your bartender/waitress and even the person sitting next to you.

I will probably come back on an off-game day for late lunch or happy hour to get a better feel but my first impression was \"meh\".  

Oh, and $7 for a fireball shot? Who are you kidding?!"}
{"text":"Eh. The food here is alright, Mac n cheese is definitely good. But the burgers can get kind of expensive (especially if you think about all the other awesome burger joints around the area). Any slightest type of \"upgrade\" or \"trade out\" adds to the tab. Last time I went, I got a vodka soda, a burger with a pretzel bun, had to add fries, and my bill was in the $30+ range. Not ridiculous but still a bit pricey for what I got, in my opinion. Service is usually so so, as well."}
{"text":"I chose 4-stars for Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers because on Yelp, you'll notice 3 stars just means \"A-OK\" and 4 stars means, \"Yay! I'm a fan.\" Well I wouldn't call this place my favorite, I'm definitely a fan. This past visit wasn't my first time here, I've been to the Grayhawk location as well twice. I find it tasty every time I go, no matter which location I stroll into. 

My boyfriend, friends, and I were looking for a spot to settle down for some beers, food, and Sunday Football in Old Town. Naturally almost everywhere we went was packed but even though Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers was very busy, we were seated right away. The staff was friendly and patient. 

They have a beer of the month that's only $3 for a pint, so I ordered that and was not disappointed. They have a lengthy list of beers (hence the name) that every beer lover will find appetizing. We started with the parmesan truffle fries that were very yummy. I would have like an aioli to go with the fries but it was so busy I chose to hold back this time and go with the ketchup on the table. 

Now I ordered the cheeseburger sliders with caramelized onions and au jus. Three little perfect and juicy sliders cooked to perfection and the au jus is such a good call on their part!! My boyfriend ordered the Open Pit burger that was gone before I got to ask him for a bite. Clearly he loved it. All other orders around the table looked awesome and there were no complaints from the six of us. 

They had both games we wanted to see on TV in plain sight which was awesome. BONUS: If you check-in on Yelp for the first time, you get $5 off your bill! Don't forget to check-in!!

I'd definitely go back there to watch more sporting events with friends and eat great bar food."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a tasty burger this place rocks. The food is tasty and the beer is good. The waitresses are also as you would expect at this establishment. Less family friendly but they have been accommodating to us day or night. You need to eat here while in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great first visit! Food was uhhhhmazing! We will definitely be back when in the Old Town Scottsdale area. We got the Rocky point burger and the tater tots. Even kids macaroni was good!"}
{"text":"Build your mac Monday and build your burger Wednesday. That's one good thing, that's another good thing, that's two good things... AWWWWW YEAAAAAHHHHH. 

If I wanted to be fatter than Pluto then I would be here two times a week, every week, but I can't do that to myself nor my wallet. My burger consisted of everything you could imagine you'd want on a burger and it tasted like the great Zeus stroked my taste buds with a lightening bolt to energize the sensation of flavor about to consume my mouth. 

Yum"}
{"text":"Met my AOB buddy S here for lunch. I needed to pick up a gift card so I figured I might as well grab lunch while I was there and S happened to be available.
Parking can be difficult in Scottsdale but there is a parking garage right behind CB&CB so it's easy. The restaurant was about half full on a Monday. Our server was Alison. She was very nice and did a good job of keeping our drinks filled and making sure our needs were met.
S ordered the Pittsburger w/ Chips ($12.0O). The chips come with and he ordered his patty Medium Rare. This burger comes with American Cheese, Cole Slaw, French Fries & Grilled Tomato. S's patty was more medium than medium rare so he was a little disappointed with that. I would have to agree that for 12 bones the patty should be perfect. Other than that, S enjoyed it.
I ordered the Hangover ($12.00) with Fries ($2.00). First, my medium rare was medium rare, so good job there. Second, charging 2 bucks to add fries to a 12 dollar burger is a joke. Probably why the place was only half filled at lunch time. The Hangover comes with Jack Cheese, Bacon, Caramelized Onion, Grilled Tomato and an over easy egg. Next to the patty, the egg is the next most important protein here and needs to be done right. Overlooked and it's just a hard cooked egg on a burger. Too rare and it's just a liquid mess and kinda gross. This egg was perfect. I cut through the burger and yolk oooozed over the patty. Yum. Winner winner burger dinner.
I do think the $2 charge to sub fries for the chips is a joke.
On a good note we did get a 10% discount with a Yelp check-in so basically the fries were covered with a little extra off.
Great service. Good burgers. High prices. Clean facility. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"Burgers- check
beers and spirits - check
Plenty of tvs - check

This is a hip and hopping sports bar. Fun place to watch any sporting event. I've been here a few times and though the customer service was good, the food was okay.

We ordered the bacon cheeseburger, nachos, Mac-n-cheese, and the Tatter tots."}
{"text":"UPDATE!

They fixed the zoomed in TV that night! I however had one to many of their delicious beers and forgot to update my review. Better late than never!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here greatly - wings, tot-chos, and a good beer selection. The service can be severely hit or miss. Expect the worst and be happy if it's any better."}
{"text":"Oh no! I'm the worst kind of guest. I came, I ate, I drank and I failed to send a thank you card.  I joined a group of fellow Yelpers for a Wednesday Happy Hour. (Jeff E. is awesome at planning Yelp unofficial events.) We rolled our way out fatter and happier.

THIS BURGER BUSINESS
I like a good challenge. When I heard I could pile on unlimited toppings the game was on. I triple confirmed the pricing on Wednesday is a flat $10 NO MATTER WHAT. Like a speed demon I selected a bun (pretzel!), a protein (angus beef) and a cheese (gruyere). My pencil hovered over veges. (Yes to jalape√±os and caramelized onions. No one to kiss that night. Boo! Hiss!) 

I heard someone at my table order avocados on the side. \"Ooo! Good idea. Check.\" While in that section I thought, \"Hmmm...what about an egg? You've never had an egg on your burger. WHY NOT?\" 

[Shrug]
People. I hadn't been to the gym in three months. What's little bit of caloric love?

At Step Six I tossed in lettuce, tomato and mayo. I circled back and opted for some regular onions. (Again, no prince that night. I like a bit of crunch to my burger.) I topped off my rare burger with a tangy chipotle sauce and a side of sweet potato tots. (Interestingly enough you can top your burger with Steakhouse Herb Butter. How curious!)

God bless our server that night. I have to poll my friends to see if anyone can remember who helped us. She was the Shizzle. Patient, on top of our beer orders like a ninja and sweet as pie. We must have asked one thousand questions.

FIRE FIRE FIRE
While eagerly awaiting my mountain of food Jeff ordered \"The Hell Fire Chips\". I scoffed when I heard they were hot. Potato chips, buffalo sauce and blue cheese.  

My tongue thanks beer for its many healing powers. Speaking of beer, Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers was serving a Black Butte Porter at the time. I really hope they still have it on tap!

Back to the flame. Ursula had ordered something called TOT CHOS. Think of nachos, layered with chili, sour cream, guac and roasted pepper cheese sauce. Got that? Except the base is on tater tots! Also FIRE. A half order can easily be shared.

When The Burger finally rolled out my eyes opened like saucers. Cutting it with a knife clearly wasn't going to help! It wasn't pretty eating, but, oh boy was it yummy!

There were left overs. Good place. Fun!

Oh! Oh! Oh!
I just heard. The restaurant is still offering the same Yelp check-in offer. $5 off your order! GET IT!"}
{"text":"This place was great!!! Burgers were off the hook great. All of these bad reviews are small people that have to complain to make a name. The build a burger was perfect. The waitress actually saved me money on a recommendation. Thank you! For the management: you have a great place with great servers. Be nice. That's your X factor. Anyway. Great place. But. Apparently beers aren't a free refill. Darn it. They kept bringing, I kept drinking. Thank you again"}
{"text":"Update*
   They have new managers and staff that are AMAZING!!
  I have been coming every Thursday for Trivia and I  have to say the new Manager Todd is such a great asset to the brand. He makes sure that every regular in our group is greeted and enjoying our meal and experience. We feel valued and welcomed by him every time and we have been coming every Thursday since March! The outside server we like to request is Jordan, she very attentive and has never once messed up an order and even remembers what we order. It's such a nice change  from the past staff that would barely make eye contact and wouldn't even come back after Drinks to put food in. They also have a Barback there named Cru! He is probably one of the hardest working employees of this establishment. Our group which is sometimes 14 plus always like to make sure to say hi to him. He is always on top of everything and making sure we are completely taken care of I hope to see him in management with the company. I also want to include Mark in this! Thanks for always being so nice and accommodating. 

 Let's talk Food & Drinks
Best drink, east bound and down 
Fav appetizer, the chicken tenders and fries. You need to order it with buffalo sauce to dip and blue cheese! You'll thank me later! 
- The Mac & Cheese is pretty yummy!
Stay away from the pretzel..... not the best thing on the menu. 
Buffalo chicken tots are always a standard"}
{"text":"If you need a cold beer and a cheeseburger while watching a game, this is surely your spot. Each time I've been in, I sat at the bar. Bartenders are all friendly and don't leave you waiting too long before filling up an empty beer glass. What I have noticed though is that nobody runs bar food. If you order something from the bar, make sure you check the time and ask for it every five minutes. Otherwise, the bartenders forget to check on your food. 

This last time, we waited nearly 30 minutes for food. Didn't think a whole lot of it since the place was a little busy. But our entrees were clearly sitting under the heat lamp for a while. Bottom buns on our burgers were super soggy, while the tops were dried to a crisp. Maybe you get quicker food service by sitting at a table. As for the bar though, I'll just stick to beer, not food."}
{"text":"This review is somewhat unfair. I did go with a giant group of Yelpers, so I cannot say if the most excellent and amazing service was due to that, or if it is always like that, but I can say that, at least that night, the service was wonderful. The manager (who seemed to be one of the yelper's friends possibly?) was amazing. He was attentive without being overbearing and he remembered all of our names... that's right, like 25 of our names.... that is insanity! We came for happy hour and build your own burgers and happy it was! They had many delicious beers on tap, with the local beers being on special for 4$. I had a Four Peaks peach... it was delish, as per usual. The build your own burger deal is pretty amazing, you fill out an order form with all of the toppings you would like for 10$. I think I put too many toppings on....here is the run down on my ridic burger:

Pretzel bun
Angus beef
gruyere and cheddar cheese
roasted tomato, caramelized onion, roasted green chilis, jalapenos, guac
steakhouse butter
bacon
over easy egg
hot sauce... on the side.



That's right... this was burgerious maximus. Unfortunately, when the burger came out it was missing several of the toppings (including the bacon, blasphemy!) and the over easy egg was nearly cooked through. This was a little disappointing, but maybe was a blessing, because this burger was monsterous, hard to eat, a total mess, and delicious the way it was. Would I like bacon next time? Yes, definitely. But I will try to edit myself....*try* being the operative word. I could only eat half and I was sooo full. I also had sweet potato tots.. they were good, but after trying someone else's chips...those are definitely the way to go. 

As others have mentioned, they have a great Yelp check in special... 5$ off, and they honored it for all of us, which was totally unnecessary, but much appreciated. I will gladly return!"}
{"text":"Juicy juicy juicy burgers need I say more also a great place to pick up chicks  before heading out to the clubs or bars"}
{"text":"Honestly I didn't expect much from this place. But after staying for a few beers and watching a few sporting events I was convinced this was the place to go. My server was named Olivia and I would highly recommend her to anybody who's coming from out of town. A fun place, probably to go with a group. Very pleased. Ask for Olivia."}
{"text":"I hesitate to give this place a 2 star, because as a vegetarian, I LOVE their amazing veggie patties that you can sub for any burger. In the couple of times I've visited CBC I've had the ring of fire and the rocky point and I've loved them both-- and the sweet potato tots? Amazing! 

However, on the occasions I've been to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers, the service is terrible! The food can take upwards of 45 minutes to get to your table, and in that time no explanation is offered as to why, even when it isn't a busy game night or weekend. The server appears to take your drink order and your food order and disappears for the remainder of your stay until it's time to bring the bill. I'm a pretty understanding person, and forgive that when it's busy; but to happen on several occasions? No thank you. While the food is fantastic, it's a shame because the service downgrades this place significantly.

**Edit** Management contacted me and rectified the situation, which I appreciate greatly. I will have to give CB&C another chance."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend staying in town at this place, thought it was just going to be another burger joint. Got there and tons of tvs to watch the games on, had a blast and great staff. Plenty of beer on tap if that's your thing. More of a mix drinker myself but the beer is definitely cold and the burgers are great."}
{"text":"Well, it has been a few months, and I have been back here a handful of times. I have now tried a few of the burgers, a couple different mac and cheeses (including the chili mac), and the parmesan truffle fries. Everything has been really great. I think my favorites are the chili mac and the steakhouse burger so far.

The service, however, has been hit or miss. Nothing horrible, but never as good as my first visit. We have had a couple less than attentive servers and there was one visit where the music from the kitchen was loud enough to be annoying, but mostly because it was clashing with the music they were playing in the dinning area. Like I said, not horrible, but not great.

With that said, the food and beer are great, but the inconsistent service won't let me justify changing my review to a 5. I would give the food a 4.5 and the service a 3.5 if it were possible to break it down like that."}

{"text":"Atmosphere is great for sports - lots of flat screen TVs. Nice open air with a lot of outside seating. The burgers looked great but we did not try as was too much food for us but realized afterwards that we probably should have. Pretzels with dip were very good. Buffalo ranch dip would have been better if not so hot.  Reuben sandwich was ok. Our server was very nice but appeared to be overworked as we had to ask for everything needed - and sometimes twice."}
{"text":"Never lets me down.... I'm a hardcore greenbay fan! Get into the games more then anything.... So whe you have a server who finally comes to meet you in the middle of a play and talks to you while a touchdown is going on.....

If you are a burger place and offer different temps you should know how to cook all the temps. My dads soda got one fill because the lack of service and burgers are mediocre.. As I would like to think it was just a bad night I will try them again sometime hopefully it won't be as disappointing. If only there was a stout burgers and beer in AZ  ...."}

{"text":"I really liked the ambiance of this place! There is supposed to be one opening near our house near 67th Ave and Deer Valley Rd in North Peoria/Glendale area. I can't wait to have a cool bar/grill to hang out at and be able to also take the family! 

This place in Scottsdale was cool, the location was great and our service was great too. We went for a girlfriend of mine's birthday last month. About 5 of us total, we did a little bar hopping and enjoyed this place as a chill hang out with good drinks and food!! 
We had the buffalo dip- YUM! And a couple other things but the dip is what I remember most! Haha The drinks were good and not weak, my hubby even made a comment about it, so that's saying something. I hope the location by us will be similar! :) They would have some regulars on their hands over here. 

Overall I definitely recommend it and would go back to the Scottsdale location, however I am looking forward to the location that will be opening up near us soon. :)"}
{"text":"More like cold shits and diarrhea. Grilled Cheese had two hairs stuck in the cheese with no avocado (when I asked for some) and bacon (when I asked for none) as well as cold fries. The waitresses would only stop by my table every 20 minutes so I couldn't even tell her it was messed up. Got our check and there was an extra $11 charge for wings we never ordered and the waitress AGAIN was nowhere to be found so we couldn't let her know. We had to track down a random busser to get someone to fix the problem. Wings finally taken off the check and waitress AGAIN was nowhere to be found for another 30 minutes. She didn't even seem like she wanted us to pay her. It was like she wanted us to leave without paying so she would be stiffed. We finally gave our check to the manager so we could pay and leave. Two hours longer than we wanted to be there. ITS CALLED A SENSE OF URGENCY PEOPLE."}
{"text":"I've been to CBCB multiple times. I've always loved the experience, the food, and the service. However this evening was a little different. Our server was a young lady (Sasha, I believe) who was not so attentive to myself and my boyfriend. We had to wave her over a few times and kept trying to get her attention. It made for a very poor and (very odd to say) awkward dining experience.
I also found it strange I was paying $2 for three slivers of avocado. I was expecting a little more. I understand mark up but it was not worth $2. Next time I'll hide my own avocados in my purse and put it on my burger."}
{"text":"I'm pretty indifferent to the restaurants in this area of Old Town; however, CB&C is a treat. 

First of all, you know what you're getting. They have a great variety of burgers and plenty of beers to choose from (almost too many). My favorite burger is the steakhouse truffle which can be accompanied by a number of side dish options, I usually go with sweet potato tots. Their other food is good too but if you're going for a first time I'd start out with a burger, they're bound to have one you'll like. 

You can tell Cold Beers puts an emphasis on the quality of their food, unlike other places in the area who seem to try and get by off the location and ambience. It can get a little crowded but that's to be expected, especially in the winter and spring seasons. This has become a great go-to spot when trying to grab a bite and watch a game. 

Oh yeah, you also get $5 off with a yelp check in!!"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for our office (which I do everyday) which should have been fairly simple. The original person who took my order decided to pass my order off to another employee instead of putting it in themselves. This was the first mistake (hasn't anyone ever played the game telephone?)

Each order was put on a seperate check so I had to wait for them to put it all back together. Two out of the four orders I ordered were incorrect. When I brought it up, the hostess looked at me confused and I had to ask her to fix the mistakes. They then charged me an addition $2 to split a salad which I was never told prior. When I got back to the office, I realized that there were no condiments with the food, one of the mistakes was never fixed and the the plastic silverware was so cheap, why even bother giving them?

However, after waiting 10 minutes for the servers to finally ask for a manager to come help, most of the issues were rectified (putting the orders on one check and removing the $2 split charge). The food was mediocre but it's only the first month of the location being open. Hopefully they will get the hang of things and I'll come try again."}
{"text":"Very similar to the rest of the cold beers & cheeseburgers. This is the original. Was the largest until the new one opened up in North Scottsdale. Good attempt of Staff. Freshly made food. Even though tonight the fries and onion rings were Cold n undercooked they took care of it. All in all and good experience right on Scottsdale Road. Lots of nice scenery."}
{"text":"Best turkey burger ever! I love that you can get any burger with a made from scratch turkey patty! And don't even get me started on the tater tots... Yum!!!! Great place to watch sports especially if you are sitting at the bar when Kerri S is working!!! She is so attentive, super friendly and takes such great care of me every time! She definitely makes the CBCB experience absolutely wonderful with all her great suggestions and fun personality!"}
{"text":"Completely messed up my order. I asked for a burger wrapped In lettuce and fresh onions and gave me a patty with no lettuce and a little cup of the carmalized onions. It was soggy and disgusting and cost me $13.00. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here because I wanted to try a \"Juicy Lucy\".  My burger was fine, but there was nothing remarkable about it.  I also had the Tater Tots, but they were also pretty unremarkable.  

Service was efficient and friendly, but I don't feel a need to return."}
{"text":"As usual, this place was awesome. Brianna was our server and was fantastic! We tried the hummus, which came with 2 types, regular and cilantro. I didnt care for the cilantro one but thats just my taste. Not a huge fan of it. It came with a ton of fresh veggies and warm pita bread. My friend did the buffalo chicken egg rolls. Egg roll wrappers stuffed with buffalo chicken and fried and topped off with bleu cheese. Yum!! She also had the CBCB burger with sweet potato tots. She ate it all so I assume it was great! I had the turkey burger, at Briannas suggestion, 1000 island style. It was cheesy and the lettuce was fresh and crisp. I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor of the turkey but once again, its just my taste. I got the fruit with it and there was a melange of various fruits. We always have great food and service here. Check it out for Blackhawks games as well!"}
{"text":"Most burger joints are mediocre but this place is an exception for me. The burgers here are SO good. I've eaten at this place three times in the span of a month. The burgers are juicy and full of flavors. My personal favorite is the turkey burger. They also have a variety of great sides. I suggest going in small groups since this place does not accommodate large parties. That way you'll get seated faster too. I highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Great new burger spot in the heart of Scottsdale. I think they just opened in the beginning of July '13. I've been 3 times in the first month, and it's been better each time. The service is a little slow, but they're very nice and they made sure I got everything I wanted. I think that once they've been open a while the service will get better. The burgers were excellent each time & came out super hot.

You can make your own burgers or mac n' cheese here, and it comes out exactly how you want it. There's a big list of beers as well as you would expect from their name. There are TV's everywhere and they're all big. I will definitely be coming back here during football season.

Once this place gets their service locked in then it's a 5-star place for a bar/burger/sport type restaurant."}
{"text":"Today was our first time here and we will definitely be back.  Service was good, food was excellent, especially the mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Nice company and cool clientele. Just whenever I get a whiff of those burgers being delivered nearby... what kind a' oil do they those burgers in? Other than that, it's a pretty cool place"}
{"text":"Warm beer, Cold burgers...nuthin' special from this multi-concept group...if ya gonna do a concept; do something different or better (rehab, attic, hoppdoddy, etc.)--just sayin'...ps did give 'em another try @ diff location & better but really nothing to write home about. Bartender initially wasn't very friendly or helpful but kinda warmed up. Burger & beers were ok but not rushin' back..."}
{"text":"Build Your Own Burger Wednesday! So good! Awesome staff and even better tots! I am so thankful for the outside heaters on the patio! Saved my life, coming back Tuesday for 1/2 off bottles of wine and Monday for mac daddy night! I'm going to live here forever lol"}
{"text":"Food is on point. Everything I have ordered is delicious!! The buffalo chicken totchos are awesome not to mention the Mac and cheese and the BURGERS!! Try it out for a game or fight or if you want good American food ;)"}
{"text":"CBCB delivers quality food every time. I've been here easily 10 or so times and each time the food and cocktails have been fantastic. The selection of burgers is just divine. Overall it's your standard sports bar with quality. The noise level gets a little intense inside at times so if you're soft spoken and trying to have a conversation, sit outside."}
{"text":"Food was terrible, server was crabby... wasn't thrilled with this place at all.... overall could give it 0 stars. The entire experience was blah"}
{"text":"not impressed with the old town location. the service was poor, the burgers weren't cooked to temperature (asked for medium rare, but they brought out well done). really...a burger place that can't cook burgers?!?! 

the only good take aways are 

1. solid beer selection, both draft and bottles
2. tons of televisions well placed throughout
3. good happy hour specials

the only way I'd ever go back is for happy hour to get a few hard to find beers."}
{"text":"Excellent and extensive beer selection. More than 40 on tap and another 80 in bottles or cans! BYOB&BYOMC build your own burger/Mac & cheese is absolutely phenomenal! Finally, great people watching sitting on Scottsdale Rd in old town."}
{"text":"This place is great- good burgers, long beer list and tons of tvs. Would totally recommend as a great sports bar option on old town!"}
{"text":"This is a good spot to watch sports and have a beer! The patio is great even in the heat! The service is okay and the food is good! I had the sliders and they were pretty good but nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"Yum, good burgers. I still like Hopdoddys better but this place has good food. The homemade chips are good but not great. Sweet Tater Tots were good but my friend says they are better at Stax. Hamburger was solid. Looks like they have a great beer selection too if that is your thing. It is in the restaurant's name after all. lol"}
{"text":"What a terrible experience. As a first time customer to this location (who has been dying to check out this place) I can say with confidence that I won't be back. Went here for lunch today for a coworkers last day in the office. We had reservations since there was a fairly large party of us (12). The table was set up which was great, the server was taking our drink orders within few minutes of sitting down - also great! Downhill from here.....we waited over an hour for our food. During the hour time frame our server never came back to see if we needed another drink, let us know they were super busy, or ask how we were. When we FINALLY got our food more than half of the table's food was cold, including mine. The burger was barely first pee in the morning warm. The tater tots looked (and tasted) like they had been sitting out for 4 days. The \"split\" between fries and tots as a side ended up coming out as a side of fries, and a side of tots. The BBQ which was supposed to be on the side of my burger (since I didn't want it on the burger) was no where to be found - kinda like our server after she dropped off the food. An hour to wait for the food and it was 15 minutes after the meals were dropped off that the busboy was already taking people's plates, whether they were done or not. 

All and all a completely overpriced place with mediocre food and terrible service."}
{"text":"I love this place, the burgers are always perfect. My favorite has to be the ring of fire burger. It definitely has a good kick to it so you gotta like spicy food, but its awesome. They have some hells fire chips too which are great for an appetizer. Great list of beers and they have a ton of TV if your tryina catch a game or two. The place itself is fun you have the option of sitting outside if its not boiling outside, but luckily it is covered so on a good day there is a nice breeze. If you haven't come here before you have to try it."}
{"text":"First time here arrive on a Sunday afternoon and place was packed but was seated right away. 

Ordered the Hangover Burger with Tater Tots and the 1000 Island Burger with French Fries. Good size burgers and served hot and juicy. Burgers generally come with chips, but of substituted for a side it is $2 extra. 

Burgers are very good and large in size,  the Hangover Burger is egg, bacon and beef patty. This generally is my first choice of combination and enjoy the combination. 

Spencer our waitress was on top of everything and took care of us even though the restaurant was packed. 

The atmosphere is very loud and there are many monitors to watch your favorite event going on. 

First time here but definitely not my last, will be back again."}
{"text":"How is it possible that I've not written a review of CB&C?  WOW.  Let. Me. Fix. That. Right. Now.  Ok,... I have my laptop... Let me Yelp this!

I have been to CB&C several times over the past year.  I love their creative BURGER options.  Their burgers are great.  They have these extra-neat ordering \"forms\" in which you can \"Build Your Own Burger\".  Toppings range from cheese to eggs to grilled tomatoes.  Pro-tip: On Wednesday nights, you can \"Build Your burger\" and fries for $10.  

But, of course, it is just like me to continue to come back to this place, NOT for the Cold Beers and NOT for the CheeseBurgers.  I have had a single burger here in all the times I have gone.  So, what have I been eating you wonder?  For heaven's sake, my weakness is french fries and chips and this place has THE BEST Tater Tots EVER.  On top of it, they have Buffalo Chicken Tots and Cots in which sliced chicken, blue cheese and hot sauce are drizzled/sprinkled over the Tater Tots.  Talk about Tater Tot heaven!  Simply divine.

I hosted a large group here on their patio.  The service was just OK for me.  We had a party of about 28-32 people, but one server.  That annoyed me big time.  The server was nice and cordial, she just didn't have enough hands to move things along faster for a work lunch group.  Alas, I still love this place.

Another great deal, they have a dang-on awesome Yelp Check-in offer too.   

How anyone can justifiably rate a place called \"Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers\" below 3-stars is baffling to me.

My return factor is 100%."}
{"text":"Hell fire chips were so spicy and soggy. They were drenched in hot sauce. We ate like 5 chips, they never asked if the food was good and still charged us for it.

The misters were nice so we could comfortably sit outside."}
{"text":"Fantasy Football Draft HQ!  Great place to host a draft party.  Attentive service, great specials and Guinness in a can!  Ok, full disclosure, my draft was rated an A- so maybe I'm super confident that CB&C had something to do with the results.....but truly, the free wifi was spot on, no connectivity issues and they had plenty of space for our group.

Love this place!"}
{"text":"I feel like this place just raped my day. The waitress obviously doesn't know how to do her job due to the lack of customer service and understanding that she actually have to check up on the tables she is serving. When we asked to speak to the manger she seemed more perplex by the English language than comprehending our compliant. Food was crappy and falling apart. The only good thing about this restaurant is the UofA flag hanging outside, do not come here."}
{"text":"Every single time I have been there I have had amazing service! The staff, owner, food and drinks are above and beyond! After moving to the area just over a month ago we frequent this establishment at least once a week! You will not find nicer people anywhere else!! Love it here!"}
