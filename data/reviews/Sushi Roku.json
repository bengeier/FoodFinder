{"text":"Excellent sushi here. All chef at the bar are Japanese too.  They have traditional Sushi and also creative menus upon request.  I recommend you to sit at counter. Very nice chefs can explain you about where the fish comes from, etc.  
The atmosphere at other tables are more like upscale bar lounge and totally different feeling from the counter.  It is pricy but it worth to try in this town."}
{"text":"I can't go to Vegas without hitting up Sushi Roku...I love everything about it, from the service to the drinks (my favorite is the Tokyo Cooler, although the Pineapple Upside Down Cake martini is a close second) and the view and the food (hanabi, I dream about you!).  

On my most recent visit, my husband and I went for happy hour on a Monday afternoon.  Happy hour is only available at the bar, but it is an amazing deal!  We had a spicy tuna roll and the rock shrimp and jalapeno roll.  Roku has the best spicy tuna of any sushi place I have ever visited.  We also had the popcorn shrimp - ask for a side of spicy mayo to make this even more delicious - and the miso eggplantt.  They even have dessert on their HH menu and how can you go wrong with a mini chocolate volcano cake?"}
{"text":"Made reservations on Opentable but like others have pointed out, it wasn't necessary but still, it was better to be safe than sorry esp on a Thursday night in Las Vegas. 
We were seated by the windows which had a gorgeous view of the strip overlooking the neon lights of Harrah's, Imperial Palace Hotel and Paris in the close distant. 
We started with edamame, closely followed by a tuna tataki salad which had a hinge of too much vinegar but the tuna was good. Then we tried the toro with scallion roll - excellent, melted in the mouth, Roku and roll roll which had combination of 3 fishes, unagi sushi and toro sushi. Then we finished with the Chocolate Volcano which was a warm chocolate cake oozing with chocolate sauce in the center with vanilla bean ice-cream, it was delicious! 3.5 stars. I thought the sushi at Nobu was a tad better. But service was impeccable considering other prime restaurants with very poor and s-l-o-w services in the last few nights!"}
{"text":"It's a treat to go back to Sushi Roku in Scottsdale. My favorite sushi place other than Morimoto's in Napa. However, Sushi Roku's service is leagues ahead. I was on a short trip, this time, and made it a point to go twice for dinner this trip. Logan was our server on my first trip and the first dinner of this trip. He is exceptional in his service, manners, and brilliant recommendations. My second dinner was lovely and interactive thanks to Sarah's service. She made dinner a treat by her wonderful tasting suggestions, and her attentiveness to our experience. Great work Dan, GM for making this establishment so amazing! Service is exceptional. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi a little heavy on the wasabi. But for me very overpriced but I guess that's Vegas."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Staff is super friendly, the atmosphere is fun, but not loud, and they have some great fusionesk appies.  I know sush in the middle of the desert sounds wierd, but it's tasty.

If you come here, look for Victoria.  She awesome!  Great recommendations, perfect delivery, and she's cute, which is always nice!"}
{"text":"Friendly great staff. Some of the sushi is good, and some average. It's pretty expensive. You can get a table with the view of the Strip. I had the Salmon which was good but just expensive. Lol."}
{"text":"in arizona for business and came to sushi roku to celebrate a birthday with some of my employees - ALL of us were so wow'd by our experience!  one of us had a severe gluten allergy but our server Jennah had such amazing recommendations.  she was so patient and attentive!  i didnt expect sushi roku to have such an extensive \"cooked\" portion of their menu too!  the sushi was super fresh and the cocktail list was awesome.  once a server myself, it was nice to see the bus staff, food runners and both managers Mike and Dan, check on us multiple times during the course of our meal on what seemed to be a busy thursday night.  both food and service was spot on!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"}
{"text":"Our waiter sucked. Never told us his name never once smiled. Continually pressured us to order our full meal right away. The restaurant wasn't even busy. He also disappeared for long periods, yet other tables had attentive staff waiting on them. Once he found out we weren't ordering cocktails he stopped trying altogether. The food itself was nothing in particular either. Same as Roka Akor sushi wise. The food wasn't as good as Sumo maya though. Overall massively disappointed in the whole evening (especially considering a vey basic roll was $18.50, we had two appetizers and two rolls coming to $80) and won't be going back."}
{"text":"The best restaurant experience I've had in Las Vegas, regardless of price point. Ask for Joy, she was our server and made the experience personal and memorable to the point that our group of 4 talked about her service and the great food all night and even the next morning. The scallop roll is amazing, but all the rolls we had were great."}
{"text":"Excellent all around. In Scottsdale for the weekend and went here on a Friday night. I'm a tough critic since I'm from Miami and used to great places. This restaurant definitely met my expectations. Great trendy vibe, great food and service. Went to upstairs pool bar afterwards and that was nice too. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner the other evening the food is spectacular and service outstanding! I am gluten free and they were very accommodating to that! If I could give 5 more stars I would !"}
{"text":"Crystal is the best bartender in Scottsdale! We will be back to Sushi Roku just because of her!

HH is great and a good value. Nice place with a personal ambiance, dimly lit at night. Food is outstanding. HH Kobe Skewers FTW!"}
{"text":"We had a fabulous experience here.   The food was amazing, along with the service by Tim.  We went with his recommendations and they did not disappoint.  
Brussel sprout chips and the Japanese Wagyu beef (melt in your mouth) were 2 dishes that really impressed us.   
If you get Tim as your waiter, tell him what you like and go with his recommendations - so worth it!!"}
{"text":"best sushi around; try their loc@ Sunset Blvd (LA)."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here on a lark while on vacation in Vegas. We were both craving sushi and staying on the strip and we just picked this place because it was close and had good reviews. I am so glad we did! Every single thing we ate was absolutely superb! Even the miso soup was amazing! We had shrimp dumplings, makoto rolls, a roll with tuna, shrimp and asparagus and a spicy salmon roll special. All of them were so light and fresh it was unreal. They were also very accommodating to substitutions, as I have an avocado allergy. Service was on point and the atmosphere was dim, but very pleasant. The lava cake was unlike any we had ever had before, and I have had a few! Some people have expressed displeasure with the prices, but we found them to be fair given the area. We live in Miami and most dinners are on par, if not slightly more expensive than the one we had at Sushi Roku. Definitely one of the best sushi restaurants I've ever been to. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi considering you are in the desert. Simple menu, NOT pages and pages of similar tasting rolls. Yellow tale was very good. Order the yellow tale sashimi with green chilies, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"So I have been hearing all about Sushi Roku for months. Everyone was saying how amazing the food was and how they loved the décor but they also said it was pretty pricey. So I thought I would check it out myself. What I didn't know until I got there was they have a few different menus. We ended up sitting in the Lounge and everything on the menu was $5. We had the popcorn shrimp tempura, edamame hummus (it was incredible), tuna tataki, spicy tuna roll, and several drinks. It was totally affordable!

They also told us about this Stimulus Menu. It's like $30 a person and you get your choice of appetizer, entrée and dessert. Which I think is a great deal. You would spend wayyyy more than that on a regular dinner. So next time we go I'm trying that for sure!"}
{"text":"It's on the 3rd floor of the Forum shops, a little stuffy and haughty, but what can you expect?  We popped in for lunch, around 1:30pm.  If you like attentive service, that would be the perfect time to go.  There were exactly 4 other customers in the restaurant...despite the few customers, there was a hostess, a waiter, a water guy, an appetizer/plate clearing guy, 2 sushi chefs, and a manager.  No wonder a vegetarian roll is $14!  Great view of the strip from the booths, and the decor was modern, comfortable and elegant  (think low backed leather couches and natural materials).  My sweetie and I had the Chef's sushi combo, a Harvest roll (skip it), and the spicy tuna roll.  All of the fish was like butter (yellowtail, salmon, tuna, shrimp).  Really fresh, better than some I've had here at home on the the west coast.  I had a cocktail called the Tokyo Cooler--a very delicious, refreshing, dangerous cocktail.  I could have gotten prom-night drunk on those, no prob.  Rolls were $13-26  (approx 4 pieces)each, sashimi $13-24 for 4 pieces.  Handrolls $6.  All in all we spent $55 on lunch.  We were satiated--not overly so--I wanted to save room for gelatto."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but slow service.  I was not impressed enough to return based on the other sushi restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a date night last night so we decided to check this place out. As first timers we came away impressed with the overall experience. The food was very good, the service was excellent. Our server CJ was fantastic. He was super friendly and informed. He made some excellent recommendations, including the oysters with a lime wasabi type dressing, so good! The blue fin belly was very good and fresh as well.  There wasn't anything we ordered that wasn't good. I'm not sure sushi snobs would be blown away by this place, but we will definitely be back. I would say this place makes our top 5 for sushi in the valley. I would give Sushi Roku 4.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! We went around 9:30 on a Friday night b/c that was all they had available, but I didn't mind since I had been dying to try it. My favorites:
- Yellowtail Sashami with Chilis - light and so good.
- Organic Garden Salad - almost too pretty to eat with all the vegetable curls, but of course I did and it was delicious.
- Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus - SO YUMMY!!! Had a delicious glaze/sauce to go with it.
- Hanabi Spicy Tuna on Rice Cakes - MY FAVORITE!!! Recommended by our server and I was hesitant but the spicy tuna and the crispy rice cake go so perfect together.
- Chilean Sea Bass - YUM!!! I had gotten this to-go a few times after seeing it featured in Phoenix magazine, but was even better straight from the kitchen.

I also had some sort of specialty margarita that was so good and went perfectly with the food. Our server was AWESOME and the decor was beautiful (we sat in a booth near the sushi bar). Prices were in line with what we spent at Geisha House, which I thought was quite reasonable for a high-end sushi restaurant. Definitely the night out we were hoping for and we will be back."}
{"text":"Went into Roku knowing nothing about sushi, and now I feel like I know everything thanks to our server. The food was all such great quality. Also I didn't even have to order our server picked everything for us! Also had a bottle of sake I've never had before which I am now in love with. Again thanks to the server. His name was Jon and he was very professional, knowledgable, and yet still super causal with us! Thanks again Jon I'll be asking for him again."}
{"text":"Todd, you were right. This place is like a nightclub with sushi. Just really expensive and really tan people friendly. Meaning-fake tans, over priced, underwhelming.  Service was fine. Seriously. Meh"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! After looking at the prices, the table decided to get the tasting menu, because as it was rather well priced in comparison. We were all SO glad we did. I now have so much more of an appreciation for the art form that sushi and all of Japanese food. Flavor combinations that I NEVER would have thought of were simply magic. I just wish there was more of it! 

Service was also wonderful. I love hot sake, but haven't had much experience with cold. She recommended first a sampler to pair with our courses. Wonderful! 

Pair that with a fabulous view of the strip and you have an unforgettable experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal! We did the \"family style\" dining where the waiter brought out a variety of dishes. Everything was amazing. The only downside of doing it that way was the cost but it was worth it. A must try for sushi when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Had dinner and service was a little slow BUT justen with an \"e\" had jumped and saved the night by getting the service jumping and he made up for it with great service. Food is excellent too"}
{"text":"Great food and had an incredible waitress named Nicole. She gave solid recommendations on the food and was a very down to earth person. I will definitely come back to this establishment!"}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I went into Roku (where we haven't gone in quite some time) and had a great experience. We travel a lot during the summer so we do not get a lot of time to go to our favorite spots. Roku is one of them and it was unreal. Jon served us a complex order and gave us some great recommendations that my wife loved! Happy wife is happy life! Thank you to Roku and the staff"}
{"text":"Made the long trip to Scottsdale from Goodyear to check out Sushi Roku and to celebrate our friend's birthday. Beautiful atmosphere and tasty sushi made this a nice experience. I wouldn't say it's the best sushi I've had, but well worth the visit. Our only complaint would be the 45+ minutes we waited for our check after completing our meal. Granted, it was Saturday night and the place was fairly busy, but come on...

After we FINALLY got our bill...gulp....the prices are very high...we ventured upstairs to the open air lounge which is nestled near the W hotel's pool, which I've heard is an experience all in it's self. Lounge was small and a little noisy for us 30+ yr olds...LOL! 

Nice experience...would return again."}
{"text":"One of the Killers', and especially singer Brandon Flowers', favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. If you want to spot celebrities anywhere, this is the place. Oh right, and the sushi is insanely good too...

From LV's Daily Fiaso blog: \"Even family man Brandon Flowers has to eat. Thus we have him being spotted enjoying lunch at Sushi Roku inside the Forum Shops at Caesars today with family in tow. Reportedly, the singer is a frequent visitor of the acclaimed restaurant.\"

{"text":"A perennial guest at the W Hotel this is the only dining option... Consistently disappointed in the lack of attentive service / food and beverage wait times. The focus on the \"scene/crowd\" overshadows all else and is definitely not accommodating to the solo female business exec based on my experience at the bar/high top section.  Recipe for satisfaction = (- expectations + patience + sugar daddy)"}
{"text":"WE LOVE SUSHI ROKU IN SCOTTSDALE!!! We moved to Phoenix 2 years ago and frequented the other locations in CA.....sushi ROKU in Scottsdale is THE BEST! Chef Miles omakase....which we've had numerous times....is not only a culinary adventure but creative, unique and beyond delicious. We crave it. The staff is great and the management always says hello and greets customers. This is a place you will want to come to again and again. We've had sushi from Japan to New York and in between....sushi roku in Scottsdale stands out. Thanks to Miles, the staff and management who do a fantastic job.....each and every single time!.......
......from C and F"}
{"text":"Great, especially better at the happy hour. Been here several times before, and we love it each time. Pricey, but good. Ambiance was great, and great location, you can shop after too work off the calories. Spicy tuna as usual was the bomb, juts enough flavor not too greasy. Volcano dessert was awesome."}
{"text":"What a bad time! We had reservations for 930 and didn't get seated until 10...well we got seated at a temporary table until the table we were supposed to have was ready...then we moved again! They didn't get ANY of the food right! Some of us didn't eat at all. We all left hungry. My ribs were good but fatty..not worth $20. I will not be returning. One star for decor."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. Was a little disappointed in the service and food. The restaurant is connected to the W Hotel in Scottsdale, great location. The interior of the restaurant is really nice and modern. As for the service, the waitress took about 15 minutes to come by the table to get our drink order. Once she did, it took another 10 minutes for us to get our drinks. We then ordered the food. She brought out the first order of suchi and had forgotten to bring our edamame for our appetizer. We then asked her for it. Then she brought out another dish and forgot half of it. We then sat for another 15 minutes before any other food came out. I asked the waitress what was taking so long (since there was only 2 others tables in the entire restaurant), she said that everyone was ordering sushi and they were busy. That wasn't the brightest response because 1 we are at a sushi restaurant, so of course people will be ordering sushi, 2 she only had 3 tables to wait on. Once we did get our sushi, the rolls fell a apart. So it just seemed as though everything was just not up to par, especially for the amount of money you pay. 

As for the food itself, we had the following:

Spicy Tuna hand roll
Softshell Crab Roll
Rock Shrimp Jalapeno Roll
Cucumber Roll
Kobe Skewer

The food itself wasn't bad, it was more of the experience that wasn't great."}
{"text":"Right when you walk in, this place was pretty nice.  We made reservations at 8pm and everything looked amazing.  They had these booths on the right hand side which looked pretty comfortable, but we had a large group so we took a table.  The decor is really relaxing and the view is awesome.  
I had the salmon and scallop dish here and it was really good.  Everything in the dish went with each other, but I didn't order much because we were going out later that night...drinking...so yeah.  I guess I'd say that this place met my expectations and didn't disappoint.  Service was on par with the status of the restaurant so no complaints there.  But for some reason I couldn't give this place 5 stars.  The food was good but not excellent...if it was excellent I would have ordered more after my first dish.  
Overall, I'm satisfied with my experience here."}
{"text":"A gem in Vegas! The staff was very knowledgable on the fish and where it came from. We had the chef make a roll of his choice and it was spectacular!!! The king crab sashimi was incredible!! Will be back to this place again! Cocktails were A+!!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant!  Atmosphere, service, and cuisine are top notch! The views of the Strip always contribute to a great dining experience. I recommend the asparagus wrapped in filet mignon as an appetizer. The tofu steak entree is also a fine compliment to any main course. My ginger lychee mojito was fabulous and I suggest you order one or several with your meal. Sushi Roku strives for excellence and always delivers it!  Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!!!!!!!

{"text":"The service was decent however the food was horrible. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday the sushi was so fishy he couldn't even eat it. I got a California roll it was soggy and poorly prepared. We have had better sushi from Fry's supermarket I am giving one star for the birthday ice cream dessert."}
{"text":"Unreasonably pricey. Crazy service fee. We weren't been clearly explained about the 20% fee in the bill. We had sashimi, wagyu beef, tempura, sushi and ended up paying $1500+ for a party of 9, plus a hard $300 service fee, which is crazy because we only ordered platters to share. The waitress was busy and we had to call on her a few times to order things. Not the best service around town but charging too high. Don't go there!"}
{"text":"Sushi R does it again. A buddy of mine hooked me up with this place 7 yrs ago and it's ever bit as good today as 7 yrs ago - do yourself a favor and eat at Sushi Roku 
Katana Roll is a std and try the Sea Bass Roboto as a starter kit!"}
{"text":"This was our second Thanksgiving dinner here (weird, I know).  We came back because the food is good and the decor is nice for a dress-up family dinner.  I'm from Hawaii, so my standards for raw fish are high (which explains the lower rating for some of the sushi items). 

Spicy tuna roll w/ avocado: 3 (boring)
Hottate (scallop sashimi): 4
Ikura (salmon roe): 4
Oysters: 4
Tofu 3 Ways: 5 (served with truffles, caviar, and ginger with delicious sauces and red dipping salt)
Miso eggplant: 5 (so good!)
Shishito peppers: 5
Tuna tartare: 4.5

Service was a-ok, no problems."}
{"text":"This was for my girlfriend's 30th birthday and she loves sushi so I wanted to treat her to a place that is nice. As we approached the front entrance of Sushi Roku, we were greeted by two skinny cold looking hosts. As one of them escorted us to the table, she nonchalantly asked how I was doing but it wasn't very sincere. She seated us right in front where we can see ... the outside to the mall. I caught a quick glimpse of the darker area of the restaurant that supposedly have a great view of the strip lit up.

Needless to say, at least our server was nice. I told him we had a show to catch (Peep Show) and the order came out very quickly. We ordered:

- Foie Gras wrapped in Yellow tail sashimi (foie gras was over powering and salty)
- Toro (don't remember what it even tastes like, not impressed)
- Japanese Yellow Tail Sashimi with Diced Chiles (too salty)
- Chilean Seabass w/Yuzu butter (this was a flavorful dish. The bass was very well cooked)
- Kobe Beef Skewers w/ Black Pepper Sauce (flavorful and tender; thumbs up)
- Spicy Tuna and Rainbow Roll (rolls were pretty good size and tasted fresh)

Total for 2 people: $216 including 1 mojito and 1 cocktail

Would I go back? Only if I get a chance to have a nice view of the strip at night but besides that, not really."}

Food: Wide vareity, fresh fish in the middle of desert .

{"text":"Went to the LV location instead of the one in Santa Monica.  This is next to the BOA steakhouse in the ceasar's forum shops.  We ate here to celebrate my sister's birthday.  We didn't make any reservations ahead of time, but they were able to accomodate eight girls and were given a good table with a view of the strip  We ordered different kinds of sushi, salmon terriyaki, to soba noodles.  We each thought our dishes were pretty good.  They even provided my sister with a bday dessert."}
{"text":"Very impressed, 
hands down one of the best restaurants in the area.  The menu was unbelievable and the service was even better.  The food was diverse and amazing, it was some sort of experience that combined the art of the culinary past mixed with the present. The freshness of everything is where I was most surprised being that this particular location is in AZ. I can confidently say it's one of the top sushi restaurants I have ever visited and will be going back for more."}
{"text":"Sat at the sushi bar with Kyle and ordered omikase. He did a phenomenal job selecting cuts of traditional and exotic sashimi tailored specifically to the taste preferences of my girlfriend and I.  Very thorough explanation of each plate. Extremely attentive and friendly. Had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Went here during a visit to Vegas. Debated the oh-toro (fatty tuna) out loud and even our server commented that it was great and \"just melts in your mouth\". Ended up ordering 2 orders (4 pieces) of it along with our entrees.

The tuna we had looked like they were less than ideal cuts. Not only did they taste bad, they were likely the worst tuna I've ever had. A complaint to our server simply resulted in her shaking her head and saying \"not so good?\" with no offer of a remedy.

Two stars because the fried rice was pretty good."}
{"text":"The hubby and I went here for our anniversary and everything was spectacular! Everything we had was amazingly fresh but the highlights of the meal were the tuna carpaccio, the yellowtail with diced chilies and the ribeye wrapped asparagus. We could have licked the plates. Such attentive staff and great atmosphere. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sushi is so great at this resturant I love they roll so fresh and it's so good 
Great service and everyone friendly there."}

{"text":"Tuna Carpaccio and tuna tataki sushi was fresh and delicious! Celebrated a birthday here! Friendly wait staff and sushi chef! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"As a purveyor of all food fine, my wife and I ate here this past Friday night.  The serviec was friendly and not stuffy.  Our server Louis was great, very knowledgeable on the menu and a fellow foodie.  

The decor was very hip and the Strip view from the main dining room were amazing.  We sat at the large couch-like tables and seating area, which are the best seats in the house.  

We ordered the spicy tuna on cripsy rice, which was very good.  The jalepenos were diced and mixed into the tuna which was much better than most places that just place a sliver of the jalepeno on the rice.  Very tasty.  We also ordered the peppered kobi beef skewers which were tender and flavorful. Perfectly grilled.  

We also ordered the baked crab handroll...which were the best we've ever eaten and we've had the ones at Katsuya and Koi. These by far were the best as the crab was flavorful and was stuffed in there...unlike Katsuya where they have the tendency to skimp on the ingredients.

The best part of the night was the chilean sea bass with miso glaze. That fish was cooked to perfection, it was light, flaky and ever so sweet.

This place rocks!"}
{"text":"It was a nice surprise when we found out that they have lunch special! Bento box with teriyaki salmon and 4 pieces of sashimi priced at $19, super delicious! My friend ordered unagi donburi and it was to die for, sweet and melt in your mouth eel! Service was excellent! I recommend to go during lunch time if you come to town with kids, it was nice, quite and still great food and service!"}
{"text":"I have an iron stomach and the sushi I had here put some chinks in it.  Obviously something wasn't fresh.

The service was good.
The Toro Sashimi wasn't good due to the stringiness of the fish.  It's supposed to melt in your mouth and be the best.  So disappointing.
The tempura and edamame was really good.
The rolls were good but I can't remember which one.

Next time I'll be going to BOA instead."}
{"text":"Came here and got the seafood udon noodle dish. It's not in the menu but recommended because I asked if I could add meat to the udon noodle. The server was great - the Brussels sprouts chip were great. Next time I go to Vegas I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I love this place. Very friendly inviting staff, the ambiance is great and u have a view of the strip. The sushi is fresh and always good as well as the choice of sake."}
{"text":"We are regulars whenever we visit Las Vegas. The service here is excellent, and the food quality is second to none ! The Manager, Johnny, is very accommodating, and makes sure everything is perfect. The yellowtail with diced chillies is one of our favorites, all seafood is the freshest you can get. The hot appetizers are consistently excellent as well. Tempura is great, too. The atmosphere is very friendly and upbeat. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that is looking for a great japanese meal, with a great view of the strip. Don't miss out on this rare treat !!"}
{"text":"I rate this place 2 stars because the calamari was dressed with this sauce that they did not even ask if you want it and the sushi was alright the rainbow roll the salmon and all the fish were not fresh that's all I gotta say very dissatisfied and disappointed"}
{"text":"My wife and I just had dinner at Sushi Roku, and we really enjoyed it. The service was terrific, especially our server, Deborah. The ingredients were fresh, the warm dishes were straight from the kitchen, and the portions were adequate. Highlights included the Lobster Tempura with a Miso Glaze and the Kobe Beef Pot Stickers. The sushi was terrific, too. We had plenty to eat, and two cocktails each, for about $150, plus tip.would dine here again, for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place hands down. The tuna role is great along with the crab roll as well. Beautiful view of the strip if u sit by the window. Excellent staff."}
{"text":"We came for happy hour... Planned to stay for dinner but after we realized it would take 20 minutes for someone to greet us and to get the appetizer we decided to head to another sushi place for the main course. There are far better sushi restaurants in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The staff was not very friendly, we kept having to ask for our stuff we ordered a couple of times to wait staff. The green tea was burnt so it was very bitter. The Sashimi pieces still had skin on them so eating them was not a great texture. I had one piece It was so fishy I almost threw up in my mouth. The brussel sprouts where not very tasty and greasy. The Korean bbq short ribs were so salty we couldn't eat it. They wouldn't split the bill so it made it a long difficult process for us to figure things out. The price is very expensive for service and quality. I get better service and sushi from hole in the walls. The only good thing we had was the oysters so that's why they get 1 star."}
{"text":"Ordered $35 executive Bento box, food is well prepared  with quality ingredients, I won't say it is a bargain as lunch special but I am not disappointed either."}
{"text":"OK, Sushi Roku has, in my opinon the best sushi in the Valley. It was ridiculous. Loved it. I went for happy hour and it was pretty quiet but I wasn't expecting it to be bumpin'. As a matter of fact I was hoping to avoid the snobs and I guess I did. (I hear they show up after 9 pm, FYI). I sat at the bar, enjoyed the edamame hummus and the spicy tuna rolls. The spicy tuna rolls were seriously the best. The service rocked too. Our bartender took great care of us. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh sushi! Got the spicy tuna roll and absolutely loving it! The sashimi is a bit pricey, but everything is very well done. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The best restaurant for sushi in Vegas!!!!!!! Love this place and the View of the strip is fabulous. They have great filet also that has a great garlic butter soy sauce and saki mixed drinks. The staff is wonderful and that has a lot to do with the  management there since (Johnny) is by far the best manager making sure that everything is perfect:)"}
{"text":"Not what you would expect from being inside a shopping center - Nice!
Sushi and Sashimi were good, sides and extras were fresh. Service was very friendly and attentive, pricing was - well, typical for the Strip.
All in all, good restaurant, great ambiance and quality service."}
{"text":"WOW! 

That's the only way that I can describe my experience at Sushi Roku last week.

My parents were in town and I wanted to show them an amazing night and I can honestly say that they left blown away by our experience here. Neither of them are major sushi fans so to win them over is no easy task, they are already talking about making it a tradition to eat here.

From the minute we walked in the door we were treated as royalty, being greeted by the manager (Mike Kirsch) from the get go is a refreshing change of pace, he assured us that if we needed anything we would be taken care of. Mike checked in multiple times throughout the night to make sure everything we needed was being addressed and of course, it was! 

From the second I exited my uber to the minute I walked out the door we felt special, which is not typically a feeling I have when exiting a restaurant but this place is truly amazing.

I'll be back soon! Mike Kirsch and our server were off the charts, I need to get that mans work schedule because anytime he's there you are sure to have a world class experience.

Thanks to everyone at Sushi Roku in Scottsdale for an incredible night!"}
{"text":"Im not one to write reviews. However, the staff, the service & food at Sushi Roku was excellent. And far exceeded my expectation. First off, Stephen Dean coordinated a party of 14 for my daughters prom. He was professional, super accommodating and very nice. His turn around time for responding to emails was extremely prompt.  He created a perfect menu that all the kids would like. And made sure everyone had plenty to eat. Lastly, the service was impeccable and funny. As parents, we all know kids eating at restaurants don't usually get great service unless their parents are at the table. My daughter (who frequently dines out) said it was the best service her and her friends have ever had. The service was quick and they were well attended to. Not to mention the food was excellent. A big thank you goes out to everyone involved in making my daughters prom memorable!"}
{"text":"Sushi Roku is kind of inside of the W hotel ... so you can imagine that the place is certainly is very nice in term of atmosphere or deco ... love the style of this place. 

Went there for a Saturday lunch with only few people around and enjoyed the seating outside with such great weather, so the overall ambient was totally 5 stars.   I will check it out again at night and see how the scene likes ... 

As for the food, me and my friend shared two of the lunch bento boxes with a variety of food from miso soup, salad, tempura, teriyaki, sushi to roll and dessert (green tea and red bean ice-cream)... Food was ok, not a whole lot to rave about. But again, this type of restaurant, you go there more for the atmosphere than food.  So in that sense, it met my expectation. 

Will recommend this place for a night-out, or date place"}
{"text":"This place has been reviewed enough that I really can't add anything more.  Good food although the hot stuff especially the beef wrapped asparagus things were better than anything raw.  I don't think I'm going to be invited back.  I started doing saki bombs...I know weird when's it's just two people and I kept getting the shot glass stuck somehow in the beer glass.  The waitress was going nuts I could see the sushi chef giving me a stink eye...big mess.  In fairness to them I don't think it was the glasses but somehow I was dropping them wrong in my drunken state.  My apologies so I'm giving them an extra star.  I am sure they know who I am from this review.  I apologize deeply."}
{"text":"The sushi bar here just rock.  Second and third visit to  Sushi Roku, P made a bee line for the sushi bar.  That made all the difference.  

First time here we sat at a booth and while the food was good, there wasn't anything to make me want to go out of my way to come back.

But the sushi bar just transform the experience.  The sushi chefs are friendly and willing to engage you and what's fresh and good.   I put my trust and their recommendation and left happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"First of all we missed our reservation time due to Hennessey. Worried that we may not be able to move to a later time, I was pleasantly surprised to receive a later reservation. So of course our party still showed up late to the restaurant still in thanks to said Hennessey. The staff still managed to be very friendly despite our lack of grace and composure (aka Bachelor Party).  In fact they locked us in the private room with an equally crazy Bachelor Party also from our hometown (Go Niners).

The food itself was good. I had the Crab Dynamite Roll, the Spicy Scallop roll and the Crispy Salmon dinner. None of the above stuck out specifically but the quality and presentation are enjoyable. Drinks blurred into Sake Bombs and shots of Patron. The check was a bit rough but I felt it matched my expectations well.  My overall star rating is 3.5"}
{"text":"For our last night in Vegas, we were looking to do a show and a fancier dinner. And a show and a fancier dinner we did! Our first choice for dinner was booked out a month, so we fell back on our trusty old friend, sushi. This restaurant did not disappoint. My boyfriend made a reservation (just to be safe). We get there and we are promptly seated in the back room; the windows behind our table looked out over the strip. Everything was prompt - the service and the time frame in between ordering our drinks and food and those getting to the table. Not to mention the service was so friendly - for some reason, they speak in rather quiet tones, which normally would frustrate me (I'm mostly deaf) but for some reason, it contributed more to the already soothing atmosphere. It was very intimate and peaceful. My boyfriend got some sashimi, soup, and rolls (forget what, exactly) while I got a little bowl of rice and rolls. The food was great! Normally, I'd go into much more detail, but I'll just leave it at that and let you find out how good it is. Dessert (mochi) was also good, three flavors of your choosing and one piece (which is then halved) of each flavor. I appreciated this, so I could indulge my sweet tooth but not feel overwhelmed/too full from it. Overall, this is a romantic and peaceful restaurant, equally good for couples as well as groups. We went early (6 PM) so this probably helped out with the peacefulness a lot, but nonetheless, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"If you like authentic sushi (i.e. not crazy rolls where you can't taste the freshness of the fish), sit at the sushi bar and let the chef know. He'll hook you up with some out of the world food that you won't forget. They have the best selection of fish in town and amazing variety of condiments from Japan, including fresh wasabi root that's grated to order."}
{"text":"i made reservations for vday here they took my CC down to hold the reservation. then afterwards i realized they were a chain so i was hesitant to go through with it but seeing as how they were gonna charge me $25/pp i kept the booking. and IT WAS WORTH IT! the service was good but the meal was better!! had AMAZING yellowtail sashimi appetizer with scallion and ponzu sauce, then we did a Katana roll and added cream cheese to it (i know, how fraudulent) and then my bf and i shared the RibEye cooked to the most perfect medium i've ever had. everything was delicious! i admit a bit pricey but it was vegas and valentine's day so we let it go. a great view of the strip and really nice place. the only thing was the seat cushions we sat on had little room to spare between us and the table so if youre a bigger person or have big thighs then..id steer clear of those booths."}
{"text":"If I were to rate Roku on the quality of the food, it would be much higher. However, they not only have a very limited sushi menu, but it is also OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced while at the same time offering tiny portions. 

I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love sushi, it is my favorite food so I am always hoping to find a good sushi restaurant when I go to Vegas. This place was okay. I think I am just too spoilt going to Sushi Deli in San Diego which is hands down the best sushi place on earth. The sushi here was just okay to me. I got the black truffle roll because it sounded awesome and someone else suggested it on here. It tasted like absolutely nothing to me. It wasn't bad, it just tasted like crunchy cardboard. We also accidentally ordered cold sake which is quite possibly one of the grossest tasting things you could ever drink. Overall the sushi was fine, but I wouldn't come here again to be completely honest."}
{"text":"I had some sushi. I had some sake. I had something with black truffle. Oh yeah, I had some seaweed salad too. Let me tell you, everything was delicious. That's all."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place. Fun, exciting, and beautiful. Great for a romantic dinner, nice dinner meeting for business, or getting some food before a night on the town. Our server Sarah was wonderful. Helped us order things we would not have ordered ourselves but knocked our socks off. Her food and beverage knowledge left us wanting for naught. Come in, ask for Sarah, let her take you on a magical culinary adventure as she says. You will not regret it in the least."}
{"text":"I recently took my wife to Sushi Roku for a long overdue night out. Several friends highly recommended this restaurant not only for great food, but for its outstanding customer service as well. Although the bar was set high from the outset, both my wife and I could not have had a better experience.

We were not that familiar with Sushi, or many other items on the menu. Fortunately, our server Nicole, did an unbelievable job in clearly explaining everything to us and even made perfect recommendations that made our dining experience top notch. It was almost like she knew exactly what our taste buds would prefer. 

No more long delays in taking my wife for a romantic night out.    Sushi Roku is now a scheduled weekly destination.  I'll be sure to ask for Nicole as our server.  So nice when your server is as helpful and pleasant as her. 

I'd recommend Sushi Roku in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"If I am in the Old Town area of Scottsdale mid-day, this is my go-to lunch spot. It's never loud at lunch and the atmosphere is totally different from a dinner service there, far more tranquil. It is a place I meet clients for lunch frequently because it is never louder than a dull roar.  

For lunch, get one of their Custom Bento Boxes. In the bento box you get to pick two options I get mine with Chicken Kara-age (which I think tastes somewhat like KFC, minus their extra grease) and sashimi which is six pieces consisting of two of each of the following fish, yellowtail, salmon and tuna. One day they were out of regular tuna sashimi and they had to give me fatty tuna (Toro), what a fantastic mistake that was for me and my happy tummy.

I think I read someones review that called the place a \"hipster hangout\" I've never heard a more inaccurate statement made about this particular establishment. Hipsters like PBR and indie music, all they will get at Sushi Roku is a Sapporo and some fantastic yellowtail. I would call this place \"hip\" though, the decor is very intimate and interesting, especially at night and they do a very good job of being trendy which of course attracts the people that want to be \"seen\". What I mean is Hipster, no. Beautiful people and wanabees, yes. Having said that, I do not think there is a restaurant I have ever seen more actual celebrities at in Scottsdale than this one, recent spottings include Kristen Schaal and Rainn Wilson.  

For dinner appetizers you can't go wrong with the yellowtail with diced chiles or the hanabi. For mains you can do the \"omakase\" at the sushi bar if you've got the deep pockets and adventurous appetite or just stick with the ribeye with Japonais sauce which is an umami overload!"}
{"text":"I always hit up my favorite sushi joint when I'm in Vegas.  The fish is so fresh and yummy"}
{"text":"Food was of the chain good. Couldn't give it 5 stars cause of the price and water tasted like hose water when I was a kid."}
{"text":"This place is amazing I was out here in Vegas in June for my 27th birthday. My aunt and uncle brought me here, considering my aunt is not a sushi eater, so my uncle had a sushi partner lol. Omg.....delicious. amazing. Even the saki was really good except I requested it be chilled. And it was on the sweeter more milder side. People the host there was as fabulous as they get. He was such a diva lol! Ok! Now back to the food. My aunt from what I recall ordered a filet that she loved and my uncle and I chowed down on all kinds of sushi. It was amazing. Wish I lived closer lol! Xoxo"}
{"text":"Sitting at the sushi bar here is the best. The two times I've been here, they've had a good variety of fresh fish here, more than what I've found at other sushi places around town. Finally I've found my amberjack sashimi!!!
If you're looking for some great selection of fresh sashimi, come here!"}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere, stunning view, the staff is ultra friendly and helpful, and they'll do a huge portion of their menu gluten free!! This the first time ever that I have been able to order gluten free spicy tuna.  Also their sashimi is melt in your mouth good!"}
{"text":"Sushi Roku was a great experience. We were seated and served so quickly. We had an 8 o clock friday night dinner reservation and although they were quite busy, many members of the staff made sure to take care of us. Highly recommend the cocktails and the makoto roll, so yummy. They also brought out a huge sparkler and decorated plate of desert for my boyfriend, as we were celebrating hid birthday."}
{"text":"The view was nice! Food was okay. Spicy tuna hand roll had too much rice. Overall awesome atmosphere and great service!"}
{"text":"Excel price, food, services during happy hour.
I ordered miso eggplant, stuffed chicken in mushroom, rock shrimp tempura hand roll, albacore sashimi with fried onion, spicy yellowtail cut roll. The bartender made lychee martini and charge only  $5. The bill came $30, I paid $36total. You can't beat the service, food and price elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good food, very overpriced because of location and the view. Servers were knowledgeable but had an air of pretentiousness. I had the 6 piece chef choice, 2 pc bluefin, uni and spicy tuna rolls. All good, but much better AYCE places for $60 for two exist in the valley. But if you are in the Ceasar's shopping this is a good sushi spot. 4/5"}
{"text":"I made reservations on Opentable a month or more in advance and we still got a table basically in the mall.  We watched other people that had put their name on the list and waited get seated by the window and the view.
Strike 1.

Service SUCKED.  The waitress actually didnt talk.  She would walk up to the table and look at us and wait for us to talk.. She would walk by and we would say excuse me and she would clearly hear us and keep walking.  She never checked on us once during the meal and believe me her tip showed how unhappy we were.
Strike 2.

We ordered a sampling of items.. we had The shrimp dim sum, which was the best item we ordered.  Does anyone else think thats funny?  The best item was a chinese dish.. haha

We ordered chicken yakitori which was pretty good but kind of overly yuzu'd up.   Way too overpowering on some bites.

We ordered a scallop dynamite which was ok, again overpowered by a flavor, which this time was the bonita flakes on top.  And halfway through eating it you could see oil puddling at the bottom of the dish, signaling we should be done and we were.

Last and least we ordered the Spicy Tuna crunchy roll (or something to that effect)  It was undercooked on the tempura outside, yet somehow overcooked on the Tuna inside.  Once this got a little cold it was disgusting...
Strike 3.

Price is outrageous really for the quality of food and quality of service.  It showed us that they really dont care if or when we come back and we wont.
Strike OUT."}
{"text":"Im rarely disappointed.. But this placed sucks! Took forever for my food to arrive even though its about 25% full. And the rolls are tiny!! Im leaving and im still hungry! :("}
{"text":"Had great service, food was amazing, and Jon was more than informative for an inexperienced first timer. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I've eaten at  both the Los Angeles and Pasadena, CA location. The Scottsdale location did not disappoint!  The decor here was nicer than the other locations, still rocking that chic and hip vibe that the W hotel and roku restaurants always have. We came with a large group of people, so we ordered a ton of dishes. Here are some highlights and must haves:
1) yellow tail with diced green chile: paper thin slices of hamachi bathed in a yuzu sauce topped with tiny pieces of diced green and red chile. It was delicious as always!
2) spicy tuna on crispy rice: i always order this at every establishment that offers it on the menu and I find that roku does it the best. The rice it's served on is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and comes out warm. It's piled on high with spicy tuna that's bursting with flavor and heat. 
3) miso marinated cod: this is another dish I always order when it's available. It's not as good as Nobu Matsuhisa's, but still delicious. The fish is so delicate, it flakes apart easily with a fork and melts in your mouth releasing the flavors and sweetness of both the fish and miso marinade. Absolutely delicious!
4) Chilean sea bass: this is another really delicate fish that had great flavor and served nicely seasoned sautéd spinach. 
5) crunchy spicy tuna and avocado roll: tuna and avocado with tempura flake crust
6) spicy tuna and shrimp in rice paper roll (I forget the actual name of it): the rice paper gives this roll a unique and delicious flavor. 
7) rock shrimp: tempura style mixed with a sweet sauce.  
8) mixed seafood tempura: the batter was light and flaky. The scallop and asparagus were my favorites. 
9) edamame (soybeans): made al dente and came out steaming hot to our table lightly salted. Delicious! 

Everything here from the service to the food to the ambience is great. This place rocks!!"}
{"text":"This is the sushi restaurant to come to if you want to overpay and feel like an unwelcomed guest.

My girlfriend and I were in a hurry so we stopped by here without a reservation on a Saturday night. Three (!) hostesses (no idea why they needed that many since none of them were doing anything) at the stand rudely told us all we could sit at would be the sushi bar even though we saw many open tables. I did not complain and happily accepted that. Big mistake.

We were jammed into two spots at the tight sushi bar and given a drink list. After waiting about 10 minutes for someone to take our drink bar, the sushi chef impatiently asked if we were ready. Um, no menus yet. He yelled at a server who came by and apologized and gave us menus and took our drink orders. Ok, honest mistake we thought...

Drinks came back and we ordered edamame and our sushi. Edamame never came and we couldn't get our server back until after we ate our rolls, which did come out quick. 

I complimented our sushi chef on the rainbow roll and he barely grunted back at me. Meanwhile, the chef to our left was having a very long conversation with the couple next to us. Maybe we got a grumpy chef? Either way, the rolls were good but I felt as if I had done something to piss off the staff which I felt to be pretty impossible since we had barely even got anyone to talk to us and I had been nothing but polite and complimentary.

When asked about the edamame, server just smacked his head and said sorry. He was nice enough but apparently overworked or not prepared to handle weekend volume. Either way, pretty poor from what I expected to be some of the best sushi on the strip.

Bill came to $70 for 3 rolls, salmon sashimi and a soft drink or two. Couldn't wait to get out of here. Food was good but I'd rather have my money back. This is the worst side of Vegas: overpriced, rude service, and no one pushing the staff to do better."}
{"text":"Great view of the strip. The sushi here is good. You will end up spending around $80 (inc. tip) for 2 for an appetizer and 3 different types of sushi/sashimi (average priced ones). The service was great/quick however they were not busy at the time we ate."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I don't eat a bunch of crazy stuff lol but my boyfriend does. We went for a birthday dinner their. They ordered sea urchin with quail egg, beautiful blue fin tuna, pig ear with cartilage lol, raw beef liver with garlic. Everyone loved the food. I didn't. Try any of that but I did get the tofu and that was really good! It's definitely something to check out!"}
{"text":"warning! biased opinion here. 
get to know the chefs. once they get to know you, you're experience will be stellar! first, i dont eat rolls! second i've been to japan numerous times and have had sushi there. third. i know where sushi roku is located (arizona) for those who forget. fourth i make a reservation any time im having dinner there. that said, have the grace and faith to let the chef make you what he would eat or what he thinks would best suit your tastes. (be honest! if you dont like uni say so!!!, if you normally eat rolls try omakese at your local sushi spot befor trying it here!! ) the chefs here have a strong head chef that teaches not just cutting techniques for the numerous fish that other sushi bars nearby dont carry, but also about how to best \"service' the guest. 
if your expecting super fast rolls and unrealistic low cost, you made the wrong decision."}
{"text":"Good food. Make sure you are early for your reservation there is no grace period if you are late.

If you want water and the waiter offers you flat or sparkling water, it's bottled water and you will be charged it's not complimentary. 

Good atmosphere"}
{"text":"Back at Roku and YES!!! Amazing once again.  Must have is the Grilled Octopus!  And the smoked Albacore is a treat....  not to mention how amazing the service is ... say hello to Dustin behind the bar, he's the best, or ask for Bre... she will make your dining experience one you will want to yelp. 5 stars.  Fantastic food, fantastic service, fantastic staff.....  well done Dan."}
{"text":"I rarely give places a five star. A five star place is the perfect model which all other places aspire to be. Sushi Roku is that place.

Obviously the top criterion for any sushi place is the quality of the fish. It tasted fresh--and I mean out of the ocean fresh! I still am having a hard time trying to get my head wrapped around the fact that Las Vegas is nowhere near an ocean and yet it was the freshest sushi I ever had.

With that out of the way, the service was impeccable. More than one person had their eye on me to see if I wanted anything else. What I was impressed by was that they balanced the way to be immediately responsive without being too imposing. All I had to do was make eye contact with one of the restaurant staff anywhere and they seemed to master communication by gesture among the staff so the right person could address whatever it is i was looking for.

Finally, what is a sushi place without a master sushi chef? This guy was good. I even asked if they had things that were not on the menu and he still produced them in less than three minutes.

Granted I did drop 80 dollars by myself here, but with this kind of service and this kind of food, I find it is worth the money.

If you are in Vegas, and you really like sushi, there is no excuse not to go here."}
{"text":"Incredibly fresh sushi and very friendly staff. Sit at the sushi bar for the full experience. AREGATO!!!"}
{"text":"We loved sushi roku in the W! Rio was an amazing server, Dan and Steve were so fun....thanks to that trio we enjoyed delicious sushi and blanc de blue and will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by a local at our hotel. Ambiance was great. Service was great. Food not so much. A coworker and I were there Saturday evening. We took suggestions from the chefs menu that day, an appetizer recommended by the waitress, sashimi, and then some rolls. Maybe we didn't order the right items but nothing seemed fresh. Really disappointed because I had high expectations going in."}
{"text":"My friends were in the mood for rolls, so we ended up here after wandering around the Forum shops trying to beat the heat.  I opted for the 3 course prix fixe for $45.  Appetizers were very good - glazed chicken, salmon with truffles, and kobe beef skewers.  Sushi plate was ok but nothing special, and dessert was a simple sorbet and fruit platter.   

I think the non-sushi menu is the way to go - on the whole, a pretty decent place with a great view of the Strip, especially at sunset."}
{"text":"I've now eaten twice at Sushi Roku in Vegas. First time was the one that earned four stars. I placed one order at a time trying a lot of different fish and had the best o-toro sushi I've ever. What was great was that the sushi chef recognized right away that I was basically creating my own omakase and so he tried out a couple things on me like searing one of the o-toro sushi pieces, brushing it with some sort of a sauce and placing a truffle on top for what was an amazing one bite food experience. Unlike at Okada a couple of days earlier, Mirugai was very different tasting it was very fresh and much better. All of the sushi was very good, best sushi I've had in Vegas. The one kitchen dish consisting scallops and foie gras wasn't good. Each scallop was huge and lightly seared on the outside raw on the inside but just didn't do it for me.  

On my second trip to Sushi Roku I sat at the sushi bar once again, this time with a different chef. I didn't go all out like the last time but the sushi that I did eat this time was once again very good."}
{"text":"Incredible food, amazing service!  Braised short ribs are to die for, king crab special with champagne butter is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Roku was an awesome experience during my brief weekend vacay in Vegas.  My girlfriends and I enjoyed quite a few appetizers, including perfectly cooked edamame and scrumptiously fresh pieces of nigiri sushi.  For entrees, we ordered various rolls, more nigiri sushi, and a salmon/scallop entree that was absolutely delicious.

Service was also excellent.  We had a very attentive server who recommended some fabulous drinks and also dinner choices.  I've got nothing bad to say about the Roku--except that the prices aren't exactly cheap.  But you get what you pay for, I suppose.  And the last thing I wanted in Vegas was for bad sushi to ruin my luck!"}
{"text":"Excellent food in every category....FRESH and delicious, presentation and exotic selection. I love the yellowtail sashimi style YUM and the grilled asparagus & steak....yes you can have steak there too. I took clients to dinner and our server CJ was brilliant guiding us through the menu and making recommendations. Also, Cody the manager made sure we had everything we wanted. The head chef even payed a visit to our table asking if we enjoyed the food, and yes we did!! The restaurant is a winner for impressing your clients or casual night out with friends. You'll love the ambiance too."}
{"text":"The Sushi was average. I found that the Eel/Avocado roll had muddy taste, like you sometimes get in catfish and talapia. Not the most appealing. 

The Truffeled Sea Bass was the highlight of the meal, pefectly cooked and delicious. 

The chicken fried rice and Soba noodles were average as well. Not my favorite sushi place, but a decent option if you are staying at Caesar's."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  The sushi was fresh and creatively prepared, decor is very contemporary and sets the mood and the view was awesome. I don't know why, I just have this thing for views in big cities. Went here with hubby and it was very romantical. If anything else, come check out the bathroom doors. lol... you'll know what i'm talking about. I've been to the Pasadena location and nothing but good things to say 'bout that location too."}
{"text":"I come here at least a couple times a month. Everything you get here is amazing! Asparagus wrapped in steak, tempura shrimp, lobster shrimp, sea bass with miso sauce, katana roll. I can keep going. Everyone there is so awesome and so nice! I love our waitress Mikoh and ask for her every time. You won't be disappointed. Johnny, the manager, is also wonderful and nice. I will keep going here forever!"}
{"text":"I am giving 2 stars only because the service was good. The food is terrible; greasy and too salty! I sent my yellowfin sashimi with chiles back because it was drowning in oil. The seaweed salad was also drowning in oil. The food is over-praised and absolutely the worst sushi I've ever had. I also think all the oil on my seaweed salad made me sick."}
{"text":"We enjoy eating here whenever we are on the strip. The sushi is always great, and I am extremely difficult to please in that department.  I think we have our best meals at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome. We had gotten a seat by the window, and had an awesome view of the strip. We came here for my friend's 21st birthday. I ordered the peach passion drink, it was good but not too strong. For an appetizer, we ordered the filet mignon wrapped asparagus, they were decent. we ordered a couple of sushi rolls, the rice is a bit dry... some of the rice was even hard. i've definitely had better sushi rolls other places. The bill was pretty high for just the two of us. But, the place gets an a-ok to me because as we were leaving, our server surprised us with free shots for my friend's birthday."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi rolls I ever had! The service was great our servers were very attentive to us like some sushi restaurants this belongs up there! We were welcomed by the host I wish I could recall both the server and host name too bad I forgot it..oh shucks...but I would just like to say they were great, but when compared to the sushi restaurant I went to in Dallas the service is just down 1 level which is still good. Although it's a casual place it's a great place to eat if your traveling around all the states like me! The fish was fresh and was prepared very well, and the crab tasted awesome! The drinks came out in a timely matter as well. If your looking for a great place for a date or just a quick dinner this the place. Also don't forget to make reservations this place is packed! Overall I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great sushi here probably the best I've had. Now they just started happy hour Sunday to Thursday from 5-close. The happy hour menu has a good variety of rolls, appetizers and drinks for 5 each."}
{"text":"I wanted to give the review about a 4 star because there was a wait so the night started off not so good. We waited about 30 minutes before being sat down. After that it only went up from there. Jon served us and did a great job explanation the different dishes and recommended terrific dishes (even though I am not a big sushi fan). In all, bill was not too expensive and dinner was great."}
{"text":"I LOOOOOOVE sushi. I've had some truly amazing sushi in Los Angeles, San Francisco, even DC. 

This place is... ok. Not bad, but not astounding. But, good enough. Definitely below par what I've had before and what I was expecting for the venue and price, but it's Vegas, so it's quite doable. According to my boyfriend, it's the best sushi place in Vegas/the Strip. 

Also, I'm pretty sure their mocha green tea ice cream was from Trader Joe's! D:

Loved the ambiance and the decor though."}
{"text":"Food- mediocre 
Service- terrible, so SLOW
It's hard to enjoy your dinner when you're constantly looking to flag your server!"}
{"text":"I came here for Happy Hour last week. Got an $18 raspberry cocktail and two of the happy hour special sushi rolls for $4 each. Both of the ladies working at the bar were very nice and friendly, and my cocktail, while pricey, was also very good. The sushi was great. The salmon was perfectly fresh, and the tempura shrimp nicely cooked. Good rice, too. The lady next to me ONLY got happy hour food-- no alcohol at all-- and they were just as nice to her-- no grudging the lack of drink-buying. It's an attractive space and a pleasant Happy Hour environment. This place gets a thumbs-up by me."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants in Vegas.

Rolls are a bit pricey but are very creative and have much more fish than most of the other \"fine dining\" sushi restaurants on the strip. 

We had the Katana rolls which consisted of Tuna and Yellowtail on top of a roll with spicy tuna and shrimp tempura, these were fantastic, the shrimp was perfectly tender and the flavors worked well together.

Also had the crunchy spicy tuna with avocado which was perfect. And the spicy scallop roll which we really enjoyed.

I was quite hungry and wanted something hot so we tried the Chicken Yakitori  skewers, awesome, and the Kobe Beef skewers, alright but not as good as I would have hoped.

Service was excellent and the bar makes some very innovative cocktails, I am not much of a cocktail drinker myself but my better half ordered the Tokyo Cooler which I tried as well and agree with her opinion that it was fantastic.

Tab was just over $160 with three rolls, the chicken and kobe skewers, a shared dessert, two cocktails, and a couple beers. Not bad for Vegas."}
{"text":"I came back to Sushi Roku 3 times in 2 weeks.  The staff, food, and ambiance were wonderful!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to be with a group who all got the Omakase (chef's menu). That said, we had most delicious, freshest things that could be prepared that evening. Service was great, and presentation was lovely. Lots of high-end ingredients. I won't pretend this was cheap... its pricey, but the food was worth it. The wine menu is unfortunate... small selection, and crazy-over-priced. 

If you really appreciate sushi, and are looking for tasty bites in the desert, swing through for sure. If you have the time, order the Omakase... it was so yummy!!!

oh! and the view from the booths was GREAT!"}
{"text":"Just not a great Sushi Roku location.  The service was okay and the ambience was too - but the food wasn't fabulous and the sushi chef knew very little of the food he was serving.  When sitting at the sushi bar in a 'fine dining' japanese restaurant you kind of expect the chefs to be spot on and knowlegable about the food.  Not the case here.  If you want to spend this kind of money, go to Roka Akur - it's fantastic and worth every penny."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to visit friends in Scottsdale arizona. We always like to try new and different restaurants. We decided to go to Sushi  Roku and meet up with friends. The fish was of high quality and everything was fresh! The atmosphere was very unique, loved it. We had the Toban Yaki which was very expensive but it was worth the money. The premium tofu is a must-have and the spicy tuna was great. We had Nicole as our server. Nicole was very knowledgeable and her personality was lovely. When we asked for suggestions she listened to what each one of liked and she went from there. Everything Nicole brought out to us left us with big grins. Very tasty! Great job Nicole, we will be asking for you and learn more about the menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Vegas. The food and staff were amazing. I highly recommend to order the foie gras wrapped in yellowtail in truffle, everything from the menu you can't go strong."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful and it was a great hangout location. The food was good but by no means spectacular. I expected to be blown away by the food for the price. Small portions and not a lot of creativity for the price. Service was great"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing sushi! They seem to have a small menu but they can make anything you want. I recommend trying the baked carb hand roll with cream cheese!!! Just may be the best sushi I've ever had!"}
{"text":"We went there since it was suppose to be the \"happening\" sushi place on the strip. While sushi was good, I didn't find this place that much fun. The view of the strip is quite spectacular though."}
{"text":"This was a perfect spot to get delicious sushi.  The atmosphere was quiet and romantic and the food was amazing.  No doubt about it, we will be back."}
{"text":"Great spot inside the W hotel. Convenient location in addition to amazing food! Staff was very friendly & helpful. 

On the more formal & expensive side but worth it if you're looking for high quality sushi etc."}
{"text":"I love sushi roku, I go to the one in Newport Beach a lot and the taste here in Vegas was just as good as it is at home. The waitress was very nice and the service was great. 4 stars because the hostess wasn't too friendly but we also came without a reservation so not sure if that had anything to do with it, OH WELL. good alternative to other restaurants like nobu if you aren't into spending nobu money."}
{"text":"We made reservations, and our table was not available when we arrived.  Sat at the bar and ordered a few drinks.  When our table was finally ready, we had to walk our own drinks to the table.  I would have expected better service from a place like this.  The food was no better than the service.  On the bright side, our server did inform us that a particular dish we wanted to order was not up to par on its freshness that day.  I really appreciated his honesty.  

We expected some good sushi out of this place, but was not impressed at all.  The sushi was mediocre, and so was the rest of the food.  Nothing we ordered stood out.  Only worth going because it was in Vegas.  If this place was anywhere else, they would definitely not get the business they get.  I don't intend to come here again.  Spent enough money here to receive two desserts compliments of the manager, but the food just was not good. There are plenty of other places in Vegas worth the money."}
{"text":"I ate at Sushi Roku along with two other people last Sunday at around 5:30pm.  It wasn't crowded so we got a booth overlooking the window.  The waitress was attentive and the Asian-influenced ambiance was nice.


We ordered just enough food to feed the three of us.  The cost was around $120 dollars for three people, including two small sakes.  The dishes we ordered included:

APPETIZER
Hanaki Spicy Tuna on crispy rice cakes - This was quite good with a nice amount of spicy tuna on top of individual rice cakes.    The tuna had just a touch of spiciness.  There were about 5-6 pieces.

Sweet potato tempura (two pieces) - We had to send it back the first time because the sweet potato wasn't cooked enough.  It came out better the second time.  I probably won't order the tempura again.


SUSHI
Unagi Hand Roll - It was a standard unagi hand roll, which is my favorite sushi.  The sauce wasn't overpowering like some unagi hand rolls.
California Hand Roll - It was tasty since they included generous portions of real crab meat.

MAIN ENTREES
Chilean Sea Bass with Sauteed Spinach entree (Added Miso Soup and Rice for $6 which was a bit pricey) - I felt the fish was moist but had a fishy aftertaste but one of my guests thought it was perfectly cooked.  

Pan-fried  spicy jumbo shrimp with homemade potato chips - The shrimps were good-sized and were perfectly cooked. The sauce was not overly spicy.  The homemade chips were an interesting addition and tasted good with the sauce."}
{"text":"This is by far my new favorite spot for sushi! The atmosphere, service and especially food was the best I've ever had. I will be coming back and becoming a regular to this place! If you ever want sushi in Scottsdale this is the place to go and request Jon! He his knowledge for sushi and the whole menu led us to try new things we may never have tried and everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"Moving from Santa Monica to Scottsdale had its drawbacks, one concern being my access to high quality, fresh sushi. It goes without saying that the food is exquisite from the menu staple items, to the daily specials, and the sake selection! All of the employees are knowledgeable and friendly as they guide you through the menu to ensure a perfect meal. The team is lead by a great manager, Mike Kirsch. I booked a New Years Eve dinner at Roku for my girlfriend and I. Needless to say, it was extremely busy. Mike took the time to swing by my table several times to check on us and step in with refills and food drop offs when the wait staff was tied up. He helped make New Years a perfect evening! I've been back several times since, and have had the pleasure to meet the other manager Dan who hosted a business meal for me. Dan held the same high standards as Mike and guided us through a fantastic evening. This is by far my favorite sushi spot in town for any occasion. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"The service was horrible!!! Have never had service like this anywhere, especially a higher end sushi restaurant!!! Food took an hour and twenty, the wrong order was given, our appetizer never showed up, no water until I requested it. It was 3pm. Empty in there. No excuse. Our waitress was terrible. Two other couples arrived after us were in and out in 45 minutes. The sushi was good but not for the service or price. Go to Koi, Sushi Samba or somewhere else."}
{"text":"I heard they were very good at catering to food allergens, but we had a pretty poor experience.  Their gluten free menu was really limited compared to their normal menu.  I have a soy intolerance, and they brought me crab in a soy wrapper.  We didn't figure this out until I was a couple of bites in.  Then they didn't discount my meal.  The waiter took forever even though the place was pretty empty.  Lame all around."}
{"text":"The ambiance of the restaurant was nice. There was an excellent choice of different foods in the menu. The chef's specials were delicious. The waiter was wonderful, we never had to look for him, he was very attentive to our needs. Overall, the dining experience was excellent and we would visit again. However, I would like to point out that when I made reservations through Opentable.com I had stated that this was a special occasion we were celebrating (my parents 40th wedding anniversary) and no-one had bothered to bring a special dessert (as others were receiving) with candles. This was disappointing that the note in my Open Table reservation to the matradee was not read. (We had spent well over $300 that evening.)"}
{"text":"Had a great meal with my mom. The staff was very attentive and courteous. Although they couldn't make an expresso to save their live, the food and service made up for it. If you can sit next to the windows. The \"booths\" suck for comfort if you're a sloucher like me."}
{"text":"So, the first word that comes to my mind is LOUD.  The food was good, and the drinks were good, but it was hard to hear the people at my table.   I can't think of anything that stands out on the menu as being great, but we had a few rolls, the shrimp cups (those were the best), and some tempura.  All in all, it was a scene, pricey, and decent food.  Will I go back?  Not sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service Friday evening.  Giovanni our server was tip top.  A couple of menu items were 86'd - so he simply recommended other menu options.  Dan - the wine/sake somm - offered excellent sake pairings.  Steve GM - checked in on us a few times as if we were regulars.  Will definitely be back....."}
{"text":"Sort of hard to find, on third level in the Caesar's shops, just find an information booth and ask for directions.

Can park for free at Caesar's self parking, parking garage is close to the shops.  Come out of elevators, take first right, take left one you get to Fizz, take another left after  you enter the shops, good all the way down until  you hit a fountain, walk around it and go to the right, walk straight until you get to the escalators, go up, you'll see it in the back to the right after that.  

Only did rolls, tried: 
- Crab Dynamite (favorite)
- California
- Popcorn Shrimp Tempura w/ Jalapeno (really good!)
- Shrimp Tempura w/ Asparagus
- Spicy Tuna (tuna melts in your mouth, one of best i've had)

Does take reservations, used OpenTable

Nice ambiance, service kind of slow but nice people

3 people, 3 drinks, 5 rolls, $100 bill."}
{"text":"I ate here with a large group of girlfriends during my bachelorette weekend and was impressed with both the food and the atmosphere.  The view of the strip is excellent, and it is very chic inside.  We ordered a multitude of rolls and they were both aesthetically pleasing and delicious.  I recommend the sparkling blueberry sake (if you like sweet wine) and the scallop appetizer.  As with most sushi restaurants, it was quite pricey, but well worth it overall.  I would definitely return here in a group or on a date."}
{"text":"Fantastic late dinner! Our server, Jess, was very attentive, and recognized my wife's chocolatini (special request, not on menu) wasn't as requested. Very inventive menu. I recommend the beef tataki app! We had sushi rolls and a couple cocktails. Perfect! Thee Wagyu roll was ridiculously good. I remembered a \"free white choc brownie\" offer somewhere, and Jess was quick to ask if I was on Yelp!.....and yes, it was amazing."}
{"text":"I was here 3 weeks ago with friends. I went back the next night alone. The staff was friendly and welcoming, the bartenders Sam and Regis both remembered my name from the night before. The service was prompt, the food great and the atmosphere awesome. I will be back in AZ next week and will def visit this venue.

It is THE place to start out also,  with your friday and saturday night shenanigans ( :"}
{"text":"Loved the decor. The \"strawberry fizz\" drink was delicious and had quite the kick without tasting alcoholic. Also had a taste of the \"pear martini\" which was a bit sweet for me but my dining partner loved it. The yellowtail carpaccio with peppers was yummy. Had to send back the rock shrimp because it was soggy and weird... ick! Tried some new things for sushi... liked my first taste of kanpachi, the ikura (one of my usual  favorites) was good, nothing special. Also tried uni--- really good! Had tried it once before but it wasn't fresh enough. Basically, you'll pay ridiculous prices but the fish quality is actually good. Mom had the chilean seabass which was pretty good except not cooked all the way through, ick! Service was great and our server was a sweetheart. Wouldn't rush back due to price, but it was still a fun, satisfying dinner with a few hiccups!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more but, after our recent (and only) experience, I'm barely able to give 2 stars. First: it took us close to 20/25 minutes to find this place after entering Caesar's and asking several hotel employees. *No, we weren't drunk or stoned; it's that hidden. Second: When we did finally arrive to the hostess stand and nobody else was around, they both just stared at us. We said hello and that we had a reservation. One of them lead us to a table right next to a table of ladies and all their bags. We looked around the empty restaurant and asked if we could possibly be sat a bit farther away. Done with hesitation. Third: I eat fish/seafood but, my husband doesn't but, can usually find something on any menu. I asked our waitress what she recommended for both of us given the no fish deal. She suggested a shrimp dish. ??? My food came first while we waited for my husband's. This is the fault of our waitress by misfiring the order to the kitchen;  any good waitperson knows all food for the table should come relatively around the same time. The sushi was good; they have ankimo!! The best? No way! For $200 (no booze) I expect much better than good. I think the most insulting was being charged $3 for extra \"pita\" pieces when we wanted more than the 4 slices the hummus originally came with. On a completely personal bitchy note: our waitress' grill was all over the place (possibly missing teeth, jagged, crowded) and very distracting when looking at her. Her appearance didn't match the chic/trendy look this place is going for. As a local, we probably won't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Las Vegas and probably the U.S.

The sashimi is flown in daily form Japan.

We came with a large group, gave him our price point per-person, and he brought out outstanding dishes. 

If you like sushi, this is the place to eat it in Vegas."}
{"text":"I would give this place negative starts if I could.

Food poisoning aside (this could happen anywhere), it was truly the worst dining experience in Vegas.

The wait staff were rude, unattentive and just gave off a general bad vibe.  And since we were a party of 8, they slapped on an 18% service charge.  Again, that would've been acceptable if we received ANY SERVICE at all.

Views were great but how can you enjoy it when you spent the evening trying to flag down your waiter?  I ended up having to get up to get someone to get me more tea.  I felt sorry for the booth next to ours because the waiter served my tea climbing OVER their seat.  Maybe he was too tired to walk the extra 3 feet around to fill my tea cup?

Given the level of competition on the Strip, one would think service would be stellar but I've had better service at any strip mall sushi diner.  

Truly awful, stay away."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and love their selection of sushi and sushimi. On this trip we tried Octupus and a sushimi combination. Fantastic. The curry sushi we ordered exploded with flavor with each bite. And the crab fried rice may have been among the top 3 fried rice dishes we've ever had. Delicious."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing dinner can't tell you what was more enjoyable the service or the quality of the food. Soraya was our server, we told her it was her first time there, and she basically highlighted the entire menu for us. The presentation & the quality of the seafood was outstanding. Our favorites were the hamachi appetizer & the white lotus roll. (Which I was told us not on the menu). I've gotten to the point now where I just ask the server \" order dinner for us something that will make us want to come back here again\"."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner after watching Phantom of the Opera.  Ordered the Sushi combination and Tuna Carpacciowhich I thought was ok.  The Seabass truffle was actually really good.  The best part of the meal.  

We had dessert and I thought the banana flambe was really good but the volcano was ok.  Overall it wasn't too bad. If I come back again, it would probably be for the Seabass Truffle and Banana Flambe."}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi and we eat it often at different restaurants. 
Also, Great Happy Hour 4-7pm!
Cheap but professional, food was literally delivered to our table within 2 mins of ordering each course.
Had multiple items, but the Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice was exceptional, ordered a second one after the first!
Visit!"}
{"text":"Great summer menu going on right now with fun drinks. So convenient if you're staying at the W."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to grab an early bite while shopping in the Forum Shops at Caesars and chanced upon their happy hour. Happens every day (as stated by other reviewers) between 4 to 7 pm. Talk about a great deal on sushi in Las Vegas nonetheless. 

Well drinks cost $3 each and a large beer will set you back $5. Great way to begin any rock star adventure slinging a few drinks before hitting the tables and clubs. Hint: $$$-saver!!!

We had popcorn shrimp tempura, tuna tataki, shrimp and chips, spicy scallop roll, and fried calamari which cost $4/each. They don't skimp on the portions so order up."}
{"text":"Food is really good tastes  amazing too. Also the server was very professional.  BUT literally every dish was like nothing there. If u really wanna try here just let u guys know. U will cost 31 $ for like 5pics of shrimp and tons of chips on the top n it's called pan fried shrimp with chips lol."}
{"text":"Service was awesome. My husband and I ate there on 10/17/2010 for dinner and it wasn't too busy.

We were seated right away, and our server was extremely attentive. She even suggested some sushi that wasn't on the menu and she had good suggestions.

The sushi was decent but extremely pricey. You're on the Vegas strip. You have to expect it.

Seaweed Salad = yum
Crab Dynamite = yum
Shima Roll = yum
Red Sun Roll = yum
premium sashimi special = alright

If you get the Crab Dynamite, order it first. It takes some time to prepare."}
{"text":"Oh what a night of culinary delights with my colleagues in Las Vegas at Sushi Roku.   In the famous Forum Shops at Caesars on the 3rd floor, this dark and sensual place is a great intimate place to gather with friends or on a romantic date.
I had one of the most outstanding dishes I had ever had  - it was the tempura lobster with a miso glaze.  It was sweet and amazing because of the sticky miso and crunchy because of the panko tempura and juicy bits of lobster.  Our table couldn't get enough and was like heaven.  This item was a special on the menu and is a must have."}
{"text":"Delicious decor and stylish food!  Great Bento box for late lunch.  Nice service and professional management."}
{"text":"I went to Sushi Roku with my colleagues. This restaurant is located in Caesars Palace Hotel. The food itself is OK. I liked some kind of sushi rolls.From this restaurant, we could see nice strip view(south direction)."}
{"text":"I was shocked to stumble upon Roku having been at their other location in Phoenix.

My BF and I had lunch there last week. The food is amazing as always and the service was excellent!! The view is something hard to come by in Vegas and we enjoyed watching all the tourist walk down the strip.

The only issue I had is with the bartender and the man who appeared to be the Manager/GM. You can clearly hear him yelling at her in front of guest. Its so sad that people cant be pulled to the side to discuss employee related issues."}
{"text":"Folks here are way cool. I asked the head chef Haruhiko 'Haru' Takeshita to freestyle our dinner and he said no problem!! Needless to say, this our second time eating here on this Vegas run!"}
{"text":"The sushi was over priced and not that good. We ordered a shrimp tempura/jalapeño roll. It was literally just that. A small piece of tempura shrimp with jalapeño slices rapped in rice. No sauce, no other filling. What a waste. The waitress was very good as was the rest of the service. But when you spend over 100.00 on sushi, you'd like it to be memorable. It turns out it was because I woke up at 2:30 in the AM running to the bathroom..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful!! It is very modern and comfortable at the same time.  The service was amazing... almost better than the food.  

The appetizers were very good.  The miso soup was hearty and filling - the best I have ever had. The popcorn rock shrimp was amazing - one of the best foods I have ever eaten!  The sushi rolls were good, but certainly not the best I have had (Crystal Fish in Monterey, CA is still # 1 for me).  Also, the pricing was quite high - about what I would expect for a tourist city like Vegas.

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Sushi Roku.  It was a great addition to our Vegas trip."}
{"text":"I gave an extra star, or a second star for the decor. Very nice place and view. Otherwise, the food is so bad and skimpy that one star is too much.
I don't mind small and tasty portions, but these were embarrassingly skimpy and notg so good. Udon soup came with tempura on a side, as we requested. Tempura consisted of one shrimp split in quarters and you only get two skimpy quarters of that one shrimp. Nada mas. 
My sushi box should have had four slices of sashimi, but what they did, they took one piece of tuna and split it in four pieces. So the four slices are paper thin and see through! It also came with beef, which was overcooked and not good. 
I was still hungry and went ahead and ordered a sushi roll. It was decent size but not great tasting. 
They should be ashamed of serving such food for such price. But even if it was cheap, which it wasn't, they should be ashamed, you don't serve two quarters of a shrimp as your tempura."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and decor. The food is just okay, to put it mildly: my friend and I ended up with food poisoning after visiting this place. Service was slow. Overall: good for drinks, not for food. An overpriced and pretentious place."}
{"text":"I ordered unfiltered sake, seaweed salad, toro, albacore tuna, japanese snapper, yellowtail, salmon. Huge pieces of sashimi. I should've ordered the specialty rolls but I stuck with simple stuff. I wasn't that impressed BUT the service  was phenomenal. The waiters soooo attentive. They even packed my leftover sushi on top of ice and gave a to go cup for my left over sake. They were knowledgeable and let me taste two different sakes. I sat at the sushi bar and the chefs were friendly. The main dining area looks over the strip. It's also on the top floor of where the stores are."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I had dinner there on a Friday night. Our table was not ready when we got there but we sat in the bar area and enjoyed one of their delicious specialty cocktails. 

We had excellent customer service both from the waitress and even the GM stopped by our table more than once to check on us. Both had excellent recommendations and everything we tried was delicious. Stick with the classic plates and you won't be disappointed.

I thought the pricing was on par with every good sushi place that I have been too. I even thought it was reasonable."}
{"text":"Great place!  It's in Ceasar's forum shops on the 3rd floor.  I sat at the sushi bar and they treated me so nicely.  Very good service and the food was good!  Fresh sushi, great rolls and interesting appetizers.  I had the spicy yellowtail rolls and the toro jalapeno which rocked!  Really good food, cool place, good service."}
{"text":"Moved to Vegas two years ago from LA and have really struggled to find good sushi. So far, sushi Roku sets the standard. The chefs are extremely good at what they do. They bring their own flair to standard items. They also have managed to create some very tasty and interesting dishes of their own. The hanabi is very tasty as is the tuna tartare. The salmon skin hand roll ordered a little extra crispy is the best I've ever had - the taste of the salmon skin though delicate, is not oily or overwhelmed by the other ingredients in the roll. Suggestion for all diners - try the sushi before you bathe it in soy and wasabi. You don't want to mask any of the flavors. Only real downsides - 1 it's on the strip so getting to and from can be difficult, and 2 it's expensive (but sometimes, you do get what you pay for)."}
{"text":"Service and ambiance are top notch. Sit at the sushi bar if possible for a great time interacting with the chefs. 

Sushi was fresh and prompt. The sushi chefs steered us to the freshest selections.

As others have said it's a little on the pricy side but hey, it's Vegas!."}
{"text":"As good as it gets, We had a party of five and were treated like royalty, Combo of servers kept the food and drinks coming. We shared sushi rolls and they even worked in the timing for our person that ordered a steak. Rolls were excellent and the servers helped suggest a few new ones for round two, a bit of a shock when the bill came because it was lower than expected."}
{"text":"Based on my own experience, I'm pretty surprised that anyone would have rated this below 5 stars.  Our experience was amazing.  The head sushi chef, Jason, took great care of us.  The fish was delicious, the rice was perfect, the ambience was very chic and overall I would rank this as one of my top 5 dining experiences.  

Probably the best item I had was Foie Gras, wrapped with Hamachi and Chiso leaf, topped-off with a white truffle and gold flakes."}
{"text":"Guys, super nice place and the food is outstanding, high quality with great service.

The manager Justen is trenedous and makes every dining experience very memorable!

*A must visit if in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"we got 3 rolls and they were some of the best we've had. the prices aren't too bad for sushi in las vegas. if you can get seated in the front, there is a nice view of the strip

when we went, there were 2 huge birthday parties that were extremely loud and disturbing. I am hoping that isn't an every day occurrence or i wouldn't want to return"}
{"text":"Came in town for a long weekend & was recommended to try this place for the best sushi. It did not disappoint! From the great service by our waitress Kylie to the awesome ambience of the restaurant we definitely enjoyed ourselves and hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"I love giant clam, this place always has it fresh and crunchy,
Don't let them seat you in the front area where you walk in, sit in the back by the windows , the view is great !. 
I, minus 1 star for the price here . Even with my local discount."}
{"text":"Rob our sever took great care of us.  His service was amazing.  Great place to have breakfast, lunch and dinner!  The food was delicious and sushi/sashimi were fresh.  Drinks were great as well.  All the people working were very friendly and hospitable.  Thank you Rob & Sushi Roku for taking good care of us on my birthday!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch during my last trip to LV.  The environment is pretty nice, and the decoration is modern, but the service is kind of slow even though there weren't too many customers when we were there.  We ordered the lunch combo from their lunch menu.  The food is just ok.  Everything is just on the average level, but I was expecting it would be better given the price they charge.  So overall, this is not really a place you must try in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent service despite the very busy night we were there.  The bar area was alive and had very attentive bartenders.  Upstairs in the VIP area...  bartenders were not attentive it took over 10 minutes before leaving because we were never asked or offered to order a drink.  

My order was correct and delicious for dinner!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Sushi Roku.  The Hanabi was phenomenal as was the shrimp appetizer.  The Chilean seabass was extremely tasty as well.   The service was great on a night that was busy to say the least.  Definitely will visit here again."}
{"text":"Having been to Sushi Roku in Santa Monica this was truly a let down.  Although the fish was fresh, the preparation, menu and overall experience lacked what compelled us to go there after having had many good experiences in LA."}
{"text":"Visited on a Monday evening. Easy reservations via Open Table at the time requested. Seated immediate at a dark intimate half circle booth with a view of the chefs preparing sushi. The wait staff was friendly, prompt, and put up with our sake bomb messes all night. 

Food was well presented and tasty. Ordered seaweed and cucumber salads which were not the expected traditional versions but still good. Excellent Yellow tail small dish followed by various rolls. It's a fun swanky place for date night. A bit pricy and non-traditional but that's what you'd expect for a W Hotel restaurant. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It always helps out a place when not only is the food great but the service also.  Been coming here ever since the grand opening and even though it's in an obscure area of the Forum Shops at Caesar's, it's definitley worth the trek.  Always have consistently good food here with great decor (and if you sit at the right spot on a nice summer night, they open the sliding windows open so you can \"feel\" the strip view).  Have come with small groups as well as large and this place never fails me.  Some recommended dishes:  Seared yellowtail with diced chile (extra chile for me please!!), popcorn rock shrimp, chilean seabass, chicken nuggets with that cilantro-like dipping sauce, and pretty much any of their sushi.  I've been to all the Roku's (except the newly opened one at the W in AZ) and this one is as good if not better than any of the other ones.  It's always bigger, badder, and better in Vegas."}
{"text":"While in Vegas, we were looking for a Nobu alternate.  The reviews led me to S. Roku.  The decor was expected of a Vegas restaurant - sleek, dark and trendy.  The food was comparable to any other sushi joint.  We didn't have anything that was memorable, so I guess that makes this place forgettable considering all the other options on the Strip. Also, there was a rather long wait for some items to be delivered to our table considering the place was pretty empty."}
{"text":"Delicious. Although the prices are high, it's kinda standard pricing for good sushi on the strip. Shishito peppers were amazing. Fresh featured sushi and sashimi were amazing. Loved it."}
{"text":"My whole night at Sushi Roku was full of \"I should have known better....\"

I should have known better to not trust the front desk folks at my hotel to make a restaurant recommendation..... should have  trusted YELP

I should have known better that trendy and hip don't always equal quality dinning .... should have consulted YELP 

I should have known better ... when the hostess tells you 30 minutes for the next table and you don't get seated after waiting for a good 45 minutes, its time to get the hell out ..... YELP would have saved me 

I should have known better .... when you're waiting for a table and you see a sea full of empty tables that the restaurant could care less if you are waiting or not ..... god YELP me 

I should have known better when the restaurant never seats you at a table, keeps making up excuses as to why you can't sit down, you find a bug in your drink and they only comp you for part of your bill .... its time to give that place a big YELPIN review

Ok so bottom line ... 
Sushi Roku is a trendy place in Scottsdale, its kind of hip.. but again you're in Scottsdale 

I should have known better and left restaurant after being told it would take 30 minutes to get a table.  But instead I decided to take my chances and that was my bad. 

The saving graces of the night was my dinner party, and the very helpful and wonderful waiter STAN.  Stan allowed me to give Roku an extra star.  

Sum it up:
Roku ain't worth it... move on"}
{"text":"Came for lunch and got the Spicy Tuna Don Buri.  They did it with the brown rice risotto for me, instead of the usual white.  It was great, I've never had spicy tuna this way.  It was mushy-style and spread over the rice and topped with some vegetables.  They forgot my miso soup though."}
{"text":"Great place, reasonable prices, and great quality. We enjoyed grilled chicken, eel rolls and salads"}
{"text":"This place is a little difficult to find but the food was great. Everything was fresh and taste great. I will definitely go back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night, and I have to say, each time we've visited, we have had nothing but exceptional service. Jon was our server; his knowledge of the menu is outstanding. We even let him order for us! His recommendations exceeded our expectations! You truly have an asset on your hands! We will definitely be back and will request him again! Great job to him and all of the staff!"}
{"text":"My review is based mostly on the excellent service I received from Jenn the bartender...she was absolutely delightful! I came here with my friend (both new to the area) and we had a lot of fun joking around with her. She was both professional and fun...I've been working in the service industry for 5 years...I know great service and I'll definitely be back! We ordered 4 specialty rolls, all of them were delicious...this place was not disappointing in any way. Overall wonderful dining experience, can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Went solo for some miso soup and sushi. The sushi was good, but the blue tuna sushi I had actually smelled a little fishy. Good spot to view the strip, but I wouldn't go back as there are other sushi places worth checking our."}
{"text":"I went here a few months ago with some friends while visiting Vegas for a friends birthday, our server was amazing and helpful when trying to figure out what to order. The food was amazing and the atmosphere was great for a few lunchtime drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Arrived a little late and needed to rush the order so we could make a show.  The waiter was extremely helpful and ended up being an interesting guy who chatted with us a little.  The decor and view were pretty good, and I'm a sucker for their Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus.  Everything arrived quickly and we managed to get in and out in time for the show."}
{"text":"Food and service excellent, but young and inexperienced Restaurant Manager in way over his head for such a nice restaurant. Rude and unpolished treatment of customers. Won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"We love sushi and loved the unique spin to many of the items on the menu. The food was outstanding. However, the restaurant is noisy and filled with young, \"beautiful people\", so do not come here if you are looking for a quiet romantic night. The overall vibe of the W in Scottsdale is one of snobbery and elitism, very disappointing for a W, and we have travelled to many across the country and usually enjoy attentive and upscale service. The good news is that although the hotel is lacking, the wait staff at this restaurant is exceptional and really made our evening. CJ deserves special recognition for making it a great night. It was easy to see that he loves his job- he knows the menu, helped us pick great plates to share and was friendly and engaging. Because of the food and CJ, we will be back to eat, but will stay at another hotel."}
{"text":"Wasn't a huge fan of any of the rolls, and the gyoza was different from what I'm used to I guess. A lot of beef taste...
Service was good. Dirty martinis were great. Felt like the food took a little more time than usual to come out. Great looking place with a great view though!"}
{"text":"Quality sushi that uses top of the line nori for their rolls and it makes a big difference.

The spicy tuna roll has a nice kick to it and the katana roll is tasty as well."}
{"text":"A few points:

1) Service can be better -- the way the seater spreads out the customers gives each one privacy, but with how the restaurant organizes, it makes it difficult to get back to guests in time when they are ready to order. I noticed that another waitress had to step in when I started getting impatient.

2) Good ingredients on the sushi -- the fish is on point. There was fish with sesame oil on top of my chirashi donburi that was fantastic. I didn't expect sesame oil to pair so well.

3) The rice for the sushi sucks. It's bland, it lacks proper levels of acidity. It takes away from the deliciousness of the other ingredients."}
{"text":"Been going Sushi Roku for five years only one of its the best , freshest sushi in town also great service and friendly staff !! You won't be disappointed plus General manager and other managers are amazing to get along so please go there and see for your self! Cheers Roku!!"}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't in a mall. Granted, a very very nice mall, but it takes away some of the allure for me.

That said.....the food is VERY good and I love the atmosphere inside. Tuna tartare spring rolls -- why didn't I think of that? The sushi was also very fresh and well-prepared....

Pricey? Yeah, but not outragous. We splurged on $125 bottle of champagne and got dessert and I think it came to $260 for two people.

I'm not sure if I loved it enough to go back on my next trip to Vegas, but it was definitely worth it for the first trip."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi experience.  Ask for John, probably the best waiter on the Strip.  He recommended the perfect mix of sushi and sake to cure our hard fought Vegas hangovers.  Great atmosphere and a fantastic view."}
{"text":"This place is great. Definitely order the spicy hamachi appetizer. Sushi is some of the best I've had in a long time. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the time to come here. Cheap drinks and dishes. Sushi is fresh and delicious! Appetizers are always on point."}
{"text":"Stared out with a lychee mojito. Sweet and strong...  If I wasn't tipsy I would have had a second!  The hot sake came out hot (not warm) and was nice and smooth...

Baked crab roll was like nothing I've ever tasted before. I was expecting a volcano/dynamite typical topping but the topping had a curry flavor.  Pleasant and refreshing surprise. 

Also had a fried spicy tuna roll-don't remember what the restaurant called it. It was really good. I LOVE fried rolls!!!!!  Delicious and came out warm.  Yummmmmm!

Uni nigiri was sweet and left me wanting more...

Banana flambe was ok. I was expecting something more like banana fosters...  It was more like a fruit medley...  

Restaurant is modern and decorated beautifully.  The view of the strip is gorgeous!  Really nice place to take your gf after you've spent all your winnings on her at the forum shops!!!  Hehehe!  =)

Overall, I was pleased with dinner minus the flambe. On my way out I read that they have happy hour from 4-6..."}
{"text":"Went here when this place had their anniversary week and all food for dinner was 50% off. I walked by this place several times. Scoped out the menu but was too afraid to commit due to the price and my lack of success with Asian food let alone sushi in Scottsdale.  I'm from Seattle where grade A sushi is sold from grocery stores.

This place did not disappoint. Their wide selection of fresh fish is impressive along with their A5 wagyu beef. The New Zealand King salmon melted in your mouth as well as their thick slices of sashimi (yellow tail, tuna toro, snapper) gave you the perfect amount of balance of flavor on your tongue.  If you're not into raw fish, their japanese fried chicken is crispy and juicy-you really don't even need the aioli that comes with it.

I did also have their BBQ short ribs that were supposed to be Korean style. It wasn't bad but it was doused in a lot of sauce and a bit too salty for my liking. I typically like short ribs dried and grilled without being sauced.


Service was impeccable. Rene was very knowledgeable of the menu and did a great job describing the seafood items and the chefs preparation of each item. Having worked at upscale restaurants before, I'm truly impressed by this individual. 

Overall good place but probably a bit outside my price range for how much I normally eat on any given day. Great value during promotions such as their anniversary week."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku is the only place I will go to for sushi in AZ. Their food is excellent, service is consistently great from their wait staff, and their manager Dan always goes above and beyond for his customers. You won't be disappointed when you visit Sushi Roku at The W hotel!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!! I am getting married in August and was in Vegas for a Bachelorette party! We came here for dinner and were all blown away.  Sat at the bar in order to get the happy hour menu, and had Donald (donnie?) as our server.  He was amazing, attentive, and gave some great suggestions.  We ordered a ton of appetizers (the brussell  sprouts and shrimp with miso sauce were a few favorites) and each ordered some rolls (the Jalapeno shrimp roll was great).  All the food was great, someone at the bar bought us a drink (some kind of infused vodka with champagne) and Donnie arranged to have a desert brought out for me to congratulate me on my upcoming wedding, complete with a gorgeous firework sparkler thing in a champagne glass! Will be recommending this place to everyone and will be coming back every time I come back to Vegas! Thanks for the great food, ambiance, and of course, the customer service.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Food is really soso.  I came with a hope that the precious 'low stars' were just occasional.  The fish is fresh.  Chef is nice (I sat at bar).  But that is about it.  Service is soso.  Waiter never came back after taking initial order.  Splash the $18 (5oz) sake on his trade, and did not say any.

Ordered the assorted sushi.  Rice too dry, no moist.  Not enough vinegar tan in my humble opinion.    

Do not come with high hope.  Random sushi place in Japan would probably exceed this place.

PS.  Choose Nobu, similar price, much higher quality.  They're only open after 5pm.  Hence me being here sharing a friendly warning."}
{"text":"Excellent quality and selection of sushi, all fresh and prepared in a unique way.  I would recommend the the Omakase sashimi appetizer, as well as the grilled octopus.  The soft shell crab roll and the individual sushi that we ordered were also excellent.  The only reason I wouldn't give Sushi Roku 5 stars is I was charged for wine that I didn't order and sent back (and unfortunately didn't notice that night that it was on the bill) and the parking is $12 - albeit you get a $6 credit from the restaurant."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale on business and was able to stay thru the weekend.  On this past Saturday, already staying at the W Hotel, I decided to try out Sushi Roku located in the lobby.  My business partner and I were warmly greeted and chose to nestle in to a corner spot at the sushi bar.  We ended up in front of the Sous Chef Tony.  He recommended doing \"omakase\" and basically started flooding our plates with beautiful pieces of elegantly dressed fish from all over the world like golden eye snapper, live octopus and wagyu beef.  Our server Jonathan was attentive and recommended an awesome bottle of sake; the Gensai.  Even the manager, Dan stopped by to check on us and explain how sake was brewed and the grading processes.  We not only learned a ton but we enjoyed the experience as a whole from service to food to drink and even the ambiance.  Highly recommended and I hope to be in Scottsdale for business again soon simply for this establishment!!!"}
{"text":"Will make this short and sweet. Been there twice and both times the food and service was fantastic. I can't say enough on how great the food is. A little pricey but in my opinion well worth it!!"}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences in a long time. The food was excellent but our server Sarah stole the show. She is extremely knowledgeable and very personable. Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"We decided on this sushi restaurant based upon other Yelper's reviews.  We were not disappointed.  There were many wonderful choices on the menu but my husband's love for Salmon, avocado and jalapenos was satisfied when the restaurant made him a \"special\" hand roll with soy wrapper and included these 3 items.  I have posted the picture.  Also try the albacore tuna tacos and the Spicy Rock Shrimp with asparagus cut roll.  Our waiter Khang, originally from Hawaii, was exceptional.  We had a wonderful view of the strip from our table and we couldn't have had a better time."}
{"text":"As a sushi lover, I had high expectation for sushi roku, but after my dinner experience here I really think this restaurant is totally overrated. We had blue fin o toro and makuro, the fish was pretty fresh, however not surprisingly good. Despite the size of sushi being too small, the major problem this restaurant had was that the sushi rice was not good. The portion of rice and sticky rice was off, so the sushi rice was not tiny sour-ish nor sticky enough. The decoration of the restaurant was really nice but I don't think I will visit again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our meal at Sushi Roku.  We were fortunate enough to make it for the 5 year anniversary and everything on the menu was 50% off, except for drinks!  It was an awesome deal and we took advantage of it.  During this Vegas weekend, I went to Sushi Roku, Okada, and Sushisamba....Sushi Roku was my favorite. The sushi rolls were awesome...I ordered all of the rolls my waiter recommended and the most expensive ones too.....heck it was 50% off!  They were all good, however, I wasn't a big fan of the lobster roll.  

We did encounter some problems with service, however.  It seemed our waiter disappeared on us.  We ordered another round of drinks and it never showed up.  We asked another waiter to check on our drinks and she said it was coming soon...but still no drinks appeared.  We asked yet another waiter to find out about our drinks...finally the manager came and apologized and offered our round of drinks for free.  Since our round of drinks was offered for free,  we still enjoyed our time at Sushi Roku.

The food was awesome, drinks were great, ambiance was cool, but service is a little lacking. Okada had better service but I didn't think food was as good and I would prefer to go back to Sushi Roku next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour menu!! This is definitely my go-to Japanese restaurant in Vegas. My sisters and I enjoyed delicious authentic Japanese food -  chicken stuffed shishito, mushroom tempura, salmon and avocado sushi roll etc... The staff were all friendly and professional and the manager was very hospitable and accommodating. I can't wait to come back next month - this time, dinner with friends. I highly recommend Sushi Roku."}
{"text":"I don't eat seafood. I have no business reviewing this place, right? Well, my boyfriend had a craving for sushi while we were passing through on a cross country road trip. So we stopped in Phoenix for the evening and this spot came with highest recommendations. Panko encrusted salmon for him and veggie rolls for me. I barely saw the plate set down before the salmon was devoured. The veggie roll however...man, did they put some spin on a pretty basic dish. I'm never wowed by sushi restaurants simply because I never order anything wow-able. They sure proved me wrong. Totally filling, deliciously flavorful and made exactly to my particular orders (not too big, rice paper, no seaweed, etc. etc.). We had the pesto tomato mozzarella salad and chicken satay (both specials) as well and while they were devoured pretty quickly they just don't stick out in my mind like those veggie rolls. A pretty innocuous dish that most would likely never seek out but if you have a finicky friend on the fence about joining you for a night at Sushi Roku, they cannot go wrong with this order."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints - food is always amazing, service rocks, and the view of the strip kills! Make sure you yell at the sushi chefs when you enter."}
{"text":"It is the terrible Japanese Restaurant I have had been in my life.
I was order one fry rice, but the fry rice about triple salty could not eat at all.
I asked them to give me a bow of rice to mix with it, but they charged me extra fee for the rice.
I could pay for it, but they were not even try to make another fry rice for me, but charged me the extra fee to make me feel very bad service.
I will never go there any more in the future...."}
{"text":"First time at Sushi Roku was for a Valentine's Day dinner. Had reservations for 8:30pm arrived 15 minutes early. As I walked in, the atmosphere seemed alright but man the hostess did not know how to greet or check people in. Waited about 10 minutes and not a single effort was taken to greet us nor did she ask if we had reservations. Took a little longer to be seated and the lighting inside was too dark which didn't do well with the tiny little print on the menu. Only highlight of the night was the sushi. The sushi was absolutely delicious. The appetizer did come out after our sushi but still overall the food was delicious and well displayed. Long story story food was delicious but service could have been better."}
{"text":"I went here even though I can't eat ra fish. I was very happy that my server, Jon, guided me through the menu and suggested dishes that I could eat. His knowledge and service were both memorable and made my experience amazing. Will definitely be coming back as long as Jon is there."}
{"text":"I thought this place was overpriced and the service was definitely lacking.  I have a food allergy to avocado and they treated me like a leper.  One of the items on the lunch sushi special was a california roll, which without avocado is a simulated crab roll since they apparently don't have cucumber on them here?  Anyway, it was my birthday and we paid more than $40 for lunch here...I felt like I wasted my money though they did give me a cool sparkler and sing happy birthday with a cool dessert...that was the only thing that got them up to two stars."}
{"text":"Perfect location, great atmosphere, outstanding selection, stellar service. Each of the zillion items we ordered, was so good; and given all of the above, we did not at all feel it was overpriced. Will recommend and will return."}
{"text":"Yellowtail, Atmosphere, and Dan the manager from NYC is the reason for the 5-star review. Heard we were in town from New York and he came over and introduced himself.  Thank you for personalizing our visit."}
{"text":"WOW! I have heard about this place for a really long time and my wife and I finally decided to try it. All of the food we had was amazing, the best part about our meal was the impeccable service. Our server John was super helpful with walking us through the menu and even recommended a great bottle of wine to go with our meal. The only complaint I have about Johns service is my wife thought he was really cute! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ah, Vegas.  It's hard to find a good meal that isn't thousands of dollars.  Sushi Roku was probably our best meal on my latest trip.  The sushi selection is relatively small compared to other cities, but I guess you'd expect that in the middle of a desert?  I don't know...  But I went with the japanese short ribs appetizer for my meal because we didn't expect to eat a full meal.  It was so good I asked for a side of rice to soak up every bit of the juice/sauce that it was with.  The rolls my dining parter had were good, too.

The service was OK - not incredibly attentive but not bad either.  I imagine on a busy night (there were only a few people at the time) it could get slow."}
{"text":"I love sushi!  I am also picky about my sushi.  Sushi Roku does it beautifully.  The fish was melt in your mouth delicious and the service attentive and helpful.  We had the katana roll - great mix of fish and you could add/remove as much of the spicy mixture as you like, a salmon sashimi special with yuzu foam - nice balance of flavor although slivered radish was a little strong for the delicate fish, a couple of hand rolls - the California had sweet mild Alaskan crab and the eel sauce on the unagi  was top notch. I love uni, and this met my expectations of fresh sea goodness.  The dessert of banana flambé was a huge wonderful surprise.  I am not a dessert person, but my nephew was there and he ordered this dish.  I had two bites before he finished it and OMG!  No flames at the table, but his spoon was on fire as he dug in!  Go here instead of Nobu when in Vegas if interested in creative sushi."}
{"text":"This place is located in the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace.  The closest entry point from outside the hotel is via the valet parking (actually free, but tip req'd) at the forum shops.  We got there earlier than our reservation (a Sunday) and they were able to accomodate us.  We got a table w/ a great view of the strip looking southbound.  Very sleek, modern interior, dark, loud modern music.  We ordered: eggplant app (yummy), pork korubata (good but fatty and not for sharing), seaweed salad, kobe beef and scallop app (beef was too chewy), california roll, unagi avocado roll, and the chicken entree (a bit dry).  The rolls were alright, nothing elaborate for their pricepoint, perhaps the nigiri/sashimi would have been better?  They had a nice assortment of small plates that we should have stuck with."}
{"text":"Wow. Where do I begin? For a place so chic and modern, you'd think you'd be getting a pretty good meal. 

Restaurants should NOT be comping you or sending you food because they can't deliver what you actually ordered in time. Plus, I don't want your shitty stir fry shrimp that tastes like it's from Panda Express because you're service is so slow. The lunch special sashimi with chicken and salad is a joke. The chicken was overcooked, and the salad was pathetic. I really wanted to be a bitch and send it back, but I always thought I'd just suck it up and never come back. I really worry that they think they food they're putting out is acceptable. The sashimi salad was alright, but the portion was ridiculously small. I tasted the rest of the sushi that the rest of the party had, and it was mediocre at best. 

Come here if you're a \"gringo\" and don't care and just want some California rolls and a good view. Don't come here if you're expecting quality sushi and service for the price you're paying. Seriously disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but pricy. Expected bento boxes to come with miso soup but it was extra. Sushi was very fresh but very small portions. Based on previous reviews expected a higher quality product. Would give another chance based on the great location, but there is better sushi in Vegas."}
{"text":"If you want to splurge, you certainly can here. The sushi was very good, but honestly not better than I've had in MUCH less expensive sushi joints. Our waiter was totally put out that we shared an appetizer and two rolls, instead of going with his suggestions. We just wanted something light! 
The rolls were good, the fish superb and fresh, but nothing to blow you away. We won't go back, not because of the price, it just wasn't at all memorable."}
{"text":"Short version: The food is good, but it is overpriced.  The profile should have 4 dollar signs.

I expected to be blown away by $25 rolls, but they didn't taste any better than rolls you can find at any local sushi joint in SoCal.  I didn't have anything that was worth more than $15.  If you don't each much sushi or sashimi then perhaps you will have your expectations exceeded.  I will not go there again.

Green Tea ice cream for $10, Sake sampler was $20.  Neither of them were any different than you will find anywhere else."}
{"text":"My friends and I had all purchased tickets for the W's New Year's Eve party and were really excited to have some sushi at the swanky sushi roku beforehand. Our server was amazing and we had a great night but sure enough two days after we have all be vomiting consistently. Although we cannot be positive our illnesses came from the restaurant we do know that we have not all shared a common meal at anywhere other than this restaurant. Will definitely not be returning. Very disappointed in what I had expected to be a top of the line sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by very average sushi. The rolls were smaller than the norm and overpriced for being such. You are paying for the lounge ambiance with an uncharismatic wait staff."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I went alone and was seated immediately. The waiter was super friendly and attentive. Not a good selection of veggie rolls but they were willing to accommodate! I opted for the Garden Roll and Miso Soup. It arrived almost immediately! The Garden Roll was $12 and came with six huge pieces. My only gripes are that they're too big to fit in your mouth AND the end pieces have huge pieces of Asian sprouts that there's no way you can eat them without taking them apart. (Which I did. Because they were delicious.) Overall very attentive staff and good food."}
{"text":"One of my fave stops whenever I'm in Vegas! Happy hour is the best! Yummy appetizers, and good drink prices & of course Saki! Nick our bartender was fun and friendly, he made our dining experience a cool one! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Vegas pricing.  To be expected.  I can't get over a certain expectation of quality when sushi reaches a certain cost per roll.  The ambiance is fantastic and the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"I love coming here. Not only do they have great ambiance and yummy food, but the service is great and that's what brings me back. Staff is always courteous and accommodating. The first time I decided to check this place out, I called in and talked to a woman named Julianna. She was so sweet and very inviting, offering to give me directions to the spot. When I came in, she greeted me and remembered me from our conversation on the phone. She also gave me DELICIOUS recommendations from the menu such as the rib-eye wrapped asparagus. I had a lot of questions about the menu and she had an answer for every one of them which impressed me. Julianna alone made my visit so great that I decided to keep coming back. She's my go-to gal at Sushi Roku and has even helped me coordinate a dinner for my friends and family. I love Sushi Roku!"}
{"text":"I have found you, best miso soup of my life (Country Miso Soup). If only we had more time to enjoy Sushi Roku! We ate here for a birthday dinner before a show but were unfortunately rushed to get to the show on time. The interior design is very zen and chic. We had a table with a view of the strip from Caesar's forum shops which was top notch. Our waitress Shaina was awesome, enthusiastic and helped us with back road directions to get to our show on time! I was under the weather so only had the soup and veggie tempura but as previously mentioned, this soup rocked. I didn't sample the sushi choices at the table but only heard good things. Our food was bit delayed coming out considering it was sushi, but upon investigation, Shaina found out the chefs were making the miso from scratch! The country miso had filet mignon to make the broth a bit heartier, hence the extra time apparently. Well worth the wait and they comped us a salmon carpaccio starter. Drinks were also tasty! I'd love to go back!"}
{"text":"The Uni was delicious! The service  supper and the experience I can't explain. I will recommend this play to any one. My last time there was many years ago and still the quality isA+ outstanding!"}
{"text":"first spot me and my gf decided to go when we arrived in vegas.  i was really dressed down, as a matter of fact the only person in the place dressed down.  But still, did the hostess have to look at me like i was a scrub?  cmon, you're a hostess in vegas, probably hoping some rich guy knocks you up.  anyways, the place was crackin, like most spots in vegas.  very nice, upscale place.  the food was great, the best salmon sashimi ive ever had.  i couldnt stop thinking about it 2 days later.  they set a new standard for myself when it comes to salmon.  id also reccomend the baked lobster.  prices are really steep, so if your taking someone here, i hope you get some action afterwards.  minus the snobby hostess, and i would have gave this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"First, I'll start out by saying I'm a big sushi fan and have made it that I have to try a new sushi spot each trip.  This time around my friend and I picked Sushi Roku for lunch on Christmas day.  Sushi Roku is located in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace third level right next to BOA Steakhouse.  We had reservations and once we got there was seated right away and the place is beautiful.  The decor was very nice which gave this place a great atmosphere.  The view was looking right down the strip which was very nice.  They get an A+ for the design and setup for this place.  The staff there was very friendly and helpful.  By no means the best service I've had but water and drinks were always filled.  Answered any questions we had when we asked.  First thing to know we had the Yellowtail at Social house at TI and have been looking for anything anywhere as good as there.  Nothing has lived up to it yet.  We started off with the Mixed Seafood & Vegetable Tempura and it was pretty good.  I've never had Tempura before so I can't compare to anything else.   Got the Yellowtail and I was very disappointed it just lacked much flavor and was not impressed.  I also ordered the Spicy tuna cut and this was some of the best Spicy tuna I've had.  Little Buddha was the best before I went to Sushi Roku.  The Spicy tuna was so fresh and just melted in your mouth.  Overall I would go back if I run out of sushi spots but still have Koi, Yellowtail, and Wazuzu to try in the near future.  The prices at Sushi Roku are on the high side and in my opinion not worth it per say.  For just the 2 pieces of Yellowtail and Spicy tuna it was 18.32 plus another 13.00 to split the tempura with my friend.  Overall a good spot to go but not the best sushi in Vegas."}
{"text":"Pricey but it's Vegas! The sushi was awesome, the waiter was very knowledge and had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Had dinner with five friends here a few days ago.  We're from Boston and trust me when I say we have good sushi.

This restaurant's strength is the ambiance.  The view of The Strip from the main window is great, and the decor is competitive with the best of them.  Music is new agey/lounge, but I know a lot about this genre and it could be a lot better.

The food was fairly good taste-wise when compared to other sushi restaurants in its price range.  However, it is more than a little overpriced considering the portion size.  You are literally getting mere morsels for $35-40.  When the waiter brought me my \"main dish\" it was something that looked size-wise like leftovers from someone else's meal.

Our total bill was in the $350 range and absolutely nobody had enough food.  In terms of taste, two out of six dishes failed to impress, one was mediocre, and three were good (including mine).

Overall, probably would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is the Best I have been too In a while. The seaweed salad was a hearty size and tasty. The Octopus special was to die for and I like the sashimi large slices. I might go back tonight so good and the sushi chefs very attentive."}
{"text":"Never before have I had such amazing sushi and incredible service! We will be back! I would say the only thing we didn't like was the music."}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh, fresh seafood!!!!!!!! My hubby and I are huge raw food eaters and every time we come to LV we always go to Roku! Service sometimes could be better, especially during the day when there are not too many people are dining but overall delish food is what we love! Sashimi is a must to try when you go there and I would skip the soy sauce all together to taste the true flavors! They have a great choice of saki too - skip the usual warm cheap stuff and go for exotic cold real deal saki."}
{"text":"Alex provided an exceptional service. he accommodated our group and made us feel welcome. I will highly recommend my friends and family to come see Alex specifically in the bar. I will be coming back specifically to see Alex W every time I'm in the area #liveyourbestlife"}
{"text":"Bug infested 

Sat at the sushi bar and all of the sudden 4 or 5 small bugs appeared all over the bar.  

Manager politely offer an apology but I was surprised to know that this is a known problem to them.   He explained that they been spraying 2 times a week but still have the problem.   They should shut the place down until problem is taken care of."}
{"text":"Several people from my conference raved about the food so I squeezed in a quick lunch this afternoon. Sat at sushi bar... Restaurant is really nice looking. Sushi chefs were very friendly. I got tuna and salmon sashimi and they were happy to explain the different types. The fish had very nice texture. The tuna was a little small, the salmon was perfectly sized and absolutely delicious. I also had a custom-made role since none of their specialty rolls included tuna. I think there were probably 10 pieces so a good size. All in all excellent but I walked out with a $70 bill eating by myself. Not complaining. Just sayin."}
{"text":"For what it cost, Sushi Roku was just okay.  Lunch for three of us ran nearly $250 (with no alcohol).  We ordered the mixed tempura, three of the signature rolls and three of the sashimi choices.  With just one sashimi selection costing nearly $40 and signature rolls hovering at $30 each, it didn't take long to run up the tab.

The sushi rolls fell apart way too easily.  The rice didn't have the right texture and there's no excuse for that at these prices.  The service was also spotty.  Again, not cool at these prices.

The decor is fine, but I am sure this place benefits from candlelight.  It was a bit dark and spare in the afternoon for lunch.  It also smelled like fish.  A sushi place that is this spendy shouldn't smell like fish.

Frankly, I think you can get better sushi for the money in Vegas."}
{"text":"I wish i could remember the bartender's name because he was awesome! Had great drink and dessert recommendations! Happy hour is a great deal - smaller portions, but still plenty of food! The chocolate filled mini donuts were great! Also the filet wrapped asparagus and garlic ponzu albacore were both amazing apps!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite sushi place in Vegas.  The quality of the seafood is top notch.  The tuna is melt in your mouth amazing.  Great place to try out a lot of different dishes.

Lots of gluten free options to choose from as well.  

The service is fantastic, and restaurant is located in Ceasar Forum and its relatively easy to get to."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku served an amazing lunch. The sushi chefs take great pride in what they serve. One of the preferred specialty rolls is the Baked Lobster. I also love roku because they offer Japanese A5 Wagyu in gyozas. A must try appetizer. The filet mignon skewers are also delicious."}
{"text":"A great place to make you feel like you're NOT in Vegas, and what a view from the dining room!  Although dinner can get expensive, it's worth it every once in a while; what's even better is the Happy Hour at the bar- delicious rolls and small appetizers for cheap; it's calm and the bartenders and waitstaff are friendly but not too talky, which is great.  Went there almost every day for two weeks straight on a business trip- totally worth it."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Such a neat location, overlooking the strip, and very kind servers/hostesses. The sushi was delicious and I would love to come back!"}
{"text":"If there is one place to eat in Las Vegas, it's Sushi Roku. It has great sushi and other items are available if you are not a Sushi person..."}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch our first day in Vegas. We both ordered sushi rolls (can't remember which ones). No draft beer and the sushi was just okay!  View of the strip and decent decor but not a great atmosphere. Probably won't go back!"}
{"text":"Environment slightly dark, very high class feel. The food was extremely expensive, so I was expecting some high quality food. Ordered some sushi, sashimi, maki rolls, and the salmon with scallops entree. I have to say, I was very dissapointed. The food was good, but no more than average, absolutely not worth te ridiculous prices. I've had WAY better, cheaper, elsewhere. But it's Vegas, so what do you expect? =p I would not go back here for the food because I could get the same quality other places, for AT LEAST half te price.  Total came to around $150+. only reason to go is environment, or if you want to spend a lot of money."}
{"text":"We consistently have great service, food and quality every time we visit. We have dinner here at the very least twice a year during our Vegas trips and recommend our sushi loving friends to head over there too when they are in Vegas. I am sure there are other places to go for sushi in Vegas but the location (in Caesar's Forum Shops and there is valet, right off of Las Vegas Blvd., so no mixing with all the other LVB traffic, cabs and hoypoloy!) Our latest visit was much of the same, great service, sushi and quality. They had a private event that took up most of the dining room, but opened up more seating and were able to seat our party of 4, maybe 15 minutes later but it was prime time dinner hour 7:30 pm and there is a Peter Lik gallery across the way so the wait was nominal. 

We ordered our staple crab miso, rolls and sushi. The wait staff was attentive and quick to fill waters, change plates and check on us. 

We had a great meal!"}
{"text":"Best Service and Sushi on the strip. And a great view from there dinging room!"}
{"text":"sorry but worst japanese food ever. 
I've eaten Japanese food so much
I could not even taste the food was delicious Japanese nor Chinese food.

Fortunately, the service good to give a star"}
{"text":"Location, Location, Location... the view from this Caesar's Forum Shop's Eatery is amazing.  I'm sure the sushi is fabulous (didn't personally order any) but the Ingen Chinese Style Green Beans and Garlic Sauce and their Chicken Kara-age served with a Cilantro Mayo Dipping Sauce was the sh%#!!!  Pair that with a Cucumber Infused Martini on the rocks... you will be on Cloud 9."}
{"text":"Perfect ambiance, ultra delicious portions, great service, on the expensive side, but totally worth it to whom who can afford and is interested in a higher end experience. (specially on the Vegas Strip!)"}
{"text":"Ambiance is great, but food and service is terrible. 

This restaurant is in the W, which is befitting since both are extremely trendy, modern, and classy. However, the service was extremely slow even though the restaurant was not crowded; instead, the waiters were busy flirting with the girls at the hostess stand. I was going to order more food, but got put off at having to wait over 10 minutes to get the waiter's attention.

This place is also extremely over priced. The fish inside the rolls were mushy - this just means that they take the leftover fish cuttings from the sashimi and mash it up to fill the rolls (you can see it in many of the pictures other reviewers have posted). At ~$10 a roll, I would expect much more. The Brussels sprout chips were very tasty and flavorful with the truffle oil addition, however they are deep fried and DRENCHED in oil (not truffle oil). The chef ought to let the oil drain off before serving as the sprouts were sitting in a pool of oil."}
{"text":"I'm IMPRESSED!  The view from this Sushi Roku is definitely amazing!  We squeezed our sushi run between a rough gambling sesh and a Boys II Men concert, giving us literally 45 minutes to get in and out of Sushi Roku.  Went with some heavy hitters so they were definitely 100% accommodating for us.  I dont think what we did would have flown well with the staff there... if it wasnt for the heavy hitters!

The service was impeccable and the meal was outstanding.  I cant get over the shiseido peppers.  I dont think I'll ever get tired of this dish!

Here's the one thing that throws me off -- this place is a million times better than nobu.  Why does nobu have its own... tower at Cesar's palace?  I dont get it!  We need a Roku Tower at the Bellagio!

I'd come back here in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Let me just cut to the chase... I wasn't impressed...

The restaurant is beautiful, but oh so noisy!  It's like trying to eat on the center divider of the 405 during rush hour.

The food was very hit or miss.. The Lychee martini was nasty, but the Lychee mojito was very good.

The shrimp dim sum appetizer was very good, but the sushi was very mediocre.  It made Todai seem delicious.

Service was VERY substandard.  Everything we ordered came out in the first 15-20 minutes instead of being properly paced throughout the evening.. and then we waited forever to find someone to bring the check.

And for the prices (almost $100 per person with tip), I'd expect everything to be perfect.

I don't see any reason to ever go here again.  Next time I'm in vegas I'll be trying one of the many other sushi restaurants in town and I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"The sushi was good (not great), so the fourth star is due to the ambiance and service.  It has a trendy feel while still being somewhat casual.  The elevated booth seating is fantastic and affords you a view of the strip.  

I recommend the Far East Mule if you're in the mood for a cocktail. I'm not normally a gin drinker and am definitely not a fan of sweet drinks, but this cocktail is smooth and delicious.  One or three will help make the night."}
{"text":"I've been dining here frequently for the last year and every experience has been great!!  If you're lucky enough to have Brian or CJ wait on you you're in for a treat!!  All of their recommendations were outstanding.  It is a perfect destination to take that special someone!!"}
{"text":"Our second time here was good, not great, not special. We won't go back for a full meal, just late night snack. 
Love the decor and the upscale modern feel. It's a great place for a date. We like to walk through the W Hotel entrance to enjoy the lounge scene. Another plus is going to the W pool deck to hang out and schmooze post sake
The food was expensive and good. To drop a couple of big bills and not be wowed is criminal. We had some winner dishes and the only real loser was some kind of steak skewer. 
Our server kept pointing us to the specials. We like to sit at the bar and watch the artistry of the food being prepared. We tried a number of times to encourage the chef to be creative with a particular item ie, sea eel to no avail. It was right off the \"special\" menu and very tasty but not an eye roller. Guess these specials are tried and true throughout the entire chain of sushi restaurants this group owns. Perhaps therein lies the problem, the CHAIN effect... cookie cutter sushi; good and satisfying, but not memorable."}
{"text":"Our new favorite sushi place in Vegas. Food is absolutely delicious. Not many sushi rolls to choose from but a lot of unique items and uniquely tasty combinations. Dimly lit, not overly loud suits for a client dinner or a date night. Fantastic views straight down the strip. 
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I can't believe I saw so many good reviews about this place.  The sushi was not fresh, the chef's special was downright disgusting and the prices were shockingly high.   Cost $47 for 5 pieces of sushi and miso soup - couldn't eat the rest on my plate - it was simply gross."}
{"text":"First night in Vegas and we were looking for something light to eat before hitting up the club.  Nobu was booked, so we decided to try Sushi Roku.  Reservations weren't hard to get and I had heard good things so it was a go.

We decided to order a bunch of appetizers and small plates to share for four guys.  One could't eat meat due to lent and I couldn't have carbs. Even with those restrictions we were successful in getting some tasty dishes.  

The Truffle Edamame was really tasteful, but you can't really go wrong when its sprinkled with truffle oil, yum!  Shishito peppers were okay, I've had better (at Nobu, haha).  

Yellowtail Diced Chilies were really fresh and tasty.  I good balance of flavors with a not too tangy sauce to compliment the delicate yellowtail flavore.

The highlight of the show was teh Chilean Seabass Truffle Miso Glaze!  Delicious.  I have never met a Miso Glaze I did not like, but add truffle to it, and I was in heaven.  Went perfect with the smooth like butter seabass (i kinda wish the black cod had the truffle miso glaze, but it was only described as Sweet Miso, so I passed).  

Other items we got were the Uni Tartlette (couldn't eat the pastry so just at the inside. Small, and flavor no so Uni-ish.  The sweet shrimp (Amaebi) was really fresh and the fried shrimp heads with it were the perfect compliment, Fresh and Fried.  

We also got rolls, but i didn't partake because of the rice.

All in all, Sushi Roku is pretty good.  Flavors really stood and were well balanced.  Service was excellent as to be expected.  Price was a bit on the high end for what it was but that's normal for Vegas.

I would come back (unless I have a reservation for Nobu)."}
{"text":"Not what one would expect for a Scottsdale restaurant. We had a large party (15) and made reservations far in advance. The staff was ill prepared to wait on a group of this size. Although we all arrived together, our entrees were all brought out at different times and two people never got their main entree. A few of us had the fried rice and it was very greasy and made one person sick to her stomach. We complained to the manager who comped us a bottle of champagne upstairs at Shade Lounge and also brought out some special desserts. Overall very disappointing and not worth the expense."}
{"text":"Delicious, delectable but pricey sushi with a great view of the strip.   Highlight: hand rolls - Eel Avocado and popcorn shrimp washed down with an Asahi draft"}
{"text":"The wait was a little long, but that's because I put in a special request for a booth. Since it was going to be longer, we request the first available. They created an adhoc table out in the front to accommodate which was unusual but great for last minute.  The food was excellent. Very tasty and even though the waitress said that kitchen was behind, came out in perfect tempo. The miso cod was exquisite, not new but cooked excellent. Loved the brussell sprouts and the sashimi was very fresh. Great evening spent."}
{"text":"Not happy. Staying at The Sanctuary and  called for delivery. Ordered $85 worth of food and received enough for 1 person. Called and was told \"we have the best sushi in town\". VERY overpriced and poor customer service."}
{"text":"Rob is the BEST!! 
Makes you feel at home. I never wanted to leave!
Was my first birthday meal here in Scottsdale....  UNBELIEVABLE fresh fish!! 
SO fucking delicious!!!!
This is my place now!!!!"}
{"text":"I love it !!!
The spicy tuna on crispy rice is yami yami
The service is fast and welcome"}
{"text":"Great sushi, but expensive!! Then again unless you're buying a hot dog for dinner, EVERYTHING in Vegas is expensive!! We loved our meal. We had salad, one cocktail, 1 spicy tuna roll and a bento box...are you ready? $100!! Yes. But worth every penny. Every dish was flavorful!! Worth it!!"}
{"text":"There are many things words to describe perfection.  In this case hands down amazing service from front door to the the AGM and GM.  This place will always treat you like a king and Queen. 5 out of 5  and everything above.  Thank you Gary and Sushi Roku for making our night even better than the last time.."}
{"text":"Wow, is all I can say, the priced are phenomenal cheap for happy hour, the well drinks,  only $5, for drinks that usually cost $15, the portions are small but to taste all the food it's delicious, we ordered the fried calamari,   delicious and lightly fried,  we ordered the popcorn shrimp,  first time they were not lightly fried as well...really yummy, but the best food was the mini doughnuts to die for, for only$3, tasted like Mochi, balls...will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Awesome i an extremely picky on sushi ant Roku is top notch. Service was great and manager made sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"I don't often give 5 stars, but Sushi Roku earned it tonight.  Delicious sushi in a very upscale setting. 

The Katana roll was very tasty,  expertly prepared and quick to my sushi bar seat. Perhaps marginally overpriced at $19.50, but includes three W hotel premium.  

Kimchee cucumber sunomono also very good,  although came out well after sushi.  But,  I'd rather have sushi out quickly so not too concerned.  

Pleasant desert choices from chocolate volcano cake to michi, to s'mores.  The frozen lemon souffle was delicious.  

 Esteban's service was attentive and engaging.  He definitely looks out for the customers and to provide a nice dining experience.  

Well done tonight."}
{"text":"My friend and I are visitors from California. I simply wanted sushi so I searched for sushi restaurants near our hotel and decided to check out this place cause the star rating wasn't bad and reviews were decent compared to other sushi places.

This place is fancyyy. It's connected to the W hotel and has a lounge as well. We went on a Friday night and the wait was 40 mins or so for an actual table. We went for the bar.

The staff at the bar were very helpful and knew they were behind due to the amount of customers, but were trying their best to get all the orders out as fast as possible. Their edamame had salt sprinked on it; I didn't mind cause it was something new. I tried some rolls here and they were good. Nothing exceptional.

I did try some fresh sushi for the first time (I usually just get rolls) and those were exceptional. My first time trying Toro and it was a great experience. It was so fresh and soft. Yellowtail was good as well. The Popcorn Shrimp Tempura was delicious. Warm, flavorful, and the gaze on it was just right.

Those who had a birthday received a special treat. There's a SURPRISE on that dessert! :)"}
{"text":"Elegant restaurant within the Caesar's Palace complex. The yellowtail diced chili appetizer was recommended by our waiter and was excellent. I also recommend the makoto roll - delicious!"}
{"text":"We had the tasting menu with a party of six. Paid about 250$ each person. Food was as good as what you can expect for the price segment so no complaint even though I've eaten much better for half the price.

However the service was terrible to the point where I complained and got pretty annoyed. 1. They switched the waiter for our table during our stay. Pretty much a no-go. 2. And that's much worse is they started bringing the next course to the table when some of us haven't even started the previous course so food stacked up on our table and we felt rushed."}
{"text":"Rushed service. Poor quality sushi and really mediocre food. One of the worst restaurant experiences that I ever had in Las Vegas and I go there at least three times a year.."}
{"text":"I went back to Sushi Roku for another bachelorette party and it was a complete 180 from my last review. They're having a great summer Happy Hour (even on weekends!) and we decided to be decadent and order one of everything. The sushi tasted fresh, the vegetable dishes - green beans, roasted eggplant - were flavorful and well cooked, and all of the meat dishes were great too. The cocktails were much better this time around, and cheaper, thanks to Happy Hour :) 

Our server was very friendly and fun, and even brought a complimentary round of champagne at the end of our meal to celebrate the bachelorette party. Sushi Roku totally won me over this time, I'm glad I gave it another shot."}
{"text":"J was dizzy from low blood sugar when we walked in. I was still stuffed from breakfast but I figured I'd have a nosh. She ordered a cornucopia of sushi (salmon, toro, one handroll with tempura shrimp and asparagus) that she devoured and was highly pleased with. I had the 'new' chicken salad and some mixed tempura (veg and seafood). Both were good but I really liked the chicken salad. The dressing is that sweet miso-y dressing you can some times get at some Japanese restaurants. 
   The service was really wonderful. Our waiter was highly attentive to our needs and my water glass wasn't allowed to be less than half full. We appreciated it.
   The price was pretty high for a couple of women on limited budgets. My salad was $16 and the tempura was $12. I have no idea how much J's platter o'sushi was but it wasn't for the faint of heart. But you are paying for quality, not quantity."}
{"text":"Great service!  Super clean and neat. Fast service! 
Delicious bar. The bartender was amazing. I got tipsy off one cocktail lol I'm not even a lightweight. 
Went here for my 21st bday and wedding reception. So amazing. Wonderful service. Wonderful people. Beautifully designed Asian fusion theme and soft music. Very relaxing time.  I will definitely be coming back another night. 
Excellent food! Everything was fresh and delicious. I expected to pay At least 1000. Bill was half that, plus tip. Got a hookup on champagne for my wedding :) 
So great! 
I guess the only thing people should know is portions are very tiny. Good for me cuz im teeny but not the hubby lol
For men you might end up hitting up a burger joint after but for the ladies it's perfect! I would definitely go again and again!"}
{"text":"Came in to the restaurant, seated, and given a wine list. No one came after that to take care of my order or even asked for my drink order. I was there for a bussiness trip but I was alone since my colleague left the day before. 15 minutes went by, NO ONE served me water or even asked me my order, not even gave me a dinner menu (I had to ask myself, even so, no one took care of my order, even after I tried to catch their attention).  A group of 4 people came in. A waiter IMMEDIATELY asked for their drink order!!! Is one person bussiness not as important as 4 people? Is this how you treat your customer? My night was ruined and I was disappointed! I told the ladies at the front desk about it and they said \"really?\" as if they did not believe me. I left the restaurant because I felt that I was treated unfair and that my business was not important. Who wants to eat their food after that? I work for a large coorporate company and I don't recommend your restaurant at all to my colleagues, an yes, we do a lot of of business in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Have been to Sushi Roku a couple times.. Both times the Food was GREAT the Staff Was Great... For years I have just driven by, now that I know this is an awesome establishment, I will absolutely be stopping by more often.  If you have never been, you need to check this one out.  For Real!"}
{"text":"Came here with my fellow Yelper Miss Lisa E, and very much enjoyed this upscale, fun, trendy restaurant.  Located within the W Hotel, makes a great spot for happy hour with friends, or a date night. The way the food is prepared, makes typically \"scary\" sushi a lot less intimidating for sushi rookies like me who don't typically eat things like octopus, eel, etc.  Everything I tried was quite delicious. I would suggest the fillet wrapped asparagus, and pretty much any of the rolls. The service was impeccable, its almost as if they knew we Yelpers, but seems like they are just that good! Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch while shopping in the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace.  

We ordered sushi: salmon, tuna, albacore, unagi, spanish mackerel, kanpachi, yellowtail and special rolls: rock shrimp tempura with jalapeno, spicy scallop roll and a Katana roll.  Honestly, there was really nothing that blew me away.  The menu items all sounded awesome but when it arrived to the table I was quite disappointed.  The portions and cuts of sushi were smaller than I'm used to and the quality of the fish was fair.  

Don't get me wrong, the restaurant is beautiful and the service is impeccable.  But it you are dropping $150+ for lunch, you should expect the food to be way better.  

I should offer up another star for our waiter.  I burned my hand on my flat iron that morning and he let me use their burn spray from the kitchen.  That was nice of him to do.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Sushi spot both in LA and in Vegas... Apparently you can get awesome Sushi ,reasonably priced in Las Vegas ,oh and great service !!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi and ramen on the strip. You can shop at the Forum and then do dinner. The food is excellent and the atmosphere is hip and clean.

Now considering it is on the Strip, there are tourists who can act like tourists. We saw a group yelling \"saki bomb\" and then made a mess, which the servers had to clean. I was embarrassed for them. I understand it is the Strip and would not hold it against this place. 

For us, the servers were friendly and helpful. One friend who does not do sushi, enjoyed other their tempura. This place has something for everyone."}
{"text":"Delicious!  There's one in LA that we used to go to, and the AZ one is just as good even though we're landlocked here!  Must gets are the:
  -Spicy tuna on crispy rice
  -Marinated Cod
  -Baked crab hand roll in soy paper"}
{"text":"We arrived a little before they opened at noon and sat outside the restaurant, inside the mall, for a bit. We were signaled when it was officially open. The waiter took our drink order and asked if we wanted to order edamame while we looked at the menu- loved that! I always forget.
We got salmon and tuna sashimi and two tolls. The shrimp roll with salmon and the eel. Despite dining in a dessert, the sushi was fresh and delicious. 
Tables along the wall gave one person a view outside of the strip. 
It was conveniently located in the Forum shops. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Stopped here for happy hour - I was a bit disappointed that we weren't allowed to sit near the windows with the views, but I get it. We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very nice and helpful! Drinks and sushi were really good! You gotta love those happy hour prices, too! It was a very relaxed atmosphere, and I'd love to come here again for actual dinner sometime!"}
{"text":"This place are boom I just love everything here the sushi are amazing will come back sure"}
{"text":"Great Food with Great Price point especially during Happy Hours. But all their food are delicious, fresh and nicely presented. A must try when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"It was busy here, but there were plenty of tables and only two of us. They sat us at the worst table for two located by the kitchen. Luckily, my husband spoke up and asked to sit near a window so we could enjoy the view. There were several vacant tables for two. Yes, we moved. We kept an eye on that original table; no one sat there while we were here. Hmmm...

I ordered the Katana ramen. I enjoyed it. The broth was smooth and milky. It had enough goodies inside although a little bit more pork would have made it better. To tell the truth I wanted ramen and this place was the closest. Another note, I'm a light eater, I think my husband could have eaten more ramen than what they served. I didn't finish mine, he finished the rest of my noodles. 

I also had the Makoto roll; it was nice, but not something I'd order again. 

I wanted to give this place three stars for wanting to sit us in the worst place especially because it wasn't busy. We were dressed casual, but nice. Others were dressed even more casual and had better seats. I want to be fair and not knock them down for first impressions. 

The hostess sitting us was very friendly and so was the waitress. This restaurant is expensive just like every other Vegas restaurant on the strip establishment. I'd be willing to come back if I want ramen and I don't want to move my car and drive someplace."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi/atmosphere in the forum shops at Caesars. The sushi was fresh and the very good. It's your standard high end sushi restaurant in Vegas. The prices are a little steep but what do you expect from a restaurant in the forum shops. A good place to take a date for a nice sushi dinner."}
{"text":"very good sushi cut fresh right in front of you.  had the yellow tai tuna roll which was awesome.  will go back there very soon"}
{"text":"Beautiful view of the strip.  Service was fast, but a little off putting in the haughty way.  We got the shimi roll, a rainbow roll (not on menu), wagyu beef potstickers and soft shell lobster roll.  Food was delish but not out of this world.  I regret not getting the tasting menu at $120.  Would have given 4 stars, but they messed up the bill and charged me several drinks that I did not order."}
{"text":"Dined here for Christmas dinner. In summary, good food but service was something to be desired. 

We made reservations via open table for 7:15. We checked in at 7:10 and were told it would be a few minutes before our table was ready. Within those few minutes, we were asked 3 different times if we had checked in. I'm unsure if this was a one-off because it was busy due to the holiday. In any case, we were seated closer to 7:30 and ordered right away as we knew exactly what we wanted. It was 7:45 before we got water for the table and 10 minutes later, we finally got the bottle of sake we had ordered. 

We ordered 2 ramens and only one came out so we had to wait another 15 minutes for the 2nd bowl. The sushi and sashimi were pretty good. In short, the kitchen and wait staff seemed overwhelmed and service was definitely lacking. 

3 stars for the food and the effort!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite sushi places in all of the state...the filet wrapped asparagus is amazing, spicy tuna on crispy rice cakes are great, all the sashimi rules, the baked crab roll...unlike anything I've ever had, delicious. They have awesome happy hour specials but beware its a very small inside bar, so get there early.  They have amazing mixologists and always have a nice seasonal drink menu."}
{"text":"Atmosphere to spare and a menu that will speak to everyone. If you can please both my wife (atmosphere) and me (food) you gone magical."}
{"text":"One of my first experiences going to an actual sushi restaurant. I was skeptical to go but it was a great time. The rolls we ordered were delicious. The Atmosphere was very satisfying and our server, Jon, was incredibly humble and nice. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately our experience here didn't go well. I'll start off by saying the ambiance and food is great and there is so much potential. The staff however very rude and degrading. First off in case your not used to it make sure you know they serve free tap water. Hostess makes it seem like regular water but charges saying it's bottled. Water had no ice and was not chilled if there wasn't a need for ice. 6$ water. The waitress made us feel like we were too poor after I asked for tap water and was not friendly. Staff stared at us after that repeatedly. Left feeling in a bad mood. Food is great. Go for sushi. Not the service."}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing and the staff was the greatest. It was a special event for my daughter and they treated her like a princess. The sushi was so fresh and it tasted amazing. I highly recommend it, if your down in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was recommended to go to Sushi Roku by one of the guys serving the big yardstick tropical drinks on the strip.  It is very chic looking, excellent decor and the sushi chefs are quite funny yelling out something in japanese whenever hot chicks come or go.  They were also very accomodating, allowing us to bring our large drinks in from outside.  The sushi was fantastic, excellent portions, very fresh and quite tasty.  I had the spicy tuna and dragon rolls and loved them.  Service was great and the manager came out and introduced himself which is always a nice touch."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch a couple times a month because our office is just across the street. I've tried just about every nigiri on the menu and it's always fresh and impeccably prepared. (The octopus was really tough once but that happens with octopus sometimes.) The lunch bento boxes are delicious as well.

The happy hour menu has a great selection of appetizers and drinks. My favorites are the chicken skewers, hanabi, and California hand rolls. 

Overall, I highly recommend Sushi Roku if you're looking for good sushi in the Phoenix area.  I'm from Vancouver where sushi is king, and Sushi Roku is one of the few Phoenix restaurants that comes close in comparison."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. We came here tonight for a birthday and to feel special/fancy and were not disappointed one bit on either front. The spicy udon was amazing, as were all the skewers we ordered. Will definitely be coming again!"}
{"text":"While the rolls were very good, the best aspect of this place is the service and hospitality. Certainly not what I expected inside a Vegas mall. The atmosphere and the decor was pristine and the staff tended to our needs well. The pricing is a little high, so if you're a sushi connoisseur I'd try something different each time before making a conclusion."}
{"text":"While the ambiance and general vibe is good I didn't care for the food. My eel was fishy tasting, most of the food was too salty, and the prices are a bit high for the quality of food. My friend loves this place and I know she enjoyed her food but mine was sub par compared to the same dishes at Sushi places in LA."}
{"text":"I must say this place was pretty awesome, from the decor, to the view of the strip, and the food was amazing, the chilean sea bass was rocking, all the rolls were delicious and even the cooked steak and asparagus was tasty, a must stop in Vegas if you love sushi, good service and cold beer."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the decor was beautiful.  The service was excellent and the prices were the typical Strip prices, expensive."}
{"text":"Happened upon Sushi Roko when looking for lunch options with my boyfriend. The modern, zen-like decor beckoned us in. This place is hip, right in the midst of the strip with sweet views. Our server was very nice and extremely helpful. Gave us a run down on the sushi and offered great recommendations. 

The sushi concoctions here are unique but a bit on the pricey side ($20-30/roll). We ordered the Katana Roll (spicy tuna and shrimp tempura on top of tuna and yellowtail), the Shima Roll and the Baked Lobster with Miso Sauce. The Shima Roll was excellent with a nice melding of flavors -- shrimp, spicy tuna, avocado and cilantro. The Katana Roll had a funky sauce drizzled on it -- not a big fan. My boyfriend loved the Lobster Roll -- generous pieces with a mouth-watering taste. 

Sushi Roko is a nice choice for couples, friends or large groups.  The atmosphere is fun, hip and elegant. Just be prepared for a big lunch/dinner tab. Our lunch bill topped $100 with no alcohol and I still had a little bit of an appetite when we left. Awesome sushi and vibe though!"}
{"text":"Ahhh.. I have fond memories of Sushi Roku in Las Vegas... =)  my girl friends and I came here for dinner during my Bachelorette weekend in Vegas. 

As good as the food was, the GM was the highlight of our meal.  Frankly put, the GM Kenji is a gentleman and a hottie patottie.  Whenever someone left to use the ladies room, he would come to our table, pick up their napkin, and put it nicely folded on the table... and then chat it up w/ us. hehe.  When we realized this, we started taking turns being the 'decoy' and he would come to our table every time without fail.  haha jk i'm exaggerating.. sorta ;)  ... 11 girls in Vegas need some form of entertainment at all times I suppose.

Anyway, on to the food:

Fav dishes:
Japanese Yellowtail Sashimi w/ Diced Chilies
Tuna Tataki Sashimi w/ Ponzu
Baked Lobster with Creamy Miso Sauce Roll
SeaBass w/ Truffle Miso Glaze & Sauteed Spinach
chocolate (volcano? lava?) cake

YUM YUM YUM.  

Oh yah, the latte there is excellent too!

I try to come here every time I'm in Sin City! (for the food of course *wink*)"}
{"text":"Expected an amazing experience... Was a bit let down. Sushi was ok - but not creative at all. Was trying not to compare, but the sushi at Virago in Nashville is leaps and bounds better (try the Ecuador roll!). Server was pushy and annoying. Was glad to get out of there and get to the \"Living Room\" at our hotel - the W Scottsdale where Sushi Roku resides.  

Tip: if you stay at the W you get a card for a free \"appetizer tasting\" at sushi roku. This ended up being just an amuse from the chef that they \"took off the bill\" because of the card we received - and after lots of questions about what we liked and didn't like - 2 meatballs came out as the amuse. That is NOT an appetizer tasting experience - it was an amuse - which in nashville means super cool thing a chef makes that is free and makes you happy. NOT the same at Sushi Roku. Left me disappointed."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE SUSHI IN TNE VALLEY. Dope happy hour pricing and EXCELLENT service. Stoked for half off everything this Thursday June 15!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now.  The first time, we had the kumamoto oysters and they were the smallest oysters I have ever seen.  I've had kumamotos elsewhere before and these were just very small. Had it again this weekend and same thing, very small oysters.  And they don't taste very fresh."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight for the International Sushi Day and have to say was very good. Had the edamame, shishito peppers, soft shell crab rolls, tuna tartare, fried rice, and wagu skewers. For it being International Sushi Day and half price would come again. My only wish was the sashimi octopus we had the first time we came. Hopefully next time. My girls even liked it overall. We will be back next time can make it to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch and dinner and it was fantastic both times. The space is hip and modern and the wait staff and manager were really friendly and helpful with recommendations. The omakase had a great mix of creative dishes and the sake selection was nice and diverse. From the cooked dishes to nigiri/sashimi and rolls, everything was fresh and well executed. Definitely get the pumpkin bread pudding to finish your meal."}
{"text":"Wish we had tried this restaurant for dinner instead of dashing in for breakfast.  It is conveniently located and promoted within W Hotel.  However, we did...

Other hotel guests were here, but the breakfast was just awful.  

Muffins laced with preservatives and sticky, like the ones you find at convenience stores.  Bacon stiff as a dead stiff.  Redneck toast - skinny, white, and tasteless.

Service was rushed and inattentive.  Except for the beautiful surroundings, this is a place that is unredeemable for American breakfast."}
{"text":"I am only giving this restaurant three stars for the exceptional waiter, without him this would be a two star review. Very small selection on the menu and mediocre quality of the sushi. My wife and I ended up just sharing a plate of chicken fried rice after trying 4 different rolls suggested by the waiter."}
{"text":"My First Sushi

the best ever... i was a bit nervous, I was a virgin to the cuisine... everyone new what to do with their towel & chopstick... I was a total newb... I caught on just fine though...The best  I've ever had...This place really ruined every place else, the chef was friendly & kind, will for sure be back, this time on a Business expense"}
{"text":"Writing this review on my mobile phone while sitting at the bar at Sushi Ruku in Las Vegas. Had a reservation, but as with the last 2 times I have been here, they are overbooked and there is a long wait.  I'm cool with waiting at the bar, but the bartender hasn't done anything but BS and serve the large group of girls at the end of the bar for the last 45 minutes.

Honestly, the sushi isn't spectacular and the location is tiny, but I wind up getting talked into going here more than I would like to.

This is the last time I am coming to the Vegas location of Sushi Roku."}
{"text":"From the time we got in till the time we left from the service to the meal...very impressed.."}
{"text":"The food and device was absolutely phenomenal! And Joy the bartender was top notch! She was amazing. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We went here New Year's Eve. Nice venue, on the third floor (?) Of the Forum Shops. We purposely made late reservations to stay in the restaurant to view the fireworks from the balcony. Full house, it took an hour to get our seats. We already had dinner so we didn't mind. We were asked if we would like an exclusive open bar option since we had to wait for so long. The majority of our party was nearly one shot wonders and passed on the kind offer. There was a live DJ. The restaurant had a good vibe to it. Despite the business, our server was very attentive.

We ordered a few desserts: creme brulee, fruit plate, ice cream/sherbet and a few drinks. They were out of creme brulee so the server gave us 2 banana flambes on the house. My sister and her bf wanted to try them so it turned out great. All the desserts were to our liking and presented beautifully.

Before midnight, the restaurant opened the balcony to show a direct view of the fireworks to be lit on the roof of Planet Hollywood. Champagne on the house was passed around for cheers. Countdown was amazing. We all had a wonderful time. We enjoyed the rest of the desserts and a few more drinks and left the restaurant around 1am. Nearly no traffic or any trouble getting out and escaping the strip.

A nice venue to celebrate New Year's Eve with your loved ones and to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"Following a friend's recommendations for Sushi Roku, we made dinner reservations for a Saturday night.  Being a self proclaimed sushi nazi, I was very hesitant about going to sushi roku.  I always have issues with going to chain sushi restaurants.  And I also knew a chef who worked at sushi roku...

When we walked in the decor was great, with a great view of the strip.  I ordered my usual list of sushi (uni, yellowtail, toro, albacore, hirame) as well as the Chilean sea bass.  My date ordered the Kobe steak.  

The sushi came out first.  We also ordered the special of the night: some special cut of Toro.  The sushi was bland...nothing spectacular.  I could not taste anything special about the Toro.  Very disappointing, considereing we paid $24 for 2 pieces of special Toro.  

My Chilean sea bass was cooked very well, flakey and melts in your mouth.  I didn't particularly like the sauce on my fish.  It was supposed to be a truffle miso glaze, but all i tasted was the pineapples of the glaze.  My date's steak came to us dry and well done when we ordered medium rare.  Already disappointed with our experience, I flagged down a waiter and sent the steak back to the kitchen.  The host and staff were very concern about the steak and immediately sent us a new, better cooked steak.  

If you do plan to go to Sushi Roku, stick to ordering rolls.  For service, Sushi Roku gets 5 stars.  But sigh....service and decor does not keep my belly happy."}
{"text":"Five star sushi all the way. Staff was very polite and server had great suggestions. Coconut Saki was delicious. Best part besides the sashimi was spicy pork belly fried rice."}
{"text":"We stopped in and split a sushi roll, and wow. That was the best sushi I have ever had in my entire life. my husband doesnt even like sushi and he hasnt stopped talking about this place. We loved sitting at the sushi bar too and watching the chefs. This is a great little spot"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend last week to see what its all about. Was good sushi but was limited in the spicy department. I was a little disappointed that they didnt have some spicier options. Overall was good and I loved the bartender. She was a realy great host and made sure we got all the specials. I will go again!"}
{"text":"We've got great sushi in the Bay Area and I was skeptical add there's not an ocean for hundreds of miles from Sushi Roku. But my cousin from North Cackalaki wanted sushi so wet went. It was UN. BE. The waitress recommended a few house specials which were unique and creative. Then we got some standard rolls and they blew my mind. My only complaint is that eating at Sushi Roku in Vegas has ruined sushi in the Bay Area for me."}
{"text":"Amazing place!  Staff was great, sushi was fresh and atmosphere was upbeat and had a great view of the strip.  Pricy, but worth the experience."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh sushi. The seared albacore sashimi with fried onions and garlic ponzu is a must have! The yellow tail and tuna sashimi were good too. Just a heads up that they put wasabi between the rice and fish here for their nagiri's, so if you're like me and don't like that, you might want to ask them not to put the wasabi. Overall great service and food. And a nice view of the strip when you sit by the window."}
{"text":"GET THE BRUSSELS SPROUTS CHIPS. They are SO good and I could have ordered 3 bowls of them as my dinner.  They were the highlight of my night.

We ordered TONS of food.  I usually love sushi but the rolls we ordered weren't too exciting. The Chilean Seabass and Grilled Salmon were phenomenal."}
{"text":"I was able to dine here for breakfast and lunch! The food was amazing and I would definitely go back again. In addition, the service was awesome! Victoria was our sever and she took care of us very well! Victoria made our dining experience amazing and will request her the next dine we time at Sushi Roku!"}
{"text":"Good service, amazing sushi

The miso soup is very flavorful and just a little salty, the eel avocado hand roll was delicious and the California hand roll had sweet crab.

The katana roll was a delight with yellow tail, tuna, tempura shrimp and salmon inside of it.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Sushi Roku. I not only dine at this one every chance I get but I also visit the Las Vegas location when I am there. The ambiance is great. The waitresses dress a little risque but it is Scottsdale and at the W. The food is amazing. We always order the Hanabi (spicy tuna, yellowtail (not on the menu but they will make it) and the pork belly. The octopus is also light and refreshing. We have had a lot of different things on the menu and are never disappointed. Since it is at the W the dress code is fairly fancy. They wont turn you away in shorts and a T-shirt I dont think but you will feel underdressed."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this particular location several times as the W is my go to hotel when I used to visit Phoenix and it's always been consistent. Now that I'm a Phoenix resident, I've decided to take advantage of their happy hour anytime I'm in the area. 

What I like most about this restaurant besides the delicious tasting sushi is that a business traveler can get in and out of this restaurant fairly quickly in between meetings. What I mean by that is if you're staying at the W and want breakfast, this restaurant converts to that. When it's time for lunch and dinner it turns into Sushi Roku. 

Staff is great here, always friendly. There are a variety of rolls and the best thing about the sushi here is that the portions are big and you never leave hungry. Try the Truffle Tempura, the tuna jalapeño and if you can't make up your mind just order the Chef's Special and you get a good variety of fresh and creatively prepared sushi. The key word here is fresh. Everything is delicious.

Little tip, if you aren't craving sushi and have a bigger budget, try the filet mignon. It's really yummy and at medium rare, it's prepared to perfection."}
{"text":"After staying in Las Vegas for a few days, we wanted to try something outside of the buffet line, so we turned to Yelp to help us find a nice sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. Sushi Roku came up with moderate views and we have been noticing quite a bit of advertisement for them around the Strip. Every sign we saw was promoting them as \"The most romantic spot in Las Vegas\". And Sushi Roku could have pass for the most romantic spot too. Their décor was fantastic and their tables near the window had an amazing view of the Strip.

However, the food was simply horrible, not to mention expensive. I know I am paying for the ambience so I wouldn't have mind if the food would have tasted half as good as it look, but it was barely edible. Everything felt dry and was seriously, lacking flavor. They didn't even use the Japanese short grain rice that is known for its stickiness. Instead, we were given a bowl of dry long grain, possibly day old rice. A small bite of the rice was more than I could handle and ended up finishing the meal without it.

Sushi Roku looks amazing and could be a very romantic spot to take your date to, just as long as you don't eat the food. Order some drinks or hot tea and enjoy the ambience and view.

{"text":"Really fantastic sushi, but the service is what sets this place apart. Everyone from the manager to the busboys were friendly and attentive.  Fantastic miso soup and spicy tuna rolls, in particular."}
{"text":"This elegant restaurant is located in the W hotel and its entrance was a bit hard to find at first, but just go into the valet area and the door is right there. 

My bf and I came here for dinner on a Friday night and it was amazing! Our server was very helpful and efficient. She was on top of things and gave wonderful recommendations. The restaurant manager even came out to make sure that we had everything we needed and that we were enjoying our meal. Really classy, Seriously, their sushi was some of the freshest I had ever had! We had an assortment of sashimi. The grilled salmon was my favorite. It came with mashed potatoes and hijiki seaweed. 

The creme brulee was to die for! The perfectly torched sugar gave a nice sticky crunchy bite to the creamy filling which was adorned with mixed berries. It was a pack of sweetness and tartness. Truly, a wonderful way to finish off an incredible dinner."}
{"text":"One of the best Asian fusion sushi bars I've been to (I liked it more than Ra for sure and even more than Koi actually) Super trendy environment, friendly staff, and A-mazing food! I had some kind of sashimi with truffle oil and spicy tuna with crispy rice. Would go back for a girls night or a date! 

The manager Steve was very attentive"}
{"text":"I had posted a review previously that was not meant for this restaurant. My friends all state this is a great place to go and fantastic food with excellent service."}
{"text":"Service here is first class, his knowledge of the menus was impressive and suggestions spot on.  Pricey but you will love every bit.  Love the decor such a gorgeous restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered the freshest fish from the sushi chef and it was amazing! Absolutely delicious. I suggest everyone order sushi that way, so you'll know you're getting the best. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Decent selection of good quality of fish for sushi or sashimi. AND their hakata ramen was very pleasant and appreciated surprise.  Good rich broth, firm noodles, green onions, and seaweed. The pork slices were about average."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Carmello was our server and was able to keep my whole bachelorette party of 9 happy! Loved him! The baked lobster roll is my absolute favorite at every Sushi Roku I've gone to and it didn't disappoint here. The servings are small and overpriced, but pretty typical for an upscale sushi restaurant. Loved my fireworks sparkler with dessert (on the house.. thanks Carmello!!)"}
{"text":"Good Izakaya and Sushi. Little on the pricey side for portion size. Party of 3 with no alcoholic drinks came out to $280 before tip."}
{"text":"Overall solid experience. We came for lunch & sat at the sushi bar. Restaurant & dining area were clean. Service was par. Was a bit pricey but we are in Vegas. We ordered the lobster tempura & a 4 sushi rolls. Enjoyed the food but with so many options to eat at I'd probably try somewhere else. I heard they have a good happy hour..."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal at Sushi Roku. The restaurant is beautiful and we were lucky to have been seated near the window, giving us a great Las Vegas strip view. We ordered a number of appetizers and rolls off of the happy hour menu and all were fabulous. The crispy rice and spicy tuna was a favorite of the group. The salads were great and the quality of the maki (rolls) was great. I ordered a few pieces of salmon sushi which were just good. To finish the meal I ordered two pieces of Oh Toro nigiri and it was amazing. The chef prepared the nigiri perfectly. Overall a fantastic restaurant and the price is right."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.We had a reservation for 530PM at this establishment, mainly because we couldn't have one for 5PM. It may seem early for sushi, but we had a show to go to and did not want to rush. We arrived a bit early hoping we could get seated a bit early but that was a hard stop. No way that you get seated before 530PM. I find it a little odd, but sure whatever. 

The place is very nice, and adjacent to one of the most awesome lounges in the city (the lounge of the W). It is a premium spot and they have turned it into a nice place. The service is good and on par, however we did feel that it was a massive up-selling from the waitress. She suggested very elaborate and large creations when it was clear that we already had our minds made up in what we were having. A bit pushy, not too bad.

The food was amazing. I mean I feel I know sushi, and this was very very well done. Every roll was distinct from each other and never did I feel it was vinegary or otherwise flawed. The only thing I found a little strange was that we were the first to sit, and the place was at low capacity and yet our food came out over a long period of time. Now we were all sharing and talking so no real issue, but imagine if someone truly only wanted something in particular... they might have had to wait until the end of the whole dinner.  

With that said, I will come back here though. It is a bit pricey, but for celebration or whatnot it is a very thorough experience and worth the cost."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here this past weekend.  The service was prompt and friendly and the food was incredible.  We all had a round of cocktails to start out and then ordered a ton of sushi.  I would highly recommend the Tuna Poke with wonton chips, it was a yummy appetizer.  We also tried a few different rolls and had AMAZING yellowtail sashimi.  I could've eaten the entire plate myself.  The only thing that wasn't great was the butterfish and I think it was just a personal preference.  

It was my birthday weekend and they generously let me pick a dessert of the menu.  I tried the donuts which were filled with ganache and had dipping sauces with them.  It was probably one of the better desserts I've eaten in Vegas.  They also brought out a huge obnoxious sparkler with it which was fun!"}
{"text":"I have tried many other Sushi Restaurants, but for my money, Sushi Roku has the best Sushi in the valley. Everything on their menu has a very unique freshness and high quality taste. Our server Rob, took the time time to really explain our menu. He made our dining experience very memorable, and we will be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"Awesome! Rainbow roll was delish. Sit at the bar, great service and atmosphere. Beautiful place."}
{"text":"I saw Bette Midler here!!! And she was wearing no make-up so it was hard to recognize her at first.  It was my friend's bday and her mom (and her mom's friend) flew us all to Vegas to celebrate!  We had a nice table, a little higher up than some of the others and who was sharing our little corner/section of private tables? Bette Midler and her friends! Her friends were giving us some dirty looks b/c we were staring/I think they could hear us asking each other if that was Bette Midler. 

Aside from that, our sushi was delicious! My friend and I shared the sake sampler and man that did the job. We were both pretty happy feeling and our sushi was so fresh, and so yummy! They service here was excellent, they really know how to provide upscale, quality customer service.  Our waiter was very friendly and got our food delivered fast.  One of the managers also came by to check on us and see how we were doing.  He was also taking care of Bette Midler's table, and after they left he was very friendly and polite in confirming that that was really her. 

Anyway, Sushi Roku, thanks for the great times and the great sake! I'll be back someday to try more!"}
{"text":"I love Sushi Roku, I've been to the one in Newport California and this one in Vegas. However, the one in Vegas did not meet my expectations. Being in the city of everything excessive I expected more but actually the portions were much smaller and not as good as I've had at the other location in Newport. The beef skewers and sea bass skewers were smaller and the Salmon carpaccio was skimped on the truffles. The picture I have shows Newport Fashion Island with the larger and cleaner cuts of truffles and Vegas has 2 nice cuts with a few shavings instead. The other difference was with the White Lotus roll, it didn't taste the same and the presentation was different because it did not have the crispy onions on top. I was expecting the same experience but so it was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Recently my husband & I returned to Vegas & made sure to eat again @Sushi Roku! It is absolutely delicious.
Tucked away @ Cesar's Palace. Endless menu & made to order. We prefer to sit @ sushi bar, engage chefs & watch them make our dinner right in front of us for a full experience. Sushi Roku will not disappoint. I do recommend making a reservation & maybe next time we'll check out Happy Hour, I read prices are great! Till next time Sushi Roku!"}
{"text":"To start, the atmosphere is definitely a 5. Well decorated and definitely buzzing. 

So why 2 stars you ask? Well here we go, We made a reservation for 2 for New Year's Eve some time ago and we were seated literally right at the entrance door at a high top table. Ok so still not a 2 star problem right, yeah it keeps going folks...we are down to 4 stars now. 

So second the food was good, not what I expected from a restaurant at a location as this. When it couldn't fit on the table, the waiting staff didn't make much effort to make room but rather just left plates angled on top of each other. I like to give solution and not just complain, so what I would do is maybe give a little more time between serving dishes or make efforts to make room for it so things aren't spilling. Ok so we are down to 3 stars.

Now here's the kicker...the drink order we put in as the first thing...never came...she didn't even come check on us once the entire time. On any day but especially nye, not acceptable.

So there you have it, 2 stars. Pick a better place or come here for the hustle and bustle and no cares about service."}
{"text":"Salmon sashimi was fishy and the hot sake was not very smooth.  Expected a lot better quality for Vegas Strip sushi."}
{"text":"Made reservations online for our 40th anniversary, and there was an area for special requests.  I asked for a nice table and asked if Chilean Sea Bass might be available (It used to be on the menu as an entrée, but no longer).  When we got there we were seated at a very nice table, and we were able to order the Sea Bass, with a Crab Dynamite sushi roll as an appetizer. Service was excellent, the food arrived much quicker than I would have expected, and it was delicious!  After they cleared our plates, the chef (I think) and waitress brought a very nice desert to our table with \"Happy Anniversary\" scripted in chocolate around the edge of the plate, and a little firework that shot sparks up for about 30 seconds, while the waitress took a picture for us. The manager also came by during the meal to make sure everything was as it should be.  We couldn't have been more pleased."}
{"text":"Top notch service all around! Food was all good but I can't say that I was truly blown away by any of it. Nothing to complain about at all if you're looking for good sushi and a good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I had the most AMAZING plate today at Sushi Roku. My server, Rob, recommended the tuna tartar with a yuzu guacamole. It melts in your mouth. The tuna was so fresh and the guacamole was nothing like I've ever tasted before. I highly recommend this dish and make sure you ask to sit in Rob's section."}
{"text":"I normally would give this type of restaurant 4 stars, but because of the fact that it's in Vegas and it was a Valentine's dinner, I will go all out and give it 5 stars! 

I had Sushi Roku as one of my bookmarks, and as I was sitting around waiting for my boyfriend, I realized that we didn't have reservations anywhere on Valentine's night. We had a show that night at the Caesars hotel, so I figured this would be perfect! I called and they took us in no problem. She did ask for my credit card to hold my reservation, but the machine was broken at the time. I wonder if they charge you if you don't show up..?

Anyway, it took us awhile to find this restaurant and I am pretty sure we went around and found every place you can eat at before we got to Sushi Roku. So for any future diners, the best thing to do just go through the Forum shops since it's located there, rather than the actual hotel. The atmosphere and decor is absolutely beautiful, from the lighting fixtures to the bathroom doors. We were sat at a table that had the view of the entire strip on one side and the other side looked out to Harrah's.. sooo cool! This is worth a visit just for the view alone!

The service was great but the food was even better... 

For the appetizer we got the Tuna Sashimi Carpaccio - I have never had anything like it before. It was delicious and so fresh that the tuna pieces just melt in your mouth. For our entrees, we split a few rolls:

-Makoto Roll - It's a spicy Yellow tail & Shrimp wrapped with seared tuna in a creamy spicy sauce. It's probably one of the best rolls I've ever tried in my life.

-Rainbow roll, Crunchy Spicy Tuna, and one more that I don't remember. Every roll was unbelievably fresh and done to perfection. 

For dessert, we both had cappuccino's and split a dessert - Raspberry bread pudding with Carmel... OH MY! 

This was definitely the best meal of the trip and a perfect place for a date!"}
{"text":"Ah... deliciously expensive. 

After watching the Beatles Love show, we swung by here thanks to yelp. It took me a while to decide what to order, everything sounded pretty good, but the dollar signs were going off in my head. I ended up ordering the hamachi with heirloom tomato and watermelon salad ($18). Delicious... came with some sort of pesto dressing and all ingredients worked well together. Then the A2 roll for $12, 6 pieces with albacore, onion, cucumber and jalapeno. Unfortunately, I couldn't taste the jalapeno, but it was a decent roll. Then finally the baked crab handroll for $9. I was expecting seaweed, but it came in some sort of soy wrapper instead and was more egg roll shaped. It was yummy though. Then $3 for hot tea on top of that. I can't say that I was full, but I was satisfied. Overall a good meal, just at a higher premium."}
{"text":"If I could add more stars I would! Ordered the caviar on scallops, Kumamoto oysters, toro andddd hamachi kama. Every single bite tasted like heaven. The oysters with an array of trio sauces, honestly, tasted like a beautiful piece if art on my pallet. Come here and order everything I did and you'll leave giddy! Oh and the honey whiskey/ginger ales help with that too! Johnny the main man is awesome too!"}
{"text":"This was hands down the best sushi I've ever had. The sushi was cut to perfection and melted in your mouth. No need for soy sauce as menu items were paired with sauce to complement the entree. Yellowtail carpaccio was EXCELLENT!  Service was great too which is important to me as it can ruin any dining experience.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"OMG. This place is phenomenal. Went there last night and it definitely did not disappoint. I LOVED the miso glazed popcorn shrimp. Do yourself a favor and order it! We had the beef wrapped asparagus, which was also great. Fried calamari was pretty good, but probably would not order next time just because there are so many other amazing things on the menu. Jalapeño and soft shell crab roll are AMAZING. We also had several pieces of sashimi, which were super fresh. Definitely one of my favorite dining experiences ever. It was extremely expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku (and the adjoining Scottsdale W Hotel) is the type of place that you either love or hate. It's a total scene, with well dressed, beautiful people jockeying for position and pulling every string they can to bypass the line, get seated immediately, etc. etc. So, my advice to people is to know what you're getting into.....go with the right mindset....and enjoy yourself, because it's quite a show! 

There are two different atmospheres to Roku, so you DO have a choice. The main dining room is fun, loud, and buzzing with activity. This is where all the action is. The only thing is, don't anticipate a deep, meaningful conversation with your dining companions. Yell some small talk, sip your drink, and enjoy the food!

The upstairs open patio is another story. While it definitely doesn't have the buzz of the main room, it is filled with large booths and tables, overlooking the W's pool deck. This is a MUCH more tranquil experience, allowing you to enjoy your conversation without straining or yelling. 

The food is very good. And, for what they charge, it should be. It took me back to the couple of times I've been to Nobu........some of the best sushi I've ever had......some of the largest dinner tabs I've ever had, as well. 

The appetizer selection is large and there are daily specials. On our last trip we tried a Tuna Tartar special, as well as their \"Hanabi\" Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice Cakes. Both are excellent. For dinner, we stuck to rolls, focusing on items such as Tako Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Katana Roll....all involving the adjective \"spicy\"....what can I say? We like it spicy. 

On a previous visit, some main courses hit the table. The Chilean Sea Bass was excellent, so don't be afraid to order off the Entree Menu if sushi isn't your thing. 

Lastly, the service is wonderful. We've been twice and everyone has been great to us. You are never left wondering where your server has gone and their GM, Seth, and the other managers are constantly making the rounds and ensuring that everything is to your liking. 

All in all, I'm a fan of Roku. Beautiful setting, beautiful people, and the option of submerging yourself into the scene downstairs, or enjoying a quieter meal on their new patio."}
{"text":"Dined here two years ago and haven't found a sushi place as good since. Friendly staff, yummy cocktails and tasty rolls.  He doesn't like sushi, so he got beef teriyaki.  The portion was small for the price, so stick to the rolls and tempura. It was the day after my bday and they gave me a complimentary dessert with a really cool sparkler in it...Vegas style, super flashy."}
{"text":"When going to this restaurant you need to know what to order to get the greatest experience, my friend of a friend was server and when I went I knew just what to order which was the... 
-Chilean Sea bass with Yuzu Butter Sauce (Amazing) 
-Yellow tail Sashimi with diced Chile's on top and Ponzu (Came out super fast and was really refreshing) 
-Lobster or Popcorn tempura, it comes in a sweet miso sauce which is to die for! ( I got the lobster) 
-Katana Roll (lots of fresh fish and tempura in it, it was large so we were able to share) 
-Shima Roll,( if you like spicy this roll is the way to go) 
-Salmon Carpaccio with Truffles ( anything with truffles and I'm in!) 
-Hanabi , which is spicy tuna on thees rice cakes ( takes a little while to come out but worth the wait) 
-Filet Mignon wrapped around asparagus it had a sweet sauce on top almost like teryiyaki but better (not a huge portion but perfect for an App with a couple people to share) 
-Banana Flambe, its on the dessert menu but the menu doesn't do it justice( i might come back for that alone!) 
So I went with 4 people and we all shared everything I think that was best way to go by far because we were all able to try so many different things, Oh and I cant write this review without mentioning the cocktails which were absolutely delicious ,my friend and i got the Tokyo Cooler and i could have drank about 10 of those! i will for sure be going back as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"Tofu was overrated but the wagyu on the hot rock was amazing! You can't get wrong with their fish and beef!"}
{"text":"Wow. I've been lucky enough to eat at some wonderful sushi restaurants where we live in NYC, LA and Vegas when we're visiting but I'm truly impressed by Sushi Roku! They have an inventive menu and an excellent staff to guide you through a unique experience in an unexpected place for such a different type of sushi meal - the forum shops at Caesars Palace. It needs to be said that my entire experience was 100% elevated by one of the best servers I've ever met - Maiko - thank you for taking the time to guide us through an extensive menu and helping us curate our order, personalizing it to us. I'm sure you had many tables but you made us feel like a priority - you made our night, thank you!!"}
{"text":"Don't miss this place if you like sushi.  Awesome quality and presentation.   Very fresh, from simple flavors, to more complex combinations.  Every time we come here it surpasses our expectations!  Looking forward to next time!!!!"}
{"text":"Very fresh sushi. Great variety on rolls with some unique takes. The waiters are always very friendly and give great suggestions. The cocktails were fantastic, freshly made and presented great. I've been here several times and have enjoyed everything I've ordered. This time we ordered the bento box with sashimi and shishito peppers. The sashimi was very fresh and we received 2 pieces of 3 different fish. The shishito peppers and a great sauce- they could have been a little more spicy. We also did the sushi lunch combination which offered a good variety of fish and the baked crab hand roll which came out nice and warm and melted in your mouth. Highly recommend for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"I've been to many Japanese Restaurant and I always get the chef's special and custom but this restaurant for me I guess this one has no talent at all.. the food is fine but the price doesn't fit to what I ordered, I got a boring plate of sushi ( 6 piece ) and a small bowl of miso soup and volcano chocolate  cake for dessert and it cost me $60 bucks plus $10 tip so total was $70 for one person and I'm still hungry and I only weight 96 pounds.
The name of the sushi I got was sushi UME it said in the menu \" Roku signature style sushi \"
\" our master sushi chef's custom creations \"  not even close to that. Money is not an issue for me but I feel like I'm stupid of paying something not even worth to pay for. I recommend to go to Mizumi or Sushi Samba"}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi establishment I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. The staff was unbelievably helpful. Our server, Max, was so knowledgable, my girlfriend and I didn't even have to order ourselves. He would bring is things to try and everything was amazing. Truly an experience I will never forget. I don't think I could ever go anywhere else after being so spoiled by the great staff and amazing sushi. Great job!!"}
{"text":"Nicely decorated restaurant. We were seated at a separate table as I requested in reservation. The makoto roll and spicy tuna roll were quite tasty. Also ordered the ramen and the pork finally didn't taste so fatty for once! The ramen I have had at other places had really fatty pork. For dessert, we ordered banana flambé and it was a nice finish for the dinner."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Generous drinks, celebrated a loved ones birthday! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So I went in with a couple of friends first time going we had $200 worth of gift certificates we had to use there ... being a local I never got to try this spot since I always just go to my local sushi spots but sushi roku impressed me! :) if you're looking for a sushi spot with a great ambiance and great view of the strip I recommend it ! My favorite was the rock shrimp I think that's what it's called omg and their rolls are to die for ! Also the shishito peppers wow! Yes def better than NOBU (no shade ) the waitress I wished I knew her name was a sweetheart and her  recommendations were on point , she knew what she was talking about ;) def sushi roku my new favorite sushi spot"}
{"text":"This place was good, but didn't meet our expectations.  The sushi rolls were just OK.  Service was fine.  View is good if you can get a window table.  My favorite was the kobi meatball lettuce cups.  Unfortunately, I'd have to say I would not go again."}
{"text":"Make a reservation in advance so you can just walk in....  We went there for a birthday celebration and they went out of their way to make it perfect.  Great service, fantastic food and a dessert with a flame thrower on top....seriously...

One thing I like about yelp is when I make a reservation, I can discretely use the comments to make a birthday dessert request, etc..."}
{"text":"Went here for the dinner the other night.  Sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed several pieces of very fresh sushi.  The Saba, Salmon, Hamachi and Halibut were very good.
The pieces could have been a bit bigger, but the quality of the fish was excellent.  Will have to try some of the other menu items next time, but wasn't really hungry since I had a big lunch earlier in the day."}
{"text":"Oh Sushi Roku, I really wanted to like you! I had heard such good things from friends and was so excited to finally try your sushi. But you definitely disappointed. 

I mean I do come from San Francisco, where you can find some of the most amazing, mind-blowing, met in your mouth sushi... so maybe I am biased. However I can name plenty of other sushi spots in Scottsdale where you can get bigger, tastier rolls for the same price or less (like Sushi Brokers, for example). 

Including our tip, the bill was about $150.... For two people!! We ordered miso soup, an appetizer, a bottle of wine (that was half off because of a Sunday special they had going on) and 4 rolls. Now I don't mind paying $75 per person if the food is outstanding, but these rolls were below average and I didn't leave feeling satisfied. Nothing to write home about.

Save your money and hit up Stingray or Geisha during their happy hour. Or, head on over to Sushi Brokers or Sushi on Shea in North Scottsdale but don't waste your $$$ at Sushi Roku. It's totally not worth the over priced menu!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat sushi, the beef asparagus was amazing, sea bass was the best I ever tasted highly recommend this place and our server Agnes was amazing she ordered our selection and my wife and grandaughter was enjoying every bite. I will be back. If you go here try the sea bass."}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming here for sashimi and Japanese beer.  Had a particularly great time with Giovanni as our server a couple of weekends ago.  None of us at the table knew anything about sake and Giovanni went to great lengths to walk us through it all.  The sushi is always great, but our server's attentiveness made a great start to our evening.  He even went so far as to offer to help us get tickets to a concert that was going on at the hotel that night."}
{"text":"We went to Sushi Roku on their 10th anniversary day for the special menu.

- Shima roll: shrimp wrapped spicy tuna, cilantro & avocado
- Katana roll: spicy tuna & shrimp tempura topped with tuna & yellowtail
- Filet Mignon-wrapped asparagus
- Popcorn shrimp tempura with spicy creamy sauce

A solid Americanized Sushi joint, priced high-end. Although it was good, I would say Katsuya and Nobu are better."}
{"text":"We sat at the sushi bar and were well entertained by the master sushi chef's there.
The Sushi and Sashimi was just so fresh expertly cut and well presented.
I enjoyed it so much I just had to try the Toro which was exceptional.
This is up there with Nobu and Morimoto as far as I am concerned."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi!! Very fresh fish. Loved the carpaccios and the yellow fin spicy roll.
Very friendly and attentive servers.
For dessert we had the mochi which are great! The strawberry one is delicious! 
Loved that they had champagne- elderflower cocktails, my current favorite!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to have great sushi in Vegas and I found it in Sushi Roku. The view at night is awesome. Service was great. Ambiance was on point. You must try the Kobe gyoza, unagi, and the green tea ice cream dessert. I haven't really tried a lot of sakes but the server hit the nail with his recommendation of the Sawanoi \"junmai ginjo\" sake. 

When I go back to Vegas I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Not the best, but still fresh and good. Good sake selection and fabulous lava cake. For being sushi, I didn't think the prices were horrible when you consider it is on the strip in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is another 2 star 4 star averaging out to 3 star type place.  

The 2 star stuff.... Don't get me wrong, the food was awesome.  But I walked out feeling like an idiot for paying what I did for what I got.  Eighteen bucks for spicy tuna with shrimp, cilantro, and avocado?  Ouch.  It did have 10 pieces, but they were the size of one of those budget happy hour California rolls you get for 3 or 4 bucks at a normal sushi place.  The baked lobster roll only had 6 pieces, barely fit for an appetizer (and the asparagus spear inside was about half of the volume of the interior of the roll). 

The 4 star stuff.... The view of the strip was pretty sweet, although it was predominated by the Caesar's Palace TV thing.  The decor was nice, very dark and trendy/classy.  The service was great, they were very attentive and even brought out some cheesecake for my friend's birthday.  The fish was very fresh (impressive, being in the middle of the dessert) and everything tasted very good.  Simple, elegant flavors with a lot of attention to presentation.  The sake selection was extensive and had a decently priced and very good house sake and a 3-sake tasting flight with big pours.  

The funny thing is, I'd come back.  It's hard to find good sushi and even though I felt pretty dang close to being ripped off, this was good sushi.  I'll probably try some other places nearby first.  Oh, and this would be a fantastic date place."}
{"text":"The bartender is so nice!  She gave me some helpful happy hour pointers.  Great service and food!

Miso blackend cod is the BEST thing on the menu!  I love it here- a Westside treasure!"}
{"text":"Really pleased with the food and service. The yellowtail sashimi was delicious as was the Valentine's Day lobster special. Also, not too ridiculously priced compared to other Vegas restaurants. Definitely recommend coming if you have a chance."}
{"text":"Update: minus one star. The lunch special changed and you now need to pay $3 extra for miso soup. They also forgot to put in my sisters order.  They don't have the dessert that I used to order.  Fried green tea ice cream is no longer on the menu."}
{"text":"We checked out Sushi Roku at the W for a fun night out with friends and sushi.

The restaurant was surprisingly quiet with an almost empty dining room. The dining room itself is serene and lovely and we were seated in a comfy half-moon banquette table perfect for our party of 4. 

Our server (whose name I am forgetting and I'm so mad at myself!) was excellent - she had a wonderful, fun personality and gave some great suggestions on items to order. 

One of our party is on a very strict diet and asked for vegetable sushi rolls. The server was initially hesitant about this as the way that they usually make vegetarian sushi is different than what my friend was requesting. However, she went to the sushi chef to see what could be done and he was kind enough to accommodate the request. Not only that, but the vegetarian sushi rolls were beautiful! 

We started with delicious yellowtail with ponzu sauce and chiles - it reminded me more of a carpaccio because the yellowtail was very thinly sliced and a bit scarce to find amongst the other elements of the dish. We also got an order of the shishito peppers, as they're usually a favorite of mine! Their shishitos were pretty good, but the ones toward the bottom of the bowl were somewhat greasy and were really overwhelmed by the soy garlic sauce they were prepared in. 

We began with Miso Soup (good, always a great comfort food) and then got a variety of sushi including the obligatory tuna, yellowtail, and salmon as well as scallop, a roll with eel, and a spicy tuna roll. We also ordered the teriyaki jidori chicken skewers, which was tasty. 

We got a few different desserts including the Chocolate Volcano (yummy, as to be expected of a molten chocolate cake pretty much anywhere) and the banana spring rolls, which were not much of a hit.

The floor manager stopped in to check on our table, which was a nice touch and something I always appreciate as we were able to let him know that our server was doing such a nice job.

Overall, service and ambiance were excellent and the food was just okay for the price."}
{"text":"Alex was amazing. His sake and whiskey knowledge exceeded expectations. I am very familiar with classes of sake and the bartender knew even more than I did."}
{"text":"The food was good but don't let them reccommend your Saki or just expect a very large bill. Certain things were very good others average but I have to agree very pricey but isn't most of the sushi places in Vegas?"}
{"text":"We ordered togo.  Blackened cod $28.  We arrived at our hotel room.  For &28, all we got is a tiny piece of cod- that is all. A piece of fish; no greens; no rice.  Just a tiny piece of fish."}
{"text":"You know how they say not to order fish in a steakhouse? Reverse that statement completely at Sushi Roku- despite being named for their traditional fish dishes, they do a damn good job with meats. Order a steak or at least try a meaty app if you visit, you won't be sorry. 

GET IT:
Tuna Tartare Phyllo Cups with yuzu guac and soy truffle- beautiful and delicious!
Brussels Sprout Chips with truffle oil- crispy and addictive.
Mushroom Tempura with Creamy Miso- so savory, great sauce.
Hanabi- spicy tuna on crispy rice. But only if you've never had it. I'm a fan.
Salmon Sashimi Carpaccio- this was the better sashimi app we tried.
Diablo Salmon- a daily special roll, served with an incredible honey soy sauce.
Wagyu Sliders- thick and meaty, get more than one because you won't want to share
Grilled Lamb Chops with Chimmichurri Sauce- two piece app, super juicy!
Prime Rib Eye Steak \"Japonais\" or Filet Mignon- you can't go wrong with either of these large orders of tender, flavorful meat, sided with garlic green beans and potatoes. 
DIY S'Mores OR Chocolate Lava Cake- I mean, if you have to do dessert, you can either go with a something fun or something reliably good. Don't expect both.

SKIP IT:
Yellowtail diced chilies- It's the same dish you can find anywhere else.
Seared Salmon Sashimi- the fresh was better
Roasted Cauliflower- a fail. 
Katana and Shima Rolls- pretty basic, actually.
Assorted Mochi, Bananas Foster, Pumpkin Spice Bread Pudding- one was unremarkable, one was a little weird, and one was served cold.

Presentation of all dishes was stellar but the service wasn't as attentive as the location and price point led me to expect. Being that it's in Ceasars and specializing in seafood, be prepared to shell out (pun intended!) for your meal. They've got a solid HH available daily from 4PM til 6 or 7, depending on the day."}
{"text":"Our group had a FABULOUS meal here. It was pretty easy to get reservations, even for our group of 14 people. We ended up splitting the table \"in half\" and have each side order their own food to share (family style). I think our side won:

For appetizers, we ordered:

Tuna Sashimi Carpaccio: 4 out of 5 stars
Yellowtail Diced Chilies with Olive Oil & Garlic Ponzu: 4 out of 5 stars
Organic Garden Salad with Yuzu Ginger Dressing: 5 out of 5 stars (as far as garden salads go)
Seaweed Salad with Cucumber Sunomono: 3 out of 5 stars
Shishito Japanese Peppers in Soy Garlic: 5 out of 5 stars (so much flavor!)
Brussel Sprouts with Bacon and Yuzu Kosho: 5 out of 5 stars (it's BACON!)

For Entrees and Special Rolls, we ordered:

Uni Udon Creamy Pasta: this was actually more like fettuccini, not udon noodles. It was definitely very creamy and heavy. I liked it, but I wouldn't say it was my favorite dish of the night. 3 out of 5 stars. Well, let's make it 4 out of 5 stars, since the uni pieces were huge.
Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus: it comes on a hot rock. 4 out of 5 stars.
Crunchy Spicy Tuna Roll (this is typically deep fried, but there is an option to just get the deep fried crunchy flakes on top of the roll). 4 out of 5 stars.
Katana Roll: Spicy tuna & shrimp tempura topped with tuna and yellowtail. 5 out of 5 stars.
Makoto Roll: Yellowtail & shrimp tempura wrapped with seared tuna, spicy creamy sauce. 5 out of 5 stars. These rolls were pretty similar actually...oops.

The other side ordered the Prime Rib Eye Steak to share, and we each tried a piece. If I go with a large group again, we are ordering that fosheezy."}
{"text":"Sundays have Happy Hour alllll day.  That means great drink and food specials just 50 feet away from the gorgeous W Hotel pool.  Great and quick service right in the heart of Old Town.  You can't beat that."}
{"text":"First of all...Yes it's a very expensive restaurnt, but it is sushi, you are in Old Town, and after you try the food you won't care.  The atmosphere is very modern and chic...it's really quite beautiful.  The service was impecable (Thank you, Logan).
We had so many things on the menu I'm not going to list them all, but the rolls were scrumptious, the asperagus wrapped steak was so delish, and my family had the spare ribs (unfortunately I couldn't try them) which they just drooled over!
Also, to mention, I am gluten intollerant and the waiter was very knowledged on what I could and could not have. I was able to eat almost everything we ordered, so it made my experience even that much better!
We had a great time and will definitely be back... Even with the cops showing up to arrest the half naked guy walking through the restaurant! Haha fun times!"}
{"text":"Went looking for a sushi joint in vegas, friend recommended the omakase (chef's special) for $95. It's a 6 course meal, but it was more like 6 bite meal. Altho fancy and each bite was tasty, we felt hungry when the dessert arrived. I personally wouldn't go back for the omakase, but maybe try something else."}
{"text":"Great sushi off the strip. Reasonable priced and overall a solid experience."}
{"text":"Creatively different sushi, with surprising combination of flavors and textures. All our orders came out great.Delicious fresh cocktails as well. Service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"I consider myself a sushi connoisseur and all around foodie.  This place was everything we hoped for and then some.  The vibe is ultra hip Vegas, inside of Caesars on the third floor of the Forum Shops.

We get there for our 9:30p reservations and promptly sat at a wonderful table with a view.  We wanted for nothing and the service was magnificant.  

We had the Sparkling Blueberry Sake, amazing.  At $12 a shot we were a bit skeptical but it's so worth it.

We then ordered about 5 rolls in total but the two that stand out are, The Crab Dynamite, our FAVORITE and the baked lobster roll was a close second, just delectable.  

There is nothing that I would have changed about this restaurant or experience and really glad it was recommended to us."}
{"text":"WARNING!!! DO NOT ORDER THE CHEF'S OMAKASE MENU! 

My husband, cousin, and myself were staying at Caesar's Palace this past weekend and we were craving sushi. Since Sushi Roku was located inside the hotel, we decided that it would be convenient to go there. 

We decided to splurge a little and try the Chef's Omakase Menu ($90 per person). We were super excited. They even offered a complimentary glass of champagne which was so delicious.  

The meal started off strong. We were served a piece of halibut sashimi w/ shiso leaf & yuzu gelee, a piece of king crab w/ caviar, and a piece of seared toro with a piece of truffle on it. All three of us were in ahhhh. This alone deserves two stars. We immediately thought that if the first course was an indication of what was to come....we definitely were in for a treat.

Unfortunately...it was all down hill after wards. Our second course was a seared albacore salad. It was good, but nothing special. The third course was 4 pieces of red snapper sashimi (this was one of our least favorite dishes). The 4th course was a miso glazed halibut (so common). Then came the sushi course. I was expecting this  to be the best course, but it ended up being the worst. We were served Spicy Tuna Rolls topped with pieces of sashimi (kind of like a rainbow roll), and three pieces of sushi (toro, mackerel, and yellowtail). All of this was followed by a chocolate lava cake for the dessert. 

Our bill came out to $377 and it was a major disappointment. I've eaten at other Sushi Roku locations and they were good, but this meal just pissed me off. When someone orders an Omakase Menu....it pretty much represents what the restaurant has to offer. If I knew I was going to get Spicy Tuna Roll for $90, I would never had opted to splurge. 

Note: The rating that I give Sushi Roku is 2.5 stars. The half star is simply for the complimentary champagne that comes with the omakase menu."}
{"text":"This place was horrible! When we first got there the wait staff was a bit rude (not usual for vegas). There was plenty of seating but we were sat with a view of the mall, when asked to move they said the other part of the restaurant was closed but after we got our food they sat people by the windows?!?!? Didn't make any sense! This place was very over priced for such crappy food and service. I will never go back."}
{"text":"This place is a lot more fun whenever I come with my friends who once worked here.  It seem very serious when I come alone without my friends.   The chef don't smile as much, they don't crack jokes but the food is always good"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a beautiful dinner and a great time, Johnny Executive GM/Regional Director gave us an amazing experience! Definitely coming back, food was amazing! So worth the money. Thank you Johnny, and your staff for a wonderful service/experience."}
{"text":"order the omakase, it is well worth the price.
actually, compared to omakase at other high class sushi
restaurants like nobu and bar masa, it is quite reasonable
especially considering the quality and quantity of sushi.
the pacing of the tasting menu could use improvement, but
it was saturday night and very busy.
the eyecandy at the W does not hurt, either."}
{"text":"I cannot remember a better sushi experience.  One roll was OK (don't remember which one) but everything else was amazing.  Spicy sliced-sashimi tuna appetizer and fruit spring rolls for desserts were 'perfect' bookends.

On top of the food, cocktails, wine, the service and scenery were all top shelf.  Gotta go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic spicy tuna and pot stickers.

The sushi chefs were outstanding."}
{"text":"View - Amazing, Ambiance - Killer, People-Watching - Oh Yeah. 

Sushi...not quite five stars. We enjoyed our meal and the service was excellent, but I've had better sushi elsewhere. My biggest complaint was that I ordered a roll with jalapeno since I adore fresh jalapenos, and it tasted like celery. It had no flavor or spice, which didn't warrant the incredibly high price tag on this \"special\" roll. All it added was crunch. If I'm dropping over $20 on a roll, I think it should be perfect. 

In a lot of ways this place is five stars, but at the end of the day, it still comes down to the food, and very good doesn't qualify as amazing."}
{"text":"The sister and I took our parents to Vegas for their first time, and to also attend Paris By Night, a Vietnamese music production. They're not too crazy on trying strange things, and by strange--I mean anything that strays away from Vietnamese cuisine. They have traditional tastebuds, but still willing to try flavors closely related to their usual liking. This led me to choosing Japanese, because they've never tried much of it. Plus, I wanted to take them to a cool spot, which most trendy Japanese restaurants can accommodate to, to end their awesome day of music, and to make full use of their play-dressed-up night--dad in a suit, and mom in a purdeee dress. 

Service- 5!
- I called ahead to set reservation, and requested seating near the window to enjoy the view of the strip since it was my parents first time in Vegas--they were so nice and accommodating. I had to call back and change timing since the concert took much longer than anticipated; they were more than glad to meet our request.

As for the actual dining experience, our server was sweet and helpful. Took her advice on several dishes and it was on point. She even went along with me when I wanted to get my folks to take 2 plum sake shots [they're the one light drink only people]. She told my dad it was a 'pink juice shot', when he asked her what it was. LOL. Too bad I forgot her name, but I remember her a very small frame Japanese lady. On top of that, the manager [a korean fella] came to our table to greet and also at the end, to see how our dinner went. Very nice touch.

Ambience- 4
- The decor wasn't what I'd go 'WOW!' about, but it was definitely still an artistic and trendy architectural attempt. Great view of the strip, mellow, and warm. The way the restaurant was design, you actually don't need a window seat to have a glimpse of the streets down below.

Food- 4
- Our food was great, but the overall effect didn't leave me thinking, \"An amazing dinner!\"

Apps: 1) Yellowtail sashimi w diced chilies 2) mixed sashimi salad w ginger vinaigrette 3) agedashi tofu [it's off the menu, but can be requested] 4) Popcorn rock shrimp tempura in spicy miso glaze 5) miso cod 
- the yellowtail could have been fresher, but the sauce & toppings were delicious/ salad & sashimi was a great blend w the dressing/ soy sauce in the agedashi tofu was so little, but the tofu itself was soft and perfectly battered/popcorn rock shrimp ROCKED! SO DELICIOUSSSS. Much better than nobu's/ miso cod was tender, juicy & fresh, but could use a bit more glaze 

Entree: 1) Ribeye w/ soy garlic sauce 2) Chilean sea bass ( in yuzu butter, they have 2 different sea bass dishes, and both sauce are different]
- ribeye was yummy, had it medium but the little cooked part was quite dry. my folks and sister loved it and the baby green beans & potatoes that came along w it/ the seabass was perfectly flavored, but texture was a bit dry, perhaps an older piece of fish?

Dessert: mochi & a 10oz carafe of plum sake 
- no restaurant can possibly go wrong w mochi....and roku didn't. we were too fulll at the end to eat much dessert, so I figure this was an appropriate portion.

Overall, we all had a lovely evening. My parents had so much fun and enjoyed the restaurant's experience--along w the kirin light and cocktail I ordered for them [hehe]. I would definitely return, but not before I've tried other sushi joints in Vegas [can't help it, there is just too much to eat a one place twice in Vegas. unless you live there or go there 50 times a year!]"}
{"text":"I love Sushi and have tried many Sushi places in the area, but for some reason kept missing out on Sushi Roku...well, a nice gentleman decided to take me there for my birthday dinner and what a treat!!  We were seated at a cozy booth with a view of the sushi bar, which is perfect if you want an intimate dining experience but you want to observe the excitement of the sushi bar in action.  

Our waiter greeted us right away and he was outstanding throughout the whole evening!  Unfortunately I did not catch his name.  He told us about the Arizona Restaurant week menu and the alcohol and the 'real' menu...I had major conflicts of interest!  We ended up opting for a feast of a little bit of everything Hahah! We ordered two options on the AZ restaurant week menu because the variety of the options was impressive!  Seemed like a great way to try a bit of everything since we had never eaten there!  And I had to try one of the Signature rolls; when I go to Sushi places I like to try their 'specialty' or something weird and unique!  As for the drinks I ordered white wine (Citra Pinot Grigio, Italy) to go with the mounds of fish coming our way and my date opted for kirin Ichiban beer, and the AZ restaurant week menu surprised us with a complimentary Roku Fusion Cocktail!

The Breakdown: 

The signature roll we chose was the Tako Roll: Spicy Octopus; it was my FAVORITE thing of the night!  I find sometimes at sushi restaurants when they say spicy it is just more like a bit of a zing that you have to spice up with Wasabi, but Sushi Roku wasn't lying!  It came with spicy tuna dressing the top of the octopus roll and an interesting spicy reddish sauce drizzled across the top...Delicious!!! Great way to start the evening! 

1st course:  I chose 'Appetizers From the Sea' because I love fish, which came with Tuna Tataki, Salmon Sashimi and Tai Usuzukuri.  And my date chose 'Appetizers from the Farm' which entailed Kobe beef skewers, Fillet Mignon wrapped Asparagus, and Crispy Ji-Dori Chicken.  My favorites from each (yes we shared) were the Salmon Tataki, which had an amazing sauce (Truffle Tamari Soy) and the Kobe Beef Skewer (black pepper sauce)...my date liked the Tuna Tataki (close 2nd for me) and the asparagus wrapped with fillet Mignon (amazing).  We both decided we would forever pass on the Tai Usuzukuri (very blah) and the Crispy Ji-Dori chicken (over fried and just blah compared to the others).  

2nd course: I opted for the 5 pieces of Roku Signature Style Sushi (Tai, Yellowtail, Salmon, Albacore, Tuna), accompanied with 3 pieces of Spicy Salmon Cut Roll and 3 pieces of California Cut Roll.  It was all quite amazing and a great assortment!  I loved the albacore sashimi!  But it was all good because I love tuna in general!  My date ordered the Grilled sirloin steak \"Japonaise\" with Japanese style potatoes; it was a pleasant surprise because we both didn't know what to expect.  It was a big tender steak with a unique gingery sauce and the potatoes and green beans that accompanied it were also Delicious.  Both plates left the table empty!  

And yes still going: 3rd course:  DESSERT! The waiter brought out both the Mini Chocolate Volcano and a Fresh Fruit Sorbet!  They were both tasty but we could unfortunately barely eat them because we were so full!  The Sorbet tasted very fresh and fruity with beautiful fresh strawberries.  I love chocolate, so the Chocolate Volcano was decadently rich and wonderful, in which I dipped the fresh Strawberries from the other dessert; YUM! 

Oh and when the surprise Roku Fusion drink showed up we were amazed at such a great Restaurant Week deal for $30!  BTW they did not skimp on the alcohol ;)  If you ever want to try Sushi Roku, Arizona Restaurant Week is a great time to go because you get a great variety from the menu!  It was a wonderful experience for us when we were just expecting to try a few different rolls and drinks!!  I should also note the Tako Roll (spicy octopus) was not included with the Restaurant Week special.  

I know I will be back because their anniversary falls on the same day as my birthday (September 26th) and everything on the menu is half off!!! WooHoo!  

And one last thanks to my anonymous server!  I hope I get to enjoy your service again! As much as the sushi bar looks enjoyable and fun; I wouldn't have traded that for such an excellent dining experience!"}
{"text":"We stopped in because we wanted just a quick bite before going out for the evening and it was right there and seating was available.  The sushi itself was good, the limited menu options are very traditional. We sat at the sushi bar and were served quickly, which was fine with us because we needed to meet friends.  There was nothing special about the presentation it was just sushi and sushi quickly.  If you are looking to have a top quality Japanese meal in Vegas this probably isn't your place, but if you need to grab something quickly it fits the bill."}

My friend and I wanted to find a sushi place who offered a lunch course for Restaurant Week. We both never dined at Sushi Roku previously. It's located on the Strip side, 3rd floor of the Forum Shops. For Restaurant Week, they're offering a 3-course lunch for $30.12. We ordered each option. I've posted pictures of all our food.

For lunch:

1st Course:
Choice of: Spicy Tuna Hanabi (crispy rice cake) OR 
Seaweed Salad (cucumber sunomono, plum vinaigrette)

2nd Course:

Choice of: Sushi (tuna, yellowtail, salmon, albacore, whitefish, spicy tuna roll, miso soup) OR Grilled Petite Filet (homemade teriyaki sauce, steamed rice or mashed potatoes, miso soup)

3rd Course:
Choice of: Mini Chocolate Cake OR Fresh Fruit & Sorbet 

The appetizers were nothing spectacular, not even spicy. The sushi fish and miso soup did taste fresh. They didn't ask us how we wanted our filet cooked, it came to us medium-well. My friend didn't mind it, but I'm more of a medium-rare steak lover. Not only was I confused that a sushi place was serving mashed potatoes, they were pretty dry and ordinary. Spicy tuna roll was pretty standard. 

The chocolate cake was good, a bit too rich and dense for me. 

The tastiest thing was the mango sorbet. I'm not a big sorbet person, but this one was truly delicious. It wasn't mango-flavored. You could actually feel the strands of real mango in the sorbet. Best I've ever had. 

The presentation was great. The service was on point, from the hostess, bussers, our server, and the sushi chefs who greeted us hello and farewell.

I had a good time, it was one of those lunches where nothing went wrong, yet your tummy wasn't doing the happy dance when you left. The service and presentation, (and of course the sorbet!) made this 3-stars for me. I wonder if I would've had a better experience if I had come to order off the regular menu. Other than it being an opportunity to donate to charity, if Restaurant Week is a chance for establishments to show what they can offer, Sushi Roku didn't impress me that much..."}
{"text":"For an establishment as highly ranked as the W Scottsdale, I was very disappointed with the food at the pool and the breakfast both served from the Sushi Roku kitchen.  The food was unpalatable, over garnished with lettuce, and sub par for a restaurant anywhere.  When I returned my food I was told that they know that the \"huevo ranchero is bad, but you know how proud chefs are of their food...\" Huh! Interesting..."}
{"text":"After over 10 phone calls and over a month, Sushi roku corporate 310.271.6000, finally returned part of the charge. But please save your receipts folks. Had I not, I would have been screwed. 

Also, I agree that the food is very over salted. No need to sauce things so heavily if you have good fresh fish. Which might be the issue."}
{"text":"For a place that I have expected to be trendy with amazing food, this place falls flat.  

The cocktails were mediocre, and food was mediocre.  The only thing that was sort of OK was the atmosphere.  

We were first there for drinks, but later decided to have dinner.  The bartender that day didn't seem too happy and had a straight face the whole time.  He didn't try to make any kind of conversation and just made drinks and took our order.  Ok, I don't mind it too much because as long as he made great drinks and didn't mess up our orders I didn't mind.  The drinks as I said, were mediocre.  

We had a couple rolls and it was still mediocre, which was very disappointing.  I had hanabi with spicy tuna which I thought the flavors just didn't mesh well at all.  The tuna itself was amazing, but with the fried cube of sushi rice dipped in sweet soy sauce... it just doesn't fit.  The seaweed salad was a little bit on the salty side, and that it was nothing more special than the ones I can get from a Japanese market.  
I also had Shima roll, which was shrimp wrapped with spicy tuna, avocado, and cilantro.  It was not bad, but not good either. Just bland I guess.  Not impressed. 

Overall I thought with the price I paid I could have better sushi elsewhere.  If I wanted mediocre sushi I didn't have to come all the way to Vegas."}
{"text":"Pricey, but very good. There are very few restaurants that serve monkfish liver sushi. They made it very good. We also enjoyed the sashimi with ponzu sauce and the Sake!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday for lunch around 1pm. I felt underdressed and... um... out of place even though nobody was there except staff. Wait, this is Sunday afternoon, right?

My server was pretty good. He was very attentive and nice. Even when I wanted to order something special that wasn't on the menu he went and found out what they could do (I wanted a crunch roll, which they didn't have the little, round, crunchy bread things).

The sushi was average. The water was... questionable. It tasted like dirty tap water (and I say this as someone who has never even asked for a lemon in their water and grew up drinking well water and untreated water all his life). The couple that walked in later after us also commented on the water being off. So if you plan on drinking water, plan on drinking bottled water.

The place is pretty cool. I could see this being a banging spot to bring that hot date you've been hankering to impress. It is like two rooms both with very large, nice-looking bars. Who knows, maybe it is even a club at night. I could see that - this is Scottsdale, after all. And part of The W, also.

Prices were pretty high (+50$ for two people, no drinks, 4 rolls). 

And with that said, I feel like I'd rather come here and party than eat sushi. The hot GF agrees."}
{"text":"Very tasty sushi. Good service. If the amberjack sushi is on the menu I recommend ordering it!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Las Vegas! 

Wow!  Great service, food and atmosphere. Lisa the bartender was awesome!!! She made some great happy hour suggestions and you can tell the manager (Gary) cares about the dining experience of all the guests.  All locals are treated very well... Let them know.

Happy Hour is Monday - Thursday 4-7 and Friday - Sunday 4-6... 

The Lava cake is the best!"}
{"text":"The owner is very nice and the view is beautiful. I feel like I'm away somewhere ...so nice. Delicious food. Yum."}
{"text":"Fun sushi spot I try to hit everytime I'm in Vegas.  If you like sushi give this place a try."}
{"text":"Met my BFF for lunch during the week. We were practically the only ones there at the time, which is great. Sat by the window and had a view of the strip. I was starving so I just ordered a bunch of things. I LOVE the spicy tuna on crispy rice. In fact, we ordered a second serving. Sushi was fresh and excellent. Albacore in particular. 

Now remember we were pretty much the only people in the restaurant. So I have to say that the service was not the best. It wasn't horrible, but it was a bit slow and our server was MIA most of the meal. In fact, one of the items never came, but she didn't even notice. I brought it to her attention and said that we were full and to go ahead and cancel it. Her response was \"okay\". I'm not sure if she took it off the bill, I didn't check which is a very bad habit that I have. I will give them the benefit of a doubt and will say it was an off day. Other than that, I will go again. I would have given it 5 stars. 

Great food and great view."}
{"text":"food was delicious! sake all nite long!

our waitress was the best! 

pretty expensive."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Reasonably priced some expensive rolls some inexpensive. Bailey was a very sweet and friendly server. We had simple rolls, edamame and the ginger mojito. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great service, view of the strip and food! Must try the braised pork belly fried rice (forgot the name) but here's a picture!"}
{"text":"When we arrived, we were asked if we had a reservation. The restaurant was two thirds empty. The hostess said they were booked up, but if we waited a few minutes something might open up. There always an entire wall's worth of tables open. She let us know that a table had opened up.  I overheard the same pitch five times over the course of dinner. When we left, the empty wall of tables had one party and three empty tables. I hate fake exclusivity.

The food was good, the service was fine."}
{"text":"Used to live in LA and loved the Sushi Roku in SaMo but the Vegas location just didn't bring it. Great sake but all food was underwhelming, especially the Blue Fin Tuna sashimi that costs $15 for 2 pieces! Just low quality vibe"}
{"text":"We like to consider ourselves foodies. In our quest to merge a healthier lifestyle and our love of great food, we have been on a quest! Healthy, amazing, fresh and creative foods. This has lead us to many a sushi house. Avoiding the white rice ridden rolls, it has driven us away from the AYCE and towards the more expensive end of the spectrum, and of course the costlier (really a word?) strip. Being that we used to do a high price steakhouse about once a month and gone rolling out feeling nearly comatose from gorging ourselves, we have accepted this. Having said all that.... My other half and I have deemed that thus far Sushi Roku has the top slot for us. 
Food was amazing, waitstaff was; attentive, patient and above all VERY knowledgeable about their menu. Other places in town act as though they are doing you a favor waiting on you... The staff here explained how things were prepared, what types of oils were used, sauces, etc. We could adjust to fit our healthier lifestyle, but honestly once we were clear on what we wanted the waitstaff took care of everything! 
We did the Chef's tasting menu and what others are talking about on here I have no idea. This is not a Costco (bulk buying) type of sushi place. If that is what you are looking for this is not the place for you. Take time, ask questions. 
Sake flight was also fun. Loved that they served it with the information card. The hardest part of these things is remembering what you are drinking after they leave and trying to remember. It was served with an info card that aligned with the glasses so you could read about them while you drank, and the waitress paired each with a specific course. 
Sorry Tao, Social House, Little Buda, Nobu we have a new home. 
View also is amazing!! Gorgeous atmosphere. Hats off to the entire staff you should be very proud of your operation."}
{"text":"Ate here while watching spring training. It's a little pricey but the ambiance, service and food quality are worth the price. They have a great selection of drinks, sushi, entree dishes and desserts. If you enjoy good sushi and a quiet, casual but nice ambiance, you will enjoy this spot."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this sushi place. I am usually weary of overly expensive sushi places, because i'm in love with the AYCE options everywhere else in town....oink oink. We had gone for happy hour (Sunday4-7). It was so frakkin good. I think I literally might have tried every single appetizer on the menu and some even twice haha They had asparagus and crispy rice and popcorn rock shrimp! Everyone in the restaurant was also very nice and attentive to our needs. I swear I would only drink out of my water cup maybe once or twice, and they were already refilling my water haha

The waitress we had was named Ellen. Very cute and bubbly girl. She was very patient and kind in explaining all of the items for happy hour and in suggesting what she really likes. It was our friend's birthday, so she even had a little birthday dessert prepared - even though it was only happy hour! So cute and nice.

I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi meal I have ever had. Food was amazing, service was amazing, and the view of the strip can't be beat."}
{"text":"When I think of Sushi Roku, I am indifferent. 
You know... that feeling... the absence of any emotional reactions.

For me, the dining experience involves so many things. And usually that precedent is set from the moment you walk up to the hostess stand. WHY is this an undervalued position at most restaurants? PLEASE, Sushi Roku, do not put someone at the front desk that cannot seat people properly. After two strolls through the dining room while walking back to tables that weren't open...not once, but twice... I finally asked to just stand where I was until they could find me a seat. 

Maybe it was a bad night for them, who knows. But, if you read my reviews you'll see I'm an overly friendly yelper. The fact that I actually got irritated and let the hostess know I was frustrated speaks high volume.

Moving along, the food was great and the server was great. This wasn't my first time here. I've eaten here several times, including breakfast a few times. The

Dishes we had: 
Organic Garden Salad - Delicious!
Mixed Vegetable Tempura - Broccoli was the best
American Kobe Potsticker \"Gyoza\" - Loved
Baked Lobster Roll - MUST TRY!
Salmon Sashimi - Maybe wasn't feeling the sushi, just OK

And if you like pear, don't skip the Pear Martini! Garnished with Parmesan Cheese! Amazing flavor and plus a little antipasti bonus.

I've yet to have a full experience at Sushi Roku, but that doesn't mean I'll stop going. It might be one of those ongoing hit and miss situations - I just keep hitting the miss. Looking forward to the hit!"}
{"text":"Day 2 of my four day getaway in Vegas.  I try to eat at a good sushi restaurant wherever I visit and Sushi Roku was well rated everywhere.  I was not disappointed in my expectations.  I asked for a seat with a view of the strip and was obliged with a great view looking south down Las Vegas Blvd.  

I ordered the chef's tasting menu, a sake sampler, and a cocktail suggested by the waiter (muddled tangerine and cucumber with gin - Yummy!).  Each course in the tasting menu was brought out by one of the chef's and I was given an explanation of the food and its preparation.  

The appetizer course was amazing.  After two weeks it is hard to remember which each item was but I think the first item was a squid sashimi with olive oil and lemon.  The second item was a tuna tartar and the third item was a salmon sashimi.  Every item was sublime.

Course two was the hot appetizer.  This was a shrimp skewer with a mango salsa and a skewer with bacon wrapped cherry tomatoes.  Course three was a sashimi sampler with three types of tuna.  Beautiful presentation here.  Course four was perfectly seared scallop.  Course five was a sushi sampler with three pieces of tuna poke hand roll and 4 nigiri.  The salmon nigiri was the best salmon sushi I have ever tasted.  Course six was desert, a tiramisu with green tea infused lady fingers.  Heavenly.

Top rating in my book for service, view, ambiance, and most of all, the amazing food."}
{"text":"Made a reservation here on my most recent Vegas stay.  Place was highly recommended by a frequent Vegas visitor friend so made it a priority to come here.  We were seated at a table that had great view of the strip; more amazing when lists lit up at night.  

Started with some miso soup and seaweed salad along with sake; all were perfect.  Ordered the yellowtail diced chilies - unique dish with a great kick that complimented the yellowtail.   Next we moved onto the Katana and Tuna Japaleno; two dishes that went down so well.  To finish off, we went off the menu and ordered the gold truffle yellowtail.  This may be the best kept secret in Vegas - inside the yellowtail is some foie gras tucked in.  The sushi was heaven on earth; one of the best I've ever had.  Overall this is one of best sushi restaurants, period."}
{"text":"Roku sushi : 
Quality of the Fish:  3 *stars points
Service: 4 *
Interior: 3*
Organizations: 2*
Hygiene behind the sushi bar : 2*  (too unorganized should not be behind the bar)

For that price not worth ."}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday dinner last year. 
Restaurant had good decor but a bit too dark for me.
They DIDNT read on our reservation that it was my BIRTHDAY dinner so did not get anything for the occasion.
The food was good and the service was okay too. 
Was a good experience overall but wouldn't come again for that price."}
{"text":"This place is not as good as it gets, but it was sure as good as I wanted it at the moment. Late night, money lost downstairs at the casino, too tired to think where to eat and I stumble into this restaurant by accident. The host is the waiter and his name was a fabulous Paul. Paul sits me down at the sushi bar and the chef just stares at me. I was so hungry I didn't even think to ask for the OMAKASE ! What an idiot! The Omakase is $90 per person, but they serve so much that I saw people fall of the chair from being full. I don't even remember what I ordered, but I lost my balance after the first bite. Then I turned around to face the windows and THE VIEW!!! THE VIEW of my beloved las VEgas Blvd from the 3rd floor of Cesar's Palace with an orgasmic sushi in my mouth made my night.  Cesar's Palace curves at this point on the Blvd. and you end being sort of in the middle of it with bay view windows. I am flying there in two weeks to order the Omakase and I will update the review with details."}
{"text":"My favorite upscale sushi in scottsdale. The W hotel is beautiful and Roku is no different. The vibe is upbeat with trendy music playing in the background. Everyone in the restaurant is sexy and dressed to impress. Great date place or pre-party place in walking distance of many clubs nearby."}
{"text":"Once again - Sushi Roku does not disappoint. My favourite need a snack while shopping at The Forum shops. Located on the top floor it takes a little patience to find this quiet spot. Enjoyed their signature rolls - make sure to try the Katana and Sima rolls.  Our server was friendly and made sure everything was perfect for us."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi...amazing rolls. Their specialty rolls are where it's at. Get the one with the sriracha!!! (Sorry running a blank now on name of role). 
Yellow fin tuna sushi is perfection. Quite pricey, being at $50-ish for four pieces, but honestly so worth it. 
Took us a while to find this gem, but we're satisfied that we found it. Top floor of the ceaser's palace forum, take the escalator to top floor and you won't miss it. :)"}
{"text":"was here on labour day.  had my money stolen.  staff unhelpful; manager inexperienced and unprofessional; used to frequent often for the mediocre but reasonably priced happy hour menu.  will never return.  advise patrons to hold on to keep their bags close.  horrible experience.  try ra sushi instead for a decent happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Luckily we noticed that las vegas was having some type of restaurant week.  Kind of craving some japanese food and the choices for this place sounded great.  We had the dinner which included appetizers, main course and dessert.  Theme was hot and cold so since there was two of us we decided to try each one.

For cold appetizers we had a trio of salmon, albacore and tuna carpaccio.  Delicious especially the salmon.  Hot included sea bass, rib eye wrapped asparagus and tatsuta age chicken.  Also really good especially the sea bass.

Main course included a variety of sushi nigiri and a BAKED CRAB handroll which was amazing!! We ended up ordering more.  The other dish was filet mignon with mushrooms and garlic truffle oil.  It was good but that baked crab took the prize.

Dessert was a Yuzu creme brule with green tea ice cream along with a trio of flavors of mochi ice cream.   All in all the meal was great and Ill definitely have to come back again for the baked crab hand roll."}
{"text":"Amazingggggggg sushi!!!! By far the best I've ever had!!! The fish was sooo fresh ad melted like butter in my mouth!! View was amazing and ambience was great! Suchhh a clean and tasteful place!!"}
{"text":"I love Sushi Roku.  I have never had something that I didn't enjoy here.

My favorite: Yellowtail Sashimi w/ Diced Chilies $17 5/5

Popcorn Shrimp Tempura with Spicy Creamy Sauce. $17 5/5

The edamame is always a great way to get started

Local Secret...they offer a 20% locals discount with a valid Nevada Id."}
{"text":"I've been to Sushi Roku a handful of times and I LOVE IT! The restaurant is stunning, the staff is extremely friendly, and the food is absolutely delicious. The manager is AWESOME as well. I recommend this place to all of my friends and family."}
{"text":"Excellent. Staff, food, service, quality, freshness delish. Excellent prices."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. I had the Matsu 8 piece chef sushi custom and the grilled octopus. The sushi was fantastic. Each were custom made from the chef. The grilled octopus were too grilled for my liking and the price I expected a bigger portion."}
{"text":"Ok, I was wandering around Caesars Palace for snips and giggles and found myself on the top floor at Sushi Roku (which they have one out here in LA) and this place, though pricy, was what I expect from a great sushi restaurant. Friendly and quick service, happy customers (even sat next to some guests from Toyko, they were very nice) and the chef was top notch, he even gave me something on the house. I think business was slow so he was just warming up his knives. 

I shared a meal with myself and was very happy I did. When you're here for a month you try a little bit of every cuisine so expect more from me the whole month of April. 

But if you happen to come across this place it may be fancy, it may be pricey, but it's worth the extra 2 bucks on the rolls for the service and quality. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Solid \"meh.\" 

I think this place definitely gets a lot more hype than it deserves. 

Ambience = trendy and inviting 

Mixed drinks = delicious

Sushi = bland, nothing special, & pretty limited selection of specialty rolls compared to your average sushi restaurant

I had the crunchy spicy tuna roll and it was just ok. It tasted fresh, but overall pretty flavorless and the temperature was weirdly lukewarm. 

A friend ordered the Katana roll which was significantly better than the crunchy spicy tuna, so maybe it was that roll....

Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to return here."}
{"text":"the sushi here is good. the rolls are good but they are smaller than usual for rolls. the service here is kinda slow too. the prices here are really expensive. the rolls are over twenty bucks each and they are small. its super easy to rack up a bill of a few hundred dollars. although i liked the sushi, i dont think i will be back bc i thought it was really expensive for what i got."}
{"text":"OK, this place deserved 2.5 stars.

Sushi quality was very good:  4-5 stars.  Prices were obscene, though, even with that quality of fish.  Minus 1 star for that.

Service was lacking.  The place was nearly empty yet I had to wait a long time for everything.  Don't feed me piecemeal when there is NO ONE at the restaurant.  I sat at the sushi bar and had to wait for every pair of sushi to be served to me.  I'd like to pick what order I eat my fish.

Please know what fish you do have and don't have.  This is a sushi restaurant.  It's like a bell captain who has to stop and ask the blackjack dealer where the elevators are (...which happened at the Venetian, btw.  But I digress.)  Minus 2 stars. 

Yeah, overall, the experience was lacking.  Aka... sucked."}
{"text":"Get the lychee sake martini, blackened cod and sashimi.  Fresh and flavorful.  Good for groups.  The view was unexpected and a nice bonus."}
{"text":"I celebrated my 40th birthday here and everything was wonderful. From the event planning prior to the dinner (from a distance), the food, the service and the atmosphere it was five star. Thank you Johnny Seo (Executive GM/Regional Director) and the whole staff at Sushi Roku for making this a night to remember."}
{"text":"Omg this place has amazing food!!!! Can't wait to go back. Our friends were raving about how the tuna tartare is the best they ever had! I don't eat raw, but all the cooked food is sooo delish! Dinner with a view! Service was greaaaat. We ordered a total of 12 dishes. I'll try to update w/ more pics later"}
{"text":"The sashimi and skewers were incredible.  Also a big fan of yellowtail with jalapenos and ponzu.   Had several bottles of the most expensive nigori sake, which costs almost as much as our entire meal!"}
{"text":"The fish was great. The service was also recommendable. However, considering the size and other factors such as location, third floor of a mall, it was not a 5 stars."}
{"text":"I can honestly say, I have had sushi in a few Continents and I've never had anything as good as the Matsu at Las Vegas Sushi Roku. Simply the most delicious I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Three stars for the great service and chicken fried rice. The sushi had a horrible texture. The pieces were falling apart. 4/5 roles we ordered had no flavor. To say the least it was monochromatic and anticlimactic."}
{"text":"Really good food, and a cool atmosphere! Fast service, though the workers seemed a bit frantic. The bar also doesn't have normal options, only their specialty drinks. Luckily the bartender was really nice, and even though it was busy, when we told her what was in a Mai Thai, she was willing to make it. She also made a fantastic mojito!!!"}
{"text":"Hands Down a great fun place.
Great food on and fusion options for sushi.
Very posh, good service, but can be a tad slow on getting a drink ordered but overall great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is probably the best sushi I've eaten in quite some time. The fish was very fresh and reasonably priced. I had the chef's sushi lunch special, the seaweed salad and the Pinot Grigio. The decor was really nice too. 

The service was a little slow, but overall it was a great meal."}
{"text":"Hungry for Sushi we searched yelp n the net for a good sushi spot, when came upon this place.

will definitely not make it to my top sushi hit list. service was very slow and it took forever n a half to get out menu n the check. we sat at the sushi bar and we only got a few sushi rolls, though it was fresh i have to say it certainly was not memorable. we ordered the chefs sushi special where the sushi chefs choose the sushi. the place is very expensive so be prepared to empty your wallets for this one.

overall will probably not come back. definitely not for the sushi alone. but i heard the hot plates are good.... i guess."}
{"text":"Happy hour was a great deal. The sushi was really delicious and tasted fresh! They have great prices like $4 rolls and $5 cocktails during happy hour everyday if you sit at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and personable. This was one of our favorite meals during our stay in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and ambiance but overpriced. Then again, it's Vegas and everything is overpriced. 

Everyone in the group enjoyed their food. My fried rice and miso eggplant were delicious. We shared the creme brulee and mochi samplers for dessert, which were both decadent. 

I don't know what was in the food, but less than 15 minutes after the meal we were all hightailing it to the bathrooms. :P"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and it's a lot of hype. FIrst of all the steak restaurant or fine dining atmosphere does not work with a sushi theme. They are trying to be the Nobu of Scottsdale and it comes off as a sushi version of Mortons. No the atmosphere is not sexy; the W hotel is sexy, Sushi Roku is not! The service is definitely rushed and I certainly enjoyed my time more at Stingray than Sushi Roku. I like the variety of the menu but the execution is amateur. The food is good but incredibly overpiced. I certainly have no problem paying 200-300 for a meal but it better be good and honestly the sushi at Stingray, Ra and Kyoto is better than this place. The only nice thing about this restaurant is that it is located in the W. However, don't expect to receive any perks at the W for dining here. It may be connected to it but it doesn't get you upstairs or past the W hotel bouncers in the lounge adjacent to the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is one of my fave sushi restos eva!  The highlights are the Japanese bier selection and a place that serves ankimo (monkfish liver)  We had at least 4 servings of the sashimi version.  The rolls were amazing.  Don't worry about price as it's worth every penny.  Next time, i'm going to try the omakase menu as i'm sure it will be off the chain!"}
{"text":"While visiting Las Vegas, we popped in here for a quick lunch.  As typical for Vegas, everything was overpriced, but we'll let that slide.  We had a really tasty rock shrimp tempura roll with jalapeños.  It had a nice crunch and spice; we would definitely order that again.  The noodle dish we ordered was entirely forgettable though (so forgettable that I honestly don't even remember what it was!).  The service was courteous, but not engaging in any way.  Definitely okay for a quick bite, but not a place that is on my list to return to."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi bars in the Phoenix area! The fish is amazing, staff is extremely professional and friendly, and the atmosphere is upbeat yet comfortable. I highly recommend this spot, and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"first time here, was recommended by a friend! a lot of unique sushi choices... we order the Brussel sprouts chips for an appetizer which was perfect cause it was a good snack and not so fulling so you can enjoy your meal. I ordered the toro-jalepeno roll which was about 8 pieces.. I also ordered the spicy scallop hand roll.. I did expect the scallops to be fresh but it was cooked but still delicious! We also ordered the crispy shrimp appetizer which was sooooo good! my friend ordered the chicken fried rice and the rice was perfectly cooked and nice and soft! my friends got other rolls as well but I don't remember exactly what rolls but they said it was amazing! After words, we ordered cheesecake and mochi for dessert which was delicious as well! I would definitely come back when in town!"}
{"text":"After incurring sufficient gambling losses, getting the lunch combo seemed like the smart choice. Too bad it wasn't. I had the beef teriyaki and sashimi combo. While you get a good amount of food for the price, the quality was lacking. The meat was too chewy and gristley. The sashimi was OK and nothing spectacular to rave about. 

However, the a-la-carte items were phenomenal. My friend ordered the premium homemade tofu three ways, one with black truffle, one with caviar and lemon oil, and the last with scallion and sesame oil. Tofu was silky and smooth and almost hard to grab with your chopsticks as it would break into pieces when you grabbed a hold of it.

I ordered the chicken karaage with cilantro mayo. I enjoyed the light crispy coating surrounding the meaty pieces of chicken. The cilantro mayo was a nice condiment but I didn't notice the flavor of the cilantro too much despite the light green color of the mayo.

Service was good, except for the server for getting my order of Sprite so I had to ask for it again. At least she came by later and gave me a refill when I didn't ask for one.

Lesson learned this time, Sushi Roku. I'll be back to try more of your delicious a-la-carte items. Hopefully with more money to spend."}
{"text":"This place is a typical example of Vegas extravagance on the Strip. I opted for the Kobe \"American\" New York steak cut which is priced at over $50. Not sure how many ounces it ended up being but for not being the Japanese version, it was a very tender New York cut. Full of flavor, well seasoned, and a healthy side of varied mushrooms and green beans. You'll have to get your carbs from their various specialty sushi rolls or nigiri options.

Basic dessert menu, actually decided to skip it since it didn't stand out and the pricey entrée already made the dinner worthwhile.

Great ambiance and if you have the option, opt for the lounge seating instead of the normal tables.

5 stars for the awesomely flavored food and comfortable interior. Of course I could nit pick about the lackluster dessert options or opine about the lack of real Japanese Kobe beef, but the sushi, entrée, and appetizer menu is varied enough to include something for everyone."}
{"text":"Great sushi in Vegas..not a prime location, but if you go for happy hour (until 7 M-TH), the prices are super reasonable. I recommend the tuna tataki app, fried mushroom app, filet wrapped asparagus and spicy tuna roll. Note, you have to sit at the bar to get happy hour prices. Def give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Loved it.  Donald at the bar was awesome!!  Food was great.  Went for happy hour.  Great deal!  Great ambiance."}
{"text":"I love love love Sushi Roku!!!

Sushi Roku is the epitamy of first class sushi dining experience!  Our birthday party was seated immediately even though half of our party was five minutes behind us.  Our table had an AMAZING view of the Strip.  Our birthday party was greeted personally by the GM - Kenji.  Our server was attentive and our food came timingly.  Everything was good, not a complaint from our entire table.  

We LOVED our dinner and would go back anyday!  Tuna Carpaccio, Chilean Sea Bass, Ramen, Shima and Katana rolls were good.  I'd definitely recommend the molten chocolate cake for dessert... OMG it's to die for!  Overall a little pricy but definitely worth it for the ambiance, impeccable service and tasty food."}
{"text":"Loved this place!

Firstly, service and atmosphere make this restaurant very welcoming and comfortable. Great views of the strip, or cozy interior table with a modern decor. When you walk in, all the sushi chefs greet you ! 

Secondly, the food was ever so good. The best agedashi tofu I've had to date and somehow, they made simple avocado rolls just full of flavor. So good! Almost ordered seconds!..

My husband and I ordered a bunch of small plates to share - vegetable tempura, agedashi tofu, avocado rolls, and avocado & fried rice tartine. Considering that this is a sushi place, they had many good options for vegans! 

Everything was just amazing!!"}
{"text":"I thought Suski Roku was great.  It is way better than any hotel restaurant I've been to (except David Burke's Primehouse, of course).  

I had edamame, a california roll and a shima roll -- shrimp wrapped spicy tuna w/ cilantro and avocado.  They were both fresh and excellent.  The nice part was that I could see the sushi man actually making them about 25 feet away.  Nice!  I did think they needed more creative sushi rolls but was definitely happy with the two that I had.  

The place looks great.  Nice tables, booths, everything.  A little dark with the lack of lighting but I'm fine with that--I know my dad would have complained about how hard it is to read the menu.  

For hotel guests, I guess they serve non-Asian food here for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Were they out of their minds when they gave this place more than two stars?  Have they never had sushi before?  Have they nothing to compare it to?  Is this what desert dwellers consider good sushi?  Gag me!

Whose brilliant idea was it to place the sushi bar in the middle of the restaurant, and to seat every sushi bar patron with a loud greeting in Japanese as they were led to the bar as if they were royalty?  It was cute once or twice, but all of us sitting at our table by the entrance did not appreciate the fake sentiment by the end of our evening.  It was downright annoying.

While ordering, our server asked if we had ever been to Sushi Roku before in such a manner as to suggest that it was going to be a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience.  When he indicated that their food is served \"family style\" we initially thought that it meant that we would share dishes, which wouldn't work too well when five out of seven of us were vegetarians.  When he explained that it simply meant that the food is brought out as it is completed by the kitchen, I pointed out the fact that what he really meant is that the kitchen is not organized enough to assure that we will all eat at the same time.  This is unacceptable at a so-called high end restaurant.

I had to laugh at my vegetarian dinnermates.  They all ordered a tofu dish with what they called brown rice risotto.  After tasting the dish, which tasted like fried water, I understood why they thought the edamame was so good.  It's the only thing, other than the overpriced wine, that they actually tasted that night.

As for myself, I went for the sushi assortment, or should I say, the rice cakes with slivers of raw fish placed atop them.  I guess not enough raw fish survived the trek across the desert.  The fish was carefully rationed. I actually took one of the rice cakes and put all of my sushi on it to make a rainbow roll.

In the end, the server was right.  It was a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience for me.  Meaning, I'll never go back there."}
{"text":"The baked lobster rolls was amazing! We really liked everything we tried. Great food, great view. Service was a bit slow. They took a while to come by when we wanted to order more food. The view to the Strip was awesome."}
{"text":"Best crab sushi I've had. We enjoyed albacore sushi, a spicy yellowtail toll and a Philadelphia roll as well. It was all second to none. 
However, the edamame disappointed; it was undercooked. Ambiance is five stars. Server was super nice, although service was a little slow, but we were in no hurry. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service and food was very good.  We had three rolls and all were very tasty.  We recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is so good! Yum! Service here was wonderful and the quality of the food was great! Husband and I had a great time here for lunch. I will definitely be back here anytime I'm in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid sushi restaurant. A bit pricey, but the ambience is awesome. My boyfriend and I went last month, and our table wasn't ready until 20 min after our reservation. The bf wasn't exactly pleased as he had spent a lot of time planning the evening. The GM Steve was very gracious though, and brought us some amazing appetizers! Definitely helped to smooth things over. Everything we had was amazing. My favorite was probably the yellowtail appetizer!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and very friendly stuff. Happy hour menu is spectacular. Try miso eggplants and popcorn shrimp. Also tried the chef menu which was exceptional. Many years we were dining there and never were we disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok let me start by saying we eat alot of fresh sushi, we salt water fish, we have been to 4 countries eating sushi so this is an educated sushi review. We have noticed alot of sushi restaurants are Phillipino owned and operated however if the fish is DNA real and the knife is sharp we eat. 

A few years back we searched best sushi in vegas just to test the area. We figured VEGAS being VEGAS the who's who would eat sushi. I don't recall the name my wife found but it was behind an escalator down a hall across from a sports bar, it was a true hole. This place was unbelievable great. 6 years later we did same search as our daughter (9) loves sushi everyone and there mother has a sushi restaurant. 

My wife picked Roku. We sat down and it was a typical restaurant  other to flashy but sushi bar was awesome long and chef's were very visible. I scanned the menu and wow the prices were outrageously high like Toro was 26$, Halibut was 18$, saki by the glass Nigori super $$$ and it was a small glass. We decided to stay and try it is got Albacore, Halibut, Toro, seaweed salad, saki. The Toro was old and mushy, Halibut was tail ends and chewy if you know Halibut you would know this was awful and a cheap cut, the Albacore was very thin and almost white. My son got typical spicy tuna rolls and 1 lobster hand they were TINY. My wife well same. Daughter well same. Our bill usually runs 100 to 125 locally and we're treated like royalty I'm talking everything from desert being free to chef compliments in sushi. Roku was 345$. 

We were thinking wow like we didn't get the special water or anything. We watched another family gorge and fancy water for the kids and this roasted marshmallow desert. Another family looked to be locals sat. Started ordering and we thought man we must be cheap or over our heads nope. The waitress brought all kinds of fancy things and the mom said he'll no we drink tap water, get drunk before you come in, and order cheap. I asked her why just go to a different place she said they work near by. By the way we came here at 630 and the place was empty. When we left we talked to a guy that ate at the bar and he too said the most expensive fish he has ever ate.

So if your in the mood to look important and spend but get average fish this is the place."}
{"text":"What can i say but the truth a definite stop when we are in vegas right next to tommy bahama at the Cesar palace forums. Food is delicious and fresh try the katana rool and the shashimi all of them wont be disaapointed also shrimp fried rice is off the hook."}
{"text":"Went for lunch recently and the place was empty! So we ordered the chef's special, a combo of sashimi and rolls and it was alright. The spicy tuna had a strange, mushy texture-I was not a fan. We also ordered the shrimp tempura roll which was great. I may have been expecting too much; I was not impressed with this lunch. With two cocktails and tip it was over $80!! Ouch! I do not think I will return-there is better sushi out there for less money. Only go here if you want to over spend on sub-par sushi. The view was nice!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  They have awesome Oregon Four Graces Pinot Noir wine  and the cod is awesome.  For a real treat try the steak with a little charcoal grill at your table.  Great birthday celebration place as they provide fireworks and free deserts."}
{"text":"Wildly popular Sushi Roku is now in Scottsdale at the W Hotel.  It's atmosphere is ornate and blends organic textures setting the stage for 
freshly-prepared sushi and sashimi fare. 

The food goes beyond the expected and blends ingredients such as jalapeño peppers into more traditional Asian fare giving a unique touch to every dish. The bar serves up some wild concoctions that will surely cure what ails you, and there's a good selection of sakés and a creative wine list. 


Since I went to Sushi Roku last night without a reservation, my friend and I ponied up to the bar. We were greeted by a team of very knowledgeable and service oriented bartenders. Dylon offered some fantastic food recommendations. Oh, and ladies...he's total eye candy! He was very attentive and took care of us even as the bar got busier. 

Stephani cured my ailments with one of the most unique and delish martini's I've had in a long time! It was the Passion & Spice martini. It's made w/ Skyy Passion vodka, muddled jalapeno, orange juice and some other secret \"sauces\"!  Its sweet (but not overly sweet) w/ a slightly spicy finish. If I had a tail it would be wagging over this drink!  My friend had the Strawberry Fizz martini created with muddled fresh strawberries. Very summertime!! Caution: these drinks go down easy!  

The edamame hummus appetizer is refreshingly unique. It's made with black edamame and the beans are only vaguely darker, yet sweeter than the familiar green.  Their creamy, buttery texture easily adopts the flavor and spices of traditional chickpea hummus. It's served with 3 dipping chip varieties: fried won ton, lotus and sweet potato. Yum-O! 

I also indulged in the Filet Mignon wrapped jumbo asparagus w/ Soy Mirin Sauce (served tapas style) and the mixed veggie tempura.  The flavors were perfect and the drinks compliment these creative dishes. 

With it's critically acclaimed Modern Japanese fare and Zen-like atmosphere, Sushi Roku will be a favorite among both locals and visitors."}
{"text":"Lewis is an amazing server.  This was my fourth or fifth time here and this was my best experience. Lewis created a tasting menu for us that was bar none over the top delicious. We had the starter of yellowtail and ahi tuna tar tar followed by waygu steak wrapped asparagus and tempura shrimp (this was my least favorite). Then the lamb chop and sea bass skewers finished with a sushi combo of three of the top selling pieces. In conclusion, if you want an amazing experience with a server who knows the menu, see Lewis and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite sushi place for a while now. At least the one in Vegas and Katana in LA. The menu at this location is different and the fish didn't taste as fresh. But the service was great and the atmosphere was very hip and fun. I'd go again."}
{"text":"Maybe the worst sushi experience I have had minus the good company. First of all our meals did not arrive at the same time or even close. It took more than an hour to get sashimi. Two of our dishes did not arrive at all. When we asked our server to just cancel them, he remarked \"they didn't arrive?\" When we asked for our check we noted that we were charged for one of said dishes. I'm not one to ever complain about a meal but this was something I couldn't just let be. In all the service was better than the mediocre sushi we received. If you want great ambience, go for a drink just forget about eating."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku is tucked way out of sight at The Forum Shops at Caesar's. It is romantic and dark. Our server was very professional. We ordered a bunch of apps to start. 

The tuna carpaccio was fresh but lacked in flavor so I had to add soy sauce. The Kobe beef skewers were tender and juicy but I am not sure if they really were from Kobe. The chicken skewers were ok - afterall it is chicken. I recommend the Seaweed salad and Miso Eggplant Dengaku.

We were ready to order dinner and then a friend of mine got sick and left and her bf went after her. So my gf and I finished the apps and were full. We explained to the waiter that we had a problem with out friend and he understood but I felt bad for him since the place was almost empty.

One thing I noticed in a lot of Vegas restaurants is that they are so dark inside. It's draining. Liven up and be more fun, it'll increase business."}
{"text":"WOW! Have you ever tried Popcorn Shrimp?? one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten!! EVER!!! The beef teriaki was succulent, rich, juicy,rare...sublime basically! Eat the sushi here and you'll never be able to get cheap rubbish sushi ever again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sushi I've ever had!  Super fresh and creative rolls. My favorite is the jalapeño tuma roll! Fabulous view of the Strip too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good, decor was great, service was solid..BUT the price was silly! I expect to pay more in Vegas, but double...Other than that it would warrant four stars, but all things considered its a solid three."}
{"text":"Ok so I'll begin with the bad, cause baby- they ain't much good..... the drinks were not as strong as they should be for $14,(I had 3 of them and was not even buzzing- usually 2 and I ready to rumble) the sushi is great, but again you end up with $20 of it perperson just to have a decent sized dinner and the waitress totally but things on our bill that we didn't order AND the \"5 piece\" tempura order originally came w 3 pieces. All of this and the 5 oz of  so-so sake was $15. They should be ad they are new to the valley b/c in this  market they'll be a one-off place to go for people who can vacation. Plus this was all on my birthday, so they needed to do better. Plus you pay $8 for valet and they didn,t even pull the car around all the way. Eahhhhhh \"at the the sushi was good?\" Is not how I wanted to feel when the bill is over $120."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and even better food!! From the filets to the sushi. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was en route to Japan, when I flew over the W hotel in Scottsdale. I looked down and noticed a bunch of cool tables and booths located next to the sidewalk. I couldn't make out what the sign in front said because I was already at 2500 ft. and ascending. I asked the guy next to me if he knew, and he said \" I'm in the middle seat, I can only see wingtips you moron\".  So I made a mental note to myself  to find out which restaurant was located there. 2 weeks later, I had returned. I found out that it was Sushi Roku. I thought to myself, there's no way it could it be as good as the sushi I just had in Japan for the last 2 weeks. Well, Ive only been wrong 3 times in my life before the day I ate at Sushi Roku. Now I can honestly say Ive been wrong 4 times. I had no idea how fantastic everything is here. The decor blew me away from the get go. It's an interior designers heaven. Very modern and clean. I was floored by the warm greetings and smiles my wife and I received right as I walked in the door. Now then, there's sushi and then there's Sushi. The Toro sashimi I had was so fresh, I thought it was gonna swim right out of my mouth!! I mean Harrow!!!  Everything from the Filet Wrapped Asparagus to the Shima roll was fantastic. Ironically, our servers name was Ross too. Classic.  He was able to answer any questions we had, and he also suggested several menu items that we ended up ordering, which lead me to write this review. God he was impressive. Fantastic experience overall.  
I cant wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, friendly service! Nice atmosphere and sushi was fabulous. Spicy tuna roll and katana roll were both very good. We also had one of the chefs, Jason, make us something special and fresh and he nailed it! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"This restaurant truly deserves 5 stars. Let me start off by saying they have a GLUTEN FREE MENU, which is amazing for any sushi lover who can't have regular soy sauce and tempura. They have gluten free soy sauce and they have gluten free rolls which makes it really easy to order. The fish was so fresh and delicious. The ambience of the restaurant was very nice with the dimmed lighting, strip view, and great decor. I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that is looking for great sushi in Vegas for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Awful. Some of the worst sushi I have ever had. Maybe the happy hour menu is full of leftover sushi from the night before, but I'd rather eat grocery store sushi. Mushy and unappetizing. Thank goodness I didn't pay for the same items at $20 each. $50 I wasted at happy hour here. Never again. Worst sushi experience by far. Save your money and go somewhere else. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Come in here during CES w/ friend.  We were able to book it thru opentable the day before & got seated about 15 min after we got there with the busy crowd there, I say their time managment is very good! ^^

Seated at the Sushi bar, the chief was very friendly & so is the server.
We ask him the promotion I got from my AX card-$30 gift after $100 spend that expired just two days ago, they were still able to honor which was pretty cool, except we stuff it about $100 worth of sushi & Sappro to make to $100 bill. & it was so GOOD, & so Fresh for this sushi.

If you not much a sushi eatter, you can always try their other chain right next to it, BOA steakhouse, that is right next to it in the Ceaser Palace Form Shops."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best Sushi restaurants that I've visited in Las Vegas.  This service was absolutely phenomenal from the wait staff, bartenders and the chef going around and meeting everyone.  The atmosphere was cozy and intimate and although on a busy work dinner, we were still relaxed in this environment.  Also, you must try the dessert!!!"}
{"text":"Like many restaurants in Scottsdale, this is all style and no substance.  The food is good, but subpar for the prices paid.  I even returned a glass of wine because it simply was not worth the $10.00 cost.  And we did not think the menu was anything special or unique."}
{"text":"7/25: Located in Forum Shops at Caesars Palace casino. I looked up a site that lists sushi restaurants with Happy Hour available. This place was one of them and had a good rating as well, so I decided to give it a try. The food was pretty good, and most of the service was great. 

It was pretty quiet a little before 6PM on a Thursday, and I walked up to the front without a reservation. My friendly hostess promptly and politely sat me down in the bar dining area, although I requested to sit at the bar. Not sure if she misunderstood me or not. (FYI: it was pretty hot in that area; I'm not sure if the A/C was on...the bar was just right). A Happy Hour menu requested, which wasn't available in that area, so one of the waitstaff courteously moved my beverages to the bar. 

My bartender/waitress Lauren was awesome! She works pretty fast; there was an instance or two when I felt rushed, but that's better than slow service. She was very friendly and social, and we introduced each other as well. The rest of the staff was meh. Food was served in a reasonable amount of time, and the presentation was pretty cool. 

TIP: I was told that locals get 20% off regular menu prices! (double check on that before you go)

-Kobe Meatballs ($6)
-Fried Calamari ($4) 
-Spicy Yellowtail Roll ($5 cut)
-A2 Fusion Roll (albacore, onion, avocado & jalapeno...$5) 
-Eel & Avocado Roll ($5)...I'm a fan of unagi and this was fresh and delicious! 
-Mini Tropical Fruit Cheesecake ($3)...one of the best, if not the best, desserts I've ever had! They don't give you a huge slice, which can be a good thing. It's pretty sweet and rich, tastes like coconut with oreo crust. SO good! 
-Iced Tea was \"only\" $3.50 as well (I think it's usually $4+ on the Strip). Lauren even offered a full cup to go, which I accepted of course.

All of the food was great, although I wasn't expecting a couple of items to come in such small proportions (meatballs and calamari). Happy Hour might actually be more profitable in terms of cost/profit margin and bringing in customers; not just here, but at most places. 

Overall a pretty good experience. I have no doubt that I would be satisfied with the quality of the other appetizers. I'd come back again for \"Red Sun\" Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Recently visited the Forum Shops location for Happy Hour and what an awesome experience it was! They have their Red Sun Happy hour (Sun - Thur 4 - 7 and Fri & Sat 4 - 6). Happy Hour is served in their lounge area with bar seating and a long 'communal' table. There are some may great hot & cold items, drinks and even deserts! Gosh we had so much food! Some of the items included: Miso Glazed Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Scallop sushi roll (it's got a lil kick!), Shrimp Tempura with Asparagus roll, Shishito peppers, Crispy Chicken and Vegetable tempura. Most of the HH cocktails drinks I think were $6 each and the hot green tea was served nice and hot! Carmelo was our server - did a great job and to show how committed they are to great experience - Johnny the GM and Guillermo - Asst. GM stopped by several times to check on how things were going. As other reviewers have noted - beautiful floor to ceiling glass window that overlooks the Strip - amazing views to go along with the amazing cuisine and service. I think this is one of the best deals for Happy Hour on the Strip with all of the great choices and the fact it's offered 7 days a week. Of course their regular lunch & dinner offerings are just as great! Next time you're at the Forum Shops or looking for a great experience - check it out! A MUST! ENJOY! ;-)"}
{"text":"If you want to have true traditional Japanese sushi/sashimi, this place is not a right place for you.  I felt food was overpriced and food was average.  If your boyfriend take you there and enjoy upscale/romantic atmosphere, it's a right place.  Service was good and their restroom is very unique. When I walked into the restroom, I thought I was drunk after a glass of sake. But the washing hands sinks are located between men/women's restroom.  A very kind gentleman indicated to me the women's restroom. Thanks to him."}
{"text":"GO. HERE. NOW. I fancy myself a bit of a sushi aficionado, and I am SO glad we tried Sushi Roku at Caesar's.  They have some REALLY rare cuts of fish that I want in my life everyday.  We ordered Nigiri (Sake, Tuna, Hamachi, and Trout). The trout was the recommendation of the server and GOOD GOD, best nigiri I've ever had. Imagine Salmon, which is so fresh and buttery and smooth, but MORE buttery and smooth. It was like what salmon WANTS to be.  We also tried a few rolls which were incredible, but the nigiri is really where they shined.  I can't wait to come back next time in LV! ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I went there for happy hour today at 5:58 and the hostesses say that it ended. How is that possible when it says that happy hour is until 7. It's a good thing I asked but that's a little sketchy when their website and yelp says that happy hour is 4-7 Sunday thru Thursday."}
{"text":"I spent my 21st birthday with my family in Las Vegas and this is where we chose to eat on our first night. Due to a freak snow storm, the restaurant as well as the city was mostly empty. It is a beautiful restaurant, providing an escape from the mall it is in. The best Japanese cuisine I have ever had and the price isn't ridiculous as many restaurants in the area. I highly suggest trying the sake sampler. Being more of a wine snob, I never considered sake with a meal mostly because I knew nothing about it, but each glass came with an explanation. The service was right on point as well. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"5 stars for me. Went for my birthday and was impressed with the service and quality of the food. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's sad when chain places lose that sense of service. No one was rude, but by no means was anyone welcoming.
The spicy scallop roll I ordered was on the fishy side (usually an indicator of bad seafood) and I told them I didn't care for it. So awesome - I still had to pay for it! (Please hear the sarcasm.)
Hummus was great, presentation of everything was beautiful, but I think they should work a bit on customer service. 
Try smiling while you're at work, not telling me your back hurts and you can't wait to get off.

Also, quick tip - don't order the red wine that's on happy hour. Thinner than a Pinot noir, but supposedly it's a Cabernet Sauvignon. Tasted like wine tinted water."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a taste of the rich life without actually being rich, then consider hitting Sushi Roku at The W hotel between 5pm and 6:30pm Monday through Saturday.

This place is great for a date or a place to kick it with friends. You are at The W, so you have the upscale feeling of being posh, and because the prices are so good during happy hour, you can actually have the satisfaction of saying \"I'll have one of everything on the menu\" which is exactly what I did!

Atmosphere: Sushi Roku is a quintessential modern Asian establishment. While it is chic, it is oddly authentically Asian. It feels open yet intimate at the same time.

My favorites from the menu:

Sushi Roku Fusion ($4 a glass, $18 a pitcher). As you walk past the bar you will notice a gigantic glass jug filled with fruit and vodka. This is the Fusion, and it is deliciously addicting, yet sneakily strong.

My favorite sake, nigori sake (cold, unfiltered sake which in in my opinion has a lot more flavor and is smoother) and also hot sake for just $4.

Miso Eggplant ($5). I have never EVER desired eggplant or ordered it at a restaurant, but after trying this dish, at least once a week I find myself salivating over the thought of the Miso Eggplant. This appetizer is a big reason I keep coming back.

Sautéed Chinese Green Beans ($3). Crunchy and flavorful, these beans are the beans knees! I don't fancy myself a vegetarian, but I have never been so delighted eating a plate of straight veggies.

Tuna Tartar ($6). If you like raw tuna and avocado, this dish will melt your taste buds. Don't let the ugly name fool you. This is a beautiful dish with a beautiful taste.

Oysters ($2.5 each). These oysters have more flavor that most any other oyster I've swallowed. They have a garnish of Asian citrus flavors which subtly mask the true oceanic taste of the oyster, so if you are looking for the traditional unadulterated oysters, these may not be the ones for you.

On a side note, kudos to the staff. The servers, bartenders, and managers, are extremely accommodating, helpful, and very friendly. They all genuinely wanted us to have a great experience, which we did.

After your meal, take the time to meander upstairs and see the outside dining area which edges the famous W pool, the social epicenter of the who's who's and hooha's of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and amazing view of strip. The my really value their customers and want to please them. Definitely consider going here if you are wanting sushi in vegas. The desserts are great too."}
{"text":"We both ordered the Chef's choice, wow, it was delicious & included some hot surprises!! Great view of the strip!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in on Saturday evening around 830 and sat in the front of the resturant by the bar. The food was so so, however  our waiter was amazing(wish I would have gotten his name). He was so kind and compassionate and very knowledgeable of the menu.  Las  Vegas restaurants need to take notes on this type of service; as we will be back to try the menu again and hopefully get the same gentleman who service us last night!!!!!!

We came in Saturday evening December 26th  around 845."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and great food. They truly went above and beyond.. the yellowtail appetizer is amazing, we ordered two.."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the food here! We had a party of 5 and ordered a number of dishes for the table to share. Whether it was a fusion dish or traditional sushi, every single dish was VERY VERY good. I'm not a big fan of truffle oil but I definitely thoroughly appreciated the Yellowtail/Foie Gras/Truffle Oil creation. The kobe was super marbleized. The sampler was a lot of fun. I could go on and on about each dish. As an afterthought, the decor is beautiful and the service is great too. =P

The only thing i didn't like was the hostess. The place was clearly not full but she made it sound like it was the end of the world that we didn't have a reservation and would have to wait. Arrogant much?"}
{"text":"I rarely give one star; however, this dining experience was one of four bad ones. Having given this a chance over and over, I'm throwing Sushi Roku under the bus.

Three of the four times I've dined here, the drinks came after the food.  The front staff are friendly but some of the staff was down-right rude. I've worked in the service industry for years and cannot believe the attitudes of the servers.

One of the servers lied to us and told us they were out of pitchers because she didn't want to sell $15.00 pitchers.  The manager actually admitted that she lied and there were plenty of pitchers.  She also lied on our tab and took advantage of a large table who would have tipped more than 30% had she been honest and courteous.

The food I would rate, okay.  I find that they don't use the best ingredients and inexpensive soy sauces, etc.  

I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone.  If you want bad service in a convenient W Hotel location, go for it, but Roka Akor far surpasses Sushi Roku."}
{"text":"We had miso soup, crab dynamite roll and the sushi mix with spicy tuna roll.  The spicy tuna roll tasted very fresh.  Miso soup was also excellent!  In comparison, the food prices seemed very reasonable."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the sushi we received was subpar.  The crispy tempura and the crispy shallots were cold and soggy.  The rice was not fresh and the short ribs were extremely tough and rubbery.  This had such high reviews but the food did not live up to expectations.  
On the up side our server was amazing and did everything she could to make our night enjoyable. 
If you are coming here for food, I would urge you to rethink."}
{"text":"Good music great service. Been a fan and a frequent customer of the Hollywood Roku. The sashimi was marginal but other specialties were as expected. Also the drinks were better than the Hotel bar!"}
{"text":"Alright I am not lying when I say Sushi Roku has the and I will say it again the best filet mignon I have ever tasted!!!!....!!!!! (medium rare). I could take it apart with my fork and sight pressure from my knife.   We had popcorn shrimp too (big portion). I was so full when I left.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is dark  but sexy and has a great view of the strip (so ask for a window seat).  My girlfriend had the spicy tuna roll which was good. 

 The app menu is long so don't get confused like I did, but I was impressed with  popcorn shrimp, so no telling how large the other apps unless I hear it from you yelpers. But there was some stuff that sounded good."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. We tried almost everything on the menu and it was delicious. Great atmosphere and it's not super loud so we can talk comfortably. 

Highly recommended! Drinks were great too."}
{"text":"I have nothing negative to say about Sushi Roku. I had the seaweed salad and lobster tempura. The salad was very generous as was the lobster. The service was superb! My husband got the tasting menu and it did not disappoint. A lot of variety and they happy switched out the scallops to which he's allergic to. I can't recommend Sushi Roku highly enough."}
{"text":"People should seriously stop whining about prices in good restaurants.
The sushi here isn't \"mediocre\" as others claim. it's GOOD, quality sushi.
it melts in your mouth and your taste buds will thank you for every bite.
We were hungry, we wanted a good restaurant and that's what we got.
lots of food + sake + tax n tip cost us 80 bucks a person, but I can confidently say it was worth every penny, especially considering the gorgeous interior and the view of the strip while you're indulging.
Keep up the good work Roku!"}
{"text":"Great sushi place, probably the best in Scottsdale.


Great ambiance and design, good service and great manager.

The W is pretty much always on point with its restaurant partners. 

Try the diced Chilies and hamachi. Amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing view and service by Juliana and a lovely girl Janet who dropped off every plate with excellent descriptions."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Vegas!  Bartender was great and steered us to the best items on the menu.  Don't miss the miso eggplant or the rib eye wrapped asparagus - both are amazing and the portions are a decent size.  You can definitely make a great meal out of the happy hour utms and try many different dishes - they have over 30 on the list!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a party of 25 people and it was an absolute disaster! Customer service was horrible and would they would not split the bill. Horrible experience for a friend's birthday party. We will not be back."}
{"text":"yes yes yes!  amazing happy hour sushi.  the bartenders are friendly, the expensive far east mule cocktail was to die for, and the sushi rolls were phenomenal.  

Rock Shrimp Tempura Jalapeno and spicy tuna rolls were amazing, as were other I tried.  small seating area for happy hour, but force yourself in because it's well worth it.  

I was able to get the free wifi from the close coffee place while eating."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more than I did. 

Let's start with the good... Our waiter was excellent, truly top notch. He was attentive without going overboard. The restaurant is lovely. Nice layout, comfortable tables. We were shown to a table immediately without a wait. The restaurant was relatively quiet, which I appreciate.

Now for the not as good... We ordered the tower of fish. They had two versions on the menu. Their standard one for $99 and the premium one for $172. We initially ordered the standard one thinking that ought to be enough to feed three of us (2 adults, 1 child).  We figured this would give us some variety. Our waiter suggested that the premium one would be more satisfactory since it was all we were ordering.They had several special fish on the menu that sounded delicious so we agreed. However, it turned out there was nothing special about the selection we received. 6 oysters, 6 crab legs, 4 pieces each of albacore, tuna, salmon, and yellowtail sashimi, 1 scallop and 6 shrimp. The tuna was so-so.  The rest was well prepared but there was nothing special or exotic about it. We also ordered the sake sampler which again stuck with fairly standard sakes. Nothing particularly interesting that you wouldn't have had if you enjoy sakes.

For the price, I was let down by the dullness of their selections. That issue aside what they did serve was fine though not spectacular."}
{"text":"This place has a beautiful view of the strip! I have been here before a couple of times. I started with some Okunomat Sake for $35 for me and my husband to share. That was my first time trying it and I loved it. I then ordered the \"Avocado Hanabi\" for $15. It is a cube of greasy fried white rice topped with Avocado, it needed some kind of sauce and crunchy topping. I also tried the \"Katana Roll\" for $23. Again it was good, but just wasn't amazing. Overall, 5 stars for view, 4 stars for service, 3 stars for food."}
{"text":"We were staying at the W and decided to grab dinner here one night. Very friendly wait staff.

Ordered truffle edamame, crunch spicy tuna roll, makato roll, and popcorn shrimp tempura.

Truffle edamame - loved it, great flavor
The sushi rolls were good, nothing amazing.
Shrimp tempura was also ok.

Overall food was ok/ good- nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"We had the wild mushroom carpaccio which was exquisitly delicate.  Just the right amount of sweet and vinegar.  The sushi was quite fresh and the decor was wonderful with a nice view of the strip.  Service was also excellent.  Plus the people watching in the mall was an added bonus."}
{"text":"Much better than some other outlets in this chain. The trick here is to order appetizers, such as the tuna sashimi with crispy garlic chips, or yellowtail and spicy tuna on crispy rice, not conventional sushi and rolls, which are just so-so."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for overpriced, subpar sushi then this is probably the place for you. But if you want decently priced, good quality sushi - I recommend you take your money elsewhere. The boyfriend and I made reservations during our recent trip to Vegas to celebrate his birthday and we felt like we ordered a good amount of food - but the portions are pretty small, more like tapas and not main courses. We got the baked lobster roll, the tuna jalepeno roll, the eel avocado roll as well as free range chicken dish. The sushi wasn't quite as \"fresh\" as we expected and the chicken was... dry. The check came up to a little over $100 and we although we are pretty small eaters we had to go and get a round of burgers at shake shack later that night so we didn't have to go to sleep hungry."}
{"text":"Love sitting at the sushi bar, the chef's are always super friendly and really fun to watch. The urchin with the quail egg is a MUST for all you sushi lovers."}
{"text":"First time here. Delicious sushi and chefs sashimi. Excellent service. Specialty cocktails are great and don't forget dessert!! Donuts are best finish!!  Pricey but great views and great food! What do you expect on the Strip?!?!"}
{"text":"Sushi roku was one of the best restaurant choices we made while in Vegas. Although it was hard to find in the hotel/casino, the Ambiance and view were worth the walk. I had the tuna appetizer and popcorn shrimp along with a few rolls. Everything was awesome. One of our friends didn't like raw fish and still enjoyed the other menu items. From the sake to the salad, I would rave about this place. Next time I'm in Vegas, I will be sure to come back!!!!!"}
{"text":"We showed up out of the blue on Valentine's night looking for food. We got a seat at the sushi bar right away, but the place was otherwise packed. I guess we were lucky. We passed on the V-day prix-fixe menu and decided to order as we ate.

Our waitress was visibly perturbed by my wife's order of tap water to drink and vegetable tempura to start. Judging by her expression, she took us for deadbeats; it wasn't offensive but hilarious, we're old enough to be confident in our own opinions of ourselves. Anyway, the vibe at the W was definitely people trying hard to be cool and of-the-moment.

In any event, we struck up a conversation with the chef behind the bar where we were sitting. We initially ordered some basic sashimi dishes, but when I asked the chef for suggestions, he started rattling off a series of custom creations he could make. So we let him do his best, and he turned out a great collection of sashimi dishes, none, at least as far as I could tell, on the menu. 

We had a great meal, and we would definitely return, at least if we didn't live in San Diego.

(The waitress eventually warmed up, probably thawing as she watched us eat through plate after plate of sashimi....)"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal here on our recent trip to Las Vegas.  We tried some items from the menu as well as some specials - all were delicious - flavorful, fresh & creative.  Excellent service too."}
{"text":"Really excellent sushi. We tried a variety of rolls, sashimi, as well as the baked cod. Everything was great, although we ordered a few too many of the \"eccentric\" rolls that are either partially or entirely fried, or have a combination of multiple types of fish. I prefer the simpler items, and we had plenty of those, and they were just incredibly. The baked cod is also a great item to mix in with cold sushi.

For sake, we had cold unfiltered sake and it was delicious. A great alternative to the steak and shellfish restaurants in this area!"}
{"text":"I've hit the Happy Hour here each of the three past years. Consistently good (great?) HH menu and great prices. My favorites were the hand rolled jalapeno shrimp & the sashimi. Best dessert value in town just might be their $3 chocolate lava cake with ice cream. Save room for 1 or 2 of their house specialty drinks. The Crush & Ginger Lychee Mojito were both great."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku is a cute chic restaurant inside the W, but I was unimpressed with the semi slow service and small variety of sushi variety on the menu.  All in all, I think it's a good place to hang out in groups because of the decor and the drink selection."}
{"text":"We came in few weeks ago for an early dinner.  It was pretty empty since Vegas wakes up later on.  We were seated right away.  

Our waitress Debra M was polite and helpful.  Actually,  everyone was very welcoming.

We ordered...
Brussels sprouts 
Spicy miso soup 
Yellowtail diced
Hamachi Belly
Jalapeno Toro cut
Seabass with Truffle oil

Everything was fresh and tasty.  Portions were very small.  This coming from a person who prefers small portions.  So if I am saying small portions,  it's something.  Was it the best ever food?  No.  But it was pretty good.   

Since it's Vegas and there are so many other options, I doubt that I'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best sushi restaurants that I've experienced in Las Vegas. Great location, amazing sushi, and great prices."}
{"text":"Do you LOVE great food, a fun atmosphere for any kind of celebration, and spending about $60 per person for a cocktails and bites? If so, Sushi Roku is the place for you.

I made a reservation at SR via opentable.com, and our group of 7 were promptly seated. They have a fun offering of cocktails, and a decent wine list too.

Our table indulged in several sushi rolls, edamame, and other mains. Go for the panko crusted salmon (2 of us split the entrée, and it was plenty), and pass up the beef skewers (they tasted *off*, and were ultimately sent back and taken off the bill). 

After dinner, we were escorted by the restaurant manager to the velvet roped hotel lounge area where there was *LIVE* music. 

SO FUN."}
{"text":"Trendy place with great service and atmosphere. But like any tapas place, it is \"starving in style\" :-)

Will definitely visit again ... And even though I am not a tapas aficionado, I do appreciate the attention to detail in presentation and taste. This place meets or beats anything I have experienced in DC."}
{"text":"This review is tough, because I had a pretty good experience the first time and I really don't like giving poor reviews but I felt I had to share.  I've spent my time working in the restaurant world and I try to be very easy/understanding because I know it can be stressful. 

First experience a couple months ago was great, I'd give it 4 stars. Atmosphere is upbeat and fun, food is creative, it was good but high priced for what you get.  I went back because I had a good time, my second visit was terrible.  Our server Michelle was very rude (we're very easy/kind/not demanding), she snapped at us, messed up the order multiple times, and wouldn't even divide a check between two couples.  Every time we asked for something she'd snap right away \"NO\" and acted as if we were an inconvenience.  It was really disappointing because I brought friends and bragged about the place to come celebrate a special occasion, and it turned out terrible. I rarely leave a poor review but my overall opinion is good is decent, little too high priced, but worst service I've had in the last 2 years ."}
{"text":"Our group came for Happy Hour on a Friday. We ordered right before HH ended at 6pm, the waitress was super friendly and patient as a few of us who arrived late ran in just in time to place our orders.  

The table had the hummus with pita bread ($6) to share after hearing good reviews on it.  I found this dish was just OK though I'm not normally a fan of hummus anyways. We ran out of Pita bread and had to order more as we still had plenty of hummus left. I personally had a Hot Sake ($3), the Brussel Sprouts ($5), the RibEye wrapped Asparagus ($7), and the A2 Fusion sushi roll ($6).  The veggie dishes all tasted great! The crispy pork that came with the brussel sprouts added nice contrast in texture and taste to complement the already well flavored brussel sprouts. The asparagus dish was also done well - loved the soy-mirin sauce - and easy to cut through and eat (meaning the rib-eye was done just right and wasn't too overcooked or tough). The A2 Fusion sushi roll was disappointing though, I don't even remember how it tastes now... 

The prices are great for being in Caesars Palace, the quality was there, and the food had great flavors for the most part. Service was also excellent; we were checked on frequently but not intrusively, and all with friendly smiles. Would definitely come here again to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku is inside Caesar's Palace on the third floor of the Forum Shops. The inside is a mix of modern and Asian design. It looks sleek and posh. 

The food is a little pricey, but it is understandable since it's on the Strip. The view from the dining area is really nice. I ordered the spicy tuna roll because I am a huge fan of spicy tuna. It did not disappoint. The tuna was very fresh and it was obviously much better quality than other sushi places. 

This is a good place to go for dinner before a night out. Nice and classy."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and beautiful people in a beautiful hotel.  It's rather dark and loud, but I'm assuming that's the entire trendy feel they're going for.  Cocktails were good, I had the Pear Martini but I tried the Lychee which was even better.

We were a group of 10 for a bachelorette party, so we opted to share a ton of appetizers and sushi rolls:  

Edamame:  extremely oversalted
Yellowtail Sashimi:  9 extremely thin slices, delicious
Mixed Vegetable Tempura:  anything fried is good
Shishito Japanese Peppers: Awesome, except some of the peppers were unexpectedly too spicy
Crunchy Spicy Tuna: one of my favorites
Caterpillar:  My favorite (I love eel)
Baked Lobster:  Too much mayo (I'm not a big mayo fan)

We had some girls that were vegetarian, and there was a ton of selection for them, as well.  Great restaurant option if you're staying in the hotel."}
{"text":"We had a lovely sushi dinner tonight at Sushi Roku! I enjoyed the delicious calamari and ramen. We are celebrating a bachelorette party and they brought out a complimentary dessert with a sparkler. So unexpected and so nice! Great view of the whole strip."}
{"text":"Our service was terrible. We waited at least 30 minutes for our waiter, and then another hour and a half for our meals, and this was when the restaurant was NEAR EMPTY. The food was average for being overpriced and the overall experience was basically moot.

Our server Romi, specifically, was not communicative and responsive to our needs until after we complained. They tried to reconcile with dessert but it didn't outweigh the poor service.

In short, you're better off buying fast food. At least then it's affordable and the service is timely."}
{"text":"This place is great, service & atmosphere are amazing. Makoto roll is amazing and the scallop cut roll is great. Waitress was great with recommendations.  Will be back for sure on our next Vegas trip"}
{"text":"I made reservations for 7 at Sushi Roku for a bachelorette party dinner and everything went perfectly. We were seated right away upon arrival and received great service throughout. Our server was so attentive and knowledgeable and really made us all feel like he cared about our table. Everyone ordered alcoholic beverages, which were strong and tasty, and miso soup to start. We then ordered individual meals and the server happily split up our tab accordingly.

I ordered the Katana Roll: Spicy Tuna and Shrimp Tempura topped with Tuna and Yellowtail for $23 and it was delicious. It was spicy, but the roll was large (8 pieces) and plenty to fill me up. The Signature Rolls all came with 6-8 pieces depending on their contents and the other Rolls came with 4-6 depending on their content. 

I would highly recommend Sushi Roku for a romantic dinner, night out with friends, etc. it has everything you need. The ambiance was slightly dark, but worked perfectly with the Las Vegas Strip right outside the window lighting everything up. Best meal we had during our stay."}
{"text":"MY FIRST REVIEW IN OVER A MONTH, sorry I've been away for so long Yelp!! Now onto the review.

Cute place BUT looks can be deceiving, as we all know. 

AWESOME VIEW
Located on the second floor inside Caesars Palace, Sushi Roku looked promising because of the attractive decor and beautiful seating, the place practically looked like a lounge. Oh and I forgot to mention that the view is pretty awesome. 

Our reservations were made for 10pm on a Thursday night, which I kind of thought was weird because they close at 10 BUT hey whatever. 

KEEP ON ROLLING WITH THE DISAPPOINTMENTS
We ordered at least 10 rolls, might have even been 12. But each roll that came out was just as disappointing as the next!!! I'm not use to eating crappy sushi, can't expect too much from a Japanese restaurant on The Strip. The last roll that came out had my friends wanting to spit it out, they described the taste as rosemary soap (WE SENT THE DISH BACK BECAUSE IT WAS THAT BAD). Needless to say I did NOT try it because knowing me and my gag reflexes, I would have thrown up on the person sitting across from me after eating that. 

One star for the laid back ambiance and awesome view."}
{"text":"Less than Average sushi, wannabe Vegas vibe, trashy clientele. Highly disappointing. Upon ordering our server told us we couldn't order one of the items we wanted because it was no good. Another item was not acceptable to her either because it was the \"cheap version\" of a souped up roll on the menu (that was double the price). Our server was extremely pushy, rude and inattentive. We ordered 4 sushi rolls and water (7 dollars a BOTTLE!) and our total came to $100. We are local and never coming back!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here and the Chilean sea bass was amazing. So was the filet mignon and the poke. The only thing I didn't like was the lobster sushi roll. Everything else was amazing right down to the asparagus."}
{"text":"So it's my birthday night and made reservations ahead. I showed up and didn't have enough chairs and tables for my party. After asking for manager and complaining they added an extra table with chairs. After that they kept telling us they had reservations after which was total bull because nobody was after other than new people. So yes after a while they pretty much kicked us out the table and threw out some drinks that friends didn't drink because they went to the bathroom and still got charged. And to top it off I was not impressed with the food. So although they tried to accommodate me and my party they still sucked. Only good thing was that the place was pretty."}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic ambiance!  What a pleasure it is to see the General Manager walking around greeting every table and ensuring the guests were happy.  He made great suggestions to our dishes and even made us laugh.  I haven't seen this type of service from the top down in decades from an establishment especially in Vegas! Definitely a place to visit!!!"}
{"text":"Tonight we made the mistake of not making reservations, for their 50% off sushi night. I will own up to that. But myself and two others showed up at 4:55 not thinking this would be a problem. Three cold hostesses informed us that they don't open until 5:30, and that they are fully booked. Having worked in the restaurant industry myself I completely understood the fact that they were fully booked on this night, again, my bad. They told us the bar top (5 seats) was open though, and to return at 5:30 when they open. We went to the bar at the W to order a drink. At 5:25 we walked over to the hostess stand. The first thing they said to us was that we couldn't take our drinks in. Fine, understood. But the tone again was not appreciated. Then we look and the 5 seats at the bar are FULL. I'm sorry, at 4:55 you told us we couldn't be seated until 5:30. And at 5:25 those seats are taken? I'm giving roku 2 stars because I know their sushi is good. Which is why we wanted to dine there. And again, I get that we should have made a reservation. But the ice queens at the front door coupled with the early seating when we were told we couldn't sit down, made us feel like we weren't worthy of sushi roku scottsdale."}
{"text":"Do not come here with a large group. I give three stars only because our wait person was working really hard.

However, she was our ONLY wait person. She waited, she ran out food, she ran our drinks and she bussed our table. Not cool when you're rolling 20 deep.

The food was ok. Many items, like the chicken dish, were under cooked. I know it's a sushi place but chicken is chicken and is usually cooked, even in Japan.

The rolls were good but very slow to come out.

Basically they treated a large group of high rolling business people as a group of 20 somethings.

I don't recommend this place. Just go somewhere else especially with a large group.

FYI, we made reservations a week in advance so they knew we were coming."}
{"text":"Abolsutely wonderful! Great central location and view from Ceasar's Palace! I had sushi while my daughter had the ramen bowl. Now, we have been to Japan before and this ramen bowl was better than the ramen that we had in Japan itself. The food also came out varily quickly which surprised both my daughter and I. Wonderful place and I would very much recommend if you want sushi on the strip."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with great views of the strip. Great service and atmosphere. I had their filet mignon, which was pretty decent for a sushi/Jap restaurant. Their sushi was good too. I think this restaurant is more for the atmosphere than for the food. Don't get me wrong though. It's not like their food is subpar or anything. It is decent."}
{"text":"Not much of a hang out in Scottsdale person, but we happened to stumble on a Groupon for this place one day.  (And it was an awesome Groupon)  The place had a very nice atmosphere and decor, and we went a little earlier so it wasn't super busy.  I always feel bad for the servers that get those groupons because I know some assholes dont tip very well when bills are discounted, but our server Zach, was upbeat and very helpful in helping us pick out menu items.  The quality of the fish was excellent.  The spicy tuna on the rice cake thing was soooooooo good.  This place is definitely pricey, but if you can afford it, its definitely worth it."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! You must come to Sushi Roku while in vegas. The food is perfection, the GM is first class all the way, and service is spot on. This restaurant is in The Forum Shops at cesars. It has great views of the strip. I was there this Friday and everything was beyond amazing. Great for late night dinning. Thanks Sushi Roku Vegas team."}
{"text":"Went for a romantic date nite and it was amazing!! If you are going to splurge on a night out for sushi- this is the place I would recommend. The sushi is the best I've had in Arizona, and the service was terrific and efficient. The waitress gave recommendations, and made sure to accommodate to my allergy.. (Being Celiac makes me a bit worried to eat out but the waitress and manager reassured everything was not cross contaminated.)
I recommend the Taro and basically all the sashimi and rolls."}
{"text":"Went to Sushi Roku to celebrate my girlfriends birthday. Met Johnny the GM and Chef Alan. We had an amazing and wonderful dinner here. Everything we tried was really delicious. Really love the Spicy Tuna on Fried Sticky Rice and the Japonais Ribeye Steak. All of my girls had a blast here."}
{"text":"Living down the street we stop by for happy hour a few times a year.  The spicy tuna and salmon rolls both cut and hand are superb.  Other appetizers such as pork belly, Kobe beef, hummus, and fried chicken are also good.  It is not a cheap happy hour but good food is not cheap.  The Japanese beer is a great change of pace."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Sushi Roku chain and this is my first venture to the Vegas one... we were staying at Caesars and wanted a close place for dinner our first night there.

Great decor and amazing view of the strip from our table by the window.  Considering it was a Tues night, the place was packed but service was top notch.

Prices are in line with the other Sushi Roku's, which means pricey.  I live in one of the cities with the best sushi, so in terms of quality, Sushi Roku is a not the best or freshest I've had, but it's damn good considering it's in the middle of the Vegas desert!

We had a nice mix of tempura, beef, popcorn rock shrimp, and sushi - we had toro, salmon, unagi and spanish mackerel which are my go-to's.  Everything was a solid 4* and a nice variety of good fishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Liked it!  It's in the W hotel and my first trial of this chain.  The decor is great and I loved the large tables.

Sushi quality was very good.  I still prefer Nobu, but this chain is very comparable.  I had the usual mix of what I like: edamame beans, unagi sushi, a sashimi mix, rolls and their rock shrimp.  I first fell in love with rock shrimp at Nobu, and I think Sushi Roku does a very good version of it!  Tasty and good sized potions.  The fish has a nice flavor and texture.  The rolls were good quality - we had a spicy salmon roll (not on the menu but they allowed the subsitution), tuna toro with jalapeno, and a dynamite.

This place is pricey but I was happy with the meal and service and would return."}
{"text":"Love this place and if you get great seating, you have the view to the whole strip. The food here is great! I've asked for certain rolls that I have eaten at their SoCal location, and they were happy to make for me. Servers are attentive and the sushi chefs are all entertaining and friendly. Quality is always above and beyond, no complaints!"}
{"text":"Ok, ok, I'll give you 5 stars Sushi Roku.  I'm not a sushi fan at all but I was invited to attend a private birthday dinner here with one of my closest friends, how could I say no?

All aspects of the evening were planned in advance and I'm quite impressed with the level of professionalism each memeber of the staff here at Sushi Roku possessed. On point from start to finish!

I experienced some new eats on this night including sashimi (sp?)!  Much to my surprise the sashimi (tuna and yellowtale) was one of my favorite items tasted this evening. Still not a fan of actual sushi rolls, we're still making progress people.

Should the taste buds have a calling for sushi (or sashimi), Sush Roku would be at the top of the list."}
{"text":"We only came for the happy hour, and overall, it's a good deal.  For 6 bucks, you can get simple, yet decent rolls.  Beers were also  nicely priced.  For it being the strip, it was pretty affordable."}
{"text":"OK so where do I start first off the place looks cool and has a really truly awesome assortment of food on the menu. Plenty to choose from including carpoccios which are my fav. 

I ordered the 

tuna carpaccio = the fish was sliced too thick and had what tasted like a salty bottle bought ponzu. Dont order this if you want carpaccio 

Yellowtail carpaccio = delicious sliced thin and had the oils and herbs perfect. A good size too. 

Miso soup = the same as everywhere else 

The Katana roll = dude this thing is freaking amazing but for 16 bucks I dont know soo good though. 

some beef wrapped in asparagus= soo bad I took it back 

Spicy Tuna was over minced like mush 

All in all the meal was good but for 70 bucks I left hungry and pissed 

The waiter was soo weird and creepy. I was there with my gf and a friend and he asked my friend if she was having a rough night, WTF!!! Dont ask a girl if she was having a rough night. Might as well said you look like shit. So weird. 
Oh and the fact he only talked to my gf when he was addressing any of us. Talking to him was like pulling teeth soo damn weird. 


I did go back a second time and had good food and a waitress with a name with like all syllables. I wish I could remember it because she really is the best"}
{"text":"Walked the entire strip to have dinner here. Showed up during happy hour. The food was excellent and came out quickly. The spicy tuna on crispy rice, calamari and crispy shrimp are all to die for. We also got a few rolls including California, Crispy Shrimp w/ Jalapeño and Spicy Tuna on top of Crispy Shrimp. We enjoyed them all. Annie, our bartender/server, was very easy going, sweet and friendly. All in all, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I experienced fantastic service, delicious sushi, and great omakase from Mike.  He was very knowledgeable on sake wine and liquor.  Every time I'm in Phoenix this is my go to spot. They take great care of me when I stay at the W. Also check out their happy hour!"}
{"text":"I experienced the BEST service I have ever received at Sushi Roku this past weekend, if I could rate this place 10 stars I would. We had a large group in for a friend's birthday, and had to wait about 15 minutes for our table due to a conflict. Although we were hardly bothered by the wait, the manager came by to apologize for the inconvenience, and even sent us a few free appetizers. He stopped by several times to see how we were doing, and our waitress made sure to make the night as special as she could for our group. I highly recommend this restaurant for a nice and affordable night out--the staff is so friendly and the food is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"We went there to dine after the Rock n roll marathon. The place was highly rated on Yelp and we were very excited to try it out. The sushi/fish was fresh and delicious. However, the miso soup was salty and they forgot to add in seaweed. Our waitress service was subpar especially for this upscale restaurant. She didn't refill any of our drinks. She didn't check back on us to see if we needed anything else until it was time for dessert. She came to the table in front of us more than 5 times during our visit but no more than 2 times to our table. Also,  the 2 hostesses at the front were not welcoming compared to other restaurants in Vegas. This was a total disappointment.  Sad to say but we will not be coming back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Good.....not great. The food was tasty but I don't recommend doing a \"trust me\" menu with the waiter alone.....our waiter told us he would prepare one we could share and it was very lackluster (i'm taking about beyond basic...spice tuna roll, tuna sushi, pot-stickers) so that was disappointing. Nice ambiance, but for the prices, I would go somewhere more upscale and that takes more risks, like Nobu. Also it was a birthday and I told 4 people but they still forgot to bring my husband the desert and sparkler to the table.....I ended up having to remind them and they served it to him in the bar on the way out...pretty lame but better than nothing. Don't do a special dinner here is what I would recommend."}
{"text":"I can always expect good quality sashimi at sushi roku.
and the black cod is really good too!"}
{"text":"Never been here before, but they were having a \"half-off\" promotion to celebrate their birthday.  Basically half off your entire bill.  Great deal.  However if I was to judge this place based on their normal prices, I'm not sure I would've considered this place worth the money.

The place is set on the bottom floor of W Hotel in Scottsdale and it meshes very well with the reputation and the vibe of the hotel.  Hip, sheik, trendy, while at times bordering on over the top.  The hostesses are screaming at the sushi bar everytime they walk their guests to their tables (sounded like they were yelling fishaaaay or something).  Got really annoying after awhile.  But I digress.

For the appetizer we got the crispy rice asparagus.  Basically an asparagus skewer covered in a fried batter of rice and peanuts.  The saltiness took me by surprise.  Not bad, but not what I anticipated.  For the main dish, we got the twelve piece assortment to share.  In reality it was more of a 20 piece dish as they served a mixture of california rolls, crab tempura, and a mix of different sashimis.  Basically reads like a greatest hits menu.  The albacore and octopus weren't really my thing, but the crab, tuna, and salmon were all pretty good.  It was more than enough sushi for two.  We washed it down with some saki of course.  For dessert we had a chocolate lava cake.  They got this one right, as the chocolate was moist on the outside and liquid hot on in the inside.

All totaled, one appetizer plus the sushi assortment, saki for two, dessert for two, with the 50% discount and tip was $55.  Great deal with the discount.  Normal prices are somewhat in line with some of the popular sushi venues I've been to (though you pay a little more for the venue I'd imagine).  Personally I like going to the small local mom and pop Japanese establishments like Hana, Tokyo Lobby, and Cherryblossom.  The prices are right, the quality is just as good (if not better), and its feels like a more authentic experience.  But thats just me.  If you're not picky about atmosphere or price and just want a sushi fix, this trendy Scottsdale spot will suffice."}
{"text":"I love sushi and Japanese food, I tried this place for delivery because I was craving ramen but I was disappointed. Their $15 pork ramen came with 2 tiny slices of pork, the spinach salad was 1/2 a cup for $7 it was salty n tasted like strong vinegar... couldn't eat it. The California roll was good but standard and you get 6 pieces for $10+. This place is overpriced."}
{"text":"Best sushi we have had to date. Staff was attentive, and very knowledgable. Very impressed with every aspect of Roku!"}
{"text":"I really like the ambience of this place.  It has a great view of the strip, great location in Caesars palace beside the fountains & statues.  I like the sushi selection and the way they presented the food made it more appealing.  Besides aesthetics,  the food was great.  I've been to plenty of sushi places & this is one of my favorites.  The desserts were great as well!  I forget exactly what it was I had but someone posted a picture of it (it was a decadent chocolate cake with ice-cream). . . it was delicious.  Must try this place."}
{"text":"I cant believe people think this is good sushi. The 8 piece chef special was sour and soggy. Very over priced and terrible. Save your money. I was ripped off."}
{"text":"This is no 4 star sushi restaurant!  Anyone that reviews this place 3 stars or more is used to eating sushi in Alabama gas station. I do not remember the last time I had worse sushi. The fish was flavorless and chewy and the tuna smelled. This is by far the worst sushi experience I've ever had and what's worse is I spent 60 bucks for 3 ITEMS and I'm leaving the restaurant still hungry."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Sushi Roku. It was a nice setting and the decor is very pleasant. The service was just okay, nothing special. The food was good. We had a premium priced edamame beans that were pretty much the same as I have had everywhere including the frozen food section of my local store. The Ikura, Uni were both good, but again not over the top. The soft-shelled crab was very nice. We also had a couple of rolls that again were good, but not memorable. All in all it was a good dinner. Had a chance to catch-up with friends. The noise level was good so having a conversation was easy."}
{"text":"Met my brother here for a quick bite... The food was good, but not AMAZING. Prices are high since it is located inside the Caesars Palace Forum Shops- but the service was great."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chilean sea bass I've ever had. Listed as an appetizer, can be a meal with a sushi roll on the side. Great sake and wine selection. Amazing sashimi as well. Excellent service. Great ambiance , perfect for a date or business dinner. Some seats have a view of the strip. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Place is really nice and servers are really. Ordered some sushi and sashimi and fired rice. Rolls don't tastes good, sashimi and sushi are really good for this price. I would expect much tasty than other sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch as it was the closest Sushi place nearby. I'm definitely glad we checked it out, the food and service was excellent. 

We had the Specialty Roll: Shima Roll and the flavors were superb.
I recommend the Banana Flambe for the dessert!

Will definitely come back again on our next trip!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner and the food was super good!! We met Johnny, one of the partners of the restaurant as he was going around the tables. This is a really nice touch! Quality service and we enjoyed talking to him. Our server was quite busy with another table, but we understood and he ended up making up for it. What a nice guy!  

Must Try:

Baked Lobster Roll
Beef wrapped Asparagus 
Beef skewers (Waygu?)"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi - expensive for sure. Small pieces of nigiri..our waitress was really nice, service I thought was excellent. The daily special tako roll was excellent. Soft shell crab plate was like ..really..really small. And it was over $20. A+ for service. B for size portions. A for taste. I'd recommend you trying it."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch. Everything was delicious. Love the U-shaped booth seating. Super comfy..Our waiter was very friendly and put up with us changing our order a bunch of times. We randomly mentioned us celebrating our friend's birthday and to our surprise our waiter brought out a yummy banana flambe with a champagne glass filled with white sugar and a giant sparkler. 

Although we enjoyed our meal, service, etc. there are so many great sushi places in town to try, so it might be awhile before we come back."}
{"text":"Review is for takeout only:
-called at 615 on a Sunday to place a takeout order and was put on hold for 10 minutes before the hostess took my order
-was told my food would be ready in 35-40 minutes
-I arrived at the restaurant 45 minutes later and waited another 20 minutes for my food (which was just edamame, brussel sprout chips and two sushi rolls)
-stupidly did not check the food handed to me as I was in such a hurry to leave, but they gave me a shrimp instead of eel roll
-will never order takeout here again"}
{"text":"New favorite!  The spicy tuna and jalapeño roll. Spicy and amazing!  

The Katana roll was also delicious. It had shrimp tempura with tuna and yellowtail on top."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time. Overall, good experience, but would recommend stick with raw fish as that was certainly the highlight.

-salmon sashimi - delicious
-toro sushi - heavenly and worth the market price
-eel avocado hand roll - like any sushi joint so skip it if you are looking for special items
-baked crab hand roll - its much better at katsuya  so this is a definite pass
-hanabi - how can you mess up spicy tuna on crispy rice- order it

Look forward to trying more sashimi on my next visit..."}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace. The atmosphere is very open, with a modern Japanese vibe. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share. Among them, the roasted cauliflower, miso eggplant, tofu 3 ways, and a vegetable roll that they let us choose the ingredients for. The only item we didn't like was the slabs of cold tofu. I love tofu, but we couldn't even eat this. Everything else was great!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas has tons of high-end sushi restaurants battling it out to be known as the best (Nobu, anyone?). We try a new one each time we are in town (eventually we will be able to name our favorite... maybe). This trip we tried Sushi Roku in the Forum Shops.
We are sushi lovers, but for some reason other dishes called out to us more at this restaurant.  We decided to try a few of the premium (read high quality ingredients and therefore expensive) appetizers.

We started with Kobe beef tataki - a method involving a brief sear, slicing thinly, and marinating in vinegar or, in this case, garlic and ponzu. This was one of my husband's favorite dishes from the whole trip - he was very tempted to order a second round.
Next we had a salmon carpaccio with truffle soy vinaigrette which was very tasty.
Lastly we had panko crusted salmon with wasabi and tonkatsu sauces. This was one of my favorite dishes of the whole trip. The salmon was warm and flaky and moist on the inside with a crispy crust of panko on the outside. The wasabi cream and the tangy, savory tonkatsu sauce (typically served with breaded, fried pork) worked perfectly together. I could eat this every day and I would be very happy.
We both love unfiltered sake, and Roku had a very good one that we had not seen anywhere else before.

2 out of three dishes being overall trip favorites gives this place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The only thing better than the food is the service !

Easy location, Attentive waitstaff, plentiful menu. The only struggle is deciding what to order."}
{"text":"Food was so amazing. What made the meal special was our waitress Danielle. She knew the menu inside and out and made wonderful recommendations. My only complaint are the prices. Average $22/roll but the fish was very fresh. Ask for the White Lotus roll - it's not on the menu."}
{"text":"The restaurant is kind of tucked away from the stores inside Caesar's but it's a hidden gem. The inside is presented very nicely. They have happy hour between 4-7pm and has a decent number of options for a good price considering the price of the original menu. They have a whole variety of liquor at their bar. It's perfect for a late lunch between touring all around Vegas. The sushi was really good and fresh. They aren't that much though but I did not complain because the side dishes/apps were pretty filling m."}
{"text":"Call me ... not impressed?

Okay, I get it, this is again supposed to be one of these hip, nobu type of places that you don't really get sushi, or American food, you just kind of pay for the atmosphere. Well there isn't really much of that here so I'm not entirely sure what you're paying for.

It's definitely another to be seen place, but it's not even very good at that. It's in the forum shops for one ... and they just can't seem to decide what kind of restaurant they truly are. 

The sushi rice is terrible, and the sashimi is hit or miss. Their hot food takes eons, literally ... and the drinks are overpriced. Basically, skip."}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty good for happy hour! I don't like it nearly as much as ZEN32 but the waiters were cute and its a little fancier than some other local sushi joints. A good choice if your tired of other sushi places in the valley."}
{"text":"Great place...excellent sushi, and they encouraged pounding on the table for our Saki Bombs! love it."}
{"text":"Great ambience, exceptional service and over the top food.  I have been to this location many times and it has been consistently top notch.  Usually get the \"Omakase\" (chefs choice).  I have tasted many different offerings and everything is fresh and tasty.  Not a sushi person...they do have beef as well and I wouldn't pass that up either.  I am told all their chefs are master sushi chefs from Japan...and it shows.  If you're looking for a $10-15 meal...this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Very nice! The atmosphere is a bit mall restaurant and there were kids galore, but the fish was super fresh. We tried several inventive dishes, including blue fin tuna with truffles."}
{"text":"the restaurant is trendy and has a great view. even though the place was not too crowded, the noise level is a bit intense - so on a busy night, it would probably be really noisy. 

we came for the sushi and overall, it was okay. it was fresh enough, but not the best i've had. we had the 'special' which was foie gras wrapped in hamachi and topped with black truffles. that was yummy - and you paid for it! ($50 for 3 pieces). dessert was actually very good - we had the tempura green tea and it was pretty awesome.

service was a bit uneven. you really expect great service for the price you pay, but they were just 'okay'. for a part of two - we ordered several sushi rolls; sake; and dessert and spent about $150.

overall, a good experience but wouldn't frequent this place."}
{"text":"We were a little scared from the front since it was a Thursday night and it seemed empty, but after walking to the back of the restaurant, we realized everyone wanted to sit by the view over looking the strip-ROMANTIC.

Honestly, I could live off the spicy tuna here. It's perfectly spicy, perfectly textured, and perfectly great. Try the spicy scallop hand roll and yellowtail sushi too; all their fish is extremely high quality, and it obviously reflects the steep prices.

We ordered a bottle of Saki (can't remember the name, probably because I couldn't  pronounce it at the time), and it went down extremely smooth and had a great, light flavor.. Our waitress would run over everytime she saw our shot glasses empty and pour us another round; ROYAL TREATMENT."}
{"text":"I come here a lot to eat with friends.  The sushi is always amazing but...  The service is terrible.  It will be dead and the service is still terrible.  Takes 30 mins to have someone come to your table after being seated.  Then 30 mins to get water.  30 mins to bring your drink.  Dishes left all over the table.  They bring a dish all the old dishes I have to hold them while they place them and give them to someone.  I'm always dressed up.  I risk getting my outfit dirty being their buss boy.  We started to order 2 drinks at a time when we go now.  To be paying $800 and more every time we come to get sushi service should be amazing.  This has been going on for years here.  Hire a top of the line restaurant manager and servers and more help.  Such a great location and food service is ruining your restaurant.  Get it together and fast."}
{"text":"Since I live in Florida I'm a little spoiled with good sushi quality. I didn't feel this restaurant had great sushi and it was extremely overpriced."}
{"text":"One of the most fun nights I've ever had was spent at Sushi Roku.  Ambiance excellent, service excellent, food excellent, experience excellent!  The 50 minute wait even with 7:00pm reservations -1 star.  

We were a group of 8.  Cold and hot/ filtered and unfiltered sakes came out very fast.  On to the apps.  Everything ranging from edamae to homemade tofu to traditional house salad with ginger dressing was ordered and everything was delicious.  For dinner everyone was there for sushi except for one couple.   The meat eater chose the Japanese Kobe Wagyu dish which almost made me wish I got that instead of sushi and his wife chose the Chilean Sea Bass dish..... beautiful presentation on both.  

As for the sushi goers:  Blue Fin Tuna, I've never had it before, fresh and amazing!  All of the basics... Toro, Yellowtail, Salmon, Snapper, Halibut, Eel, etc.  (Don't hate my review because I'm using the American names... I don't want to screw up the spelling......) and then the rolls.....Spicy Tuna, Spicy California, Rainbow Roll, Caterpillar Roll.....mmmmmm.mmmmmm Good!

This was an excellent dinner......the server was really upbeat and even did a sake bomb with us!  Next time I'm in Sin City I'm definitely coming back to Roku."}
{"text":"There are a few times in life when a meal is so expertly crafted and planned that it is nothing short of genius. Tonight I had one of these! Dan is a great manager and makes the experience so much more fun!"}
{"text":"We went with our kids and it was good.  The kids thought their rolls (California roll and tuna roll) were just ok.   We loved the roll we had and the sushi sampler.   The location is good, the view is great and the wait staff was very good.   

The prices are definitely on the high end but overall it was a good night out."}
{"text":"For two people, we ordered a glass of wine, an iced tea, one appetizer and two sushi rolls.  The bill came up to over $80.  And after putting in a tip, roughly $100 for lunch for two.

The food here is good, but it's not great for the price that you pay.  I probably wouldn't eat here again, unless I got a solid discount or maybe happy hour (if the prices are a lot cheaper for the food and drinks).  I'm pretty sure that there are other sushi restaurants in Vegas that could provide a similar tasting meal for much less than what you pay here."}
{"text":"Lots of great sushi places in Vegas and this is one of them! We tried the special A2 roll, baked lobster roll, and tuna jalapeño roll. All were excellent and super fresh fish! We had a nice table with a view of the strip. Service was alright but could have been better since we never got water."}
{"text":"Consistent, fresh quality fish.. I like that they don't drown their sushi in sauces .. Very clean and all about the fish ... On the downside it's extremely pricey.. dinner was $150 for me and my hubby."}
{"text":"Best california roll I've ever had made with fresh alaskan king crab and not the imitation crab roll.  I also got some yellowfin sushi that was delicious. Service was excellent and I really enjoyed sitting at the sushi bar.  The chefs cut up fresh whole fish right there."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and liked both times I was here.  It's located in Caesar's towards the back so might be somewhat hard to find. 

We ordered the omakase menu, which came with multiple courses along with some sushi.  It was savory and had no regrets for springing for the extra dough on the chef's choice.  Yes, it's pricey for the dinner entrees.  American Kobe and Japanese Kobe steak not the same - Kobe beef much better!  The sushi / sashimi prices are on par on what you would find in Japan - so the sushi prices weren't pricey in my opinion just the end bill.  

We liked the cool, retro interior albeit somewhat dark but it had a good view of the strip.  We had good service both times eating here.  I usually only get omakase (chef's choice) at a sushi restaurant but I would come back."}
{"text":"Very good sushi and excellent service.  A bit on the pricey side, but to be expected as it is collocated with the W hotel."}
{"text":"Food not bad.  Wine list decent. Service and presentation and follow through - horrid. Non-educated staff as well. Disappointing. Will continue to go to Tao or elsewhere for Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"We are back at our favorite japanese restaurant! Master chef Haru made special creations for us and its absolutely great! I highly recommend chef Haru if you want to try off the menu special sashimi creations! The seafood here is always top notch and service is always impeccable! The rib eye is also very tender and tasty. We will definitely be back next time we are here in vegas!"}
{"text":"Ok, I understand. It's Vegas and the primary object of the town is to separate me from my cash as quickly and painlessly as possible.  But to be charged 120.00 for 2nd rate sushi is a little much. Understand, it wasn't bad, the Uni was not #1 grade. The Saba had a strange spoiled note, but overall everything was ok. But the price was absurd, the quality overall was second string and I walked away feeling a little used. I was a volunteer and made the decision to eat here. If the bill had been 40-50, no problem. But it wasn't. Eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Just mention this place and my mouth starts watering with the memory of the fantastic toro they served on the night I visited.  Soooo good....

I sort of don't remember the rest of my meal b/c the toro was THAT good.  I believe I had a roku roll...yes, that was good too.  They have a nice cocktail list.  I'm pretty sure I had a saketini, and I'm pretty sure I liked it.  Oh, and we had edamame, which was also good.  Even the non-sushi eaters at our table enjoyed their food!  They serve a variety of cooked items, for your friends who don't dig raw fish.

Which is fine, because that means more toro for me!"}
{"text":"This place is a must if you're in Vegas, whether if you eat sushi or not!!! They have tons of options for non sushi/fish eaters. Service and atmosphere is just excellent and very welcoming! 
I do visit the one in LA, but let me tell you the service here was much much much better than my experience in LA. 

Highly recommended, this is my go to place when going to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Staff: Our server was nice, efficiently attentive.  No wow factor, but I'm not the type to go looking for one.  It did take a while for us to get our check, but I'm assuming it's because most people will loiter there after their meal.

The goods:  I had a steak teriyaki something or other.  It was good.  I guess I'm a little indifferent because people rave about this place, but I don't remember experiencing anything ethereal about it.  Still though, it wasn't bad.  I'm really picky and bias about my sushi, so again, not really wow'd.  As far as sushi goes, I could stand to eat it again.  My dessert was fantastic, but you can't go wrong with a molten chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream.  And my friend got the fruit mix with different dipping sauce.  Never heard of a kiwi dipping sauce, very unique.  It was sweet and delicate, very tasty. 

The atmosphere: This is where it got good.  I loved the decor.  I did manage to trip on the round stones, but that's more my fault than the restaurants.  I liked the dark tones and wood and modern yet aged feel.  It was very pretty.

I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't bad.  I wouldn't mind going back, we had a nice view and a nice meal, but I don't think I'd plan my next get-together there."}
{"text":"Really, 6 bucks for a cup of hot tea? Ell with avocado was pretty plain and tasteless. Server also forgot out green peas (never got them) very pricy. Not recommended."}
{"text":"OMG hands down BEST sushi EVER!!!! We go on average 2 times a month and OMG it is so so fantastic!!! We try other sushi restaurants and always come back to Roku! Does not get any better than this.....There is no better sushi in all of Vegas and Henderson! trust me we have tried MANY!!! 
MUST GET the baked crab roll :)"}
{"text":"Always come here when I'm on town for work. Outstanding food and service is consistently good. Half price apps and rolls at bar during happy hour can't be beat."}
{"text":"Best sushi of my life... FOR REALS.
Better than any place I've tried in SF...and there's no ocean nearby Nevada!! 

Everything I had was amazing. Def try any type of tuna. The toro was deliciously-incredibly-mouth-wateringly tender. It was like butter. Or yogurt, or something just a smidge stiffer then yogurt...umm... basically it was super soft.  mmmm!!

I don't want to go back to Vegas anytime soon...but when the time comes, I'll be looking forward to 2 things- Qua Spa & an amazing meal at Sushi Roku!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi spots in Vegas hands down!! And don't worry, if you don't like sushi, there are so many other options for you. 
I was very impressed with this place. My sister and I dined here for a girls night and they took such great care of us. We got a seat with a view, when it was packed. The manager comped our dessert, just cause. Literally, I would give them 10 stars if I could.
It seemed like the type of place to take care of their regulars, and locals. 
A couple of the dishes that stood out to me were the Jumbo Shrimp, and King Crab fried rice. 
The shrimp was served with potato style chips, and a creamy sauce. I am still wondering what was in that sauce. It had a savory, yet sweet honey butter flavor. So delicious. 
The crab fried rice just hit the spot. There were huge chunks of crab, and the dish was packed with flavor. No need to add soy or hot sauce to this one. 
There were a dozen or so sushi options, and a variety of small sharable plates, or full size entrees. 
Park valet at the Forum Shops to avoid the tourist traffic. From food, to service, and even price, I was highly impressed all around. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Expensive but worth it. The brussel sprouts appetizer is so delicious that I've tried to recreate it at home. The sushi was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"From the moment we were sat, we waited for almost 10 minutes to be greeted by our server.  The restaurant was empty by the way...we were the only poeple in there.  When we asked about the menu, we got the vaguest descriptions of the sushi rolls.  Being the only table In the restaurant, we were surprised that our order took extra long.  The server never came back and out drinks were not refilled.  Part of our order was finally delivered but our appetizer was not to be seen.  We were finally told that there was a problem in the kitchen and a few minutes later the appetizer and second roll arrived. You would think. Being the only table in the restaurant, everything would be perfect.  Not the case.  Maybe that is why they are so super slow for lunch?  We'll go back to RA next time. :("}
{"text":"This place is so great I don't know where to start. Here I go! The entrance from the parking structure to the restaurant reminds me of Beverly Hills CA. When you walk in you very welcomed with the staff. The art work and lighting is amazing. I sat in the bar had old fashions cocktails with new makers mark whisky I've never had before. Ordered different sushi that was delicious.

Ryan and Alex were very helpful in helping me choose the perfect drinks and food.

I strongly recommend this to anyone that pretty much wants to enjoy some good food and a high class experience.

:) enjoy"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch while I was in town and I was lucky to get the Executive Chef at the sushi bar. I started with the spicy miso which was excellent. Perfectly prepared miso with a touch of spiciness made it an innovative take on a staple.

I then had the toro carpaccio which was rich and unctuous. The toro was ultra-fresh and minimally topped so the flavor of the fish stood out.

For my entrée I went with the Matsu special which was 8 pieces of nigiri each with it's own special toppings and/or sauces. I particularly liked the toro and salmon offerings which were dressed with ingredients that completely enhanced the flavor of the sushi. 

Service was great and while it is indeed pricey you are having your meal prepared by a classically trained sushi chef who puts care into each preparation."}
{"text":"Fish is fresh and they use real wasabi. They toast their nori in sesame oil for their handrolls and it males a difference in texture, fragrance, and taste. Highly recommend of their happy hour from 4-7 for amazing deals on sushi and apps and $3 sake carafes."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant? Check.
Amazing service? Check.
Mouth-watering food? Check, check, check!

To end our mini vacation in Vegas, my family and I selected Sushi Roku as our last lunch spot before heading home and we couldn't have chosen any better. Located in Caeser's, Sushi Roku is on the second floor and offers a marvelous view of the strip for your dining pleasure. Inside, there are plenty of tables and since we were grabbing a later lunch, we didn't have to wait long to be seated.

One of my BIGGEST regrets was not getting our waitress's name because she was absolutely amazing. Not only did she surprise us by busting out in Vietnamese, impressing my entire family with her clarity, but she also came by frequently to check on us and gave great explanations of each dish as they arrived to our table. Her service alone deserves five stars.

Portion sizes at Sushi Roku aren't too large so for a party like ours, nine people in total, it definitely meant ordering multiples. We chose a variety of dishes such as: yellowtail diced chiles, fluke kumquat sashimi, baked cod \"saikyo-yaki,\" beef rib eye wrapped asparagus, spicy pork belly \"kakuni\" fried rice, the spider roll, and the Katana roll. 

The yellowtail sashimi was mighty spicy, but mighty delicious while the fluke sashimi had a more refreshing flavor profile, thanks to the sweet kumquat. The beef rib eye was cooked on an iron hot stone, creating a sizzle that would make anyone's mouth water in anticipation. The meat was tender and the asparagus had a good crunch as well. The baked cod, however, was melt-in-your-mouth buttery and literally fell apart with the slightest touch. The miso sauce was sweet, but never once overpowered that delectable fish.

One of my favorite dishes was the kakuni fried rice with pieces of fatty pork belly. It is definitely not a waistline-friendly dish, but your taste buds will thank you profusely. The Katana roll was dressed in a creamy, spicy mayo sauce that added a buttery flavor to the yellowtail and spicy tuna while the spider roll was a bit more simplistic. 

Because portions aren't too great, we all still had room for dessert so we ordered the yuzu creme brulee with green teen ice cream as well as the green tea tiramisu. My pick for the best dessert had to be the green tea tiramisu. It was an incredibly light and airy dessert that had you inhaling the whole piece without all the guilt. The matcha flavor was prominent and paired well the espresso layers. The yuzu creme brulee had a refreshing orange-like taste and the green tea ice cream was deliciously smooth.

With food of this quality, it's no surprise that breaking the bank is a must. But even though you won't feel stuffed silly, I'm certain you'll still remember every dish with fondness. 

Sushi Roku is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Not bad not bad at all. If you're looking for \"asian fusion\" cuisine: sushi with spicy sauce and fried stuff, teriyaki steak and expensive sake - you'll like this spot. Cool, dark, trendy decor overlooking the strip - perfect for a dinner date or group dinner. Feels like you stepped into a different world from the shopping mall exterior - well, cause you technically did.

Expect to spend $50 min for some food (enough to make you full but ready for late night pizza later) and A drink. My sushi combo - spicy tuna roll and about 7 basic nigiri was about $28, glass of Rombauer chard was $18. Yes, a little pricey on the wine, but oh well, it's Vegas.

A fair comparison to this place is Sushi Samba in the Venetian...Would I go back? Sure, if it were suggested. No, if I had my choice. Too many other places to check out in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We had a family dinner here prior to me and my fiance getting married. This place has totally ruined sushi for me anywhere else. It was absolutely amazing. We did a tasting type deal where they brought out many different dishes of sashimi, rolls and such, everything was fresh and nothing like I had ever had before. And I am one who did not eat much raw sushi before this trip. It is going to be very hard for me to eat sushi just from anywhere from now on and previously I was ok with eating Kroger sushi :) This will be a definite stop for me when I return to Vegas and a definate recommendation for those who are in the vicinity. I love this place!"}
{"text":"came her for lunch after a crazy huge dinner experience, sushi sounded perfect! this place did us just right. The fish was fresh, the service was cool, but then again...there weren't very many people there eating lunch=) Toro was and has always been delicious to me, but one thing you should get is their japanese snapper? not too sure what it's called, but it's a fish that's hard to find...sashimi wise....almost as good as toro!=) but worth every penny!=) and their spicy tuna mixed with something (a recommendation by our waiter) was really good too!!.. so do your homework before dining at vegas, so you won't regret not losing it on a crap table=)"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife on Sunday evening. Didn't need a reservation we were seated right away. We ordered 2 sushi rolls and the sliders. Portions were small but the food was deeeeelish!!! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Food was great
Terrible drink service, waited 30 mins for a drink.
Asked multiple servers where our drinks were and no one seemed to know. Wish we had chosen a different restaurant on our vacation"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! We were sent by the Doubletree - Very fast service and the waiter we had was very nice - sorry can't remember his name. We went all out and got edamame and a roll of some sort, several different sushi plates, fish, and shared desserts. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Nothing thrilled us. Either we are terribly unlucky, or we really didn't order anything right that night. Here are the issues I have with this place: 

1. The ambiance is dark and when I say dark, I mean I can't see my date's face let alone see anything on my table
2. The menu is short, not too much creativity here
3. I don't care if we have to pay a Vegas tourist premium, just give us quality food and a memorable experience - yet they failed at that here. Although the nigiri was of great quality, we really don't feel the overall value is here whatsoever

Here's what we settled with: 

Miso soup $6 - two tablespoons served lukewarm with a miniature bit of tofu and nonexistent seaweed. Yep, I am pretty much sipping on warm, salty water. Skip it. Flavor rating: 2/5

Makoto roll $22 (spicy yellowtail & shrimp tempura wrapped with seared tuna spicy creamy sauce) - Sloppily rolled with lots of rice, minimal fish, and no wow-worthy sauce or flavor attributes. The roll ingredients and sauce were all too dry and bland. I was missing any trace of spicy yellowtail or even seared tuna, that's for sure. Flavor rating: 2/5

Soft shell Crab roll $15 - The soft shell crab had excellent flavor,yet a tad too soggy for my preference. Again, why was the roll so shoddily put together? We did not dine on a busy evening (Tuesday night, close to closing), so there is no real excuse. Flavor rating: 3/5

Salmon Nigiri $8.50 - The salmon was sweet and fresh, yet, they were not generous with the cuts. What felt like a paper-thin, cheap cut was a tease in the end. Flavor rating: 3/5

Uni Nigiri $14 - The uni was vibrant and fresh, but again tiny portion, why would you ever need to pay $14 for uni nigiri, I will never know. It's not like you can't get it anywhere else as fresh, since you totally can for MUCH cheaper. Flavor rating: 3/5

We made the wrong step when we decided to be seated in the dining room floor with an awkward angle of the strip view. We might have ended up on a thrilling note if we dined along the sushi bar. For the same price point, I would have had more bang for my buck and a completely satisfied palate at Nobu. Eh, well you live and you learn."}
{"text":"The sushi here was so amazing and fresh, so very happy we popped in... after a long day of shopping this sashimi hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Let me just say straight off the bat; yes, the prices are expensive for what it is. But keep in mind, all restaurants and foods are usually overly priced on The Strip. 

Besides that, food was delicious! Boyfriend and I wanted to try the brussel sprouts chips but they were out for the day. -__- what!? awwwwww......man! So we got gyoza dumplings and the seabass sliders (one order came with two) as appetizers. The sliders were my boyfriend's favorite item of the night. The tartar-type sauce had a kick to it. The seabass was crispy. We would definitely order that again.

We decided to order three kinds of sushi. As a staple, we always get an order of spicy tuna roll at any sushi/Japanese restaurant we go to. This one here, ehhhhh....it was only alright. We could definitely do without. Average and I've had spicier, better ones at other places. 
We also order the Shima roll: shrimp on top of spicy tuna, cilantro and avocado. It looked like it was wrapped in soy paper. And we got the Baked Lobster roll in a creamy miso sauce. Both those rolls will definitely be a repeat.

Only reason why I gave it 4 stars (really a 4 1/2 star review) was because we really wanted to try the brussel sprout chips. If they had it available that night, this might have been a perfect 5 star rating. Plus I know the prices here might turn some people off. We got two drinks, two appetitzers, 3 sushi rolls and our total was a little over $100.00. Overall, I have no hesitation to come back here (if I want to splurge on sushi)."}
{"text":"The crunchy tuna was mushy so I decided to go with an even easier dish, chicken fried rice. It was over seasoned with so much pepper but some how some pieces got none of the seasoning and was burnt. They even over poured on my mixed liquor causing me to miss out on all the mango and spice that my Mango and Spice Was supposed to have. I gave this 2 stars because the service was top notch but the place was pretty empty. I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I Love Sushi Roku :)

Ok, now that I've said that.. the review. 

Came here after not being in Vegas for a couple years.. I'd just gotten tired with Vegas. We walk in and even after not having been here for 2yrs our waitress Jessica greeted us by our names! Impressive! We'd not made a rez, so she didn't get it via that method .. she just remembered. If I had that type of memory, well I'd be lucky. 

While we'd like to check out the new Sushi Samba, and we know there are \"trendier\" places for sushi in Vegas, the service here is really what makes us repeat customers. There was a time when we would be in Vegas twice a month and would come here every time. The dining room/restaurant is chic, the view is amazing, and the food is fantastic but without the service we would probably spend more time exploring other places. It is as plenty of people have pointed out  \"pricey\", but it's Vegas and I've never thought of Vegas as a place to go when on a tight budget. In my opinion the price is justified by all the pluses of Roku.

The Food:

We started off a comped tuna carpaccio our lovely waitress brought for us. It was very flavorful and light at the same time. It was a great light starter. We nibbled it up too fast to get a picture.. sorry :x 

Tuna sashimi with garlic chips and sesame soy. We order this every time we go to a Sushi Roku.. it's so good. I love the clean taste of the tuna complimented by the sesame soy and the little bites of garlic flavor, mixed with the crunchiness of the chips.. it's such a great bite to have all of those at once!

Kobe with king crab. I don't remember much of it, but I do remember liking it. I just think that I prefer my Kobe either raw or very rare and it was too cooked for me. Kobe is fine on it's own :) If you want to try something different tho and you like your Kobe on the cooked side, this dish may make you go \"mmm\"

Foie gras wrapped in yellowtail and sprinkled with edible gold. This is another thing we can't pass up. Every time we have it, I think we know it's great before we order it, but we don't fully remember just how decadent and divine it is until we actually eat it. It really is fabulous! I'm seeing less and less foie gras on menus. I know the Roku in Santa Monica dropped foie gras so I'm going to enjoy this while I can and when I can.

Kobe Yakiniku. This is the thin slices of kobe that you cook yourself, usually over a hot rock. We thought it would be a fun dish for my daughter. I had a piece and it was perfect, however the cooking method needs to go. Instead of a hot rock, they bring out a mini grill and the meat kept sticking to the grill. It wasn't easy to get it off with just two hands.. I had to hold the grill part down(because it wasn't attached) with my chopsticks, while my daughter peeled the meat off. And it smoked a lot! Like up to the ceiling. 

Shrimp Tempura. It's shrimp tempura, I don't eat it my daughter does. That's that.

Sushi. We had Salmon, Tuna, Toro done two ways.. seared and not seared. Everything tasted super clean and the texture was perfection. I love the toro here and I get the feeling the sushi chefs here would never put something on your plate that they wouldn't eat. Some places have given me some nasty stuff. Never the case here. Only complaint, they forgot two or our seared toro.. apparently they didn't believe us when we ordered what we did haha. 

The waitress brought us two comped desserts, which I myself was too full for. They were eaten and they were super cute and pretty so I imagine they were yummy as well :)

Cocktails. I love the drinks here! I have two things I usually stick with.. the lychee mojito and the lychee martini.. they are both delicious. Sometimes I get the Kyoto Rose, it's different and it's grown on me.. the rose flavor threw me off a bit the first time I tried it.

Sushi Roku is the mix of everything that makes me a fan of a restaurant.. great stetting, fantastic and attentive service and food that makes me and my mouth happy :) If you go ask for Jessica and tell her I said hi!"}
{"text":"If you are coming for the view you will be very happy, if you are coming for the sushi you will be mostly happy.  My husband and I snuck away for a dinner from our group and based on reviews ended up here.  We started with mixed vegetable tempura and kobe beef potstickers....wonderful choices for appetizers. 

The Katana roll was delish and we were very happy with our choice here.  After all that we decided to do one more roll...we shouldn't have.  The Crunchy Spicy Tuna disapointed. It was warm which we were warned about but it was just bad and not crunchy. Overall good experience but was hoping for amazing sushi which was not here."}
{"text":"Great food presentation, taste and sushi is fresh.  Thank you Las Vegas restaurant week  for the opportunity to try their food.  I'll come back"}
{"text":"The service is phenomenal. The food is impeccable. The atmosphere is modern and relaxing. The food is pricey, but completely worth it. The back of the restaurant has an amazing view of the Las Vegas Strip, overlooking most of its well known hotels. I had the Albacore sashimi dish, along with a Spicy Tuna roll. Both left me feeling satisfied. I will definitely be coming back here for sushi soon!"}
{"text":"Greatest sushi in Vegas I will always come back here , the service is amazing and I always get treated well"}
{"text":"As a 16yr local of Las Vegas, Sushi Roku is hands down my favorite Sushi Restaurant in Vegas!  Been here several times and this last time we were a party of 7 in to celebrate a friend's birthday and from start to finish the service was excellent & attentive. Great view of the strip from where our table was located. The food & drinks though are what keep me coming back. The menu changes so even for us regulars there's always something new to be tied. I had the edamame hummus (only because I love both edamame & hummus & was curious about it) & crispy rice asparagus appetizers.  Next was the Kurobuta Pork \"Kakuni\" (braised pork belly) & my main was the Filet Mignon with Ginger Teriyaki sauce.  The hummus was great though they should serve it with a few more wonton chips than they do as those ran out long before the hummus did.  They did however bring out a few more chips when asked.  The crispy rice asparagus was  prepared and served as you would expect, and while it was good, it wasn't as memorable as other dishes the table ordered. The Kakuni on the other hand was my favorite dish of the night (and that's also including all the dishes of my dining companions that I also tried). All you pork belly fans, this is one of the best preparations I've ever had of this fatty delectable treat. The Filet was served sliced alongside mashed potatoes & garlic green beans...the Filet was perfectly cooked and seasoned perfectly! A phenomenal dinner was had by all! 

Also if you like cocktails that are sweet, definitely get the cookies & cream & pineapple upside down cake cocktails...phenomenal!  Already looking forward to my next return visit to Sushi Roku!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and got the beef teriyaki lunch bento. The beef was very tender and good!"}
{"text":"\"Try everything you want on the menu. I mean it. Try everything, don't hesitate now.\" Those were the exact words that came out of my mouth as I was sitting at Sushi Roku in Ceasar's with a Roku virgin. I first found out about Sushi Roku in Los Angeles located on 3rd and Croft by the Beverly Center and I was hooked. It's no Nobu guys, it's no Matsuhisa, it blows them out of the water.

First I had kimchee (pickeled cabbage) stuffed cucmber salad. Perfectly crunchy, salty, sweet, spicy. I could pop those in my mouth all day like potato chips. You just can't have one. The tofu steak was next with grilled mushroom au jus. Just outta this world. Perfectly done tofu with three types of mushroom, light, complex, and not overly filling which was perfect because we were seated at a table for two and between her and me we had ordered for four, at least. 

The tastings started to come, and the sashimi, and the specialty rolls I requested not on the menu from the head chef at the sushi bar. Baby tako that melted in your mouth. Hamachi that glistened and we swear could have been still moving it was so fresh. The fish was like butter. Even the edamamde isn't oversaled, isn't overcooked. It's fresh, light and absolutely perfect. The tempura can be ordered separately or as a combo, which means that I can order six broccoli and sweet potato pieces, which is always what I eat last on my tempura plate because I think it's the best. 

My sake was excellent. Nigori, which is unfiltered, was exactly what I asked for, salty, sweet, and heavy. Like a creamy dream, my alcohol was a match made perfect by the suggestion of my extremely helpful and quick waitress. The service is fantastic. 

The decor is wonderful. If you're by the windows you can see the strip and all it's glory at night. But look around. Private raised booths that still create intimate feelings are against the back wall. My table was close to others around me, but we didn't care. We talked with the couple next to us about how fabulous their food was and weren't they looking forward to flying back out to Vegas from NYC just to eat here. Of course, their answer was an excited \"Yes!\". 

This Roku is much better than the Los Angeles one in my opinion and I've eaten frequently at both locations. This is some of the best sushi I have ever eaten on the west coast. I will always go back. My name is in the computer system permanently, I always get a great table, and my people there take care of me. 

Live the good life ya'll. Sushi Roku is a gem in a luxury \"mall\". Have a few beverages and order \"a la Danielle\". Seriously, take one of everything. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best sushi house I have been to in town. The noise level was quiet but not so quiet where we could hear the table across from us. Our waiter Tim was fantastic helping us choose several kinds of rolls and sashimi, Tim even brought the food out over the course of 30 minutes allowing us  to savor the different flavors and have them smoothly blend through out the meal. Aftwards we were treated to a lovely frozen lemon tart and finished with a warm hand towel."}
{"text":"Excellent and fresh sushi with imagination and great flavors.  Loved this place!  The baked lobster is a must."}
{"text":"Ok, when i heard this was the dinner venue for our guys night in LV, I was quite disappointed.  I guess anywhere you can get a reservation for 12 on 2 hours notice for friday is unlikely to be the hottest place in town.  Not only am I not a huge sushi fan (I know, kind of a dumb comment for a review of a sushi restaurant), but its in Caesar's Palace.  We were staying over at Wynn, so we had to get across town and make our way past all the people with oxygen tanks hanging out at Caesar's (yes, I think clientele at Caesar's tends to be old and stuffy).  Place had no ambience, but that could be attributable to the crowd (NCAA tourney weekend, so lots of sausagefest tables).  However, food was AWESOME (bold statement for a guy impartial to Sushi). We had 4-5 kinds of tuna, and all were fantastic.  I ordered the filet mignon as well, which was almost steak house quality (yes, i shared it).  And by doing big beers and sake rather than wine, tab only came to $100 per person, which is half what I would expect to pay for dinner in Vegas."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always on the top of my list. The ahi melted in my mouth, it was awesome. I also had the filet; tender with a smokey flavor...this is a \"must go\" for the perfect dining experience!"}
{"text":"Decent but nothing crazy that would make me go back there. I'd actually give this place 3.5 stars. Either way, i would not make an effort to go here again."}
{"text":"Located in Caesar's Forum, Sushi Roku's seating view of the Vegas strip is amazing. The decor was romantic and modern. We ordered the 4 course prix for two and the entire meal was about an hour, it was long but it was satisfying. The service was excellent, you almost have to sit still and any movement they will come to ask how you are doing. 

Next time I'm in Vegas, I will definitely come back for more Sushi Roku."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to hate this place. You have no idea. 

And this doesn't come from a place of hate in my heart. I don't hate \"Scottsdale.\" The concept. The place. Or the people.

Ani Di Franco says \"If I were you, you're exactly who I'd be...\"

So if I was both a city and an undeniable DB (which are equally possible coexisting phenomena considering my paunch and treatment of other humans at large), I could indeed be Scottsdale. I could represent everything about it. 

But instead, some rich ladies and gentlemen, developers and career hype-hawkers no doubt, decided to build a representation on Camelback Rd so I could go on just being me, Dally G. Scottlas, Atlas' retard cousin, I am not. No, I did not just use that word.  

But, as I said, I don't hate it. I do hate hype. I do hate, kind of with all my heart, the fucking dumb asses who stand in line for video game systems, 
Starwars movies, and iPhones. So the 2000+ people who showed up at the pool at the W this weekend are the unjustifiably more socially acceptable versions of the 3 week line-standing uberdorks. I know I'm making a lot of friends here.  

So when I arrived at Sushi Roku for a \"press junket,\" I was like, I already hate this place. Just because I'm a judgmental asshole. And I wasn't greeted by a TOTAL FUCKING TOOL. By that I mean, some fucking asshole in a horrible, horrible tie who later introduced himself as an assistant GM, would not fucking acknowledge my presence as I'm leaning on the podium. Dude, the people at the front are more important than the famous chefs and stingray skin place settings! Get a fucking clue douche-nozzle! ARG! It wasn't until the main attraction arrived and took the bull by the horns that we were able to break into his extraordinarily minuscule external sphere of recognition or comprehension. 

Ok, so I have no idea what a press junket is... But I'm calling it that because it makes me sound like a pimp. And I need more of that in my life. But it was a night for press people from around town to come and check it out and get everything comped and interact superficially because they all seem to hate/judge each other. Who can blame them, really. 

And it was fucking marvelous. I loved the place. As a vegetarian on a meaty night, they hooked my skanky ass up. I had a breath-taking eggplant dish. Some tofu variety platter that would probably be about $15 I imagine, which was good but I would have to know the price before I could recommend it. I had a mushroom tofu steak and a fairly delish dessert. It was all very good. The seaweed salad was good but loud. Yes, very loud in my head. Our waiter, while it seemed that he had never worked in the service industry before, was genuinely nice and totally helpful with my surely annoying veggieness. 

We got a pseudo sneak peek of the pool area during a party that was going on. I didn't quite understand why it was so hush hush when there was already a huge party going on but whatever. The place is fucking rad. Bring a date there. Expect him/her to put out. Not because he'll/she'll feel obligated but because everything is sexier there. It's just totally amazing. 

The people walking around the rest property were as snobby as you'd expect and yes, they are judging you. But everyone should check this place out once. 

I guess this is sort of a review of my experience at the W as well. You'll probably live. Check it out."}
{"text":"Come for happy hour! It's the perfect timing to eat before going to a show. 4-7pm. Good sushi and appy selection that's half price. Their HH is more about the food than drink. Limited selection of lower priced drinks and cocktails aren't part of the deal at all. Surprisingly good little deserts for $4. 

Their sushi is much better than your average place. Very fresh with tender rice makes it worth it whether you're paying half or full price. The menu is pretty traditional. No weird combo rolls here. Just great quality. The creativity on the menu is in the hot and cold appetizers. Yum.

One bummer thing is their cocktails. Don't bother. I tried 2 - a ginger lychee mojito where I couldn't taste the ginger and the lychee and mint were served as garnish and not in the drink. So this drink was a rum and lime where the lime was a tart mixer. I don't like like my cocktails deconstructed thanks. So I tried a different drink...Cant remember the name but it was supposed to be a spicy vodka lime cocktail. Again the drink came deconstructed with the chili skewered on top as a garnish so the drink itself wasn't spicy. The lime was so tart I asked for simple syrup to sweeten it up and make it drinkable. Insult to injury, both the drinks came in short glasses with one huge ice cube that took up almost the whole glass do you couldn't possibly mix in the 'deconstructed' drink components. Avoid the cocktails!  Stick with the food."}
{"text":"Good service.  Sushi chefs weren't very chatty.  The portions on the albacore very good. Also had a nice soft shell crab roll.  Loved that they had fresh wasabi.  The only black eye... was the crunchy spicy tuna roll was awful.

I would have given 4 stars of not for the last roll.  I'm pretty open minded when it comes to food but it really was awful in my opinion."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Location is nice, with view of the strip. A little too dark in there, but nice decor/ atmosphere.

Shared the Chilean Seabass, which was very good. Had the titan roll which was okay, but nothing spectacular or worth the $22 price. And then go the black cod, which was very good. Octopus roll was very good as well.

For the price, I've had better, but it is a solid place if you're looking for good sushi."}
{"text":"I am an experienced sushi eater and I have been to Sushi Roku many times.  I can honestly say this is a top 5 place for me.  The fish is usually extremely fresh (one time it was merely good), the rolls are creative, the atmosphere is terrific, and the service is good.  It's definitely pricey but you're on The Strip, it should be expected.  All in all my go-to sushi restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great sushi happy hour. Great service. I was so busy eating I didn't take enough pictures. The rolls on the happy hour menu are either hand rolls or 6 pieces. I ordered 2 rolls, sashimi and wine for $25.00. It was a great deal and it tasted amazing. My favorite dish was the sashimi. I ordered the Tuna Tataki w/Garlic Ponzu and I was in heaven. It was so fresh and just melted in my mouth. I loved it. I wish I had went back today just to get more lol. I also ordered the A2 Fusion, this role was good but it was a grayish color do ascetically it wasn't very pretty. But it wasn't bad. My second favorite roll was the Rock Shrimp Tempura w/Jalapeño...this was just delicious. Fresh, a little spicy and very filling. Writing this review, I think I know what I'm having for dinner...my mouth is watering!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Cool place in the W Hotel!  Great atmosphere and great happy hour prices!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is inside the shopping center attached to Caesars Palace. Great atmosphere, romantic if you are on a date, quiet, clean. Our meal is ok. We had the spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, California and the lobster rolls. 
The lobster roll was amazing. The best roll hands down that we chose. My second favorite was the spicy tuna followed by the California roll. 
The waitress didn't seem to have it together that evening. My sister ordered the soup which she said wasn't that good. It was my friends birthday and they graciously comped our bill for the cake (chocolate) that we ordered. It was really good."}
{"text":"Pretty good drinks, but FUCK the wait for the table and the extreme douche crowd. Yuck! Food is alright tho."}
{"text":"Lunch - seaweed salad, pork belly fried rice, sushi sampler lunch with miso soup, all fresh and delicious. Beautiful dining room with a view of the Strip; excellent and attentive service."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku - how I thought I liked you!

I first went to Sushi Roku a few months ago, with the darlings Alysha N and Joanie M. We were having a very enjoyable night and were quite starving by the time we wandered into Roku. So we had a very good time, but with that caliber of company the restaurant was the last thing I was paying attention to. Also, that meal was very early in my sushi-eating career. Since then, I've been looking to go back.

Enter: 20% discount for locals. That's all it took to get me through the door for my 2nd run at Sushi Roku. This time, accompanied by Ramze S, and Mr & Mrs Mark G - all accomplished sushi enthusiasts, with Mark being something of a gourmet. Let me give it to you breakdown-style.

FOOD: The food was pretty good. Plenty of pretty good. and not enough great, especially with the prices in mind. The sushi & sashimi was pretty good quality, but nothing outstanding about it - and that was the consensus from the table. Where they seemed to do better was with the prepared dishes, which on our table was mostly appetizers. 

SERVICE: Acceptable at best. Yes, it was early in the evening and the place was just getting rolling. But on the other hand, it was nearly empty, so why not go over the top, Mr. Waiter? They didn't really foul anything up, but it wasn't the quickest service ever, and not only was friendliness or charm out of the question, but so was knowledge! The question \"Can I get fresh wasabi?\" took a 5 minute trip to the back before a \"No, sorry.\" could be returned. (And, for what it's worth, this is the first sushi restaurant Mark's ever been to that didn't have fresh wasabi)

ENVIRONMENT: It's a pretty nice place, that's for sure. And not uncomfortable. But it definitely doesn't look so hot while there's still light pouring through the giant glass windows, so come post-nightfall. 

OVERALL: \"Meh\" is right. We had a good enough meal, and a good enough time, but that's not enough these days, especially not at the prices that Sushi Roku charges. Even considering the 20% off, there was nothing special enough about the place to make it worth a return trip. We didn't feel taken or anything like that, but it takes more than not feeling robbed to get 3+ stars. 

Take some decent quality sushi, add all the pitfalls of a chain restaurant, mark the price up 100% and put it in the hippest room you can find. BAM! Instant Sushi Roku. If you wanna spend big bucks on sushi, even on the strip, you can find better places to do it."}
{"text":"Roku is one of the best places in Vegas. The omakase was unbelievable. The uni was incredible! Everyone here is the nicest person imaginable. Just an all around wonderful place to have dinner. The view isn't bad either."}
{"text":"A few days ago I got an itch I could not scratch.  Not in the pubic way, but in the sushi way.  (That's right,  I had a sushi craving.)  

I had traveled to Vegas for some business.  And, I had had enough.  I became gravely ill.  I was homesick.  But, before I could ride that wave.  I had to make one quick pit stop at a sushi joint.  

It was difficult finding a sushi place from Bally's casino.  But, finally I found Sushi Roku!  It was delicious!  I ordered 3 items.  The entrees and appetizers were all divine!

The hostess asked where I wanted to sit.  I shyly smiled and scanned the room.  Just as I was about to sit at a table.  To the corner of my eye I seen him.  Thats when I decided to sit at the sushi bar.  By george, the sushi chef was so handsome.  And, to top it off he made Amazing sushi.

Not to mention this place has a great ambience.  Nice music!  And, cheerful employees.  Its definitely sexy!

A+, yay."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful and the food matched. Really High quality fish and they made our anniversary special! The kobe meatball was also fabulous as the one thing we tried beyond sushi. We would definitely go back. The bread pudding was a nice balance with sushi too!"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in Las Vegas or Henderson. Always fresh, great variety and special fresh fish flown in every day."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying that this location is inside the W Scottsdale, and I ordered it up to my room. That being said, I wouldn't think it'd be too hard to get a bowl of spicy miso soup and 1 sushi roll executed, but I'm not sure of the quality and/or freshness (you are after all, in Arizona). The sushi had a very fishy smell yet no real flavor, and the soup was lukewarm and also lacked flavor. Clearly not worth the surcharge let alone regular prices, but you live and you learn. I think this sushi is best served in their dark swanky restaurant where you aren't that concerned with what it tastes like. I made the mistake of turning the lights on..."}
{"text":"Cool decor. good sushi.. colorful bento boxes. i loved their mushed spicy tuna over rice.. apparently only they have that dish bc i havent been able to find it elsewhere. and when other places try to make it, it doesnt taste the same."}
{"text":"This was the BEST sushi I have ever had! The service and ambience was excellent! The food was to die for. The spicy tuna crispy rice (which is called something else here) and the white fish carpaccio special were insanely delicious. I am a sucker for spicy tuna and they have ample spicy tuna dishes to choose from. We tried many rolls and we figured out that basically anything you get is amazing!! Definitely book a reservation ahead of time and I recommend requesting a booth!"}
{"text":"Love this Sushi Roku Location for its top notch views!
Good sushi, much better than the Sushi Roku in Los Angeles as well as Pasadena, ca.
The service was great, the manager was very very nice to us.  I think he had his eye out for our birthday girl ;)
Over all great place if you are visiting or having a birthday celebration.
But definately does not top Nobu!"}
{"text":"My only complaint is they are pricey compared to other quality sushi restaurants ie sakana on Hayden and Indian school but the food was good service was good and the ambience is comfortable"}
{"text":"Pretty good! I've been looking forward to trying this place out for a while and was not disappointing. We had the Kimchee cucumbers as an appetizer, nothing special just Asian pickles, but still good. I had the tuna jalepeno, which was good but really hot! I thought it was interesting that they didn't provide wasabi with out sushi, but after one bite, I realized that I didn't need it. It's pretty expensive here but the food it good and the service is very good as well. Definitely would consider going again and trying more of their menu."}
{"text":"Roku is to sushi as \"The Golden Child\" is to Eddie Murphy movies -- far closer to the bottom than the top.
Roll selection was weak, and construction was worse. Having said that, their crab dynamite was delicious."}
{"text":"The sushi and appetizers (miso and garlic edamame) were really good!  We got in fast, service was excellent, and the ambiance was beautiful."}
{"text":"Food is good. Not bad for Las Vegas Resort Restaurant. You won't be disappointed. The music is not so good. The service was okay. The decor is okay. The food was the best"}
{"text":"There were six of us, and everybody was happy with their orders.  I had cold sake (excellent) but they did not have the monkfish liver sashimi that night which I was looking forward to.  The organic kale salad was very fresh and tasty.  I also had the filet foie and the lobster tempura which were exceptional.  My friends raved about the Chilean sea bass which one of them recommended since she goes to this restaurant often.  The chocolate dessert (so good I forgot the name) was delicious!!!  The service was attentive and knowledgeable.  And of course the view of the Strip from our table was unbeatable!"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious but their suggested gratuity is way off! You have people drinking here and senior citizens who may not pay attention and just put what you recommend. If you go here pay attention to your bill so you don't get robbed on gratuity! This is breaking the law and deceiving their customers."}
{"text":"My friends and I were so excited to try this place. However we were treated with so much disrespect that we left the restaurant.  This  place is basically racist. It sucks how people are judged based on color of skin or clothes they are wearing. Why treat people like dirt?"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, friendly service...unique bathrooms (with unisex sinks).

But that's about it.

Serving sizes were pathetic. (I spend $30 for THAT?) Other sushi joints give you double the portions for the same price, if not half the price you'd pay at Roku. Quality was right on par with most other sushi bars. I did feel like I was being hounded to 1) buy a drink, 2) buy edamame, or 3) order more sushi (which many people probably do, considering the portion sizes).

I'm unlikely to return to this venue, unless I begin to miss the decor and snotty valet people."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas this past weekend and we came here for dinner. It was a nice place and heard good things about it. Its Vegas, so its going to be expensive on the strip let alone its in the forum shops at Ceasers. Anyhow, the sushi grade was great and most of the rolls were really good. The Katana roll was amazing. I ordered a side of the sweet potato tempura and i got two slice for 6 bucks. Had i known that, i probably wouldn't had ordered it. Anyways, it was good, but i would rather had eaten somewhere else for that amount of money."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Their beef dishes, fish, sushi, everything. Best Sushi Roku out of their four locations. Great atmosphere for hanging out."}
{"text":"Nice, friendly staff. Of course, we had met them first during our bachelorette party festivities at Ghost Bar.  What's not to love about single gals? ;p That's how they reeled us in. (Yes, we're suckers) Who cares they were fun and nice guys and I am a single woman in Sin City.

Pretty yummy food not necessarily the best Japanese food but tasty. On the pricey side though. Enjoy the Tokyo Cooler. I'm not much a drinker but I'll drink this and it was on the house. It soooo pays to a bachelorette in Viva Lost Wages. 

Great view. And they know to treat repeat customers. 

So is Kenji, the cute HAPA manager, on the menu? haha"}
{"text":"Like many of the reviews I thought the sushi was very fresh and the spicy tuna was actually spicy which u very much enjoyed. I also ordered the ramen and it was on point in terms of the broth being rich and flavorful. This is my new go to spot for sushi in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, so impressed. Crystal was both gawgeous on the outside and in and had impeccable service. Such a pleasant environment, the folks at this place, Mike and Nicole thank you for being so lovely with us. Perfect example of what good food and service should be. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This one's in Ceasar's Palace and our table had a nice view of the Strip.  We were also lucky enough to be sandwiched in between 2 big rowdy bachelor parties!  Sake bombs!!

Loved the scallops!  And the salmon.  We're roll peeps so we ordered a grip of them.  All were great, can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Love this place. Everytime we come to Vegas, we get our Japanese fix here. Plus we always ask for Courtney, who is a magnificent server and super awesome!"}
{"text":"A company took me and my coworkers here for a meeting and both the food and service were exceptional! We were in the private back room and had several appetizers to start including tempora shrimp and veggies, kobe beef that we grilled ourselves, and edamame. Everything was stunningly displayed and tasted great! We even cooked our own kobe beef on little grills over hot coals, which was fun! The sushi was delicious (and i dont usually like sushi!!!) i would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant if you want to make a good impression on your group and have an amazing meal! Pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"This was probably some of the best sushi I have had in a while, but the prices are off the chart. Everything was easily 2X as pricey as any other place I have been. I know good fresh fish is not cheap, but there is a $42 sushi appetizer on the menu which seemed obscene. The service was exceptional and the sushi was great, but $145 for dinner of 2 is just too much money regardless of the quality or the service."}
{"text":"My fiance & I love this place.  They have a happy hour in the bar only, but a few good food choices & drink discounts.  We have eaten in the main restaurant a few times too and enjoyed everything we have had.  Try the Tokyo Cooler drink...very fruity & delicious."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this isn't one of the highest-rated sushi places in Vegas because as an Asian foodie who often overspends on sushi, I was utterly amazed by the quality of sushi and culinary creativity at Sushi Roku. We had the sushi sampler for $65 and when it came, I saw some unusual combinations and thought to myself, \"Oh no, this had better not be some kind of Americanized sushi like Californian rolls...\" Well, it wasn't. The truffle addition truly worked, bravo. We also like the bartender and the friendly atmosphere. The only thing that I didn't like was the noodles; after all, this place is where you go for sushi, not ramen."}
{"text":"Good sushi, a bit on the expensive side compared to all the other sushi near by. Service was attentive and helpful as my cocktail took a while to make it to the table."}
{"text":"What a great place for sushi!!! Love the ambiance and the sushi, perfect! Our server Debra was wonderful! We told her we were open to her suggestions, just asked that she keep in mind my sesame allergy...she was spot on with everything, such great recommendations, everything was delicious! We enjoyed the Yellowtail Sashimi with Diced Chililes, Edamame (great flavor whatever they do), Katana Roll, White Lotus Roll (a bit of a kick, so good) and for dessert Uni. Everything was so tasty I would have it all again right now!!! We also enjoyed a carafe of the Sawanoi cold sake which was perfect for us! We highly recommend this place & Debra! Next time we're in Vegas we'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Vegas period!! Jason our sushi chef was awesome and Rene was great to make sure we had everything we needed. Food was amazing! Fresh and unique with a fun vibe."}
{"text":"The place looks nice and the staff was really cool. The sushi chefs were actually Japanese. The food was just ok however. It was a steep for what I'm usually getting. The best thing about Roku is they use real grated wasabi."}
{"text":"Very nice place with great service. The steak was great, the only thing I would hope they fix is the sushi. It's a very romantic place and my gf enjoyed it for VDAY"}
{"text":"Two  years ago it was the popped collared short sleeve shirt.

A year ago it was the striped button up long sleeve shirt.

This year, it's the black t-shirt with some sort of skull or crossboney eagle shape that has taken over as the \"official douchebag uniform.\"

Come to Roku and you'll see some of these dudes but seriously, don't stay away because of it.  

Roku was de-friggin-licious.

Highly recommend you stick with whatever specials are available on the left side of the menu.  

While slightly expensive, it'll make for a memorable experience.  

Just watch out for the Jersey douchebags.

Fresh."}
{"text":"Loved it! Came here for lunch.  Ambiance was nice and the view of the strip was beautiful as well.  The sushi was very good, but the sashimi was what was memorable.  We had salmon and toro sashimi.  The toro sashimi was absolutely delectable.  It was like butter!  The california roll was very good considering we were in Vegas.  I loved the options for vegetable tempura (considering my sister is a vegetarian) and the fact that they don't use peanut oil to fry it (my sister is allergic to peanuts)...When they found out that it was my mom's birthday they brought out free dessert and a sparkler (an actual firework). That was nice. This was a very pleasant experience and if I am ever at Caesars again, I will come back."}
{"text":"The sushi here is very good, however, I don't feel like the high prices are worth it for the quality of food. One thing that upset me is that they secured the raw fish to the rice with wasabi!! I was disgusted as I hate the taste of wasabi and they didn't have that information on the menu. The appetizers were good, especially the seaweed salad. It was nothing to write home about here. I'd definitely try another sushi place before I come back here."}
{"text":"Always a stop for us. My son had the King Crab Fried Rice and LOVED IT. We had a couple of rolls and were very good.  Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here from day 1 to present.  The food has remained good, I feel like the specialty cocktails are missing their mark though.  Their selection of sushi is good, but there are a few favs. they are missing.  *can't remember their actual names* Some of the dishes are fabulous like the beef wrapped asparagus but, their tofu sampler (cold) was not good nor flavorful.  When I come with my foodie friend we just tell the sushi chef to prepare some great sushi (omakase style), they make a specialty roll for me & we order our fav hot dishes with some nigori sake.  It is always great this way... however, I don't see the bill and probably wouldn't want to."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Roku.  A friend and I decided to get lunch here one day because we didn't want to fall pit to the \"we're in Vegas, let's have buffet\" like we did the time before.  I had had Sushi Roku one time a couple years ago, but wanted to try it again.

We were promptly greeted and sat at the sushi bar.  The chef was great.  I threw out a couple suggestions of what I like, but wanted to have his recommendation as to what I should have.  Although they didn't have ankimo this time, he did recommend a few other dishes.  

The tako roll was really tasty, but the nigiri I had was by far better.  The katsuo was one of the best preparations I've had in a very long time, light sauce and onion, perfect!  Katsuo is my favorite fish, and actually one of the cheaper ones.  It wasn't even on the menu here, but he had it! =)  I next wanted to have a full aji (i.e. sashimi, nigiri, and then the filet is deep-fried), but the aji was already filleted, so I decided to just have a couple pieces seared.  The next was a great recommendation of saiko sake.  Saiko sake is what the Japanese consider to be the best salmon in the world; this salmon comes from New Zealand.  I normally don't care for fattier fish, but this was exquisite.

I admit the food here is a little pricey, so make sure to get the good stuff.  If you want California rolls go somewhere else.  If you want to be adventurous and have high-quality sushi, this is the spot."}
{"text":"Thank you!!! The restaurant promised a front row table to NYE fireworks and delivered.food and drinks were great. Fun times!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!  Everything in Vegas is pricey, and this is no exception.  However, when the food is amazing and the sushi chef is knowledgeable, it's worth it!  Prices weren't too bad...  I usually check the prices of the spicy tuna roll (since every sushi place has them) for comparison.  The Spicy Tuna Rolls at Sushi Roku were $11.  Again, expensive, but not over the top.  And for delicious sushi, I'll take it any day!  Make sure you go here - much better than Yellowtail Sushi in the Bellagio, and less expensive too!"}
{"text":"Sushi Roku is a very elegant and fancy sushi lounge and bar inside Caesars. It is somewhat difficult to find, it is up the escalators past the Forum (the shopping area) and is in one of the corners.

Inside you will see lots of empty space despite an okay number of other diners but the place is so big that there are bound to be many open tables. A nigiri (fish + rice underneath) averages 4-5$ a piece, with a blue fin special they had at the time of 13$ a piece. I expected this to be mind blowing but it was very very average. The salmon belly was super fatty as expected, it tasted super fresh but the texture at the end of the day was just not my thing, but not their fault as I just wanted to try it. The salmon nigiri was good, we ordered a lot of \"regular\" nigiri and those were all solid. The eel one could be a little less cooked but still decent. Overall I would probably not pay that much for this. A friend got some kind of roll for 20$ but it tasted very average as well, I could get the same for 12-15$ in NYC which is really saying something.

The view though is amazing, like a super awesome view of the strip. The lounge is cool as well, you have enough space away from other tables to do your own thing, and the couch chairs are super comfortable (which is also the case at the dining table). Food I would give 2.5 stars given the exorbitant price, but view and atmosphere I would give 4.5."}
{"text":"This was my first time with my friends.  The waiter was OK. He introduced himself and asked us if it was our first time so I said yes and that it was my friend from Chile, South America.  The waiter did not explain, offer or promote anything.  So we ordered some California rolls and other foods, there was 4 of us. The food was excellent,  we had sushi before from a scale of 1 to 10 I will give it an 8. Suddenly I saw this very nice looking lady carrying couples of plates so she stopped and came over with a radiant smile and explained the dishes and introduced her self. It was very pleasant and great she said her name is Sarah and came back to ask us if we need anything and I ask a few questions about the menu and drinks. Due to her awesome personality and warm smile we all felt like we were at home. Sarah mentioned her passion for foods and the interaction with people,  she loves to meet others and make them feel at home. I WILL BE BACK JUST BECAUSE SARAH MADE OUR NIGHT MORE MEMORABLE. The manager was an awesome person as well. Thank you Sarah for being a real person and make our night something to remember.  I will refer Sushi Roku to all my friends.

{"text":"From 4-6 PM every single day of the week, you can go and forget that bitch, Lady Luck, totally ditched you at the baggage carousel, that you lost this month's mortgage at the Craps table, and that the \"hot\" slot machine you sat with for so long was nothing but a tease. Because from 4-6 every day at Sushi Roku, you can pretend that you're a high roller, order a large Kirin beer, a spicy tuna roll, a shrimp tempura and jalapeno roll, an order of spicy prawns and chips, and a mini chocolate volcano cake off the Happy Hour menu. And when you get the bill that's less than $20, you can feel like you've just hit the progressive jackpot. Except that you are still leaving with an even lighter wallet. But at least you don't have to worry about paying that pesky winnings tax."}
{"text":"Had a blast! Made it a girls night two evenings ago. I made reservations through their website for 9pm on a Saturday night \"girls night out!\" It was VERY busy so I was glad I had made reservations. We were able to get seated on time, however we waited a while to get our food. There was only one person at the table who ordered Sushi so it is not fair for me to rate the Sushi even though she said it was good. The rest of the table ordered drinks and main entrees. I am not a big meat person more of a veggie lover, though I spilt a  Teriyaki Steak which included Mash Potatoes, Rice and Sautéed Veggies. Along with Tempura Vegetables. Everything was great! The quality and quantity was reasonable for an upbeat Scottsdale restaurant. Our waiter was energetic which made it more fun. 

Overall the restaurant was very clean. The staff was well groomed. The scene was hip, young and vibrant.  The bar is small but very packed. Great variety of food selections for those with different food preferences and large selection of beverages. The restaurant is attached to the W hotel so you can mix and mingle in the lounge or upstairs in the patio bar."}
{"text":"Overpriced average sushi, with a staff that made us feel like we were bothering them.  I don't get the hype.  If we spend over $200 for a party of 3 I would expect stellar food and a bit of ass kissing.  Had to remind them of items we didn't receive and the sushi chefs are as rude as they get.  They pretend to greet you nicely, but they are miserable and added to the fact the place was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials and attentive staff. We like sitting at the bar during happy hour because the bartenders, Joy and Ryan, are so wonderful. Gary, the manager, walks around and talks to customers to make sure they're taken care of. All in all, great service."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the beautiful interior, food, and service.

Coming from San Francisco, my bf and I were skeptical about Japanese food and Asian food in Arizona. However, we left feeling full and and content.

We ordered:
-Special trio of the day (it was delicious! I believe it was octopus, scallop, and tuna)
-Ramen: it was surprisingly good. The broth was so rich.
-Sashimi platter- spicy tuna rolls, California rolls, and assorted sashimi 

I had a ginger lychee mojito that hit the spot.

I'd definitely come back if I visit Arizona again."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite vegas spots to grab sushi.  It has actually become a tradition!
Everyone is always so nice and the service is great.  I always make a reservation as we are usually a party of at least 4+. We've never had to wait.

Moving onto the food. I stick to what I know and like. We get salmon sushi, albacore sushi, baked crab hand roll, spicy yellowtail handroll, ikura with raw quail egg (Kinda bland). Everything has always been fresh and delicious. The sake is great as well.

The shishito peppers were AMAZING!
One of my favorite things about this place is the torch bday candle. Can't wait to be back again."}
{"text":"I came here on Friday night, got a nice booth close to the sushi bar.  My favorite place because not only does it have a fun sexy atmosphere, but the food and service is great.
 We had: 

The Yellowtail with diced chilis in ponzu was ordered right away, that stuff is melt in your mouth flavor.

Popcorn Shrimp: Awesome!

Filet mignonette wrapped asparagus is super fun dish that comes out on a hot rock!

Salmon, Yellowtail, Tuna, Eel and Sea Urchin Sushi.
Quality fish. Don't like sea urchin anywhere else.

The star was Toro sashimi / Caviar on top. Really decadent.

Katana and Mokoto Rolls

 Baked Crab Hand Rolls! Always need these!

They have a good wine and sake menu, and one of the girls got a cold nigori, which is a milky sweet sake. The rest of us had some same bombs! 

The best part is I was afraid to go because it was a double date and my co workers date is allergic to all types of stuff, including nuts and shellfish, but I assured him the steak was good, which I get sometimes. He ordered the Ribeye Japonais and loved it! It comes with potatoes and green beans and has this buttery garlic sauce that is so good.

Our server Jennah killed it as usual. I always ask for her, she really knows how to take care of guests. Waters never empty, no mistakes, very professional.

The employees in general are really trained well to keep the table clean, since so many small plates are coming and going.

This double date was important to me to have a bonding experience with someone from work! Thanks Sushi Roku!"}
{"text":"While staying at the Indigo on business, I was referred to this place by my hotel bartender after I asked for a simple sushi place close by.

Simple it surely was; there were only a few people at the sushi bar and maybe two or three couples at the tables. Actually it was a bit boring, but then again, a quiet, no-frills experience was what I had asked for. Perhaps Wednesday is a slow night.

What I gleaned from my experience was:

1. High sushi quality, on par with what I have found elsewhere in Scottsdale.

2. Good service; I was asked very frequently how things tasted or if I wanted anything further. You might say this was due to the slow night, but I have certainly experienced poor service at restaurants under the same conditions.

3. Low prices, certainly relative to what you get in this neighborhood. I believe that for six nigiri pieces, a roll, and a small sake; the total including tax was $27. Not too shabby.

The high quality I had expected out of a Scottsdale joint; the high value I did not. The only reason this place did not receive 5 stars was that it had a bit of a strong smell. Not fishy, more reminiscent of fried food. Perhaps a tempura order went out of control; things happen. It was not unbearable... yet I could smell it on my clothes later that evening. Then again, I am sometimes overly sensitized to smells. Rest assured, will still go back to Sushi Roku next time."}
{"text":"My friends I recently went to Sushi Roku after discovering them on the Whistl app for iPhone. We got there at 6, just in time for their happy hour! We were blown away by the ambience of the restaurant, it was modern, but had a timeless sense of class.

We stuck strictly to the happy hour menu, which features 30+ small bites and drink, including sushi rolls. We started with Edamame Hummus w/ Wonton Chips ($3). It was  justt the right consistency, and very refreshing. The edamame and wonton chips were a nice addition that gave this mediterranean dish a fresh asian twist. We also had the America Kobe Meatballs ($4). They were deep fried, but not greasy at all. The dipping sauce was also an excellent paring with the meatballs. Next up was the Hanabi for $5 (Spicy yellowtail on crispy rice). This was by far our favorite. The crunchiness meeting the soft texture of the sushi was out of this world. It was one of the most unique dishes I've ever had at a sushi bar. We also got A Spicy Yellowtail roll and an Albacore Salsa Roll ($3 each). Both were excellent, exactly what'd you'd expect from a cut roll. To top it all off we got the Bana Berry Spring Rolls ($3). The crunchy exterior meeting the sweet, soft center was excellent. The drizzled caramel on top made it only more perfect. 

Overall we had a great experience with the food. We would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys asian cuisine. Also, if you love finding deals like we do, you should definitely check out the Whistl app on the App store. Free to download and no signup!

Enjoy Fellow Foodies!!"}
{"text":"I've been to many restaurants, and this server named David stands out amongst the best.  Thank You"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at Sushi Roku for the first time this evening. Ayden was our server and he was one-of-a-kind spectacular! He was extremely  informative, professional and thoughtful. Ayden answered my many questions about the impressive menu and suggested the perfect pairing of delicacy and drink. We were honored to have the manager, Kyle introduce himself and offer his warm welcome. 
We savored each selection that was offered us. I am fortunate to have dined at all of the top restaurants in Scottsdale and without a doubt Sushi Roku is amongst the best in quality, atmosphere, presentation and by far, service. We will most definitely return to dine at Sushi Roku again. I highly recommend Sushi Roku, and of course ask to sit in Ayden's section and may I suggest the avocado appetizer and the crab roll with butter sauce."}
{"text":"I ate here with my husband. The prices were standard for Vegas. The restaurant is in the mall and somewhat open to the shoppers. We had lunch without reservation at 2p and were seated without issue. The service was fast. I would recommend the tuna sashimi Carpaccio."}
{"text":"We had reservations for New Year's Eve on our first visit to Las Vegas.  There was a $160/each omakase but we decided to order a la carte since it was way more food than we would want.

The first warning sign should have been that the restaurant is located in a mall, and the second that it is on the strip in Las Vegas.  The food was just ok but the prices astronomical.  For what we paid for the entire meal we could eat twice at the best sushi restaurant in Atlanta (which blows this place away).

Most annoying was the \"Tofu 3 Ways\"... It was 6 slabs of raw tofu taken directly from the package with 3 \"ingredients\" sprinkled on top.  I think one was caviar, one maybe scallions and I don't recall the third (it was that forgettable).  Really a 6 year old could assemble this dish with minimal adult assistance.

The shrimp tempura roll was fine but nothing special and small compared to what would be found at the average sushi restaurant.  The tuna carpaccio was good (for $26) but overpriced for what it was.  The seaweed salad was good and we also really enjoyed the king crab fried rice but beware that it does have some sort of hidden pork not disclosed on the menu.

Finally, while trying to enjoy a relaxing evening out, it's kind of difficult when the waiter is jacked up on something, and running around like a maniac.

Really, as we dined at this place, I came to realize the reality of Las Vegas, shiny and glitzy on the outside, but in reality built to draw in suckers.  However that's another review for another time.

Not recommended."}
{"text":"I had THE BEST experience at Sushi Roku.
When we went to the location, it was very easy to find and the restaurant was on the third floor of the Forum Shop at Ceasar's Place. The view outside the window was amazing. You can see the whole strip from the dining table if you get sitted by the widow. Perfect spot to go on a date. 

The place seem to be constantly busy but not up to the point where we had to wait a long time to get seated. Our server name Maiko was the best server I ever had from all the different restaurant that I went to. We ordered Omakase with Sake pairing and she seem to be very knowledgeable on the food that she was serving as well as the sake that we had it paired with our sushi. Every time we finished our dish, she would come discreetly to clean our table and get it prepared for the next meal. When she was clearing the table of the empty plates, we were never interupted from our conversation and sometimes I didn't even realize that she took our plates. Our waters are always filled so we never had to ask for more water. Also our sake glasses are always filled as well so that's always a thumbs up~! (We order the bottle of sake and she would always be around to fill it our shot glasses whenever we took our shots) Also every time we get a dish, we always know what we are eating and how we should eat it. Chef that did our omakase came out himself to explain the dishes as well. We also got a chance to meet the Executive Manager of Sushi Roku and got to have conversation with him. 

Finally the food, the sushi qualities are AMAZING~!! Every dish that came out was perfectly balanced and very pleasing to the eyes. We got all different kinds of dishes so our palate were never bored. There was a lot of times where I was getting full but I just had to keep eating because of the food look so appetizing and I just had to try more. 

In the end, the overall experience was AMAZING and it is the go to place if you are craving sushi and happen to be on the Strip at Las Vegas. :D

**I will upload the pictures soon**"}
{"text":"This sushi place was okay. Expensive like everything else on the strip. I had the Crush cocktail which was actually very delicious. Good food that just costs a little too much"}
{"text":"Sushi Roku is one of the must try for those looking to stay in Vegas on a Budget. They apparently have a great happy hour.
Unfortunately, we missed that happy hour by a slight margin, so we were forced to pay the full price. 


Located on the 3rd floor of the 'Forum shops' by Caesars. Just take those winding escalators all the way up. Take in the wow-mazement and gaudiness of it all. 

The quality was very good... no complaints there. 
The plating was typical. Nothing fancy or over the top.
Drinks--Were delicious. Go for one of the cocktails. Not only are they tasty, but make a great palate cleanser. Downside: Not very strong. 

Pricing here is on the higher end if you don't make it during happy hour. That was really only my disappointment. 

Service was good. Not pretentious, or stuffy. 

I think sushi Roku can come off as more frou-frou than it really is. We saw many of people hanging casual in here, despite the high ambiance feeling they try to portray. Then again, that's honestly the entire mall that encompasses this place. So come decked to the nines, or in your tennis shoes. 

Definitely a decent spot for Sushi while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Sushi was pretty good.  Customer service was not bad.  Overall decent place to enjoy sushi..."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi in town. Fresh fish - always ! (not easy in AZ)
We always enjoy the strong drinks . Not much changes in the menu and the specials repeat, so I would like to see more creativity but overall I love this place! 
The bar upstairs should be open for people who eat at the restaurant. You should not sand in line or pay the bouncer to get in after you spent $200 at the restaurant... 
I would definitely recommend trying this place! I think they have great happy hours and summer specials right now. Worth a try !"}
{"text":"I give this place 10* for the quality of sushi. One of the freshest sampling of Uni, Toro, Mirugai, soft shell crab rolls i have every tasted. The reason for 4* is the price. $250 for a party of two is a little pricy. If you are craving sushi and have $$$ than make sure you drop by here and enjoy."}
{"text":"Best meal I have had in Vegas.  The wagu (American) beef skewers and wagu gyoza both excellent.  The three people at the table who got king crab fried rice all said it was excellent.

They also had Japanse wagu on menu although I did not try it.

No wait on a Monday at 6pm even with our party of 8.

Tuna tataki sashimi was fresh and not overcooked.

Wait staff attentive.  

Great choice if you like sushi and even the non sushi afficiandos said they would come back."}
{"text":"The food was GREAT (very fresh and yummy) but our servers - yes, we had about 4 - were about as hot as a bowl of ice cream.  They forgot our edamame.  They were slow with our food and drinks.  They kept switching servers on us.  I guess after hearing so many great things about this place I was expecting more.  

Question:  The table next to us got warm towels for their hands... Were we left out? Do they do this for everyone?"}
{"text":"We didn't have reservations and got seated at the restaurant front facing the Forum. Not really an ideal place since there was someone sitting just outside smoking a cigar from the neighboring restaurant. 

We ordered the following:
Tuna Carpaccio
Chicken Karaage
Shima Roll
Makoto Roll

Everything tasted good except not really worth the price. All four items above totaled $75 plus tip. You are paying a premium for atmosphere. Make sure to reserve and request a table with a view of the strip if you decide to try it out."}
{"text":"Good sushi and sashimi.
Great service.
Excellent ambience and decor.

I had the chef's sashimi combination ($26) and a roll of spicy scallops ($9). Companion had the chef's sushi combination ($29).
I was going for mostly plain and simple, nothing outrageous or innovative. What I got was plain and simple, I felt like I was eating good quality fish. And I'd never had a spicy scallop roll before and liked it.

Our edamame was really good. More firm than most other places I've tried, and I think the firmness was a very good thing.
I also loved the doors to the restrooms, which were designated by beautiful tattooed body art on a man and a woman. 

I did think they were a little stingy on the wasabi and ginger. When we asked for more, the wasabi brought to us was really hard and crumbly, almost gritty. A bit of a mellow harsher there.

With some sake, sapporo, tea, nibbles and our sushi, the bill for two was about $100.
Overall, I thought it was a good meal, but the food itself did not impress me enough to say it was the best I've had. Nowhere near. 
It was similar to what I'd get at restaurants in my own city, but served on black pebbles in a hip atmosphere."}

{"text":"Sushi Roku was a great experience for us.  My boyfriend and I stopped there on the way to a Circ show at the Wynn.  The food was delicious and the service was nice.  I will admit, there wasn't much of a crowd when we went, but that's better for us.  We sat at the sushi bar and asked the chef to create something special for us, and boy did he ever.  He delivered some very fresh sashimi, served with truffles....yummy!  It was not cheap, but so worth it.  It u want cheap, go to sushiRUS!"}
{"text":"Our friends and us wanted to try this restaurant, I have always liked the one in Pasadena....We got seated at a window seat with great views of the strip, very beautiful. 

My gf and I ordered specialty cocktails, both were sweet and refreshing, but a little weak. 

Our food:
Filet Mignon with Ginger Teriyaki Sauce, Japanese style potatoes, sautéed garlic beans: it was cooked perfect to medium rare, hubby liked the sauce, I liked the beans. 

Miso soup: nothing special, it was OK

Premium sashimi (10 pc): they were very fresh and tasty, loved it. 

Our friends food:
3 orders of albacore, baked lobster roll, California roll: I tried a little bit of each dish, they were yummy, but nobody liked the baked lobster roll too much, a little too creamy for our taste. They couldn't even finish their food, kept asking me to eat more. No problem, I love sushi too much. 

The food was delicious, service was great, plus the amazing views, a very pleasant double dinner date, we enjoyed it so much. 

I am a big fan of sushi Roku, it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Outstanding meal here ...  Top shelf service. The Shishito peppers  were ON POINT! Amazing! You must order the American Wagyu potsticker Gyoza appetizer! Beef will melt in your mouth"}
{"text":"Great Sushi. Some of the best I have had in Vegas.  Very creative in their Rolls. Love there Lunch Bento Box. Great portions and very tasty presentation.  The only thing they need to work on is getting the food out quicker.  Lunch took a little longer than it needed to be.  However the manager was excellent about fixing the situation.  Definitely a place I would go back too."}
{"text":"Went there for my daughters birthday. Great ambience and very comfortable round booth seating. Waitress was friendly and very knowledgable about the menu. Made great suggestions and had us excited for the food.

The Kobe beef pot stickers sounded excellent and sadly they were anything but. The wontons were very greasy and chewy. And the Kobe I think was kind of chopped and mixed with something that I would imagine dog food taste like. 

Carpaccio was excellent. King crab miso was pretty good but not a $14 bowl of miso. 

Overall the rolls were very good but I have had better in valley. 

Service and atmosphere excellent. Food just ok to good.

To me ... Definitely overpriced and would probably not return. Nothing great that would make me come back. 

Not bad ... Just not great and for the prices I expect great."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend in for dinner for her birthday, the service was amazing, they wished her a happy birthday by name and service was impeccable. 

The food was delicious, we had the prime rib for dinner and bananas foster for dessert  wish we could have taken pictures of our meal but it was gone too quickly haha. 

Over all it was an amazing night, although it was a bit pricey it was definitely worth it for a night out."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, Thank God!!

We were starving and my friend just finished shoping at the forums, we wanted sushi...wow, this place has it in it's name...

We arrive, no wait...we are sat at the most comfortable table that i have ever sat at, ANYWHERE to top it off, the most amazing view of vegas, it's just perfect

Our server was really cool, wasn't fake or overly nice

I only spent 50 on myself and was full

Definately coming back here again

.....5 stars, but still not as cool as the Geisha House :-)"}
{"text":"I stopped in on my evening walk (read: I was underdressed, not gussied up for a night on the town) on an early Friday evening.  Even so, I was treated to what was - hands down - the best sushi/sashimi experience ever.  I had several dishes. Every one involved incredibly fresh fish with thoughtful use of ingredients with a beautiful presentation.  Each bite delivered often subtle but intricate play of flavors and textures.  The selection of fish was much broader than the usual good sushi restaurant.   All of the wait staff and sushi chefs I encountered were attentive and knowledgable.  And no one made me feel self-conscious that I had arrived in my jeans and walking shoes.  The atmosphere is definitely aimed at attracting the trendy upscale clientele (the W is known generally for it's bar and party scene) but serious sushi fans of all types and ages should make a point of eating here."}
{"text":"5 star dining experience. The sushi was unreal and so was the service. I was very impressed once I walked in to when I left. I will be back with friends!"}
{"text":"Nice food and drink selection. Loved the ambiance. Good for a night out on the town. Located inside the W hotel. Valet parking available. Get your ticket stamped by the restaurant. It reduces the cost of parking."}
{"text":"When you are going to be the only male meeting nine pretty girls from New York City,  you know that your 7 o;clock reservation needs you to call at 7 and ask for it to be pushed back to 730 as you leave your hotel at the other side of the strip.  So imagine when to my surprise I still managed to be the first one there with ample time to sit at the small bar and enjoy the company of the friendly bartender and review their nice selection of wine.  Only out of California for 24 hours, I still missed it enough to settle on a crisp Russian River Sauvignon Blanc.  

By its name, you know that Sushi Roku is Japanese fare with a lot of Sushi options.  If you know me, you know Japanese food falls behind Korean BBQ and anything with \"Steakhouse\" in the title as my least favorite dine out experience.  Nonetheless, I persevered for my sister's birthday weekend wishes, as I did much that weekend.  I was nonplussed to see that they had a seaweed salad that I managed to combine with a few other small items for one full meal.  I did not enjoy how both my miso and salad which ended up being my largest course were both served before anyone else received an appetizer.  Perhaps the gentleman servers were overwhelmed by the prettiness of the nine ladies while I was appreciating the artistic bathroom doors."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku was a very fun atmosphere with pretty great food and a fun way to spend a Friday night in Vegas. We had a group of six eating here and everyone was excited about what they got. Everyone at the table had assorted rolls that they were incredibly happy with (especially the Dynamite Crab Roll). The spicy tuna was VERY spicy, which I love. We also shared the Katana Roll and the shrimp tempura roll, all very yummy. They did find out we were celebrating a birthday at the table and brought us complementary desserts to share. Really fun atmosphere -- only downgrade would be that the service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and supreme service!  Courteous, efficient, and delicious. Beautiful ambiance. The happy hour Menu is perfection. Thanks Raelin. Your service was impeccable. Cheers"}
{"text":"After losing our reservations for a bachelorette party the manager allowed us to come 2 hours later.. 930pm and promised to seat us then. When we got there there was no reservation and nobody knew what we were talking about. When we finally got seated they placed us in a booth and added a chair on the end for the bride... not very special. Service was terrible, food was overpriced and seriously doused in sesame oil and the entire evening seemed like a huge inconvenience to their staff. I will never ever return... pick a place like RA or roaring fork if you like to be treated like a paying customer."}
{"text":"This was a tough sell considering we are from Seattle. 

The restaurant itself was beautiful  The architecture and design of the eating areas was like a work of art.  The staff was very kind and we got our tea and appetizer right away.  We waiting a long time for our sushi dishes.  When they finally did arrive, it was not worth the wait.  The sushi did not seem fresh.  The flavors were lacking.  For a restaurant of this caliber in Caesar's, we were surprised."}
{"text":"Food is average and service below average. Often a long wait after being seated."}
{"text":"An entirely mediocre and underwhelming dining experience. We made a reservation for Saturday night celebrating a family member's birthday and we had pretty high hopes. We can look past the noise, the yelling, the loud music...all of that is fine if the service and food are dynamite. Well, they weren't....with the exception of Kyle the manager who was fantastic.

Our server couldn't have cared less about our non-trendy family: our water glasses stayed empty, there was no \"how is everything?\" or \"can I get you anything?\" 

My steak was so unbelievably salty I sent it back half eaten and she kept it on the bill.

At 7:30 on a Saturday they ran out of salmon and cod. The birthday boy had to order chicken, which was mediocre at best.

The runners had their thumbs in the food when they put the plates down on the table.

A salad was brought over that we didn't order and the runner's response was \"the server told me to just leave it here.\"

They cut a large birthday cake into 5 pieces and served it, I've never seen an individual piece of cake so big in my life.

Kyle stepped in and took excellent care of us which is why I'm adding the extra star, otherwise this was most certainly a one-star dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour on Sunday and everything was great! The bartender was very nice and accommodating. The food here is delicious. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in old town."}
{"text":"I gave them a try on July 4th because I actually had a holiday off for once(Whooo!) but I dislike all things barbecue related. So on this American holiday, I decided to go Japanese..and was glad i did!

The place is somewhat hard to find in the forum shops of Caesars Palace, being on the third floor of a mall that is built to confuse tourists and make them spend more money on high end items that they think they need. Anyway, once it's found, it will be easier to make your way back on the next visit. 

I heard happy hour is amazing, unfortunately I didn't make it in time. But the view of the Las Vegas strip, away from the bar helped ease the pain of missing out on cheap drinks. I still ordered a cocktail but it was a bit overpriced for the size-good nonetheless, just small. 

My group ordered the baked lobster rolls, eel avocado rolls, popcorn shrimp rolls and shrimp tempura rolls  I couldn't complain at all on any of the rolls. Very flavorful and plated beautifully.  The lobster rolls were very different..but good! Definitely worth trying. 

Service was also excellent and my waitress was very helpful with explaining things on the menu. Also, before I was seated, the manager was standing near the front and struck up a conversation with myself and the person i was with. He was surprised to find out we were Vegas locals and let me know that \"locals are always treated well.\" We most certainly were treated well and I will always come back to a place that loves locals! Hopefully next time for happy hour!"}
{"text":"The food was great and incredible but the staff was absolutely rude, condescending and rolled their eyes at someone in our party because she asked for vegetarian information. Made the mood extremely displeasing. 

UPDATE: After speaking with their customer service and their astounding apology. I reconsider my review based on how it was handled. I am still a bit mad to be honest how we were treated at the restaurant but management was extremely accommodating and apologetic. I will give them a higher review based on my experience with management. I would give their other restaurants a try if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Located in the W Hotel in Scottsdale.  Great sushi dishes and a great atmosphere.  I've only been there once but the service was great and the food was very taste and fresh."}
{"text":"We hit up Sushi Roku Saturday night before heading to Pure for my cousin's birthday. We wanted to have a nice meal that will be just enough to fill us without making have to unbuckle my belt and go for a siesta. Since it's inside of Caesar's it's the perfect location to eat before hopping off to the club. The ambiance was lovely, the waiters were uber friendly (and very cute) and the food was top notch. Their Usuzukuri (thinly sliced of fluke with ponzu sauce) is to die for!!! 

It's a bit pricey, but the free birthday dessert of assorted mochi ice cream and the little fireworks show they threw in added that special touch. Be sure to check out their wine list, its ace! I had a phenomenal glass of Riesling that I'm still thirsty for!!!"}
{"text":"Setting is beautiful, service is great, food is delicious."}
{"text":"I recommend the Chefs Sushi plate - delicious and artistic sushi that is a pleasure to eat! The Kobe Beef is delicious as well!!! Yummmm"}
{"text":"Very upscale flavored fish and sushi. Classy ambience great for special occasions and birthdays. Came here with a group while visiting Vegas and was very impressed. We tried assorted sushi, sliders, salmon plates, and dessert. Everything was fantastic. Will definitely be coming back one of my favorite sushi experiences."}
{"text":"Upon entering, we were not sure we'd made a good choice, walking further into the restaurant out reservations settled...the setting is swanky, urban elegant...dim lighting, pretty decor, knowledgeable staff and good food made this a nice experience. We've had better sushi but overall it was a nice experience ."}
{"text":"I was recently in Scottsdale celebrating my bachelorette weekend. Our group of 14 ladies dined at Sushi Roku and all of us highly recommend the restaurant! It was the perfect place for a special night out, and my maid of honor who planned the dinner said the manager was easy to work with. He arranged a pre-fixe menu and every single dish was exquisite! Great value for what we paid. We were seated later than our dinner reservation and the managers brought out a round of drinks on the house, which went a long way in making up for the delay. Dan, the manager who took care of us, is really professional and friendly, and made sure that our group was well taken care of. 

Delicious food and drinks + great service + beautiful ambience = perfect night out with my friends. Thanks for everything!"}
{"text":"\"Jane, you ignorant slut...\" - Dan Aykroyd  

(That's basically what I'm thinking as I read some of these sushi bar reviews.  I mean, who the heck rates a sushi bar based on the distance of the walk to the restaurant or the taste of the 'prime rib' they order there?)

First of all, I think this is about a 3 1/2-Star.  Let me explain why but before I do... I want you, dear reader, to think about an important question:  \"What is the criteria for good sushi?\"  I believe there are some very basic criteria:
-- FRESHNESS
How soft is the fish?  Does it smell?  Is there a slimy texture to it?  Does it melt in your mouth?  And doesn't this depend a lot on when fresh fish arrives?  DUH.  Ladies & gentlemen, I think we just solved the question of \"why are the reviews all over the place for Sushi Roku?\"  
-- CHEF SKILL (Selection, cut, preparation)
What portion of the fish is served to you? And how that portion sliced?  Is it prepared with something in addition to rice, like a plum sauce?  How is the formula for this restaurant's sushi rice?  These are all things that should be considered in looking at sushi because they can all drastically affect the overall meal.
-- PRESENTATION
Does the dish appear appetizing?  What kind of wasabi & nori is used?  Is special sashimi shoyu provided with sashimi dishes?  Sushi that looks unappetizing is just plain poorly made sushi.  A significant part of the experience of dining isn't just eating but the anticipation of eating as well.

The fact is that Sushi Roku's sushi is just \"okay\".  On the days they get their shipment of fish delivered, the quality is very good.  Other days, not so much.  Their chefs aren't bad but like most touristy places in Vegas, you don't form a relationship with the chef.  At best, you get to know the restaurant manager.   What compensates for some of the variation is the fact that Sushi Roku, despite its upper crust placement, is about 20% CHEAPER than the other big name sushi restaurants. (i.e. Nobu)  This difference in cost will be important later when I go over group visits.  The sushi starts them 3-Stars.

What gets them a little more over 3-Stars however are the other things.
-- FOOD/DISHES
They have a fair number of \"group oriented\" dishes both incorporating raw fish or those that are cooked, allowing dinners to be eaten & shared by people who both \"eat sushi\" & \"don't eat raw fish\".  (Here's the menu:  http://www.sushiroku.com/sushiroku/menus/lv.asp) Additionally, the atmosphere is a lot more \"relaxed\" with the pretension & arrogance turned down a few notches, compared to some other sushi joints.   
This makes Roku surprisingly \"party friendly\" for folks doing group get-togethers or Bachelorette Parties, etc. since with the well-balanced menu, everyone can order something cheaply that they'd be willing to eat, & then pass it around w/out getting too dressed up.  You don't comfortably get this in many restaurants in Las Vegas, even Nobu.  
-- SERVICE
The wait staff is okay but what defines Sushi Roku however is Kenji Tamida - General Manager of Sushi Roku, Las Vegas.  Most of the time, you can find the well-dressed Kenji personally greeting & escorting guests like VIPs to their tables along with the hostess, shaking hands, & making people feel welcome.  Kenji has a knack for remembering people & providing that high quality, repeatable touch that is lacking in so many turn-and-burn Vegas restaurants today.  And if you've got a group , he'll even sit & have a drink with you if you ask him to & tell you about what's hot in the city, 'cause he's a high profile partier too.  Ask him, & he just might be able to point you to the quickest way to the party, if you know what I mean.  If you stop by, be sure to say hi to him by name & tell him you read about him on Yelp.  He'll take care of you.
-- DECOR
The décor is similar to what you'd see in Nobu, Yellowtail, etc.  What's nice is that the restaurant is configurable for groups of 4 all the way to 30+.  Additionally, their view is great:  It hangs directly over the Las Vegas Strip & give you a rare up-close 3 story view of everything going on while you're dining.   Be sure to make a reservation for a window seat.  

BONUS:  For some reason, a lot of bachelorette parties come here.  I think it's because Roku's known for being a quieter, less dressy, lower profile place & thus I've seen as many as 3 parties going on at the same time, each with the signature wedding veil on the bride to be.

CONCLUSION:
I want to stress that you're not going to go back to Roku over & over for the food.  While it's decent, it's stil a notch below places like Nobu & Yellowtail.  Ultimately, however it's an all-around good place for groups, birthday parties, bachelor parties, etc., w/ a good balance of raw & cooked dishes w/ something for everyone, personal attention from the management, an unbeatable view, & consistently less lower prices than other sushi houses.

{"text":"Finally was able to ditch the kiddies & have a date night w/ the hubby (who is a sushi snob).  I was craving for some exotic stuff and was not going to waste it on some rock n rock sushi bar.  Sushi Roku didn't disappoint.  The sushi case was filled most variety of fish that I've seen since my days living in S. Cali.  Since dinner happens to land during their summer happy hour (wow...it's cheap) we did a mix between the 2 menus.  

Oysters 3 ways - all I remember is the one with hami, hami oyster with uni & caviar (5*) ...OMG, I will be dreaming about this dish for a very long time. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=n3aVAzN_-SyGAdkuLyb4Ew

Halibut Special (5*) - thinly slice halibut on ice (tender, slightly chewy, with a light flavor) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DwP10iEz5LGf3fhcVQZm0Q?select=Fb5juM08pTBbFGH1WKtD8g

Seared Blue Fin Tuna with white truffle oil, micro arugula & parmesan cheese (5*) - the Spanish blue fin just melted in my mouth..yum!

Zuke Hawaiian big eye tuna (5*) - the marinated tuna has the perfect balance of ginger, tamari & maui onion

From the HH menu - 
- Bacardi Moitos (5*) & Skyy Voka Fusion (5*)
-Spicy yellowtail  roll (4*) 
-California rolls (5*) - where else can you score real crab meat Calirolls for $3.50!?!??!
-Asian BBQ Short Ribs (2*) - way too salty & tasted like liver
- Calamari with ponzu (2*) - kinda of under cooked...not crispy at all

The service was awesome and ambiance was perfect (guess it's more causal during HH).  Yes, the raw stuff was kinda of pricey but worth every penny.  I hope I won't have to wait too long for another date night ....*sigh*"}
{"text":"Incredible food. Great atmosphere. John the general manager is very professional and curtious"}
{"text":"Sushi was decent, service excellent and best of all, love the hours of happy hour.  The spicy garlic edamame was amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and had the omakase which runs about 120$. Seating was by the bar but at the corner and not in front of chef. The music was loud so it was really hard to hear what was in the dishes when they were brought out. It was 6 courses which each course having 1 piece of sushi with the exception if sushi sampler and meat dish. 
1st was the tofu and some fish dish that had a spicy taste to it which was my favorite of the night
2nd was the seared scallops with butterscotch  sauce
3rd was the sashimi with tuna and another type of fish. Also tasted great.
4th was some type of steak on top of mushrooms and onions
5th and final was 6 piece sushi sampler
6th was dessert which was creme brulee

Overall it was tasty but menu wasn't huge and still was a bit hungry after and also which there was better communication about what's in the dish considering the price."}
{"text":"The food was really good! I'm glad we stumbled upon this place and tried it. It was everything I needed to get my sushi fix. Our server Juliana made it a delightful visit. She was very attentive and friendly. We will definitely be back!"}

edamame, various plates of sashimi, bunch of rolls. all excellent food.
never expected such good sushi in the desert (scottsdale, az)"}
{"text":"Uni. All day long. Uni @ $5 per piece. Uni from Santa Barbara. Uni that melted in my mouth.

I preferred the nigiri over the rolls.

Fun place with what appears to be a good happy hour menu. Decently priced bottles of bubbly. Gets loud on weekends, but it's the W and to be expected."}
{"text":"Food: 4 Stars
Service: 3 Stars

I give it a total of 3.5 but I always round down.

Thursday night we had reservations at 8:45 PM. Did not get seated until 9:10 PM so the reservations did not have much help. The ambience is nice, dimly light, bar near the front, big open space.

Food:
Sashimi - VERY fresh, this is probably the best thing on the menu. We ordered Salmon, Tuna, Yellowtail, etc. all very good.

Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus - this was a nice treat, beef was tender, and well marinated.

Kobe Potstickers - nothing special, save your money. Don't get it.

All of their rolls were nothing special.

Chilean Seabass - This was very very good. I highly recommend this.

Overall the FOOD is good, just the service wasn't the best. This review is based on food + service. I recommend this restaurant if it was based on Food only."}
{"text":"We heard great things about Sushi Roku and decided to try it.  The space is great, beautiful strip view, but it ends there.  Service was less than spectacular, and the food was nothing special.  Rolls were very uninspired, sushi/sashimi was ok but nothing great.   I've had much better experiences at Blue Ribbon and Nobu."}
{"text":"The sushi sucked.
The service sucked. 
Food presentation was awful. 
The cocktails rock.

The best thing about this place is that it is connected to the W Hotel. 

Visit Roku solely for the cocktails and ambiance, eat prior."}
{"text":"ok im giving one star because i came for my birthday and the loser waiter didnt give me free drinks. ugh so mad. the food is super expensive. but i got the katana roll and tofu appetizer. it was soo good. that is all. and they spelled happy birthday wrong."}
{"text":"Really awesome robata sea bass skewers. The katana roll is fantastic. Short rib was done really well. Overall great service and happening atmosphere. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I ever head coupled with excellent customer service. This is a proper restaurant"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great atmosphere! Sarah was above and beyond accommodating.  I can't eat gluten, which makes sushi restaurants next to impossible. Tons of GF options.  If my table ordered something not GF Sarah made sure to let me know as it came in. She was so kind and made this experience truly something to enjoy! Thank you! ( five times, Mike! That girl needs a promotion) ;)"}
{"text":"What an enjoyable dining experience! The service - Tim was my waiter - was extraordinary!! Engaging, good suggestions, and sincerely interested in how I was enjoying the food. Ok... the sushi rolls are just average. The Katana roll was puzzling in that it reminded me of a manufactured sushi roll offering at my local grocery store... it was NOT even interesting let alone compelling. The tuna/avocado roll was much better... simplicity is their strong suit. The tuna belly (Toro) was SUPERB! What's not to love? The surprise of the evening were the Brussels Sprouts. Order these 1st with a cocktail and study the menu. They are the perfect starter.

Note to self: I'll stick with the sushi in the future and forego the rolls. The guys behind the sushi counter know what they're doing... and the fish is über fresh! But most important - I'll ask to sit at one of Tim's tables!"}
{"text":"This place is great for groups. We were a party of 12 girls for a bachlorette party and spotted 3 others that same night. Service was wonderful and I must say it is no easy task to please that many gals. 

The non sushi dishes were perfect but the plate of sashimi and rolls was just average. The server underestimated a few of my friends' appetite including myself. We were still hungry after our omakase and had to order ramen.....good bowl of noodle, I must say. 

Note the kobe beef on hot stones is a MUST."}
{"text":"Just had a business dinner here the other night.  It is located in the shops at Caesars Palace.  This is the second time that I have at there, but I will focus my review on this past visit.

We had a sample menu with a variety of different appetizers and entrees, so we really ate much of the menu.  For sushi on the Las Vegas strip, this place would get four stars from me.  I normally hate spicy tuna rolls, but I absolutely loved this one!  The rest of the food was just as impressive. 

Now the bad.  First, the service was only ok.   There wasn't anything that stood out as really horrible, but for the price of the restaurant I would have expected more, especially in Las Vegas.  Also, I am really into my wine, and this place gets an \"F\" for  their wine list.  There was nothing that really was appealing, and the cab I ended up trying was so bad that I changed to Sapporo.  

Overall, nice place to have some sushi while you are in the Caesars area.  Maybe you would have a little better experience than I did with the service only focusing on 2-4 people instead of 20-25."}
{"text":"We got the shishito peppers, yellowtail dice chilies, hanabi, spicy pork belly fried rice, and uni udon. The hanabi was perfect. The spicy pork belly fried rice was ok but a little too sweet. Uni udon was not what we expected and more like Alfredo but tasty."}
{"text":"I have just experience food heaven and a food coma all in one! I have always wanted to try this place because I have heard such good things. Their sunset menu before a show at the Gammage Theater was the perfect excuse. Honestly it was such a good deal for so much food and such tasty options. I went with my sister and we each tried something different off the menu and shared. For starters we got the edamame hummus and garden salad. The wonton chips with the hummus were so good and the salad was so light and refreshing. 

For the second course I got the vegetable tempura and popcorn shrimp. Both of which were good, but I would go with the shrimp. The vegetable tempura was good but a bit heavy before the final course. 

I got the salmon as my main course and my sister got the filet. The salmon was perfectly cooked, but I didn't need the rice and the sauce was slightly too sweet for me. The filet was so good with a great teriyaki sweet sauce and perfectly smooth mashed potatoes. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful in our selections and the ambiance was nice. Not super crowded but we had an early reservation. I want to go back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I was referred here from a friend.  We went this past weekend and it was good sushi.  Nothing out of this world but good.  The waiter was cool, we had some great cocktails!  He then brought us the regular glass water.... OMG it was the dirtiest tasting water.  I thought it was just me but then my girlfriend said her water tasted dirty.  I tried hers and sure enough it was gross.  We told the waiter and he agreed the water was not good there.  We asked him why didn't he tell us and he said because he didn't want us thinking he was trying to sell us a bottle of water.  SOLD!!! we asked for a bottle of FIGI.  For an upscale place like this the regular / tap water was the nastiest I have had in Vegas.  

Anyways!  sushi was gooooooooooooood, over priced but still good and I would go there again and bring water or drink sake instead."}
{"text":"At here about a month ago with my wife & cousin before catching a red eye flight.  Food was a 10.  Great menu, great service, excellent atmosphere.  Its attached to Boa Steakhouse and has similar look & feel (& service).  You will find a diverse crowd...mostly hipsters and dates...pretty trendy overall.

I think this place is on par with the high-end Japanese restaurants in vegas like Nobu.  Will definitely return again.

{"text":"3.5 really.  Good sushi and it seemed fresh.  But...the service was not good at all.  I was asked to move at the sushi bar when I first sat down (still not sure why as I was the ONLY person at a 20+ person bar).  The food took not too long, but I had to ask to get a drink refill.  

I had the sushi lunch special $17.  Overpriced, but hey this is Scottsdale.

Many people raved about this place but it's like an overpriced RA Sushi.  

I won't be back...to many other choices."}
{"text":"It just keeps getting  better. It's like being transported to heaven  

Haru is one amazing chef."}

{"text":"great sushi. Fresh fish. Their toro was particularly good. Did not like their hanabi. Everything else tasted amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and I were shocked at how mediocre this place was! Based on great reviews we were expecting great sushi and it just wasn't. The place was pretty dead for a Saturday night, I guess that should have been a sign. We had two rolls both were okay, nothing special. The sashimi was good. Service sucked. Total waste of money."}
{"text":"I have to say it was a bit difficult to find since its under the W hotel and if you don't pay attention you'll miss it. 
Parking was a bit difficult as well and it was only Sunday night but it was worth it. 
Nice atmosphere and the staff is very accommodating and helpful. 
The food is delicious and the fish is so fresh and the portions are just right. 
It's def worth another visit since we know where it is now : )"}
{"text":"Average sushi joint at best. Showed up late which is a plus but had to wait for a 6top. That's pretty lame when there are so many open tables. We drank and ate and the food and service was good. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back with all the options out there but it was good enough to stop in again. Groups are rampant in Vegas so be prepared for them. Don't make them stand out front in ask way fashion while you quote 25min. Most people will leave. Invite us in to chill and we would've had a round of cocktails. Details really. All in all a good start to the night."}
{"text":"Doesn't even need a review. Just go. Get the yellowtail sashimi with ponzu appetizer and thank me later. ;-)"}
{"text":"The service we received was incredible. The yellowtail carpaccio was one of the best appetizers I've ever had. We loved the sake as well! I will definitely be returning soon. It was an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Went with 8 girls and spent $340. Not bad for Vegas. 

Pros:
Great sushi, even though you're in the middle of the desert.
Good drinks.
Seaweed salad supposedly amazing, says two of my friends.
Atmosphere +++
Squishy seats at the booths. 

Cons:
You're not really going to feel full after eating here unless you're dropping some serious money. 
Skip the miso soup, sooo not worth $1, let alone $4

What we really liked about it is that we got a free dessert sampler thanks to a chef a friend knew and we didn't have to go far to hit up Pure. Good times."}
{"text":"Came in here about five o clock. A friend of mines made a reservations because I've read reviews saying this place is awesome and crowded.... It was a ghost town. I thought they said happy hour on Sundays? I guess not. The sushi was ok. My rainbow roll wasn't really a rainbow roll. It had waaaaaaaaaay too much avocado on top and no fish?! Literally 5 rolls were avocado and 3 actually had fog on top, with a little bit of avocado. 

Our server sucked big time. We were done with our food and he didn't  come to give us our bill. IT WASN'T EVEN BUSY. My friend was drunk and impatient. So I told her we will meet her outside. It took a while. YIKES.

I was pretty excited to go here because I live in California and wanted sushi so bad. I didnt know vegas much. It was a whatever experience here. Née going back. Both my friend and girlfriend made fun of me because I was super excited for this \"awesome\" place..... Fail!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi but pretty pricey!
I had a dynamite roll that was not bad. I believe it was $14 for 8 small pieces. I guess you're paying for Vegas prices."}
{"text":"This place is in the Forum Shops so the location and view of the strip are the attraction.  Don't valet in front of Caesar's, go to the right of Caesar's (as you are approaching it and driving towards the valet area) and there is a driveway on your right.  Take that and it puts you in front of a steakhouse with valet.  Go to the 3rd level and there it is.  Nice place, great view, and the service seemed to be very good.  It wasn't busy for lunch though.  I had the basics - miso soup, yellow tail and halibut sashimi, and tuna nigiri.  It was all fresh and very good.  It is an expensive place though relative to sushi that can be had elsewhere.  If you're going to spend that much you may as well go to Nobu in the Hard Rock.  Nobu has marginal atmosphere but good crowds and great sushi.  I would come back here but only for dinner on a busy night."}
{"text":"Not bad for Vegas.  But is that really what you want when you're splurging on vacation?   I came here looking for an authentic Japanese meal.  They tell you the fish is flown in from Japan.  And to tell the truth, the food is not bad, it's just nothing special.  It's Americanized touristy stuff, without the exotic fish one finds in establishments that target connoisseurs.  The fish was certainly fresh, but that was not enough to overcome the abominable service.  That was unJapanese enough to ruin the meal.  The waitress didn't know the menu and had to go find the answers to our questions, until we got tired of asking.  Why is she even serving if she doesn't know what she's presenting to the customers?  We tried to ask the sushi chef about the menu, but his English was limited and he based his suggestion on how we could save money, when instead we wanted him to knock our socks off.  Then the bus boy took our plates away while we were still eating, which is downright rude.  I felt like just another tourist passing through a shiny hollow Vegas cash drainer.  I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the salmon nigiri and Toro jalapeno. Sushi chef was great!

From caesers walk into forum shops near food court  and hang a right at fountains. Kind of difficult to find the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi for happy hour. Daddy & I ate some rolls with soy paper. We had fun eating at the happy hour."}
{"text":"A very modern restaurant on the third floor of the Forum Shops. With such a high price piece of real estate you expect the prices to be a little higher then a normal sushi bar. 
I don't mind paying a little extra as long as the fish is top quality. 
The fish was real tender and full of flavor. 
We had tuna, yellow tail, albacore, shrimp tempura hand rolls and spicy scallops.
Great location
Great Sushi"}
{"text":"The food here is way overpriced. You are paying for the location and the atmosphere. I've tried lots of sushi and this wasn't even that good. I might give it a better review if the food was actually decent but you don't even get your money's worth. I will stick with sushi brokers as my go to sushi spot."}
{"text":"The baked crab rolls were excellent!   I went here mid-afternoon and it was nearly empty, but the service was great, and I sat at the sushi bar.   Fun to watch them make your rolls right in front of you."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is very beautiful and the service is excellent but the food leaves a lot to the imagination. My wife and I go to a great sushi restaurant every Wednesday in the city of Alameda CA and I ordered the same thing that I always order and am used to paying about $37.50. What I got at Roku was about 1/2 the quanity and about !/2 the quality. The Nigri pieces were cut very thin and the Chirashi pieces were also cut very thin and the quanity was very sparce. We received a bill without the tip for $97.40. What a rip off to say the least. I wasn't expecting it. I guess this restaurant is only for turists who probably never ate sushi or will never go back. I sure would not go back or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Craving sushi in Phoenix is probably a death wish.  (Sorry Phoenix people, I'm from California where there's sushi galore!)  I couldn't find any decent sushi nearby, and since I was staying near the W, I yelped and found Sushi Roku!! (Thanks again yelpers!)  

We got there in time for happy hour and enjoyed $5 appetizers and discounted rolls.  I had a bellini, my husband had a beer and we had a ton of food to share between us.  Delicious.  A little bit more on the pricey side, but very fresh and tasty.  

It also made me feel better that this restaurant is a sister restaurant to Sushi Roku in Los Angeles (one of my friends' favorite places in LA).  :)

Hmmm...just noticed some yelpers had breakfast here. Ew...sushi for breakfast just sounds kind of wrong!"}
{"text":"I have to say that the sushi didn't \"wow\"
me...unfortunately!  I expected more for the price.  The ambiance almost made up for it as it had and absolutely beautiful, zen like decor and a view of the strip.  Our server was very friendly and gave great suggestions.  The yellowtail he recommended was fantastic, but, again, nothing out of the 10 sushi orders was anything I would come back for.  I enjoyed Nobu more."}
{"text":"We hit Sushi Roku before the Elton John show. We had 5:30 reservations but had to move them to 6pm in order to dine with a strip view table (only available after 6pm.) Happy Hour drink specials were great as was the wait staff. We were left wanting more, as the food was pretty average. The food quality was good but there was no \"Vegas Flare\" to the menu."}
{"text":"I did a reservation through yelp for about 9 people on a Saturday. 

I have to say I was blown away by the service here. We got an awesome server who was very attentive and accommodating. Water was always full and the food and other things we requested came in a timely matter.They accidentally forgot the birthday girl's dish, but was able to provide her with a free dish to make up for it. 

I got the Tako roll with the spicy octopus and salmon sashimi and both were delicious and tasted fresh. I also tried my friend's miso butter-fish dish wow! It was so soft and flavorful. 
The birthday girl got a trio of pastry dessert and a candle to blow out to make her birthday extra special. A nice finishing touch to a great dining experience.

Atmosphere was pretty nice too - upscale ambiance. I would return when I go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in a while!

I won't spoil the surprise of the multi-course Omakase, but WOW, was it an experience. Apart from standard Sashimi/Nigiri/sushi fare, you're fed some very, VERY delicious dishes that I've personally never had served to me quite like this before. Okay, so it's not traditional Japanese fare, but it's extremely appetizing never-the-less.

A hint... King Crab w/ Champagne Butter? OMG YES."}
{"text":"This place bills itself as a scene, and on that level it doesn't disappoint: it's a restaurant with the feel of a nightclub, with big groups of dressed-up guys and gals celebrating among themselves and even, as we saw, sometimes in the direction of other tables. The sushi is top-quality, especially for the price, so no complaints there. The service was friendly if a little disorganized, and the drinks were overpriced. Pretty much exactly what you'd expect."}
{"text":"I had one of the lunch specials and was very satisfied. In particular I had a bento box with chicken, salad, rice and tempura. Everything was very delicious and filling. I also sampled one of the rolls was pleased and wished I'd gotten that as well. To drink I had a sparkling saki which was small but very good if you like sweet drinks. I would come back to try the rolls next time."}
{"text":"Do you like sushi? Do you consider yourself sort of a sushi pro? Then check out Roku. It is creative, fresh, fun, and an excellent dinner spot. If you can get a table by the window, you might have a great view of the strip. The service is attentive and professional, the wines are great, and the sushi is extremely good. I've been to a few sushi places in Vegas...all are good....this is the best."}
{"text":"I've only been to Vegas twice and both times we came here - my favorite sushi place ever!  Great food, great service, love the location.  We brought 15 people with us  and they've all been back!  The chef's selection was amazing and looking out on the strip was great.  I highly recommend and can't wait to get back on my next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite sushi restaurants.  The service is very attentive and helpful.  My husband and I tried the chef's 6 course tasting menu and it was fantastic.  My favorite course consisted of the oysters with 3 different sauces.  Yummy! We will defenitely return the next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'll admit I went here out of convenience, 100%. I was staying at the W for a conference, needed to get some work done, so I got takeout and took it up to my room. I got three pretty straightforward items: edamame, yellowtail sashimi with diced chiles (supposedly a \"specialty of the house\"), and the tuna jalapeno hand roll - and was underwhelmed with all of them. 

The texture of the edamame was off on about half of the pods I got - grainy and not moist at all. The pieces that were prepared well were actually delicious, with just the right amount of salt. But WTH, why was half of it wonky? 

The yellowtail sashimi was completely overpowered by the sauce it was covered in. Don't get me wrong, the flavors were good, just completely imbalanced. Way too much sauce, and somehow, something with diced chiles didn't even have a hint of spice to it. The yellowtail was sliced so thin that it was unrecognizable even as fish, and the sauce effectively cooked it. This is a dish I particularly love, that my favorite sushi restaurant at home serves perfectly, so I was very disappointed.

These two dishes behind me, I move on to my tuna jalapeno roll. Based on its name, I'm expecting a very clean, crisp roll. When I open the box, I am accosted with huge dollops of spicy mayo on top of each piece. I dab it off so that the roll looks vaguely appetizing, if a bit smeared. I've never tasted a roll so bland in all my life. Apparently that's why it was swimming in mayo - to give it some flavor. Also, it was supposed to come with toro, but they were out of toro and subbed regular tuna, but charged me the same. Toro is a lot more expensive than regular tuna, so I wasn't thrilled about that, but I was expensing dinner, so the cost was really didn't matter. 

That said, if I was actually spending my own money, I definitely would not spend it here. Yeah, I'm not from Arizona, I've always lived by some water, so maybe this is the best you can do here, but I really doubt it."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype.  
$16 dollars for 4 skinny pieces of salmon sashimi. Bogus. If you are going to drop dollars, don't do it here.  It may be an awesome restaurant for LA, but it didn't work for me in Las Vegas. 

Reservation highly recommended.  Even then, hope for the best! 
We had to wait over 30 minutes for our food, hungry. It didn't help that we saw tables seated after us getting food before us. 
From what I gather, everything else that was ordered was good:  the halibut fish special, the ramen, the chicken skewers, and the sushi were delightful.  If it wouldn't of been for the the wait, you may have seen 3 stars from me.  
If you are a party of 6 or more, 20% gratuity will be automatically tacked on to your bill, regardless the situation. 

Luckily for us, our waiter couldn't refute the mistakes and updated our bill.  Too bad he ended up with a couple of dollars, but maybe next time....a little more communication or some chips and salsa please...well you know what I mean. 

Drinks seemed appetizing, the bar staff was friendly, and the hostess was nice.   My company of 5 HOT woman made up for my meal."}
{"text":"No one receives five stars from me.

I narrowed down the search for sushi by searching yelp within Old Town Scottsdale for sushi joints with two $$ and below. This one fit my budget for happy hour only. After happy hour, this place is too expensive for my budget.

Here, I order several things off of the the happy hour menu. My first choice was the albacore Sashimi with the ponzu sauce. I was very impressed by the flavor of the sashimi, and the fried/crisped slivered onion strips were a wonderful and not overpowering garnish. However I felt that the albacore was a little bit too thin. Not enough substance. 

Next, I also ordered the spicy tuna hand roll - and boy was it spicy! It had a very good combination of spiciness and flavor it was not overpoweringly spicy, and the roll was of a decent size. Same deal with the salmon skin roll. Nice and salty just like how I like my salmon skin, and ditto with the size of the roll. A good solid flavor to the salmon skin - good taste. 

I must admit that I ordered doubles of the wagyu beef on a skewer. The beef was well-cooked, not too fatty, nice and tender, and with lots of sauce on it. The sauce was delish, and the meat was very flavorful and cooked very well (not well-done, but just slightly less than medium). I ordered two skewers, but in all fairness, may not be worth $7 each skewer. 

I do slightly regret not trying out the edamame hummus and spicy edamame, but I ordered enough happy hour selections to make me satisfied and empty my wallet, so I quit while I was ahead.

Keep in mind that, at this joint, you pay for the vibe and the rent just as much as for the food and service. I gladly paid, but it's not something I can afford on a regular basis.

The staff was very attentive. I had no less than three very good looking waitresses waiting on me as well as two other waiters. My food came instantly after I ordered it within about a couple of minutes after each order. And every time they brought the meal out to me they gave a brief description of what it was that I was receiving. 

All of the waiters and waitresses seem very happy and I believe they are well-paid this place is a very well-run operation the employees are very professional and the appearance of the restaurant is very good and clean.

 I do like the food dear however I would limit my purchases to happy hour it also helps that they have very good music and lighting inside the restaurant which produces a very nice relaxing ambiance"}
{"text":"Roku doesn't disappoint in terms of freshness.  The sushi however lacks any innovation in terms of combining ingredients and wowing the taste buds.

The entrees are all decadent and savory on the taste buds but the steak is a bit over drenched in salt and oil.  

The desserts on the other hand are scrumptious and to die for."}
{"text":"Thieves!  Had a nice business meal a couple weeks ago.  Spent close to $700 that evening. But when I got my credit card statement they added an additional $300!  What the server or manager did was changed the first digit of the tip!! Called the manager and he responded with \"oops\".  Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Well, after being in AZ for the week and being pleasantly surprised at the low price of our restaurant/bar bills, we finally ate/drank a $200 meal. Hubby insisted on trying a sushi place in Scottsdale because of the sheer number and high rankings. I dubiously complied. While you won't find anything exotic or too creative, you will find a solid selection and freshness as long as you remember there's no ocean front property in AZ. The sushi chef was a young man from Japan and the waitress was super nice. The restaurant is located inside a W Hotel with a corresponding atmosphere.
Here are the turn offs: 1. I caught something moving out of the corner of my eye on my chopstick. I chased the bug down under my plate and didn't know what to do but smash it with my napkin. I did not want to look too close, flagged the waitress down and she took care of it wiping down and replacing my dinnerware. 2. Shishito peppers are drowning in a sauce that is overwhelmingly sweet and even more overwhelmingly salty. The menu does not indicate they are in a \"sauce\" and I expected them sprinkled with sea salt as I've usually had in other places. 3. I had the great misfortune of being seated where I had a bird's eye view of someone who was obviously a regular and her dinner companions shoving their tongues down each other's throat. Sigh, judgmental yes, but just not what I want to see while eating dinner and nothing the restaurant can do about that. Keeping in mind the context, if we are ever in the mood for sushi in Scottsdale again, we would return."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi rolls I've had in my entire life!!!

This place is a must... and even better because it's inside the W Hotel : )"}
{"text":"Best of the best. The quick fried nori is incredible, the spicy tuna on crispy rice (hanabi), the king crab fried rice, the fabulous rib eye... I can go on and on. Coupled with attentive and friendly service, this is the place to go. Congratulations to Johnny and his team, for not just the food and service, but the amazing consistency."}
{"text":"I failed to find any flaws in my Sushi Roku experience last weekend. 

The designers of this place had a clear vision of what they wanted in mind, and they executed it with complete, meticulous precision. You can dislike that vision if you want, because you hate Scottsdale's douchebaggery or whatever the case may be. But then, I would question why you'd bother to come here in the first place. 

The environment was typical of W's I've seen around the country: upscale, chic, a bit clubby, all the things that attract male douches and female hotties. The service was professional and prompt. The sushi was the best I've ever had in the desert with the glaring exception of Yasu. The bill for four of us was well over 200 bucks before tip, but we left happy because we got what we paid for."}
{"text":"You have got to be kidding me... Sushi Roku is ridiculous!  Ridiculously BAD, that is!  In fairness,  I give them one star for the service and another star for the ambiance (the restaurant is really gorgeous; if you sit in front of the windows, you get an amazing view of the strip).  But OMG, this place way overpriced!  I had dinner with 2 friends and it came to $300!  What the hell?!  The rolls were small and really not that special, and most importantly, they were NOT FRESH!  The nigiri looked like it had been sitting out all day!  Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"While I would opt for Nobu if I could, Sushi Roku is a GREAT second choice in Vegas. I come here every time I visit. The sushi is fresh and delicious. I generally never have to wait for a seat. A touch on the pricey side - but it is Vegas. Order the tofu steak as an appetizer. Overall a huge fan. I've also been to the Sushi Roku in Pasadena - like the one in Vegas better.

UPDATE: Went back again today for lunch. The Uni and Hotate was awesome. Love the consistency..."}
{"text":"Extremely tasty, nice ambiance, and good #customerservice. However, small rolls, can be a bit pricey, but a cute little date spot."}
{"text":"Rolls were okay.

Hamachi okay.

Seabass was overcooked for my taste. but okay.

should've went to nobu..."}
{"text":"This review is a little stale.  Its been a few months, but Sushi Roku popped up as a place I had not reviewed yet.  The sushi?  Great.

That's not what this review is about.  Everyone at my table had been drinking, except me, the night in question.

We ordered up, I collected cash from everyone, and I paid the balance on my card.

When we got the bill back to sign - I noticed it was a little light.  10 dollars was missing from the cash amount.  What ensued was a debacle of the waitress trying to tell me that I counted the money wrong (I didn't) and looking around under the table for the missing money.

I have seen this scam before, and I am sure it works great on drunk patrons.  Not so great on sober ones.  I didnt want to waste anymore time so I just took the 10 bucks out of her tip and we headed out the door.

She chased us down to tell us she found the 10 dollars under the table.

The same one we just looked under with flashlights while she was inside.

I have told several friends about this - and I dont think we will be back.  I can only imagine how many other people have probably been ripped off like this.  After all - it's only 10 bucks, who will notice?

This cheap bastard.  That's who."}
{"text":"Service was out of this world. I haven't been to a restaurant in town with this level of great employees in a long time. attentive, refilled drinks quickly without being asked, and kept the table satisfied with the entire experience. The table had a variety of sashimi, lobster, steak and dessert. The best part was the fried rice with spicy tuna on top. While pricey, you are taken care of for certain! Giving it four stars only because of the cost."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best sushi I've ever had. Not just in Vegas, but all over the world. Everything is so fresh and the dishes are unique and delicate. Well worth the price when you want the best sushi experience."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for almost 2 years now and...I LOVE IT. Joy, Lauryn, Lisa and Ryann are AMAZING. Their entire staff has been more than accommodating. Overall the place has a great energy. I will continue to come here and I recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice environment and great food."}
{"text":"Kinda pricey but food is amazing.
Located on the first floor of the W Hotel in Scottsdale, this is the best place for Japanese food.  Very well presented but of course the prices are a little higher than I like to pay for Sushi. 
Very dark atmosphere but that goes for the entire hotel so it's no surprise the restaurant is dark as well. Very comfortable seating and great service.  The waitress always was attentive to my needs. (and attractive too!)
Since I am only here for work I try to take advantage of the immediate area but I always end up back at this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are from Vancouver and knew we would be eating a heap of fast food on our trip to Vegas, so scoped out the top Japanese restaurants in Vegas ahead of time. Sushi Roku was one of the top on the list, and as we passed by it during the day at Caesar's Palace, the decor looked lovely, as did the menu.

I was really impressed with the ambiance of the place - it looked like it could fit 150 people easily and the furniture and light fixtures were grandiose. It was quiet on a Monday night, but allowed us to take in the spectacular night view of the strip. We started off with some edamame, Ingen Itame (Sauteed Chinese green beans with garlic sauce, $8), and Miso Eggplant Dengaku ($10) which were already really good. The eggplant was sweet tasting and crispy on the outside (Leo pointed out that it's because they removed most of the skin) but soft on the inside. Leo also ordered some Kobe Gyoza ($12) on special, which he was barely able to touch because of the entrees we ordered.

Since this place is named for its sushi, I tried out the Eel Avocado roll ($9) and Garden vegetable roll ($12). The eel roll was pretty standard, nothing better than what I think I could get in Vancouver, but no complaints. The thing about the veggie roll was that it had a pretty strong japanese herb called Mizuna which is in between mint and cilantro. Not what my tastebuds normally like.

Leo's choices were the special Baked lobster roll with creamy miso ($21) and the special Spicy crunchy shrimp roll ($18) which had tempura batter-like crumbs sprinkled over it. That was my favourite roll and definitely something I hadn't ever tried before. Leo wasn't impressed by the lobster, I think just because it was the most expensive and didn't really live up to the gourmet taste he was expecting. Most dishes involving lobster in the USA are pretty costly.

In the end we had to take home most of the pieces and had no room for dessert. The service at Sushi Roku was excellent - we aren't used to having one staff take orders and check-in and another serving food and drinks, so that was a bonus for us. The server even folded Leo's napkin when he went out to the restroom.

The only thing that lacks the extra star for this review was the dark corner table we had that made it almost impossible to read the menu in candlelight, and the just-above average rolls that were priced more than we'd usually pay at a restaurant in Vancouver.

All in all, not a bad place to try if you're craving some sushi, have some money to spend, and want a romantic place to dine at with a great view of the strip."}
{"text":"Meh, sushi is not that great and they raised their prices over the last few years.   I get that commodity prices have risen but $15 for a sub par spicy tuna roll?  No thanks.  Also, the servers are not very professional and don't seem to communicate.  We were asked to order drinks and dinner twice and we paid our bill then a different server dropped off our bill asking us to pay when we are ready.  Total bill was $100.  I would rather eat at a fine dining restaurant like Mastro's or Del Frisco's.  Twice the price but better service."}
{"text":"I have been to Sushi Roku twice and had an ok experience each time. I sat in the front area on one of my trips, which felt like I was paying high prices to eat sushi in a mall (because basically, that's what I was doing). If possible, asked to be seated in the back area. The setting is dark and romantic, and the windows showcase a spectacular view of the city. On a scale from 1-5, I would rate the sushi here a 3.5. Fairly middle of the road with a few nice surprises. I eat mostly raw rolls, and their menu has a lot of cooked rolls on it, which they were willing to modify for me, but the menu selection was quite small. If you are debating between Nobu and Suski Roku for sushi, let this place be the winner. Overall, not a bad place to visit, but if I come back to Vegas, I will likely check out a new place for sushi."}
{"text":"This was the beginning of my birthday / NYE night at the W Hotel.
Gorgeous, ambient,  classy restaurant with a beautiful flow. 
Love the booth seating and the place is super clean with a very upscale feel, it is a perfect addition to The W.

We were a party of 8 and we had reservations -we were warmly greeted and promptly seated. Solid menu which also includes non sushi options(plus GF.) We had a few apps to share at our table - Filet wrapped asparagus, Edamame, Hummus, Oysters, Seared albacore. The wrapped asparagus was delicious and tender,  the Hummus and wonton's were a big hit as well. The oysters and albacore were fresh and yummy.
Besides having a really nice menu they have a wonderful selection of Sake's and Asian martini's .

I knew i would be drinking so i steered clear of having sushi for dinner, so instead i had a fabulous Prime rib served with a super yum garlic sauce, my dining companions had the sushi assortment and the Lobster, scallops and prawns ..all plates were presented well and were delicious .Service was outstanding, they really took care of us and helped to make my birthday dinner very special .

Cannot wait to return !
We all had a brilliant time."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the quality of sushi here. Everything is fresh as can be including some killer uni and monk fish liver. The black cod was also cooked just right. Good vibe and space with good views of the strip. If you're looking for top notch sushi this place has it covered just that it comes at a premium price. But it is Vegas and someone has to pay for all those lights."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place!  The sushi and sashimi were amazing and the presentation and service were wonderful!  
My husband and I recently went to Sushi Roku on a date while visiting family in the Scottsdale area.  We are quite particular about the flavor and freshness of our sushi, but love to try new places when we get a chance.  We decided to go to Sushi Roku based on a recommendation from a friend who has been there.  We were SO glad we did!  The sushi was so fresh and flavorful and the presentation of the food and the service were just as wonderful. We also loved the atmosphere of the restaurant itself.  We chose to sit outdoors in a booth and the Scottsdale weather and the lighting were just perfect for an evening meal.  
If you love sushi, you should definitely try this place.  We will definitely go back every chance we get."}
{"text":"I would give them 4 stars for service, everything was good nothing spectacular though. It's more for the ambiance  and going with friends or on a date.

One of the managers there were super nice and gave us really good service."}
{"text":"Surprisingly I'm going to give 4 stars to Sushi Roku.

Here's why...

Being that it was my first time to this location I was SUPER skeptical because it sits at the W hotel in old town Scottsdale, which is nice but, it's a restaurant, not some hot Sushi/club scene that came here from LA as people portray it to be. 


So I was smart, I went on a Monday night when I knew the affliction and UFC crowd would be to a minimum and the staff could actually concentrate and relax instead of bustling around rushing because of a shouting, rude clientele. 

Not to my surprise the experience was exceptional, the staff was hands down friendly, confident in the chef and on track with recommendations including a delicious pairing with a bottle of chilled sake. 

I opted for the steak wrapped asparagus to begin and the stimulus menu for a main course.

To those who don't know, the stimulus menu is a 3 course meal served for $30.00 where you can choose either \"Land\" or \"Sea\" and yes, it's okay to mis-match them too. 

I had the \"Land\" as my first course which constitutes 3 of the restaurants most popular items, steak, chicken, etc and all were prepared absolutely to spec, well except maybe my steak was a tad cold but meh, everything was going awesome so far so why screw it up by complaining.

The second course however I had the \"Sea\" version in which 4 different pieces of nigiri are served with 3 different types of roll, also note, you can substitute fish in case you aren't feeling shrimp or whatever they serve you, a total plus. 

Third course is green tea ice cream, always a winner in my book.

To sum it up I'd say this location met my expectations with what I had become accustomed to with the LA locations, I'll be back for sure, just never on a weekend, not in Scottsdale at least."}
{"text":"The happy hour here at Sushi Roku at the W Hotel is good, just make sure you are on time as they are very strict on when it ends. The staff is very nice and checks on you often. You can move next door to the Living Room Lounge area which has a fireplace and nice lobby bar at the W, or go to the rooftop bar later for a club atmosphere.
The Kobe sliders have changed from two smaller ones to a single big one, but remains very tasty. The Tuna Tartare was just okay. The Albacore Sashimi was decent. The Crispy Mahi Mahi Tacos were good, but of course, fried.
The top pick probably is still the Kobe slider and the Mini Chocolate Volcano.
See photos."}
{"text":"So the long awaited W has finally opened its doors and so too has Sushi Roku! 
My \"date\" and I stroll in Monday evening and because it had just opened 3 days earlier I was expecting it to be much more crowded then it was. But that was OK. 
The whole atmosphere of the restaurant was perfect; dark and sexy until they sat us next to the sushi bar where some type of refrigeration unit was running. I could barely even hear the waitress when she came to our table. She did happily seat us at a table further away from what ever that thing was. 
They had a great cocktail list. I had a drink called the fusion which was the perfect blend of berries, watermelon and vodka. It was not overly sweet. They can make a mean dirty Grey goose vodka as well. 
The tofu appetizer was to die for, for those that are tofu fanatics. They make their own tofu in house and serve it with truffles, caviar and green onion. Heavenly! The yellow tail appetizer was also good but you can find the same at alot of other sushi places around town. 
Now for the Sashimi. Their pieces we cut quite a bit larger than most sushi places but also not cut through all the way so you end up with a huge hunk of fish. We did mention it to the waitress. We also thought the sashimi was not the freshest around. We felt like splashing some water on it to bring it to life! Same goes with the ginger, it appeared freeze dried! 
The roll I ordered was one of the best I've had though. It was called something like the Samir. Avocado and spicy tuna rolled in shrimp with rice paper, cilantro and some \"hot sauce\". Yum-E. It melted in my mouth and did not fall apart between my chop sticks! Impressive! 
So overall, I will definitely be visiting this place again. Maybe not for the sashimi but everything else was top par!!"}
{"text":"I would definately agree with some other reviewers that this is an ambience place. At that, it is gorgeous. The food was pretty good but really nothing spectacular. Some interesting technique to put sticky rice on a kabab which gave the rice a nice texture. I saved up my OpenTable rewards points to go here on Valentine's day and ended up feeling guilty when we left. Staff was nice but I am all about the food and this place just didn't cut it for me, especially for the price/hype."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great atmosphere, great service and innovative cocktails.  I really enjoyed this place.

The room has hanging wook panels throughout and is reminiscent of a jungle somewhere far away.  Even the bathrooms are beautiful.  

The sushi is perfect and service was attentive.  I enjoyed my sake cocktail and my friend enjoyed her lycee mojito.

There is a great view of the Strip.  The restaurant closed at 11, but it was a Sunday night.  This might be a 5-star restaurant, but we arrived at closing time and there was a medical incident in the dining room just prior to our arrival."}
{"text":"Everything is overpriced in Las Vegas but sometimes the price - quality difference really astounds you. The prices here are a little too extreme for the quality. The sushi was OK. If I'm going to spend 50-65 dollars on myself for dinner I would expect better service or better food- either one. The sushi seemed rushed oh a rather empty night- I was in not in. hurry as I told them but maybe they just wanted me out of there. 

If they sit in the back you have very good views of the strip but if you are toward the front it kind of looks like it are sitting in a mall restaurant- and a rather low rent one at that. 

I went there because the reviews were very good and there was no line and the menu looks pretty solid. Unfortunately, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Located in Ceasars Palace, in the Forum Shops, near the exit to the Strip, on the top floor.

We came at 4p for their Happy Hour & dinner.  Since we wanted both, we sat at the bar which was great because we wanted to watch basketball.

Happy Hour-
Sunday-Thursday: 4-7p
Friday-Saturday: 4-6p

Nice ambiance, friendly staff, but I wish they were more attentive because everything came out quick except our mochi which came out 20 minutes after we asked for it (& all they had to do was get it from the freezer...), & the food was okay, very pricey but yet very simple.

Spicy Scallop Roll:  Good, simple.
Crunchy Spicy Tuna Tempura:  Very lightly crunchy.  Okay.
Salmon Nigiri:  Fresh.
Katana Roll:  Good.
Strawberry Mochi:  Very old!  The mochi outside crunched into pieces.
Cookies & Cream Mochi:  Good, the mochi on this one was soft."}
{"text":"Located inside Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Sushi Roku did not disappoint. First, our waiter Sherman Fu was exellent! Attentive, great with recommendations and very polite. We started with cocktails - the Sweet Poochi was deliiiicious, followed by an amazing Omakase menu - 6 courses at the chef's discretion, made with the day's freshest fish - all original and timed to arrive just at the right moment as we finished the previous dish. We left there extremely satisfied!"}
{"text":"I was fortunate to grow up on the California coast and have eaten some really incredible sushi. That said, being hundreds of miles away from the Pacific Ocean was not encouraging me to consume sushi in Las Vegas. But, Sushi Roku was a pleasant sushi slap to the face! The Happy Hour was a true hour, 5pm to 6pm, so if you are local and looking to head there at this time... do not underestimate the traffic! We made it with about 15 minutes to spare and were able order our meal, happy hour prices and all!

Said prices were around half off, and hand rolls were cheaper than cut rolls, but are not great for sharing. The rolls were a good size and the fish was good quality. I have found few places that use real crab in their CA rolls and luckily Sushi Roku's were on the money!

My favorite rolls of the night were tuna / avocado, tempura sweet potato, rock shrimp / jalapeño, & spicy scallop  (which I absolutely had to try because it was new & exciting). 

I will be trying more sushi restaurants on the strip. But will also be a reoccurring customer at Sushi Roku for their happy hour! Loved their quiet location in the Forum Shops, hip / cool ambiance, and sushi bar / table / bar-bar options for seating."}
{"text":"I had heard this place was just OK, despite frequenting the W in the last few months. I made my way over on a very busy Saturday night and requested a table for one. The feeling I leave this restaurant with is extremely happy and satisfied as the staff was unparalleled in their welcoming attitude toward me. I think because I was sitting alone, they may have felt sorry for me LOL, not realizing it was quite fantastic. 
The fish was fresh, I ordered the chef's choice sushi eight piece. They were single pieces of fish prepared with ingredients that would accentuate the flavor of the pieces perfectly. 
All of the staff seem to know the menu extremely well and all made similar recommendations which turned out to be epic. The brussel sprouts chips were very decent and light. I will be back. as much for the wonderful staff as much as for the amazing and fresh fare."}
{"text":"Everything we had was absolutely amazing.  After we finished our meals, a businessman sat down next to us at the Sushi Bar.  He began ordering some things that didn't sound familiar from the menu.....turned out he was a regular that had his own routine and they seemed happy to accommodate him.  We followed suit and ordered two pieces of gold truffle yellowtail.....simply put the best piece of sushi I have ever had....I fully expected each piece to run $30 for how elaborate it was but they ended up being $25 for the pair.  Still a pricey single piece of sushi but absolutely worth it.

Service was what you would expect sitting at a sushi bar....the sushi chef's were open to conversation and very polite.  

Price point is on par for being in the Forum Shops at Caesars."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and nosh on a Thursday night and had a great time!

We ordered appetizers off the happy hour menu but skipped the happy hour drinks because it looked boring.  Instead, we ordered a bottle of sake and Hendricks cocktails (gin, lime juice, simple syrup, cucumber).  These are the appetizers that we loved and would order again:  shishito peppers, green beans, spicy tuna rolls, shrimp & jalapeno rolls.  The fillet with asparagus, albacore rolls, popcorn/tempura shrimp were just okay and not worth reordering.

My hands down favorite were the shishito peppers!

Service was impeccable!  I can't remember our server but we were there awhile and had 2 different servers and both were excellent!"}
{"text":"The menu had some really great looking things on it but the actual food didn't deliver.  We had...

1.  Filet wrapped asparagus - some of the lowest quality filet meat (if it really was filet) I have ever had.  So chewy and fatty that I had to spit out several pieces.  Kind of awkward when the server picks up your cloth napkin and a bunch of chewed up meat balls come flying out of it onto the table.

2.  Albacore sushi - tasted very fishy.  That's all I have to say about that.

3.  Eel and avocado roll - eel was fishy and chewy (kind of a mix between and the filet and albacore)...the rice was hard.

4.  Chicken stuffed peppers - extremely salty and oily.

5.  Truffle oil edamame - excellent!

6.  Green tea - excellent!  

The atmosphere is great and it's connected to the W hotel so there is some fun people watching but don't count on good sushi."}
{"text":"?????????????????????food and waiter's service were wonderful,but only the problem was the sushi chef. me and my bf seated in counter. Japanese sushi chef didnt notice I was Japanese, then they started to say bad words about my bf by Japanese.(my bf visited here couple of times, me first time) I know everybody has their emotion and thinking. but at least they should have said it in back yard if they want to say something. I will never recommende to somebody here."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku is the most amazing Japanese high quality restaurant I have been to in Vegas. The 8 years plus I have spent in Las Vegas I haven't been to a better sushi bar. The food although a bit pricey is well worth the investment. Sushi Roku is located in the forum shops located right next to Caesars Palace. This restaurant is located on the third floor which contains a variety of fashion stores to enjoy after your meal.

The appetizer i started with was the lobster Tempura for the price of $35.00. The meat of the lobster came from the the tail very juicy and delicious. The lobster was chopped into nuggets with a sweet and golden miso glaze. The first bite made me think I struck gold with this one. The baked crab hand-roll was my next appetizer and it did not disappoint me. This little morsel was $11.00 classically made with lobster,rice, and butter wrapped in soy paper. This like the lobster tempura had very juicy succulent lobster in it.

Then, I went on to my entree... the best steak ever. The uniquely delicious prime rib-eye steak  \"JAPONAIS\" was a meat lovers dream at the price of $48.00. The steak I chose was medium rare it was very tender and garnished with tomatoes. The sides included Japanese style potatoes in a delicious sauce and mini wedge shaped.Lastly, this dish included garlic green beans and a delicious garlic sauce that would make A1 cry.

Last but not least, the chocolate lava cake that blew my mind. The minute I took my spoon and cut into this chocolate volcano, chocolate flowed out. Their was also a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and a small cookie. The combination of all three would satisfy anyone after a 3 course meal.

The end of my meal included a birthday surprise for one of my family members. The staff brought my aunt a free creme brulee and brought a wine glass with a sparkler. The fireworks show was the fork in the steak and made the meal wrap up splendidly. Definitely a great destination for a birthday or any other sort of get together. 

This is my first post on Yelp! and well I hope you enjoyed it. Lets see where my taste buds take me next...Talk to you soon!"}
{"text":"Sushi Roku is amazing! The food, the view overlooking the strip, and the ambiance was superb. The restaurant manager greets every table and welcomed all guests."}
{"text":"Yummy quality fish and unique flavors. Great view of the strip and great service. We started with the kale salad, but it was the only thing we didn't like. It was strangely salty. We were disappointed that they didn't offer a good deal on a combination plate of sushi or sashimi. We loved the baked lobster roll- it was super rich and indulgent. We also shared the gensai roll- which was fresh and crunchy. We had never tasted such a unique roll. It was okay enough to eat, but I don't think we would order it again. We also had the chicken fried rice, which was yummy. We would go back again."}
{"text":"What a great night! Had our wedding anniversary weekend early in Vegas and Sushi Roku took great care of us!!! Eric was our waiter and he did a great job!! Thanks Eric!!

Our favorite menu items: 
-Tuna Pizza
- Japanese Fried Chicken

..And Roku was so sweet to treat us with the best & most fun dessert, like, EVER:
S'MORES!!!!

Thank you for making our Anniversary dinner so special!"}
{"text":"Wow - this may go down as my least favorite meal in Las Vegas, ever.  While the decor is a very chic contemporary japanese and quite pleasing, there are huge windows all around that turn this place into a sauna - even in January, when the outside temp is 60, it was borderline unpleasant while dining - can't imagine how it feels when the sun is really on.  Onto the food: I ordered 3 things from the menu - I sent 2 of them back - when I received my last 2 plates the fish inside was cooked, and this wasn't the description on the menu.  The only reason I didn't send all 3 back was because the first item I got, Hamachi sashimi - was \"ok\" taste wise, and since it was the first dish - I was hoping things would get better from there.  Yes - when I goto a sushi place, I expect raw fish.  Anyhow - the server didn't blink when I told him of my displeasure with the dishes, and the check was settled without any obvious display of annoyance.  I will say that this was a far cry from my experiences at Sushi Roku in LA, which were delicious."}
{"text":"We were  here for lunch during our engagement weekend and loved this place! 

Appetizer = Edamame Hummus
*nothing special, just yummy hummus with plenty of chips for it

Beef with Sushi Lunch Plate
*The MOST AMAZING beef ever. We asked our server what kind of meat it was and she said \"filet tip\". We are still thinking and raving about this beef when we order beef at other places.

Teriyaki Chicken with Tempura Lunch Plate
*chicken was seasoned very well. Tempura was perfectly battered

Fiance had scaallop sushi and a few others and said they were fresh and tasted great!

Service
*VERY attentive, not sure if it was because it was lunch time but it was great. 

As said by others, the view was amazing and we loved it even more when we realized we were eating right above our Trevi Fountain engagement site :) 

Priced a little high but worth it totally for us!

We will 100% be back here whenever we are in Vegas again!

Thanks Sushi Roku, you Rock hehe!"}
{"text":"Sushi Roku was spectacular with their food and service! I mean, sure I don't eat sushi often and had a crazy strong hankering for some while scoping out the casino but that doesn't mean I'm biased! Proof? Very well eager Yelper.

First, the service. The ladies poised at the podium up front were all smiles and will be very quick to guide you to your seat. The lady at the bar was pleasant and helpful in her suggestions of what dishes were most popular (as well as her personal favorites).

Next, le food. Oh lawd. Each dish was elegantly plated, the food on the plates were excellent in quality and taste. I don't know how to put into words how happy the food made me. Turn to the pictures for a deeper understanding of what these morsels look like.

Finally, decor. VERY cool stuff. From the layout of the restaurant and seating, to the art on the bathroom - Sushi Roku made the food, the view, and the experience very much worth it! I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Unimpressed. 

Our dishes got progressively worse as the meal went on.

The decor here is the highlight. Super-cool ambiance.

Otherwise, the food was a very poor value, even by Vegas standards.

I loved the Yellowtail Sashimi with diced Chilies. Very yummy!

We had 2 Tempura rolls and both tasted like a camp fire. Not sure if the oil in the deep fryer was burnt? But it was foul. Also, experience some severe fishy-ness in the couple of Tuna rolls we tried. 

I could find better fish at a run-of-the-mill strip mall sushi restaurant. Too many great restaurants to bother with this one."}
{"text":"I needed a little snack to tide me over until an evening event at Caesar's Palace, so I stopped in for a quick graze at the sushi bar.  I ordered a couple pieces of tuna and salmon sushi, as well as a spicy tuna hand roll, which I use as a measure of any sushi restaurant I visit.  Both were excellent, but the hand roll was a real surprise.

Many times I have had a hand roll that was acceptable, but this restaurant went the extra step to crisp the nori before wrapping the spicy tuna.  The result is an extraordinary crunch of the seaweed before biting into the perfectly seasoned tuna.  

Excellent atmosphere and great staff coupled with the food made me want to bail on my appointment and stay for a major feed.  Next year I plan to do just that!"}
{"text":"Dimly lit, with hip, global influenced urban interior, Sushi Roku is sleekly packaged. 
Fortunately, the food is on par with its decor.
Everything we tried (beef tataki, kurobata pork, chilean sea bass, and lobster roll) was fresh and well cooked. The flavors was creative without trying too much. It was fusion while still retaining basic essence of good, clean Japanese flavors.The only complaint was the over peppering of the tuna steak.
A very pleasant dining experience if one ever needs a break from buffet overload."}
{"text":"Searched for a sushi restaurant that opened before 5pm and Sushi Roku came up. I was happy to see that there was a number of things for non meat eaters on the menu:) The food was awesome, the drinks were refreshing and the service was amazing!!! Thank you to our waiter Rommie! He was so helpful.. He recommended the perfect items and drinks and was super friendly and even gave us dessert!!! Thank you again Rommie!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a chic, elegant and youthful evening out then this can go into the suggestion barrel.   The W is like a modern movie set with lots of beautiful people running around.  Our waiter was a bloke from Brooklyn and he was fantastic--knowledgeable, charming and efficient.

The food really was delicious.  My wife had a plate of grilled vegetables that were excellent and my steak could not have been better.  Our daughters had noodles and sushi and, again, delicious.

Okay for you Japanese purists out there.  We sat next to a group of 4 Japanese adults who didn't have enough English to get through Run Jane Run.  As they left, I obnoxiously tapped one on the shoulder to ask what he thought of the restaurant's Japanese food and he articulately stated, \"Not Japanese food\".  Oh well, I enjoyed my American meal."}
{"text":"Such a romantic sushi spot! But my girlfriends and I enjoyed it sans men-folk .Great view of the strip and comfy/cozy leather lounge seating. 
Service was great and always with a smile. Wait, you mean my server is NOT annoyed that i'm here and ordering? nice!

Everything tasted delicious and most importantly fresh. Overall most things are reasonably priced but you will pay a bit more for specialty items. But honestly the food in some of the food courts in Vegas can get pretty pricey so I say you might as well get what you really want."}
{"text":"Happy hour! :) For food and drinks, but I only had water here. The water itself was deng sexy. LOL. Lemon placed in the cup with a toothpick, you wouldn't feel like it's just water.

The happy hour items had was:
 - Filet Mignon Wrapped Asparagus w/Soy Mirin: It was good! The sauce and juice from the meat thinly wrapped around 4 stalks (two halved asparagus) was delicious. The asparagus was cooked, but still had it's crunch in the center. (HH: $6)
 - A2 Fusion: consists of albacore, onion, avocado & jalapeno. One of the best rolls I've had in a while. (HH: $5)

You'd get more with sushi roll, $4 handroll isn't worth the quantity.

Decor was simple, had a hint of modern, and even thought it's in Vegas, felt like I was in California, if that makes any sense. LOL

For Happy Hour, you'd have to sit in a designated spot. Only minus 1 star, because I had to sit with people who were trash talking about Asians at the same table. It's not their fault, but I wasn't able to move from the table to another spot to avoid hearing them continuously bash on my culture. Made my eating a bit awkward."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi place ever. I absolutely love love it.  I honestly would love to see where some of the haters on here have had better sushi! Its my fav and I come here every time I come to Vegas"}
{"text":"Had a business meal here and all i can say is WOW. Loved it. Great service and very good food. If you like Sushi then this is a must.

Visited July 201"}
{"text":"absolutely love this restaurant......service, quality of the food, origionality of the dishes is superbe"}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch. The sushi is average for the price. The crunchy spicy tuna avocado roll was yummy. I'd recommend this place for lunch, but certainly don't head here for dinner. It's in the middle of Caesars Mall smacked in between a bunch of stores."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on food because I ordered this for take-out. My lunch consisted of:

Baked Lobster Rolls
Scallop & Salmon Nigiri
Spicy Scallop Hand roll
Filet Foie Gras Skewer

First Impression, Fish pieces for the nigiri was relatively smaller than other a la carte places. Foie Gras Skewer, I was expecting a bit more for the price of $18. It was literally just 1 skewer. With super thin slices of Foie Gras between meat and asparagus. 

For the taste, the salmon, I couldn't tell too much how fresh the fish was. It had a little bit of aftertaste, a bit fishier than normal, although did not have a freezer burn taste, so I can't tell. The scallop tasted fresh though. 

Spicy Scallop Hand Roll, might be too spicy for some people, but I like my food SPICY. So I enjoyed the taste, but the texture was just too mushy.

The Foie Gras Skewer - biggest let down of my whole order. There was literally not any noticeable foie gras on this. I was expecting more. You can't even taste it. The beef filet was dry. Bleh. 

The only thing I semi-enjoyed was the baked lobster rolls. Chunk of lobster in each bite. But even so, still mediocre at best. Sushi Roku didn't really do it for me. It definitely did not live to its hype. Overpriced, and mediocre."}
{"text":"I n my humble opinion this is one of the best, if not the best Japanese Restaurants on the Strip. Excellent service, amazing salmon carpaccio, beef wrapped asparagus, wagyu beef, very good rolls and alcohol selection. Very helpful and considerate staff."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with some girlfriends on Saturday night. It has a nice clean and trendy atmosphere with some tasty bites. It's a little pricey, as are most decent sushi restaurants. Their cocktails are yummy, I had a refreshing St. Germaine, as well as some miso soup and veggie tempura (not a fish person, ew).

Good place for girls night, or dates. If you're a resident of Scottsdale, they even feature a \"locals discount\" certain times during the summer.. Thumbs up to management!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is all about.  Maybe because it's sushi on the strip?  There's better sushi and it's outside the strip.  

Ok, I'm not saying it's bad.  The calamari was good and different from the calamari I'm used to.  The jalapeno glaze gave it a tangy crunchy flavor, which makes it unique.  We ordered 2 rounds of that.  

The endamame, I was expecting to have more spices added on to it.  There was barely any salt.  

Got the foie gras skewer as an appetizer.  It was just a small skewer wrapped in asparagus.  Tasty, but for the price, I wish I got more than a skewer.  It was so tiny.  

I also had the pork belly fried rice with fried egg on top.  I like the flavor of the pork belly and how tender it was.  Runny fried egg made it all better.

This place is good, but pricey since on the strip.  Ambiance was good too.  You need to make a reservation to get strip view seating."}
{"text":"I have died and gone to sushi heaven!  The irony is I happened to eat sushi earlier today at a different restaurant, and Sushi Roku's same dish, just blew the other place's right out of the water!  OMG!  

Add excellent food (the prices were definitely a bit higher than other sushi places- but still the flavor and quality were tangible things you can actually TASTE), excellent service (Angela was a complete doll!- and the GM Seth rocks!), and fresh and fab decor, and you have a winner!

Mark my words, this will be THE place to be seen for quite some time to come.  

On a side note, I also liked the trendy-ness (and yet very approachable and friendly nature) of the hotel in general.  Everyone was super cool and welcoming to my friend and I.....although it doesn't hurt that she is smokin' hot and we are both super friendly and nice!  But it did appear that EVERYONE was greeted and served graciously.

The fillet appetizer (wrapped around asparagus) was divine!  The spicy tuna rolls literally melt in your mouth, and the soft crab rolls are a little slice of heaven.  

Be sure to look your best and have fun people watching while enjoying a great meal!  (But save up, 'cause it ain't cheep!)  BTW, we went on a Thurs, and it was pretty packed.  MAKE RESERVATIONS!!

Warmest wishes,

Kirin :)"}
{"text":"Because I was here on someone else's dime, I enjoyed the food very much.  I had the pork ramen and the salmon carpaccio.  Living in Austin, ramen is like rain, very, very scarce.  Out of the ramen I've had across the US, this was solid.  Nothing to obsess over, but FAR from the worst I've had.  The salmon carpaccio had wonderful olive oil, mint, and light seasoning that I loveeeeeeee.

$7 for a 12oz Sapporo?  Well, this is Vegas.  Find this place in the corner of the Forum shops on the highest level."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place despite having heard some positive things from my husband's friend.  We sat at the bar as we were not planning on eating an excessive meal and we were just looking to be a tad more low key than what I had seen in the dining room.  

I was not impressed with the quality of the fish, or the service here.  Decent, no complaints about the food, but it was just like what I could get back home (which is not all that impressive)."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always go for happy hour which includes cheap drinks and eats. The bar tender is always very friendly and fun to talk with. Sushi is fresh!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm, Mmmmmm, Great food.  The popcorn shrimp here are to die for-they leave a wonderful lasting impression.  So does their desert plate...The service was wonderful and quick and attending to us.  Also, we had been lounging at the pool all day and were not looking so sharp but they didn't seem to have a dress code or anything as they were more than welcoming.  It is a bit pricey but i'm not sure you can expect anything less when going to a W Hotel.  I recommend this place to anyone who wants a more chic sushi experience, cool atmosphere, doesn't mind paying the extra dollar and enjoys tasty food."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.  I come here not for \"Authentic\" Japanese food, but for fresh seafood and great drinks served in a very fun environment.

I usually go for several assorted sashimi/appetizer dishes, followed by a couple hot entrees.  The lobster tempura is excellent, as is the hirame sashimi, prepared with citrus and jalepeno.  Service is just as good as the food, as the waitstaff is very attentive yet not overbearing."}
{"text":"Tasty, unique rolls. My fav sushi in vegas so far.

love the location- in the forum shops... overlooking the strip.

Fresh fish and they do something different than K-RAB!!! thank goodness!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi--and great atmoshere. My friend told me this is a chain store in LA, but the quality was great. WAY overpriced, but that's okay on the corporate expense account---LOVE corporate! I showed them some magic and the management was very sweet and friendly and open and nice. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for sushi we stopped at Sushi Way. We had the all you can eat for dinner 26.95 Bacon wrapped scallops are awesome coconut shrimp tempura was awesome every thing we had was awesome many things to order off all you can eat menu. The chef was great he helped us order and surprised us with different rolls. A great experience I had never had all you can eat sushi and was nervous but for no reason it was awesome."}
{"text":"Blown away by this restaurant! I've been looking for a good place for sushi in the valley for a while.. and I have been extremely disappointed at every turn. Out here it is almost never real, authentic Japanese sushi. I kid you not, it's hard to find one that doesn't put hot sauce on their spicy tuna.. it's frightening actually. Well, I stumbled on this place on a Saturday afternoon. My boyfriend and I were extremely underdressed, as the place looks really upscale. We almost turned around and left because of that, but I'm SOOO glad we didn't. The service was amazing. Very knowledgeable, fun waiters. The place is gorgeous. My cocktail was top-notch. But the SUSHI... OH MY GOD. It was AMAZING. The best sushi I think I've ever had even outside of Arizona. Extremely fresh. Made to perfection. Melt in your mouth, delicious, truly authentic sushi. We will DEFINITELY be back.. and definitely not in our sweats this time."}
{"text":"I was recommended to try Sushi Roku located in the Forum Shops and I'm glad I did.  
The restaurant itself is nicely decorated.  I liked the decor that's on the restrooms doors.
(See photo) 

Service: 
From the time I walked in to leaving the restaurant I felt like I was special. 
I was warmly greeted by a young lady in which I mentioned that I would be dining alone and would like a view of the strip.  DONE! She sat me right along the windows that overlooked the south side of the strip.  
Hugo, my server, was very helpful in recommending a sushi of my liking. He kept coming around to make sure that I liked my dish and we got to chit chat a little about the food.   (I don't eat raw fish often but in this case I figure I'd try it and see if it was fresh)

I'm glad I did. My sushi was topped with Tuna that was yummy and fresh. I also informed him that I don't like too much jalapeno's  so he made sure it was on the side rather than wrapped in my sushi.  The miso soup was tasty and very flavorful and I washed it down with a Blue Moon.  ( I know I should've had a Sapporo instead) 

My experience here was amazing that whenever I'm in Vegas I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Second time I was there to entertain business guests. Excellent service and great view of the strip. Tasty food, though a bit pricey. Of course, that's expected in Vegas nowadays."}
{"text":"Not accommodating at all. I'm a vegetarian and asked the server to see if the sushi chef can make some vegetarian rolls for me. They made a cucumber roll with cucumber and asparagus, which is fine. However, the roll is very small and asked if they can make another roll. The server asked and told me that the sushi chefs can't make anything else. So they are telling me that the sushi chefs can't make any other vegetarian rolls besides a cucumber and asparagus roll? That's a bit ridiculous considering this is an upscale place. Kabuki, a typical Japanese restaurant, made me so much different vegetarian rolls when I asked. Disappointed!

Great atmosphere though."}
{"text":"We went to happy hour and had almost everything on the menu. One of the best happy hours I have been to. Highly recommend the shrimp tempura, rolls, Brussel sprouts in bacon."}
{"text":"2.5 stars

Loud and crowded restaurant with over-priced sushi and misc. Japanese food items.

Ordered the miso soup ($5) and the BBQ chicken ($14). 40 minutes later, our food arrived. Long wait much?

The chicken were 4 pieces. Seriously?! Come on, dude. 4 pieces for $14? Don't cheap out on me. Ugh, I was still ravenous after my meal.

The miso and chicken pieces were good. But wished the portions were a tad bit more.

My girlfriend ordered the $14 ramen which was price-worthy. 

Despite our longer than average wait, our group was charged 20% gratuity. We protested, they returned the money. Seriously lame.

Not a fan of this place. Will not return; there are better places to eat on the strip."}
{"text":"All the steak dishes are absolutely amazing! So is their chicken fried rice. I come back everytime i come to vegas and will go again!"}

Pretty cool place to hangout if I wanted to be seen with cool crowd I guess (my mom said I was cool....) I didn't think their sushi and rolls were to too exciting. I guess they had to please the crowd and what's hip and cool.  The only thing exotic is parked outside, not on the menu.  Pretty basic and mediocre at best. Nothing I haven't seen. 

Service was good overall and attentive.  Ambience is like a lounge and smooth.  I felt like I back in Hollywood Blvd hanging at Katana's. - Enjoy"}
{"text":"There was this superstar basketball player at  my high school: he was tall, rich, handsome, got the ladies, and was very talented in comparison to the rest of the high school population.  All of those aforementioned things caused people to hate him, no, loathe his very essence, so every time he got the ball, the opposing team would yell, \"Overrated!\"

Some people would say that Sushi Roku is overrated, but I say those people are jealous losers who are sad they can't eat here everyday.

This place is soooo good, and I will not comment on the price because I never saw the bill (thank you to my employer).  But I will tell you about the fanciful meal I experienced.  We started with the BEST DISH I had there: the lobster tempura in a miso soy glaze.  Lobster, check.  Fried, check.  Tempura, check.  Yummy sauce, check.  It's like a Chicken McNugget on steroids!  

After that, I was afraid the other dishes wouldn't hold up, but they did.  Some sushi/rolls to try (I can't eat fish, only shellfish...don't judge me!): crab dynamite, hotate (so sweet, so buttery!), amaebi (yes, i like to eat the crunchy heads), and the baked crab.

P.S. Note on high school basketball star: he plays basketball for some other country because he didn't make it into the NBA, and there is a hilarious video on youtube with him trying to dunk and instead falling and banging his head on the ground.  He's okay so you're not going to hell if you laugh."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this place, I ordered salmon sashimi (the best that I've tasted) a few other rolls and my boyfriend ordered the Uni which he swears by...it is good quality fish and the views of the strip are awesome!"}
{"text":"Good food and awesome Sunday night deal with the half off wine bottle! Thanks CJ for being a great server!"}
{"text":"Yeah yeah yeahhhh...it's another chain sushi place.  I know.  But I really think it deserves five stars from me because we had such a great experience here!  When I go to restaurants in Vegas, I admit that I typically don't expect much from the wait staff.  There's usually some type of \"air\" about them as if they're above everybody else because they work at a restaurant on the Vegas Strip.  My visit to Sushi Roku pleasantly surprised me.  Our server, whose name I unfortunately forget (I blame Vegas brain, hard to remember), was amazing.  He recommended a Saki that was delicious, and he even offered us tastings of sashimi and another type of Saki on the house!  He truly went above and beyond what I would expect from a dining experience in Vegas, let alone anywhere else.  Also, the view in this restaurant is pretty nice if you sit in the room with all the glass windows.  One of my friends was in Vegas for his first time, and he was able to enjoy a nice view down the strip from our table."}
{"text":"We happened to have dinner here 2 nights in a row. The ambiance is young, vibrant, cool, and \"clubby,\" not by chance, as Sushi Roku is part of the W Scottsdale and is adjacent to the hotel's trendy night spot. The food was consistently better than average: both nights the waiters suggested their version of chicken tenders as a house specialty, and both nights we weren't sure why. Some items were pretty good, like the sea bass and the spicy edamame. The wait staff was attentive and friendly. It was pretty good; I would just warn any serious foodies that they may be a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for Arizona Restaurant Week although I'd been here once before. The tasting menu was a GREAT opportunity to sample their sushi offerings as well as some of their other entrees.

I'm still a bit of a sushi virgin and while I thoroughly enjoyed everything, my more seasoned sushi-eaters said that they had had better. They offered a braised pork belly that was fantastic and as one who does not like miso soup AT ALL, I LOVED the miso that was served at Sushi Roku.

We were puzzled that the sake we ordered was served cold as we're used to warm sake, Our server, who was awesome (and a ginger I might add) explained that warming of sake is usually done to make the lower quality sakes more flavorful.....not too sure about that. So all in all the sake was not the best we'd had but we made the most of it.

The atmosphere is cool and the service is great. I would recommend it to anyone and there are some great dishes for any sushi-haters to enjoy."}
{"text":"If I could give this 3.5 stars I would. The food is a solid 3 - really nothing special, especially considering the price. It's not bad, but it doesn't stand out. The ambiance is a 4. the place is beautiful."}
{"text":"Was in town for a girls weekend, staying in the W Hotel. This place was perfect for a late dinner on night one when everyone was flying in and just wanted to stay close. I wish I took more pictures of the actual food but it was all so delicious we gobbled it up asap. 

Appetizers - Premium edamame, Brussels sprouts chips, Beef rib eye wrapped asparagus, Hokkaido Scallop Sashimi

Entrees - tons of sashimi pieces, plus rolls: Crunchy spicy tuna, Shima, Katana, Tuna Jalapeno (my favorite!), Spicy Scallop.

Dessert - Smores and Chocolate Lava cake

All of it came out quick and really tasty. The wait staff was really great and made awesome recommendations (the hostesses weren't the warmest but I'll chalk that up to a slammed waiting area and Brody Jenner and some guy from the Jersey Shore being there!)."}
{"text":"Took my wife out for our 10th anniversary.  The sushi was great!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! My husband and I dined here for my birthday this past weekend and although I was at first let down by not getting a view seat due to a private party, the food more than made up for it! 

We started with the Yellowtail Sashimi with Chilies appetizer which was recommended to us by our waiter after attempting to order the Crudo Roku sashimi tasting. He said it was much better, and it was actually a few bucks less so we took his advice and loved it! The chilies added a great flavor to the Yellowtail and the presentation was great. 

We then moved on to the Shima Roll and the Albacore with Scallions cut roll. That Shima Roll...OMG...pure heaven!! I'm pretty sure it is the best roll I've ever had!! The combination of textures and flavors was pure perfection.  The avocado was so soft and ripe, the tuna was buttery and wonderful, and the cilantro and little dab of hot sauce added just the right amount of zing. The Albacore was also wonderful as were the subsequent items we ordered, the Live Halibut sushi and the Toro & Jalapeno Roll.

We enjoyed a carafe of sake during our meal and indulged in a few sake bombs before I finished with their wonderful Lychee Martini. I was then surprised with an awesome chocolate souffle birthday dessert! I was so stuffed already but managed to polish it off! 

The service was great as our waiter was very attentive and friendly. Though the prices are indeed a bit high, I felt it was worth it for the wonderful food, ambiance and service. We look forward to coming back to Sushi Roku the next time we're in Vegas and will also make it a point to try out the other locations in LA next time we're up that way! We've dined at their Katana Restaurant in Hollywood (see review) and loved it equally as well!"}
{"text":"Anytime I am in Arizona I visit Sushi Roku it is a must for me. I love how friendly the staff is but most importantly LOVE Dan the GM, congrats on the promotion Dan you more then deserve it! Today I visited Sushi Roku Scottsdale looking forward to the food, friendly staff and of course seeing my favorite person Dan who sadly wasn't there at the time but still myself and company enjoyed ourselves. The food was amazing as always and Sarah our server was phenomenal, she is so genuine just all around an asset to the company, I also had the pleasure of meeting the manager on duty Steve he was also great and very sweet! Steve had heard about my horrendous Experience at the Sushi Roku in LA ( Santa Monica) as that is where I reside and took care of our dessert as he felt horrible knowing what my experience was like at the Santa Monica Location. I was thrilled to know there was one in my area, I talked so highly of Sushi Roku Scottsdale to friends of mine and told them there was one in Santa Monica and decided to show them what all the hype was about, only to walk out embarrassed as the Santa Monica location was just terrible the service was awful and the food was less then mediocre the menu also wasn't completely the same, they didn't have the miso glaze popcorn shrimp tempura ( which Dan got me hooked on it's seriously amazing) and they didn't have crème brûlée. So all in all I have come to the conclusion that if i want Sushi Roku with high end level of service, amazing food and phenomenal staff I guess I have to drive 4 hours to get it! Sorry I missed you Dan but your staff most definitely kept it consistent even with you not there major kudos! Until next time! -Ashley"}
{"text":"This is a very belated review as we were there in May of 2015. I meant to write a review immediately and got lazy. I had researched with the help of yelp to find good places to eat while in Vegas with my hubby. I worked in a sushi bar run by a very meticulous Japanese sushi master, with amazing standards, for 10 years, so I am quite particular in regard to sushi and Japanese cuisine. I saw that Roku had a great happy hour deal. We went and you sit in the bar area. There were tables but we sat right at the bar. The bartender, Tyson, and a waitress, I think her name was Emily, and a runner, who was super knowledgeable about all the dishes she served us. We had the Garden Salad, the Rib Eye Wrapped Asparagus (not me, as I do not eat beef or pork), the Mushroom Tempura with Creamy Truffle Miso, TWO orders of Tuna Tataki, Albacore Tataki and also the Spicy Tuna and Cucumber  Avocado rolls. I had sake and my hubby had a big tall bottle of mineral water, some brand from France. All of these dishes cost from $3-7. Tyson was very nice and personable and gave great recommendations, as well as giving us some personal background, which was interesting, and background about the restaurant owners and the professionalism and authenticity of the chefs. After a very decadent meal and drinks, our bill was $60, and with tip under $100. Definitely a great deal on the strip in Las Vegas! Not only that, but it was one of those meals that leaves you craving to go back to experience those flavors again. I would go back to Vegas just for a Roku!"}
{"text":"It's a beautiful restaurant with a great view looking over Vegas.  The food is great and you definitely pay for it.  Its a cool, trendy scene with \"cool\" trendy people.  Great sushi."}
{"text":"Expensive, tasteless Japanese food.  There was no flavor in teriyaki salmon, tempura, and California roll. Price was expensive, but I do not expect any less from Vegas."}
{"text":"The food is simply perfect. Come for happy hour to try many items at a discount. The steak wrapped asparagus is amazing."}
{"text":"Went to Sushi Roku for dinner last week with some friends and family, I frequent this place often for lunch when I'm in town.  This was the first time I've actually been there for dinner.  

Our dining consisted of the following items:

Appetizers (compliments of the host):

Filet Mignon Asparagus w/Soy Mirin Sauce 16
This was ok, didn't leave a lasting impression on me.

Japanese Yellow Tail Sashimi w/diced chilies 17
The Yellow Tail is a must have.  The fish was fresh and melts in your mouth. 

KaraAge with Cilantro Mayo 12
The chicken was prepared just right and with the cilantro mayo, it was quite yummy.

Rolls:
Shima Roll: Shrimp wrapped Spicy Tuna w/Cilantro & Avocado 18
This roll was quite heavenly.

Entrees:
Grilled Fillet Mignon w/homemade Terriyaki Sauce and Mashed Potatos 36
The fillet mignon was tender and cooked to perfection.  

Chilean SeaBass w/Truffle Miso Glazed and Sauteed Spinach 28
The seabass was pure perfection, cooked medium w/the truffle miso glaze... My mouth waters just thinking about it..

Sauteed Salmon & Hokkaido Scallops; XO sauce with Asparagus & Potatoes 26

The presentation of this entrée was pretty cool.  The fish and scallops were cooked just right.

Desserts:
The Chocolate Volcano Souffle was quite delectable.  

I was surprised with a some sort of Fruit Cup Birthday dessert which had blackberries, carmelized bananas, strawberries, and raspberries.  

The ambiance and décor is quite appealing.
As always the service is impeccable.  I would like to thank Kenji for being such a wonderful host and great dining experience."}
{"text":"Had a group dining here on Sunday night. It wasn't busy at all so they were able to accommodate a large group.  Atmosphere is dark and not too loud. There is a bar area as well. 
It was hard for me to find the restaurant because I entered at the Ceasar's Palace entrance and had to walk like 8-10mins to this restaurant was.
So if you are coming here via taxi/cab, make sure they drop you at the entrance closest to the restaurant itself.

To the Menu-
They have a nice variety of food here. Some people ordered sushi but if that doesn't tickle your fancy no worries.

Tasty items I particularly remembered-
Eggplant Dengaku (So yummy)
Edamame
Roasted Cauliflower
Steamed Shrimp Dumplings


There were a variety of sushi items ordered which I did not taste but everybody enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"Better the second time around. First time in March second time this past weekend. Ask for Paul if you're there on Sunday morning or afternoon. He's helped us out both times and hes one hell of a guy. Just tell him Carlos and Luis (the regulars from L.A.) recommended the place. As good as this place is Uni is disgusting...dont believe me? Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and great views of The Strip. I'd highly recommend the Makoto Roll; although the crunchy Salmon and Crab rolls were tasty as well. Lots of choices."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. The shishito peppers, tofu, and crab and uni tartare were really good. The Titan roll was just ok but all nigiri were really good. I'm glad my friend got the local discount because it was a very expensive dinner! That said, the sushi was excellent.  I was a bit apprehensive because the pictures on yelp didn't look that appealing but I'm happy I came here."}
{"text":"My son was in the mood for sushi, came to yelp and decided on sushi Roku. The place is nice it did not have a wait time in which we found convinient due to the fact that we where starving :). Let me just say this place is average in my opinion and this was the smallest and most EXPENSIVE roll i have ever purchased lol . The place was average ive had better, i would not come back and i would probably not recomend this place. P.S waiters where nice and attentive so was the lady who seated us."}
{"text":"Crystal is absolutely marvelous and charming. The happy hour specials were great too. Definitely coming back! **Birdman hand rub**"}
{"text":"We came here for my cousin's birthday. It was a good experience. 

The atmosphere and décor was exceptional, very trendy and posh. The view of the strip was gorgeous! The service from our wait staff was impeccable and they made sure that we had a great experience. 

We had ordered the following dishes, of course I had to try a little of everyone's dishes.. with some exceptions... hee hee..: 

Japanese Yellowtail Sashimi with diced Chilies: Yummy!! The yellowtail just melted in your mouth. 
Chilean Seabass with Truffle Miso Glaze & Sauteed Spinach: This was my dish...it was seared just right and the truffle miso glaze was so delicious!! I would definitely order this again. 
Sauteed Salmon & Hokkaido Scallops; XO sauce with Asparagus & Potatoes: Scallops were cooked perfectly, not chewy or tough. 
Katana Roll: Tuna & Yellowtail atop Spicy Tuna & Shrimp Tempura: Great presentation, and the fish was really fresh 
Spicy Tuna Hand roll: I wasn't able to try this as it was only for one person. 
Grilled Ji-Dori Chicken with Sauteed Mix Mushrooms & Mashed Potatoes: Chicken was extremely tender, great combination with the sauces. 

This restaurant is a little pricey but c'mon it's Vegas. The ambiance, the delicious food, and the service is definitely well worth it."}
{"text":"I will say this, the sushi, once you finally get it is amazing so the two stars is for the sushi only. That is about all the nice things I have to say. 

I was here with a very large party for a friend's birthday. She warned them (and I do mean warned them) in advanced that it was going to be a large party so you would think that we would have maybe 3 or 4 servers for a party of 40. (not kidding on that number either) So the two servers we had were ok. I would usually name them by name, but alas I won't on this occasion because the service wasn't the best. I am not blaming the servers as they not only had our party of 40 but other tables as well. 

Anywho, my gripe is this. For a busy Saturday night, you would think that they would have enough people to handle all of the people that were at this restaurant. The bar was super slow, the sushi bar was well slow. Let's just say everyone else in our party of 40 were almost finished with their sushi by the time myself and another young lady finally got ours. Yes again , it was good, but wow, it took a very long time. We only had three rolls between the two of us. 

So don't got with a party larger than 6 max! I watched other tables with smaller parties get their food and drinks at record speed so size does matter in this situation. If you go, go early before it gets too busy so that you won't wait for your food or your drinks. Oh and it is a little pricey so be warned. I have no problem paying for good food, as long as the service is just as good. Catch my drift?"}
{"text":"Where should I start. Our server mentioned about flavor, everything was to perfect full of flavor. Spicy edamame was perfect. Nobu specialty shrimp was out of this world. It was absolute great experience. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Food was tasty but not outstanding. You're paying for the upscale and  trendy atmosphere (though I wouldn't expect any less from the W hotel). 

Fellow yelper Dorothy C. and I came here for the lunch specials. 
We shared the sashimi salad which came with 6 pieces of sashimi, iceberg lettuce, and ginger dressing and also split the bento box with miso cod and veggie tempura. Servers are very attentive."}
{"text":"I went here for their happy hour, which really cannot be beat for good sushi on the strip. House Chardonnay was $5 and was very smooth & drinkable. $4 hand rolls: the spicy tuna was just okay, but the AB4 fusion was the bomb.com. I'd also order the popcorn shrimp with miso glaze again ($6). You have to sit at the cocktail bar to get the HH specials which was no problem, besides the 10 bar stools there is a separate long table with maybe 15 seats that also counts as the HH area. Staff was great and the place was pretty empty, so service was super fast."}
{"text":"I feel more 50/50 about our experience here but we walked away feeling positive so I gave it 4 stars. We had dinner reservations after the Celine Dion show and they sat us 20 minutes early which was great. Our table had a beautiful view down the strip but we found the atmosphere to be very rowdy. I know that's Vegas but geez I wish there was such a thing as a classy drunk.

We weren't sure how hungry we were so we shared california rolls, spicy tuna rolls, and a baked lobster roll (which was expensive but very different!). The signature drinks were also some of the best we've ever had anywhere (try the Tokyo Cooler!). Because it was after 10 PM the place wasn't packed so I would've liked a little more attention from our waitor, especially because we like ordering sushi on an as we go basis so we don't over order. Overall the food and drinks were great, but maybe I'd come here at an earlier hour for a different crowd and experience."}
{"text":"This is a great way to start a night in Vegas. Sushi Roku was amazing and such a great place to begin our night. The sushi and drinks were delicious! The staff very helpful and nice and the ambiance great! I highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour menu. The service at the bar was actually great and it didn't really feel like \"bar food or service\".... the bartender made sure to clear our plates fast, kept our drinks refilled, and engaged in conversation. Food was fast yet very tasteful and satisfying. Wanted dessert but didn't have any room left to eat lol. Definitely try the glazed shrimp, SIMPLY AMAZING! I ordered 2 servings!!! Will definitely return on my next Vegas trip!!"}
{"text":"Love me some Sushi Roku in all locations (there's a few of them).  This review is about Las Vegas.  Food is always delicious. Pretty much same menu across locations. The menu is unique (gourmet?) and a bit limited. They do not create substitutes. (in other words, if it ain't on the menu, you can't have it)   Definitely make a reservation for this one because it's hard to get into to after 6pm.  And ask for a strip view (table by the window) if you're on a date. ;) 

The staff is always on the ball and pretty quick - even with a large group.  Like it's sister restaurants, the seating is somewhat 'tight' (if you're a big dude or gal, caution the seating set-up: not just distance between tables, but also distance from your lap to table top in some areas)  

As far as location - it's on the end of the Forum Shops inside Cesar's (strip side) Take the windy escalator all the way to the top.   When i stay on that end of the strip, i like the convenience of walking to Caesars and slipping in the side door. (I call it the \"sneaky door\" -- right after (or before) Mirage.) Thus avoiding the casino completely and that loooonnnnggg walk through the length of the Forum shops.

We are repeat offenders when we're in Vegas. We often bring guests or business associates (when there for convention) because we know we can rely on the food quality, atmosphere and  service every time."}
{"text":"Can't wait to visit this place again. I was in town for my bachelorette party and we were running late for our reservation! The front desk was very understanding when we called, and we didn't feel a single bit rushed when we finally arrived and sat down. Our waiter (so sorry I can't remember your name!) was really helpful in deciding how much of what to order and surprised me with a complimentary dessert. Yum!"}
{"text":"Food was ok nothing spectacular for the price. The Vegas roll was not on the menu but the chef made it for us. I do admit that was nice and it was a good roll. The specialty drinks were good as well. We were here for a friends bday and this is when it went downhill. It took 15 minutes to receive our drinks, it took so long we would order our second round before even finishing our first. Our server rarely came around and was not very educated. Sadly I am giving them two stars not for the food but for the service we received. With paying that much for a meal/drinks I expect much more then what sushi roku provided. I do not think I will be back."}
{"text":"A friend of mine RAVED about this place. Always going on and on about how they fly the fish in fresh every day and it's amazing and the service is great and blah blah blah. I like that they offer a locals discount. That's awesome. But overall, I wasn't blown away. The salad I ordered was OK, it LOOKS great, but flavor wise, I really felt it was lacking. The veggie roll I ordered was cool. I've never seen some of the veggies they used in it. But again, something was missing. I like when your food just hits all the right notes and I didn't think either of my dishes did that. The service is eh. Nothing amazing, but not horrible. I would eat here again, but I dont see this as a '\"go to for me."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Went in for the first time and didnt know what sake would pair with our meal.  Thankfully Bianca steered us in the right direction!!!  The Albacore Tataki was amazing and the atmosphere was great.  Will return for sure.  If you go to Sushi Roku order the Albacore Tataki and ask for Bianca if you can!!!"}
{"text":"This is more than 3, but not as good as 4 Japanese restaurant & bar. The place is in the W hotel, right next to the lobby. Location is good, parking is convenient. Love the decoration, very contemporary. (It is a lovely place to have a drink and at the same time get some sushi & sashimi.) we went there for lunch, so didn't have drink. (Not sure about the drinking price) they have lunch bento box, and you may order two from the list. Love the flexibility and the combination."}
{"text":"My second chance to visit this place again. And I think my first visit was a bad day for me. This time everything is good.  The choice of Chef selection of sushi is too fusion, but it taste very good and adventurous."}
{"text":"Best Sushi I've ever had.  Get the crispy, spciy, ahi role... divine."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place.  Probably the best place I ate at all weekend. lets see what we ate:
-Crunchy Spicy Tuna: had avocado, spicy tuna, spicy mayo sauce and a crunchy topping it was AMAZING! i loved it
-Baked Lobster Roll: baked lobster, rice paper roll, asparagus, miso sauce.  it was all wrapped up and then baked and the miso sauce is nice and toasted and warm it was soo delicious
-spicy scallop roll: i had the cut roll not the hand roll. honestly it was just okkay. nothing super spectacular
-shrimp fried rice: pretty yummy just your basic fried rice we all shared it and it was good
-miso soup: perfect not too salty but just right
I mean lets be honestly everything in Vegas is expensive so I don't think the prices were outraged compared to everywhere else. I think for the price it is way better then anywhere else that we went.  If u are a sushi lover like I am then i think you will enjoy this place and bonus ITS AIR CONDITIONED inside the mall so its nice!"}
{"text":"I went there with a group of friends during summer. The hostess seated us on the main dining room, it has a gorgeous view of the strip and the restaurant's decor was beautiful. I asked the hostess if we could have the happy hour menu and she went to ask the manager, then she came back and told us we had to move to another table. There were on the other side and there was no beautiful view and we sat beside a big group of table who were very loud, we had to speak up to talk to each other. Anyways, the food was pretty good and fresh. I cannot remember what we ordered but the price were reasonable and we had a nice time."}
{"text":"Amazing food
Fantastic service 
Great decor
What more could you ask for
Desert- the chocolate volcano, chocolate filled donut holes or fresh berries"}
{"text":"Ordered the free ranged chicken. It was dry and tough to eat. Overall experience is over priced food for mediocre quality"}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday night for happy hour with a girl friend, the bartender recommended some great dishes and drinks. The bartender, I didn't get his name, recommended we try the Smoked Old Fashion and the Pear Martini, both fantastic presentation and flavor. You'll have to try them!Our favorites on the happy hour menu were the Tai with black salt, spicy tuna with fried rice cakes, and the beef and shrimp skewers.
Food took a couple extra minutes to come out but was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"We ate here this past weekend for my Birthday dinner. Overall it's an okay restaurant. The interior decoration is steller and the views of the strip were amazing!

Our waitress also threw in a bottle of sake and if it's your birthday you get this fiery faux drink type thingy and everyone sings happy birthday so I suppose I would recommend for a special occasion. 

That being said the food wasn't anything to rave about. Living in SF it's hard to visit another city and not be a culinary snob, but I've eaten at some amazing spots in Vegas and this place did not live up. 

When our food arrived it appeared to have been sitting for awhile waiting to be delivered (e.g the sauce looked like something out of a microwave meal and the ginger was browning).  So I wasn't that impressed. The service was mid grade for not being that busy I was a bit suprised by the lack of attentiveness. 

If you go expect great ambiance and average food!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love sushi. But you're really paying for the location because the food is not all that. Service is kinda slow too."}
{"text":"Really good deal for happy hour.  The food is excellent.  
But for dinner it was way too pricy.   The standard sushi wasn't anything special.  But the pricier items were tasty - like the yellow tail with chilli and ponzu."}
{"text":"Phoenix is in the middle of a desert, but the fish here may suggest otherwise. The chef's choice nigiri sampler is as fresh as what you would find on a coastal city, and the garnishes on the nigiri are distinctive, innovative, and absolutely delicious.
I also loved the Chilean Seabass and Roasted Cauliflower- two dishes I try at most restaurants I visit- and I was definitely impressed. These are classic dishes done extremely well, and while the bits at the bottom were soaked in sauce and overly salty, they were still happily devoured.
Restaurant vibes were great as well-clean, modern, and a great spot for dates/business dinners/when you feel like getting fancy."}
{"text":"Pathetic service. We made a reservation for dinner this evening at 6pm. 90% of the seats were open in the restaurant when we arrived. They seated us the worst table in the restaurant. They refused to move us to another table when there were plenty open. This is so unusual where in other restaurants if you don't like being squeezed into an undesirable place, they move you on request. We left without having dinner there and went elsewhere . We would never consider them in our future dining plans. 100 Rotten tomatoes."}
{"text":"Great view of the strip and good sushi. I like the dim lighting and it wasn't very busy late in the evening on a Monday."}
{"text":"The oysters were amazing would definitely recommend this place delicious fish and very clean."}
{"text":"Ok, but not that great.  Very nice atmosphere, but sushi was just ok.  I really wanted Shibuya at MGM, but for some reason they were closed all week."}
{"text":"We made a reservation here via the Yelp App for a Saturday evening of Labor Day. We had a prime table for Scottsdale people watching - from couples to bachelor/bachelorette parties we saw it all here. 

We had the bake crab hand roll, asparagus wrapped in beef, and sashimi sampler. Everything was fresh and tasty, but I certainly wish that they had gluten free soy sauce. I would assumed a restaurant this expensive and in a hotel would accommodate gluten free people. 

Due to no soy sauce for me, I wouldn't come back for sushi but maybe I'd try something else. Service was fine for a busy Saturday night, but nothing spectacular to share."}
{"text":"chain in LA, upscale. most entrees over marinated.  not as good as katsuya.
Tuna Sashimi Carpaccio with Sesame Soy & Garlic Chips was ok with the chip crumbles.
wouldn't recommend uni udon, which doesn't even use udon noodle.  several items try to be like morimoto but not close.  like Popcorn Shrimp Tempura with Miso Glaze.
brussels sprouts with bacon and yuzu.  too heavy on the sauce but tastes ok.
braised short rib, not the kakuni falling apart texture.
specials section, had the white lotus roll. ikura was acceptable."}
{"text":"We had 3 birthday at the same time last night everything was awesome nice place and great service perfect hospitality but I forget to ask our servers name and her food runner they were very nice and kind and perfect service I like her smile and her patience ."}
{"text":"Very good sushi. GREAT view. Good service... all of the recommendations my waiter made were great.

favorite dish was the tuna w/ cilantro and shrimp roll. delicious."}
{"text":"Because the buffet at the Flamingo I'd originally chosen to go to had closed that day for remodeling (lucky me), I had to find an alternative. I ended my search at Sushi Roku. I sat at the bar and my server, an inked young lady whose name slips my mind, cordially suggested their Happy Hour menu. I obliged and quite honestly, I had ten very good sushi rolls and a drink for around $15, a 1/4 of what they wanted for the buffet at the opposite end of the Palace. I had the spicy tuna and something with salmon. Both were fresh, not over spiced so much that you couldn't taste the fish, and a nice serving. Service was attentive, quick and spot on with the recommendation. I'll stop in here again if I get a Jones for sushi while on the strip. The lounge itself is rather nice as well and would make a quality spot for a dinner date too, if I had a date (groan...). Maybe next time."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on 01/13/17. Place is very hip and comfortable with lots of people enjoying dinner and celebrating occasions (make a reservation). Service was decent. Took a little bit for the waiter to get to us, but was still okay.

We ordered lots of different sushi rolls and shared them among our table of four, that seems to be the best way to go. My favorites and biggest standouts were the Shishito Peppers (so good), the Black Cod is jaw-dropping, blow-your-mind delicious and also loved the Crab Dynamite Sushi Roll. 

We would not hesitate to eat here again."}
{"text":"Short Review:

THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE 5 STAR RESTAURANT!!

Long Review:

Nestled within Scottsdale W, a 5 STAR RESORT, is Scottsdale's SUSHI ROKU, a 5 STAR RESTAURANT.

ABOUT SUSHI ROKU

Sushi Roku is part of IDG, Innovative Dinning Group. IDG owns and operates, SUSHI ROKU, ROKU, BOA STEAKHOUSE, KATANA, and ROBATA BAR.

Sushi Roku combines the finest, freshest fish from pristine waters around the globe with the kind of artistry that can only be provided by a mature sushi chef ensuring traditional sushi, together with a splash of contemporary California innovation.

Sushi Roku has locations in Santa Monica, Pasadena, Newport Beach, Las Vegas, and Scottsdale.

THE STORY

I've had the pleasure of eating at Sushi Roku a couple of times, and it never disappoints. The last visit was OUTSTANDING!

We started with one of their sake flights (see pic). Their sake flights are innovative and bold, and included some Arizona sakes. We had a couple appetizers, including the A-5 Japanese Wagyu Ishi-Yaki, which is grilled over a bincho charcoal, was the best meat that has ever been in my mouth. Sushi Roku's Wagyu appetizer alone is worth the visit. Everything was unique and fresh, and had DELICIOUS BOLD FLAVORS. We ended with desert, the lemon soufflé, which was not only the perfect finale to the meal, but my photo was featured in their instagram! instagram.com/sushirokuaz (see pic)

SERVICE EXPERIENCE

The service was EXCEPTIONAL! We were treated like royalty and our main server was so fun and enjoyable, we kept mentioning that he should have his own show. It was the type of interaction that added to the meal, and was non obtrusive, which I always appreciate.

CONCLUSION

This restaurant is a gem! This is truly one of the best dining experiences I've had lately. As long as nothing changes, I would happily eat here again and again! I hope I get a chance to experience Sushi Roku's other locations too!

5/5 RECOMMEND

{"text":"Had a couple of really good appetizers here back in December for happy hour. 
Just needed a quick bite before the Shania Twain show. This place fit the bill..
Both the calamari and chicken satay skewers tasted great.. Along with that enjoyed a nice tasting glass of nicely chilled white wine.. Sat at the bar and enjoyed friendly efficient service and the price was right.. Will definitely be back next time in Vegas"}
{"text":"On our last visit to LV, we had lunch at Sushi Roku based on a friend's recommendation and I'm glad we did. 

Everything was absolutely delicious. Each dish was prepared with thought  and was full of flavor. It was quite an expensive meal for the amount of food but it was definitely worth it. Quality over quantity."}
{"text":"Been here twice, and I love almost everything about this place. The restaurant itself is a site to be seen and the view of the strip is just as ppealing. I've tried almost everything from the sushi, to the kobe beef and tempura and being a veteran of many high end Japanese restaurants I'll put this place up there with the best. 

The staff and service was also top top... and if you ever get a chance to come say hi to the GM Kenji!"}
{"text":"There was something just a little off about this restaurant.  Maybe the fact that it was virtually deserted influenced my perception, but the interior was just too dark and gloomy, this despite the fact that our table had a picture window view of the Las Vegas strip in its full neon glory.

The hostess seated us at a table that was broken--the bench seat backs were gone and were \"being repaired.\"  There were at least two other similar tables on either side of us, so I dont know why she seated us there.

At first our server had a bit of an attitude, but she became very pleasant later on, so I forgive that.

Anyway, the sushi was okay, not spectacular.  I did enjoy the monk fish liver.  But the California roll was mealy.  Also, eel is suppose to be served warm, mine was cold and tasted refrigerated.  The tempura was kinda greasy, which is just unacceptable.  The Saki selections and mixed drinks were very good.  

Overall, a ho-hum experience.  Maybe I'm spoiled by the sushi restaurants in San Francisco, but this place just isnt up to snuff."}
{"text":"Overall: good but meh.

I have been staying at the W in Scottsdale for work for the past month, so I've eaten here a few times.  The sushi is pretty good, but honestly nothing spectacular.  Pretty standard special rolls.  Definitely nothing wrong about it.  I have also had the chicken entree.  The eggplant appetizer might take the cake at this place.  

The overall vibe reminds me of the W hotel.  It's trying a little too hard to be trendy.  Dim lights (like, too dim... I've bumped into a couple people here because I can't see two feet in front of me.   Can I get a little more than 2 watts up in here?), modern decor, etc. etc.  It's a good go-to for hotel guests, but I wouldn't travel out of my way to go."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch over the weekend & had such an amazing experience. Food was fantastic & service was spectacular!! I will definitely return & tell all my friends about this place!"}
{"text":"Solid spot, crystal makes great drinks. I stay down the street but this sushi spot and customer service will Make me change my hotel."}
{"text":"Basically overpriced sushi and poor quality. I was not impressed by this place at all.. 
This place is so dark inside I couldn't even read my menu properly."}
{"text":"I was on a work trip last week and went here  after being recommended this restaurant by one of my coworkers that has been to Las Vegas many times.  They had a happy hour menu so we started with some drinks off of that but they also had sushi rolls and appetizers for a discounted price.  My coworkers had the spicy salmon rolls off the menu and enjoyed those.  We then had some of the sushi rolls off of the regular and everything was very fresh.  We sat at the bar and the service by the bartender was very good."}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh and first rate.  Had a party of ten. However, service was spotty. Pushy waitress, Agnes, who I had to repeatedly call over put a bad taste in my mouth, constantly trying to get me to order the most expensive items and more than I needed. Was so bold that she then wrote in a hefty tip for herself on our bill! Diners beware!"}
{"text":"I am freaking out over how good this Hanabi is (Spicy Tuna over Crispy Rice). I can't even. I literally ordered another! Lol."}
{"text":"Brussels sprout chips are omg delish!  Also had the sweet potato roll, also very yummy. Service was excellent and fast. Location is on the 3rd floor of the forum shops at Caesar. Seriously try those Brussels sprout chips...the truffle oil on top is sooooo yummy!"}
{"text":"Waaaaaahhhh, this review is a long time coming as I've been here 5x within the last year.

Whether it be during happy hour (which is the best sushi happy hour you can get in Vegas) to restaurant week (best choices of prie fix menu); and best of all their anniversary week (50% off food menu); EVERYTHING was melt-in-your-mouth amazing.

I'll just name off my favorites: 
- foie gras and scallops
- yellowtail sashimi
- shishito peppers
- tofu steak
- grilled filet
- tuna tataki
- oysters with gold flakes
- waygu sashimi
-oysters with gold flakes
-fois gras wrapped in yellowtail

Foie and ANYTHING is just B.O.M.B.

One of the many reasons Sushi Roku is uhhh-maaaaze =)"}
{"text":"Had a business dinner here and it was really good! I had shushito peppers, which were tasty and flavorful. Then the amberjack sushi (2 pieces) and an eel roll. That was enough food for me and I typically get 3-4 rolls at other sushi places. I really enjoyed this."}
{"text":"Robert is a diligent server. He was obliging and great at suggestions of fish to our preference on the menu selection. He went above and beyond to retrieve the sake sommelier to better acquire our taste pallets and table service. 

The wine sommelier's name was Steve. He was knowledge in the different rices and their fermation process. We choose the Otokoyama. They warmed it up for us. Delicious. It is dry and medium in fullness, without the sweet after flavor that I am personally not fond of. 


We enjoyed the Brussels sprouts, blue crab tartare, and a special that is not on the menu, but to die for, big eye tuna carpaccio. Then, we ordered the crab handrolls and finished with the matzu platter."}
{"text":"The food was horrible.  Do not go here.  The only thing that was decent was the beef teriyaki and seaweed salad."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku used to be our favorite sushi restaurant in the area. We've been here to celebrate an anniversary, a birthday, and fun date nights whenever we got the craving for sushi. Unfortunately, the quality seems to have declined in the past year. Our most recent experience left a bad taste in our mouth and I don't think we'll be returning any time soon.

We came here on a Friday night before the Christmas holiday and were surprised the restaurant was playing such loud club music. We joked that we felt we were eating on the dance floor. The ambiance just wasn't as inviting or classy as it was previously. Things went downhill from here.. 

The Katana Roll was not as flavorful as it has been in the past and the presentation was different. For a $17 \"specialty sushi roll\" we were expecting something special and were left quite disappointed.

The Caterpillar Roll was also not as good as it has been in the past. I could've sworn that this inside out roll used to include crab meat inside, but our server said that I must be thinking of their Dragon Roll. I highly doubt it because the Dragon Roll isn't even on the menu. In any case, this roll was also quite disappointing and definitely not worth the hefty $16 price. The roll had a tiny piece of unagi inside, which was cold rather than hot and freshly cooked. 

All in all, quite disappointing and sad that the quality of this once 5 star place has declined to the point that I can't rate it higher than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Agree with other reviewers. Expensive but it's located in the W so I would expect to pay $17 a roll (not with a smile.) Sushi was fresh but nothing unique or interesting. Straightforward. Shima roll with jalapeño is a nice fresh spicy choice. If you're looking for a no thrills sushi place with a lounge vibe and good service this will do you great."}
{"text":"HAD A GREAT TIME !!!!!!!
Service and Food Quality was fantastic. Great Server, suggested some of the best sushi I have ever had. My wife doesn't care for seafood so she ordered a Filet, it was great. We will return !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a night of new taste experiences for me.  We arrived and the atmosphere was very light, ambient, and loungy.  No surprises since this is at the W Hotel.  The restaurant staff was very friendly, and we were greeted fairly quickly.  We ordered the edamame which was a first for me, (I'm behind the times on this one)  A nice different taste.   I ordered a blackberry smash which was nothing short of wonderful.  I definitely could have ordered a double.  Another person in our party had a cold sake that I found was soo good, I had to try it twice.  Our waiter was very friendly, down to earth and low key.  Amongst us we ordered some sushi, I ordered the Ji-Dori chicken and the other person in our group ordered the Braised Pork.  Apparently they were out of pork so that was not available which was a disappointment.   Food was out at a decent time and the sauce with the mushrooms and potatoes had a wonderful zing and afterbite.  Our sushi eater had his eyes rolling back the entire time with his head agaisnt the booth so I can only assume the experience was nothing short of orgasmic.  We only had a small snafu with a groupon discount, but that was corrected without issue.  I'll be sure again to come to try the pork and have multiple blackberry smashes.  Even though I have not been won over to try sushi, I'm more than willing to have this restaurant experience again."}
{"text":"Japanese food + fine dining = usually not a logical mix unless we're talking omakase or kaiseki. However, Sushi Roku did a pretty good job of taking care of my friends' birthday dinner here. 

Recommendation #1: Chilean sea bass with truffle miso glaze. Though it's listed as an appetizer it was big enough to be an entree.

Recommendation #2: Kurobuta kakuni. I ordered this for myself, but the rest of the birthday party descended on it like a flock of vultures before I even got a bite.  The plate came back to me with only the veggies and brown rice :( but I'm guessing the pork was really good?

I would recommend Sushi Samba at the Palazzo over Sushi Roku only because Samba has a more unique menu that imo is worth shelling out a few extra bucks for.  But if you're looking for more traditional Japanese flavors, Roku gives you more bang for your buck in a similarly high end setting."}
{"text":"Always great service and good food. A great variety of raw and cooked items. A view of the Ling Hotel and the strip."}
{"text":"If you know great sushi, this is what You are are searching for! 

They have a great knowledge of the saki and the sushi is just perfect... stick to the sashimi and carpaccio."}
{"text":"Dinner was absolutely delicious. We had the special and 2 rolls. We also had 2 lychee martinis that hit the spot. We requested a table by their magnificent view and they agreed with a smile. We will definitely dine here on our next trip to Vegas. They get 4 stars because of price."}
{"text":"Cute place. The interior is very upscale, and intimate. It's a nice place to have a nice romantic dinner with the love. I would suggest to request the strip view when dinning in because the strip view is just lovely. 

The menu is ok. I personally prefer authentic Japanese cuisine at a local area (Spring Mountain!), but there are a few things here that I like. Their signature martinis are good! I would definitely recommend the Lychee martini. You get a big piece of Lychee as a garnish, and you can taste the Lychee flavor of the martini. So if you are all for a nice sweet taste to your martini I'd definitely recommend it.

Our group ordered the Seared Tuna Tataki, Seaweed Salad, Yellowtail Sashimi, Crunchy Spicy Tuna, Rock Shrimp Tempura, and Chicken Yakitori Skewers. To me, it was nothing special or anything that stands out to where I feel like this place might be the only place to satisfy a distinct craving. The food is very light, fish is fresh, and the portions are small. 

I haven't tried the Omakase yet, but I would like to actually try it once to see if it is worth spending $90 for. The Omakase might be the only thing worth gambling on. All in all the experience was nice and the service was wonderful. If you don't mind burning a big hole in your pocket for a nice fine dining experience, and a small stomach and appetite then I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Asked the server if the chef did omakase and we were very pleased with what came out of the kitchen and from the sushi bar. Great service decor and food."}
{"text":"At a lower price point, this would be a commanding 4 star restaurant, but it fails to deliver for the high expectations it sets nestled in Caesar's Palace at about $50 a person.

Sushi is solid, but nothing your usual local Sushi bar won't offer for 12-15 a roll. Service is somewhat irritating- kept coming back too often and wouldn't let me have a decent conversation.

Start with an edamame; try the Filet Mignon Asparagus."}
{"text":"I went to Sushi Roku for lunch one day in LA and wasn't a big fan.  Since they opened in Scottsdale though and I love sushi, I thought I would give it another try.  It was only the second weekend they have been open so considering we had to wait an hour for our reservation wasn't so bad because the whole world seemed to be there so talking to everyone made the time pass quickly.  I didn't even think I was in Scottsdale.  Just watching the crowded scene at Sushi Roku and the W Hotel was enough to keep anyone occupied.  They offered us the sushi bar at one point but we opted to wait for a table since it was more of where the action seemed to be.  We got our table and instantly started eating because 1. The table sitting next to us starting sharing their sweet potato chips with us and 2. They brought us edamame without us even ordering it (that scores huge with me)!  At this point since we had waited for a while we weren't starving so we ordered the baked lobster roll and the yellowtail sashimi with diced chilies.  I was hesitant about ordering the lobster roll because I thought it would be heavy and it was actually the opposite - very light.  The yellowtail was so unbelievable I could eat it everyday, all day.  Now the table on the other side of us starting sharing their filet mignon wrapped in asparagus which was very tasty.  They also started pouring us their sake as well which was great!  The ahi tuna carpaccio arrived compliments of the owner as well as a dessert.  All of the desserts sounded so good we told our waitress to surprise us.  She brought some type of egg rolls with ice cream but we were too full to eat them so we reciprocated and gave them to the table next to us.  Our waitress for a new restaurant was perfect.  She was nice, friendly and knowledgeable.  The owner came to sit with us as we were finishing up and was asking ideas of where to possibly open a Boa Steakhouse (also one of LA's amazing restaurants that Innovative Dining Group owns).  I was so excited and told him that Scottsdale Quarter would be the perfect place for Boa.  Now we started our venture to the W Hotel Pool Bar.  To be able to describe all of this would definitely need its own review.  It was a little chaotic at first (with the line, etc - but we ended up only having to wait five minutes), but it turned out to be such a fun night.  I can't wait to go back and hope it stays this way for a while (not because it just opened).   It was fun running into so many people there as well all in a new atmosphere which was very cool.  I loved the pool!  I'll leave it at that and let Gabi write more on this since I wrote about Sushi Roku :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi and creative desserts to top it off! Sleek and cool ambiance with service that isn't rushed. You may want to give yourself extra time though if you're seeing a show after dinner or are on a tight schedule.

This is a nice spot for sushi and more. There were some pretty unique dishes...a sea bass with black truffle oil for appetizer was really good. The sea bass was so tender and yummy. There was a caulifower with some very light breading that was very good too.

For sushi - the fish seemed really fresh and melted in your mouth. We didn't try the really unusual rolls though - they had some pricey ones.

What I remember was the dessert. The green tea mousse was light and airy topped with matcha powder. The apple fritter with dulce de leche ice cream was very good too. They have a chocolate souffle on the menu too but we were running late so we did not try it.

They also had a variety of sake and cocktails so there's something for everyone here whether you like sushi or not."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, nice waitstaff, awesome cocktails and the food....I had this lobster sushi (I don't recall the name) that was to die for.  I had never really had sushi before, at least not as a meal and I have to say I was impressed."}
{"text":"Oh where do I begin ... 
So we arrive -- 10 min before our reservation time of 9p. We didn't get seated until 40 min after the hour. To be squeezed in a booth -- set up for 6. Although our party is of 7. Asked for an additional place setting 2x before received. 
The waiter, an underaged looking young man, id's us after getting our drink order, and takes 15-20 min to return with said drinks. And serves us tap water after clearly stating bottled. 
The food... Sushi- subpar... The entrees- burnt... He said it was \"smoked\" ... Yea no, it's burned buddy. Drinks - weak!
The people... So, this woman has her child.. Yes child ...  sitting at the table with underwear and no shoes and she's making out with this gentleman while her child is damn near naked. (Side eye)
Shall I say.. Never again!"}
{"text":"Overpriced sushi, underwhelming small portion specialties, and arrogant, W-type servers. A scene for some (skanky women and douchey men in trucker hats), overpriced hotel food for most."}
{"text":"Don't let the $$$ discourage you... this place is worth it. I got a little bit of everything to make sure I covered my taste palette. Everything from a simple spicy tuna roll, fried rice, seared salmon sashimi, and ramen. Everything was full of flavor and good sized portions. In case you need more spice, you can request even more spices to give your entree more of a kick.

The service was excellent! The manager checked in regularly and even showed me the correct way to eat the seared salmon sashimi. I even forgot my sunglasses and got them back the next day. The hostess and server remembered me and asked about my dinner."}
{"text":"TOTALLY COMING BACK HERE!!  

My absolute favorite thing to order here is the SPICY TUNA CRISPY RICE! It was soo good i ordered two! MMM dreaming about it as I type.

I ordered the bento box too from the lunch special. BLACK COD and SHORT RIB? HELLLLL YESS!! I loved everything in the bento box! EVERYYYTHING :))) I would totally order this again! The miso soup was delicious too!

The people working here were reallyyy nice and the view was incredible! I am definitely coming back here and I am excited about it! YAY!"}
{"text":"We were here on a Saturday night and we're so happy that they were able to fit us in for a last minute reservation. We both ordered the omekase and it was some of the best sushi we've had. My favorite was the toro. They also had a dish that was like a Japanese crab cake (yum!). The panko crusted sea bass (omg)! I forgot to take a photo of the first dish. Everything was amazing. I was sitting in my seat filled with joy because of the flavors and textures of the food. So happy that we went with the omekase even though it was pricey. We think it was totally worth it. 

The ambience of the restaurant is classy and they have a great view of the strip. It is located in the Forum Shops on the third floor. I wore my heels that day and boy, did I wish I wore flats. We did quite a bit of walking to and from the restaurant. 

Anywho, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Mediocre.
I went safe with a spicy tuna cut roll and it looked good but the consistency was like mush.  There was nothing else in there to give it that crunch that makes them so good.  Also, the only thing that looked good in the sushi case was yellowtail and it had excellent consistency but lacked flavor.  The miso soup was too salty at a rip off at $4.  I ate here for convenience only (stayed at the W).  Definitely a skippable experience."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. The only I gave this place any stars is because the food was actually pretty good but the customer service is so bad here I don't ever want to come back. They waitress is rude!! We came here for lunch and spent $200 bucks for just a few people. The waitress serving us never smiled and when she made a mistake in bringing us the wrong order and after we told her about her she like\" oh worries..I will get another one...no apologies, no ownership that she made a mistake..: there is soooo many places to eat in Vegas. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The sushi was better than ok. The curry flavored sushi was not a hit, don't know the name of it now. We ate there last friday night  with the kiddies without a reservation and there was no wait. Wait staff was nice. They offered us free dessert afterwards, don't know why, i think the hostess was enamored with my daughter, who knows? The bill for two adults was 166- so a little pricey. the sashimi with chiles was my favorite."}
{"text":"Spend a lot of my Friday night happy hours here! Great food and the bartenders are so awesome and friendly! Get here early to get a spot in the bar for happy hour"}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Only to be outdone by the service- our waiter, whose name I can't recall but he had a great beard, was freaking awesome! We were a bit late to our dinner reservation so we only had 45 min to eat before our show- he had our whole order at out table in 20 min! The other wait staff was equally awesome and super attentive- never a half empty glass at our table! Would definitely return and give my highest recommendation! Every dish was just as yummy as the last!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! We had a group of 21. Service was quick and friendly.  Food was outstanding.  I had the chefs special plate of 8 sushi pieces.  The sushi was different than I have ever had and was just as good as the sushi in Tokyo."}
{"text":"Prepare for long waits, being ignored and incompetent staff. Food was good but between screwing up my order (they gave me a menu that was no longer valid so I waited twenty minutes for an order that never came) and a bartender who ignored my existence, never again.

Updating. The manager comped my meal and the food was good. Upgrading to three stars until I try again."}
{"text":"Yummy mix of traditional and Californian style sushi - some wicked combinations but a little bastardised at times [sacrificing the simple elegance of quality ingredients for loud and bold flavours].  Flavour comment above may be more of a personal preference than a 'criticism' as I enjoy the simplicity of more traditional Japanese fare.

Busy vibe and great service.

Favourite dishes: yellowtail sashimi with crispy onions, fillet wrapped asparagus and the sinful [yet shamefully un-Japanese] mouth watering popcorn shrimp morsels."}
{"text":"Dinner food was excellent! Restaurant week 3 course dinner did not disappoint!

We were seated right away at one of the window tables and got a stunning view of the strip. The restaurant decor was tasteful, elegant, zen, modern, but still inviting. There was 2 choices for 1st course and 2nd course on the restaurant week menu, so we decided to order both and share. Each appetizer came with 3 different items, so we got a total of 6, and every one of them was amazing! We then shared the surf and turf, and the chef's sushi selection. I would have to say that the sushi here is the best I've had in town. It's better than Nobu, better than Blue Ribbon, better than Samba, and better than Raku. Then to complete our meal, the trio mousse just completely satisfied my palette, beautifully presented, and tasted just as beautiful.

Our service was a bit lacking, my tea was filled here and there, but not constantly. Other than that, it was a great experience, and I would definitely be returning to try some of the other"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best sushi restaurant  in Las Vegas. 
Expensive but worth it. 
I ate lunch there with 3 friends and we were all blown away from the Kobe beef appetizer to the toro to urchin. All of the tuna you can imagine. 

Atmosphere is great, service is great and of course the food is great. 

This is the place for top notch sushi."}
{"text":"Why are you wasting time reading this?  You need to go to Orbitz or Expedia, something and book tickets to Vegas just to eat here.  I mean it.  There is no time to gamble, catch a show, or hang out in front of the Bellagio.  
This is the BEST sushi i have ever had in my entire life.  (Trust me- I am old and I have lived in Japan.)
I suggest you bring zip locks to line your coat so that you can bring home  black truffle tempura hand rolls in your purse. I don't know how food safe that would be but  it makes me smile just thinking about!
We had a fabulous meal with an incredible view and just being there in a beautifully designed place.    Very nice attention to detail.
I looked through the review remarks about the price and I will say this- again, I am old- you get what you pay for and the food here is worth paying for!"}
{"text":"This was really the only restaurant I went to in Vegas that didn't let me down for the price. Overall, dining in Vegas is quite a challenge. For the upscale eaters like myself, things feel overhyped and overpriced. Not this place. I ordered a raw sushi combo and the fish was fresh, large pieces and with a beautiful presentation. Service was prompt and the environment was pleasant. The edamame was also notably good...I make edamame at home so it's not very easy to impress me, but that was good. Would definitely go again"}
{"text":"This one is hard. The whole place is conflicted between excellence and douchetasticness.

THE GOOD (aka: the food)
If you've been to another Roku, or even a Nobu, the menu will look familiar, as will the prices.

The sushi selection was pretty deep, with a good specials list, and lots of options. All the fish was very fresh, and as good as you can get in Phoenix, unless you're a regular somewhere else and get the special stuff. My benchmark for this is 'saba'. Usually, if you're not a regular somewhere, you get the dried out, pickled-herring tasting stuff. But Roku sent out the good stuff. Moist and delicious.

The sushi rice was excellent. Some of the portions were a bit awkward, with the rice ball minimized maybe to make the top portion seem larger...? But very good. I would sit at the bar next time.

The hot and cold plates were of the standard \"inventive new japanese\" type, but very well executed.


THE OKAY (aka: the bar)
Decent selection of beers and sake. Some frou frou specialty cocktails. But if you can't make a Vodka Tonic, you're fired. That wasn't tonic. Sent it back, came back again. Not tonic. 1 of 3 things going on here:

1) waitress screwed up twice (doubtful, she seemed competent and sober)
2) bartender screwed up twice
3) tonic is on tap, and tap was screwed up and only delivering carbonation and no syrup. if so, the bartender isn't checking the taps - see #2 above.

I like a Vodka Soda too, so I let it slide and didn't send it back again.


THE UGLY (aka: the overal l experience)
Normally, a W hotel is a chill spot in every city. You can count on upscale and relatively low key business/pleasure travelers, great service. Cool vibe. But I'm afraid this W will be plagued by the same velvet rope bullshit that haunted the James and Mondrian when they first opened. 

We scurried through the lobby and were greeted by a nicely scripted hostess (who knew how to work the reservations system), and an Atlantic City magician in a Sushi Roku host's suit (who didn't know how to work the reservations system). Guido act in full effect. At least he didn't punch us in the face or anything. Probably not fair to judge him. I'm sorry. He's probably a nice guy, but the demeanor doesn't fit the place. I would be floored if he could point to Japan on a map. Or if he punched me in the face.

The decor is very upscale, modern and generally over-the-top, but well done.

Then as we get escorted in...
Host bellows a Jersey Shore approximation of \"Irrasshai!\", to which all 3000 or so staff bellow back \"IRRASSHAI!!!\" This happens EVERY FUCKING TIME a new party is seated. The only thing louder was the table of seemingly underage rich kids getting hammered for someone's 19th birthday. \"We're bombin, dude!\" I think \"bombin\" means ruining both your sake and beer by mixing them in the same glass. The table was out of control and acted like they were at a Super Sweet 16, but were not approached by mgmt, as far as we could see. 

Elsewhere, cougars on the prowl. Some horrified rich people. And some troubled foodies.


OVERALL
The food was very good . The experience was pretty cheesy. Some of the staff must find it hard not to chuckle when they're trying to prepare and serve A+ dishes. They need to tone it down to keep a return business. The sake bomber crowd isn't gonna keep coming back at $100/head, and fine diners don't want their conversations (and even thoughts) drowned out by Vegas theatrics, unnecessary \"security\" and obnoxious guests. The servers are very young and inexperienced, and still in script mode. They need to be able to read when a table doesn't need to be taught about a menu. But I imagine the ones who make it will relax and hit a groove if management lets them.

We'll head back to the bar on a week night, as far away from the \"show\" as possible, and enjoy some sushi."}

{"text":"I set up reservations for 2 for a birthday dinner. The service was excellent, they comp'd any dessert on the menu for the birthday and they even served the dish with a sparkler. I would highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion/dinner."}

The Chicken Skewers are very tasty.  The Teriyaki Sauce they are glazed are sweet and have the right amount of \"sour\" kick to it to balance the flavor.  The Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus is awesome...the Filet is tender and juicy and the Asparagus compliments it well.  Of course, the Chocolate Cake dessert is a nice ending for the meal.

The service can be a bit slow at times, depends on the server.  Generally speaking, it's pretty good considering how busy they are.

The people watching here is pretty good...watching all of the hipsters is hilarious.

{"text":"I ate here 5 or 6 times now. In fact... I'm eating here currently haha. so idk if that makes it 7 times or what. pretty much I eat here whenever I can because it's the best sushi in the best location with the best chefs: Jason, Kyle, the blonde guy and Shu San. All very friendly, and skilled. Jason taught me all about soy paper haha. 

The fish is all good. Bomb ass uni, but the baked crab roll was my drug of choice lately.  Way too good for $11.  I ate 45 of them lol, jk. 12oz of hot sake for $10. Good skewers as well. Really I don't think you can go wrong here. It's really very good bang for your buck here. I've had omakase a while back and it's was really beautiful and delicious. Good salmon nigiri, hella good snapper,  real wasabi, etc.. it's all good here. 

Good loud bar in back but it's not part of sushi roku. But roku has its own bar as well. Really good service maybe they like me extra but the hosts, waitresses and chefs and everyone are very intelligent and helpful and super nice to me!"}
{"text":"So far this has been the best sushi I've had in Phoenix. If you can overlook the loud music, you'll appreciate the ambiance which is young and classy. Lots of beautiful women and clean shaven men to look at which made this evening worth the steep bill."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party of about 20 people.  The sashimi was so small I ate all 4 pieces in one bite.  After that disappointment I got my sushi.  I got the jalepeno roll.  Wasn't very spicy.  All in all average sushi.  This was a birthday party for 3 people I will add and by the time they brought out the birthday cake over half the party had left as we had finished our meal about an hour prior and there was only a handful of people left.

At the end of the night the wait staff tried to charge us all for items we didn't order which included $65 dollars in bottled water.  After we disagreed we asked to speak to a manager who shrugged the whole thing off and walked off during our conversation (possibly to admire his over priced suit in the mirror) leaving us wondering what the outcome was.  About 20 minutes later we decided to finally leave.  Not paying for overpriced bottled water.

This place is probably perfect for you if you want to get drunk and go upstairs and listen to horrible dance music after a average to below average meal"}
{"text":"Okay. So they don't have Malibu Rum. But their sparkling sake is the bomb!! Food is okay. But really, are you going for the food... or the party??"}
{"text":"My fave sushi place in Vegas! The view is killer, food is amazing and the drinks are FANTASTIC.  Try the filet mignon-wrapped asparagus and any of the sashimis--wash it down with a spicy passion and spice...I order mine with muddled serranos instead of jalapenos and it's DELISH.  The manager is super nice as well!  All of the staff are very attentive and helpful, and it's a great place for lunch or dinner.  I'm there every time I visit at LEAST once!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi experiences of my life. I ordered the 8 piece chef's tasting plate and was very impressed. Each piece was so interesting and delicious. A bit pricey but very worth it. The crab roll is crazy good too."}
{"text":"Short Story:
Vegas has some good sushi?!  I'm surprised...

Long Story:
I came here for lunch on Thursday, and it was not crowded.  We were promptly seated and we ordered the Karaage appetizer, the Teriyaki salmon, and the beef Teriyaki.  All the dishes were good and they came with sashimi.  I got to say, the sashimi was good, though I didn't have high expectations as this was Vegas...and not hear the coast.  It did take a bit of time to get our food, but it was forgivable.  

Verdict:
I would go back if and when I go back to Vegas.  Though I'm sure there are other good places to go too."}
{"text":"2 words to describe this restaurant - Par Excellence!

Service was exemplary. Our waiter gave us the right suggestions and the food was prepared in a timely manner. The restaurant was busy but there was no room for error.

Right from the appetizers to the entrees - sushi and sashimi, everything was prepared to perfection. Highly recommend the crispy Brussel sprouts, popcorn shrimp tempura, filet mignon wrapped asparagus, crunchy tuna and the spicy scallops.

For dessert do order the green tea tiramisu.

Drinks : We just did beer and wine and they have a good selection.

All in all a wonderful dining experience. Definitely a classy and EXPENSIVE restaurant - that's quiet normal for the strip, but it's worth the money you spend."}
{"text":"Stay away.
For being moderately expensive I was expecting good sushi but all that came was mediocre one."}
{"text":"The happy hour deal is great! Had the spicy tuna and spicy scallop roll - both were excellent. The service was also fantastic."}
{"text":"Not impressed for the price. Informative and nice wait staff. However they served us the wrong dish, which we starting eating before realizing it was not what we ordered, only to be told later when the bill was delivered we had to pay for the sushi they incorrectly delivered. Sushi was just ok...not worth the cost."}
{"text":"Went to Sushi Roku tonight with my family from CT and had a great experience.  We had Rene as our server and he was fantastic.  He knew the menu, was able to answer all questions regarding gluten free and vegan items, made great suggestions for the dietary restrictions and got everything right!  There were 13 of us yelling out food orders for rolls and appetizers and nothing was missed.  Our drinks were promptly refilled, table pre-bussed, set up nicely for dessert and everything was absolutely delicious!  Sushi Roku doesn't fall short in any regard...great ambiance, upbeat music, good energy, superior service and amazing food.    You can certainly tell that the management is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Not much to say. It's sushi in Vegas and it is damn good. Pricey but that is to be expected. Definitely added to my list of places to eat when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I recently spent the better part of a week at the W Hotel in Scottsdale.  Of course I picked the coldest few days seen in recent years in Phoenix!

Very happy to find that the \"hotel restaurant\" was Sushi Roku!  I'd been there once before in LA.

Some highlights....

-- very creative, out of the box options
-- extremely knowledgable wait team
-- impeccable service


A few of my favorites that our group enjoyed....

1.  Black Truffle Tempura Handroll 
2. Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus
3.  The triple desert sampler (chocolate \"lava\" cake was awesome!\"

While it wasn't cheap -- it was well worth the cost.  I knew it was pricey when I walked in, but the amazing menu, outstanding wait staff, and quality make you forget about the price!"}
{"text":"Brought to you by the group that includes Katana and BOA, Sushi Roku is upscale chain restaurant found in the Forum Shops at Caesers. 

Best sushi in town (at this time). I always let my friend order for me here, so most of the time it's always too much food. Haru, my favorite Itamae, always makes consistent, beautiful dishes. Different items tried:

Ika somen with gold flakes
Kimo
Mackerel
Hamachi
Tuna Sashimi Carpaccio
Salmon Sashimi Carpaccio
Monkfish Liver
Tako
Tuna Belly
Bonito (one of my favorites)
Caviar
Yellowtail with Foie Gras and Black Truffle (another favorite)
Matsutake Mushrooms on the Bincho Tan

Polish this all of with a nice sake."}
{"text":"While the view alone might be reason enough to dine here, I would recommend just having drinks and enjoying the vista because the food here is not good.  It's expensive, yes, but most things on the strip in Las Vegas are.  If it were expensive and quality it would be well worth it, but it is expensive and lacks quality."}
{"text":"Even better than the LA location. The sushi is good, not mind blowing, amazingly fresh, OMG....but a solid good. So you get an enjoyable meal, with an intimate dining experience, and great ambiance. Good views of the strip and a little bit of a breather from the chaos. But what made it a fantastic night was the service. It was EXCELLENT. Best restaurant experience we had the entire trip! I will go back next time I'm in Vegas which I hope will be soon!"}
{"text":"I'm picky when it comes to my sushi. I went to Sushi Roku for the first time last week and I was blown away. The food is SO fresh and the rolls were unique and delicious! The prices are average for the strip, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Dinner was awesome! Very nice, clean and trendy restaurant. We had the toro roll, crab dynamite, baked crab hand roll and special roll all were outstanding! Can't go wrong with any of their rolls."}
{"text":"Best filet mignon I have ever had. Like butter baby. 
Teriyaki flavored steak and mashed potatoes at a sushi restaurant in Vegas?  Sweet baby Jesus that was so damn good."}
{"text":"sushi was just ok, way over priced.  Service was slow for the amount of customers in this place."}
{"text":"Great food - we had a couple of rolls, miso and some amazing seabass skewers. Service was fabulous. We are at 8 on a Friday and there was NO wait. Perhaps people don't know you can go out the doors in Ceasear's by FIZZ and walk down the driveway for a 2 min walk to sushi Roku instead of wandering through the mall for a 10 min walk! We did the meandering walk back but when we were hungry the fast walk was better!"}
{"text":"The five stars is for their service and their sake, the sushi isn't the best I've ever had, but the ambiance at this location is intimate, inviting and sexy.
 A very open concept with the sushi bar being at the center of the restaurant. the lighting of the restaurant focuses on the sushi bar itself,highlighting the chefs as they create beautifully plated dishes.
We love the Sunday and Monday offer of 1/2 off all sake bottles! Some of the finest selections can be found on their menu. 
The manager sat with us and even provided tastings of some of his favorites all because I asked, \" what is the real difference between...\" 
in turn, I received a full lesson and explanation of the polished rice process. LOVED that! 
A 5 star \" as good as it gets sake bar\" experience for Sushi Roku"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing, I went with a party of 9 for my sister's birthday this last Saturday. Everything was going wonderful until a food runner was grabbing plates and spilled sauce all over my hair. I made it very clear that he spilled sauce on my hair, chest and shoulder he apologized and tried to wipe me down with what smelt like a dirty napkin. I told him it was okay and that I was going to the restroom, he then told me he would bring me a wet rag. In the restroom my attempt to rid my hair of the soy sauce was a complete failure. I returned to the table expecting a wet napkin of some sort that may work better than the wet paper towels but the gentleman was no where to be found, and never returned to check on me. I normally would of gone home showered and shrugged it off, but it was my sister birthday and I had to troop along the entire night (4 hours) in misery, smelling like thick, goopy, sticky, soy sauce. 
Thank you so much for a wonderful experience at Sushi Roku

(oh he also spilled sauce on my friends hair so not only did he spill sauce on my hair and I made it known he continued to not be careful and spill more on my friend!!!)"}
{"text":"This place has a great mix of fresh sushi and cooked options! Located in the W hotel, it has a great date night or happy hour atmosphere and the staff was extremely attentive and friendly. We ordered the Katana and baked Lobster roll along with the wagu gyoza and loved everything! They also had a great selection of mixed cocktails and we both enjoyed our selections."}

{"text":"Boring and bland, it all tasted the same and at a premium price point I expected better. A
Slow lazy service."}
{"text":"I really am giving this place 3.5 stars for two reasons.  The noise level and the lack of server loyalty to our table.  Atlhough that's not necessarily a bad thing, it was a bit confusing.  I'll get to that shortly.  We arrived just a few minutes after our reservation, but that's because we got dropped off by the cab on the wrong side and had to hike to the other side where the shops were to get to the restaurant.  When we arrived we were seated promptly.  We were placed in a nice two top right against the window overlooking The Strip.  Really nice view.  However, although were so close to each other, it seemed difficult to have a normal conversation.  The music was a little loud, which in turn had the patrons talking louder, and the two tops are so close together, we were having to talk over each other tables conversations.  I'm sure they felt the same way.
This is where I get to the lack of server loyalty.  We had someone greet our table almost immediately.  He offered us menus and water and said a server would be over shortly.  He even put in an order of edamame for us.  Server #1.  Our edamame came out almost immediately, brought to us by what I assume was a runner.  Person #2.  The server came over to take our drink orders. Server #3.  This was also the same person that took our food order.  The previous runner brought out our first round of sushi.  The sushi was delicious.  We had a couple rolls and the Chef's Sushi sampler.  The tuna and salmon we had was like butter.  Definitely high quality.
When we were finished with our first round, a server asked us if we wanted anything additional.  This was a different server from our initial one.  Server #4.  We said we weren't sure and asked for another menu.  Once we decided, we had Server #5 come take our final order.  He also brought us our last roll, and brought us our check.  When we got the check, I was confused as to who would be getting our tip due to the number of people that served us.  While I certainly appreciated the constant attention, I wanted to make sure that the tip was given appropriately.  I tipped 20% as I do normally and hopefully the servers receive their tips appropriately, however that may be.  Not once did we ever see Server #1 again.
All in all, I would probably return here again.  Maybe not on my next visit, but at some point."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!!!   We were staying a Nobu, a boutique hotel in Caesar's.  We just arrived in Vegas and were looking for a nice place to sit, relax and enjoy a satisfying meal.

We happened upon Sushi Roku and decided to give it a try.  We had a window view of the strip.  Not only that but the food was fantastic as well as the service.  I'm a vegetarian and was there with two co-workers who were not.   The waiter was very helpuful at answering my questions about the dishes.  I ordered a couple of appetizers because that's about all there was that was veg. The waiter was great about letting me know that we could start out with just a couple of the small dishes (salad & an eggplant dish),   He said if they were not sufficient he'd put in an orer for an additional dish.  That really impressed me. Often when I order veggie dishes the waiters will act like they think I'll be starving.  Not here!!  And my meal was more than sufficient.  And oooooh, so good!! The Miso Eggplant appetizer was especially delish.  

I'm so glad we decided to take the chance and stop here."}
{"text":"Love this place best rice in the world  and I've been to Japan. The prices are higher but if you love real high end fish this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I heart Sushi Roku.

Atmosphere, Food, Service - this place as it all.

Despite being located in an upscale section of a \"mall - \"Forum at Caesar's Palace, the dark, rich wood, ponds with koi, multi-leveled seating (booths and platforms) and the warm lighting made this place irresistable to not walk into during a break in my shopping frenzy. This place had the hints of a warm romantic restaurant with the modern edge that made dining here accessible to all.  No matter where you are sitting (even if you aren't near a window) you'll enjoy the view.

I was ready for a huge meal and my dining partner and I (having walked from MGM) were ready for a giant meal.

We took the server's suggestion of a Tokyo Breeze (a sake cocktail).  It was amazing!  Perfectly balanced - not-too-sweet citrus cocktail made from sake, to this day, as not found it's equal in ANY establishment i have been to.  It was amazing..

Starter:
Chilean Sea Bass Eggrolls- I think this has forever changed my view on eggrolls.  The buttery flavor of the Chilean Sea bass was perfect with this dish.  The tender fish paired with the crispy wonton skin... amazing.

Sushi:
Uni - Delicious!
Salmon - tAMAZING!
the server mentioned that this was suggested by the chef because I had ordered so much salmon sashimi (it was a special kind - i can't remember, but had thicker bands of the delicious fat and was a more deeply hued orange than what I am used to) 
Eel- (freshwater) it was prefectly sauced with great consistency.

The slices of fish were well matched size-wise with the perfectly seasoned rice

Sashimi:
Salmon, Yellowtail, and Tuna - all were delicious!

Rolls:
The rice was NOT smashed into the nori and the balance of all the flavors were perfectly matched!
We had the Kani Kani roll because we are crab lovers!  A roll done with crab 2 ways - inside (Alaskan snow crab) and outside - fried/tempura!  Delicious.
there was a great selection of rolls that seemed to cover everything from the extremely lavish to the simple but delicious..
TRY them all!


Service was extremely helpful, prompt and polite.  They were very attentive when we needed them and magically disappeared when they were no longer needed.. its that 6th sense that great servers are known for.. Sushi Roku servers had it.


This will be pricer than what you are used to, but it is every bit worth it."}
{"text":"Went here on our anniversary trip. The food was great, same as in Pasadena CA... service was slower and we were ignored or rushed depending on which server kept coming to our table, since we had 2 taking care of our table...

BUt the food was spectacular as always."}
{"text":"Delicious and great atmosphere. Best yellowtail sashimi ever: \"yellowtail diced chiles\"...."}
{"text":"Ambience is nice, great music and decor... Located in the W hotel. Sushi is a bit pricey but very fresh. Menu is confusing and not much explanation is given. Alcoholic beverages are great as well, I ordered only 1 pear martini and it was STRONG!!"}
{"text":"The Sushi Roku empire was built out in Los Angeles, but the trendy vibe was transported across state lines to be featured in their Las Vegas location.  The third floor digs inside the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace provide expansive views of the Strip.  Being only a few flights above ground, you are able to enjoy the towering lights of the hotels, as well as the entertaining antics happening on the busy street.  The dim lighting and Asian-inspired decor make Sushi Roku a seductive spot.  However, the high ceilings and open dining room can get quite loud when full of larger parties.  (Our meal was continuously disrupted by a rowdy birthday celebration.)

Since we were grabbing a late dinner, we decided to opt for some light courses.  I ordered the Mixed Sashimi Salad, which was a mound of fresh field greens topped with radish slices and served over thinly cut raw fish.  The platter included tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and more.  A snappy ginger vinaigrette was drizzled over the dish, providing a gentle spicing.  Each piece of fish was light, fresh, and tender.  I also sampled their Eel Avocado Roll, which contained eel slices so warm that the maki easily fell apart, one of my pet peeves.  My friend ordered the special Katana Roll.  The massive portion contained about 10-12 slices of a mixed spicy tuna and shrimp tempura maki, topped with tuna and yellowtail slices.  It was a fantastic concoction that she reminisced about for days.

Many hip Japanese spots that provide fun atmospheres and innovative cooking styles, such as Nobu, often do not provide the same food quality as more traditional spots.  However, Sushi Roku scores 4 stars on all of points - style, creativity, and taste."}
{"text":"So I really was looking forward to coming back here but it was quite disappointing. I will start by saying they were very quick to help us figure out a seating situation for our group of 8 which was nice. We settled on the patio which may have been the reason for the poor service or the server could have been being over worked however when we could call her name for assistance we were often ignored u til she had time to help. It took a LONG time to get our checks and they won't split them for you. You have to do it. 

The way the food comes out is strange. It was all at different times and so all of us were eating sporadically and not together. The food was average. I am pregnant so I could not have the sushi but my husband said it was good. The atmosphere is definitely what makes the place. Would likely come back for a night out with the girls for drinks and atmosphere and probably skip the restaurant."}
{"text":"I lived in NY for while before I moved here to Scottsdale. Sushi Roku makes me miss NY a little less -- not just b/c of the cool decor and the semi-fancy without being too pretentious ambiance, but b/c the food is really good and the manager and chef are extremely friendly and genuine, which is how they are in NY. I don't go out that much, so when I do, I want it to be a relatively meaningful experience. The food is amazing -- MUST get the popcorn shrimp app which is the most elegant lightly fried shrimp I've ever had. The sushi rolls are great. Try not to get a super young server, there's one I won't name who kind of sucks. Other than that, it's a great experience."}
{"text":"Another favorite of ours in Vegas didn't disappoint us on this trip. 

My wife is not a fan of fish but there is plenty on the menu for her to choose from. 

She chose a cucumber and avocado roll and had them use soy paper instead of seaweed.  And chicken teriyaki, rice, with vegetable tempura. 

I had an assortment of rolls and a friend joined us late but the restaurant accommodated without any problems.  

As others have said there may be better sushi restaurants on the strip but we live the view, food, and service and will be back on our next trip."}
{"text":"Sleek contempary room with good people viewing seats within the Forum shops rotunda.  Very good sushi, very good service, reasonable prices by Vegas standards.  Worth a visit if you are in a sushi mood."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for dinner before a show on Sunday night. It was not busy at all. When we arrived we first sat at the bar to wait for a table. We ordered some saki and a couple apps to start. The happy hour was great! We finally got a table and decided to do the chefs tasting.  The waitress told us it was a good portion and we would be fine each getting one.  Mind you it's $120 each.  When the food started coming out, the portions were insanely large which would have been great if we hadn't already purchased apps.  We ended up stopping at course 5 bc it was just too much and we were very annoyed that the waitress didn't just tell us and instead was just trying to up her sales and we didn't even get to enjoy it.  We don't mind spending the money but the waitress was very dishonest, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"We came for lunch and it was alright. There was no one at the front counter when we walked up and we stood there for about a minute or two looking like a couple of lost souls because we were unsure of the following:
1) Are they open? It looks empty. But there's a waiter walking around and there's sushi chefs behind the sushi bar.
2) Should we just walk in? But I don't know where to go... the sushi bar looks open but I can't tell if we're allowed to seat ourselves.  (Even the waiter who was walking around the sushi bar area, who obviously saw us looking confused didn't greet us...)

We walked in, got maybe ten feet inside before the waiter finally said, \"oh she'll (referring to the missing hostess I assumed) be back... she went somewhere....\" We said okayyy and went back outside to the front, where we waited a few more minutes.

My bf got the bento box with teriyaki chicken and spicy tuna roll while I ordered a vegetable tempura donburi and a shrimp and asparagus roll. There was something strange about the roll I ordered, though, but I couldn't place it... I think it might've been the fact that it had some kind of white sauce that may or may not have been mayo (thankfully, I didn't get sick after lunch that day or the next for that matter!)... the teriyaki chicken was excellent - prob the best I've ever had! The chicken was cooked perfectly - moist,  succulent and flavorful!  And the spicy tuna was also pretty awesome - way better than the roll I chose."}
{"text":"I would have given a higher rating, but after the waiter spilled a pitcher of ice water on two of the guests at our table, in front of a manager, and no one even acknowledged the incident.  (Management and service seem to be the consistent reason for poor reviews.). I just can't imagine why I would recommend anyone come here.

Oh and FYI, I posted the same review on OpenTable and it never was shown.  Apparently they don't post unfavorable reviews for the restaurants they work for.  So if you are looking for an accurate rating, don't trust their system."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku is my go-to for any occasion or none at all. Everything is delicious but my heart belongs to the pork belly. I adore the hostess Juliana. She's always accommodating, poised, and elegant and first impressions last so it's a good thing she's one of the first people to greet you at Sushi Roku. The restaurant is inside of the W hotel so put on your Sunday's best because this is the place to see and be seen!"}
{"text":"This place is very good for Americanized Sushi, we can here for my wifes birthday and although they lost our reservation they got us in anyway. The sushi is very unique and tasty, its usually best to go with whatever is freshest. 
if you haven't been here you will never find it...no kidding."}
{"text":"Such a great experience! My husband and I celebrated our 1 year wedding anniversary.  Because I booked our reservation through yelp they knew it was our anniversary and surprised us with a delicious dessert! Sushi was delicious, service was great, and we'll definitely go back the next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"There is not a single thing we ordered that I wouldn't get seconds of. The list in order of absolute love:

1) Brussels sprout chips (tossed in truffle oil)
2) Shishito peppers
3) unknown name tuna role recommended by the chef with spicy tuna and jalapenos inside and fresh tuna on top - AMAZING
4) Beef rib eye wrapped asparagus
5) Crunchy spicy tuna tempura
6) Avocado Hanabi
7) Roasted Cauliflower

To reinstate, I loved all of it. Granted this list is short on sushi and it's not that we don't love sushi, it's that we LOVE appetizers and couldn't make a single choice. But for those on a budget, you might have to make some choices, and I hope this helps. It was the perfect filling amount for three semi-hungry ladies. 

The vibe of the place is perfect. It's in a hotel, and the only way I would notice was the swim suit wearing ladies at the bar. But that's not a bother to me as the waitstaff is incredibly friendly and professional. Note, the night we were there it was mostly a young, handsome, male staff. I'm not complaining just noticing. 

Next time I'm in a city with Roku, I'm coming back."}
{"text":"What a great place for Sushi!  Located in the Cesar, the locals we were staying with pointed this out as a great place with an excellent \"Happy Hour\".  We decided to give it a try and to my surprise they had an excellent selection of rolls decently priced from 4-6pm!  As well, they had some drink specials too.   A couple nice large Sapporo for $5 for me and wine for the other guests and about 6 rolls and a couple appetizers for us to split, all for just about $60 was a great deal!

Check them out for the happy hour, it is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Great sushi & atmosphere. First time here with a group of girls, we arrived around 8 PM on Sat night and there was no wait but the place was pretty busy. Our waiter CJ was so nice & attentive. Wine was $10-16 a glass, I got a cab for $12 & it was good. We got an array of sushi for the table, all was great. The roasted cauliflower is to die for!!!!! The only weird thing was I got the baked crab roll and it wasn't sliced, it was just one long sushi roll, sort of awkward, especially because we just had chopsticks & no knife or anything. But food was great! Will be back."}
{"text":"I let my non-Yelping brother-in-law select where we would have dinner on his final night in Las Vegas, and his choice, Sushi Roku, did not disappoint. He doesn't eat sushi but his lady and I both love it, and we all left Sushi Roku very happy with our meals.

Sushi Roku is located on the third floor of The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, almost directly above the valet (so really easy to find). The space is sleek and sexy, and we had a great view of the Strip from our booth. Service was excellent all night;  patient (we are a chatty group and I think our waiter must have come back to take our order 5 times before we decided on anything) accommodating to special requests and able to answer the plethora of questions we had about the menu. 

Highlights from our meal would be: 

Brussel Sprout Chips with truffle oil - addictively delicious 
Spicy Pork Belly Fried Rice - My brother in law was so in love with this dish he had the waiter bring out another order before he was even halfway finished. He was kind enough to share the pork belly which was absolutely divine. 
American Wagyu Beef Skewer - The pork belly stole the spotlight, but this skewer was a close second. Melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. 
Albacore Sashimi - Super fresh and served with a nice, light ponzu sauce

I didn't see the check so I can not tell you what our meal set us back, but based on how happily my brother-in-law paid it, our meal was obviously worth every penny to him and that's all that really matters to me. I will absolutely return to Sushi Roku in the future,"}
{"text":"Loved every thing on the menu. The miss soup is the best I have ever had. I had their specialty roll with spicy tuna and jalapeño (it's not on the menu but you can ask for it) the pork belly fried rice is unbelievable and I'm not usually a fan of fried rice. I would definitely recommend this resturaunt and come back."}
{"text":"YUM. I went recently and was very happy with not only the food, but the service. My water glass was never empty, and they often came by to check on us. 

The food: I had the Yellowtail Sashimi appetizer with diced chilies. For an appetizer, $17 is a bit high--the portions were a bit small, but this was so delicious. The chilies did not seem spicy to me /at all/ but the whole thing was really flavorful. I could have easily eaten a pound of this. 

I got a few sashimi pieces (maguro, hamachi), and the crunchy spicy tuna roll. Yes, I evidently love tuna. At any rate, these were all really delicious and I was totally happy with my selections. 

The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, and its location inside the forum shoppes is convenient. 

Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Made a reservation for 8:30pm & our party wasn't seated until 9pm...then we were held hostage unable to pay due to a system crash....the service was slow & the food was mediocre. The Chilean Sea Bass was over cooked & the desserts inedible."}
{"text":"I would give it 10 stars if I could. The service was outstanding and the food was off the charts. We had the Brussel sprout chips and tempura vegetables for an appetizers. The chips were amazing. The baked lobster roll was to die for. I might eat here again tomorrow."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed the generous happy hour here. Out favorites were the spicy yellow tail, the filet mignon wrapped asparagus and the albacore sashimi with garlic aioli. The bar staff was fun and friendly. We will return!"}
{"text":"YUMMMMM. Try the KEN Saki! They have delicious roasted cauliflower and really amazing crispy Brussels sprouts! The sushi is always good!!!!! I love going here when I haven friends or family come from out of town!"}
{"text":"Most pleasant dinner in Vegas. Great happy hour with very friendly staff. Owner made a point to check in on all guests. 

Only tried the happy hour menu but thought all the food was fanatic, especially for the price. 

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Yellowtail sashimi w/ diced chiles is amazing but if you want to be in heaven, try the specials, they were like a party in my mouth. The sashimi was fresh and tasty, including the uni, so you know it was amazing. The restaurant was beautiful with a great view of the Strip. The managers were very gracious and knowing we had a show to catch, ordered us the chocolate cake for dessert. Plus the sake list was great and we were able to enjoy an excellent Daiginjo-shu. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Wonderful service , good atmosphere and delicious food. My all time favorite was the tuna carpaccio and blue fin tuna sashimi. Ordered the poke tuna and ribeye steak, both could be good also but the sauce was a bit salty. Overall, everything was perfect. FYI: was celebrating our 3 years being engaged. Definitely will be back ;)"}
{"text":"Great sushi at a reasonable price for Vegas.  Fun staff with big smiles.  Excellent fish.  All purchased directly from Japan."}
{"text":"Never a dull moment eating here. The Filet/ Wagyu wrapped asparagus is a must try, served on a hot rock table side where the sauce is poured at the table presenting a cool little show. Some of my other favorites are the Hamachi green chillies and just simply a chef's selection sashimi plate."}
{"text":"Another great dinner in Vegas. Craving something lighter than the Italian fare that every restaurant seems to have, we opted to walk to this restaurant in Caesars Palace. The atmosphere and food were good. We ordered dishes to share including a veggie roll, miso eggplant dengaku, and roasted cauliflower. 

We liked everything but the tofu three ways. It's just three blocks of cold tofu, with different soy sauces and toppings. We ordered it without the caviar, but neither of us liked the truffle or kimchi one. This could just be us being picky eaters, but I didn't like that we left 95% of it untouched and the waitress didn't ask what was wrong; she just cleared the plate.

All in all, a nice pre-drinking dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my boss. It was alright. Very American catered sushi. Fish freshness was average.

Spicy scallop handroll (3/5) too much mayo and meh...

Salmon skin handroll (4/5) it was crispy as should be

We had a cooked roll (2/5) it was alright hence why I cant remember the name

Hamachi nigiri (3/5) not as fresh as I liked."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice and I hate it.  I can't believe that this place is so popular.  The sushi was AWFUL.  I hope that I didn't contract parasites from the tuna.  The service here is DREADFUL and the scene is HORRIBLE.  
Stick with Wasabi on Sahara...it's the best in the world."}
{"text":"I'm mainly giving this restaurant 4 stars for its awesome view of the strip and hip interior.  Medium to high noise level.  Me and my friend had miso soup, edamame, beer, the \"Hanabi\" spicy tuna on rice cakes appetizer and shared the Katana Roll.  My desert was the most memorable part of the meal.  I got the flambe fruit desert.  Mixed sauteed fruit, served in a crisp pastry shell with vanilla ice cream.  Very good.  Everything else was fresh and good, however, I feel it was rather pricey for the amount of food that we had.   You probably pay for the view."}
{"text":"First time at a sushi restaurant.  It was great.  I did not try the sushi. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"While shopping in the Forum we happened to go up to the 3rd floor and found Sushi Roku.  Both times I have been here has been in between lunch and dinner, so it has been quiet and practically have the place to ourselves.

Service has always been fast, friendly and thorough.  Everything I have had here has been amazing.  One of my favorite things is their kimchee cucumber appetizer.  This is the best \"pickle\" I have ever had. This is so delicious and it takes them 4 days to make it and it is worth it!!!

Two other of my favs are the Unagi and the Korean Pork Belly Fried Rice.  Unagi is cooked perfectly and is so delicate it melts in your mouth.  The Pork Belly Fried Rice is not only a beautiful dish to look at, but it tastes amazing.  There is a good sized portion of pork belly and the poached egg is really the cherry on the top.

For you Saki drinkers, they have an extensive list to choose from.  This has become a must visit restaurant every time I'm in Vegas.  Definitely worth finding the elusive 3rd floor in the Forum Shopping Mall"}
{"text":"Love the food here unfortunately cant say the same about the service specially if you end up at the bar for hh. Avoid at all costs the female server at the bar area that is tall, asian looking, should i say more? The nice young blonde girl thats behind the bar usually is covering the other girl's lack of service and miserable attitude. When i see that the tall one will be my server i just ask to be moved to a restaurant table and if all booked, i just go another place to eat and drink. For that reason only 2 stars, service is the mist important thing specially if you are spending  $100 for food and drinks. Get rid of that horrible server that is killing the bar and make everyone happy."}
{"text":"We ordered the Japanese peppers--so great!!! I could've ate the whole thing!! We had a number of rolls that were all good, but my favorite would have to be the spicy tuna roll. One of the rolls that was ordered wasn't favorable so the management made it up with additional rolls. Awesome location in the W and close to great night spots in downtown Scottsdale. Will return!!"}
{"text":"I want to give this place 3.5 stars. Please note that my Yelp rating is higher because I round up for my reviews. This place is probably the better sushi places in the phoenix area. The atmosphere is very romantic. The lights are dimmed yet there is enough light fixtures to set the mood. It's a sophisticated environment. This is the effect place for a romantic date night, a first date or a night out with the girlfriends. 

I will have to say that as far as the food it's not that great compared to sushi places in Washington DC or New York. However, considering this area (phoenix or for that matter Arizona) it's good sushi. It's very westernized and not truly a Japanese style sushi restaurant. So don't expect too much. A lot of people thinking they are eating authentic style sushi in the restaurant... (that's a different rant for a different time and place...) 

They offer a great listing for cocktails! My favorite was their lychee drink. Their sake is on point too. With that being said, on the weekends, this place is packed with people drinking. There are a lot of drunk people eating dinner. It gets pretty loud and hectic..."}
{"text":"Now Sushi ROKU.. I do like. 

It is located in a even pricier area of Caesars Palace.... on the 3rd floor. Views from up there are cool.. prices @ Roku are also a  bit high as a result.. but go for the Happy Hour! As of the last time I went.. all beer and liquor was very cheap and most of the Hour items were about $5. Good Food too.. I always sit at the bar, and always get great service."}
{"text":"Tasty sushi (though not mind blowing), friendly staff, great atmosphere. We sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chef next to us was fantastic - memorizing all our orders while he was completing 3 other orders was no big deal for him, even the waitress couldn't keep up with him! Spicy tuna cut roll was just okay, along with the Hirame nigiri sushi. But what blew my mind was the hotate nigiri sushi. It was so fresh and melted in my mouth! Suitable place for a date or with groups."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi, lively atmosphere and attentive wait staff.  I came here with my boyfriend last week and we had some of the best sushi in Arizona thus far.  The spicy tuna roll was our fave! The atmosphere was really comfortable and the music was well-fitting for the over all ambiance.  Our server, Clayton was very attentive, helpful and had an outgoing personality.  Will definitely return and ask to be seated with him again!"}
{"text":"Came as we had a ramen craving in Vegas, and it was the closest to our hotel at the Mirage. It's pretty swanky located within the shops at Caesers. Service was really good, and we got a popcorn shrimp roll and 2 bowls of ramen. It was a bit pricey for both, but expected. The roll was simple and tasted good. The ramen, the broth was a tad heavy, noodles weren't chewy, but overall, it wasn't bad. It hit the spot for what it was worth, but obviously for the $, you can get better at a hole in the wall. Great view of the strip, so good if you're looking to spend some moola for sushi."}
{"text":"Yum, nice ambiance , Dan is the best really makes sure your visit is right. I come here often. Logan is the greatest , very attentive . Friendly."}
{"text":"Made a reservation the day of without any problems. Had to wait just a few minutes, but gave us some time to get some drinks, which were quite good. Food-wise, we split the kobe beef cooked on a hot stone and then shared a bunch of rolls as well as some sake. No complaints from anybody about the food, but the only issue we had was our i'm-better-than-you waiter who served us. Definitely talked down to us and tried to make us order the more expensive sake, the more expensive rolls, and another appetizer of the already expensive kobe beef. But even the annoying waiter couldn't keep us from enjoying our food and the restaurant.

For the four of us that ate there, the bill came to about $250. Luckily we were there for work, so it wasn't actually our money we were spending. Might not have enjoyed the place as much otherwise.


The table next to us had a man in his late-60s or early 70s flanked by two busty girls in their late-20s or early-30s. We tried to figure that relationship out. Ah, Vegas."}
{"text":"This was great!  Sea bass sliders, rib eye wrapped asparagus, and lamb chimichuri define the label of Japanese fusion.  Service was wonderful and a well earned 20%.  Ask for Juliana.
So here it comes.

Al says; You gotta eat here."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Loved the ambiance - romantic, inviting, fancy. Soup was good, we enjoyed the food, edamame with chili garlic was yum. The rolls were delicious, a tiny bit overpriced for what it was - that's my only complaint. For the portions and menu variety and quality, it was just a bit overpriced in my opinion (i am an avid sushi eater). I still highly recommend it either way. Our service was outstanding, our water never reached the half level, it was constantly tended to."}
{"text":"My fiance and I decided to wait for our anniversary dinner until we visited Las Vegas and we decided to give Sushi Roku a try. Man, am I glad I did!

I called to place the reservation and they asked if we were celebrating anything. I gave them a cursory answer about a late anniversary not expecting anything and locked in a later reservation.

We arrived and were seated immediately and they had no problem with a request for a view of the strip while we ate. The restaurant is quite and the ambiance was great. It was darker so you had more of an illusion of being alone and the server was extremely attentive!

My fiance ordered the Pork Belly Fried Rice and was smitten from her first bite. She didn't have to add any soy, a first for her! She loved ever bit and it was still good when we ate our leftovers almost 3 hours later, cold.

I had the \"Chef's Choice\" sushi platter. 8 pieces of finely crafted sushi, all with their own signature sauces. Eat bite was unctuous, delectable, and so satisfying! I couldn't remember them all, but the Uni, the Scottish Salmon & the King Crab leg were to die for!

At the end of the meal the wait staff surprised us with a complimentary chocolate lava cake that was the highlight of the meal. They even wrote Happy Anniversary on the plate, a special treat that showed they really paid attention to their customers!

We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great spot for sushi in old town!  We have been there dozens of times and each time the food and service is on point.  The management is great there as well and if it's your birthday the hook up the desserts.  The yellowtail with diced chilis and ponzu sauce, steak wrapped asparagus and popcorn shrimp with miso sauce are our go to apps.  As for main courses there are too many to choose, but you can't go wrong with the sushi rolls and the jalapeño and sriracha rolls with tuna are amazing.  And for dessert you have to go with the assorted mochi ice cream. The best flavors are pistachio (when available), passion fruit, mango, and blueberry.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Organized a dinner for 13 of us here. The private room, the attentive service from Miko and the amazing food selection, made for a great night. The atmosphere and view sent the night over the top. The robata skewers of sea bass and Kobe beef were enjoyed by all. The roasted peppers and tempura shrimp were a hit as well. The sliced tuna was amazing and converted two more to sushi."}
{"text":"Best experience as a business traveler getting tons of attention from the sushi chefs and managers. I love it there and can't wait to try all the concepts in LA."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. There was literally no one in the restaurant. We were sat in a giant booth for 6, just the two of us, it was very comfortable. We got water right away and our waiter was super nice. The only thing I liked about this visit was the waiter. He was helpful and friendly. 
The water had a horrible aftertaste to it and the people that came in after us noticed it too. If there is a problem with the water, dont serve it. The food was just ok. The kicker is when we got our bill for $60! It was lunch! Highly overpriced for the product. Probably won't go back again, but hey, we tried it. 
I also want to add I am a vegetarian and the only vegetarian item on the menu was vegetable tempura for $11. It was mostly broccoli which I don't like. I ate maybe 3 pieces. The bento boxes offered for lunch don't have anything that I could eat."}
{"text":"My friend and I hopped over to Sushi Roku for our last meal in Vegas on the recommendation of her family. Her family is Japanese and said that they experienced some great sushi here. You can't go wrong with that type of recommendation, right?!

RIGHT! This place was spot on. Everything from our edmame, spicy crunchy tuna rolls, and chefs sashimi plate was excellent. The fish just melts in your mouth and the rice was the perfect consistency. 

This place isn't cheap, but either is the food quality. Great way to end our stay in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Why come here to eat? We just spent $130.00 and going home hungry. On top of it we found a long piece of plastic in our rice but they said it was crab. For this price they should make sure no UFOs are found in our food. Overpriced and not so good food. Very small portions, I mean small."}
{"text":"Nice looking place.  The server was an AZZ.  I don't know if it was because our party of 6 included 2 kids or maybe he didn't like my shoes...  I dont know.  Everyone in our party just got the feeling that we were bothering \"Gregory\".   There was only 3 other people in the restaurant at 4:30 pm so I have no idea what the problem was.  Check my reviews...  I am not the negative rating yelper that only rates poor service.  This guy made us all just want to leave."}
{"text":"Eating here now. Excellent food, Juliet is awesome! Glad we came. Will stop here again on our next trips. The shrimp appetizer is huge. The Katana roll is delish."}
{"text":"Best place in Scottsdale to get sushi , great service, Jennah made our experience personal and had such a great attitude, I'm definitely going back and telling all my friends"}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Katana roll is where it's at.  They even gave my wife a set of chopstick helpers to help the struggle. Haha"}
{"text":"I've always felt there are two items that are consistent indicators of the overall quality of a sushi restaurant... saba or uni. I took the saba test and Sushi Roku got low marks. The fishier the saba generally the less awesome your sushi meal will be and sure enough, my saba was pretty fishy and the overall meal was edible, but not stellar. 

Granted I was eating sushi in landlocked Scottsdale, so perhaps the joke is on me. Alas I was tired from my travels and was in desperate need of food, so I can't say I thought about my dining decision before going in. 

The interior is pretty sleek (as is the decor of the whole hotel) so I'd say it'd still be a fun spot for a date. Our server was pretty cool too. 

Final word: If you're staying in the hotel, don't feel like branching out, and have no price sensitivity, it's fine."}
{"text":"If there was a rating system for price, I'd give this place a 2 but being that every restaurant on the strip and in a hotel is expensive, I'll just level the playing field and ignore the price. In terms of the food and atmosphere, it was great! For an appetizer we ordered the edamame hummus which came with chips (although not enough and when we asked for just a few more chips, when we got the bill they charged us $3 for extra chips - not cool - you should tell us there is going to be a charge first). We also ordered the cod and the spider roll - both extremely good! I guess if we had gotten there just an hour earlier we could have gotten the same thing for half price - but oh well, good to know for next time!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to the locations back home but I was pleased with my Sunday afternoon lunch here.  Nice decor, including the restrooms.  I had a $17 lunch combination (teriyaki chicken and tempura) which comes with rice and miso soup.  The tempura was tasty.  For you chocoholics, the volcano cake is to die for.  It's really yummy with the vanilla bean ice cream and strawberries."}
{"text":"I agree with others. My wife and I came here for a quick and quiet anniversary dinner. Although it was not the least bit quiet as a result of Karaoke (sp) night at the club across the way, it was pretty quick. We had a very good rainbow roll, some nice hamachi, etc. The fish was very fresh and delicious. The rolls were a good size and not too over-priced. We thought it would have been even more expensive considering the atmosphere, but it was a pretty good price. I would go back to this place because it is conveniently located on the walkway that connects the Forum Shops to Caesars and was actually not far from the elevator to our room. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will likely be back as soon as I can get back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku has the most amazing service.  We sat at the sushi bar and Toby was fantastic.  Our server Kenji was quite attentive.  Special kudos go to the manager Fan.  He did a fantastic job helping go through the saki menu and explaining everything.  They all knew the menu so well.  Truly an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the best sushi we've ever had- rivaled only by one special dinner in NYC. An amazing experience of flavor, service and ambiance.

The main restaurant has nice ambiance but a very \"club\" feel with loud music so we asked to sit out on the patio where we could hear each other talk. Giovanni was our server and he quickly suggested that given some \"guidelines\" he'd be happy to select our dishes - a surprise for each dish, and pushing us out of our standard \"Philadelphia roll\" boredom. We said yes, and were then treated over the next three hours to a set of masterpieces from Brussel sprout flakes to fluke quat to oh toro to tuna tartar and more, finishing with a flourish of zen smores for desert. Each dish was presented by Giovanni with nuanced descriptions and clear love of Japanese food. The flavor of each dish built in the one before, was multi-layered and delicate- we were laughing with amazement at how many ways by the end we had eaten truffles, for example.

A masterful evening, and we plan to come again soon for sake tasting. Fantastic restaurant!"}
{"text":"The customer service we got here was incredible! Came during happy hour on a slower day and the staff took the time to explain the full menus as well answer my boyfriends 100 questions about it ( we had never been here before) and all of the food was delicious! I would especially recommend the avocado hanabi!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I can unbiasedly review Sushi Roku because we went there straight after a big win at the tables, so we were really excited and a little tipsy. :)

The truffle roll was unique and delicious...it was my favorite one.  We also got the tempura crab roll (good, not amazing) and something with unagi and avocado (may have been a dragon roll?).  We only had a few rolls and then were pretty hungry later that night, so next time we'd order more.  But we were in a hurry to catch our flight later and couldn't spend a lot of time.

The service was great..I don't remember our server's name, but she was great.  We also chatted with the sushi chef as he was making his creations.

It was pretty expensive, especially because we didn't fill up on the food.  I think for what seemed like 3-4 rolls plus 2 sakes it was like $85!  Kind of crazy.  But it was good quality and good service...so I thought it was worth it this time.  Or maybe I was just feeling rich. ;)

We would go back just to see what else they have on the menu and to spend a little longer relaxing with our meals.

It's so hard to decide where to go in Vegas because there are SO many options - but I'd say this is a nice spot for a date and a pretty good experience overall."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place wasn't packed out. The sushi was amazing. We got the 8 piece chefs choice and he hooked us up! Sea urchin, salmon, yellowtail, eel and more. All delicious with unique garnishments. We also got the Kobe beef potstickers which were abolsolutly divine and filled with beef, not just a little beef and a lot of fillers. And lastly don't sleep on the cold ramen appetizer because that dish was my favorite of the whole weekend in Vegas and I will go back just to eat it. Service was fantastic too. Manager came around and checked on us."}
{"text":"Typical high end Vegas restaurant which in no way is a bad thing. Fantastic atmosphere, very interesting decor, our waitress was very knowledgeable and attentive. Service overall very good. The food was prepared and presented extremely well. Everything we ordered we thought was excellent. We had a couple different types of spicy rolls along with some yellow tail tuna sashimi which was incredible. We also had some raw kobe beef, yakatori and some tempura seafood which was also fantastic. Even the little bowl of miso soup I had was exceptional. We sat right at the windows with an incredible view of the strip. You will pay the price for this level of quality and surroundings but as a special occasion sushi place, I would certainly go again. Was a great place for a special date night."}
{"text":"Pretty average sushi nothing too special. The restaurant was pretty empty on Wednesday night. We ordered multiple roles the best role what's a spicy tuna the little piece of jalapeno on top of each roll. I've had a lot better sushi at better prices but I guess this is what you can expect in Vegas. At least I can say the fish tasted fresh"}
{"text":"Good space and atmosphere. The happy hour is an awesome deal with lots of rolls and appetizers, beer and sake on special. 

Would recommend the \"hanagi\" (sp) spicy tuna roll. It's deep fried rice with the spicy tuna and sauce on top. Our server told us the restaurant won an award for it. 

Only reason it's 4 out of 5 stars is they don't always read reservation notes, it was my finances birthday and they didn't acknowledge it."}
{"text":"Day one in Vegas and we stumbled on Sushi Roku.  We tried 4 different rolls and had the Gyoza. Everything was amazing. You will wait quite a while for service but it is so worth it. Skip the California roll."}
{"text":"Was recently there for a friends birthday party.  The portions were very small and expensive.  I order the grill chicken as the entre, Lets just say as an avid griller theirs was no comparison to mine, There was no taste to it had no spices or anything, they grilled aplain piece of chicken and covered it in cheap teriyaki sauce, as for the mashed potatos they were plain too, seemed to be fake potatos not real ones no flavor or spices, they also had grilled asperagus on the plate too, also plain no flavor.. To top it all off I was forced to pay 20% gratuity for avaerage service."}
{"text":"We went for their HH deal. It was 3 of us, we were seated right away. Only the bar/lounge area is available for happy hour. 

Their price seemed very reasonable when looking at the menu, but when we got the actual food, we were somewhat disappointed with their portion. They literally provide sample portions of their actual food at somewhat reduced price. I do not recommend any roles, as I thought they were like AYCE sushi quality. Very small 6 pieces of roles for 6-8 dollars. I don't know how much they would actually charge for the same role during non-HH price- so go ahead if you want to risk it. 

Also, their fried calamari was very oily and sweet level was to the max. Their wagyu wrapped asparagus was very good, but again, only 4 pieces of half asparagus were offeres. Their drinks are \"hotel\" HH price. 

The one thing that I would definitely go back for is their MUSHROOM TEMPURA!! That was the best fried shitakes ever. They were deep fried softly with an essense of truffle oil. So good that I can still smell it! 

Their service is just average, nothing stands out. I would recommend places lime sushi Ra or other local places if anyone is craving sushi for HH prices and is looking at this place."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night with a huge group. They accommodated us very well. We had reservations at 8:30 and were seated immediately. The service was great, our server was on top of everything. The sushi was delicious and it is obviously pricey because you're paying for grade A quality fish. Appetizers were great, especially the peppers. Serving sizes were fairly small but it is expected. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Have had why better sushi at a handful of places. I guess by it being in the lobby area helps with the rating of this place. $12 for 4 slices of octopus is way over priced by about $4. The place does look nice thats for sure. Would not go back unless I'm suffering from toxic silicon sickness from all the silicon in the swimming pool upstairs"}
{"text":"Happy UPDATE!!

So I'm happy to report, I've been back two times since this first review.
I must have been there on a bum night the first time, but overall, I like this place. 

The Miso Soup is delish, the Tofu-yaki (tofu teppan yaki) was REEEEDICK!!  I get happy thinking about it. And the edamame has pieces of salted-crack sprinkled on them, I don't know what makes theirs soo flippin' good.

But it's pricey and we left a tad hungry.

The ambiance is quite pleasant and modern, the service both times was great!!  I'll go back and I'm happy to RE-review. 

Local Discount 20% off"}
{"text":"Meh. Overrated. Acceptable food, creative rolls and fish, excellent service but the food is, in my humble, \"yet incredibly spoiled for sushi\" opinion, this was just \"OK\". I've eaten sushi & sashimi all over the world and looked forward to trying Roku Scottsdale (we've been to another location and were underwhelmed but thought we'd try again). We were staying at the W and based on their website (silly me!) we thought we'd give it a try (from the W website: \"Voted \"Top 10 Asian Restaurants\" by Arizona Republic, Sushi Roku, our Scottsdale restaurant, pushes the boundaries of modern Asian cuisine with a dazzling array of fresh sushi, luscious salads, thoughtful appetizers, and an extensive selection of hot entrees.:) Top 10 Asian restaurants? Pushes the boundaries??? Dazzling array???? Me thinks not so much....
The yellowtail with diced chilies (aka jalapeno slices) was the best dish we had, I would recommend that. OToro was quite good, the rest? Not memorable (I can't even recall what we had). We had ordered salted edamame as a starter, however, it came out after we finished all of our sashimi and sushi and it was burned, actually inedible. Great 1/2 price Sake deal mid week was a nice touch though. Again, the chefs and the servers were excellent, but I would recommend Kodo Sushi & Sake in No. Scottsdale WAY more."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner since it's located next to the W and seems to always be hidden to me. The atmosphere was amazing. Dim lighting candles lit, very upscale, modern, oriental and there's also outdoors seating. Their food was good and the service was also good. It's a really good date place and to meet people."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Cleanliness: 5/5
Decor & Style: 5/5

The food is definitely good. Nice view of the strip. You can tell it's a pricey place by the way it looks. The place is pretty dark, but that is because they want everyone to notice their huge view of the Strip."}
{"text":"Wasn't a fan of this restaurant. The rolls were just OK. Tuna tataki was great and suprisingly (I am a beef lover) the veggies were great (brussel sprouts, eggplant, etc.). Other than that, nothing was above average. Las Vegas has better restaurants for the same price."}
{"text":"Me and my company really enjoyed our dinner here. The sushi is quality, the service was great, and they willingly catered to our special needs (shellfish allergies, needed to make sure there was no cross contamination). 

We were seated at table with a wonderful view of the strip below us, all in all, very ambient, romantic atmosphere. Fair prices- some of the Japanese restaurants in Vegas can go quite high, but this was fair in terms of good quality and good prices."}
{"text":"Excellent Service, Delicious food and drinks. This past Thursday was the first time I had been to Sushi Roku, definitely will be back the next time we are in Scottsdale. Our bartender/waiter Alex makes incredible drinks and his customer service is terrific. He made the whole dining experience for our table of 7 ladies lots of fun!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Roku offers high quality Japanese sushi and entrees. I was very impressed by the presentation and quality of their food. My favorite dishes were the ribeye and Brussels sprout chips. While dinner was amazing Dessert left more to be desired. They served our bread pudding cold which was a little shocking as this dish is usually served warm."}
{"text":"The great thing about Las Vegas is you can always find a fantastic restaurant. I've had sushi at other places in town but Sushi Roku is by far the best. We made lunch reservations for 2:30 and thank goodness day drinking had not really started because we wandered around the forum shops for 45 minutes just trying to find the 3rd floor. Ok I am a little challenged with reading maps but I'm sure it would have been way longer if I was buzzed. Finally arriving on the third floor we were seated immediately. I ordered the sake sampler...so good!!! And started with the King Crab fried rice, by far the best fried rice we have ever had in our lives. I had the nigiri lunch combo with a spicy tuna roll and my fiancée had the fried tuna rolls. Everything was just exceptional! I will definitely be back for lunch or dinner on my next Vegas trip! Sushi is after all my favorite thing to eat!!"}
{"text":"Had my bday dinner here. I had a spicy tuna octopus roll which was SO good. I love octopus. Also, for dessert they gave me chocolate souffle with a sparkler on top. Love it"}
{"text":"What a great dining experience before making our way to Elton John (it is a quick 5 Minute walk to the theater - ask them for the \"short cut\").  First off kudos to our server as well as GM Johnny who was personable and gave us local love.  Room is awesome - very cool with tall glass windows with view onto the strip.  Every item order was on point.  We were big fans of the jalapeño tuna roll and wagyu dumplings.  Look forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"Best sushi me and my family has ever had. Instantly seated and ate within minutes. Awesome staff."}
{"text":"I love coming to Vegas and trying different sushi places each time.  My roommate picked this place due to its reviews.  We were not disappointed!  Our favorite roll for the evening was the Jalapeño Tuna roll.  The server suggested the roll.  I was nervous about the Jalapeño so she had them make the roll without them.  It was such a mouthful of flavors.  The cilantro set the roll off and I never would have considered that combination but it totally worked.

As far as pricing I was not upset.  We ordered 4 drinks, 3 rolls and a side to share. When the bill came it was $130 before the tip.  Considering this was an on strip restaurant I didn't feel that was a bad price.   I'm sure you can find a cheaper place but the sushi won't be even close in comparison."}
{"text":"We came on a Sat night with reservations. The place was busy. Super busy. They tried to seat us on a wet booth and looked at me like I was crazy when I declined. We waited at the bar for 20 minutes for a table. 

The wait on our order for 6 rolls - was 45 minutes. Just to get one of our rolls. The drinks were served fast- I will give them that. 

We ended up leaving though we weren't full- just to head somewhere else. Food tasted fine. Nothing extraordinary. Service was good. Not her fault. Kitchen was super slow - they did take the rolls off our bill to apologize.

Maybe you will go on a less busy night."}
{"text":"I went to the sushi bar. The sashimi was fresh and the sushi bar chef was nice but not too helpful-- \"everything is fresh.\" The sake list is pretty short. Overall 4 stars especially for the Japanese scallops!  The toro was buttery but expensive. I would eat here again. The service for a slow Monday night was great."}
{"text":"Sushi was good but not as good as Sushi Samba in Venetian mall which was cheaper.  We only ordered basic rolls: eel avocado was best tasting,  shrimp tempura was somewhat disappointing.  Big plus for waiter though, he was very friendly and patient even after it was apparent we were only order a few basic rolls and water."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night. The katana roll was FANTASTIC - my new favorite!! Perfectly made with the perfect ratio of fish and rice. We ordered the lava cake, which was really good, too, but slightly overcooked (crispy edges); the sake bombs helped us to overlook that :)

TIP: Dress to impress on weekends"}
{"text":"My sister and brother-in-law took me here for a late dinner raving about how awesomely good this place is. And I have to say, they did not lie. The dishes here are amazing.
My sister favorite is the sea bass cooked or steamed in some way that is melts in your mouth. Not literally, but the fish meat is very tender and the sauce has a hint of sweetness. Too bad it isn't on the menu anymore as we were told.
We also several sushi rolls and those were good as well.

Service was excellent. Granted it is located in a hotel, so that is sort of expected.
The decor is trendy with a lounge like ambiance. There are actually several locations, so this is definitely a place I need to check out in L.A."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Sushi Roku.  It's not the best, nor the worst experience I've had.  I guess if I had to sum them up in one word, it would be mediocre.

My gf and I went to Sushi Roku on our first day in Vegas.  The two of us have had omakase at some of the best restaurants NYC has to offer.  We've been to Nobu, Nakazawa, Gari, and Akio.  Seeing that Roku offered omakase made us excited as we wanted to add another feather in our cap of excellent sushi, but in truth it was a bit of a dud.

The omakase is six courses, really just three sandwiched between an appetizer and a dessert.  The appetizer was an interesting salad, the dessert was a strawberry shortcake thing that you could likely find at a local diner, and the three sushi courses were more or less forgettable.  I'd like to give you more details, but honestly that's all you need to know.  There was no ah-ha moment were I thought that they had created something special.  I can't honestly say that it was bad though and had we not previously experienced some of the most amazing sushi you could eat, we might have been more impressed.

The one highlight of Roku was the service.  We had a great sushi chef and a great server.  Our server really went the extra mile and gave us some help in finding the perfect place to watch fireworks on the 4th of July.  Additionally, the beer and spirit offerings were great.  I had a fantastic rice beer that I wish I remembered the name.

Go to Sushi Roku, just don't have the omakase.  It's not worth the price.  You'll have a good time though."}
{"text":"My guess it deserves a much higher star rating, except for the terrible service. That is the shame of the industry. As it has such great ambience and I can see where there be a draw but it took me a half hour to get served 10 pieces of sushi.

The waitress she was very sweet I didn't get any alcohol just got water in it was refilled wants the sushi was very good but they were small portions.

I guess since it's in a hotel this is it would be referred to as the touristy place and I don't think I would be returning to have sushi here."}
{"text":"Staff is snobby and unhelpful, place is nice, their sushi was gross and way overpriced for tasting so horrible will never go back"}
{"text":"We LOVED our meal. Sat down immediately at a cozy booth, we had a wonderful and attentive waiter, CJ. We loved his recommendations and his service was impeccable! Definitely ask to be seated in his area and you will sincerely enjoy your meal. The food was scrumptious and the preparations were different than what we have had at other sushi spots across the globe. 

What we ate:
- Eggplant miso: the miso sauce is amazing and the eggplant was so fresh. 
-Albacore sashimi with fried onions: the fried onions add a nice crunch
-Tuna tartare with truffle: literally the best tartare I've ever had, melted in your mouth- and the truffle was very present 
-Beef ribeye wrapped over asparagus- the sweet sauce was finger licking good. 
- Creamy miso popcorn shrimp (replaced with seabass instead of shrimp): thankful that the kitchen was ready to accommodate, also the best creamy Miso sauce. A must order!! 
-Spicy tuna crispy rice (aka hanabi): a generous serving of the spicy tuna on top, and it was served immediately so you had a good mix of the hot rice cake with the colder tuna.
-Tuna Jalapeño roll- super fresh, served with fried onion, and so much tuna!

Finished off with two of their classic melon mix shooters. 

Overall an extremely delicious, and memorable meal. We would definitely recommend coming here and if we return to Scottsdale we would reserve here for sure."}
{"text":"Great ambiance.  They sat us at a two top over by the big window that overlooks the strip.... that combined with the mood lighting(dark) and music, you could really feel the energy of vegas.  The sushi was pretty good too.  Lots of fancy rolls along with the basics.  Got the seaweed salad as an app.  Good portion for 2 people.  It was different because they mixed in some baby green with the seaweed which added a different dimension to the dish.  The best thing we had was the fresh sweet shrimp(amaebi).  A little pricey but worth it.  It was served along with the deep fried heads.  Don't want to disgust anyone but if you been to new orleans, \"pinch the tails, suck the heads\"  Seafood perfection!"}
{"text":"I never tried sushi until visiting here about a year ago.  I'm hooked now.

This place has a few areas to sit.  There's the sushi bar if you want to simply experiment and order as you please.  There's a more cozy seating area near the entrance.  There's also a large area near some huge windows with a great view.

The staff has always been patient and willing to help a sushi-noobie figure out what to order.  I enjoyed sitting at the bar a couple times (I visit Vegas often) and the chefs are almost like bartenders.  They have personality and will talk with seated customers.  

I've tried a number of different dishes (don't ask me to name them).  Before I took the plunge, I had steak and it was well prepared.  I haven't tried anything exotic like eel or squid and kept mainly to the safer meats like tuna and shrimp.  The food has been great.

This restaurant is usually near the top of my list to visit when I simply want to stick with what I know instead of exploring other restaurants."}
{"text":"I can't say it enough. I love Sushi Roku. We came back this past Friday for my girlfriend's 30th. Everyone LOVED it. The food was delicious. The service was prompt. The drinks were tasty (I couldn't resist ordering the Lychee Martini again). The ambiance was incredible. We were an hour early for our reservation and they still sat us with no issue!

Pricing is very reasonable (for dining on the Strip) and the staff was super friendly.

We had the Baked Crab Handroll (yummy), Albacore Tuna sushi (the fish melted in your mouth and the rice didn't fall apart), and the Rock Shrimp Tempura with Jalapeno roll. DIVINE. Everyone scarfed their meal down.

I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner the other night on our trip to Vegas. We're from Southern California so we know good sushi and while this place was absolutely gorgeous inside, I was a little disappointed. I knew it was going to be pricey, but I thought maybe the portions would be a little bigger and the sushi would be more unique. We ordered the jalapeño tuna roll and the scallop roll. The food runner accidentally brought out a roll that we didn't order but he said we could just keep it, so that was a plus! It was good, don't get me wrong, but I've definitely had very similar sushi rolls at numerous restaurants in California. Our server was very nice and our food came out quickly. I would recommend this place for sure, I guess I'm just spoiled when it comes to the sushi places by my house :)"}
{"text":"Sushi Roku will always have a special place in the heart of my wallet. I was in vegas for a bachelor party. Initially my group of 16 was going to eat at Texas de Brazil, but after a couple days of buffets and steaks the guys in my group couldn't handle it anymore. We made last minute reservations at Sushi Roku for a party of 16 on a saturday.

I arrived a bit later but when I did some of the guys were getting hooked up big time at the bar with shots and drinks which was real cool. We were seated after taking some shots and just started ordering an assortment of sushi rolls and king crab fried rice. The king crab fried rice was simple yet so pleasing. It really hit the spot and filled us up quickly. Sushi rolls were all pretty decent. Of course we all partaked in sake bombs. 

The service was off the charts. The waitresses were so accommodating and polite. Upon getting our check they said we could take $400 dollars off. This was absolutely mind blowing. Apparently one of the guys of our party was chopping it up with the General manager unknowingly and complimented the dude on his $1600 dollar armani suit. BAM instant savings son. We all suspect he performed sexual favors to get us the discount. You do what you got to do when you are a team player I guess. I kid I kid.

Anyway the meal was decent, the service was ridiculously good, the restaurant decor was swanky and chill, and the bill for us, vegas standard wise, was an all time winner.

General Manager Johnny. Compliment the guy on his suit *cough*. The dude is an all time legendary great."}
{"text":"Sushi is just sushi but this place takes it to another level.  With the location, view, ambiance and of course THE MANAGER AND STAFF!! They make it worth the experience.  Highly a must do in VEGAS BABY!  Johnny and Gary Thank You! Hope to see u soon."}
{"text":"I have lived here for nine years and this is by far the absolute worst sushi restaurant I have ever eaten at!  Hamachi was 'fishy' and had to be sent back.  GM offered to replace the returned dish with another one and ended up charging us for both.  After we received the bill he was nowhere to be found.  Everything else was just mediocre and way overpriced!  Chilean Sea Bass was cut wrong and very tough.  

Very disappointing and will never go back nor will I ever recommend Sushi Roku to anyone!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, love that place! All dishes were amazingly delicious, very friendly service and beautifully restaurant. Definitely will come back next time I'm in Vegas..."}
{"text":"It's ok. Ate there on 7/12 with the family. Nothing really special for the price they charge you. Didn't have saba or the white tuna sashimi we wanted to order. Feels like resturaunt in a mall. Meh...I would not choose to eat there again."}
{"text":"So here's the skinny on Sushi Roku.  It's overpriced (welcome to Vegas!), better-than-good-but-not-great food with a very nice view of the Strip.  Did we enjoy the meal?  Yes.  Would we go back?  Probably not.

I would recommend getting a window seat, especially in the evening, when the lights are up.

Service was mixed; the greeter / host was really nice and engaged, but our waiter was somewhat absent.  It seemed he was covering a lot of the floor himself, but still.

The sushi itself was very well presented.  We got the chef's selection, which had some intriguing and tasty combinations - I'd recommend going that way.  Oh yeah - the Wagyu pot stickers are almost worth another star by themselves.

So -- not a place to avoid, or one to seek out particularly."}
{"text":"I came here on Wednesday night before an event and I was in a terrible hurry. The hostess was naturally a bit overwhelmed because there were so many people crowding the connecting bar and almost flooding into the restaurant. When j told her I was in a hurry she suggested I take a seat at the bar. We found a table in the bar area and were immediately greeted by Alex our server. He was absolutely wonderful and immediately took our food and drink order. He completely took care of us and we were eating in a matter of minutes. I give this place 5 stars because of Alex's 5 star treatment to us. He fulfilled our every request quickly and speedily and got us to our event on time!"}
{"text":"Horrible. How this place has 4 stars is beyond me. A total waste of a dinner. I would never go back and I know good sushi be it masa, sushi of gari or sugarfish. Do yourself a favor and AVOID"}
{"text":"Having been a frequent visitor to the establishments in LA when I was living down there, I have always had a soft spot for Sushi Roku.  Having been to Sushi Roku a few times in Vegas, this is my first time actually reviewing it!  My fiance and I had dinner here on a Friday night while in town, and Sushi Roku definitely did not disappoint. After getting seated at a table with a beautiful view of the strip, we decided to go with the following:

Drinks:
Me: Pear Blossom
Him: Salary Man
Share: Recommended sake from our waiter

-Tuna Carpaccio: I've said this a number of times (including in my review of Sushi Roku in Santa Monica), this is and has been one of THE best things I've had...ever.  The sesame soy dressing and garlic chips that comes with this makes it absolutely amazing.  As I've said before, if licking the plate was socially acceptable, I would do it, especially for this.  An absolute must-have item.

-Chicken Karaage: Delicious, hot, and crispy, this dish definitely did not disappoint. The delicious wasabi cream that came with this was definitely helpful for this.

-Chutoro sashimi: It's been a really long time since both of us have had quality pieces of fish, and this certainly was worth every bite.  The fish quality was so great, we decided to follow on with another few pieces of Otoro later on.  Definitely nailed both of these sashimi dishes, but the Chutoro was definitely the winner.

-A^2 Fusion Roll: One of the night's specialty rolls with albacore, avocado, and cucumber, I think?  Either way, it wasn't great, and was one of the more disappointing dishes we had that night.  Didn't stop me from eating all of it, but Greg didn't want any part of it.

-Gyoza: Delicious dumplings stuffed with Kobe beef! So amazing! I don't think I've ever had anything like this.  After the tuna carpaccio, this was Greg's second favorite dish.

-Raspberry Bread Pudding: AMAZEBALLS. The dish came with chocolate ice cream on top, and a cream, caramel, and raspberry sauce at the bottom.  With my cappuccino, this was absolutely amazing.  It was definitely a fantastic way to end our meal.

Sushi Roku was definitely everything I remembered and more!  We definitely had a great experience here, and will be coming back for that Tuna Carpaccio!"}
{"text":"my second time at sushi roku and all of us loved it! ask for a table by the window so you can enjoy the view of the strip. the tuna tataki and black truffle hand rolls were a taste explosion in my mouth. we kept ordering more of those! to celebrate our anniversaries we ordered the tropical cheesecake which was tasty too, and enough for the four of us. I love sushi roku and definitely recommend it for a tasty meal, without breaking the bank. go for sushi happy hour (4-6 or 3/5??) to really get a good deal!!"}
{"text":"The location of the restaurant is awesome!  The main dining area faces out onto the main LV Strip.

The service is top notch. The food taste heavenly.  The beef ribeye wrapped asparagus was awesome! You have to try it. 

My wife is GF and they have an awesome GF menu for her.  I'm not GF, but I ate the GF items and there's no complain on my behave. The beef ribeye wrapped asparagus is on the GF menu.

I would come back here again and again."}
{"text":"Awesome experience every time! Everyone is great and so is the food! Happy Hours always great for taking a load off. Definite place for anyone to visit and get dinner or enjoy the happiness of Hours!"}
{"text":"Nicole saved our day after a long day she started our meal off with some quick side orders, was totally attentive and very nice, the food was great and the live octopus was great."}
{"text":"everything here in this place is bomb.  seriously this place is pretty damn good overall but their service wasnt the greatest cuz they were busy..."}
{"text":"It was ok... Decent food, creative cocktails. Nice modern atmosphere. Not bad for an evening out in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Well... it wasn't great. 
We went for an event at the W related to The auto auction and decided to grab a quick bite at the high top table near the entrance. We thought we were lucky... nope. 
Table wasn't cleared completely, so the hostess decided to help by picking up an almost full saucer of soy sauce and dripping it all over my lap and floor. She looked at me and just turned around and walked away. She was young, and i think embarrassed. Regardless, no apology. 
When i returned from the rest room the server, who took forever was visibly over loaded. Between the mediocre sushi and slow service it was actually a terrible experience. The one highlight was the sea bass, exceptional and almost worth the trip. 
Overall, the experience was crowded, loud and service was slow and very inexperienced (poorly trained) for such an upscale establishment."}
{"text":"The food was good however it was overpriced.  we got there around 8 p and got right in.  We had 4 rolls and after the tip we paid $100. We only had water to drink.  Like I said the food was good but the cost was high."}
{"text":"I haven't been a fan of fancy or trendy restaurants lately, so I was a bit hesitant about Sushi Roku.  Located in the W in Scottsdale, we pulled up to the valet among Maseratis and Range Rovers.  I immediately missed my t-shirt, baseball hat and sports bars!
BUT... that all changed when we sat down.  The service was amazing, we felt welcome and comfortable, and we were given all kinds of amazing suggestions for food.  The pricing was on the higher end, but fair, and the quality of fish and other items made it VERY apparent that these people REALLY care about their product.

SUSHI/RAW RECOMMENDATIONS:
Fluke Kumquat
Sakana Roll
Tuna Tartare

COOKED RECOMMENDATIONS:
Shishito Japanese Peppers
Chilean Seabass (the BEST I've ever had)
Beef Ribeye Wrapped Asparagus
Grilled Octopus

DESSERT RECOMMENDATION:
Lemon Sorbet with Raspberry Coulis (has a home-made granola and fresh raspberries...OUTSTANDING)"}
{"text":"PROS: Tasty food, reasonable prices, lovely ambiance, excellent service
CONS: ?

We came here to celebrate my father's birthday, and the food blew us away. We got some small plates, ramen, sushi, and desserts to share, and everything was delicious! Our wait staff was also very attentive without being intrusive and made sure we had a good time. Overall, I was quite surprised by this spot, as it wasn't outrageously expensive, considering the quality and location. A definite recommend if you are on the strip and looking to break away from all the buffets and burgers."}
{"text":"Very nice setting, very plain sushi.

I had heard so much about this place. I gave it a shot and ordered some of their best stuff. Very very boring, very plain. The fish quality is superb, but at these prices it better be. But in terms of being creative, having a vast list of fish, etc -- not there. The jalapeno white tuna roll sounded interesting and it turned out plain awful. After the waiter saw I was not enjoying it one bit, he asked if it was ok and I said I dont like it at all and he started explaining why it is a creative fusion dish. A high class place would have taken it away and brought me a miso soup at the least to cleanse my palate. 

Poor service, nice ambiance, ridiculous prices. If that is what you like, check it out."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku was my favorite meal in Vegas on a long weekend trip. All the food we had was delicious - the sashimi was fresh, the rolls were innovative and the hot food was cooked and seasoned perfectly. My favorites were the yellowtail sashimi, kobe meatballs, and the rolls we ordered from the specials menu (unfortunately I can't remember what they were). While everything was great and high-quality, I would suggest ordering more of their unique dishes as those were the stand-outs. The baked cod has the standard miso coat popular at similar restaurants and the whole sea bass is reminiscent of what you can find in Chinese restaurants.

Service was excellent - our servers gave us great recommendations and were very helpful in helping us understand portions and accommodating special requests. We were celebrating a bachelorette, and they sent over complimentary desserts with a sparkler! Overall, our experience was memorable and I highly recommend  Sushi Roku for special occasions or just a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the absolute best Happy Hours in Vegas - certainly the best on the Vegas Strip.

We came over after riding the High Roller...  it's very conveniently located to the Linq in the Forum Shops at Caesars.  It's on the very top floor tucked away in a corner...  

HH is 4-7 on Sunday through Thursday and 4-6 on Friday and Saturday.  You can easily make a delicious meal out of their outstanding Happy Hour, which is what we did.  Skip the line and walk on into the front bar area to take advantage of the deals.  And come early - this is justifiably popular!

Cut sushi rolls are $6 (hand rolls are only $4) and I just HAD to have the shrimp tempura with asparagus - delicious.  My SO had the vegetable roll and the unusual sweet potato tempura roll, both of which she said were fabulous.  I also had the miso glazed popcorn shrimp tempura...  this is a specialty at Sushi Roku and this HH portion was large and wonderful and only $6.  The mushroom tempura with creamy truffle miso is a very similar dish, but for vegetarians.  And it is also a large portion ($5) and just as freakin fabulous as the popcorn shrimp dish.

The HH menu is just outstanding with so many reasonably priced choices in generous portions.  And a good mix of meat/seafood AND vegetarian dishes.  There are even dessert choices at HH prices.

When you throw in that champagne is $6 a glass along with all this deliciousness...  it's pretty much impossible to imagine a more perfect Happy Hour - which easily subs for a bargain dinner that will likely be one of the best meals you will have in Vegas."}
{"text":"Thought the place was decent. Liked the Shima roll. Everything else was good. But did not have the WOW factor working for them"}
{"text":"Hello everybody I'm a Vegas local girl and tonight, my husband and I went to celebrate the anniversary of Sushi Roku. 
Everything went perfect, the food is always impeccable, except for one thing:  The service!
We ordered a $43 small bottle of sake.  When we're almost done drinking (but still with some sake left in the bottle), we ordered a second bottle.  When he brought the second one, he took the first bottle without pouring the rest of it.  I stopped him and nicely asked him to pour the rest of the sake before taking it, and he got upset and poured the drink fast and said:  \"you drink a lot!\"

First of all:  Why does he care???????
My husband and I were shocked with the comment, specially when it comes to where this guy works.
Vegas!  The sin city!!
I should have complained to the manager but I don't like to do this kind of thing."}
{"text":"Love the W but don't love that this is where I had to eat breakfast when i was there for my stay-cation.  Don't get me wrong, the Eggs Benny are fantastic and the sushi is too, but the pricing is eye-popping-high and the service \"yokunai desu!!\"  Kind of expect a jacket-required/reservation needed for their Shibuya style high prices but maybe they want to weed out the $ 30k millionaires.  Um, we're not in Tokyo anymore, Toto.  Since there are no other options when dining at the W, I will have to admit, I will probably be back, but not by choice."}
{"text":"Wow....where do I start. We headed to Las Vegas to celebrate my 40th birthday and because I love sushi I wanted to experience it Las Vegas style. I went onto Yelp to see what people had to say and discovered Sushi Roku. I literally read through each and every review to see what the hype was all about. Everyone kept talking about how great the wait staff was and how if its your birthday you get even \"better\" treatment. 
We showed up for our dinner reservations (and the host staff and wait staff was aware at this time that it was my birthday) and the two hostesses were so cold to my party. We then were seated at a window seat which was great I have to admit, the views were wonderful. 
The \"waitress\" finally after about 8 minutes decided to grace us with her presence and didn't introduce herself to us and blankly took our drink order. My first thought was \"wow she is so not personable\". It proceeded to go down from there. The food arrived so that one person was eating like 10 minutes before any of the other food arrived for the table. She never gave us the time of day but was working the other tables. Finally one of my friends asked her if she was aware it was my birthday and with a cold glare she said \"yes\". At that point I was ticked, you would think as a wait person (which I have done for years in my past professions) that you would try a little harder for the tip you EXPECT to receive from a group. 
Needless to say I approached the manager on the way out and told him that I felt very disappointed in my experience there and obviously they should look at their staff members. I would never go back there based on my experience. If you do try it good luck hopefully you get someone nice but dont expect anything special even on your birthday."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about Sushi Roku, but I also heard it was quite pricey. That kind of made me hesitant to try it out since there's so many sushi places in Old Town Scottsdale. But last weekend I had dinner there, and it's definitely worth a try. 

The atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect from a restaurant inside a W Resort in Scottsdale. It's hip and trendy. If you hate the Old Town crowd, you may want to avoid this place on a Friday/Saturday night. 

The staff is super friendly. We had to wait a few minutes for our table (even though we had a reservation), so we hit up the bar. The bartender was really good about recommending some of their specialty drinks, and explaining what was in it. When we did get to our table the waiter was really good about guiding us through their menu. 

This place serves a lot more than the standard rolls you find everywhere else. 
We had a Toro and Jalapeno roll. Excellent. Exactly what it sounds like. 
A garden roll. Really good, it had a Mizuna sauce (think spicy mustard) which really enhanced the flavor. 
And a Crunch Spicy Tuna with Avocado. I was a fan, and I'm not usually too thrilled by tempura. 

The fish was all fresh and fantastic. Prices were a little more than most places in the area, but nothing to complain about. I would recommend anyone hit this place up with a group before heading over to the bars and clubs in the area."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go to Sushi Roku for a while now and finally got the chance.

For starters, I'm less about the sushi and more about the fish. Don't get me wrong, I love a good rainbow roll but sashimi is the main event.

I had the chef's sashimi sampler and I have never had fresher fish in Phoenix. The blue fin had a perfectly delicate flavor while melting in my mouth. I'm usually not a huge fan of uni, but it was so fresh, I had to finish every last bite. The blue fin special with truffles (definitely not to be confused with a blue light special, mostly because of the truffles) was the perfect starter.

I was planning on going for a drink and a couple of small appetizers and ended up eating a full meal (I am powerless against the rainbow roll, especially after a few drinks of saki).

The place looks great. It is clean and well designed. The staff was also excellent with just the right amount of attention without being bothersome.

Overall, it was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"It's one of the best sushi places in Vegas. The dining experience was simply superb. Their manager Johnny provided omakase dinner complete with multiple courses of nigiri, crispy brussel sprouts(a must have),  Waygu beef on hot stones and many more.  Prices are reasonable as compared to other upscale venues on the strip."}
{"text":"Geat happy hour spot! $6 cut rolls $4 hand rolls and $4 donut holes filled with chocolate served with vanilla and carmel dipping sauces! Great atmosphere and nice view if you get a good seat"}
{"text":"Good food, overpriced, the bill was over $150 for 2 and I was still a little hungry after..

It's like a sushi tasting... everything is a small bite and it's just a few pieces on the plate...

two star off was for the portion and price. 
service is great, food is great too.

Just hope that they make it a little more filling then those two stars would be up :\"}
{"text":"Came to Sushi Roku with a bunch of friends and was able to secure the private room for a private dinning event. Located on the 3rd floor of the Forum Mall, Sushi Roku is probably one of the best Japanese restaurants that I've been too offering a beautiful view of the strip. 

We got here and the room was all set for the 20 of us that would be dinning that night. As I mentioned before the private dinning has a great view of the strip. The atmosphere here is definitely hip with low lighting. You have the high end modern Japanese with lots of dark wood used throughout with hints of red and stone accent pieces. We had a prefix meal sampling meal served family style so all we had to do was sit down, drink several rounds of Saki bombs, and let the food come to us. 

First up was the edamae. Fresh with a touch of sea salt was just the right way to start off a night of eating and doing Saki bombs. Next up was a Chinese chicken salad. Good, nice fresh mixed green lettuce with a dressing with a nice blend of balsamic and sesame to it. The shredded chicken was also very good. Chicken skewers were next up on the menu, again, very good. Chicken was done perfectly and the sauce that I had was a sweet sauce with a little bit of heat at the end. After the chicken out came the rolls, there was a traditional California Roll, (good but not mind blowing), the Spicy Tuna (though small, everything here tasted really fresh and with perfectly cooked sushi rice and a nice amount of heat, really really good) and probably the one item that everyone raved about was the fresh Soft Shell crab roll. While simple, it was just very fresh and outstanding. This alone I would come back for again. We got two desserts for the nice a chocolate lava cake with a vanilla cream sauce (second best I've had with the best being at Roy's in Maui) and Ice Cream Mochi which was pretty good. 

The service here was excellent. Very professional and friendly especially considering how rowdy this group can get. Overall all the food and Saki cost around $80 a head which seemed reasonable for the amount of food and drinks we got that night. No one in our group of 20 left hungry and there was plenty of food left over. I have to say, this is one of the best Japanese restaurants that I've been to and will give Sushi Roki a rare 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was awful. He was absent for pretty much the entire meal. It seems like the flavor of choice here was Wasabi. There was so much Wasabi in some of the Sushi that my throat was on fire. I like to be able to taste all aspects of my food not just one particular spice or seasoning. On the bright side the view if you have a table by the window is really something else"}
{"text":"Here's a perfect example why I am hesitant about fine dining sometimes. You get great service, pretty looking food but it doesn't even taste good. So what are you coming for? The food itself or the service and food presentation? 

If I had to describe the food here in one word, BLAND!
A few more words, EXPENSIVE FOOD COURT FOOD.

And the walk here is such a PAIN IN THE @$$ from the front entrance of Caesars.

Ok, the place is very nice. The service is excellent. Food presentation is wonderful but that does not mean it tastes good.

The Calamari was way overcooked. I sent it back and the chef said that's how it is. It's supposed to be dry and rubbery? I should take the cook over to Cheesecake Factory and let him try to Calamari there. I couldn't even chew it. Spat it out and they were willing to take it off our tab. Thumbs up!

Prime rib was so so. I wanted to ask for some A1 sauce so you know the marinade wasn't flavorful enough.

Crunchy spicy tuna roll and lobster specialty rolls were absolutely bland. No one at my table tasted a single thing. Of course, there was no way they could mess up a regular tuna roll so that was fine.

Sea bass was probably the best dish and when I say the best, I'm being generous. It was still so so.

$6 extra for miso soup and rice to add to your entree? Ehh...

$160 including tip for 4 people. Never again. Social House @ TI is a bit more expensive but at least the food tastes MUCH better."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi!! The restaurant has couches at some of their tables which I thought was cozy. They have a separate gluten free menu and Tamari. The waitress we had was so wonderful, kind and attentive. They had a special king crab fried rice and they were able to modify it gluten free for me. I tried the baked lobster roll, which I didn't care much for, but the hand king crab rolls were delicious! My husband loved the shrimp tempura with jalapeños, something a little different. This place will definitely be added to our list for our next trip back!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good sushi happy hour in Phoenix and decided to try Sushi Roku - it did not disappoint!  Walked into the restaurant at 7:30 and it was busy, but not crowded.  Patrons ranged from a group of business associates to an 18th birthday party.  

To partake in the specials, we sat in the bar area.  Our server was extremely pleasant and attentive throughout the evening.  We started with the Sushi Roku vodka drink special, a Kirin and a cold sake.  ($3 for sake and $4 for the vodka)  Sake was unfiltered and slightly sweet - we really enjoyed it.  Could have done without the vodka drink, which was way too sweet and seemed nearly non-alcoholic.  Moving onto the food... we ordered the miso eggplant, which for $3 was delicious and a steal.  Also tried the spicy yellowtail roll (average), tuna tartare (slightly below average - was practically minced and not well seasoned) and the Kobe meatballs (great).

Walked out with around a $40 tab and very pleased with the experience.  We'll definitely be back, as there were plenty of other specials on the menu which we didn't get to try."}
{"text":"I ate here a few days ago and I need to admit, the food was great.  It was a friend's birthday so I expected to blow it out. I regularly eat at higher end restaurants so I expected it would be somewhat expensive since its in the W hotel.  To start I must say, the food was all delicious although the portions seemed smaller than typical for sushi restaurants.  We were suggested by our waitress that\" usually\" she picks the menu based on a few questions she had for us. Of course you know in that situation it's going to be more expensive.  We ate had sake and beer and it was great, until we all said we were done. Our waitress dropped off another dish and said she had already put the order in before we told her we were full.  Of course we said it was fine.  Then 10 minutes later another dish shows up.  At that point we objected sending it back.
I think we were all surprised when our bill was just under $800 for the 5 of us.
Maybe I'm just out of touch with high priced places but that's just too much for what we had.  Of course we paid and took care of our waitress but I don't see a return trip anytime soon.  I think I'll just go to the French Laundry in Yountville, CA next time."}
{"text":"Im not a fan of sushi, but this turned my experience around!! 
I went to this place with my fiance, dad and 2 friends and they all had a great time.

We got the best table in the place and surely it got one of the best views on the strip! The server was great all thru the night and we got 2 free cocktail samples each, and gave us a very good recommendation of sake.

Later we had the pleasure meeting the owner, who was very friendly.

We never got to the dessert because the sushi rolls was really toooo goood!

I will come back thats for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome Japanese cuisine. Thanks to Keiko for the great hospitality. And thanks to Lewis for excellent service. I loved the tuna tartar, lobster tempura and mochi ice cream. Great view of the Las Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"First time here, food was amazing with the quality (fresh toro) and sashimi. Great service and amazing atmosphere. The manager Gary was very nice greeting the tables and making sure everyone is taken care of. My new favorite Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing  Kobe beef accompanied with very good sashimi, and great house drinks = good dining"}
{"text":"The ambience is a feast for the eyes and for the touch, this much is true, but one is paying a very high price for this exclusivity.  While I liked waiting in the lobby- couldn't sit at the sushi counter until it was open for dinner service at 5:30p- I did notice that for a venue that strives to project a life of luxury, housekeeping hadn't come by to clean food debris off of the coffee table (closest to the sushi restaurant's host desk).  Not even when a rep came by to alert me to a bar menu sitting on the table and asked me if I had wanted anything from the bar- she had to have noticed the mess?!
I ordered a $9.50 spider roll (soft-shelled crab), a $10 veggie tempura app, and a $19 baked lobster roll, all priced at 50% for one week during their 1-year anniversary.  They're all good, and factoring in the ostentatious surroundings, I'd pay $9.50 for the soft-shelled crab roll, but I'd put my foot down on the other two.  50% maybe, but $19 for a five-piece lobster roll?  Yes, it was very tasty, and yes, the cream sauce was orgasmic, but for $19, I expect moments from the restaurant scenes of \"The Ugly Truth\" or \"When Harry Met Sally,\" take your pick.
If you've money to burn or have someone else paying for the bill, then this is your sushi stop near Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We ate at Sushi Roku at an off-time around 2 pm, and the restaurant was not very crowded.  Much of the seating in Sushi Roku offers excellent Strip views which is a definite plus.  We were originally going to be sat at a booth/table close to another couple, but asked to be sat at a separate table for a bit more privacy.  The hostess got very huffy and irritated when we made this request, so our dining experience did not begin well.
  
The server was efficient, but not overly-friendly.  We ordered edamame, miso soup, and several sushi rolls (Katana, spicy tuna, California, and toro & jalapeño).  The food was good, but overpriced, and the quality/taste wasn't heads and tails above more economical sushi restaurants.  Of course, you're on the Strip, not to mention paying for a Strip view, so the high price is to be expected.  All in all, if you're looking for a sushi restaurant with a Strip view, Sushi Roku is not a bad bet.  For me, however, there are several other \"Strip view\" restaurants that I prefer over Sushi Roku, so I can't say I'll be eating here often."}
{"text":"Dined here for my boyfriends birthday on vacation in Vegas. I chose this restaurant based on the price vs. reviews and we were NOT disappointed! Both of us eat sushi regularly, and tend to be a bit picky, but Sushi Roku delivered. After finally locating the restaurant (we got lost in the HUGE Ceasars hotel), we were greeted by the super cute and friendly door girls. I was pleased that we had a table with a great view of the strip. Our server was helpful in recommending drinks, and we both started off with an order of Miso Soup and Vegetable Tempura. The soup was the perfect amount and so flavorful, the Tempura hot, fresh, and delicious. For sushi, we decided on the Yellowtail, Salmon, Crunchy Spicy Tuna, and Tuna. Everything was spectacular! The yellowtail was fresh and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I wasn't a HUGE fan of the Crunchy Tuna, only because I don't really like 'hot' rolls, but it was still yummy and hit the spot. For dessert we had the Creme Brulee Trio, which topped off the meal perfectly. I would definitely return, the service was great and for the price (especially in Vegas), you cant go wrong!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good, our waiter CJ deserved 5 stars - he was knowledgeable and very friendly"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious. I got sick in Vegas. The worst place to be sick, by myself on a work trip. So I came here for dinner (mainly out of convenience) because it was on the way to the Bellagio where I was going to see Cirque du Soleil (O). 

HH is pretty damn good here. So many options, which were reasonably priced. Hot sake for $3?!??!?! WITH 3-4ish shots?! The hanabi. OMGGGG out of this WORLD. Spicy tuna on top of crispy rice. Just do yourself a favor and get this. 

I sat at the bar, and both bartenders were extraordinary. Seriously, an uplifting meal for me. I went hard. I ordered rolls, hanabi, wagyu skewer (SO TENDER AND MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH), some mushroom tempura? and a chocolate lava cake. You can get so many different little bites and flavors. All of them were awesome. I would say the wagyu & hanabi were my favorite things. 

I wish this place was right next to work. You'd see me here practically everyday."}
{"text":"The food is really good it is nice and upscale. My group tried it on \"National Sushi Day\" so the whole menu was half off which was a great deal!"}
{"text":"So I usually try not to eat sushi in cities so far from the coast. But we came here for my bachelorette party because one of my friends has celiacs and can't eat gluten anything. So Japanese tends to be safest for her.

The sushi wasn't bad.. I didn't get sick so thats a plus! I did venture into some raw fish and it was okay. Not fresh like what you get in SF.. but okay. But really.. for the price, I'd never go back.. its super expensive for what you get. And my teeny bottle of sake was double what it would have been at a restaurant in SF (and triple just buying it at a store).

The staff was nice, everything looked pretty. But two stars because I have experienced better.. a lot and I will probably never go back."}
{"text":"Expensive and yet the food is marginally above average.  The waitress is hot and the fellas are handsome!!  All around a nice place but dam, don't try so hard."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night during Happy Hour but decided to sit at the Sushi Bar instead due to personal preference; Happy Hour is only available in the Bar area. Located inside of the W Hotel, the interior of the restaurant is beautiful with an expansive circular Sushi Bar at the far end of the restaurant.

The service by both our waiter and the gentleman behind the sushi bar was excellent. They were very helpful with navigating the menu and making suggestions. 

For dinner we had a few cut and hand rolls of differing varieties. The sushi was fresh and delicious. Benefit of ordering from the sushi bar is that you are able to customize and even ask for certain things off the menu.

The price does slightly leave a little more to be desired as this place truly is in the $$$ category which is why we can only give it a 4 star review. Overall it was a great meal and we plan on going back soon."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've ever had! The lobster rice was to die for! The decor was slightly dark but out really worked for the romantic dinner my husband and I were looking for.  I wad super happy to find a good sushi place in Vegas that wasn't too outrageous on the price side"}
{"text":"We came here during anniversary week which meant our food was half off! What a great special and they were slammed. We will definitely go back even with out a special going on.

We started off with the sashimi which was yellow tail with a spicy sauce and fresh cut cucumber and jalapenos on top. YUM this was probably our favorite out of everything. The we got a couple of rolls  - soft shell crab and a crispy spicy tuna. The soft shell crab was huge and delicious. Great fresh flavor. The spicy tuna though is part of the reason for a star deduction. I was under the impression it would be, well... spicy and, well... crunchy. It was neither. The flavor of the fish was good and the sushi itself but the batter wasn't cooked until it was crispy so it took a lot of the flavor away instead of enhancing it. 

We finished the night off with tempura popcorn shrimp which was very close behind the sashimi. These things are so delicious and popable and its a huge portion that could have easily been shared between 4 people instead of two. It comes with shaved asparagus and mushrooms and the sauce is just creamy and delicious.

Our server Kristen was amazing. She was just so cute and patient with the two tables next to us (one was really annoying and demanding and outright rude and the other just needed a lot of attention). 

The other reason for my star deduction is that when a new guest comes in and is seated, the hostess yells out something that sounds like \"airhsay\" (totally butchered that but I dont know how to spell it) and the sushi chefs and staff yell it back. After hearing it about 50 times during our meal and having it interrupt our conversation, you just get mad about it. Please take note staff of the restaurant...its not you guys its the yelling during the meal! Its really, really annoying.

Anyway, I was very happy with everything in the end and would definitely go back there for sushi (I have been really picky about where I eat sushi out here)."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time the other week. The food was a little pricy but well worth it. Our server Giovanni was more then helpful to recommend us with some new rolls (new Favorites) that I have never tried before. This place is a must for any sushi lover. Also thx to Giovanni for turning me on to their amazing smoked old fashion cocktail."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!! From the food to the service, all was absolutely wonderful. The view from the diningroom is a real treat. The tuna tartare was delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with a great little view of the strip.

A co worker and I came here while journeying on a business trip. We were hungry and this menu looked good. The place was fairly empty and peaceful on Wednesday at about 1:30 pm. The view is small, but you see the Imperial Palace and a bit of the strip. The interior is beautiful and incredibly comfortable, I really loved it.

Our waiter was kind and courteous and service was great. Our warm sake was delicious and my mixed tempura donburi bowl had delicious shrimp and impeccably cooked rice in it. I was filled and happy by the time I left and I wish I could go back daily and that it was closer to me!"}
{"text":"I've had plenty of sushi from various places but this restaurant blew my mind. We had three rolls, all recommended by our waiter, and all three were absolutely amazing. Their tuna jalapeño roll (modified without the jalapeño) was my favorite. The citrus olive oil in the roll complimented the tuna and avocado really well. Their tuna melted in your mouth like butter and the soft shell crab roll was amazing. I've never had crab in sushi before but I gotta say, this exceeded my expectations. The pineapple fusion was also delicious. The vanilla bean in the drink was a nice touch and the drink went well with our rolls. 

The atmosphere is nice and we were seated right away. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for something good to eat on the strip."}
{"text":"Was very happy with my sushi - great fish quality. And fun/different rolls. The waiter suggested some of the daily fresh nigiri specials and they were delicious as well.  I think the hamachi was some of the freshest tasting fish I've ever had - I could have eaten it until I exploded!  And not going to lie...was not so sure about ordering sushi in the desert :) 

Their bottles of bubbly were decently priced and they had a good selection. I LOVE the sushi and champagne combo :) 

The waiter was very attentive without being bothersome, even after it started getting more and more crowded. It did get pretty loud toward the end of our meal but it's in the W so not surprising. 

I would definitely return."}
{"text":"In my opinion this place was average. The rolls we ordered were decent. The view was incredible. I was expecting a place with large roll selection but they only had about 8 rolls to choose from. It would be great for someone would wasn't looking for rolls."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great.  Made a reservation and was sat immediately.  I ordered the garlic edamame, which was amazing! Also ordered the baked lobster roll...excellent.  Overall great experience, drinks came out quick, and staff at the front desk were extremely friendly.  Only thing is our waitress could have been a bit warmer....seemed like she had a lot going on personally and didn't smile nor was she friendly enough."}
{"text":"This is a nice sushi spot right inside the forum shops at Caesar's palace. We came in for happy hour and I got a nice sampling of items, including some sashimi for a grand total of $23. Food is so pricey here it was great to come across a nice dining option, outside fast food, at this price point. Their happy hour menu is limited but they still have a nice variety of rolls, sashimi, hot appetizers and salad. Service was excellent. Las Vegas must have sent a memo to all the restaurant service workers because everywhere we have gone has the nicest people."}
{"text":"The sushi had a fishy smell, so we didn't feel comfortable eating it. The spicy tuna roll appears to have canned tuna instead of fresh. Over priced and underwhelming. Do not recommend!"}
{"text":"The service is friendly and pretty efficient.  We arrived Friday night with a party of 8 and they got all our orders correct.  The tempura took longer than our rolls.  Waitress explained that tempura does take longer.

Each one of our dishes was artfully presented and delicious - I tried almost each dish at our table.  The kale salad is a must - the mushrooms and tangy dressing add texture and great flavor.  

We had reservations but I don't think they're necessary unless visiting during peak Vegas visiting periods."}
{"text":"Very nice sushi place. 
The service is great, the sushi is fresh but some of them were not fully closed, And were opened while holding a piece of cut sushi with the chopsticks. 
Great view and location."}
{"text":"Edamame with truffle salt was great; really livened up what can be a bland experience.

the sushi was good, but very overpriced; not too much for $25 roll."}
{"text":"Went here after supper at the Italian place in fashion square wasn't as fulfilling as we had hoped.

First time eating toro and damn, it was worth every penny! We ended up getting a couple orders along with some spicy tuna roll (which was great) and some other sashimi which I failed to find out what it was but still tasty nonetheless. Along with a couple of the large Kirin beers, it was a treat to eat here. Loved it."}
{"text":"Most of the stars that Sushi Roku receives are for its amazing view of the Las Vegas Strip. No doubt about it, my sights were pleased with my experience, beautiful view, beautiful people, beautiful Vegas....

Sushi Roku is like Ra sushi disguised as a Nobu. Adequately fresh fish with subpar textures and preparations for stellar prices. Granted, the miso glazed popcorn shrimp and black pepper kobe beef skewer are standalone wonders, they would be better off in a restaurant that doesn't call itself SUSHI Roku. I guess I should have known something was amiss when the non-sushi appetizers were so astounding. Sushi Roku did rebound well, though, with its fantastic chocolate cake, which was discussed at the table as possibly the best chocolate cake ever tasted, or maybe it was the vanilla bean cream, or maybe..it was because we munched on the decadent dream while peering at the most decadent town in the western United States."}
{"text":"Try the talons roll GREAT! Good service with a manager that cares."}
{"text":"Like everything in Las Vegas, this place is overpriced for what it is.

However, the few sushi rolls that were under $20 a roll were good, but not the best I've ever had. But I guess that's what you get for ordering raw fish in the middle of the desert."}
{"text":"As impossible as it was to find this place, it was worth the run through Cesar's to make our reservation. The place was very clean, the staff was incredibly friendly, and the service was pristine. We had a group of nine on a Saturday night, and they didn't miss a beat. 

Everyone ordered something different and we did a lot sharing, so I think I had a taste of 10+ rolls! I absolutely loved the crab roll, and the edamame and hummus appetizers were outstanding as well. What is that bread they use with the hummus?! It's other worldly, and I must have more. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Get the omakase.  I regretted not getting this.  3 people around me ordered it.  Looked so delicious.  Tofu 3-way was so yummy.  2 piece toro was $26!  But it melted in my mouth.  Sit by the sushi bar and get the omakase.  You'll leave happy."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas on vacation with my cousin, aunt, and mom. Walked in and got excellent service, our waiter Frank was very attentive and friendly and was accomodating to our jokes and such. On top of that Pablo, super cute waiter as well, forever refilling my water. Needless to say that was the fastest I've ever fallen in love. Great service, amazing food. !!!"}
{"text":"Excellent!! Simply superb sushi restaurant!! I have been here numerous times and have never been disappointed. Elegant ambiance with an incredible view of the Las Vegas Strip. The food is always fresh and the service is top notch. Good happy hour, friendly staff and great bar tenders who know how to mix a great drink!! General Manager, Johnny Seo is magnificent and knows how to cater to his clientele to keep them coming back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Fine establishment! The food was delicious and prepared perfectly. We had various sushi plates, amazing rib eye, perfectly cooked fried rice, finished with mochi ice cream and donut holes."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed with this place on NYE. The portions were soooo tiny, MY GOSH for $145, I'd expected more. The girl on the phone said 7 course, when we got there it's only 6 course. Not only that but seriously, everything is tiny! I been to Japan and even their portions were bigger. 

The sushi did not seem fresh at all. The color was quite dull. The tofu lobster thing was alright, and the dessert-- I definitely had better.

The worst part was the fact they kept forgetting about our order and wanted to rush us to finish. The couple next to us was even asked by the Manager to leave and move to the bar if they wanted to stay. 

I didn't even get my champagne toast because it took them so long, so I left. The view and the seating was disappointing, despite the fact I have already requested a good window seating.

The cocktail was good, ginger lychee mojito, but gah...I'm quite disappointed and would not come back. Maybe if I was coming back for the Anago since it's the only place I've seen so far that serves it. I should of ordered off the regular menu, but the girl mentioned the pre fixe was better..yea..right.."}
{"text":"First thing: 20% off entire check for LOCALS!
Second: birthday dessertS (yes that is plural) are complementary!

So we had a pretty good waiter, we got the strip view table, and waters were regularly refilled.  Everyone at the table (party of 6) had very different meals - some had the special sushi assortment, one got the seabass (supposedly the best ever), one had tempura, my bf had salmon and scallop entree (he thought the salmon was dry), and I had the complicated order.

My boyfriend and I split the crudo roku appetizer (all 6 sashimi specials in mini format): halibut with chili paste, yellowtail with diced chile, tuna carpaccio with ponzu, albacore with crispy onions, salmon with fresh greens and truffle, and octopus with salsa.  Yum little flavor fest.

The menu had daily specials which had Japanese and Spanish mackerel, and the regular sushi menu had regular and Spanish mackerel.  They were out of all of it (the waiter said new owners are too lazy to swap out daily menus.  He also said previous owners made poor cocktails...thanks for the commentary) - instead I got whole scallop sushi (Hotate), softshell crab roll (very nice, not too fried, lots of yummy sprouts), a yellowtail scallion handroll (good quality fish, but not fresh nori), and miso eggplant appetizer (good sauce, yummy, hot).

Also, I had the ginger yuzu martini - very refreshing with the meal...yuzu juice, ginger vodka, and ginger-vanilla something.

Overall, it was very pricey but tasty and delicious.  For our birthday girl in the party, they brought out TWO desserts ON THE HOUSE: wonton wrapped ice cream with tropical fruits, and chocolate lava cake with ice cream and berries.  Those were polished off fast.  Then I told our waiter that my bf and I were locals and he gave us 20% off the entire 6-person check (we saved $60).

Don't think I would rush back because of sheer cost, but I would recommend the experience."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! Why haven't we dined here before?!!!

Came in a 1/2 hour before closing on a Saturday night. Too bad they don't have late hours---This is Vegas!!  Although empty, the hostess sat us right away at a crappy spot. I kindly asked to be  moved & she had an attitude.

Besides that, our gorgeous server was great! We ordered the Cruncy Spicy Tuna Tempura Roll w/Avocado and a Baked Crab Hand Roll (soy paper)--Both excellent!!! Sadly, the Edamame was on the bland side.

Located on 3rd Level of the Forum Shops at Cesars Palace--fair pricing, great view of the Strip, hip music & romantic. We can't wait to go back!!! And they have locations in Pasadena & Santa Monica, Yasssssss!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Food delivery was inconsistent. Not worth the price we paid. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Dined here on a Mon night with an 8pm reservation. Sushi Roku wasn't overly crowded so we probably didn't need a reservation, but always safe to make one just in case! 

Split two apps (between 2 ppl) - the asparagus wrapped beef which comes on a hot sizzling stone and the tofu 3 ways. I do not like tofu, but this tofu was out of this world. We then split salmon sashimi, the katana roll, and an eel cucumber roll. The katana roll was SO good, but pricy. We each got dessert too - mochi (3 ways) and the smore's. Definitely enjoyed sushi roku but felt that it was overpriced."}
{"text":"food: got the worst food poisoning after eating at sushi roku in vegas.  worst.

service: bad

final thoughts: awful"}
{"text":"Great service and great food.

I was in a party of 6 and we were very taken care of. The server was super nice and made the best suggestions. All the staff was fast and efficient, being able to clear plates as soon as they were empty. Refills were promptly taken care of too.

Food we had:
- 16 piece sashimi of various fish, some were first time tries for me!
- Brussel sprouts. They were super savory with bacon pieces, yum!
- shishito peppers, delicious with a little kick at the end
- tuna carpaccio was flavorful
- yellow tail sashimi with diced chilled, super tasty with the sauces! Reminded me of carpaccio 
- king crab handrolls were exceptionally good. I loved the butter dipping sauce on it. They bring out kind of last to coat your palate better. 
- beef wrapped asparagus was really good with the teriyaki sauce and cool hot stone on the bottom
- we had the flute sashimi special that came over ice. The dipping sauce had a little bit of a kick but it went really well with the cold fish. It was hard to take off of the lead though :(

Dessert:
- we got the platter to share that came with the lava cake, creme brûlée and a banana egg roll. The creme brûlée was really tasty and not too sweet. The others were okay. I wish the lava cake cake with ice cream though to balance the chocolate in the middle.
- we also got mochi. You pick 3 flavors and the ones we got were red bean, green tea and passion fruit. These were tasty but melt really fast! They cut each one in half too so it's easy to share.

Wine on Sunday as well as sake were all half off if under $130 so we got red wine and tried a sparkling sake called Pouchi Pouchi. It's a bit dryer with a hint of sweetness. 

Bathroom - my coworkers told me the men's restroom has a picture of a lady looking at your package in there.. Seems interesting! :)"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere - two separate areas that are both trendy. We sat in the area with the sushi bar which was more romantic. The service was great - we didn't have to ask for someone at all (granted it wasn't a busy night). 

Our favorite things were the blue fin sashimi and the knife jaw snapper sashimi. We also ordered another red snapper sashimi, yellowtail diced chilies, yellowtail roll, tako rolls, spicy octopus roll, Katana roll, and Makato roll.

We ordered the Passion fruit and spice and honeydew drink which were both refreshing. Overall a great experience, fresh fish and good service."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but the service, while enthusiastic, was slow.  We had the tofu appetizer, which was very fresh and flavorful.  I especially liked the tofu with the truffle.  We decided to get entrees rather than sushi for our meals, so I can't say anything really for the sushi despite it being part of the restaurant's name.  The entrees had a very generous amount of food on them, and were pretty tasty.  

Part of the price tag on your menu is reflected in the atmosphere, and while the meal I had was good, I probably could get something with similar quality for cheaper at a different Japanese fusion type restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant, though a little overly expensive for what you get. They have an excellent selection of different sushi rolls, both classic and some very interesting ones. The appetizers were all excellent and i could have easily used the entire meal just sampling through the appetizers menu. The lamb was particularly good. The cocktail menu is also fantastic and they do some pretty awesome and original drinks. Definitely worth trying a couple different ones. I always like to see restaurants with a mezcal cocktail. Overall, there is better sushi out there but Sushi Roku offers an interesting experience with some extras on the menu to make up for it. Just be prepared to spend a good bit, and don't come here if you're extremely hungry or your wallet will hurt!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Sushi Roku, and I must say I came back for not only the amazing sushi and sashimi selection, but for the service as well. I'm leaving this review because the manager, Mr. Mike Kirsch, gave me and my friends amazing service. Simply top notch. I had friends from out of town that were visiting and they thought I was a VIP of some sort because of the attentive service I was receiving. Everything on my order was correct, and compliments to the chef as well (I believe it was Joey). 

The popcorn shrimp was simply amazing. The timing of our different orders getting to the table was perfect! I would recommend Sushi Roku in Scottsdale to anyone and will be taking all of my visitors from out of town here so they can receive the same level of service I received from other members of the Sushi Roku team, including Mr. Kirsch (I hope I spelled that right haha)."}
{"text":"The view is amazing, and that's where it ends. 
The selection of sushi really disappointed my girlfriend and I, so we decided to try two of the signature rolls and one old favorite. All of it was bland, over-priced, and just really not worth the time and effort to go there. 
The only other upside besides the view was the house Sake was pretty decent. Other than that, spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went in tonight with my boyfriend for our anniversary and it was perfect!! LOVED our server/bartender.. I forgot her name but she's the adorable blonde bartender that works all the time.. Shoutout to her for making our night so special! Food was amazing as always. The general manager, Steve, bought our dessert. Thanks for everything!!!!! Definitely worth 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Another overpriced sushi joint in vegas where you pay for ambience, this time in Caesar's.  I ordered one of their lunch specials, for $18 I got 7 sushi pieces and spicy tuna roll.  It was lunchtime so hardly anyone was in there, I can see this place banging at 10pm on a Saturday night.  Ambience is pretty and loungelike, paying for ambience here kids.  Sushi is fresh and made right."}
{"text":"This restaurant provides a great view of the strip. The atmosphere is hip and modern. The fish is fresh and very tasty. Most of their dishes are unique and very appealing. You can tell they put a lot of effort into small details. The sushi is very good. You can taste the quality and freshness of the food. They recommend to not use soy sauce as every sushi piece has it's own flavors. 
The service is unfortunately slow. Just to give you an idea our appetizer were delivered before our drinks! We had to wait about 15-20 to get our drink. Overall a good place to get good sushi, just be prepared for a larger bill as you need to get several dishes to get full!"}
{"text":"I am iffy about anything Ryan Seacrest related...  However Sushi Roku (Seacrest is part owner) was surprising good.  

Sushi Roku is a \"High-End Sushi\" Joint, but with good quality sushi.  Which hardly is the case at a lot of other High-End Sushi places.  The sushi was fresh, portions were fair sized, appetizers were delish, and service was excellent.  

I recommend the Toro & Jalapeno Handroll.  It tastes like butter. MMMMMM.

Very pricey, don't come here after a losing streak.

-1 star for price.

Seacrest Out!"}
{"text":"The sushi was OK, but I would spend my sushi budget on another of the many places in the valley where you can get very good sushi for a reasonable price.  My wife and I went for lunch on a Monday - the place was almost empty at 12:30.  The first demerit was the fact that they had the AC turned down to 60 degrees.  Ironically, the doors were opened wide to the patio as if they were trying to cool the desert  - the electric company must love them.   We decided to stay warm and sit outside on the patio which fronts Camelback Rd  - pretty busy and loud with road noice (second demerit).  A salad, a roll, four sushi (8 pieces) and water to drink plus tip was almost $70... quite a bit more than your average lunch.  I would not have minded if the sushi was outstanding, but it wasn't.  Although the quality seemed to be very good, as you would expect, but the sushi themselves were very moderately sized."}
{"text":"I had dinner here on a Saturday night with a group of friends during a bachelorette weekend. The restaurant had a nice, dark ambiance. I'm usually not a fan of sushi, but my opinion has changed since dining here. We ordered the Edamame Hummus with Vegetable chips to as an appetizer. The chips were so crispy and fresh tasting. We ordered the seaweed salad, a tofu dish, spicy peppers, tempura, two vegetarian harvest sushi rolls, two sweet potato rolls, and two cucumber, avocado, and jalapeno rolls. Every single dish was fresh, tasty and filling. The portion sizes were decent enough to share. The service was excellent.  We were in a rush to finish dinner and our waiter did a great job of getting our food and drinks to us."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday dinner. The best part about my experience here was the service. Our waitress was super sweet and awesome. She was helpful, made great recommendations, and even went over and beyond by asking her manager to print out some tickets we needed printed. She definitely went the extra mile. All of the staff was super sweet. The food was tasty (even with me not being a sushi person)! I got the crunchy spicy tuna roll and a side of the cauliflower. My only hang up is that it's super pricey. The cauliflower I ordered was $12. It was delicious, but it was the smallest portion. I expected a heftier portion for $12. The ambiance is nice with nice big windows for a good view of the strip! I tend to prefer more budget friendly places, so I would be interested to try their happy hour - which looked a little more budget friendly for someone like me!"}
{"text":"My husband and I shared a late lunch at Sushi Roku because we were SO famished after shopping the forum shops. It was pretty pricey (though, what ISN'T in Vegas?), but the roll we split (the Shima roll) was great! Quite spicy, but in a really good way. The tempura was good, crispier than tempura usually is. That made me happy. :) The view of the strip is wonderful from here, I can imagine it'd be gorgeous at night. We may visit Sushi Roku on another trip to Vegas. I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"I had the truffle edamame and they were delish. The truffle tempura roll wasn't as truffley as I'd like. The salmon truffle carpaccio was good but not very truffley either. And the lobster roll was really meaty!"}
{"text":"We ate at several sushi places while in Vegas, this one was the very best. Great ambiance, great server, fresh sushi. Crunchy tuna sushi was amazing. California roll with real crab and a special tuna roll with cilantro was awesome! I would go back to Vegas just to eat here"}
{"text":"No reservation and still got a table....I say that is why I gave 3 stars and it would have been 4 stars had the host not tried to pawn us off to eat dinner at the cocktail area lounge. We strongly said a big NO and that we wanted an actual table. We did get a table and then proceeded to do the famous Saki bombs I love so much and have become accustom to doing at this place it seems on every visit. We even got the east coast ladies across from us doing them too. Sushi was excellent . The lobster special rolls though $21 were delish and worth the splurge plus the lava chocolate souffle desert was heaven. Pricey food but hey I figure its Vegas so I deal with it. I know I will be back on my next visit for sure."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku is pricey and I'll lead with that because it's probably the worst thing about the restaurant. Once you get over the price the experience goes up from here, I love how trendy this place is, and they have a fantastic selection for sushi as well as wine. The staff are pretty friendly, although the one staff member I dealt with didn't know a lot about the wines on the menu so that was a little frustrating. All in all the location is great, the food was delicious and the experience I had was great. Would I do it again, absolutely!"}
{"text":"Great space on the third floor of the forum shops with fresh, skillfully prepared foods. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his ramen and short ribs. I loved the hanabi which was tasty spicy tuna atop warm crispy rice squares. The large tuna jalapeño roll was tuna sashimi atop a spicy tuna, avocado roll, garnished with jalapeños and crispy onions. This was our second time eating here and we'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Sushi was delicious. Service was terrible. We saw our waiter twice. Had to ask 2 other waiters just to get water. Got our miso and salads AFTER our sushi. Disappointing considering there are many other sushi spots around that can surpass their service level."}
{"text":"I've been to Sushi Roku twice. Both times have been fantastic. The fish was great, and the service was excellent. 

I feel like there is a knack to having the best possible experience here. 

1) eat the fish in the right order
2) spend a lot
3) avoid the rolls at all cost, they're terrible.
4) the beef

We went through 3 or 4 bottles of sake, which was poured for us as often as we poured each other's. Exceptionally friendly service from everyone who helped at our table.

The fish is excellent. A lot of fish is fairly delicate, so eating from mild to pungent is important. Hamachi after mackerel is not going to be ideal. A little experience is necessary because they're just going to bring what you order. You can also ask your server, and they'll be happy to guide you.

Highlight of my last trip was the beef served with hot cast iron pucks to cook it on. Ridiculously tender and tasty. Right up there with the best steaks to be found in Vegas, but in a few tender little bites instead of an entire cut. I would happily eat this every day for the next 60 years.

Ambience is nice. I didn't notice it being too dark as another reviewer mentioned, but we arrived before sunset and were there for over 2 hours so we probably adjusted.

Having had 2 exceptional visits, I'm always happy to recommend Roku to people and even happier when I get a chance to go again myself."}
{"text":"Ive been to a few rokus.. but the one in scottsdale is where you need to go. Ask for Dan the manager if you want sake. He'll explain it in depth. Hes passionate knowledgable and personable, especially when it comes to sake."}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees. Nicole is great and Mr. Chow made some great rolls. Excellent service, quick, and very nice staff!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had! My wife and I came here last night for our 1 year wedding anniversary. The service was excellent. The food was absolutely amazing. My wife made a reservation through yelp, mentioned our anniversary in the occasion section, and our server surprised us with an amazing dessert and champagne sparkler.  Couldn't have asked for a better anniversary dinner. Next time we come back to Vegas, we'll be making a point to come back to Sushi Roku."}
{"text":"Overpriced,small portions, and bland.  Need I say more?

I have eaten at much better sushi restaurants for much less!  Stay away! Do yourself a favor ."}
{"text":"We went here for my wife's birthday dinner and it did not disappoint. It has a cool ambience and great tasting sushi. 

Devin did a wonderful job as our server. He was knowledgeable and attentive. Sushi chef Toby made the best little crab roll I've ever had! 

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here with some coworkers and friends and we decided to do the chef's tasting menu. It was quite pricey at around 100.00 per person but the quality of the food was SO WORTH IT. 

I've never cared for oysters. I've tried them several times but they have always tasted like ocean death snot. So I was pretty amazed when I discovered here oysters that I -not only- don't hate, but actually enjoy eating. Big win!

But what really impressed me was that literally every dish they brought to our table was mouth-wateringly, succulently, mind-blowingly tasty... and amazingly FRESH. 

I'm not usually into sashimi but DAMN. Just wow.

Even the lobster dish (we're from Maine so of course we have pretty high standards for lobster) was absolutely the bomb.com. 

We had a friend with a gluten allergy with us and they were extremely attentive and understanding, offering alternative dishes for every one that had gluten in it. They made him a fresh crab leg roll that didn't look like much, but he couldn't finish it so asked if anyone wanted it. I was stuffed but I wanted to try it. I was so blown away at the simply fantastic, sweet-savory flavor of the crab roll that I couldn't stop eating it. I ended up finishing it because apparently I have no off switch and let's face it, you only live once.

Bonuses: the cocktails were on point, the atmosphere was comfortable, and our server actually spoke Japanese! 

Sushi Roku was not only the best sushi restaurant I've ever tried... I legitimately believe it was one of the best restaurants of any kind that I've ever tried! I'm starting a savings account so that next time I am in Vegas I can be sure to afford to eat here again!"}
{"text":"So glad we dropped in after shopping at the Forum. The edamame was delicious with the garlic and spicy. The sushi was delicious and our server Luis was excellent. I look forward to coming here again when we return to Las Vegas. Get the shimi roll"}
{"text":"Great Night Out.... Took our nephew out for his birthday this last week and was so thankful for the amazing dining experience at Roku. 

The design of the space is cool and stylish. The food was delicious fresh and tasty from beginning to end. 

The star of the evening was our server Amy. As soon as we begin our dining experience she was welcoming, charming and just plane on point. She guided us through our progressive meal with great knowledge of the menu items as well of a sense of fun and care you don't often get with dining in the Scottsdale area.

Hats off to Roku for a great menu and who the manager who hired Amy. Her service alone was worth the expense of the evening."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the whole United States. I have been here many times and it is the best."}
{"text":"Nice view friendly staff okay food"}
{"text":"If you go here for the sushi bar expect to pay around $90-100 for 4 rolls for two people. They have great customer service, clean restaurant and great sushi!"}
{"text":"There's a sushi roku in L.A close to where I live but I never got a chance to try it out. Glad I did it in Vegas.

Met a friend (then turned date I guess). We were thinking about what to eat for lunch. After a few minutes of discussion, we chose to have sushi. I wanted to have sushi, and my friend said said he loves sushi too. So we drove down the strip, not the fasted way to get somewhere but it gave us time to find a good restaurant. I was looking for recommendations on Yelp, the top choices are all open only for dinner, and then I found sushi roku. Great, I thought. And conveniently, we were right by the entrance of Ceasars Palace. 

It was a long walk from self-parking garage. Most of the casinos are extremely self-parking unfriendly. The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of The Forum Shop. The closest entrance would be the main one on the strip, but we walked all the way through the casino. (I'm not a big fan of Ceasars Palace so touring around wasn't exciting to me.)

The hostess took us in and let us chose our own table. We sat down at the very back of the restaurant by the windows. It was a nice view, you can see the happening strip. (But not anything close to the view you would get in your own room at some nice hotels like I've had.) Since they're open for lunch, we ordered some lunch items as well as some specialty rolls. We also tried sashimi. They had two kinds of meat there - Blue Fin is the more premium one, but we had both. Needless to say, blue fin tastes so much better. It is more tender. I love the feeling that it's like melting in your mouth as you're eating it. But my friend prefered the other, he thought there was more texture on it and he likes to chew a little bit. Blue fin is just too soft for him. The sushi we had was beyond ok, but not even close to the best I've had. Except for one. Unfortunately I forgot what it's called as I always order something I've never tried before. And usually I don't even know which is which when they present it. But the service there was really really good, our server explained to us thoroughly on every dish we had. (Still I can't remember the names..) I would give the sushi a 4 star.

For dessert we had mochi since my friend had never had it before. It was $10 but there were only 3 mochi, each was cut in half. For the same money you could buy two packages of some better ones at an Asian supermarket. But the way they put everything together and decorated it justified the price. It looked amazingly beautiful and somehow romantic. If you're there with a date, go for the mochi. I guarantee it'll be a good choice. 

And what's better than a meal with a date that actually enjoyed the food? Discount! When we were about to get our check, I asked our waiter whom we had been chatting with throughout the whole time if we could get any discount had we been staying at the hotel.(I remember seeing coupons were given out upon checkin at casinos. They wanna tie you in.) Btw our server was very very attentive as the whole place was almost empty. If I didn't have to meet with my friend I would've probably been hangover too in the afternoon. But I'm I wasn't. It was nice spending time with my friend together. Before I could finish my question, he said:\"you're already getting a discount.\" It turned out that since we had been chatting so much, he gave us a local discount(which you can find at many places in Vegas) considering my friend was moving there. Nice, so we had 20% off of our total bill. Couldn't be happier about that. It was MLK day and I had a wonderful African-American server.

As we were leaving, my friend and I got confused whether we just had lunch or dinner. It was already dark outside and we probably sat in there for 2 and a half hours which we really didn't feel long at all. We concluded it as our early dinner, even though my friend said it could be he's breakfast since he hadn't eaten anything before that. And then we started getting closer and made out.. It was incredible feeling a cute guy who's also got a hot hot body.

This is not just a review, it's also a journal I'm writing about our first meet because I know \"you\"(my cute date) could be reading what other people are saying about this place after you got home. If you did read this, consider it a secret way I'm telling you I really had a good time with you being my foodie companion. So looking forward to exploring more restaurants with you ;)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Beautiful view, delicious food and amazing service. We were a group of 9. Our waiter was friendly and very attentive. At the end, he asked if we wanted to split our bill according to our orders. I was shocked that he even asked. Most places give us a hard time about splitting bills. He gave us our separate bills and they were precise. I was flabbergasted!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My  bf and I stumbled across it by accient while exploring the Forum Shops @ Ceasars. Not only is it romantic, and candle lit, but the sushi was amazing. Very fresh and reasonably priced. The staff was phenomenal and  so attentive. I Loved  the unsweetened iced tea - it was passionfruit flavored- omg. Great ambiance. Def cozy. We had a great time there and got a beautiful picture of us there. Def recommend it and would return when Im back in sin city."}
{"text":"My husband had to travel to Phoenix for business and the kids and I tagged along.  As luck would have it, my brother (who lives in Texas) was also in the Phoenix area for his company.  He loves sushi and we pretty much only eat California rolls but we are adventurous!  We decided on Sushi Roku.  At first, it was a bit intimidating for my family as we had not idea where to even start on the menu.  My kids are adventurous but if they didn't like sushi, we really didn't have too many other menu items to fall back on.

From the moment we stepped in and until we left, I was impressed.  The restaurant was beautiful and I loved that you can see the sushi chefs creating the dishes so close to our table.  We left the ordering to my brother as we had no idea (I actually thought the \"caterpillar roll\" on the menu was made with caterpillars).  Dumb, I know.

The food was exceptional!  We ordered:

Edamame Hummus w/Chips
Yellowtail Sashimi (it was so good we ordered 2 plates)
Baked Crab Handroll 
California (of course)
Popcorn Shrimp Tempura w/Jalapeno (excellent - not what I was expecting for a tempura dish)
Spicy Tuna
Mackerel Sushi
Salmon Sushi
Yellowtail Sushi
Stir Fry Chicken Rice
And 2 other rolls that I can't remember

I am happy to say that the food was very good.  My boys tried everything and loved it.   My brother (who eats sushi a lot) said that it was very good.  Our server Max was very attentive and allowed us to put the pace on the meal.  It was a very pleasant evening and now we are wanting to check out a good sushi place when we get back home!

FYI...unless your kids are adventurous eaters and well behaved, this is not the restaurant for kids.  At first we got a lot of strange looks (and some worried) when we walked in with twin 7 year olds.  It is a more upscale adult atmosphere.   But the pace of the dinner and spreading out the dishes kept things interesting for the boys so they were never bored."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place while on a shopping excursion at The Forum Shoppes.  The timing couldn't have been better since we arrived during the afternoon happy hour.  Nothing we ordered from the happy hour menu was over $6, including
- Stella Artois
- Blue Moon
- Spicy Tuna Roll
- Rock Shrimp w/ Ja Roll
- Shrimp Tempura Roll
- Whitefish Tempura Roll
- Eggplant Tempura Roll
- Albacore Tuna Roll
- Filet Wrapped Asparagus
- Crispy Chicken
- Chocolate Volcano Cake

The sushi was fresh and the tempura was crispy.  The true testament to this place is that my wife, who does NOT each sushi, actually enjoyed most of the sushi!  We both thought the Eggplant Tempura Roll was inventive and as good as any of the traditional rolls.  You'd be wise to skip the Crispy Chicken completely as it was tasteless and dry.  The Chocolate Volcano Cake was...amazing and I could drink the vanilla bean sauce that came with it with a straw!

Keep in mind, this is basically a happy hour review, so there are probably much cooler and fancier offerings on Sushi Roku's full menu.

Lastly, a shout out to James our great bar tender!"}
{"text":"The ambiance (dim lighting and Japanese modern furniture) and view of the strip really drew me in on my first visit here.  

The sushi was good.  I really enjoyed the spicy tuna hand roll, California roll, & the Shima roll.  Everything we had was fresh and delicious.

I highly recommend calling ahead and booking a reservation.  Also, plan to spend at least $75 for a dinner for 2, and that is without drinks."}
{"text":"The foods was amazing!!!! My new sushi spot in Las Vegas The service is very upscale and the people are very attentive to your every needs"}
{"text":"Grabbed a light snack before The Mavericks show at the Livewire and I was impressed. Happy Hour has a stellar menu and its prices are amazing. The Kobe Beef Potstickers were crazy good, and every piece of sushi was fresh. Looking forward to going back again"}
{"text":"Not very strong in Nigiri. A server has lack of knowledge where each fish is from. She could not answer any of Nigiri choice that I ordered and ended up giving me very vague answer (Canada/Japan with a hint of hesitation) Roll might be a better choice to order in this restaurant.

Uni Udon is more like pasta with cream made with milk."}
{"text":"Great drinks fresh and delicious sushi! The ambiance is lively yet romantic and the all the dishes are worth trying"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a convention but made a mistake in planning the trip so I arrived a day early. I deciding on what to eat and was staying at Caesar's Palace and remembered that this place was in the Forum Shops at Caesar's so I decided on having lunch there. It was a Wednesday afternoon and the place was pretty empty which is a far cry from what it usually is like at night. I sat at the sushi bar and had one of their lunch combos (sashimi and tempura) and added an order of fatty tuna sushi. This was really tasty. I hadn't had sushi in a while and it really hit the spot. I also got a chance to chat with the head sushi chef, Kiichi, who was a really cool guy. I've been to the other Sushi Rokus (Santa Monica and Pasadena) but this one is my favorite. This place is highly recommended, but be prepared, it is not cheap."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour and loved it!
Sushi rolls, veggie tempura, and mochi were fantastic and I'd recommend to anyone.

Without happy hour pricing, it was definitely out of my reach. So heads up."}
{"text":"Great, fresh sushi! Healthy options. Super sweet hostess' + waitress! Great view of the Strip. Love the ambience!"}
{"text":"We spent the last night in Vegas and this is where we chose to eat.  We had a large group of people with usually high expectations of dinner, especially since the night before dinner was a disaster.  Sushi Roku was AMAZING and the service was top notch.  We had Bailey as our server and she made all of our sushi dreams come true.  Everything tasted wonderful and I would 100% return when we go to Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Decided to go with friends and check out their happy hour.  The atmosphere and setting very nice and clean, maybe because there was only two other parties in the restaurant.  The service was great, the waiter was very nice and helpful.  Sushi, I only had the california roll, but they do use real crab, plus their wasbi was really good, soo much better than Stingray, which in my opinion is over priced and not worth, and the rock thing, seriously, I don't know of any Asian that has a rock on their kitchen counter to set their rice spatula at home nor for their chopsticks.  I tried their Kobe sliders, I've had better at Roka.. I think if you are going to the W and the restraurant enjoy the sushi, serivce and maybe the drinks, but everything else, is up to you for review."}
{"text":"I'd say that the two times I've been here were just ok
I really liked your little rice cakes a lot
But they really weren't very accommodating to me because I really don't like raw fish and I really like my sushi done a specific way and if I can't get sushi done a specific way then I get a little weird

The service here is very good there is always parking I've only been here twice and prices are normal but I just think that the food is put me in a weird way because I just like getting what I want and if I can't get a certain way then it bothers me that's why took away a star so I had to settle for things on the menu and rely off of my friends
And the things that my friends pick out are completely disgusting. 
The desert here is absolutely amazing"}
{"text":"The food had so much flavor! I'll definitely return; their happy hour was so worth it. 5 happy hour menu items for $27. My favorite was the mushroom tempura and Calamari."}
{"text":"First I want to say the food was amazing. We tried literally everything on the HH menu, and had sake to wash it down. Food was amazing. Service was so-so. They screwed up our tabs, overcharging me and other in our party. We didn't have any flatwear/chopsticks for a straight minute, and had to flag down someone to get some minutes after our food arrived. Service needs to be tightened up, they need a manager on duty at all times or something. Also it's not a bad idea to have your food runner smile. He hates his job and he projects it, dampening our loose, and fun group."}
{"text":"Oh my god!!! It was amazing!!! The Brussels sprout chips are a great appetizer. The Jalapeño roll is delicious. Everything is great. Service is excellent. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant 2 stars, because the service was amazing. The food gets one star because Yelp does not have zero stars for food. The chicken fried rice tasted like refrigerator and didn't have an Asian flavor due to the bland flavor and lack of seasoning. The sauteed brussel sprouts were really over cooked and very dry. This might have been the intent but they should go more for the soy sauce and vinegarette flavor.  We could only stomach one bite of the tempura sushi that again had no flavor and required us to request what flavor did we order. Anytime you have have to verify your sushi type, is not good."}
{"text":"Great spot to end a wonderful girls trip in Scottsdale!  We came on a Sunday night and were all pleasantly surprised when we found out that Sunday was all night happy hour!  Woohoo~  We ordered a variety of rolls and nigiri specials, they were all delicious!  A couple of stand out menu items also included the tuna tartare crostini and the kobe beef sliders.  As for drinks, the strawberry fizz and pear martinis were both delightful.   

I honestly don't get the negative reviews, my girlfriends and I had a great dining experience.  I liked it so much that I wished there was a location in the DC area."}
{"text":"After the disappointment of Joes Stone Crab (see my review), we left and went upstairs to Sushi Roku. Great service and great specials adding to a great menu. Not too extensive, but a fine selection. Thank you Joes. We'll come to Sushi Roku now."}
{"text":"I felt like a lot of dishes were made before we even sat down because they came way to fast to be freshly prepared. The carpaccio seemed to be extremely cold and stuck to the plate as if it had be prepared beforehand and sitting in a refrigerator for awhile. The tastes of a lot of dishes were actually pretty good. The presentation was on point. Overall the food was meh for the prices paid."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Service is bad. Not kidding you on the service. Will completely ignore you when you are waiting to get their attention for the bill."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and cocktails. A bit pricy but worth it. Bartender and manager were very nice and made me feel welcomed and special. Come for happy hour for cheeper sushi rolls and drinks. Happy hour starts earlier on the weekends   They have happy hour everyday of the week. They are always happy to also customize a sushi roll to your taste or make you something not listed on the menu. Will be back again soon for sure. Make sure you try the pineapple brown sugar cocktail...so delicious!

Enter the forum shops across the street from Harrah's, that way you are not walking miles through the mall looking for the place."}
{"text":"The ambiance was very nice, although the service was a bit slow the staff was very nice. For the price we were expecting more. The taste was fresh but overall we weren't to impressed."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of the Sushi Roku in Pasadena for years! The Vegas one is a step down from the one in Pasadena, but it's still enjoyable if you're looking for reasonably priced sushi in Vegas. It's located inside a mall, so the location leaves something to be desired, but whatever.
We got an assortment of rolls and sashimi as well as some alcoholic beverages. The waitress forgot our sake so she ended up giving us an extra one for free! Really nice of her! 
SERVICE: Minus forgetting our sake, the service was really good.
FOOD: the rolls were really good but the some of the sashimi were cut unevenly. 
I've been to other sushi bars in Vegas, however, and they were all twice as expensive as this place, so I thought it was worth it. Also, they have allot of non sushi items on their menu too, so if you're going with sushi lovers and you hate it, there's plenty for you!"}
{"text":"Came in the other night with my parents, the staff was extremely knowledgeable from the waiters to the bussers. There was an exceptionally friendly busser named Skyler that was a fairly neat guy.The food was fantastic though, especially the salmon and the waiters were helpful in explaining the dishes. 5/5 stars I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Great view of the Las Vegas strip if you sit near the window, nice dark interior  trendy decor, and the bathrooms were even nice!

Service: Top-notch service, couldn't ask for anything more.

Food:  I will make this short and sweet.  Me and my girlfriend both agreed we had the best roll (Spicy Dragon Roll)and best prime rib steak we ever tasted.  YES thats right, the best steak we have ever had was here at a Japanese restaurant.  Order the Prime Rib steak, SO juicy SO tendy SO flavorful.

Overall: Yes this place is a little pricey, but this is Las Vegas and this is not bad in comparison to other fine dining options.  The quality of food you are getting lives up to it."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, friendly chefs! And absolutely delicious food! 
I recommend the Hakata ramen!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this restaurant is awesome. It also helps to be located in one of the best hotels in the city. This is my second time here and because of the great experience I had (again) I wanted to leave another review reiterating the wonderful experience here.

One word that describes the sushi here - OUTSTANDING. One of the best sushi restaurants I've been to on the west coast. I highly recommend coming here. This will be a frequent stop every time I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Loved all the sushi and plates we ordered. Excellent service and a nice place to eat. Maybe a bit pricey but in a special occasion its worth it. I don't recall anything I didn't like so if you like sushi in general you can try anything and will be really good. The only thing I remember not liking as much was the spring rolls with strawberries for dessert. All other desserts were really good."}
{"text":"Go during happy hour!!!  We easily ordered over $250 worth of food and it came out to be only $100 for two people. The crispy rice dish was so good we ordered it twice. Get some hot sake and chow down on the hand rolls. The salmon and tuna were fresh. 
Also, the manager (or maybe owner) was extremely attentive and took the time to give my friend and I some background on Vegas, Caesar's palace, and the strip. 5/5 for food and service!"}
{"text":"As soon as we started to check in, the hostess had an attitude with us just because we didn't want to sit at the bar and asked to wait for a table. 
I ordered the ramen and this is by far the worst taken I've ever had, noodles were not cooked properly and the broth tasted sour. 
I also ordered the katana roll and the salmon was not fresh and really warm.
Other than that our server was really nice and took this time to explain the menu."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for a late lunch and surprisingly, there was only one other occupied table in the main dining area. Love the hip and zen-like ambience.  This is by far the best joint at Caesar's Palace. The portions are small and the prices are a bit steep, but hey this is Vegas. I rather  feed my tummy than those slot machines. I would def let my friend take me back here again :)

Oh btw- I had the lobster tempura and calamari salad."}
{"text":"I live very close to a Sushi Roku in Santa Monica, California so its a bit strange that my first experience with the restaurant was so far from home (in the middle of the desert no less). On the brighter side, it was a business lunch so the price tag didn't hurt as much as it should have.

All in all, the food was really great. It wasn't the best sushi I've had, but it was pretty close.  I really dig spicy food, so the spicy tuna with jalapeos really hit the spot! Also had a \"Shima Roll\" which I highly recommend... spicy tuna, shrimp, soy paper, and hot sauce. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was helpful. The sushi had a powdery consistency. It was barely edible. We wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"My favorite place to bring my family and friends. Great food, service and atmosphere. Can't beat the all day happy hour on Sunday's. We always request to have Jenna as our server. She has great knowledge of the menu. We recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Excellent sashimi. Ok sushi rolls. Music is way too loud, we could barely have a conversation.  The bartender service was slow - our food came before drinks. Decor is very cool. Do not recommend the desert menu. Our bill was overcharged cocktails we didn't order, but they corrected. Very high price tag for mediocre/slow service."}
{"text":"The environment and ambience is beautiful! The service was top-notch! I haven't seen better service elsewhere! The food was pretty good too! I had the ramen and my fiancé had the steak."}
{"text":"DESSERT.  I know, I know, it's a sushi restaurant - the fish dishes were great and the service was topnotch.  But what stood out to my boyfriend and me was the last part of our meal.  His three Pate Choux were filled with different-flavored housemade ice creams accompanied by a small cup of melted chocolate; each was unique and we loved these light and airy puffs!  My rice tuile cup filled with mango, green tea, and sesame (?) seed ice creams resting on a bed of delicious apple pie filling was FABULOUSLY inventive and pulled together very well!  Presentation of these dishes was artistically appealing.

Loved the vibe.  Beautiful, romantic night scene of the Strip played out before us from the large picture windows, and we were seated Monday night at one of the cushy tables along the opposite wall (which can fit 6), so BOTH of us were able to look across the entire dining room and out through the windows.  The space was much bigger than it looks from the entrance inside The Forum shops.

All I can say is the sushi dishes were outstanding.  Delicately displayed, each plate contained quality, fresh ingredients, and it all tasted as good as it looked (we ordered 3 dishes before the dessert).  Sure, everything is a little pricey, but what isn't along the Strip?  At least this one was actually worth it.

Service was excellent; in fact, the best I experienced at any food establishment in Las Vegas during our time here in Sep 2012.  We were seated right away even though we were 20 minutes earlier than our reservation, and our server and team were coordinated, quietly friendly, and discreetly responsive.  There were no pretentious airs. 

I would not hesitate to go there again and give it my full recommendation."}
{"text":"Quite literally one of my favorite restaurants in town, little on the pricey side but it's well worth it. My friends and I come here a lot the food and service is nothing short of amazing. We always ask for Maiko she's great, very personable and loves food and recommends so well. Also the environment is comfortable and elegant. Do recommend and recommend this experience with Maiko as your server."}
{"text":"Came back to Sushi Roku with a friend and it was still fabulous.  They've expanded their happy hour menu.  We ordered the Sauteed Chinese Green Beans, Miso Eggplant Dengaku, Spicy Tuna Roll, Spicy Yellowtail Roll and the Tuna Tartar with Avocado & Crostini.  Everything was so flavorful, fresh and delicious.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  We got all that food for under 20 bucks!  Sushi Roku is the best kept secret for quality sushi at amazing prices.  The W Hotel is so beautiful too!"}
{"text":"Went with a large group, and the food was wonderful.  Unfortunately, our service was not.  We had a party of 18, and our server seemed very annoyed that we didn't want to order family style (at $85 per person), and then proceeded by telling us he would not split the check more than 6 ways- which was fine, but he also brought the manager over to tell us the same thing.  His annoyed attitude as if we were inconveniencing him by being there left a bad taste in our mouth, and two of our guests decided to leave and dine elsewhere.  Luckily, we really enjoyed the food very much, but were definitely disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"Without question the single worst dining experience in memory. I kept glancing around for a candid camera or something. We left in a stupor of disbelief, disgust and regret. 

Four of us show up around 10pm on a Friday night. The place is still fairly busy but not packed by any means. We were seated almost immediately next to the image I would expect to accompany the definition of Scottsdale d-bag couple in the dictionary. Over tanned, tatted up, huge biceps and pudgy middle, fake lips, boobs, everything, tons of makeup, absurd amount of jewelry. Cross between circus clowns and the cast of Jersey Shore. That was as good as it was going to get. 

We sat there for at least 15 minutes before a single person stopped by our table. When our late 20something male server showed up he wasn't apologetic. He immediately tried to bond with us like we were long lost bros finally reunited. It was obnoxious, contrived and poorly received considering he was off to a miserable start. We order drinks, which ends up being very confusing for him. How many large bottles of beer? What brand? Five minutes later he stops back to \"double check\" our drink order. YES, that's the order. Now put it in already. We've been here 20+ minutes and you haven't served us a drink!? 

He comes back again to take our food order. In his defense (he really doesn't deserve any), two of us are native Seattleites and consider ourselves sushi connoisseurs (not in a pretentious way - we just have a deep appreciation for and eat it frequently). We ask about the size of the sashimi and nigiri orders and he launches into a long description of the difference between the two. Yes, we know. We order an assortment of nigiri and a roll to start, which is our standard approach to ordering at a place new to us. Sample a bit and assess the quality. After more hemming an hawing, he finally takes our order and leaves. Five minutes later he comes back AGAIN to double check our order. \"Now that was all nigiri, right? The sushi with rice underneath?\" He says he's going to do us a solid and redeem himself by sending out a free warm crab roll. Ohh, yay! At this point we think this must be a prank. Is this guy high? Inept? Both? What is going on? We confirm, again. He leaves. 

Then he FINALLY shows up with our drinks and he's got the beer wrong. At this point he launches into a sob story explanation about how he was called in outside his regular shift, only had 3 hours of sleep, blah, blah. He's now playing the sympathy card. I was getting nauseous. Please just bring the food and leave us alone. The last thing we want to hear about it your problems during our dinner. 

At least 20 minutes go by while we enjoy some time without our server making us cringe and the food finally arrives. The portions are small to tiny. The quality is okay at best. I've had better at a conveyor belt place back home. The server comes back and says something like \"Isn't that the most amazing roll you've ever had?\" Dear God. No, actually, it's not. Please leave. 

We foolishly decide to order a couple more items (we were still hungry) and our server tells us the rather expensive snapper on the fresh list is incredible. In the five years he's worked there they've never had it and it's the best fish he's ever had. That should have been our clue not to order it. We did anyway. It comes out and it's seared skin on. It was, again, just okay and certainly not worth the price. Here comes server guy telling us how amazing it was again. Please, please, please just bring the check. 

He shows up with the check and, this will shock you, it's wrong. He's charged us for the roll he sent out to redeem himself. We point it out and request it be removed and he's stunned. No waaay. I'm so sorry I'll take that off right away. He shows up five minutes later to \"double check\" that we wanted the free roll he sent out removed from the bill. I almost fell out of my chair. Then he has the audacity to deliver the final, corrected check and tell us when we come in next time, to request him and he'll give us some free rolls to redeem himself. You have got to be joking? The kicker is the price of such a horrific experience. We were so ready to get the hell out of there we just paid and split. If it had been earlier in the evening I would have spoken to the manager and made sure I wasn't ripped off. 

Quick summary - this place is in the W and it's targeted at what I can only assume is their typical demographic. They substantially over charge for mediocre sushi because they can and, based on other reviews, practice suspect billing (like trying to charge us for the comp'd roll). I will never, ever return and hope some day my friends and I can laugh about how we were literally robbed of a couple quality hours together while we endured this debacle of a dining experience."}
{"text":"This Place is very good I love the food fresh very friendly very kind and I would always come here when I come to Vegas"}
{"text":"Food was very good but definitely overpriced. I highly recommend the sashimi platter. The coconut shrimp was actually very tasty. The roasted cauliflower was not worth the price. It said it has pine nuts but the nuts were definitely not pine nuts. The pear martini was too sweet. The overall atmosphere is intimate and enjoyable. The service was pretty good"}
{"text":"Had a late night snack as well as breakfast while staying at the W on a business trip. Both in the evening and morning, took the staff nearly a half hour to serve me after ordering with very few customers while the food is great, service needs to improve."}
{"text":"We are regulars at Sushi Roku and had dinner there last night; as always the dinner was amazing.  The restaurant has great atmosphere and the management team is fantastic.  If you are looking for suggestions on Sushi rolls, just ask.  They are always spot on.  Stick around after and have a cocktail and listen to music in the bar next door.  The Katana Roll, Baked Lobster Roll and the Spicy Tuna Jalapeno rolls are a few of our favorites."}
{"text":"AMAZING. 
Best Sushi I've had in Vegas so far. The Ambiance was beautiful, service was very friendly & food was top notch. I ordered the Katana Roll which was my favorite, the lobster roll was really great as well. And the toro? BEST TORO I'VE EVER HAD. My mouth starts watering even thinking about it now! & the great thing was, my boyfriend, who hates seafood, ordered the Ji Dori Chicken & loved it. If you're looking for a top notch sushi dinner with a romantic setting & nice view of the strip, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"Located in the Forum Shops, Sushi Roku was your standard quality sushi, but pricier.  The view is nice (you can see Las Vegas Blvd from the windows), but their sushi was nothing special.  The yellowtail with chillies was probably my favorite dish, but the nigiri and rolls did not do much for me.

I need more farty parts in my life. 
You have to try it. This was part of a delicious feast. The food is honestly great here."}
{"text":"I went to Sushi Roku on a Tuesday night after a convention. This restaurant is amazing on all fronts. Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere. 

Service- The hostess was extremely nice and asked us for our preference in seating. We chose a table, rather than the sushi bar. After being seated, we were greeted by our server. He was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the menu. I asked him for his recommendation in sake and food, both of which he answered with great detail. Throughout the meal, he was extremely attentive. He checked on us multiple times, and never let our drinks become empty.

Food- The food was phenomenal. Based on the server's recommendation, we ordered the Chilean Sea Bass as an appetizer. It was absolutely amazing. The flavors were delicious and the sea bass literally melted in our mouths. We also ordered the chicken fried rice which was exceptional. As far as sushi, we ordered the California roll and baked lobster roll. Both were phenomenal. Overall, everything was extremely delicious.

Atmosphere- The restaurant is dimly lit and cozy. There is a great view of the strip if you are seated inside of the restaurant, rather then on the forum side. It does get a little loud, and some of the tables are rather close. However, that didn't bother us. A lot of the tables around us were having a great time. 

Overall, I would definitely dine at Sushi Roku again. Everything was exceptional. It definitely has great reviews for a reason!"}
{"text":"We went for a late dinner before a 9.30 show. We got lost finding it and when we called they were great directing us to them. Once there we were seated immediately. Staff were friendly and great to work with. The food was excellent! Must try the baked crab roll! Too die for!!"}
{"text":"Dining at Sushi Roku on an expense account was the main highlight of the experience.  Although the dishes were good, it wasn't up to the rave I expected.  Perhaps our group was there on a \"bad day.\"   Overall, it was a nice dinner."}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited Sushi Roku for dinner and we had a wonderful dining experience.  We loved the atmosphere, food, and service.  Our server Klayton was friendly, charming, knowledgeable, and very professional.  We highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. The service was helpful and on time and she was definitely willing to make recommendations for the meal. Sake selection was great and I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Dear Sushi Roku,

How dare you not have any uni when I came here!   I don't care if you said your Friday was busy and you ran out - ORDER MORE!  

Also, your yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos was so slathered in sauce that I thought the fish might come alive again thinking it was back in the ocean.

I was going to give you two stars because your black cod miso was decent but then you sat me next to some whiny girl complaining about how there are no decent men in Las Vegas (does anybody go to Las Vegas to be decent?) and some teenager who was introducing sushi to his girlfriend and kept asking her \"isn't this like the best thing you have ever eaten in your entire life?\"  barf barf barf barf.  

Toodles,
Zach"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and didn't need a reservation! We walked in and got seated right away. I love how the restaurant is on the 3rd floor and we were sat by the window so we saw the gorgeous view of the strip. Now .... let's get to the food!

We ordered pork belly fried rice, wagyu skewer, seared salmon sashimi, Salmon nigiri, baked crab handroll, and a roll. 

The salmon nigiri was fresh and tasty. The baked crab handroll was simple but good! The pork belly fried rice had lots of flavor as well. The roll we had, had shrimp tempura, yellowtail, red tuna, and albacore I believe. All of these were satisfying dishes.

However - the most outstanding dish to my boyfriend and I were the wagyu skewer and seared salmon sashimi. The wagyu melted in our mouths and the seared salmon was absolute perfection especially with the avocado, ponzu sauce, and the veggies. They were so good we had to order them TWICE (along with another order of salmon nigiri)

Service was very attentive, I believe his name as Matthew. He was great. Always patient and kind. 

So glad we came here. There were plenty of sushi restaurants to go to on the strip but the pictures sold me. Definitely will be back with my Sushi lovers whenever in town!"}
{"text":"SooOoo hard to find good sushi in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great view, chic decor, and perfect chilly soundtrack.

The toro was rich and fatty, incredibly decadent, and meltingly delicious. Roll were nice, if a bit standard. Seaweed salad was cool and refreshing, and piled high, more than enough for two to share. Mochi ice cream was the perfect topper."}
{"text":"After reading others reviews, I am now so sad that I missed the view of the strip.  We were seated in the \"mall view\" area.  Not sure why, the place was not that full.  I guess that is the low-rent district....
Ah, but Sushi Roku, I can't stay mad at you.  Your sushi is delicious.  The Toro Tartare blew my mind (pinon nuts... Sushi Roku, you are a genius!) The yellowtail and fresh scallops were succulent.  The presentation was nice and the cocktails... quite inventive.  
Okay, I guess we made up.  This will be my go-to sushi place in Vegas.  And next time, I'm gonna see that view."}
{"text":"ALWAYS amazing...we started with miso soup, then the shishito peppers (YUM) and then bluefin tuna and Japanese mackerel sushi, then a roboto skewer of filet wrapped around fois gras and asparagus,  Next, a spicy yellowtail nigiri sushi, plus uni and masago.  Perfect balance, great view, romantic, YUM."}
{"text":"What a great date place!  Lighting was beautiful, service was good and the food was awesome!  Will go back."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Roku! It's my go-to. Dan is the man! The yellowtail with diced chilies is the BEST thing on the menu. I come once a week and it never disappoints! Such a good vibe and fun time"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have ever had in Vegas.  Not cheap, but what do you expect.  Blows Nobu out of the water."}
{"text":"Nice environment...supposedly rated most romantic spot...I think they exaggerated a bit. This place looks, feels, and is expensive BUT the food does not match up. I tried their \"best\" roll Katana and it was very disappointing. My friend's rolls were disappointing as well, fish was dull in color (not fresh) and didn't taste like the $29 I paid for. Also tried the King crab fried rice and that was disappointing as well: not much crab meat and just nothing that special. In general, the food was not bad but I just dislike places that try to make their food seem good by making it super expensive and making the place expensive. One more thing: I came in a group of 7 people and the server helped us all write in our tip....like rude much, if gratuity is included then get it printed...its unprofessional. To describe this place in one word: phony. If you want to have great Asian food, go to Tao (I'm not advertising for Tao btw). I would go back to Tao a thousand times and probably never voluntarily go here again."}
{"text":"My experience here has left me with no words. Bad service. Mediocre food. I can definitely say I'm never coming here again. It took over 20 mins to get our table some water and the waitress didn't own up to her mistakes and blamed the busboy for not bringing the water. When we got the water, it tasted horrible. Our hotel room sink water tastes better than that. The food came so late as if they left to catch the fish we were going to consume. The waitress then forgot to put in one of our rolls and apologized in the most stand offish way possible saying it was a \"human error\" as if she wasn't even sorry about it. As we received the bill, my friend realized she got spicy tuna when she had wanted yellowtail. All in all worst place ever! The only decent person was the busboy. Avoid the waitress with a feather tattoo behind her ear."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku one of the best places on strip to go during happy hour.They have great prices, yummy Champaign, big selection of sushi and appetizers, great design and welcoming service.
We came here after I found this place on Yelp and as a true sushi fan I had to try it. Well bar was full during happy hour so they gave us nice table outside ( close to cute Christmas tree). I was more than happy because I don't like laud bars. 
All sushi and sashimi that we ordered was extremely tasty, savory and fresh. $6 Champaign sounds reasonable. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Sushi heaven!!  An truly unbelievable place!  A must if you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"So I typically stay at the W when I am in Scottsdale, AZ, so this is an easy go to for our team. I have had breakfast here a few times and dinner once. 

Breakfast service is not the best at all and is very slow. The food is amazing though. I've had the Huevos Rancheros multiple times and they are so good. They are not definitely what I would expect when you say Huevos Rancheros as I am from a very Hispanic hometown, but they are delicious. 

Dinner service tends to be better as I am assuming this restaurant is made for dinner. We had a handful of rolls, Miso Soup, and the Asian BBQ Shortribs \"Yakiniku.\" By far the only stand out item was the Beef Skewers! They were to die for. All of the other food was definitely average to me. I have definitely had better sushi in Dallas, Austin, and Atlanta. For the price point I don't think this would be a favorite restaurant of mine, but for the convienence, it isn't horrible."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic meal in an excellent setting.  There was a group of 6 of us eating, so we had several dishes.  The service was excellent, as we never had to wait long for new items once the food started rolling in.  Although we had primarily sushi, the star of the dish for me was the wagyu beef.  For $60, you get 6 strips of melt in your mouth steak that you cook at your table on a hot rock.  Just a dip in a soy sauce based sauce, a few seconds on the hot pot, and you are set.  The mouth feel was \"melt in your mouth,\" the fat breaking down and the steak seemed to melt as you chewed it.  The flavor was off the charts, all agreed.  It was a great way to get a couple of bites of such an excellent piece of beef and not totally break the bank.

As I stated, we had many dishes, the standouts were the yellowtail sashimi, the crab dynamite, and a tempura shrimp roll that was a special, but I can't recall its name.  This one had a lot of spice to it, and the tempura was fantastic.  Not greasy in the slightest.  The makato roll was such a favorite we ordered another.  We tried the baked lobster roll which for me was decent, but not nearly as good as the other items we ordered.

The wife had the sauteed spicy shrimp.  They make this dish out to be spicier than it really is.  It has a nice sauce on top that has a little sweetness.  The real star of this dish was the housemade potato chips.  They went very well with the creamy sauce.

Very solid drink menu with a lot of Asian beers, which is typically my preferred drink at sushi places.  The view, as many have noted, is great of the strip.  But, if you don't want to watch cars or random people walking, you can certainly sit in areas of the restaurant that don't have the view.

Will definitely return, and highly recommended."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for yelp I wouldn't have found this place, it's tucked away in the shops and on the third floors.  

The atmosphere is definitely \"uppity.\"  Very dark modern feel to it.  

Ok, so as far as sushi goes, this place is pricey.  But, we went to Vegas for a friends bday and wanted a nicer place to dine. 

Started with the edamame hummus - which had a more watery consistency to it than I am used to.  There was edamame beans in there, which added textures.  I did not, however liked the chips that came with it for scooping.  

I tried the spicy tuna and spicy scallop roles.  They were good, I guess.  I think I've had better sushi elsewhere.  My friends raved about the crab dynamite roll, but I didn't try it.  The portions for the BBQ chicken special was so tiny for the price - I couldn't see anyone getting full by it.  

The best part of the meal was the dessert.  We told our server one of us was having a bday and they brought two sufferer deserts, and a cool flaming firecracker type candle.  Considering the place was dark, it lit up our table and made for a fun presentation.  Also the desserts were very delicious - a very rich chocolate brownie with ice cream and strawberries, and a fruit blend type of tart, I can't describe too well.

I think this place is more presentation than food quality."}
{"text":"Fresh, good sushi...in the desert? Call me skeptical, but yes, this is Vegas, after all. In the heart of Caesar's Forum Shoppes, the three curving escalators to ride to get here make it seem more exclusive than it is, but enjoy.

This place is all about three things: decor, wide selection of modern interpretation of Japanese cusisine, and overly friendly service. Let's get it out of the way: the place is beautiful. Very modern, very rich, and dark, it's a visual treat. Set against the overlook of the Strip (so, why DO people go to Imperial Palace?), it's a visual masterpiece. The bench seats that line the windows actually have lit rock gardens underneath them...very cool.

The food: good, but won't wow you into submission. I'm just a spoiled San Francisco sushi man, so it might be amazing for others. The Chicken Kara Age was exceptional, however; highly reccomended. The sushi? The sushi itself was good: fresh, flavorful. The rolls were overstuffed with so many things, it was hard to get a sense of the delicate flavor. Be warned: you are paying Vegas prices here ($100 for 2 of us with about 5 small plates), but the quality and ambience are good enough to overcome that.

Service was almost obsequious, although getting tea refilled seemed to be a foreign concept. Hey, I know the desert's hot, but I can't have my hamachi without some tea to go with it. ;-) Very prompt delivery of items, very courteous. 

Odd notes: the place was only half full for an 8pm reservation. We used Open Table to ensure a seat, but we needn't have worried. And a note if you plan to sit by the windows: there is a typical Vegas video sign just underneath the restaurant outside, so you'll get a lot of flickering glow, which can be distracting.

I'd say it's a good casual sushi place, to take a date, or to enjoy the fun of being in Vegas without killing you on price with no quality to show for it."}
{"text":"Just ordered sushi from them via Uber Eats. The food showed up warmer than room temperature and scattered as if the delivery guy was using this bag as a means to win a pillow fight. I understand Roku isn't liable for what happens when it leaves the restaurant but the food was subpar it would be more fit for a five dollar plate atmosphere in a strip mall. The overall experience was collectively horrible. They lost my business indefinitely."}
{"text":"No reservations,no problem ,we can accommodate.
That's what we all love to hear once in a while and that's exactly what we got when we came here.

As I was reading the menu I couldn't decide what to order,so I did my usual and started off with dessert.
Chocolate volcano cake and the banana flambé.
The chocolate cake was rich,moist,decadent and came with a scoop of ice cream that worked really well with it.The flambé was just like the name,simply 
bananas.The next item I was eyeing,Pork belly with egg on top of spicy fried rice.If I could give a dead man walking a last meal,this would definitely be it.The pork wasn't to fatty and the egg actually help calm the spice of the rice to balance out the dish.
Most of the sushi items were great but some them were not at room temperature and had a little to much ponzu sauce but that's just my tastebuds.

Overall this was a great dining experience and must 
give them a 4.5 star rating.All points were hit I just feel they came up a little short on some of their items.Great ambiance and decor mixed in with chill
eclectic beats make it a must if ones hanging out in Vegas and looking for a sushi spot.I am out,Peace"}
{"text":"On our girls trip to Vegas this past weekend, we were craving something other than the typical Vegas quick-fix like burgers and tacos. Instead, we literally took a journey down Las Vegas Blvd, through Caesar's casino, through the Forum Shoppes to get to our destination.

We were quickly led to a table that overlooked Las Vegas Blvd. This restaurant is gorgeous and one of the best decorated Japanese restaurants I've been to. Even their bathroom is art in itself. Us 5 girls sat in one of the leather booths in the middle of the main dinning hall. 4 of us ordered the lunch special of teriyaki salmon with tempura or sashimi that came with a side of miso soup, salad, and rice (about $17-$19), and the last lady ordered 2 sushi rolls (their rolls vary from $12-$30). We had 2 large hot sakes which gave us girls about 4 shots each. Don't waste your money here because those shots did absolutely NOTHING! For $9 a bottle, put your money towards a Fat Tuesday drink instead.

The salmon, tempura, miso soup, and rolls were pretty good. However the salad was a different story. For a salad that took up almost half a plate, why did it feel like only 2 spoonfuls of dressing was mixed in? I'm not a dinosaur. I don't eat grass and plants and greens by itself. Yuck. 

Our bill for lunch came out to $125. Luckily we were only 5 because like all major restaurants, 18% gratuity is added to a party of 6 or more. If you're looking to spend around $30 for one of their special sushi rolls, come here. Other than that, look for a better lunch special elsewhere."}

The ambiance is great; I love the decor and I got to peek in the private banquet room which was lovely.  Our food was excellent as was our sake.  Be sure to check out the quirky menu of cocktails (including one that comes in a glass rimmed in crushed graham crackers)."}
{"text":"After having a hefty brunch at Bouchon, we opted for a lighter dinner of sushi.    We made a 8:30 reservation while we were shopping at the Forum Shops.  My gfs and I order a couple bottles of sake and a mixed tempura plate to get the evening started.  We all really enjoyed the pricey sparkling raspberry sake ($34 a bottle!) and the tempura.  We also got a couple of rolls to share as our dinner and all were delicious.  Our only annoyance was when we wanted to order more food and drinks our server could never be found."}
{"text":"I went here during lunch time to celebrate my husband's 31st birthday. His parents were in town and we were with my family, so we decided to do a meet and greet. My husband and I have been together nearly 9 years, and my family has never really met his family. Since my husband loves sushi, I found this place on yelp, due to the incredible yelp reviews as well as they serve affordable lunch combination plates. However, when we got there, since it was on the weekend, I guess they did not have and lunch specials. We ordered quite a bit here, we were a party of 6. My family being doesn't really eat sushi, or anything raw, I knew it was going to be interesting. We ordered tempura and miso cod fish for them. We ordered this delicious sashimi with shaved blacked truffles on it. Also a couple of yellowtail rolls. This was my first time trying ikura, and it was delicious and very fresh. We also ordered some bluefin tuna and it was very fresh and practically melted in your mouth.

For fresh delicious sushi, this is a definite must.

On an unrelated note, the women's bathroom stalls are really really low. Considering I'm already short, I had the stoop pretty low. That I found amusing."}
{"text":"Great view of the strip from up here!  hidden on the top floor of caesar's palace, i didnt know this existed since there's no signage outside. was taken here by a VIP and treated like a rockstar! shook hands with the GM and staff, who were all very friendly. ate plenty of delish food and left stuffed."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Sushi Roku on the 3rd floor of Caesar's Palace. This place has a cool décor and an amazing view of the strip from the dining area. I wasn't too hungry when I stopped by, I just grabbed 1 roll, the Katana Roll. It was a solid but pricey choice. Actually it was quite delicious but no better than sushi I could get back at home for half the price. Still you don't go out in Vegas for value eating."}
{"text":"Awesome service, 100% attentive and endearing. Great food, beautiful view, and our waiter Matthew  was the best server we've had in a very long time. It happened to be our 1st wedding anniversary and they surprised us with a sparkler and special writing on our dessert. He rest of the staff was very accommodating as well."}
{"text":"Terrible service, management, and overpriced. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Overbooking tables, then telling customers that they have a 1 hour limit for dinner for 4? Just embarrassing. Will never return, refer or recommend!"}
{"text":"This was one of my two favorite restaurants this trip. Great ambiance. It is dark and semi-romantic if you want it to be with an awesome angle of the strip. 
We did not have a reservation and were seating immediately by the window. 
Our waitress was perfectly attentive and very helpful with recommending new nigiri for me to try when I was feeling adventurous.
Pricing is not the cheapest I have had but it is more than worth the money."}
{"text":"- Solid edamame
- Squid sunomono was delicious.  Tangy, crisp, and the squid was perfect
- The shishito peppers were ok.  Not crisp enough and the sauce was a touch too strong
- The sushi was all very nice
- The saba was strong
- The kampachi was probably the best I've ever had (firm, but not too firm and borderline buttery)
- The ocean trout was much different than I've had before.  Usually it's a little strong.  Sushi Roku's was smooth.  I liked it
- The oh-toro was amazing, as it should be.  The bacon of the sea
- My only quibble is that the portions were a smidge too small, even for a higher end place
- Service was solid
- Loads of gluten-free options/substitutes"}
{"text":"I came here for Happy Hour, and it's the best deal in town! Swanky restaurant in the Forum shops, they have an excellent variety of Happy Hour choices for so reasonable! I ate tuna takari, shrimp tempura. hand rolls, all were phenomenal! I ate and drank up a storm and my total bill was $40.  And I got to hang in a relaxing place!"}
{"text":"The place is beautiful and the view of the strip adds to the ambience.  Sushi is fresh and delicious, just like you would expect from a place like this. We ordered several rolls and they were all great.  One roll was off the menu called White Lotus and was the best. If you like crunchy rolls, try it out as it had a great combination of white albacore, aspagharas, avocado and crispy onion strings. Frank was awesome!"}
{"text":"I would expect so much more from a fancy sushi place in Vegas.  The food was very mediocre, and the drinks were okay.  I would not suggest this place to friends.  If anything, go there for the view of the strip.. although you could go to many other places and get the same.  This is a pass for me."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner....the view is just gorrrgeous, but the food was just \"okay\" for the prices.

I had the dragon roll and it was somewhat bland, but it wasn't horrible. Service was fine, except our short changed us and got her math messed up....lady, can you just use a normal calculator and not your iphone to calculate our change, then maybe you'll get it right and not confuse our whole group??? what about that?

Other than that incident, it's a nice restaurant with a good vibe and of course great view!"}
{"text":"This place is located at Cesar's forum shops.  It is a really cute small space with modern decor.  I went there for happy hour with a friend and they have a decent menu.  We were greated right away and sat at the bar because we wanted happy hour.  There were hot and cold appetizers, sushi, sashimi and desserts to chose from.  Wine and cocktails were 5 dollars i believe.  We ordered the spicy scallop role, the spicy tuna roll, the calamari and the albacore sashimi. Everything was really good.  My favorite was the albacore.  It came with crunchy onion bits and they gave you really decent size pieces for 5 dollars.  The fish was tender, fresh and delicious.  The calimari was good too.  Squid was really small so it was a little over-fried.  I wanted more of a chewy texture.  Came with a sweet plum sauce to dip.    

The rolls were really good too.  I really liked the spicy tuna.  The bartender told us to order it with rice paper because she likes it so much better and we did.  It was alright..and we got charged a dollar extra for it.  But the fish was good and their sauce was more than just sriracha.  I also liked the spicy scallop roll but it was not as fresh as I hoped it to be.  A little too much mayo in it too.  

Drinks were good as well.  We ordered wines and they have good house selections for the price.  I would definitely come back for happy hour and for their regular menu.  Place is not crowded at all so it will be quite easy to get a table if you don't go at a prime hour.  Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"I came by on my last visit when I heard about their happy hour in the bar area. I have to admit it was pretty amazing. Everything came out fast and was warm and full of flavor.  Also, a good thing to know is if you are a local you get 20% off your check when you have dinner."}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS awesome.  Great food, good cocktails, and a great atmosphere!  Go here!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here and they helped me charge my phone! I like the noodle soup and salad is good but small. Overall a good place to go when you want sth Asian."}
{"text":"Roku ROCKED my world!  Fabulous view of the strip. All dishes were on par,fresh, delicious, unique, and presented nicely to us. Top it off with 5 star service, I couldn't ask for anything more! Hell yes every dollar spent was worth it here!"}
{"text":"We were at the w waiting for Gretchen rossi's fashion show to start when we decided we would get something nearby to eat. Roku sushi is connected to the upstairs pool area, so we walked down to see if they could fit us in. It was very busy as it was a Friday night. However the hostess was able to find us a table outside. The servers and server assistants were all very helpful. We ordered drinks as well as the sushi for two people platter. Three people asked to take our drink order and three people asked if we received our order. The sushi came out first which raised a flag to ask where were the drinks we ordered.  When we finally got the drinks everything else went smoothly and the sushi was very good. The server also took it upon herself to surprise us a molten chocolate cake dessert for our wait on the drinks. Very kind and generous and I appreciate the empowerment. I know things like this happen, so I was very impressed she went beyond the call of duty to keep a certain level of service. I would say this was fantastic."}
{"text":"AG made reservations here (Saturday night, 6:30PM) for us to celebrate the end of YM's days as a single lady.  

AMBIANCE: Dim, sleek and sexy.  We were seated in a booth, which I think is the way to go (although the tables near the ceiling to wall glass windows with a view of the strip lights seemed nice too).  The noise level was low to start the night, but gradually got rowdy-- you could definitely tell that some of the tables were downing liquid courage.

SERVICE: Our waitress was super cute/friendly, but did mess up our drink order once.  The GM stopped by our table to say hello, but it didn't seem like we got any special treatment.

FOOD: Average.  I think there was either a set menu, or a previously decided upon order, since our food started arriving course by course as soon as our drink orders were taken.

- edamame: Sprinkled lightly with sea salt, I was disappointed the seasoning wasn't evenly distributed.  It also seemed strange that a seemingly nice place like Sushi Roku would charge for edamame (or include it as one of the charged for courses in a set menu).
- Hamachi carpaccio (1 slice of fish/person): Eh.  Also slightly disappointing.  The flavors were good (yuzu drizzle, etc), but the fish could've been fresher.  The girls really liked this dish though, so maybe its just me.
- Filet mignon wrapped asparagus (1 roll/person): Presentation was nice-- the rolls were stacked up on each other on top of a sizzling rock.  A soy glaze was poured on top before serving, and emitted an impressive amount of steam.  I ended up with a piece that was sitting on top of the rock-- the meat was fairly tough for a supposedly tender cut.  I'm also not a huge fan of asparagus, so this dish was meh for me.
- Crispy miso shrimp (several shrimps/person): My fave of the night, but it was essentially honey walnut prawns, minus the sweet mayo.
- Chicken & beef teriyaki skewers (1 of each skewer/person): The beef skewers featured nice tender chunks of beef.  The chicken wasn't as good as the beef imo, but at least they were juicy and not dry.
- Assortment of sushi (a couple pieces of sushi/person): Eh.  Par.
- Dessert trio: Cheesecake (thumbs down; it had a REALLY hard buttery crust), cinnamon sugar donut \"holes\" (good, very fluffy, came with caramel and vanilla dipping sauces), and a molten chocolate lava cake (very good, very lava-y).

The cocktails were hit or miss, but I really liked the bourbon one with cilantro and raspberries.

OVERALL: Solid 3 stars.  I actually have no idea how much the meal cost, so my rating may change after I see the bill.  Anything more than $40pp would be too much for what we ate."}
{"text":"This is a review only for their Happy Hour.  Taking in consideration Vegas prices, this place is a steal if you go during Happy Hour.  I suggest only ordering the rolls because i ordered the sashimi albacore and it was literally 2 tiny pieces. My friend ordered the calamari and it was not enough to share.  The rolls run $5-6 and the drinks (including beer and champagne) were also around $5 a pop. The dessert is around $3 and it was a decent size.   We had great service also."}
{"text":"For a sushi place in Vegas...  This was so good.  Omg.    In a heart beat I'll be back ...    Everything was fresh..  The chicken, steaks shrimp skewers and the sushi was all so good..  The drinks were spot on.  It is expensive though.  But hey...your in Vegas."}
{"text":"***GUILLERMO GUTIERREZ*** you made our experience at Sushi Roku a 5 star visit. Not only did you recommend decadent dishes, but you guided us in making all of the best decisions for both our pocket and our tummies. Everything we had from our drinks, to our appetizers, to our entrees, to our dessert was top notch quality! 

This establishment takes pride in their food to another level. Yes, it is one of those places where you pay a little more for a little less in portion, but was it worth it? Every penny! The quality of fish here is outstanding! If you're a fish snob like me, you can understand that quality matters and paying bigger bucks is worth the expense. 

It's all in the experience, and the view of the strip is pretty badass. 

Thank you to Guillermo for accommodating our need to watch the hockey game and making our satisfaction your absolute priority. Way to get personal and make us feel right at home. ARIGATO"}
{"text":"Bring back the Crab Dynamite! Great restaurant - but now indistinguishable from the many other great sushi restaurants in Vegas,"}
{"text":"I love sushi, and it doesn't get better unless you're in Japan. I'm a fan of the elusive bluefin \"otoro\" sushi, which is next to impossible to find. Sushi Roku, which means sushi 6, after the 6 chefs that started it, has both the bluefin belly as well as the choice cuts from the rest of the fish. The bluefin (Nigiri or Sashimi) will set you back $24 for 4 pieces of the choice cut Hon Maguro or $38 for 4 pieces  of the otoro belly. There's the master chef \"Makuto San\" who has a rotating staff of 5 assistants that he supervises. The master chef was born in Japan, and unlike most of the sushi chefs in Arizona, is actually Japanese and not Korean. They actually have REAL Kobe beef at Sushi Roku, which is also next to impossible to find. When ordering Kobe anything, please pronounce it \"Ko Bay\" not \"Ko Bee\" like a certain moron who's parents are too dumb to name their son properly. When ordering Sake, either Salmon or the drink, please pronounce it \"Saw Kay\" not \"Saw Key,\" you will avoid sounding uneducated. Remember that the best Sake alcohol is served cold, not hot and comes in several different varieties as wine does, and has subtle changes that will please pallet. Please enjoy, it's a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Listen to your server when she tells you to order appetizers. 

The fluke sashimi in yuzu is fantastic. The bf still talks about it a year later and says it changed his understanding of what good fish is.

The rolls are totally forgettable and very small for what you pay. I honestly can't recall what else we ate there.

The service is great - everyone is a real sweetheart and our server had a wonderfully dry sense of humor. She also helped us stay within our budget (we tend to go WAY overboard when we do a la carte). 

The sake was served at the perfect temperature. 

Honestly, the three stars are because I think your money is better spent elsewhere in Vegas and because there's such a huge difference in quality/value in items on the menu. The sashimi was some of the best I've ever had, the rolls were some of the worst. 

But the fluke was so good that the bf suggested going back just for that."}
{"text":"If you are looking between here and Roka Akor, as there are many similarities on the surface, I STRONGLY suggest you choose Sushi Roku.  We visited Roka Akor last weekend, had a nigiri and drinks course, left and went to Sushi Roku, and were so glad we did!  (Research!)

Sushi Roku had a great atmosphere, once you got in.  Parking is a bit tricky as the W valet was overwhelmed, but once we were settled into the cozy, elegant booth things were 100%.  Great service, delicious pieces of tuna (best bluefin!), salmon (including a fatty king!), albacore (not seared like Roka Akor!), chutoro and otoro.  Prices were a skosh high but we all understand Phoenix is not on the ocean.  Between us we also tried two cocktails and a joyous sake flight that was presented with a complete non-condescending explanation.  Large group of happy-looking women flanked the dining area along the banquette and couples and groups alike held down the booths in the middle.  We felt like we were somewhere :-) but somewhere that invites all.

Roka Akor, parking was a breeze and the hostess was a darling but everything else was supersnob, especially the sushi chef who wouldn't serve us our food (even though we were seated at the sushi bar in front of him) but preferred to yell to a server to come bring it to us.  The restaurant was also pretty empty.  Food was meh at best."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on yelp and figured I'd give it a try. I made a reservation on open table because we needed to eat before heading to see the Backstreet Boys! When walking in we were greeted warmly by the staff and chefs. The ambiance and decorations are comforting and fit well with the type of cuisine. We ordered edamame and two rolls and I felt like we were moaning with every bite. One of the rolls (something with crab I think?) tasted like it was broiled over a flame and it was absolutely the best tasting roll I've ever had in my life. We ended the meal with their take on s'mores, which was served on a plate of crushed graham cracker with a small flame to melt the marshmallow, chocolate pieces and mochi. It was cute, packed with flavor, but difficult to eat. Still, we really enjoyed our experience and will definitely come back here the next time we check out Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place amazing I took my boyfriend here for sushi and he loved it 
The ambiance was great every plate we ordered was great and even the drinks were great. I do think this place should have $$$$ instead of $$$ because our bill was like $250 but hey its Vegas baby. Even at the end they gave us a free birthday shot which taste like chocolate mmmm really good and a tiramisu cake which was just divine. We left happy and full and it was a great time. Even the service was great I'm actually really impressed at how nice Vegas people are oh and yes ill def come again"}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday night, and I think that was the perfect night to go. Originally, I had made reservations on opentable but had to cancel due to changing plans. I ended up going anyway, and we were seated right away. However, the waitress told us that the night before was insane and completely packed. She was really friendly :)

We ordered:
2 Eastern Mules (I think that's what it was called... deeelicious)
Kobe Gyoza (yum!)
Deep fried sea bass (om nom nom)
filet mignon (i cannot attest to this plate but I can say that my spouse licked the plate clean)

Drinks were on point, gyoza yummy, and fish soooooooo good!!

Rolls sounded pretty yummy too.. I was happy with my choice to come here!"}
{"text":"this place serves average sushi at premium sushi prices. we sat at the bar, and the sushi chefs and waitress were somewhat attentive, but nothing could make up for the flavorless, lackluster tuna and slimy uni. i didn't try any rolls, or tempura/cooked dishes. if you're looking for great, fresh fish in vegas, this is not the place."}
{"text":"After talking with friends and getting recommendations, was looking forward to dinner. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to expectations. Edamame came out burnt, the short ribs were extremely overcooked, and the lobster roll had some sort of cheese/Benedict sauce on it that wasn't appetizing. Maybe it was just an off night, but we were disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Yeah, this is without a doubt the best meal we had in Vegas - and it wasn't even a meal in the traditional sense.  We had their Happy Hour, which my wife assured me would be LIKE a meal.  I don't usually believe her when she says stuff like that.

This was outstanding.  Lots of vegetarian options and the food was out of this world good.  I'm still thinking about the sweet potato roll I had and even better was this amazing mushroom tempura.  I am not someone that believes Happy Hour food = a meal but in this case,  I was sold.  We had so much food we had to take some back to our hotel.  And the service at the bar was perfect.  Cannot recommend enough.  This is the best deal in Vegas."}
{"text":"i've been here twice.  it has a good view of the strip and the ambiance is nice, but the food and the price don't go well together.  the chilean sea bass appetizer was good and we did order 2 of those, but everything else was just alright.  the sushi rolls we ordered weren't spectacular either.  the baked lobster roll was pretty plain and the spicy rock shrimp tasted pretty ordinary.  ummm...if you want to eat somewhere for view and ambiance and have a mediocre meal that costs more than mediocre, then this is the place to go.  it's not terrible, just don't expect food that's greatness.   happy sushi roku-ing."}
{"text":"Yum! Summer picked Sushi Roku for her Vegas birthday celebration dinner and I'm so happy that she did! The six of us were seated at an awesome round table with a super view of the Las Vegas strip.

We started with a large order of sake-bombing materials (two of the six were sake-bombing virgins!) and a couple of the signature cocktails. I tried the lycee mojito which was good but not lycee-y enough and the other girls loved the tropical peach passion and lycee martini. 

We ordered a wide variety of dishes to share and for personal consumption. I liked the crispy chicken appetizer with yummy dipping sauce and the spicy tuna and california rolls. I usually love eel sushi but our eel was overly fishy. Summer tried a signature roll with tuna, cilantro, and more which was yummy though wasabi-infused and spicy! The salty edaname were also very good and Rachel couldn't stop raving about the sea bass main dish. 

Our sweet waitress gave us a complimentary birthday sake jug and a fun mini-birthday celebration of molten chocolate cake and a crazy sparkler. For about $65 each, we all left satiated and ready to party!"}
{"text":"Delish!

Well, this super cool spot was my favorite sushi spot in LA, CA and now they have graced Scottsdale!  I would compare it to Asia De Cuba (but better - not trying that hard) and decor blows ADC away! 

Very hip and not too crowded (yet).  Hope it can keep a trendy feel (while still remaining sophisticated).  All sushi rolls were great and loved the Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus (very tiny, but tasty) Loved banana desert & signature cocktails.

The decor is amazing.  Upstairs bar with pool is pure eye candy.  Love the red shades.  A back drop for a great night out for sure.

Service was AMAZING.  Hostess was friendly and professional, GM came to our table - very cool and nice.  Waitress rocked - what more can I say?  LOVED IT!  Going back again tonight!"}
{"text":"They charge $50 for 8 pieces of sushi. This place should have four dollar signs instead of three!!!!! It was okay. The price is not worth it and no one was even full. The service was pretty bad too. We had to ask for wasabi and ginger."}
{"text":"I did not expect to find good sushi out in the desert. This place was a very pleasant surprise. We were seated at a square table with comfortable leather bench seats for all. The big windows gave us a great view of the strip.

Props to our waiter for pushing the yellowtail diced chilies hard. In addition to the great service he provided, his recommendation was maybe the best thing we ate. 

We ordered several rolls, most of them some variation on spicy tuna. We also ordered the crab roll. With the exception of the tuna jalapeno roll, all of them were great. Nothing mind blowing creatively, just quality ingredients and great execution. The jalapeno in the tuna jalapeno roll was just too spicy and washed out all of the other flavors. Just remove the jalapeno and you have a fine tuna roll. In addition to the rolls we ordered the short rib fried rice which was also delicious.

For dessert we had the donut holes and the green tea tiramisu. The tiramisu was a little light on flavor and I wasn't a big fan of the donuts but at this point I was completely full so I wasn't in the best position to judge.

The bill also wasn't as much as I'd expected to be. Good times."}
{"text":"We had the soft shell crab roll. It tasted like shrimp that had the tail on and was rolled in sand. Very odd flavor and textures. The staff is really nice though."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing Sushi, conveniently located in the Caesars palace shopping forum. I was thoroughly impressed with everything we had. Which included the Katana roll, Dynamite Roll (which was outstanding), rainbow roll, and various Sashimi."}
{"text":"I am an avid patron of sushi restaurants and had never tried sushi roku before this past weekend when my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try. Immediately I felt comfortable with the decor, lighting and layout; it felt like a place I would enjoy. All of those emotions came to fruition with our server, John. He was friendly, energetic and clearly knowledgeable and able to answer all of our questions. Then the food came brining it all together. Starting with the edamame and though out all of our various rolls, I was very pleased. With all of this said, I cannot wait to come back and have recommended sushi roku to some friends ( and to sit in John's section if at all possible)"}
{"text":"Grade A sushi quality.  A few specialty rolls...outstanding. I came for lunch. Pleasant staff though service flow was rushed.  I detest all courses being delivered at once.  Other than that the dishes were beautifully prepared and presented. I'm really a fan of the crunchy spicy tuna roll!"}
{"text":"Excellent Sushi. Very good view. Service was excellent. Not a fan of the signature cocktails. Expensive, but this is Vegas... So to be expected."}
{"text":"Good sushi spot, cool views of the strip. typical vegas prices, ie you get half the quality at twice the price, but how else can they build all those casinos? cant rely on gambling loses anymore i guess. we very much enjoyed the meal. sushi was VERY slow coming out. everything else was quick  and good."}
{"text":"Very surprised with the quality of sushi here. Even though Vegas is in the middle of the desert the fish was FRESH! I highly recommend this place, the service was great and we got a great view. 

The only complaint I have is that the hot stone plate I ordered wasn't what I was expecting. It was still good though!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Sushi person, but our host was, so game on!  I had the Makoto Roll
(Spicy Yellowtail & Shrimp Tempura wrapped wtih Seared Tuna,
Spicy Creamy Sauce 17) and it was the best of all the things we had.  I don't even know what the others ordered, but they were all just ok.  The atmosphere is really chic, the wait staff is helpful and attentive.  Our host had said this was a great place, but I wasn't overly impressed, though I would never say that to him.  Maybe if I was more of sushi person I would have thought more highly of it?"}
{"text":"Sushi Roku is very elegant and romantic. The perfect spot for a date, really. It has an awesome view, is dimly lit, and it just makes you want to cuddle a little closer together. 

My experience here was great. If I had been the one to pay, though, I probably wouldn't feel the same way. We ordered 2 Miso soups with Tofu, a Sashimi combo (6 pieces), the Crunchy Spicy Tuna w/ Avocado Roll, the Katana Roll, Green Tea fried ice cream, and some banana dessert. The portions were smaller than usual, but the quality, I would agree, was also better than the typical. The total came out to be a little over $100, not including tip. 

Thanks, Bug, for such a romantic and fun date. Swooooon. :)"}
{"text":"We came here for a really fun birthday celebration! The decor is stunning, and views of the strip are amazing. What really cracks me up is that front and center is the Imperial Palace, and I have never seen it look so good as from this vantage. 

The lychee martini was to die for, and sake bombs tasted like sake bombs always taste. Once the waitress found out we were celebrating a birthday she comped a bottle of sake! I loved our crispy chicken appetizer with delicious dipping sauce. Our rolls were decent, but the eel was a little off. The sushi wasn't as fresh as I am used to, but you are in the middle of the desert for god's sake! 

The birthday desert was the best part of the meal! They brought out this crazy sparkler that shot sparks about 2 feet above the table. I was seriously worried birthday girl was going to get burned by more than the sake. Sushi Roku had it under control. The chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream they brought out was great, and they were super quick with our bill as soon as we let them know we were running late."}
{"text":"We walked up to the empty restaurant around 9:45/10 and there was no hostess. She saw us and took her time to come back and asked us if we had a reservation with a lot of attitude. She even made an exaggerated sigh as if we seemed to bother her. We ended up leaving and eating at Nobu which is the better option!"}
{"text":"Decided to dine here our last night in Vegas on a whim. Needed someplace we could just walk in. This was perfect! Went early evening with my husband and another couple and were seated immediately. It was Sunday night and pretty quiet. I ordered a dirty martini right off thebat. It was served quickly and was perfect. We decided to order some soups and a couple of rolls to start. The soup was delicious, just what I want in a miso soup. The waiter was very helpful in suggesting what rolls we might like and what looked good that evening. All were quite tasty and beautifully presented, simple but beautiful. He was very patient with us as we like to order just a couple of items at a time so as not to crowd the table or over eat. Great view of the strip as well. Prices were reasonable and I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Good sushi makes me cry.  This night, I was a baby that couldn't stop.  Seriously, wow.  Hot damn.  More please.  Expensive? Yes, but who really cares when it is mind blowing good.

I started with a Lychee Mojoito (tasty) and miso soup (average to good).  My world officially became rocked when the Hanabi: Spicy Tuna over a Crispy Rice Cake came to the table.  I'm sure if I saw a video of my reaction, I would be completely embarrassed but I can honestly say it was one of the best hot appetizers I have ever had. My poor waitress had to put up with me through all this.  I'm so sorry.

We ordered two rolls, Shima roll: spicy tuna & avo w/shrimp, cilantro & wrapped with soypaper; and the Baked Lobster Roll: Lobster & asparagus on the inside and a baked yellow sauce consisting of sweet miso & egg.  I was in sushi heaven.

Great service, awesome atmosphere, pretty good chill music for the environment.  All this with a beer and another mixed drink, approx $150.  

You can not stop me from going back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Food, drinks, atmosphere was fun, exciting, and delicious. Thank you Dan for taking care of your customers! Me and my friends will be back 100%! This is a must go restaurant!"}
{"text":"Like this place, came the day after thanksgiving for lunch, and it was nice, the place wasn't that busy, but it meant service was great.  Waiter recommended some items that didn't disappoint.  We didn't drink, but had a look over the Saki menu, looked good."}
{"text":"Wonderful Japanese cuisine. I am not a Japanese so I am not sure if the food here is authentic, but what I am sure is that the food tastes great. This place has unique cuisines like mako sushi and katana roll that are definitely worth trying. Food is well prepared and fresh."}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal experience! Everything was extremely delicious. Fresh sushi, great flavors, great service. CJ knows everything about the menu and made amazing suggestions, request him! Baked King Crab roll anyone. Half price wine bottles on Sunday and Monday too! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Really wasn't impressed. Ordered several different rolls and an appetizer but meh. Service was fine, got seated right away. There's gotta be better sushi  somewhere else in LV."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday. The food was good and the service was good, I would go definitely go bavk again (especially since I found out they have a happy hour)"}
{"text":"We ate here on the first day of our trip to Las Vegas. We quickly learned that happy hour was the best time to check out the restaurants we were most looking forward to, Sushi Roku was one. Located at the forum shoppes at Caesars, we were quickly pleased with their happy hour menu, lots of delicious choices. 

There was not a huge amount of bar seating, a smaller bar and a family style high top table were the only options. We ended up having to wait a little for two seats together. After we did we were quickly greeted by our waiter. 

I ordered Hanabi- spicy tuna on crispy rice, an organic garden salad with yuzu ginger, a salmon avocado roll, shrimp tempura with asparagus and Wagyu Skewers (not on happy hour menu) along with a glass of their happy hour champagne. 

I loved the hanabi. It was absolutely delicious and something I have never had before. The salad was not the typical Japanese salad I was hoping for, it was just Ok, this was something I could have done without. The salmon avocado roll was delicious and exactly what I was hoping it would be. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked the shrimp tempura with asparagus because typically I don't care for asparagus. So far, so good. 

Here is where I knocked off a star for the overall review. Never having wagyu before I didn't know what to expect it to look or taste like but I have heard incredible things about this particular meat. I was very clear in ordering the Wagyu skewers. However come to find out thats not what I got and unfortunately I didn't realize until after I had ate them. I saw a plate of actual beef and skewers pass me and I realized...thats definitely not what I got and I didn't even enjoy it. So I looked back at the menu and what I received was the Rib-eye wrapped asparagus. How does one screw that up? They don't even sound similar. But again, I just figured okay the asparagus was the skewer and I had no idea what the Wagyu would have tasted like because I had never had it. I was beyond disappointed. I called over the server and I asked him what it was that was brought to me. He said, It was the rib eye asparagus. I kindly replied, that wasn't what I ordered. His response \"oh I rang it in wrong\" ... no apology or anything? Then not only that, but I was charged for what I didn't even order and mistakenly ate. Had I not ate it, I would not have accepted this but being that I ate it I just let it go. However being that he acknowledged he rang it in wrong, he should have compensated in some way. This was incredibly disappointing. 

Overall we enjoyed our meal. Aside from our server- issues and the rib eye wrapped asparagus which I did not enjoy, I would still recommend this for anyone looking for a sushi happy hour."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had a last minute trip to Las Vegas on Valentine's Day and of course just about everything was booked! So we went on Open Table and found out Sushi Roku had late night reservations. We went for a nice stroll and went to our dinner. We were sat at an great table next to an exquisite view of the Las Vegas strip. It was very romantic, the crowd was very hip, and the attire was semi-casual. We ordered the truffle edamame (definite recommendation) and 3 rolls of sushi to split. Don't bother going to Kabuki or any second rate sushi place because the sushi here is delicious! The only thing I would complain about is the price but you pay for quality and you look like a stud waving the check to your date at the end of the night!"}
{"text":"Wow. I'm not easy to please, but this place just became a must visit on every trip to Vegas for us. Sushi Roku and Mesa Grill. Those are our two must hit spots. 

The Salmon Carrasco and the Matsu were unreal. Tuna Poke was delicious, and the Chocolate lava cake was equally amazing. Nothing that we ordered was less than excellent. 

Service was perfect. 

Cocktails were good. A bit underwhelming for the $15 price tag, but all were good. Their beer selection even had a couple of beers that I haven't had, which is rare. 

All in all, a home run."}
{"text":"This is the sushi place you need to go to instead of nobu.  For a fraction of the price you get sushi that is just as delicious, and with happy hour bar and sushi prices.  Can't beat it.  Last time I was in Vegas I literally went to nobu, spent $100 alone, then left and went to sushi roku and spent $35 and got full. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the food is delicious.  Some of my favorite sushi ever, not just in Vegas.  It's hidden way at the top of the Caesars forum shops, but it's well worth it to go and eat there. So delicious!!"}
{"text":"We ate here mainly because the online menu looked like \"normal\" sushi. Although when we got there, it was mostly Japanese entrees with some sushi. I personally like the Americanized sushi rolls that contain very little raw fish. I know that's not what real sushi is, but I'd rather not eat a moving octopus.  Anyways, they had some good stuff. We had the Crunchy Tuna roll and the Katana roll. The Crunch roll was amazing, it had spicy tuna inside. The Katana roll had raw tuna on the top that was like warm, not a fan of warm raw fish. But it looked nice. 

The atmosphere was interesting. It was super dark inside like a fancy restaurant but the techno music was so loud that I couldn't  have a conversation at all. The staff was super nice and very helpful though. 

Did I like it?; sort of. Would I come back?: No."}
{"text":"Sparklers on your birthday?! Count me IN!

FOOD: My friend ordered the scallops with foie gras..and then ordered two more for the table. NO JOKE. This dish is a MUST ORDER. The scallops were cooked to perfection. Me, not being a big fan of foie gras, even loved the combination. I ordered the hot soba, which was pretty good! Their rolls are a good serving size, so I would suggest ordering rolls or an entree and splitting the scallops. Did I mention that they're amazing???

SERVICE: Our waitress was super nice. When the restaurant was a little less busy (we were seated at 5:30PM), the manager even came over and asked us how everything was. Superb service! We had mentioned that it was our friend's birthday that day, so they came out at the end with molten chocolate cake and THE MOST AWESOME SPARKLER EVER. Seriously, such good service.

Why the three stars? Everything was pretty expensive, and there is much more for your money on the strip. If it were anywhere else, this place would definitely get a four!"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere and truly AMAZING sushi!  High quality sushi, created by knowledgeable sushi chefs.  The nigiri was perfection. Can't go wrong here; it's all delectable. 

Our server was great too. 

There was a large party dining at the same time and it did not affect the timing in our meal."}
{"text":"My relationship with Sushi Roku is a love hate thing, from beginning to end. I went with a group of 7 friends on opening day and we were able to get a reservation simply based on our positions at various hotels around the valley, and saw a 30 minute wait after our 8:30PM reservation, which was ok seeing as they squoze us in. When I pulled up, I was amazed at all the vehicles in the valet lot, so I kept driving and parked around the corner. The place made me feel small from the beginning!

The entire space is beautiful and very well done. It's hip, yet upscale, and a very fun atmosphere. The servers are very friendly even though some of them are not fully trained in the restaurant. The food I had was delicous. Tuna on fried brown rice cake was delicious, as was the salmon and toro sushi. The yakatori sticks were very bland and almost seemed as though they were done with a greek seasoning, rather than a sweet Japanese. The food did come out quickly, even on a day when the place was packed way over capacity. Drinks, however, were not so quick. I had 2 greyhounds @ 14 each and I swear neither of them had any alcohol in them and have heard similar grumblings from others as well. I have to assume their bartenders have previous experience from other places, but it didn't seem as such. I heard a LOT of smashed glasses as well. The whole night seemed like a mess for them.

The restrooms were very cool, if not a bit confusing. They told me to go in through the door to the restrooms and I saw a lot of women standing around and figured I was headed for the womens room. But infact the men and women share the communal sinks and waiting areas, but have their own bathroom area, which was different. I feel the atmosphere was definitely typical Scottsdale but a little different in some areas where it was obvoius they put some neat touches in it. 

I had one major gripe with the place, a little out of the restaurants control, was the overzealous attitude of their loss prevention department. These guys thought they were professional bouncers at Las Vegas night clubs.  We had been going back and forth between the restaurant and the lobby all night with no problems. At one point a big black guy said I cant come in, and this was after my whole party just went in front of me. I said \"look count chocula, I've been in here all night, and all of my friends just walked by you. Don't stand there and tell me your hands are tied or you are over capicaty or something like that, because I know it is bs. I'm going past you.\" His co-worker came over and told him to let me in. The guy would have beat  me into the ground if he had wanted to but it worked out. 

They need to get their security department going in a proper fashion, and work on the bar quite a bit, and the place will be a real winner. I'm sure that it will come with time, so I'm giving it 4 stars under the assumption that it is going to improve in time."}
{"text":"Holy sh*t this place is awesome. First, the atmosphere - it's loud, lots of people, fun music. Cool interior design and lots of big windows to look out over the strip. 

More importantly - the food. Wow. I don't want to say too much lest I oversell here, but it was soooo good! We started with the shishito peppers - very crunchy and good spice. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts - so delicious with chunks of bacon and sweet sauce. Then we had the katana sushi roll - the fish just melted in my mouth. We then had the toro roll, which was delicious and had a wonderful crunch from the jalapeño (but not very spicy). My friend ordered the pork belly fried rice - such a delicious, flavorful bite with fantastic texture and yummy egg. She also had the braised ribs which had a wonderful, unexpected melange of flavors. Our other friend ordered the chicken, which was delicious if not a little boring in comparison to all of the other amazing flavors on the table."}
{"text":"I'm not too crazy about sushi, but I loved Sushi Roku!

We had to wait quite a while for our table, so we had some apps and drinks at the bar. When we were seated, we put ourselves in the waitress' hands and left the ordering to her. I think it might have been the chef's tasting menu.

We were pretty full on the soup and apps, so by the time the sushi came out, I was pretty full, but tried the sushi anyway. if I can eat at Sushi Roku every time I try sushi, I may learn to love it after all..."}
{"text":"Was seated and ignored for 5 minutes, no greeting. Then the waitress comes up asking if I was \"ready to order?\" Of course I said yes because I didn't know if she would come back if I had said \"no\".

Where the service lacked, the fish was their saving grace. Had the yellowtail sashimi and their specialty roll - the Titan! Delicious all around. Wish I could do 2.5 stars cause that was my overall experience."}
{"text":"WOW! This place is amazing. Great service, fresh sushi, and the mixed drinks are to die for."}
{"text":"Great find for us only being here for 2 nights. Probably top 3 sushi I've eaten. Adam our server was excellent. Recommended some great dishes. May even come back tomorrow night to try rest of menu."}
{"text":"Service was great!!! 

Food was good.  Now I understand the difference between normal mackarel and japanese mackarel.  Japanese one is better.

Portion sizes were very very very small.  We ordered the Omakase, and left hungry.  Had to stop at I *Heart* Burgers at the Palazzo shops to fill up.  So, go for a snack, not a meal."}
{"text":"The sushi is sublime. You will not be dissappointed. Very expensive but worth it I think."}
{"text":"nice decor, view of the strip at certain spots, good variety of sushi, just get ready to spend bank if you want to try all the good stuff, this place is a bit expensive..."}
{"text":"An absolute favorite of ours!! The food is outstanding, service impeccable, and just an overall wonderful dining experience. My husband has eaten sushi in many places and feels this is by far the best, and for the non sushi lovers the steak is amazing. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Wait staff are all young men who are very polished and extremely polite. Our waiter was very excited to talk about the vast variety of sake available, and through a series of a couple of quick questions , he was able to identify what sake he could recommend. And he was got it right! The food was great. The salmon capriccio was excellent"}
{"text":"Celebrated my spouse bday last night at Sushi Roku LV. It's located at the forum shops 2nd Floor. Love the ambiance and it's not too loud inside. Food was good but not that great. Their lava cake is a must try! The best I had so far! Will comeback next time and will try their happy hour."}
{"text":"Halibut.  Yellow-tail belly. Seaweed salad. Katana roll, Tori Jalapeno.  Sushi Chef.

Dinner was good, service has been generally good on most dinners here, but every so often I will get left alone and not helped properly.

The sushi is generally good however, extremely over priced compared to other sushi places in the area.

Very trendy and worth a visit, however, unless you are staying at the W, i doubt it would become a regular stop, outside of their AMAZING happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Inventive, creative dishes in a weird location. 

Yes it's mall sushi. But Vegas mall sushi means ignoring the entrance near the dress shop and escalator and sitting by the window overlooking the strip.

With hip decor and a robust menu, there's a lot here to like even before taking your first bite.

And the first bite changes everything. Butter poached lobster. Truffle edamame. Ginger marinated octopus with citrus. Even things that you've had taste unique. It's not to be missed."}
{"text":"This is sushi and service at its finest, though you will pay for it. I'd suggest dressing up for this place. After dinner try the W hotel's rooftop bar."}
{"text":"Good sushi.  Retarded servers and infested with snobby young Scottsdale douche bags.

If i were to go again, I would go before the Snottsdale kids wake up and I would sit at the bar :-)"}
{"text":"Went here for Happy Hour with my daughter.  We didn't have our car so when I Yelped sushi restaurants on the strip, not many came up. I felt that the price was right for happy hour, the service was mediocre, but the food items were hit and miss.  Some were amazing and others were just \"meh.\" The California rolls were surprisingly bland. We had an amazing sashimi fish dish that was served with ponzu sauce and had some yummy, fried brown onions on top. It was so good we ordered another!  
Overall though, don't expect a lot from this place. Consistency throughout is what I look for in any restaurant and we were desperate for sushi so unfortunately I would say, we kind of settled.  We did feel satiated in the end because we got our sushi fix, but I won't ever go back again."}
{"text":"Stopped by, had a couple of rolls, a bit of salmon nigiri and some tuna poke, a beer and sparking water. 

Not bad, just like its franchise brethren here in LA, and one of the better sushi places in the Vegas hotels but at a price point that wont suggest you're actually in Tokyo."}
{"text":"Brussels Sprouts chips were good. Cosmopolitan was great! Spicy tuna roll was sort of good. Beef wrapped asparagus was great! Only thing that was unusual was when we were walking in and the staff was yelling out, but I suppose enough people like it to the point where it's become their \"thing\". The waitress was super nice especially considering the fact that she was working December 24th."}
{"text":"Do not under any circumstances try and get to this place by going through Caesers....you will go hungry :-(   We made that mistake and 40 minutes later, on foot, we finally found it.     At this point, it was worth it because we were frustrated, needed a drink and were super hungry after the unexpected workout.   That being said, they must get that often because they held our reservation or they just weren't that busy.   I'm guessing it's the latter.  In it's hey day, it was probably the talk of the town and it's still a nice restaurant with just a touch of over ambiance but they do offer gorgeous views of the strip.    The food was great  and priced really well if you need a sushi fix.   Our waitress was super nice and on top of the service.   We let her know that we were short on time and had to make a show.   She was attentive but not pushy and made sure we got our food timely.   Ask for recommendations on food because there are a number of special rolls that are available and not on the menu.   The Lotus roll in particular was very good.

There is seating by the windows and booths along the wall.   Ask for the booth because it is more comfortable and also a raised section, that's where the best view of the strip can be found."}
{"text":"This place is located on the 3rd level of the Cesar's Palace Shops.  It was a bit of a walk, but well worth it.  We were craving sushi, so we were looking at all the reviews on yelp and decided to give this place a try.  Came at about Noon on a Tuesday, so it wasn't busy at all. We ordered the following:

- Salmon sashimi - the color is a bright orange and the taste was so fresh.  Definitely a very good grade of sashimi.  It's buttery and melts in your mouth. 

- Cucumber roll - this was very good as well.  Most of the time cucumber rolls are just ok everywhere, but this was delicious. 

- Spicy Tuna roll - I love spicy tuna rolls and this one was very good.  Just enough tuna and spiciness to make it a great roll.

- Pork Belly Fried rice - my husband loved this and so did I.  The fried rice is already packed with flavors, but when you mix the pieces of pork belly with it, it adds an explosion in your mouth.  So delicious!

- Uni pasta - this one was very disappointing. I've had uni pasta before, but this one just tasted like an alfredo sauce with pieces of uni. 

Overall the sushi was great.  It's a bit pricey, so be prepared, but you get what you pay for.  Good sushi doesn't come cheap.  Staff was friendly and service was fast with the exception of my uni pasta.  That one took a little bit longer then everything else, but the server did prepare me for that.  I would definitely come back here for the fresh sushi and the fried rice next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We found this gem on Open Table and after checking reviews on Yelp, and decided to dine here while visiting for a conference. The three of us were very impressed by the quality of the sushi. The White Lotus roll was amazing, the albacore just melted in our mouths. The Tuna Jalapeno,Eel Avocado, garden roll, Curry and California roll were also just as amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the light and fruity cold sake. Will definitely be back when in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place more than 3 stars. But the service was the worst part of the experience. They serve happy hour all night on Sundays which made up for the bad service. I ordered a pear martini which took forever to get and it's even worst when you are trying to get the attention of someone to order a beverage or food. They were busy watching the football game, And avoiding the table. But the pear martini was delicious. The albacore salsa roll was very flavorful! We also ordered a few spicy salmon and spicy tuna roll. The Kobe slider with bacon jam was sooo good! Didn't expect that. Most defiantly recommend that on the happy our menu along with the albacore salsa roll. The tempera asparagus with aioli sauce was also not so good. Too thick and crunchy tempera almonds a more simple asparagus would have been better with the sauce. Overall I enjoyed the night but probably would only go back to try the main menu on a different day then Sunday, unless I'm up for happy hour and a pear martini."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant! Terrrific service! 

Wonderful, fresh and authentic cuisine - what more can I say but don't miss the Carpaccio!"}
{"text":"This is really only for the breakfast served at the W hotel...I didn't eat here during lunch or dinner...but bfast was good.  It's a little pricey, but the service is super friendly and the restaurant itself is nice.  Swanky.

It was uber convenient so all good with me."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped by during their happy hour. The bartender was real nice and held a good conversation. The sushi though was underwhelming. No real taste and left us unimpressed. Wouldn't stop here again but I imagine you could do worse."}
{"text":"I was part of the large group mentioned by another reviewer. I was lucky enough to get the undercooked chicken. I've been very ill since. The chicken was an appetizer and came as part of our tasting menu that the restaurant created for us. I'll never forget the experience because of my current state of hell. Thank you so much for trying to kill me."}
{"text":"Seriously....so glad we found this spot last year and returned during our week in Vegas. The happy hour is amazing and the bartenders they have now are cool. Good vibe in there for sure. Will return when we are back in town! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Vegas. We went to several sushi places in Vegas while we were there and this one was easily the best. The rolls were great and we went during their happy hour so they were also well priced. The food is fresh, the service is great and the location (view of the strip) was phenomenal."}
{"text":"I hate shopping because it makes me hungry. So, after a half a day of shopping at Forum Shops, we went to Sushi Roku. They have big tables and couches so you're not cramped/ feeling claustrophobic.

Since we weren't terribly hungry, we only ordered a few rolls/nigiri ($7-22 or market price): black truffle tempura handroll, salmon, albacore uni and tuna. We also ordered from the specials menu ($6-90). With a glass of Riesling in hand, we got...

Yellowtail-wrapped Foie Gras with Truffle Soy:
My eyes automatically scope out \"foie gras\" and \"truffle\" and send a signal to my taste buds that I'm about to have something amazing in my mouth. So amazing that my hands did not get a signal to take pictures. You'll just have to try it to know how beautiful this is. 5/5

Robata Style Japanese Wagyu Beef with Hawaiian Pink Salt:
You get a nice presentation of your skewer on its own robata grill and a spoon with pink rock salt. The wagyu is tender and fatty - feels nice on the tongue. The pink salt accentuates the flavor of the wagyu. 5/5

Scallop and Foie Gras Togarashi with Black Pepper and White Truffle Oil:
It's like a re-run of the first dish I had except this time, I got distracted by the black pepper taste. The scallops were perfectly cooked. 4/5

Blue Fin Tuna Sushi:
The fish was at the right temperature. The texture of the rice was just right. The fish to rice ratio was perfect. 5/5

Black Truffle Tempura Handroll:
This is wrapped in a thin soy paper. There's avocado inside. The truffle flavor is in the sauce. 4/5

The service was excellent. Our server was attentive."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch - great sushi (especially the Shima roll and the Tako roll) and nice view of the Las Vegas strip. The owner, Johnny Seo, made a point of coming round, talking with people, and really connecting. Rare you find someone as passionate and caring about his restaurant and guests. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great service great food it's almost as good Nobu minus the Ambience and 1/3 of the price  ... The staff was very knowledgeable staff... Their sashimi toro was very fresh...."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch in Scottsdale! Free valet parking, and you can also hang out at the pool upstairs afterwards. It's a great way to beat the heat! They have bento boxes for $10-$15. Can't beat a deal like that, especially since it is very fresh fish. Excellent sushi!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great sake selection. My new favorite place for sushi in Las Vegas. Ask for a table by the window. Great atmosphere easy to have a conversation but still overall good vibe.  Just simply cannot say enough good things. Try the Kim Chee."}
{"text":"One of the Best Sushi places in Vegas!  We went here for a friend's birthday and have returned twice because we can not stop thinking about it.  We ordered so much food, I tried almost everything on the menu and there was was nothing on the menu I didn't like.  The service was second to none and the food was an experience I will never forget.  The flavors and presentation are awesome.  If you have never been, go and if you have gone and weren't impressed go back and give it another try. . . this spot ROCKS!"}
{"text":"Meh. Came in for sushi after reading pretty good reviews. It just so happened to be happy hour score! They had 6 piece sushi rolls for 6 bucks cant beat that and specialty rolls 30% off. Tried two happy hour rolls and one tempura  spicy tuna roll. The tempura oddly enough tasted stale/old just not good at all. The other rolls one with rock shrimp and one with scallops. I didn't really care for the rock shrimp one like eat one piece and done. The scallop one wasnt awful. Overall really unimpressed. The bar tender was nice on a positive note."}
{"text":"The main reason I'm giving 5 stars is for the Bluefin Sashimi that they do topped with shaved black truffles, truffle oil, microgreens, and parmesan cheese. It's an unexpected flavor combo, but it is downright euphoric and should not be missed. I can actually say that this is the best sushi dish I've ever eaten and it's hard to go back to eating sashimi sans truffles. When Bluefin is not in season, you can get it with regular tuna or salmon and they are both amazing. It's not always on the menu, but if you ask, they'll make it. I've tried ordering this dish at other Sushi Roku locations, but instead of using shaved black truffles, they use a measely amount of these sorry crumbled truffle bits. It just doesn't compare.

The other 5 star dish is the Tempura Fried Green Tea Ice Cream. Its a chunk of ice cream encased in a little  spongecake \"box\" which is then dipped in tempura batter and deep fried. It's also topped with a little raspberry sauce drizzle and garnished with fresh berries. The cake insulates the ice cream so it doesn't melt when they fry it. Not only is the flavor outstanding, but the crunchy tempura combined with the softest spongecake I've ever had is pure heaven.

Some of the other dishes here are just kind of so-so and they are usually quite salty. I LOVE the spicy tuna on crispy rice at Katsu-ya, so when I saw that item on the menu here, I was excited to try it. Unfortunately theirs is extremely greasy so be prepared to blot the hell out of it."}
{"text":"My family and I have dined at Sushi Roku on a few occasions and have had the pleasure of having \"Bianca\" as our waitress almost every time. She has always delivered excellent service & is great at recommending items to fit our taste buds. Whether it be a glass of Kistler Chardonnay...or our newfound favorite Yuzu Salmon Roll. She even spoke to the chefs to have them add jalapeños to our roll when we wanted a little \"kick.\" Overall, Sushi Roku has great food, ambiance, & excellent service due to employees like Bianca."}
{"text":"Great location, ambiance, and food...who would have thought you could get quality sushi in the desert???

Yes it's more California style sushi vs. traditional but more mass appeal for a place like Scottsdale.  Baked lobster roll was absolutely delicious.  Spent about $200 for 4 people, but we did have sake, wine and beer to go with our meal.  Would gladly come back."}
{"text":"The server was a bit arrogant when we tried to order dessert after we paid our bill....Bento box lunch was OK...the fresh sushi rolls tasted somewhat better. Just disappointing for the location of this restaurant."}
{"text":"We used to love this place and would have previously rated 5/5 but our most recent experience was horrendous food. 

I'm wondering if there is new ownership?  Regardless stay clear, our group of 6 Connoisseurs was horrified by the food. At one point my wife actually spit out the Lobster roll. We paid our $500 left and went to eat. 

I complained to the hostess on the way out but she didn't really seem to care."}
{"text":"My friend and I had time to kill before she had to go in to work. We stopped by Sushi Roku since it was close to our work. On Fridays, their happy hour ends earlier than the rest of the week. Monday through Thursday, it goes until 7pm. On Friday, it ends at 6pm.

Since we missed the happy hour by a few minutes, we still decided to grab a bite at the bar. The mushroom tempura is, by far, the best item on the menu. Light batter, fried crispy, and tossed in truffle aioli makes for the perfect snack. The miso black cod is also very delicious. The fish flakes into beautiful slivers. The octopus carpaccio is not as tender as I would hope. It pales in comparison to the first two dishes.

Now I need to sneak away at a decent time to attend their happy hour."}
{"text":"really great seaweed salad. not too salty like i've had in the past. mama liked her sashimi with eel sauce.they had kirin on tap. very sophisticated looking spot. we only did bar service. bartender was helpful even when we had to return an item. didn't see too much spit on it. 

nice location in the \"mall\"."}
{"text":"EXCEPTIONAL

I haven't had better sushi or service in town. This restaurant is inside the W Hotel in Scottsdale. You can park in the hotel parking or there is easy to find free street parking right outside. 

I came here for a friend's birthday dinner. The ambiance was perfect. The 5 of us sat comfortably in their round booths. There were plenty of other parties in the restaurant but honestly, didn't even feel like they were around. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and personable. There was never a time our glasses were not full, recommendations were amazing, and never a dull or awkward or intrusive moment when he came by to check on us. He always seemed to have perfect timing.

As for the food, we ordered a little bit of everything: cold and hot appetizers, steak, wagyu beef, sushi, sashimi, and sake. The fish is so fresh! The amount you pay, is definitely for quality. My favorite has got to the the wagyu beef and toro. Second was the oysters and chocolate lava cake.

Nothing negative comes to mind when I think for Sushi Roku. If you are looking for quality Japanese food and a good night out, this is your place.

Tip: Monday night - 50% off bottles"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker I have a pretty high standard when it comes to sushi. I found Sushi Roku to be a good spot for anyone visiting Scottsdale. The food was great - try the special rolls and the service outstanding. We selected a roll that we didn't like, they were quick to comp us (despite us not asking) and the manager stopped by to check on us. I found this refreshing. Seems like a good spot for groups."}
{"text":"Decent prices, King crab rice a must have, seaweed salad was real good. I wasn't happy with the fried calamari. The salmon dinner was awesome. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I came here again this past weekend for Valentine's Day and had to write an update because our waitress Erin was just so great. And also, they DO still offer a 20% local discount! Just not on holidays. I did not like the R'eye cocktail, but Erin switched it for me to a Salary Man which is the same one I had last time. I still LOVE their crispy rice with spicy tuna (it's called something else there) and their baked crab hand roll. We ordered the Katana Roll, Tuna Jalapeno Roll, and Baked Lobster Roll and all were delicious, our favorite was the Tuna Jalapeno. We didn't have dessert but next time I want to try the cinnamon donuts, Erin said they are awesome. Can't wait to come back for another date night and use our local discount!"}
{"text":"It is a very nice place to go and have a great ambiance, but I don't think the cost defines the food. The sushi and sashime are very fresh and good, but nothing you can't find for cheaper and with equal quality. Service was very friendly and professional with great recommendations."}
{"text":"Trendier/Fancier sushi restaurant located at the far end of Caesar's Palace. It's a hike to get here from hotel registration, just FYI folks.

DO:
-Order any of the rolls here. They are all very delicious! The fish is fresh here.
-Order yourself a cocktail, something with Sake is preferable. However, my colleagues did order themselves a few Lychee Martinis that were apparently superb.

DON'T:
-Expect the best service when they are packed with diners. Your food will come out in time. No worries. Just make sure your cocktail gets to you before the hangry mood sets in."}
{"text":"After spending the morning at the pool, I needed to run an early afternoon errand to pickup some tailored items I bought as the Forum shops the previous day. The four of us were hungry and decided to grab something right inside the Forum shops. I valeted and was pleased to find most of the food joints on that end of the mall. We all had seen the Sushi Roku sign from the strip so decided to give it a try.

The sushi was off only mediocre quality, at best. For that quality, it was extremely overpriced. Each of us only had one cut roll (I also had one hand roll) and the bill came to $120 for four people.

I can't tell you where else to grab sushi in the Forum Shops, but there are plenty of more cost-effective options in there. I'd suggest Spagos (near the entrance to the casino on the second level)."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but well worth it!

The views at night are pretty cool as you can see the strip all lighted up....the sushi is delicious and the Kobe is a must!  

They bring you the raw meat out in thin slices (about 6 slices I think?) and you cook it at your table so you can eat it fresh off the heated rock!  

The service is top notch, very attentive and ready to answer any questions you have.  It also helps that the servers are pretty attractive, pretty people only please.  =P   Yes, it's one of those places in LV, like many....you're there to be seen and look cute.

The ambiance, food and service are all right on....really romantic and fun...you won't be disappointed...a nice stop after a day of shopping at the Palace.  =)"}
{"text":"Wow THIS is Japanese food at its best. Don't be fooled by its location in a tourist trap mall, this place is excellent and is a must try if you want a Japanese lunch. I had the beef bento box which came with some of the best beef I've had anywhere and tasty California rolls, a salad with ginger dressing, and a huge portion of rice. Try the beef here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped by randomly for lunch this weekend with a girlfriend, and it turned out to be the highlight of our day. Our server, Rob, was excellent and super knowledgeable about the menu. He gave us some great suggestions - all delicious! Definitely try the wrapped asparagus, grilled salmon, tuna tartare, and the mochi is the perfect dessert. Everything was spot on, I couldn't be more pleased :)"}
{"text":"Awesome view awesome sushi. priced on the high end but quality is top notch. our server was great. the service is A+. great place to take a date or with friends."}
{"text":"It's hard to give a place in Vegas that does it as big as Sushi Roku any less than five stars. It just doesn't work.

If you are a sushi, sashimi, whatever-i fan - this place has it all, you will not get it as good as you get it here, unless you cross the pond to japan. From the excellent food, to the exclusive sake that they serve, you know you're getting a one-of-a-kind experience here.

The service is excellent, and if you're there for work (boo-yah! expense that junks!) and you can splurge, they know when you're spending money, and you'll find your dessert comped if they can tell that you are dropping some dollars.

Ask for Kenji if you want to feel super duper cool and VIP. Tell him the place came highly recommended by a friend from New York, and you were told to make sure you give him their best. Joke, laugh, exchange business cards. It'll be the cherry on top of the whole experience.

As much as I hate Vegas, it's places like Sushi Roku that make me love Vegas.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience.  Jenna was our server.  Food was outstanding and Manager Kyle was attentive and top notch!!  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Very impressive.

We had a lot of Nigiri tuna (and blue fin tuna) as well as some halibut and the crunchy spiy tuna with avocado (this was tempura, misleading dish name)

I had beer, girl a martini, some edamame to start, as well as some of the BEST miso soup I have had.  Seemed fresh and was delicious.

Would recommend to anyone who likes sushi.  The view of the strip was awesome, even though I had my back to it (gave the nice view to the girlfriend)"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with friends after a local recommended it. Fabulous view of the strip with great lunch specials.  The server was very friendly and efficient. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came to Sushi Roku while on a trip to Vegas. It was our first stop on our 3 day trip and we had a great time. The truffle oil edamame had good flavor and was different than what we typically order. Our waiter recommended the Yellowtail diced chilis appetizer and I thought it was perfect! My fiance did not care for it but he enjoyed the sushi. I felt the sushi was average. Our waiter was very helpful and professional. We also requested for a window seat to look out over the strip which they accommodated. We had a great time and will be returning on our next trip!"}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour for Sushi on the strip. Customer service is on point, everyone is super friendly and go out of their way to accommodate you. Sushi is fresh and delicious. We come here for happy hour every time we come to Vegas. Enjoy the view at night. SUSHI ROKU ROCKS!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sure there are other great sushi spots in Vegas, but, if it ain't broke...

The most recent trip to Sushi Roku is 4-star worthy, just like all the others. Wonderful sake and lots of different sushi selections. I still stand behind the spicy tuna hanabi and filet-wrapped asparagus. I'll also add the seaweed salad to the list of winners at Sushi Roku.

Service was super friendly as always, and the nigiri and sashimi was very tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.  I love the chic atmosphere, the fresh sushi, and the great views of the Strip.  Wonderful spot to people-watch.  

Tip:  The $19 lunch specials are an excellent value."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times before & always loved what I got. I'm not a huge fan of the prices as it's NOT cheap (that's the only reason I took 1 star away from my review). But the quality is pretty good & the drinks are strong (just wish they were bigger!). I love the decor & ambience here.

On my last visit here (mid-Jan 2012, on a Saturday), I went for a late lunch (around 2-3pm), got the Shima Roll with a side of Edamame. Ate these with a Grey Goose with a splash of Sprite. Very yummy, wish I had gotten another roll because it was very tasty.

Server was so nice, very warm & friendly. Hostess was also super nice.

Sort of funny story: I was seated on the end of 1 row of tables, on the booth part of the table. 2 guys were on the opposite end of my row. The guy sitting on the booth part kept shaking his leg or something, which caused the row to shake a bit ... along with me attempting to eat my sushi!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Stylish, sleek, authentic
Food: fresh seafood, melts in the mouth
Presentation: fabulous
Service: very attentive and knowledgeable
Price: high but reasonable for what you get

The three of us (my dad, my husband and myself) had miso soups, a garden salad to share,  2 sets of sushi rolls (we had to go for a second of the baked crab roll -  sooo good), octopus sushi,  2 plates of Chef's Sashimi combination, and a carafe of sake.  Oh, and don't forget to go for their deserts!!  We had mochi (strawberry, espresso and mango). Espresso was by all means our favorite. Very rich in flavor and don't be surprised if you leave your plates crystal clean :) 

For our dinner, we paid close to $270 (with tips, taxes). High, but something worth the experience.

Bon appetite.

{"text":"Nice restaurant all the time we come to Vegas wait over there with a friend with a family where they get the seven is the weather is amazing the guys over there is very good the food is very good and I enjoyed to eat over there I'm going to arrive to Vegas"}
{"text":"Ok I went here once before just thought it was OK. But I just tried it again and was pleasantly surprised.  The only thing that wasn't stellar was our server, but she was OK, so we left her 15% all the same.  This place is on the third floor of Caesar's Forum shops next store to BOA.

a) Foie Gras topped scallops $21 AWESOME, we ordered another round of these they were that good
b) yellowtail and jalapeno sashimi platter really good and lots of it
c) lychee martinis --yum yum
d) Great view of the Las Vegas strip :) 
e) regular sushi rolls very good as well
f) great music
g) nice ambiance
h) availability to book online quickly makes me happy too!"}
{"text":"I had some time to kill after my meeting got out. Nobu wasn't open for lunch so I decided to give this place a try. I had the restaurants two signature dishes: a sashimi sampler that included Toro and Sea Urchen and a roll. Both were amazing. I capped it off with their signature cheese cake, which come wrapped in cotton candy and is lit on fire. Also very good. 

I only gave it 4 stars because although the foot was good, my bill came to $100 with tip (with green tea and miso soup). I thought he price was a hair steep for what I got. But a great experience nonetheless."}
{"text":"Sushi roku is one of my favorite sushi restaurant in the US. If you are in Vegas you must try this place inside the Forum shops at Caesars Palace. The sushi chefs are Masters creating some of the most creative and delicious dishes you will ever eat. The fish is super fresh and they have some really great specialty rolls. The crunchy tuna roll was excellent as was the salmon egg sushi and get this octopus suction cups filled with sake. Sashimi was great especially the scallops....very fresh.  Go figure being in the desert."}
{"text":"Kyle H. is amazing - request his section!! Came here during their anniversary week, so 50% off all food... heaven!! Kyle was attentive the entire meal and his recommendations were amazing! Shishito peppers, yellow tail app and crispy spicy tuna on point!! Fun atmosphere and great food!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a fancy contemporary Japanese restaurant with extremely beautiful ambiance. The menu is quite large, with some traditional items, fancy, unhealthy rolls, as well as a couple of entrees as well. I tried the kobe beef skewers that was a bit overcooked to me. Perhaps that was their take on it, but I definitely think that kobe is best cooked to the minimal. I was not too impressed. The slow cooked pork dish with rice however, was delicious! The pork was so tender and the sauce was amazing. I would definitely have that dish again! Great view of the strip as well, and the service was decent but not the best. Pricing is decent for a nicer restaurant like this. Solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"I typically don't venture into old town in the evening, but went to Sushi Roku for a client dinner. The atmosphere was really fun, and the food was great. I actually don't eat Sushi, but everyone at my table said it was incredible. I got a filet and it was great."}
{"text":"Really dug the vibe of Sushi Roku. Good decor and music. Hip vibe. Services was good. We had some yellowtail sashimi for an appetizer. It was very good. For my meal I had Hanabi off the appetizer menu that the waitress recommended and a signature roll. I didn't like the sauce that topped the roll at all. The hanabi was ok.  The person I was with loved his food.  He had the seabass and a roll. I'd give this place a second shot but would stick with the more traditional stuff I know.  I also had their gun blossom cocktail. It was delish!"}
{"text":"Happy hour was excellent! The spicy tuna and California roll were delicious and just $6/each. Service was on point!  This is what I call a happy hour!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places i have ever been to in my life!  This is honestly not an exaggeration as I tend to do that at times.  I was only in Vegas for three nights and I came here two out of the three.  Highly recommend and absolutely everything we ordered was amazing.  There was a special crunch spicy roll that was to die for."}
{"text":"I went here for their happy hour and it was a great deal. The sushi for happy hour were basic rolls, but the fish tasted fresh and good. They have a more extensive menu that seems delicious! The happy hour was fantastic though, 3 rolls and a beer for around $20. Decor is nice. I went here after walking all around Las Vegas and sat at the bar. I felt a little uncomfortable in my shorts, sneakers and casual shirt so I recommend looking fairly decent and not like a tourist a Disneyworld like me!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group so we tried a bit of everything. We ordered multiple rolls and there's really not much to critique here. The sushi was fresh. There wasn't an overwhelming amount of rice. And overall, they were good portion sizes. 

What I did love was this crispy spicy shrimp that they offered. It was lightly friend shrimp so it didn't make you feel full and bloated with unnecessary carbs. And the shrimp were whole pieces instead of the cheap \"popcorn\" type. It was a good portion for sharing and we even placed another order because it was so good!

After that, we headed upstairs to their rooftop lounge. One thing I love about Scottsdale is the dry heat. Even though it was 80+ degrees out, it was so refreshing to be outside sipping on a cocktail.  The space is huge! It's great for a wedding/group outing of 50+ people. If I worked in the area, this would definitely be the spot I'd choose for happy hour :)"}
{"text":"Lovely little spot. I ventured out for a solo dinner while friends were snoozing. 

While I am a vegetarian, I cheated with a few seafood items while in Vegas, and Sushi Roku was one. I went with a sashimi app ($26 for eight pieces) and a spicy tuna roll (with add ons). 

I agree that it was overpriced, but the service and location were stellar. I do wish they'd had a larger selection of specialty rolls.

The fish was of seriously impressive quality - it was worth my one-time cheat. 

Back to vegetarianism, now and forever!"}
{"text":"Sushi Roku is easily the best sushi spot in Scottsdale. In addition to the wonderful flavors, the service is top notch. I'm writing this review because our server, Jon, gave my friend and I astounding service. He gave us a variety of recommendations and really helped us through the menu as it was our first time. All of our food came out perfectly and tasted even better. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh fish and extraordinary side dishes - don't miss the crispy Brussels sprouts.  The service was efficient and accommodating to requests; highly recommended"}
{"text":"Sophisticated and fun atmosphere with excellent food and service. The manager and waitstaff were attentive and engaging. Really great place for a date night or girls night."}
{"text":"Have come here a number of times and always great sushi.  We have always stuck to our usual orders but chose to venture out tonight with Julia as our server.  We couldn't have been more pleased with both her suggestions and her service!  She made this the best experience!"}
{"text":"Beautiful sushi, classy ambience and service was good.  Pricey, but it should be given the quality of food."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku stakes claim to an amazing ambiance. The modern vibe and styling of the W Hotel that Roku is located in, carried over and translated very well into the restaurant. I loved the upscale and hip vibe! My party and I decided to each order a roll... We're from California and are spoiled with our fresh seafood. There was a question mark on how the sushi in Scottsdale would compare to that of the bay area. Everyone was VERY pleased with both the portion sizes and the quality. The lobster roll was a table favorite. For dessert, we ordered the dessert spring rolls. They were amazing!!!!!!! Um... think spring roll filled with berries. banana, and paired with vanilla ice cream. Now, imagine what heaven would taste like, and there was our rolls!

Next time I find myself in Scottsdale, I would absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable meal.  The only way to go imo is to do the omakase at the sushi bar.  That way you're literally salivating at what's coming up next.  Call ahead and make sure Kichi is the chef that night.  Every course is like heaven.  Comes to about $90/per person not including alcohol and would gladly spend that again anytime my friends want a fantastic sushi dinner on the strip."}
{"text":"Ehhhhh.... its okay.

Gots to give it to them for the decor and ambience they've got going on.  The service was fabulous and they checked on us, refilled our drinks and what not.  

I had a bento box with spicy tuna sushi rolls and the food for some reason tasted mediocre to me.  

But what really impress me about this joint is that the decor was very nice, but I hate it when I go to a restaurant where the food isn't up to par with the restaurant though.  I like the factor that they used real bamboo as their coverings in the window as tourists would walk by, and the atmosphere was very relaxed and somber like.  

I wouldn't mind coming back here, but I just think that you could've found a better place compare to here.  Its just overrated."}
{"text":"Overpriced and average food.  The service was surprisingly slow for the restaurant not being busy.  I doubt I will done there again."}
{"text":"View was awesome. Sushi so so. Do not order the toro. Lmao quite the rip off. Other then that it was a fun place"}
{"text":"Was excited to try Sushi Roku for the first time, and let me tell you I was NOT impressed and was very disappointed.  Customer service was great but the food, nothing to rave about.  If you come here, you are paying for the name.  

We came here for lunch so it was a slow afternoon.  We got a table right away without a reservation.  Ordered a $6 miso soup (since I was feeling under the weather) and it sucked...nothing special for such an expensive soup. The tuna sashimi...delicious; the rolls....terrible and bland.  DO NOT come here for the rolls!  The drinks were just okay.  If you are looking for overpriced sushi, then come here."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Friday night as part of a group of fourteen from Vision Expo and the food and service was excellent! The friendly, professional service staff brought out many unique, tasty dishes and all of us walked away very satisfied. We were seated in a private area that looked out on the Strip, which created a very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The flavors were great in the rolls we ordered, and it was very clear the quality of the fish was high and fresh.  However I wish especially in the specialty rolls that there was a better balance and variety in texture. When a roll is specially designed like that it is always nice for me to have an element of crispness or crunch that was not present in the majority of the sushi we ordered.  We had two of the gin specialty drinks in the menu and they were extremely refreshing!  Lovely, aromatic mixtures though the cucumber garnish was not in great condition.  Ambiance was nice -- competition with Tao it would seem.     Our server as well was sweet though it seemed he was a but overwhelmed... It took him a while to get our last roll to us, and he double checked with us on the order at least 5 mins after he should have already punched it in.  Overall,  I might not dine here again because it was extremely expensive, and I'd rather explore other Vegas options."}
{"text":"I wish I could say something. Anything. But, all I got is nothing, because that's what I got before I left the most craptastic table known to mankind.

I never heard of this place before until a friend suggested that I go because they were having their 5 year anniversary special. If I liked it, my job was to report back to my entire sorority so they could try it out on another day and we would be a group of happy fatties. If I didn't, at least I didn't pay full price. My sister and I were pumped to go as it would be a new experience in Old Town. My phone was charged; I was gonna take an ungodly amount of photos of my food. I called to make reservations and they told me that they had limited tables and I would be at a high-top table. I'm not usually one for such seating but I understood that they would be packed so I took it with joy and excitement.

I got there early and checked-in with the hostess who said that my table was ready and all they had to do was clean it. You know the feeling when they lead you to a table next to the kitchen entrance, the bathroom, or some reckless child throwing spaghetti who needs to be tied up Silence of the Lambs style? Well, let me challenge that.

They had moved a high-top table from the bar area into the lit walkway where everyone walked in and out, but pushed it toward the wall where there was absolutely no light. I thought Cornish Pasty was dark, but where it was placed, I needed to turn my phone on just to talk to my sister across the little 2 ft. wide table. You could tell that a table wasn't supposed to be put there because well ... it was a walkway. If a party of more than 4 was coming through, one of us would definitely be bumped into. It only had 2 chairs, 2 settings but I reserved for 3. They said they knew and would set it up, even though I looked and the table was already clean and set? We waited for about 20 minutes and finally hunger overtook my sister who got up and asked if we could sit down. They told the same excuse to us they told everyone else 'We're waiting for some tables to move.\" My hopes for a better table soared like an American Eagle, but not another second longer did they shut down my dreams like the government. They pointed to the same table, and we awkwardly sat down ... while my boyfriend stood up waiting for the chair they still hadn't placed. There were at least 4 employees standing at the hostess podium, 2 feet away, just walking around my boyfriend like he had suddenly turned into stone. 

The chair came 5 minutes later, but only because of my boyfriend's invisible yet oh so intense laser beam eyes gored into the back of their heads. No menus were given to us the entire time we sat. Once again, we are sitting so close to the hostess podium, I could play patty-cake with them. Then we waited until our server came, who immediately told us that we couldn't sit there if we were just waiting for a table, and that we would have to excuse ourselves to the bar area. 

That was pretty much the last straw. Not even cheap Chili's would give this kind of rude service. My sister told her that we were her table but we were leaving. I walked the 2 steps over to the 4 hosts who looked baffled as to why we was leaving, but even a 3 year old watching Dora could have figured it out quicker than them.

We left and walked over to HiFi disgruntled, but even there we got better service even with the unwanted boobies all up in our faces. 

Basically, I am appalled at what happened. I understand that you're packed with such an awesome special going on but lord did they over-estimate the crowd, taking reservations when they shouldn't have, giving tables to customers that not even a cave troll would deserve, and the lack of communication between the front of the house and the dining floor. People go out of their way to try new places and if you can't be organized without being blinded by profit, why should we as customers waste gas just to be shafted. We left so frustrated and sad, not even getting the slightest chance to try anything that we had drooled over previously through Yelp photos. Not even a freaking glass of water."}
{"text":"Food was good, happy hour prices were a little steep for the quality of sushi. I got a simple California roll, and it wasn't too special, wanted cream cheese inside, she brought it to me on the side ? Argggggg. The waitress wasn't very attentive I was going to order a bottle of wine for the table, or at least a glass for me, and couldn't find her, you would think if we were the ONLY ones at the bar she would be able to help us 100%..nopppeeee. Maybe I should try something more innovative next time I may like it."}
{"text":"Wife and I visited the W Scottsdale for dinner, it is a party scene, restaurant is quite loud and happening. The sushi was really good. The service was a 3 of 5. Bachelor parties next to us, some real broskis looking to get turnt! Food was really good though, if you are looking for a party scene with good sushi this is your spot, not a quiet dinner with your grandmother."}
{"text":"Sushi was good. The seaweed salad was really good. This was the most expensive sushi place I have dined at. Good view of the strip if you sit near the window."}
{"text":"Love this place and its location!!! I always have the best dining experiences at sushi roku. The atmosphere of the restaurant is perfect for a date night, girls night out, or any other fun occasion. The food is fresh, fun, and DELICIOUS!! My favorite thing on the menu is probably the seared salmon sashimi appetizer. I love the smores dessert too. I've tried a variety of dishes on the menu and loved them all. Our waiter Jon was amazing. He was attentive, polite, and gave us great suggestions on what to order. Sushi roku continues to impress me, and I'm sure I'll be back soon. Shoutout to the super awesome and thoughtful manager Mike too!"}
{"text":"Not bad, yet not too impressed to be coming back. We came here for happy hour and sat belly up at the bar. We ordered from a few items on the menu as well as the happy hour menu. The fried rice was way to greasy and salty for my taste. We also ordered the oysters and they tasted okay but had a little fishy after taste.
The service was  not bad at all, but I wanted this sushi joint to make my taste buds dance and unfortunately it didn't accomplish that.
Sorry Sushi Roku, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Great service

Halibut sashimi 9.5/10
Lobster duo 8/10
Wagyu potsticker 7/10 nothing special
Edamame 7/10 ordinary
Sake sampler 10/10
Katana roll 8/10
Eel and avocado roll 7/10"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! The Katana roll is amazing! It is a little pricey but considering what my husband and I paid at Tao- it's not bad. The atmosphere is wonderful, very romantic and unlike Tao- we didn't have to yell to hear each other or feel like we were in a high school cafeteria. WE WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"By the time that I got off the plane in Las Vegas, I was already starving. After dropping our luggage off in our rooms, we promptly took to yelp to find some sushi for my poor landlocked friend. We ended up at Sushi Roku and had a pleasant lunch. We each ordered iced teas. The iced tea had some sort of fruit flavor that we couldn't place. It wasn't sweet, but you could taste something tropical. 
I opted for the lunch special which included salmon teriyaki, salad, rice and sashimi. I also added a miso soup. My friend ordered a specialty roll and a seaweed salad. My expectations were actually kind of low (this place is inside a mall) and they were easily surpassed by this lunch. The miso soup was flavorful and served at an appropriate temperature. My friends salad was really delicious. It was made with the very dark green seaweed and not the weird neon kind. My salad was pretty generic and with the exception of fishing out and munching on the the bitter micro-greens, I basically left it untouched. My sashimi was ok. Nothing really special. It could've been a bit colder. My salmon teriyaki was very flavorful, but a tiny bit overcooked. The rice on the plate was plain steamed rice. It was exactly as expected. My friends roll looked pretty good, but towards the end, she just took it apart and ate the fish because the ratio of rice to other ingredients was too high.   
Not a terrible lunch, but also not the best I've ever eaten. It was definitely OK."}
{"text":"Fresh uni with a sashimi platter of the chefs choice was amazing. The saltiness of the ocean laid nicely on my palette with a cool and light sake to wash it down. This place is never a disappointment if you're on a quest for great seafood."}
{"text":"I've had a handful of sushi places in Vegas. Perhaps from all of the bad experiences my expectations were low...but bar none, this is the best I've had (in Vegas). The sushi was very good, wait staff was friendly."}
{"text":"We had a late afternoon reservation but not late enough. They only opened the seating area with a view at 5:00pm. We didn't make a big fuss. We had a very attentive and friendly waiter. Service was quick and the food was good. The only issue we had was their system didn't accept our American Express Serve card even though the funds were available."}
{"text":"Very Swanky Restaurant!  The sushi was decent and the cost moderate.  I had the seaweed salad, spicy tuna roll and asparagus/spicy shrimp roll.  Spicy tuna was definitely the best of all three dishes.  I'm not sure what kind of spices are in the roll, but it's definitely very good.

I would go back."}
{"text":"Once again, for sushi restaurants all I gotta say is OMAKASE!!!

The $95 omakase at Sushi Roku kind of gave me a mini heart attack because you never know what you're gonna get....I've heard of Sushi Roku before, but didn't check out the reviews for it before going in. So this was either going to be really good, or really crappy!

Apologies ahead of time for the lack of details, as it was on a girls weekend to Vegas that I dined here, and as with any Vegas trip - details are a bit blurry!!!

This is what our omakase came with:

kobe beef

foie gras wrapped in toro (i think it was toro)

fantastic tuna sashimi (sorry, can't remember exaclty what kind)

miso halibut (or was it cod...regardless it was so good, it melted in your mouth!)

sushi plate of various oceanic delights

mini chocolate souffle

Service was great, ambiance was great, my only complaint - they need to carry magnum size sake! For five girls a magnum liter sized sake bottle would have put this dinner over the top, but we managed to tame ourselves and ordered only one bottle and cocktails..  : - )

Overview: Omakase - do it!

Tip:  This is in the shops at Caesar's, at the beginning rotunda, third floor."}
{"text":"Ordered using Uber eats, delivery took about 1 hour which was fine. I ordered miso soup, crab fried rice, and shrimp tempura roll. The portion of soup was very small for the price. The fried rice was really good, the roll had cream cheese in it which I didn't really care for.  I would order from this place again when I am too lazy to drive."}
{"text":"The shrimp tempura and asparagus roll is one of the best things I have ever tasted. California roll was pretty good, but where was the cucumber? Heirloom tomato roll was... weird. But I can't really fault them for that, I think my tastebuds just weren't used to such weirdness. Jess said the salmon sushi was delectable. I'd maybe give this place 3.5 stars normally, but I'll bump them to 4 because I'm in a good mood."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and it never disappoints. The food is incredible no matter what you chose and the staff is friendly and service is great. I'm a foodie and a sushi/Asian aficionado and this ranks pretty high.  I recommend it highly. Check out my photos and see why I have high marks. Not only did it look good it tasted great."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the highlights in my trip in Las Vegas.

The seared salmon with ponzu sauce melted in my mouth & I loved it. The Wagyu skewer was cooked to perfection... and it was very tasty. We also had the salmon nigiri, wagyu gyoza, a handroll, & pork belly fried rice. The pork belly was delicious.

Overall, this place is one of the finest sushi place I've ever been to. I really liked the interior as well.
Service was great, so that's definitely a plus."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Very fresh food and solid service. The beer list was good too. I had never had or seen Asahi Black before. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"We made reservations to come here for dinner. It seemed like a high end sushi place. I had the organic salad and spicy miso. I enjoyed the spicy miso. And that organic salad is definitely organic. We had the hanabi \"crispy rice\" for appetizers and you definitely should try it. It's really yummy. As for the sushi. I wasn't super impressed, but it was good. Usually I stay for dessert at restaurants, but I felt like the atmosphere made me feel uncomfortable. It felt like the workers were a little judgmental, as if we didn't have money to eat there or tip. Which is untrue. I would never go to a place and not have money for either. So ya I didn't get to try their desserts."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. 

I came here with a group of girlfriends for one of their birthdays. Each time we ordered a new glass of wine, it took at least 20 min to come out, one of our appetizers was the very last item to come out (about 2 and a half hours after we ordered), and the wrong order was brought to our table at least 6 times. We had to wave down multiple bussers just to get any type of service, and although the manager comped a round of drinks, both the server and managers seemed to want us to just get frustrated enough to leave. 

And the cherry on top is that we refused the dessert that we had originally requested since it was a birthday celebration, so instead they brought us a round of shots. We didn't ask for these, nor did we want them as all we wanted to do was get out of there and end our terrible experience. The entire tray of shots was spilled on one of the girls at our table, and to our party it was hysterical after the horrendous dining experience we endured, however, the person who spilled them should not have been laughing like he was. 

Our entire bill should have been comped and I probably wouldn't be writing this. I reached out to the GM, and gave him a chance to rectify this situation but apparently he could care less about his customers experiences just as his employees. It's no wonder where they get it. 

All in all, I would never recommend this restaurant, or go back. If you want mediocre sushi and terrible service then you'll probably be fine, but I expected much more from a restaurant associated with the W hotel."}
{"text":"Amazing!!  Great atmosphere and unbelievable service!! Bianca was out server and she rocked!  Blue fin Tuna, fluke sashimi were some of our favorites. What a great spot and amazing service. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Tuesday night after hoofing it through the Forum shops for a while. Super friendly hostess met us at the door and walked us past the sushi bar where all the chefs hollered out a welcome.

Loved the decor--dark, rich, invitingly modern and warm without being dreary. Never having been here before, what did we do? A little of everything. Edamame beans as well as edamame hummus served with wonton crisps. Husband had salad with a delightful peanut-based dressing; I had crab miso soup that was good, but not worth the money. Better off just ordering standard miso soup.

Then came the rolls. A spicy tuna with a serious kick, and very good flavors. But my favorite? The Takana roll, which was draped with the most perfect, buttery yellowtail I have ever had in my life. It melted with each bite, and was the highlight of the meal...so much so that when we finally launched into our baked lobster roll, I did the unthinkable--I sent it back. It was positively bland and flavorless compared to the Takana roll, and was a real let-down following that amazing yellowtail. The manager, Gary Min, came over and removed it without batting an eye, and was incredibly gracious and accommodating from beginning to end. Our waitress, Tina, was also delightful, and very helpful and present without being overbearing.

Overall, a really good meal. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went in the other night to check this place out with my wife, hands down best sushi in the valley.  The manager brought us an order of their Pork Belly on top of crispy rice, the sauce was amazing to compliment such a well rounded dish.  Energy in the building is awesome to see in person.  The sushi quality is like nothing you will find in the valley.  I forgot to get our servers name but she was a lovely young lady!  We finished off the night with after dinner cocktails, the list gave us quite the choice to pick from.  I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a good sushi dinner.  Amazing.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I came here after shopping in the forum shops and have to say the day I dined in all the fish were very fresh. It's a bit pricey, but the atmosphere is nice and if you're craving sushi after shopping this is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere here is definitely a 5, especially if you like the swanky/loungey type place. 

Service was decent.

However, considering the atmosphere and the price, the food does not come close to matching. We started with the shishito peppers and the tuna rice cracker, which were both pretty good. Then, we had 2 rolls, which were unnecessarily jazzed up with extra sauces/oils and the flavor was fair at best. We also had the ribeye, which actually was quite tough and fatty and pretty low quality considering the steep price.

All in all, this place is a nice destination if you are seeking atmosphere; however, if you are a foodie and are expecting a quality meal to match the steep price, you may be sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"So I came here with a friend for happy hour after wanting to come for happy hour for a long time. The deals seemed very good, almost too good. Turns out that they sort of are. They have tasty drinks for cheap, which are definitely a good deal. I had some drink that was fizzy and had fresh strawberries in it... very tasty indeed. My friend and I split two apps, the tostada sort of thing with raw sushi on it and the pork belly on top of the rice cake, on special for 6$ each. They both sounded good and were recommended by the bartender. The tuna tostada was ok, but overwhelmed by a huge amount of pureed avocado. The portions were a little on the small side. Neither of us would order that again. The pork belly thing, on the other hand, was crazy delicious... I would definitely get it again, but the portion was small... like two bites. Anyway, I would go back for happy hour, but it might not be my first choice."}
{"text":"We were staying at the W this week for a local conference, so decided to eat here on Sunday night. We live in San Francisco & love Roka Akor, but wanted to try something different. We loved it! The yellowtail sashimi was melt-in-your-mouth delicious & all the specialty rolls we had were great too. And oh! Don't forget the toro tartare! Ermegawd, I was in heaven. The waiter we had was super nice, very attentive & even scored us a free dessert, as he overheard us mention our anniversary was coming up in the next month or so. Sunday nights are a great time to dine here, as all wine & sake by the bottle is 1/2 price! So we had some sweet M &C for a great price. In addition, on Sundays in their bar, they have an all-night Happy Hour stating at 4pm. The drinks were tasty, albeit kinda weak ( not a surprise) but the food was really good & generous portions for only $5 per plate. So we came here after a day of lounging at the pool..then went back to our room, napped, showered, came back for dinner 4-5 hours later. Good times. :)"}
{"text":"I can't remember when I've actually spit out my food because it was so bad, but that's what happened to me with Sushi Roku's tofu.  I had ordered their \"premium homemade tofu\" three ways (truffles, caviar and lemon oil, scallions and sesame oil).  The tofu had this sourness that concerned me about its freshness...and then I literally spit out the truffle tofu because it had a rotten taste to it!  Bleh!!  

I wasn't expecting great Japanese food in Phoenix, but I thought Sushi Roku would be a good bet since it's part of a group that has restaurants in SoCal and Vegas.  Wrong bet.

The king crab miso soup tasted like the instant miso soup you buy at the grocery store with old frozen crab stuck in it.  Ironically, I had thought it'd be safer to minimize the sushi since I'm surrounded by desert, but the spicy scallop roll was the one item that was actually wasn't bad - nice chunks of scallops that weren't overly sauced.  

I've had decent sushi/Japanese food in Phoenix before...but it was definitely not at Sushi Roku.  To add insult to injury, they charge high prices for the bad food and slow service.  Thank goodness I didn't get sick after eating that tofu!"}
{"text":"I come here every time I go to Vegas, normally more then once in my trip. The sushi is amazing along with the staff."}
{"text":"Didn't know what our group waned to eat so we left it to the waiter. We told him the things we liked so he could sprinkle it throughout our menu. It was a surprise followed by surprise. Everything was so good! The vibe was definitely club-ish and dark with loud electronic dance music. Lots of suits, money and egos flooding the place but I didn't mind. As long as the food spoke for itself, which it did."}
{"text":"DON'T DO IT!  You're in Vegas, looking for a dining hot spot, and you're gonna be tempted to buy into the the Sushi Roku hype.  Don't do it!

I'm usually skeptical of people who give a place 1 star - I mean how bad could it have been if a sophisticated Yelper went there in the first place, right?  But I have NO idea how this place has 4 stars: there is nothing special AT ALL about the food, the service was pretty poor, and the prices are outrageous.  I've figured out why people go here - there's very little sushi competition in Vegas.  But that doesn't mean it deserves 4 stars.  I think Vegas restaurants must beget a chicken-head lemming syndrome (i.e. girls who didn't pay for the meal highlighting that they have wealthy boyfriends who take them to Vegas headline spots in order to impress their \"friends\" on Yelp).  I hope I'm wrong, but I don't think I am.

A group of us ordered a wide variety of a ton of food there this past weekend for dinner on Saturday night.  I personally tried a few pieces from the Chef's sashimi selection, the braised pork belly, and a couple rolls (crab dynamite and tempura shrimp).  The fish was fresh and tasty, but that's to be expected right?  To me, that's just securing fresh inventory via reliable transportation, so the credit should go to the inventory buyer, not the chef.  While I realize that rolls are the good-intentioned, but unaccomplished cousin in a good sushi restaurant, shouldn't they be pretty easy to make fairly enjoyable?  These were entirely forgettable.  The pork belly was well prepared from a cooking standpoint, but was gaudily overseasoned with ginger, which everone knows can easily overpower a dish.

Another point that irked me was that we made a 9:30PM reservation after a Cirque show.  We showed up early, waited an hour, then were given 2 separate tables for 12 people, despite having requested one large table for our group.  We declined the two tables and waited a while longer to be seated at a clearing large table.  I usually don't mind being split up, but in this case ppl had flown from all over the country to meet in Vegas 1 year after graduating from b-school - we wanted to sit together, and weren't asked about being split up.

The food took FOREVER to order and FOREVER to come.  The waitstaff noticed how long it took, so they brought our group 4 free desserts, which was a nice gesture, but only delayed them bringing the check and prolonged a dinner that took 3.5 hours and killed the rest of our night in which we were planning to drop in on a lounge.

To summarize:
Minus one star: Food flavor
Minus one star: Service (our servers had great attitudes, but at a place like this, execution is what counts, not intentions)
Minus one star: Value (I don't mind paying a premium for great food, service, and overall experience...but this wasn't any of those)
Minus one star: overall poor experience from waiting one hour despite being early for our reservation to having post-dinner plans nixed due to slow service.

Would not recommend to anyone and would not return...can forgo sushi/japanese in Vegas and just get it here in LA."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku is my go-to place for special events such as birthdays, graduations, promotions, etc. the ambiance is wonderful and calming, the service is spectacular and the food is simply delicious! 

For appetizers I would recommend the popcorn shrimp tempura (my favorite!) or the lobster tempura. Hot, crispy, and cooked just right, this appetizer has your mouth singing! For sushi, I love the lobster roll with miso sauce, and any type of sashimi is fresh and delectable. 

If you are a local, you know there are items that can be ordered off the menu. All are delicious, but the white lotus roll is my absolute favorite. 

If you are in the mood for some upscale sushi in a quiet environment with a great view of Vegas, Sushi Roku is for you. The only downfall is the price - a little steep, bit you truly do get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"Good lunch.  Empty restaurant.  Skip the chicken teriyaki in favor of the salmon and sushi.  Everything freshly prepared.  A good choice for a decent meal to break mid-shopping at Forum shops."}
{"text":"Yummmmm.... sushi was awesome!!! We sat at the sushi bar so we got to see them create our plates along with everyone else's. It was super cool to watch!! Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi in the valley, especially when someone else is paying because it's pretty pricy. The sushi always tastes incredibly fresh and the menu has several creative options. I'm not usually a big fan of yellowtail but a friend insisted I try their yellowtail sashimi appetizer. The fiand was so fresh and delicate and the ponzu sauce was so fantastic that I had to restrain myself from licking the plate. I tried big eye tuna sashimi for the first time here and was blown away. I've since tried it at other places and it didn't come close to the flavor and texture of the dish at sushi roku. We had some standard rolls which were also great but my absolute favorite thing I had was the lobster Roll with soy paper and a misoyaki butter sauce. It was so unbelievably delicious! I've been back several times for that roll alone. The ambience is very cool and is great for a special occasion or business dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I were celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary and in search of the best sushi in Vegas. But where? But HERE, recommended by everyone we asked.
Over my ginger mojito and baked lobster roll I gazed adoringly at him, the sparkly strip beyond him, and I realized I could not have asked for more succulent morsels, more perfect service, or a more romantic experience. 
We hope to return to Roku on our 10th, 15th, 20th and so on. Because truly great sushi makes for long, happy lives together. 
Well, probably not. But it should."}
{"text":"This is another expensive sushi place, so it better be good.  I went here late night.  The music is loud, the people are beautiful and the food is good."}
{"text":"Had a double date here. We came to Sin City to watch Tiger Jam at Mandalay. Being in Vegas, we wanted to eat at a place we normally wouldn't go. This place fit the bill. We loved the trendiness and ultra-chicness. The food was outstanding. We tried the kobe beef for appetizer. You cook it on hot rocks. We loved it so much we got another order! The drinks were just as tasty as our meals. Don't ask how much the bill was. Just let me say that I could've purchased a small plasma TV for that amount. I think we saw Tom Hanks show up when we were there. Sushi Roku's manager was really cool and so were our servers. The manager got a little drunk while were there and gave us all a big hug as we said our good byes."}
{"text":"Inside the world famous Forum Shops, Caesars Palace.....wonderful. 

The service was incredibly wonderful. The ambiance and the location are amazing with a superb view of the strip. The decor is beautiful and very romantic. 
  
Only draw back for me is that they are a bit pricey, however locals do receive 20% off."}
{"text":"Love it, Love it, Love it, Love it, Love it.

This place is fantastic.  The sushi was unbelievably good (we are in the middle of a DESERT!!!!), they have 22 oz. Asahi beers and the folks behind the Sushi bar are actually japanese and seem to have studied the art of sushi for a long long time.

I had an excellent experience here and hope that everyone else can experience the same as me at this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"Underrated. Hidden gem. Great find.

Sushi Roku was a fantastic little hole in the wall that without a little investigating, may have never found. My fiancé and I got reservations here and were astounded with the view. You could see the entire strip from our table in a beautifully dimmed atmosphere that was everything we were looking for. 

We started with the usual - sake and edamame. The hot sake was pretty good, but it was the sushi and sashimi that stole the show. 

My personal favorite was the Katana. I have not had anything like it. The server also recommended the skipjack with my choice of yellow tail sashimi.

Big fan!"}
{"text":"Sushi Roku in Vegas is not exactly a great option for sushi IMHO. The food here is ok, a bit on the pricey side for what you get as nothing really stuck out for me as good nor recommendable. The establishment itself is fairly nicely decorated and has a decent location within the forum shops overlooking the Las Vegas strip. The ambiance is pretty cool with nice decor and quite a functional layout. The cuisine and service however just didn't do it for me and there are several better options for sushi consumption in Las Vegas. 

Pros-
Nice location 
Ambiance 
Great sake selection 

Cons-
Below average food 
Small portions 
Somewhat confused staff 
Price per portion ratio is not great 
Lacks any sort of \"wow\" factor for the price point"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Everything was really fresh and came out very fast. Service was excellent. Definitely recommend the Hanabi, Yellowtail Diced Chile's and the Katana roll."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday night when it was relatively quiet and had some wonderful food! But, it wasn't the best sushi as it didn't seem super fresh. 

I got the softshell crab, spicy tuna and yellowtail roll. Very filling but was definitely still hungry after spending ~$60. The sushi portions are very small, and it's probably best to combine it with something a little more carb heavy. 

Although it wasn't very busy in the restaurant, service was a little slow.

Not sure I'll be coming back for sushi here!"}
{"text":"Top notch sushi + Japanese style steakhouse.

let's talk about the sushi first - sushi is all about the rice, it literally means prepared rice.  I say sushi executed at the highest level is 70%rice 30%fish.  The rice at the bar is prepped meticulously;  perfectly al dente, exact same temperature as the fish, just enough moisture and wasabi paste to stick onto fish.  The fish is aged PERFECTLY, breaking clean at the teeth and giving enough funk to remind you what you are masticating afterall.

The steak, oh the steak - absolute, beautiful piece of prime rib eye charred to a perfect medium rare,  served with roasted garlic butter with a side of blanched green beens.  Heaven my friends, absolute heaven.

Great place to grab dinner after some shopping.  It's top notch sushi and steak for about $25 per person.  Worth every penny.  5 stars."}
{"text":"I felt that the sushi was good quality but overall, the food and drinks are still overpriced for what you get at Sushi Roku. I tried the chef's nigiri set, which was beautifully plated with interesting flavor combinations, like shaved Parmesan on tuna and Yuzu jelly on another fish. It was good, I prefer more traditional places that focus on the fish and less so on the ambiance. 

Happy hour (bar seating only) seems like a good deal here, but otherwise the extensive sake list is not that accessible unless you're willing to spend a lot more than what it's worth. I don't think I'd be back (unless with a group for work on company dime). Sushi Roku definitely has decent sushi and a fun vibe if you're looking for a more trendy upscale restaurant, but it just isn't really my thing."}
{"text":"My boss had made a reservation for us after working the FN Platform trade show at Sushi Roku- and maaannnnn did this place really top my night and talk about how amazing the food was to all my friends back home.  The experience and food itself was so perfect that my boss and I came back the following night!

Let me just tell you- I rarely eat sushi- not that I don't eat it but its because I never had a memorable moment with it until I ate at Sushi Roku.

The highlights of my night:

1. The view- I'm all about the views and for my first time in Vegas at eating on the third floor of Caesars Palace really set the mood for the night.
2. The service was outstanding. Our server gave us his favorite meals, suggestions and the food was prepared in a timely manner. 
3. We ordered Scallops with Foie Gras and White Truffle Oil, Spicy Tuna Rolls, Pot Stickers and Chilean Sea bass.
4. The second night we ordered the Pot Stickers and Chilean Seabass again because it was that good.

Now that I found out Sushi Roku is in LA I will be having dinner there all the time!
Next time I'm in Vegas this is definitely the dinner spot I will always go to. Thank you for the experience and best dinner Sushi Roku!"}
{"text":"Great food, AWESOME HAPPY HOUR!!!!! Tuna Tataki, best ever!!! Highly recommend Tuba on Crispy Rice!  Also Foie Gras Sushi Roll is phenomenal! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to Sushi Roku often, food is amazing & the service is what really impresses us.  Julieah & Jennah are awesome, extremely attentive, very acknowledgeable of the menu and pairing foods and beverages! I highly suggest you request a table in their sections if able, I guarantee you won't be disappointed!! Thanks again Julieah & Jennah!!"}
{"text":"The way they treated us was world-class. These well dressed managers Dan and Stephen were on point. Even the guy who filled our water was on it. Their food is amazing especially the steak wrapped asparagus and the miso cod.

With management like this, it is no wonder the W partners with Roku for their target clientele."}
{"text":"This place continues to amaze me. The service and quality of sushi with a great Las Vegas feel cannot be beat. It's really the ultimate sushi experience on the strip. I highly recommend it and Johnny Seo does a wonderful job keeping this restaurant in top form. The sushi chefs are amazing. I continue to go here every time I visit Las Vegas and love it."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku has become one of my favorite places to go to while in vegas.  It's tucked away on the top level of the new Forum shoppes area at Caesar's. The ambiance is something special..it feels very intimate and at the same time you get a nice view of the strip. 

I've dined there three times and all have been great experiences. The first was with a group of sorority sisters, the 2nd with coworkers and third with my mommy when I treated her to Celine Dion. During my first visit, the Manager (a young gentleman) came around to talk to us. We told him we were from the Bay Area and were celebrating 2 birthdays. We chatted a bit about various sushi places in the Bay..and he gave us his business card! By the end of the night, 2 'happy birthday' dessert dishes were brought to our table, compliments of the manager! During the second visit, the same manager came around again and I mentioned I had met him a few months before. At the end of the meal we discovered a nice surprise when the bill came, our dessert dish was removed from the bill! Once again, compliments of the manager. Third time, it was just me and my mom and it was just 4 months later..once again, the nice young gentleman came around and he recognized me. I told him I was back in Vegas treating my mom for her 60th birthday to watch Celine Dion in concert...and now this was the icing on the cake (literally!) ... he ordered the dessert for us and had it delivered to our table as soon as we were done with our main course.. because he didn't want us to be late for the concert!  Once again, compliments of the manager.. 

Now, besides all that luck (or coincidence that he is just always there when i'm there) ...the food is superb. I started to wonder how fresh seafood gets to the middle of the desert and stays fresh. But I immediately forgot about all that once I started eating at this place. Also, from my 3 experiences there I think i've tried all the dessert dishes. They're all delicious and the presentation is lovely. 

Go to Sushi Roku ...and don't forget the dessert! =)"}
{"text":"Good food, but way overpriced for the quality. $24 rolls ?? come on I know we're in Vegas, but come on. The service also needs major improvement. Food was dropped off and never once were we checked on. Extra charge for wasabi ?? at a sushi place.. lol really ? Never again!"}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best sushi I've ever had in my life. We were worried that there weren't many people here, and it was tucked way back into the Forum Shops, but we were completely blown away by the food. If you are looking for very fresh and delicious sushi, definitely come here!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi here.  Came here on a Saturday for lunch and was impressed.  Very fresh selections of fish, delicious Ankimo and Uni.  Had a very nice bottle of high end Sake.  Sat at the sushi bar as we do in all sushi establishments and had a good time with the chef's and staff.

Tempura lobster is very good.  Loved the Aji.  I will be back for more from Sushi Roku."}
{"text":"You must try the crab tartare (crab with uni, caviar, and truffle oil), toro sashimi (cubes of toro with caviar on top), and wagyu beef. Other carpaccio dishes were amazing as well. Oh, the green tea tiramisu was pretty good too. 

Their oyster shooters were a big disappointment. Oysters were slimy, the sauce was too salty and warm (ewww), and mind you, it was $15 each! 
Their sushi rolls sucked!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty happy with what he had here. We considered going to Shibuya, since I knew it to be good, but since we're in the Venetian and it's in MGM Grand, that's a serious hike. So we headed down to Ceasar's for this spot, and were well rewarded.

Service is very friendly - we walked right in and sat at the bar. We ended up ordering a decent selection of nigiri, as well as a spicy tuna, spicy shrimp, and white lotus roll. I also had my standard seaweed salad, which was excellent, although tasted a little like there was a fruit dressing, which I could have done without. Maneki in Seattle still has my all time favorite sunomono.

Rolls were very good, especially the white lotus roll, which, if I'm remembering right, was crispy shrimp, avocado, and asparagus inside, with yellow tail on the outside, fresh hot peppers, and some various sauces. Awesome. I'm really starting to like the fresh peppers in sushi, which I'm seeing in more and more spots. Also worth mentioning, the hamachi I had here is maybe the best I've had. Super tender, super flavorful, just awesome.

Price was excellent too - they left an item off our bill by accident and when we reminded them, they just waved it off. Even with that on the bill, for two people including a couple drinks, the total came to under $100. No, not cheap, but it's sushi...in Las Vegas...and we ate ourselves full. Definitely a would return."}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away by Sushi Roku. I only went to the bar so maybe that was the problem. The drinks were great, bartenders were awesome and it was pretty easy to grab a beverage. There didn't seem to be too many places to sit down as most of the bar seating had already been monopolized. 
The menu looked good and prices good, so I recommend at least a happy hour there!"}
{"text":"Flew into Vegas and had an immediate hankering for sushi and a hope that sushi in Vegas would live up to Vegas' other over-the-top, excellent experiences.  Two types of tuna and a salmon roll later, I was sufficiently satisfied.  Decor could have been better, too dark for my taste, and I got the impression that they were more interested in catering to all of the Japanese customers."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst restaurants I've ever been in. Sat at the table for 15 minutes without being offered water or drinks, food came out before drinks, they screwed up my order and then said \"it would be too much of a hassle and time to make it right again\" - even though our food actually came out super fast in the first place, even before drinks - so basically screw me. My friend had food poisoning after eating the cali roll and crab hand roll. Will never go back or recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to dine in at this location awhile back. The food was great especially the Oysters, it's was amazing. The Unagi was also the best. I would recommend any one who visit Las Vegas to visit this restaurant. Free valet parking.."}
{"text":"The sushi was ok,but they have trouble cooking a steak properly.  First one was too wel done and second was too rare.  Service was ok.  Not sure I'd go back.  Mostly empty on a saturday night should have been a tip off.  The view is great!!!"}
{"text":"It's so damn expensive.  but the food is legit."}
{"text":"Pricey but good.  Sits adjacent to the W and has a pretty nice selection of sushi as it relates to flavors and variety.  The website says no casual pool dress, but the place was full of that attire so I am not sure what that is all about."}
{"text":"Very over priced, but worth it. It was the best sushi I have ever had. Views were great, service pretty good. The pork belly fried rice was amazing!!! The drink menu is fun. I had the Roku Infusion, It came out with smoke like dry ice, but it tasted pretty bad. I wouldn't recommend it. Cant go wrong with any of the food..it was so perfect."}
{"text":"Pretty sure I died and went to sushi heaven after eating here last night! Sat down at the sushi bar and had the most entertaining sushi chefs! I tried their recommendations of the hirame (winter halibut) and rotate (sea scallops), both sashimi style was out of this world!! Freshest and best selection I have enjoyed in a long time!! For drinks, went with hot sake but they do serve quite a collection of wine, specialty drinks (which I will have to try next time) and other sakes.
Expensive but worth it!! Location, ambiance and food here made for a great evening!
Thank you Sushi Roku!"}
{"text":"Oh dear god can someone get me another black truffle tempura handroll STAT. That's all you need to get from here. $10 or so and you'll have this beautifully crunchy and nutty mouthful of sushi. The black truffle is in the dipping sauce they serve the roll with so don't be an idiot and go dipping in your regular soy sauce! I would only come back to Sushi Roku to order this handroll. 

Yes you do get a nice, undisturbed view of the strip (towards the Bellagio and Paris) but you'll definitely pay an arm and a leg for very small portions of sushi. Delicious, yes. Filling? Not so much. 

The lobster roll we got has a special sauce drizzled all over the plate that tastes a lot like Todai's creamy sauce baked over their lobster halves and boy was it fingerlicking good. But it was $21+ for 5 (kind of small) pieces of sushi (see my picture if you don't believe me). 

You are definitely paying for the view and atmosphere here. So go ahead, bring a date here if you want to splurge. But if you want a full stomach without breaking the bank, Sushi Roku ain't the place for you!

P.S. I'm all for ambiance and I understand that this is a sushi restaurant so the saying \"quality over quantity\" is taken very literally, but if a place is going to charge that much for their food, I expect service to be top notch as well and for me the service was just so-so. Hence, the 3 stars."}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in Las Vegas and have done so for years. There is one close to me in Los Angeles, but I truly believe the Vegas location is the best of them all.  Yes, it is expensive, but the fish is flown in daily and it is consistently the best tasting fish available.  

Do yourself a favor and order the Shima Roll with spicy tuna, shrimp, cilantro and sriracha.  It is fantastic. Other Must-Try menu items are the garlic green beans, tuna carpaccio with garlic chips, the baked miso black cod, yellowtail sashimi with diced chilis, anything from their sushi/sashimi menu and their specials are always great. Whenever foie gras is on the specials menu, my partner always orders it because he can't get it in California and he always enjoys what he orders.  

When you make your reservation, request a table by the window for a spectacular view of the strip. This makes an already romantic setting even more special."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to love Sushi Roku... but alas, poor service has ruined an otherwise wonderful restaurant.  But there's just no excuse for bad service in a high-end, expensive Vegas restaurant like this. Not when there are so many other amazing restaurants to enjoy.

The first time I came here, we were promptly seated at the sushi bar, where we just sat... forever... with nothing.. no drinks, no water, no menu. We looked uncomfortably around wondering if the restaurant was really even open yet. I finally had to awkwardly ask the sushi chef if we were supposed to order drinks from him (which is normally bad etiquette in a sushi restaurant, as the chefs only make the sushi). Finally a waitress showed up with menus and took our drink orders. And at some point later in the evening, those drinks finally found their way to us.

In sharp contrast to the incompetent waitress, the sushi chefs were AMAZING. We ordered several of the high-end specialty sushi rolls (at about $26 a roll), and what we received was as delicious as it was beautiful. My favorites were the Titan roll, which was like a piece of art, and the Katana roll. Everything was so fresh and tasty.

Meanwhile, we finished our drinks and ordered a second round. Once again we waited.. and waited... and waited. Keep in mind, there wasn't ANYONE else in our section... the restaurant was not busy at all, the bartenders at the bar looked bored... yet we waited and waited and waited some more for our drinks. By now, we had already finished the meal, and honestly, probably even digested it already. Once again I had to awkwardly ask the sushi chef for help. Only this time I asked for a manager (after explaining to the chef that he had done nothing wrong!).  The manager apologized, and soon we had our drinks. But really, we didn't even care at that point because we were ready to leave. Then I was shocked when I first received the bill, as nothing had been comped, but later when the slip came for me to sign, I found that he had comped the drinks and some of the sushi, so at least there's that.

In our most recent trip to Vegas, we decided to give this restaurant another shot, since we liked the sushi so much. This time we sat at a table with a great view of the strip. I really liked the decor of the dining room, and felt quite comfortable there. But once again, the service disappointed us.  The first item we tried to order was the Oyster sushi, and were told they were out.  Next we tried to order the Spanish Mackerel sushi, and were told they were out of that too. Finally we ordered some rolls that they did have... and the waiting began again. As more and more time passed and we still hadn't received our sushi, I realized that this restaurant just has fundamental service problems. The waiter apologized and explained that sushi chefs were \"slammed,\" but really, there's just no excuse for that when you are paying $26 a roll. We had tickets to see a show later, and I was starting to stress about whether we were even going to make it on time. I was also annoyed when the waiter gave us only a little bit of wasabi and ginger, to share, and then he even took that away partway through the meal!  I had to ask for more.

I think this restaurant has so much potential, and I really do think the sushi here is very good. But bad service just ruined the whole experience for me. If it weren't for the great sushi and wonderful view of Vegas, I'd definitely be giving this restaurant only one star. Later in this same trip, we ate at Blossom in the Aria hotel, paid $20-$25 per entree, and had some of the most amazing service we've had in a restaurant. When you are in Vegas, you want to have fun and be treated like a king... and Sushi Roku just didn't do it for me. So disappointed."}
{"text":"We used to come here often in Vegas specifically for their tuna tare tare. They have a new tuna tare tare that has a crispy dough cup that has now replaced the infamous old tuna tare tare and let me tell you it pales in comparison to the old recipe. 
We requested to have the old recipe made but to our shock sushi chef said no it can't be done. I thought wow! Since when does Sushi Roku NOT accommodate their customers even if they have all the ingredients?? Any sushi place I've been to would have done this. 
It was explained to us that it's a corporate thing and they want to keep the menu the same across all locations.  IMHO this dilutes the wow factor of Sushi Roku as a top notch sushi destination.  Very disappointing as this was a signature dish that is no longer available because of a corporate strategy. This is not putting your customers first.  
Service was great though.  But sadly we will not be returning to our once favorite sushi destination here in Vegas because they refuse to accommodate their customers. This place has lost its lustre."}
{"text":"Gotta say, I was definitely disappointed in this place. You are paying for the strip view and nice atmosphere at this restaurant. The sushi was average at best. The sake we got a bottle of was good - though it was $35 for a 330ml bottle (barely bigger than a beer bottle). And that was one of the cheapest there. Would not recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"I first ate here two years ago and thought it was very good.  I love the Sushi Roku's in Santa Monica, Hollywood and Pasadena.  My recent lunch there surpassed all of these and any expectations from my first visit in 2010.  

Here's what I ate, all prepared by a young sushi chef named Moon, who is in my book a rising sushi star:

Uni sushi - this was two pieces of uni of the highest quality, sweet and unctuous, simply perfect

Spicy scallop hand roll - sweet and fresh scallops, so fresh they were almost a bit crunchy when bitten into, and the sauce was subtly spicy, but not overly hot.  The nori they use here is of the best quality - it crackles when you bite into it, but does not shatter.

Eel and avocado hand roll - Über-rich, sweet and addictive.  The avocado was at its peak of ripeness, the eel sweet and almost melting, and the sauce, which Moon told me was cooked down from sea eel, lent a sweet and an umami flavor to this wonderful roll.

Baked crab hand roll - My favorite dish of the day.  Beautiful crab (it tasted like Alaskan king, but not sure), baked with garlic butter and wrapped in soy paper.  If you love crab, you MUST order this.  I need to have it again.  So good.

Service was great, I  enjoyed speaking with Moon about all kinds of food topics, and the sushi bar is a pleasant place to while away a midday hour.  I went on a slow Sunday afternoon and am so glad that I did.  It can be quite a scene on weekend evenings (lots of pretty blonde women in tiny black dresses), but come for the food, too!

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Trendy interesting looking place with friendly staff.  Food was pretty good but just not worth the expense and super small portions.  Great for people watching and burning a hole in your pocket but that's about it."}
{"text":"In las Vegas as well as other big restaurant/entertainment towns, good food is expected but in Las Vegas it sometimes does not fully compare to Chicago and NY.

However, the one place I finally went to was Samba Sushi and what a great surprise.  I tend to avoid sushi in several places when traveling unless in Hawaii and some parts of CA and Japan.  Sushi Samba had some of the best dishes I have had and the quality was great.  They have a variety of menu items with small plates and full entrees.  They do some traditional sushi but mostly more interesting variations as well as the S American dishes.  Some of the items were:
Rock fish
Wagyu Gyoza
Rock shrimp tempura
Green bean tempura
Pork belly
Moqueca Mista. Seafood coconut milk and rice with green onion
Yamato sushi roll(maguro, Fois gras, Osetra caviar)
Uni shushi outstanding 
Great sake list

All the fish and shellfish were fresh and well prepared.

It gets busy so we ate at the bar and the service was excellent there.  Luna and Maria can help with picking some great dishes at the bar.

It is on the higher price side but worth it compared to a lot of other places where the food doesn't always live up to the expectations in Vegas.  Looking forward to next trip back there."}
{"text":"We decided to create our own sushi tour while visiting Las Vegas. We researched the sushi restaurants and picked 5 to try. We went in with the thought that we would ask for a recommendation from the staff and that is what we would order. GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!! recommendation was Excellent!"}
{"text":"This is a small California based chain. The atmosphere at the sushi bar is OK but needs work. For example, when you first arrive, you are greeted loudly (good). However, after that most of the sushi chefs are silent. Only one chef (left most, perhaps the most senior) was a little talkative. On the positive side, the patrons were very friendly; I don't know if this is normal, or was just a coincidence.

In my two meals at the sushi bar, I've tried:
* ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). Five medium slices; firm, with a very rich texture. Excellent.
* uni (sea urchin). Pretty good, but wasn't as firm or tasty as it could be.
* ama-ebi (raw shrimp). Good overall. The heads were served tempura style, but were not as juicy or as crispy as they should be.
* awabi (abalone). Good
* unagi (barbecued eel). Pretty standard. It should have been hotter and a little crisp.
* hamachi (yellowtail). Good.
* Smoked salmon wrapped ankimo topped with toro tartar, uni and caviar. It also included a layer of spinach, and gold leaf was placed on top. There were three pieces, each piece too big to eat in one bite, so eating it was tricky. Other than that, it was very tasty. 
* Bincho maguro (albacore). Seared, topped with onion and a vinegary sauce. Good to very good.
* Kohada (shad) served with shiso leaf. Moderately strong flavor, but milder than other similar fish (like saba/mackeral). Very good.


The sushi was generally very good, but not quite up to the standards of Hyakumi or Okada. It was cheaper than Hyakumi but no cheaper than Okada. Keep in mind that I'm comparing Sushi Roku to my two favorite sushi bars in all of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to come here last minute, it was very empty during lunch time. This place did have a nice view of the strip but other than that it was just ok. We don't mind spending money on great food and good service but the food was just average. We both ordered miso soup, shared edamame, ordered one roll each and also each got the lunch combination. The food was just average but not worth $120.00. I would skip it next time."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Drinks took half an hour to be served after we had ordered. Service was ok. Average restaurant. Way too pricey for the \"ok\" experience we had. There are better japanese restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi hands down since I moved out here from Cali!! I've been here twice already and both times I left smiling. Great fish variety and super fresh! They also had a few fishes I've never had before so it was a great experience. I strictly eat sashimi and/or sushi only and can say this is seriously some of the tastiest and freshest fish I've tried in the valley. The chefs are super friendly and funny. Great customer service all around. I am definitely going to become a regular!"}
{"text":"The sushi is ok but the eye candy is ridiculous.  People in scottsdale don't wear clothes.  Its amazing"}
{"text":"It was just okay. I didn't order anything extravagant just a couple rolls. The service was good,not exceptional and the rolls tasted okay. My disappointment comes from the prep time of my rolls. They took maybe 3 or 4 minutes to arrive at my table after I ordered them. This tells me they were made ahead and sitting in a cooler.  I expected more from a restaurant on the strip."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Phoenix by far, and great service to boot. Even just basics, yellow tail, etc, are phenomenal and there saki menu is comprehensive. The baked hand crab roll is amazing, especially with the dipping sauce."}
{"text":"It took awhile to find the place, but had I read the directions on the website first, that could have been avoided! At first glance the restaurant seemed very dead.  All of the seats in the front were empty, but as soon as the hostess took us to our reserved seat around the corner, we saw a whole other part of the restaurant where all of the tables were full.  Great service by the wait staff, excellent sushi and non sushi items.  The truffle sushi roll was AMAZING!  The restaurant has a great view of the strip and was exactly what I wanted for my birthday dinner in Vegas.  The waiter brought out a dessert and a candle/sparkler to help my group celebrate my birthday.  The prices not out of control either."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was very tasty, although the fish wasn't as fresh as I expected. You must try the octopus sashimi. Very pricey but it is worth it because of their unique and tasty dishes."}
{"text":"PRICE         1   stars    (Too Pricey)
FOOD         3.75 starts (Good quality)     
SERVICE    4.5 stars    (Good host and great staff)
QUANTITY  2.5 stars   (Really small portions)

Hence I gave it a total of 3 stars

Items we got

- $5 Miso Soup
- $18 Tuna sashami Caprico (Cold Appetizer)
- $22 Katana Roll (Special Roll)
- $11 Spicy Shrimp with Asparagus (Regular Hand Cut roll)
- $10 Wine for the wife (Argentinian, she really liked it) 

Total $71 with tax. Total bill $82. Still left hungry and only got 1 drink.

Would I go there again ? Yes only if I win money while I gamble."}
{"text":"My friend had a gift card for Sushi Roku and asked me to help him spend it and I was glad I could help! We were a little early so we sat in the bar with Regis who was super cool and outgoing. We had a couple of mojitos that were too sweet for us but still pretty good. We ate the spicy yellowtail, kobe potstickers and tempura shrimp. The yellowtail was amazing! We then got seated by a nice hostess (tall blond) and were put in Justins station. Needless to say, he was awesome! The happy hour on sundays is phenomenal. Half priced bottles of wine. So, we imbibed. My friend asked Justin a ton of questions and was borderline annoying but Justin kept his cool and treated us well. The manager, Stephen came by and was also very professional and courteous. We had the filet wrapped asparagus and the short ribs  were delicious. Overall, we had a fantastic time and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Of course everyone comes here because of their great ratings, but from my experience this place deserves 3 stars!

Ambience: This is probably what gets this place such great ratings. No lie it's really nice and high up with great views. The lighting is dim, creating a nice romantic evening vibe! Everything is nicely decorated too. Ps. I hope you guys find this place easily if you're still planning on coming after this review because it took me 30 mins haha it's in the mall!!!! 3rd floor!

Food: the food is really really bland and mediocre unless you came with the notion that you are going to spend 300$. I got two sushi rolls (shrimp tempura and spicy tuna) and they were both not appealing at all. If this place had Mikuni quality sushi I would have been okay with paying such high prices, but literally the food was so plain and definitely not worth what we paid. 

Drinks: We got a sake bottle that was like flavored sweet sake which was good, it was 40$ and is around 8 shots worth of sake

Service: the service wasn't bad, our lady frequented our table around 3-4 times total when we were there! The weird part is that they already add the tip to your bill, and she added 21%. I usually understand when there's 8+ people that they do that but there was only 4 of us! A little strange... 

Also heads up for if you are planning on coming during a special holiday; because on New Years to cancel your reservation they charge 50$ a person"}
{"text":"Awesome! We got a nice cozy booth...had an awesome server-The guy with two names! Haha :) anyway..spicy tuna roll, the edamame, and the kimchee cucumber sunomono were premier! Went two nights..valet was a breeze :) but def a place to dress highline style as patrons are seemingly there to be seen. Haha :) had a blast each night because of how friendly EVERYONE was to us..hostess, mgr., and def our server. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not the BEST SUSHI EVER, but not bad. Slightly over priced, but to be expected in Scottsdale. Our waiter was really adorbs. He went through basically the entire menu with us after we said we hadn't been there before, giving suggestions and letting us know what was his favorite. Started with shishito peppers (ok, would have been better without the sauce) and green beans (sister enjoyed, I was meh, just didn't care the sauce). We went with the chefs special which included 12 pieces of his choice, a California roll, and a spicy tuna roll. I think it was about $40? Not awful and the pieces were tasty. The best of the meal for me was the sake sampler. 3 almost-double shots of different sakes for $12. YUM."}
{"text":"I ordered the crispy spicy tuna ($16) with chicken fried rice ($15), both were filling and well prepared. Service was great, ambiance was excellent. Well priced considering you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku is hands down my favorite sushi restaurants from all around the country. I have been to multiple sushi places in Vegas and all over the east coast. As a super sushi lover, it is extremely rare that I am impressed with the quality of sushi the way I was with Sushi Roku. Growing up my parents owned their own sushi restaurant and I am confident when I say.. I know my fish. I don't know or understand how they manage to always have the freshest quality of fish despite the fact that LV is in the middle of a desert but I hope they keep it up.. forever. 

Servers are helpful, kind, and knowledgeable of the menu. If you don't know where to start, ask them for their thoughts and they'd definitely help you. I highly recommend the Shima Roll but to be really honest, it seems that you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The price range tends to be on the higher end but hey, you're in vegas--the city of excess/riches and you're in a desert yet you are being served fresh fish.. what did you expect? And as I've said, the quality and taste is as good as it gets. 

If you are a sushi lover, I recommend that you give this place a go!"}
{"text":"Ehh...the sushi ain't soo good! The servers were not soo nice, the ambiance is great, but the server-no not soo great! You problably could get better sushi somewhere else, we tried this place because we were staying at Caesers! I won't be returning!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best spicy tuna roll everrrr.

Fun atmosphere, great waitstaff, awesome lighting.  :)

Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"A++++++++

Great service, vibe, sushi is great! Perfect spot to grab a drink or for a date night. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We came here for Happy Hour on a Sunday night.  We ordered off the HH menu, a bunch of cheap rolls.  Needless to say that we were super disappointed.  The rice on the rolls were Way overcooked so we were left with mushy rolls.  For such a nice location this sushi restaurant is a disappointment!"}
{"text":"The service was great. The atmosphere was great. The price was a bit high. The real problem was in the blandness of the food. Maybe I am a bit spoiled out here on the coast but everything was bland. Maybe they aim the flavor at a mid-west palate? Spicy'less tuna?"}
{"text":"Delicious. We were craving sushi something fierce on our Vegas trip and this place hit the spot. Friendly and prompt service and delicious food. Get the roll with the curry paste (balls it's good!). We also enjoyed the crab dynamite roll, shima roll, and spicy scallop roll. The chicken skewers were awesome too."}
{"text":"Fantastic food,  awesome ambiance and terrific service!  We were celebrating our 23rd anniversary and we loved it. Try the foie gras, absolutely love it. Salmon dinner was terrific. Yes, we'll worth the price."}
{"text":"This place is expensive and the portions are soooo small. The view is nice and decor is beautiful but that's about it. We spent $150 (including tip) for three people and left feeling hungry. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a great place for groups. It's loctaed in the W Hotel. Good location. Every time a group walks in the chefs make lots of noise. They gave shots on the house and made the meal quite enjoyable!

The sushi was good, not spectacular but very good!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch after shopping in caesars..i was able to get a seat at sushi bar right away...i ordered a drink as recommended by server called the far east mule..it was refreshing n good...i ordered the 8 piece roku signature style sushi..it was absolutely delicious! The sushi chef described each one n explained that no soy sauce was needed..i enjoyed each one i cant wait to go back n order it again! Great food n service!"}
{"text":"Omg yellow tail wrapped foie. Need I say more? Yummmmn. Uni, crudo, chefs pick. Holy moly everything was amazing. I think this is one of the best sushi places that I have ever had. I want some now as I'm writing this. Come and you won't be disappointed. Good luck and good eats!!"}
{"text":"Placed an order on uber eats, an hour later I'm informed it's canceled. If you're not able to fulfill an order, at least inform the customer in a timely manner"}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely at the top of our most memorable experiences at Vegas, along with a few others. This was certainly my best sushi experience ever. My partner and I shared a few rolls and dessert together.. and I must say it is not an exaggeration that I had a culinary experience similar to that of exploding fireworks! We were thrilled (and disappointed at the same time) to pay the bill at the end. 

I was particularly intrigued by the ability of the masters behind this food to capture these amazing smokey flavors in sushi that I had otherwise never experienced before. 

I highly recommend going here for either a romantic experience for two, or for taking out your team for an amazing meal! You could certainly see that the patrons all fell between these two categories judging by the Expo name tags and dressed up couples.

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, spectacular views of the strip, picturesque sushi, very attentive and accommodating waitstaff. 

Think of Miyake's in Palo Alto fun atmosphere and Miyagi's in LA scene blended and done right Caesar's style."}
{"text":"Food was decent- nothing that blew us away. Rice on the sushi seemed soggy.  Service was so-so. We felt rushed, timing of food was bad, and staff wasn't as knowledgable on the menu as I would expect for a place that has a lot of hype in this area."}
{"text":"I try to check out Sushi Roku when ever I'm in Vegas and down at the Forum Shops.  Sushi Roku always has excellent sushi and wagyu beef.  The sake selection is also top shelf and they have one heck of a happy hour.

You should take the time to check them out!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.

My friend and I started off ordering appetizers. I ordered the kimchee cucumber salad. When it arrived it was cucumbers in vinegar dressing but no kimchee. Another woman, who wasn't our waitress delivered it, and she saw I was confused so she asked me if everything was okay. I asked her where the kimchee was and she said the kimchee is mixed with the vinegar. I was slightly disappointed. She asked if I wanted to send it back and I said no it's fine, I'd give it a try. I took a bite and wow! It was so delicious. Tons of flavor. Seconds later our waitress arrived as she was notified I wasn't 100% pleased with the cucumber salad. I was super impressed they were so attentive to my needs. Our waitress also offered to swap it out for something else and while I told her it was different than what I had expected that it was totally delicious. They really wanted to make sure I was happy with what I had ordered.

Following my appetizer I ordered the baked lobster roll and some albacore sashimi. It was out of this world! The baked lobster roll is drizzled with hollandaise sauce. So delicious! And the albacore was so fresh and served with an amazing garlic ponzu sauce.

Our waitress checked on us several times. She was so sweet and really wanted to make sure we had a good experience. I will definitely come back here next time I'm in Vegas. Next time I will try to leave room to try some dessert."}
{"text":"Great service. Drinks and waiters were delightful. Food was fantastic. The spicy tuna was fantastic, the best item to me was the hanabi for anyone wanting to go. The popcorn shrimp was the only thing that wasn't very good, a little to doughy but otherwise a fantastic experience every time I go."}
{"text":"5 stars for ambiance, two stars for both food and service. 

Great decor and view looking over the street. Service was slow, poorly timed, and not very helpful. Food was mediocre - my boyfriend and I got the edamame hummus (pita was great, hummus was bland), spicy tuna roll (eh) an avacado roll, and pork belly fried rice (incredibly bland). Definitely over priced.

Won't be returning, except perhaps for drinks to enjoy the view."}
{"text":"Let me be clear that we may have gone on the wrong day as it was Valentine's Day. The place was noisy, very crowded & the tables near each other. The food is great but we felt rushed perhaps because they wanted to turn the tables. The lady who waited on us was knowledgeable and elegant. It's a bit pricey to not be able to relax but then again it was Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"Great location in the W and the food was good but I would not exceptional.  In addition made reservations but they were not able to seat us for almost 40 minutes - made the reservation more or less pointless.  

Overall the crunchy tuna roll was my favorite.  Nothing was bad but that definitely stuck out from the 10 dishes we ordered."}
{"text":"I know-Sushi, Vegas? What? um...

I have to say the West Hollywood location is way better. 

I had the Hamachi and scallion roll, crunchy spicy tuna (fried, over cooked the tuna) and the Hamachi jalapeno sashimi. 

Over all is was an \"ok\". I wouldn't go back based on this experience. But next time i'm down in the west area, I'll go there."}
{"text":"We went to this place on NYE. It was a classy place. We ordered tofu 3ways and salmon sashimi carpaccio for appetizers. The tofu dish is decent. The sashimi carpaccio is very flavorful. We also got matsu sushi selection and Japanese style ribeye steak and they both taste great."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku is kind of hidden since its on the third floor of the Forum Shops. Few people have told me that this place was pretty good, so I knew it existed. However, we never actually dined here until recently. Came here on a Saturday night, but the restaurant was empty. There were a few people sitting at the sushi bar and maybe 3 other tables that were occupied. 

We started off with three of their Signature Rolls - the Crunchy Spicy Tuna, Crab Dynamite and the Baked Lobster. My husband and I liked the Baked Lobster one the best. They put a creamy Miso sauce on top of the roll which was good, but if it had a stronger Miso flavor, it would have been perfect! There was nothing special about the other two that we ordered. They were basically your standard Spicy Tuna and California Rolls that can be found at any sushi restaurant. We also ordered the Popcorn Shrimp Tempura. Kind of hard to screw up Shrimp Tempura, but it was tasty with the sauce. My only complaint is that maybe they should consider having the spicy creamy sauce on the side because after a while, the shrimp seemed sort of soggy.  

Service was excellent. Our server was friendly and checked on us often. Our drinks were always being refilled and empty plates were taken away quickly. 

I'm glad I tried Sushi Roku, but there was nothing special about this place that makes me want to come back. I think they need more selections for their signature rolls. I'm a snob when it comes to sushi, so I already have my favorite sushi spot! But for a $100 bill for 2 people, there are definitely better places to eat sushi."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 4 stars

I would not come here for the food ever again! I remembered biting into a tempura veggie mix and it had the undercooked taste.  Sushi was very mediocre.  

Awesome, eye candy scene (Cougars galore) but the quality of the food just was not up to par with the rest of the sushi/Japanese community.  And of course, way over priced!"}
{"text":"At Sushi Roko the Sushi was ok, albeit extra small portions, but what can you expect on the strip, probably never outstanding food quality and service.

The interior looks tired and needs some updating, especially most of the black wooden chairs that all need some serious attention."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku is an excellent sushi restaurant, my favorite in LV, and one of my favorites in the USA.  You can fall into the trap that I always fall into- which is ordering a ton of the most expensive sushi- but you can also take a more reasonable path and eat lunch specials, omakase plates, etc, and you will save your wallet.  The quality has always been consistently excellent.  They generally have excellent, juicy / fatty toro, and the nigiri slices are generously cut and well executed.  Although I seldom eat rolls, they have a creative selection.  

**LV residents should note that they give a 20% off locals discount- huge score!

I will always return to Sushi Roku when in LV- absolutely love it!  Highly recommended for all levels of 'sushi expertise', and the non-sushi menu (which I don't venture into) is extensive enough to satisfy non-sushi eaters as well.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My experience with this place was quite mixed, but overall I had to give them 4 stars. Here's why:
At first the experience was NOT good:
-We were seated next to a huge party that was so loud I couldn't even hear my friends. The place was full so we weren't able to switch tables and it really ruined the whole dining experience because we couldn't even talk to each other!
-Food took foooorever to come out and, when it did, some of it was missing and some of it was wrong. The tempura veggies weren't even cooked!
But they did a LOT to try to make it better:
-They comped our veggies and brought us complimentary tempura shrimp and shots for the table
-The manager came over and personally apologized for the loudness and the mishaps we'd had with our food
And overall, the service was great considering how busy the place was. The food did take a long time to come out, but we weren't in a rush so it was fine.
In terms of quality food - the tempura shrimp were amazing! The specialty sushi rolls were great, but the regular rolls were nothing special (literally nothing to them - could make them at home yourself). I'd say don't waste money on the \"regular\" rolls - get the specialty ones! They're pricier, but you get more (8 pieces instead of 5 or 6) and with many more flavor combinations, sauces, etc.
So overall I'd say to give the place a chance. It has good food, good service, and good drinks."}
{"text":"Sushi Roku, good reputation in LA. Sushi Roku in Las Vegas should be called Sushi Fooku, because that's what they're going to do to your wallet and your palate.

A group of 5 of us came here around 9:30PM on Saturday night, in need of pre-late night nourishment. Yelping before leaping, this place had a decent review on Yelp. This is one of the only times I have  been steered wrong...but it was oh so wrong.

The problems started when we began to select rolls to order. Usually I'm a sashimi girl, and I shy away from rolls. But I knew I wanted something to fill us all up. So I started everyone off with the Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice, and the first roll Spicy Canadian Rock Shrimp with Asparagus. The Tuna w/ Crispy Rice was great, but this is a standard for any sushi restaurant. The roll, on the other hand, was so tiny, 6 small pieces with even smaller ingredients - 11 dollars down.

I asked our waiter what he suggested in terms of rolls, and wouldn't you know it, the rolls he told us about were both the MOST expensive rolls on the menu, 26 dollars a piece. A-hole.

We ordered three more rolls, all small and average tasting and then were told that the kitchen was closing - WTF, 11, this is Vegas? But whatever, that's fine, we're done anyway. One round of drinks for 4 people, 2 edamames and four of the CHEAPEST rolls was $150 dollars. I'd happily shell out twice this if I didn't think I was merely paying for the overhead of the restaurant, because I know the food didn't cost 1/4 of that.

If you do go here, don't expect anything great from the rolls.  It's an expensive tourist joint, plain and simple. The worst part is that it's now highly unlikely I go to this place in Los Angeles. I was so sad to have this experience because of Roku's great name out in LA, but I have to say, this location is the King of Meh."}
{"text":"eh, we went on a tuesday night and the place was pretty dead.  It is a very cool space and after eating at the Vegas location i was excited to try it. it was Ok, nothing spectacular and the service was really spotty (even though they were pretty dead). Our sushi came out before our apps, which was not what we would have preferred and was very strange.  I am sure there are better places for sushi in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch May 2015 and had the spicy tuna roll with avocado. 
I am the person who gave NO tip because of the following bad service:
- my server was basically not existent.  
-I asked for brown rice instead of white rice and they said it's impossible to do brown rice because of the it ALL the time.

-I got no avocado on it at all when asked. 

-No condiments on table or offered. 
-my food took forever to come and when it did it was luke warm/cold (it's deep fried) so it must of been sitting around for ages. The place was very quiet and after the lunch rush time. 2.30
- the serving size was not worth the price
- after I was finished, I was still hungry but there was no one around to get a menu off. Frustrated at waiting, I went to the front desk and checked out"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and I'm never disappointed with my meal. Making a reservation is always a breeze, all the employees are very professional and friendly. 
I love all the dishes, and have yet to try something that I didn't enjoy. Service is always great. It's always nice to come here for special occasions since they are very accommodating. Definitely put this on your list of sushi spots to try!"}
{"text":"Totally killed my feet while treking through the Forum Shops at Caesars to get to this place, but hey I had to look flyyyy and wear my oh so unomfortable heels =\

Anyhoo, on yelp it says this place is located though Caesars Palace, and maybe that is the easiest way to get there, but damn it is far!  And in heels the walk seems so much further.

My SO and I came here for our anniversary dinner.  We were seated by the window, and had an amazing view of the strip.  

We ordered:  

Starters

-Chinese Green Beans with Garlic  - super delish.  I could eat these all day.
-Tuna Sashimi Carpaccio - reallly fresh, and tasty.

Mains

-Baked Lobster Roll - this roll was so dissapointing.  The lobster was chewy, had an unusual taste to it.  I couldnt stomach more than 1 bite. 
-Spicy Tuna Roll - so delish!  It was fresh, and melt in your mouth good.
-Panko Double Shrimp Roll - My favorite!  So good!

I've been to the Sushi Roku in Arizona, and that location was so superb...I was hoping this location would be just as good, but turned out to be just okay."}
{"text":"Located at The W Hotel in Scottsdale, AZ, Sushi Roku is a hip, lounge-y, fun Japanese restaurant.  

I had the pleasure of staying at The W for a training seminar I was attending and my coworker and I were addicted to Sushi Roku as soon as we got there.  We ate at this restaurant on 3 different occasions and were never bored with their food or atmosphere.  

We tried a few appetizers; spicy edamame and a shrimp dumpling soup which was to die for!  So flavorful, I could have eaten just that...but ofcourse it didn't stop there.  We also had a few of their speciality rolls *don't remember which ones...sorry, as well as some sashimi and the Miso glazed Sea Bass with mash potatoes...yummy!  All were very good and I would have again, but I have to compliment the waitstaff, bartenders and manager who made a lasting impression.  We dined at the bar our last night and everyone was SUPER friendly and made us feel like apart of their 'Sushi Roku Family'....you guys rock!

Till next time...Irrishai-mase!!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch and had a really good time.  The tempura was so fresh as was the eel and avocado roll and the spicy tuna roll.  The beer was so fresh and the atmosphere was perfect for lunch. The seating is super cozy and it made us want to stay all day and eat sushi and drink beer! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing service and the best food!  Pricey but worth it.  Take your time and enjoy everything.  Careful not to order too much because it is filling but so delicious.  The wait staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was great and the seats comfortable.  I don't think I've been to a better sushi place yet."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi place I've been to in the USA! The sushi chefs are actually Japanese.  Our bill pre tax pre tip was $250, and the two of us only ate sushi, it's not an expensive place, that tells you how good the sushi is here, so we ate so much of them!"}
{"text":"Awful service. Stated couldn't split a 6 person check because he couldn't remember what each of us ordered.. When we labeled them for him still got it wrong. Manager was no help stated that he just wanted us in and out and he didn't even apologize for the issue plus HE was wearing diamond earrings with a tux. If I want to go to a nice restaurant and have a $300 bill I shouldn't have to deal with bad service and will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Amazing fish to be savored here. 

Quiet mid week lunch I joined 3 others at the sushi bar and scanned the menu.  Sashimi combo- 2 cuts of 4 fish but mouthwatering delicious. 
Monkfish Liver sushi was a nice change. Never had it before and actually I don't recall seeing it on other menus. Not bad. I'd order it again. 
Tako roll was small. A let down compared to the amazing presentation of fish.

The takeaway here is high quality in an upscale location with warm charm and great service. You do pay for what you get but it's worth it. I'll be back for dinner with friends."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in all of Las Vegas. When I visit the city, I make sure to make a stop here. The sashimi is really fresh, I even remembered the sushi chef saying that some of it comes from Japan. Toro has to be my favorite sashami there. Tastes like butter and melts in your mouth. I think I've tried just about everything there and all of it really stands out and makes me dream about coming back."}
{"text":"Such a great happy hour! And they do it 7 days a week.....
Only gripe is that it's at the bar only and sometimes it's a little tight seating......
Best thing we had was the cauliflower/date dish. Amazing!!! And their signature martini cocktail! Must try if you like sweeter cocktails."}
{"text":"Son of a b*tch this place is good. We had the Japanese Yellowtail Sashimi, the Popcorn Rock Shrimp, the Spicy Jumbo Shrimp with Spicy Potato Chips and the grilled eggplant. OMG....wow, just...wow! There wasn't one thing I didn't like but any of these dishes. The food was fresh, the flavors were divine...I was in heaven.

I also got the Teriyaki Salmon lunchbox which was also very good. The only thing I can say that wasn't top notch was the miso soup...just a tad bit too smokey but all in all this place is a definite on a return trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"This is the greatest place in Scottsdale for sushi and drinks. Logan is an awesome server and can't thank Dan the man enough for being such a great manager!!!!!"}
