{"text":"It's funny the amount of stars I am giving them is the same as the amount of hotdogs every single person ate.. They are so good you can't even stop.  Don't visit if you are on a diet. You will not be able to contain your emotions. It could get weird.  LOOOOOVE"}
{"text":"Much respect for this guy. Dropped what he was doing and came out to our Desert Fanatics Veterans Day Flag Run to show is support and respect for veterans and active duty military.  Busted out his cart and started serving some of the best hand down hot dogs you all ever have. I highly recommend Chi Town. We will def have him every year at our veterans day flag run. One of the many reasons is they are amazing it dogs and he puts his own spin on them. You can also tell that he takes pride in his work too. If you ever see his cart out def get one!"}
