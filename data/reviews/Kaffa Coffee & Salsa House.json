{"text":"A truly wonderful coffee house with a manual espresso machine and freindly staff. This gem is litterally in an old house with lots of nooks and crannies for finding a cozy seat on a cool day to enjoy your espresso treat. Food menu is expansive but I never partook. Licensed and have wines and beer. When the weather is right, they have sangria too.

Fantastic staff with great coffee from an independent. This was right around the corner from my house in Calgary, so I spent a few Saturday mornings there with the Times or something else.

No WiFi and they like it that way, thank you very much.

Huge deck out front and some parking around the back.

Don't miss Kaffa."}
{"text":"I was after some lunch when I thought I would try Kaffa.  The house that has become the cafe was built in 1912.  There are 4 different rooms with tables in them.  The place was buzzing when I came in.  I was greeted by the girl behind the counter, who told me to just take my time deciding and got me some menus to look at so I could.  That was a automatic plus, most cafes I have been to I always feel rushed to order!  The cost of things here are pricey.  I decided on a spicy chicken burrito, which was $13 and a regular coffee, which was $2.60.  They only take cash and there isn't an ATM in the cafe.  The girl asked me where I planned to sit, I choose the table on the porch.  She gave me my mug and told me coffee is self serve.  I choose the dark roast.  I didn't wait long for my burrito, which was a decent size and came with a bunch of nacho chips, homemade salsa and cour cream.  The burrito was piping hot, the thing I didn't like was that a lot of the chicken was dark meat, I'm just not a fan of.  It was tasty though.  I loved the chill atmosphere here!  The patio looks like it would be awesome in the summer!  

I loved Kaffa, the service was excellent, the girls friendly.  The food was good, I just wish the prices were a bit more affordable.  I highly recommend checking out this place for your next cup'o joe!"}
{"text":"Yum.

One of my favorite memories of Kaffa Coffee House is going here with my brother a week after moving to Calgary from Detroit. We were blown away by the vibe and the promotion (coffee AND salsa house?!); we also loved that our frappuccinos were served in mason jars...very cool.

My second favorite memory of this place is going often on rainy days when I worked for the City-Parks department. My crew and I would get hot coffees (the Irish is my favorite) and hang out in the back room. I really like the room with the tree growing through it! Sweet!

The building is cool - it's apparently one of the oldest homes in the area - and the coffee, staff, and customers are great. 

Top notch!"}
{"text":"This weekend a friend and I stopped in at Kaffa for brunch. What I liked about this place was their set up. Kaffa is an old house that has been converted into a coffee shop/restaurant. There are tables scattered throughout different rooms on the inside, and on the outside, the patio is hidden amidst plants and trees. 

Aside from its set up, what makes Kaffa unique is its menu. In standard coffee shops, it's a rarity to be able to order a plate of nachos alongside your Chai latte or a Jamaican patty alongside your Italian soda. At Kaffa however, this dream is a reality.
 
We ordered a couple of lattes, a Biscotti and a date square and shared the treats. Although I, personally did not try their nachos, I *did* watch the group at the table next to us inhale a plate of them down to the very last bite. Damn they looked good ;) Right about now I should tell you that of the drinks and snacks that I *did* try, they were excellent. The drinks were prepared expertly and the snacks were homemade, fresh and delicious.

Aside from the aforementioned however, there are a couple of points of critique. The service was slow... *painfully* slow. And the prices, they were steep. 

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Kaffa, but when it comes to the service and pricing, there is definitely some room for improvement."}
{"text":"They really don't lie when they say coffee and salsa HOUSE because this place is actually located in an old school home.  

It has an incredibly unique atmosphere to it, being a house-turned-cafe.  I love that there are so many different places to sit, all of which have their own perks.  Some places are comfier than others, but some are quieter too.

Kaffa's got some wicked, lively staff, too.  They always seem to be smiling and happy to serve.  They're young enough that they are hip and individualistic, but still know the boundaries of their job.  I like when they come and have a mini conversation with you at your table.  I think it really adds to the allure of the house.

Kaffa serves great coffee and good food.  Like I said, it's a unique experience, one I recommend to any cafe lover!"}
