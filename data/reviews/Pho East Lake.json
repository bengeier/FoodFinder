{"text":"Delicious Vietnamese. The did here has a wonderful balance of spice, savory, sweet that I haven't had anywhere else. The beef is a better cut than midst places in Calgary, it could actually be a main and not part of larger dish.   The young coconut was delicious with large pieces of coconut.   2nd time here in two days and I'll be back."}
{"text":"So, my bar for Vientnamese food is set pretty high and this restaurant doesn't meet 'said' bar. However, after saying that, this place is right in the middle of the pack.   We went in on a Saturday afternoon and there was a respectable amount of people there for 1:00.  The restaurant is clean and decorated very sparingly with zero character. They are well suited for the industrial area of town. The servers are friendly but not around much.  We started with the spring rolls and they came out hot and crispy. They taste and look suspiciously, identical to the ones we buy at T&T Market. Traditionally they are served with lettuce leaves so you can wrap them and these were served with one limp piece underneath. We were not provided plates for our shared starter so I had to go up to the counter and ask for a few. They were totally mystified as to why I needed a plate.  My bun (vermicelli noodle bowl) was tasty, I had the Rainbow Combo and really enjoyed the charbroiled beef although I found the chicken flimsy. The serving size is big so I had to take some home to enjoy later. My Hubs had the Pho and ate it down to the last bite so I have to say he quite enjoyed it.   Here is where I stand when I think about returning; I can't go back until I have tried every other Vietnemese place in town because there has to be better out there."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the food is good. A popular place with the high school kids at lunch time.  The atmosphere is somewhat lacking and appropriate for the industrial area near where it is located rather than as a restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant in Alberta, without a doubt. Epic, fresh food and very friendly atmosphere. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to lunch places in Airdrie. It's pretty authentic Vietnamese food (not Westernized like most places), quick and best bang for you buck. And it also gets very busy, so that says a lot about this place. You have your choices of traditional dishes: pho, vermicelli with spring rolls, pork & rice - all of these get a thumbs up from me, so you can't go wrong with whatever you choose."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!   The best pho I've ever had, the broth is so flavourful and the staff is So accommodating!  My Fianc√© is on a Keto diet right now and ordering food is always brutal, but Pho East Lake was AMAZING about it! I didn't want to over complicate it too much and I always feel bad but I was blown away by The lady on the phone as she was simply incredible!  The best customer service I've ever had at ANY restaurant and the Best pho, oh my god and their subs, they are so good too. I've never been disappointed  Keep it up! And thank you Pho East Lake!"}
{"text":"Love the pho and the vermicelli bowls. The spring rolls are also wonderful. Very tasty and great prices. Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"I use to get take out from East Lake all the time, they were by far the best Vietnamese restaurant in airdrie.   Unfortunately, they have recently changed their take out portions. They are now half of what they use to be and what every other Vietnamese restaurant I have ever ordered from uses. It would have been fine, but they haven't changed the prices to reflect the portion change.  I ordered vermicelli and for the first time in my life I have actually finished my plate and was left wanting more. Half the pint size container was wilt lettuce, very disappointed that I have paid full price for half a meal.   Otherwise food was good, quality for take out has dropped. Guess I will be exploring the other Vietnamese restaurant available in airdrie from now on."}
{"text":"Once again I went for my favourite Vietnamese dish, Beef Sate which is number 31 at East Lake. The menu \"warns\" it's spicy but I really don't agree. However, the clear broth has a really nice flavour, rich in aromatics and beefy goodness.  The menu looked extensive as you'd expect and the service is prompt and very friendly. No visa under $15 or debt under $5. Prices are reasonable but servings are a bit smaller than most other places.   Is like to say I want to return to try other items but I know for me, it's number 31."}
{"text":"P32 Shrimp sate on rice noodle soup is absolutely amazing.   Beautiful tasting broth."}
{"text":"The pho was good, broth was flavourful! One of the better places I've tried since moving to Calgary over a year ago. (I had the rare beef pho with sate and veggie salad rolls.)  The menu options are average, but better than the last place I tried. Service was great. I will definitely be back!"}
