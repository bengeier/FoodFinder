{"text":"Food was almost inedible. Chicken schnitzel was almost black it was so over cooked. Falafels were over salted yet tasteless. Bread tasted like cigarettes (don't ask me how that's possible!) but not edible. Service was okay. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Tried this new place out on main street during lunch! They offer brunch as well :) 

I enjoyed the free warm pita appetizers with a garlic mint type of butter. Soo yummy.

I ordered a chicken shawarma and upgraded to their netherland fries. Both were super delicious and really hit the spot. 

Service was great and the look and feel to this restaurant was amazing. It has a very rustic barn modern feel. 

I will def. be back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"I ordered Chicken Souvlaki!
It was amazing! Yes 100% tasty!
Fast service & good portion & good price!
It was good for 2 people!

I will keep on trying other menu items, I trust the cook care of all food he present. Good take out container and staff were so friendly!
What else people want?!"}
{"text":"We really liked the decor here. Rustic and inviting. We went in for brunch. I thought my veggie omelette was really tasty as were the home fries. We also ordered the falafel late. They were ok but nothing special. I would come back and try more of the menu. A lady spoke to us, possibly owner or manager, she was very friendly. 
Coffee wasn't great. 
My four stars are really for the ambiance and the omelette."}
{"text":"Disappointing, bar tender was friendly, but other staff were not welcoming. 
Kabob was overdone.
Shawarma plate lacked meat, and they didn't bring bread with kabob and shawarma. 
Way overpriced
And no kids menu

I would go to Chez Tala, Paramount, or Taftan Kabab for way better food and half the price"}
{"text":"This new restaurant in downtown Newmarket is currently my favorite local spot. Newmarket has a dirth of innovative, inventive and high quality cuising. It is chain restaurant overkill, stuck in a rut. Aubergine acts like a karate chop on this tired local fare. Fresh, delicious, middle eastern cuisine with some european cuisine fused in. You will go home haven eaten a healthy, and more importantly, a delicious meal at a very reasonable price. Try the babaganoush, the falafal plate, the fresh and citrus flovours of the shepherds salad or shwarma and a number of pasta offerings. And since I grew up in the Netherlands, and know that you haven't really eaten french fries unless you have eaten them with mayo, I was more than pleased to find you can now get that in Newmarket...at Aubergine...get yourself over there folks...hurry..."}
