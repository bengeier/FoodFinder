{"text":"This place is a great local bar, a lot of history on the walls. Great place to eat a good sandwich or even pizza. I love the Cajun Chicken Sandwich with tater tots, it's the best !"}
{"text":"i just don't see the big deal with this place. i've heard about it for years and was actually excited to go here. and i do love to bet on the horses as well and they have off track betting. yes, there is alot of sports memorabilia, mostly college. lots of helmets in display cases. the bar itself feels dirty to me. it's dark and no frills at all. the tables and chairs are below average or average at best. the tvs suck. they have small tvs up towards the ceiling so your neck is cranked up. they have 2 large tvs that are kind of dark. there will usually be a couple of groups hogging those 2 big tvs, so if you want to see your game, you'll be stuck looking up at a small tv and those are usually a little dark or blurred. they have a separate area for horse betters. i don't like that they charge you to sit in that room. the only place to sit in that room is at your own personal tv like the 2nd level at turf paradise, so they charge you to sit there. the food was ok. we were there on a friday for all you can eat fish. well, after ordering several rounds, we found out it wasn't all you can eat. we had to pay for all of it. come on, 99% of places have it as all you can eat fish fry on fridays. the beer was cheaper. i have no idea about mixed drinks. the only reason i would go here is to walk in, look at the memorabilia and leave. also, if you have a large group, i would recommend somewhere else. these tables are small and you would have to push together a few tables. the bar only has a small area of tables."}
{"text":"Service horrible food OK, manager omg horrible this guy was the worst, he charged me $20 dollars for a shot of something they made the mistake on its usually $7.00 and he told me there is nothing he could do ....so if you want horrible service this place is it...what a rip off ..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted to try out this place as it is close to home...it looked nice from the outside but once we walked in...wow. It is so dated! The tv's are old and not in HD (if youre going to watch sports and spend money, you should at least have a nice t.v.). I don't think anyone was smoking...but that's all I could smell and I wasn't sitting next to anyone. My boyfriend and I are in our 20's and we were definitely the youngest there. This place has an older crowd (50's+). The bartender was ok...she looked at my boyfriends ID for about 5 minutes...it was kind of annoying. He has the new ID so I don't know what the problem was. We had one drink and an order of fries and just left. We really did not care for the atmosphere. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  All TVs are HD and flat screens...they will put on any game you want seeing that most Zonie's are transplants there will be a TV to suit your home team.  Food is good (sliders with pickles on the side, Best) and the service is very attentive and nice.  not to mention the sound dogs..a sound device so you can listen to your game at your table and not interrupt or hear anyone elses games.  great place.  it is rehabbed...so it's a little weird you fell like you are sitting in not really a sports bar...but as soon as they break it in Max's will take off.  give it a try.  strongly recommend it and I'm from the capital of sports bars, Chicago."}
{"text":"Can I give a no star rating? This may be a little more detailed than necessary but in order to get the point across, it must be said. Being a really big Nebraska Husker fan...I have spent many a dime in this place because it turns into Husker Mecca once Saturday rolls around. But, no more. I was treated rudely on a packed game day waiting for a table that I had already \"claimed\" by asking the folks that were leaving if we could have their table, they said \"of course, no one else has asked us\", so we made friends and began chatting it up and waiting for their game to end. Then, apparently the server felt it was her place to interject and tell me that another group of 10 was there first and deserved to have the 4 top table. I said, well, they should have gone to the seated guests and requested that they give them the table than. Not sure how or why this escalated into what it did but it ended up in me graciously gaving up the table of which i was already sitting at to the rude 19 year olds that caused the issue in the first place. Since they had such a large party they really should have come hours in advance in order to claim their own table for their giant group. That's what most people do. I was treated rudely by the server and she was making remarks under her breath (apparently she was having a bad day and was taking it out on me). Even my guy friend had to turn to her and tell her to \"watch her mouth\". This was a SERVER! Maybe someone should have reminded her that you shouldn't litterally chase customers away. Well, they lost a customer for life and I am one to recommend the places I like, hence, giving them more business. So it's too bad they won't be on that list. On top of all of the drama, their food is horrible, their service is horrible and their lack of consideration of loyalty and good patrons is beyond me. If you want a good Husker Bar for a Saturday game...go to Clancy's on Miller and Camelback. At least here you don't get treated like a child in an adult atmosphere and if you want to snag a table the old fashioned way, you're allowed."}
{"text":"We didn't know what to expect with this place, but we were pleasantly surprised. We actually only went there to watch a game since our cable was out. We got our drinks and Max's tater tots half off since it was happy hour. We got a Cobb salad and a party melt. Both were huge, yummy, and very well priced!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour! ($2.50 Wells) Great Staff! (Bartender Chris is the Man!) Great Food! (Can't beat a Jocko Burger, fries and a Drink!)"}
{"text":"I have been going to Max's for the past 30 years. The exterior is tired and the inside needs updated. I go there for the friendly service given by Christine, Chris, Adam and Shelby. The new manager Ray is a horrible tyrant. He fired Christine, who has been there 21 years. Now a sweaty, inexperienced boy tends the bar. Like the rest of the regulars I will not spend another dime there until Ray is gone!"}
{"text":"Nice bartender! First time there. Horrible food! Calamari was rubbery right out of the microwave. Definitely don't order that! Grade school cafeteria was not what I expected. And she said they got a new cook that just started... Uh oh....is he worse than the last one?? Bartender gave me a free Reuben. It was just Okay. Great place for off track betting on horse racing and cold Guinness at the right temperature!"}
{"text":"Great prices on drinks.  Great crowd, and good food.  Love this place to catch the games.   The best service in town!    The only thing keeping me from giving this place 5 stars is the kitchen puts out good food,  not great food.  But the food still is worth it.  Also, the TVs are older so the quality is not there,  but plenty of tvs to catch all the games."}
{"text":"This is in my hood, \"lol\" A good place for your \"OTB\" and will show any sports that can be asked to be seem. Happy hour has 2.00 off some of the starters and the draft beer is always good and cold. And I'm good with the \"it's dark and no frills at all.\" kind of place."}
{"text":"Spent super bowl Sunday at this great restaurant !! With a packed bar staff was on top of drinks like no other. Only down fall was a burnt cookie which with how packed the place was really wasn't bad!!  Great people and we can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Horrible..I've been there  before for a non profit org. Fundraiser and they were so helpful..I guess this time they wanted nothing to do with us and instead of telling  this instead of of telling us ahead that they need more time..they gave us cold shoulders..were super rude..everyone on they staff must have been told to do there best to get us out..cause instead of they helpful people and atmosphere last time..it was rude behavior towards us..no one came and said a single word to us and just gave dirty looks they whole time..look people I'm an adult a phone call to us to say you were unable to accommodate us would have been nice..instead we got cold shoulders dirty looks,and rude rude staff"}
{"text":"Nebraska Cornhusker Sports Bar. If you looking for a sports bar to watch Nebraska Football during the fall, Max's will have the game on all over the bar. Max's has good, affordable bar food, great wings, and cheap beer. Off-track betting is available, and they have a poker tournament once a week. This is a cool older bar with tons of sports memorbilia. Seems to be alot of regulars who are very friendly, not much on the singles scene though. Basically, a good sports bar in a cental location... 47th Ave, just south of Glendale."}
{"text":"Went there once to watch Big Ten Football, didn't like the nachos.  I went back a second time and got very poor service along with not so good a burger.  But I gave it a 3rd visit, and that will be my last.  The food is bad the service is bad and the place needs alot of work inside to improve its look from the 50's.  Sorry Max, but 3 strikes and you are out."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here yet but we plan on it. We sat on the bar side (huge place btw) and had a few drinks. Go during happy hour and it's $2 taps! They have some (kind of retro) cool decor with football helmets from (looks to be) all the colleges they could get a hold of as well as pro helmets. Staff was super friendly, the bartender was a lot of fun and there was a ton of sports on the TV's. We went on a Friday and the special was steak. Next time we will eat there. This place looks like the place to be on a Saturday or Sunday when football is on."}
{"text":"It's been many years since my husband and I have been to Max's and we are looking for a new place to watch football, so we went for dinner last night (Friday around 5pm).  It's a huge bar/restaurant with off track horse and greyhound betting.  There is not a lot of parking for a bar this big inside. There are TV's everywhere but they aren't very big TV's.  We have a 72 inch at home so these actually looked puny in comparison.  It took about 15 minutes for someone to come over to wait on us which is not very attentive when someone first sits down and we were at the table near the kitchen where the wait staff hang out so I know they saw us.I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich with fries  and my husband ordered the Club sandwich with fries.  The fries were the only good thing about both sandwiches.  My Philly was literally the worst I have ever had.  The meat was dry, the portion of the meat poor and the cheese was barely there.  They used chopped red and green bell pepper with the onion and I didn't like the red pepper taste at all.  As a matter of fact, that sandwich was so bad my stomach was really upset and I had heartburn all night and into this morning. My husband's Club was \"ok\" but the meat portion was not much for volume.  He is used to Club sandwiches stacked with meat.  The waitress we had was very attentive, and we had no complaint about her. As for drink pricing, I had a double vanilla vodka and diet coke and to my surprise they only charged me $2.50, for a double!  Must have been well pricing for happy hour.  My husband's Bud Light in a bottle was $3.  I know this place is a sports bar legend in the Phoenix area but we were really disappointed and won't be going back there."}
{"text":"Max's is THE place for L.A. Rams fans to watch football games on Sundays! The bar gives us our own private room every Sunday and our servers are always friendly & accommodating to our large group. I'm not a big fan of bar food, but the food here is good and I especially like the patty melts, Reubens, onion rings & fries. The tater tots are really tasty...but spicy, so order accordingly. The main part of the bar is big and spacious and there are sports helmets everywhere. They also have a betting room, decent area for smokers outside, and ample parking, although it does get tight on Sundays. This place is a hidden gem off the main blvd. and we're so happy to have found it last year! Thanks, management, you guys ROCK."}
{"text":"Great bartenders great atmosphere if you enjoy betting snd drinking. Bartender Chris is the best!!  Chris hope all is well in your world"}
{"text":"We only stopped here to have a beer before dinner and too check out this place. The TV situation is very 1970's, but there are a few other bigger TV sets scattered about, none very modern or in HD. Would not watch football here, but i did win a few bucks on a random horse bet. That area is of course populated by Glendale's not so finest and be careful as the drunks dart through the hallways to make their losing bets.      The Happy Hour was in effect on the weekend and the domestics were 3 bucks each. As we were leaving, cop cars were screeching through and a chopper was overhead looking for somebody. It is likely that is the type of crowd that enters this bar - which does have an impressive selections of football helmets and an ugly mascot to boot."}
{"text":"This place had it's day about thirty years ago.  It's become a shell of it's glory days when giant satellite dishes were the only means to watch your favorite teams on Sundays.  It seems like the emphasis now has shifted to the off track betting option.  They seem unwilling or unable to upgrade their televisions to that of an HD level which is surprising and disappointing.  While the TV's may be the same ones from thirty years ago, the volume of them doesn't make up for their lack of quality.  I found myself searching for a watchable broadcast that wasn't available here.  I suppose those who do go here are thankful the viewing isn't in black and white."}
{"text":"Max's is MY NEIGHBORHOOD BAR.  Just one light south of me. On the suggestion of my boyfriend's coworker, we went there for a Max Burger...BOMBDIGGITY! Cooked to perfection, deliciously loaded with lettuce, onion, tomato, jalapeno... accompanied by homemade chips that must have floated down from heaven on gossamer wings - with house dipping sauce. One bite and we were hooked! While my boyfriend and his crew flipped the Orangewood townhomes I happily kept them in the grub, making regular runs to Max's for specialty burgers, fries and sodas. Quick, accurate, efficient service - and Max's crew knew my name and made me feel welcome. After projects, the flip team assembled at Max's to discuss the next flip over a tasty offering of wings, chips, salads and burgers.   Max's service and product are top notch. The walk through the gallery of national college helmets and NFL helmets (search hard for that Dallas one, Cowboy fans, but you will find it!) alone is worth the trip. OTB, great food, fantastic service and welcoming atmosphere make Max's my Favorite Place to be!"}
{"text":"Ended up here to make a bet on the horses running the Kentucky Derby. We stayed for a couple of cocktails and appetizer. To my surprise it's rather spacious, not loud and many TV screens to watch sports. What's great about the TV's is that they are muted....yay!!!  Today was very crowded because of race, service was a little slow because only three servers were working the floor. We had the home made chips with chipotle dipping sauce. Very delish! The bloody Mary was spicy good. They have Lagunitas, Guinness and others on tap. We will return to try out the menu. A great place for OTB."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We came in because we were in the area and wanted a couple more drinks, but we are SO glad to have found this gem. Lots of TVs, great service, and a bunch of sports history on the walls and in display cases. We could have spent so much time, just checking out all the memorabilia!! Chris, the bartender, was so amazing. He treated us as though we had been coming there for years. Bare in mind, this means a lot of things! He was sincere and sarcastic and endearing but feisty! We loved every minute of it!! We didn't have food, but the drinks and service will bring us back!! We aren't very close to this bar, but we are looking forward to another night spent playing pool, hanging out on the patio taking with regulars, and sipping beers with Chris!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Max's for over 10 years. It's got pro's and con's that are to be weighed out before deciding to visit this place.    10 years ago this place was awesome!  I have to say... it could use some updating. The chairs are old and hurt your butt and the TV'S need to be replaced.  It's a bummer when we go to watch a football game and the screen is fuzzy. With TV'S being so cheap it would not take much to replace some of the older ones.    The food is hit or miss. There are some things that are great and others not so much. The homemade chips are delicious!   We have always had great service! Friendly and attentive and the management has always stepped up on the occasion of an issue.    If you are looking for a neighborhood sports bar then this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"I love this place! It was a lot of sports stuff everywhere & the beer is always ice cold! Cajun chicken sandwich with tater tots are the best!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. com, Chris is one of the coolest bar tenders ever! 1.75 drafts cant be beat. Try the Jalepeno and cheese tator tots they are delicious! Also the beer is as cold as it gets."}
{"text":"So we went here every week back in the early 90's. Only place in town that had all the NFL games. Oh the stories I could tell! This place has done a major transformation over the years and is now somewhat family friendly! Still show NFL games but their TV's are SOOOO Freakin outdated that is the one thing they really need to address. Good Service good food will be back sometime..."}
{"text":"I only go here on Saturdays to watch the Huskers because I love the gameday environment. The \"sea of red\" comes to Max's to yell at the tv's as if we were in the stands. In addition, they have a drawing at halftime and at the end of the game in which every person in the place enters their prediction for the score. Winners get a gift card. If nobody gets the halftime score, both gift cards go to the end of game winner. Ties are drawn out of a hat by a randomly picked child in the room. Husker specials include 'Husker nachos' (red & white chips) & any draft beer made into a \"red\" beer for no extra charge. My wife & son love it here too, always asking, \"can we go to Max's?\" Its been remodeled since I first started coming here in 1997. The memorabilia is awesome. FB helmets everywhere!"}
{"text":"Good old school sports bar! Great place to watch all the games. Food is bar food but the atmosphere is cool"}
{"text":"What a find!!  Visiting from Seattle area and needed a place to watch the Seahawks game.  Food was excellent (Pork Sandwich) and the room was inviting.  Great crowd gathers here but the exceptional service from our wait staff, Chelsey, made it perfect."}
{"text":"Good food and the service was fantastic.  Our waitress recommend the spicy chicken sandwich with stuffed tater tots.  Fantastic!! very cool place and if you like to bet the track, it's all here."}
{"text":"Some of my friends gathered together and came to visit me during my lil stay on the westside.  Where did we go?  Max's.  All. night. long.  over and over again.    We had a ton of fun at this place.  It's quirky as fuck.  There are football helmets in glass cases that line the hallways.  Murals of screaming sport fans along the walls.  Ol codgers belly up to the bar and yell at the horses on the screen \"that's it baby, right there, keep it going.\"  So entertaining!  The beers where ridiculously cheap.  One of the times we went, we were there all day and all night and the tab was like $12.      I haven't tried the food there."}
{"text":"This place is a little off the beaten path...and so is it's location.   We got winners, we got losers Chain smokers and boozers And we got yuppies, we got bikers  We got thristy hitchhikers And the girls next door dress up like movie stars   Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar   We got cowboys, we got truckers  Broken-hearted fools and suckers And we got hustlers, we got fighters  Early birds and all-nighters And the veterans talk about their battle scars   Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar The waitstaff was freaking awesome! She looked a littel like Julie Bowen who is MILF The food was good too!"}
{"text":"I've come here several times because my family likes this place. I personally would never come outside of them because I have NEVER dealt with such a rude, nasty staff. There are two male bartenders that clearly hate their job and have no problem taking it out on their customers. It's unfortunate, because I like to to extremely well but tonight my bartender will get $0."}
{"text":"the place is in a weird location. l like all the college footbal helmets..large patio. foos is good and very resonable service is fine. i love the spicy fries. you can bet the horses and dog races here.. lots of regulars go here,wish they had one on the eastside of town."}
{"text":"One of my employees mentioned that this place was nearby and had lunch specials.  Being just a bit off the main roads I had never seen it.    When you enter it is not immediately clear where to go.  Off to the left is the OTB area with it's special seating and individual TVs.  In the center is a bar that apparently goes unused during week days and off to the right is the main dining area with a rectangular bar that seems dedicated to the horse folks during the day.  To the right of that (East end) there is also a smoking area with it's own set of TVs and food service is available there too.  I sat in the main dining area.  Weekdays there are food specials for lunch and dinner as well as the choice to order off the menu.  I chose the daily special of a chicken Parmesan sandwich which at $5 was not a bad deal but at $7-8 would not have been that great.  It came with steak fries which were nice and crispy on the outside.    Service was quite good and friendly.  There are a lot of TVs but many of them are not LCD and mounted up high where it is hard on your neck to see them.  I was told later that I could request almost any sports game being shown to be on any TV I chose (including the lower placed LCDs) as long as nobody already had made a choice for that one.  Even at lunch time there were a lot of regulars in the place.  During baseball season I will probably go back on a semi regular basis to be able to watch day games with my lunch.  I will most likely also try some of the regular menu items."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to the place. I live right by and have been wanting to go for sometime now. The parking is always full so I thought it would be a great place. As it turns out it was a total disappointment. The bar tender is rude and not very accommodating to customer needs. I ordered a Long Island and it was the worst Iv had in my life. You could taste nothing but this nasty liquor that I couldn't even pinpoint! I had asked the waitress politely if there was anything they could do she was too timid to even ask him, stating I should talk to him as he mixed it appropriately. He came by 20 min later and asked me how I felt about it stating if I don't like how he makes it not his fault. I simply asked him if he could maybe add some mango or raspberry flavoring and his response was it won't be a Long Island and walked away. He came back slammed the drink on the table and walked away. It was still horrible. But trying to be polite I had a few sips and left it without further complaining.   Me and my friend ordered their meat lovers pizza which looked delicious! When we took a bite it was way to dry and tasted rather stale. I guess it wasn't the best or the worst Iv had. During our dinner the bartender walked in form the patio yelling about a customer who was complaining about having to wait 30 min for a glass of wine and his words exactly \" not my damn problem you know where the bar is\"  To say I was not impressed would be a understatement. The decor is horrible, for a sports bar TVs are wayy behind on technology and quality. Honestly I wouldn't waist my time or money on this place."}
{"text":"I've been to Max's many times over the years. I've always had their club sandwich which never disappointed me. Last Friday my wife and I tried the fish fry and we were very disappointed! We received one and a half pieces of fish. Who ever heard of half a piece? The fish wasn't that great either and the cole slaw was even worse! Last time for us!!!  :-("}
{"text":"I have been to Max's a couple of times, but went again last night.  Brandon and his trainee Lulu waited on us. Service was excellent and very attentive.  We ordered the wings, honey hot and medium. Definitely loved the honey hot. The sauce was excellent.  The medium was also good, but was your typical sauce.  The wings were a great size and had lots of meat. I couldn't even finish the whole plate. We ordered 2 Dos XX and they were super cold. And only $3.50! I will definitely be back. Just wish they would upgrade the TVs."}
{"text":"An old school sports bar with very affordable drink specials. The wings and fries are amazing! Bartenders Chris and Christine are real with you and provide amazing service. Only thing that I don't like is that they play old school rock on the speakers at all times even when the games are on. I think it would provide a much better atmosphere if we could hear the games on the speakers. Overall one of Glendale's hidden gems and will be coming back for years!"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere for a sports fan looking for a cool little bar. Chris is the man. He is a character, that you just need to appreciate. Even the cooks are awesome people. Very great environment and food. Always order the tater tots! Out of this world"}
{"text":"Good prices on the drinks and the food is not too expensive either. I've only had the buffalo chicken wrap and the tater tots, but both were better than most sports bars will offer you. The service is great too and the staff is friendly  and lively. The TV's could use a an upgrade as mentioned in other reviews, but the atmosphere does remind me of the fun bar and grill restaurants that I visited with my family as a kid, so the tv selection is not really that big of a deal."}
{"text":"I highly recommend that no one comes here especially if you are disabled or with someone who is disabled. They completely discriminate against individuals with disabilities. It is disgusting and distasteful. The manager is the worst and does nothing to make sure his customers are treated equally. The servers completely dismiss you and try to dodge serving you as much as they can and when they do they are rude and take hours to bring out food let alone beverages. The owner needs to check his disgraceful ass staff and management. If I could give no stars I would!!!!!"}
{"text":"\"In honor of Colorado and Washington, the fourth quarter special will be liquid marijuana for $4.20\"   I picked the right place to watch the super bowl.   This bar is off the beaten path. You can drive up and down Glendale all day and not notice it unless you're using a GPS. Once you get there, you'll see it's HUGE! And retro. Like, my dad probably came here at my age. It's that old.   The decor is legit, with so much sports memorabilia you look through. They have decades old helmets from seemingly every college team in the game. There's a baseball room as well. This place almost doubles as a museum!  All the drinks are cheap, and there's a full menu of just about anything you could want. It's nothing gourmet, just old-fashioned bar food. TVs aren't the best quality, but they are everywhere, so you can watch whatever you want. Glendale gets pretty boring, so I'm really glad to find this place to break the monotony."}
{"text":"I went to this bar with a my friend  and they ordered the vegetable wrap.  I ordered a drink only,  thank goodness.  Because when my friend bit into their wrap there was  a big hard mystery object piece in the food. It was disgusting. Even one of the waitresses seen it and agreed.  So beware of the the food and the service here.  Not good at all."}
{"text":"I've gone to Max's twice. They have decent draft specials, but not much else. The bartenders seemed bored, no real energy in the place. I suppose if you like to gamble or like sports it would be ok. They have lots of flat screen tv and gambling type machines, etc.. Not much of a crowd though. Bleh atmosphere. More of a local place to meet 1 friend for a beer once, than a hangout kinda place for a regular meetup."}
