{"text":"Alex the bartender is wonderful and is really key to making this place what it is. The drinks, atmosphere and atmosphere are all sublime."}
{"text":"This bar is awesome. I'm from the Chicago area and love this place. Alex and David could not be more informative and personal bartenders! By the way, Matthew J. - I was in the bar last night and you weren't there before midnight! It was actually 2 minutes past midnight. Really... a one star review because you came in after the bar closed? Not a fair review at all!"}
{"text":"Stopped by last night a little before midnight and was rudely told by the manger and bartender that they had already done last call, only bar open in a hotel and did last call before midnight???"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time at The well known Ledger Bar located inside the Metropolitan at the 9 Hotel.  I was pleased and surprised by the amazing service I received from the bartender. His name was Chad and I highly recommend him for everyone who goes to the Ledger. He takes his time in perfecting everyone of his drinks for his customers. Next time you stop by for a drink inside the 9 stop by The Ledger, I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love this bar at this amazing hotel!  The bar is on the mezzanine level that is open and looks down on the lobby and grand entrance.    The bartender, a female (wish I could remember her name, newly engaged, lived in Cleveland her entire life) was great!"}
{"text":"For happy hour, there's 2 places you can grab a drink in The 9 in the cold weather: Adega, or Ledger Bar, as Azure is closed in winter and Vault doesn't open until 9pm. The Ledger bar is a little inconspicuous. Once in the elevator of The 9, there's easy buttons directing to its major attractions...but none for Ledger Bar. Take the elevator to Floor 2, and you won't miss it. The vibe is classy and fun, and it doesn't feel like a hotel bar. I can't wait to come back here, even when its not cold.  Secluded against the mezzanine, Ledger has a modern, rustic vibe accented with deep wood elements and interesting glass lighting fixtures. When the sun goes down, the dim lighting creates a really sleek atmosphere. The seating is limited, which is legitimately the only downfall.   The drinks at Ledger are strong, and completely worth being a little pricy. Try the Bees Knees (gin + local honey!), and don't be shy to ask the bartender for suggestions from their extensive cocktail menu. They know what they're doing!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to grab a nice drink with a friend. I stumbled on the bar the other night and the bartender was really kind and accommodating. He mentioned that he didn't have the ingredients, but he made an awesome substitute. I will come again and try other cocktails. I wonder if they can make a French 75?"}
{"text":"While attending the Short Sweet Film Fest this weekend, we stopped in for a drink and a bite.  Wow!  The house Cabernet, B-Side out of Napa, was  delish. So smooth and velvety to start with just enough tannin to touch a Cab but not give you cottonmouth.  The Charcuterie board was elegantly presented and easily managed by my husband and I.  A nice relaxed \"barrister\" type atmosphere with elegant rustic accents like chunk granite coffee tables and leather club chairs.  Beautiful view out the front window of The \"9\" of the red brick Schofield across the street. (On my bucket list). All framed by the big crystal chandeliers from the lobby. Ledger is a balcony above it. Small and cozy. I want to go back for a nightcap."}
{"text":"One of the favourite places in Downtown CLE, this second-floor hideaway is great for people-watching! An excellent food menu specific to Ledger Bar is available, and patrons may also choose from selections at Adega.  A key feature is the collection of original bank ledgers on the shelves, some of which date to the late 1800s when Cleveland Trust Company was founded. Open every day M-Th 4p to Midnight, 4p to 2a Fri & 2p to 2a Sat."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited the Ledger bar two weeks in a row.  The first time we had \"P\" as our bartender. He was awesome! I can't remember the name of our bartender the second time. But he was awesome as well.  These gentleman had great personalities and excellent service skills.  We ordered Lobster Mac and cheese and shrimp & grits while we were waiting to go to a Yelp Elite event at the Alex Theater.  Both dishes were delicious!  Plenty of lobster in my mac and cheese.  The shrimp and grits had a good flavor, but it reminded me of an etoufee.  There was a gravy like sauce with grape tomatoes in it as opposed to a tomato or Trinity based sauce that I'm used to seeing in that dish.  We got the Nutella Pot De Cr√®me both visits and you should too!  The bartender was even kind enough to hold on to our food while we went to our event.  Great experience overall!"}
