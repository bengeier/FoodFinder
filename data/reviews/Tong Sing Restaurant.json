{"text":"a few years ago i had lunch combo here. i got argued with an employee, the tip of 15% is too small. So he forced me to pay 20% tips at lunch. I complained but his attitude was so bad. A tall man employee, of couse the dmployee was a chinese. It was my experience there. Food was ok ."}

{"text":"Let's talk dim sum.

Their \"2$/dish between 8am-11am\" advertisement on their website is nonexistent. It's not really about the money but the fact that I felt lied to.

Their dishes tasted nice and was slightly pricey. Also, their steamed short ribs weren't thoroughly cooked so it was pretty tough to eat."}
{"text":"This is my first impression of the place and it doesn't sound like a good one. 

First of all, we occupied three tables to celebrate a birthday.  Some of the tables didn't get the same food as us and my sister found a bug on her soup. 

Overall, the food is not good and the service can use some improvement. They do need an easy access for disability and old age people because the stairs won't attract us back there."}
{"text":"Je suis allé là pour un banquet à 30$ par personne, excluant alcool et pourboire.  À leur crédit, il faut admettre que c'est pour le moins copieux.  Tout le monde à trop mangé et il en est resté.  Malheureusement, la qualité des mets n'était pas toujours au rendez-vous.  Beaucoup trop de panure et de friture, à tel point qu'il était parfois difficile de savoir de quelle viande il était question.  Peu de légumes, ce qui est dommage, car ceux que l'on nous a servis étaient délicieux.  En somme, une nourriture assez commune, mal balancée, mais néanmoins bonne si on est fan du genre.  Les prix devraient être revus à la baisse, car ça demeure un peu cher comparé à d'autres endroits semblables."}
{"text":"The shrimp ball, shiu meis, squid and pork buns were better than expected, other items were flat in taste.  It was an overall good experience and will return.  $40 for 2."}
