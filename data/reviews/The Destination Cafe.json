{"text":"Warm and caring service, well-made food, and a comfortable inviting space make this SUCH a wonderful spot for pre-work breakfast, lunch or an early dinner: I *LOVE* this cafe since Gaston took it over!  Gaston and his kitchen staff are warm, welcoming, and always SO happy to see you.  Given the choice Gaston would love for everyone to STAY and eat at the cafe - he told me it feels like having friends over for lunch, which he loves.  That said he's always happy to pack it up for takeout if you don't have time to spare to stay.    Gaston puts such care and attention into his food preparation, and he is visibly proud of the food he serves.   He uses fresh ingredients (stop by in the morning and you can see!), he creates his own recipes, and he welcomes and listens to feedback from his customers.  Gaston has always been gracious with making small changes on the fly (e.g., adding or skipping an ingredient  you dis/like in quesadillas or sandwiches), and he's always trying out new menu items to see how they fare with customers.  If you're lucky he'll have his free homemade chrysanthemum tea brewed when you stop in - you should DEFINITELY ask for a cup if you enjoy loose teas!  Such care is shown in the way things are taken care of at The Destination Cafe.  The cafe itself is cozy, always has nice music playing in the background (no harsh radio with commercials), and it has a nice collection of furniture - my favourites are the comfy couch in the window, and the door re-purposed into a table-top at the back!    I always feel welcome to enjoy a meal, or to just sit and read in the afternoon sunshine with a coffee/tea and a book - don't miss stopping by this wonderful spot if you have the chance!"}
{"text":"This cafe is nice and simple.  It has a clean look with brick walls and white furniture.  What stood out to me is the size of the tables, actually.  It's nice to work in a cafe sometimes and when you have a table the size of a large cookie, it makes things challenging.  These tables are bigger than most so you can really spread out.  It wasn't busy on a Wednesday afternoon which made for a productive business meeting without distractions.    I had a chai latte which tasted the same as any other.  They have a small selection of baked goods and menu items but it does the trick.  The simplicity of it all makes it feel a it like a small town cafe with the luxury of being located in the historic Lorraine Building.  Review 16 for Yelp's 30 Day Challenge - Nov 2012"}
