{"text":"If you are looking for the best steak in the Gaston/Mecklenburg area the Woodshed in Stanley is it. Fresh cuts from filets, to t-bones, to prime rib; family friendly (with a miniature train that circles the seating areas), full salad bar; and above all is extremely clean. Two key components: greater price = high quality cuts and taste. Secondly: expect to spend a good portion of your evening there.  It has been a family staple for special events (birthdays, etc) for 25 years. Ask for Phyllis."}
{"text":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!!! I've never been a huge fan of this place, but my mom loves it and I admit that the quality of the beef is great, so this was her choice for dinner. The ONLY thing I loved about this place is the tomato and onion sandwiches on the salad bar. BUT they are no longer on the salad bar, they are now 1.99 each. If you don't like ranch, bleu cheese, or 1000 island dressing, you have the very upscale choice of Kraft dressings still in the squeeze bottle (REALLY?!)  It took 30 minutes for our entrees to arrive and when they did they were stone cold. The mushroom gravy had the cold and congealed look to it. My chicken was only lukewarm. My mother's beef tips were lukewarm and overcooked. My husbands filet had a chill to it almost as if it had just come from the cooler.  From previous experience here, if you send something back (because this is a RECURRING issue) it takes 30 more minutes. So we just had the waitress take it away and asked for our bill. When she took the food to the back she came back and said you're right that food was COLD. No manager ever came out to apologize and  we were charged $9 each for a mediocre salad bar with bottled dressings and then left to go find a REAL meal with HOT food.  Avoid this place, it was something great back in the day, but I have not had a good meal here in over 5 years and if I'm going to pay $30 for a steak I'd prefer a better atmosphere (one that doesn't blast country music down my throat and hasn't completed an update on the place since 1985) and hot steak that wasn't served to me on a plate like the Western Sizzling used."}
{"text":"way over rated and over priced. ..even for Stanley..food is good but way over priced..."}
{"text":"Way overrated wait in line for an hour to have a nice steak unseasoned or marinated not worth the money go to Logans"}
{"text":"The one place I have eaten each time I spent the day in Stanley.  I actually live in Lowesville, but have to go to Stanley for business often enough. Good food and prices and good portion size."}
{"text":"Great prime rib and fantastic salad bar.  Love the tomato and onion sandwiches too. Friendly service and Wonderful vintage decor. This steakhouse takes you back to a much simpler era when we all were not so rushed."}
{"text":"I have been to the Woodshed 4 times and never disappointed.  Normally I get the Ribeye which is always thick, flavorful, juicy, cooked perfectly, and just a tad fatty.  They know it's a fatty cut and make-up for it with a slightly larger portion.  I also had my first Prime Rib here and enjoyed it.  Great rub and cooked perfectly.  Salad bar is laking, nothing more then what I remember at from grade school.  But then again, I am not coming here for the salad bar.  An update on the 'brown-bag' policy....  Stanley residence recently passed a measure to allow beer, wine, and liquor by the drink sales in town.  The Woodshed now has a limited selection of beer and wines."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, the food is consistently excellent.  If you want a great waitress, ask for Phyliss.  The filet mignon is my favorite steak on the menu and be sure not to miss the tomato and onion sandwich.  Skip the appetizers!  Very casual but expect long waits on the weekend.  And each steak is cooked to order and with the crowds, yes it can take a while.  Don't expect a quick dining experience.  Be sure to ask to see the dessert tray, the cakes are homemade and to die for."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service!   Def. try the NEW York Strip if you are a steak lover."}
{"text":"We try to get to The Woodshed twice a year as a nice splurge and a nice getaway from the kids.  This is the ONLY place that cooks my picky husband's steak to perfection!  At other restaurants, if he says well done they insist on butterflying the steak, but The Woodshed can cook a steak well done without slicing into it and it is STILL as juicy and easy to cut as an overripe tomato!  The complimentary sandwiches are legendary even though they are simplistic.  And the salad bar is better than average, having toppings that a chain restaurant simply will not carry.  I always have the tips; yummy!  And my husband gets the horseradish sauce while I get the mushroom gravy.  The steak doesn't really need either, but it's nice to have around.  The dessert tray is so very tempting that this is the ONLY restaurant where we usually get dessert!  One time we opted to give another steak house in the area a chance (Old Stone Steak House) but we were VERY, VERY disappointed in comparison!!  Small portions, outrageous prices for what you got and very awful service.  But at The Woodshed I can't remember a time when I went without tea or requested items.  And I agree with another reviewer; if Phyllis is there, ASK FOR HER!  She's spectacular for keeping you fat and happy!  LOL."}
{"text":"Great place to eat!! I love the tomato and onion sandwiches.  I just hate they charge for them now. Never had a bad meal or service here.  We will continue to come back.  I am now the Duke of this Place."}
{"text":"The Woodshed is, literally, one of two restaurants where I will order a steak. That's because I have been spoiled by the splendor of the Woodshed's seasoning & flawless execution of steaks. Everything else is just vying for second place!   You'll start with the salad bar. The ingredients are all chopped & prepared fresh and continually refreshed throughout the night. I'm not a huge salad fan, but I make an exception when I'm at the Woodshed because it's just that good. All of the steaks I've ever had at the Woodshed have been seasoned to perfection and cooked flawlessly. (And if you ever have an issue, Bill [the owner] IS ALWAYS there and will make it right.) Prime rib is definitely my favorite though. I usually go for the creamy horseradish sauce and mushroom gravy to pair with the prime rib because they're both just too delicious to have to choose one!   My only issues with The Woodshed are just that the layout of the restaurant does not lend itself well to pre-seating waiting. The entry hallway and hallways towards the front restrooms are usually lined with people waiting to be seated. It can be a little uncomfortable and difficult to navigate. Also, on the weekend, the wait can get pretty out of control pretty quickly. But, going early in the evening and/or avoiding Saturday nights usually eliminates those issues!"}
{"text":"The Woodshed is the one of the few places that know how to cook a steak properly!  Their steaks are my favorite and I only order it here!  The salad bar is passable, nothing special.  The service is always good and friendly and the atmosphere is very quaint.  We've never had a bad meal at the Woodshed and we're willing to drive a little farther in order to get a good steak!"}
{"text":"Easily the best steakhouse in Gaston County. The prime rib is expensive, but the best that I've had anywhere, and I've tried many. The service is phenomenal, and they also have an awesome salad bar. The Queen Anne's lace cake is to die for. My favorite restaurant in the world."}
{"text":"We went to Woodshed last night to celebrate our son's birthday.  We have been there many, many times.  We had not been in about 2 years because we live about 40 minutes away.  When we arrived, I immediately noticed the musty odor of the restaurant.  The decor of the restaurant is old and outdated.  I do not think it has changed in the 25+ years that we have been going there.  The carpet in the front room and the paneling in the dining room desperately need to be replaced.   The wait staff is almost the same as it has been in the past.  Our server was someone that had waited on us many times.  In the past she was prompt and attentive.  Last night she was nice but we had to wait on everything.  We were almost done with our salads when we got water and our other beverages.(there were only 3 of us)  Then there was a long wait before our steaks finally arrived.  At the end of the meal, we were going to order dessert but we were told they were all out.  WHAT??  They usually bring out a tray of homemade desserts and you pick what you want.  Could they actually be out of everything?  Hmmmm  The food was good.  The salad bar was fresh and well stocked.  They steaks were cooked perfectly.  It's not as good as it was a few years ago but we might stop in again if we are in the area.  We probably will not make a special trip to Stanley for it anymore. The building needs work and so does the staff."}
{"text":"Best salad bar around! It comes with each meal and they will give you another plate to go back a second time. Absolutely love this place. Great staff and wonderful food!"}
{"text":"This was an unusual  woodshed visit for us in May.  Went to celebrate an anniversary with our family.  Party of 4.   Filet mignon was ordered medium.  It was presented as rare.   After flagging down someone, the hostess took it back to the kitchen for us.  The young hostess returned the steak and asked me to check it.  It was still rare but charred on the outside at this point!  She took it back again but an older lady (not our server) brought the steak back, sat it on the table, and WALKED OFF.   My husband had to ask her to stand by and let me check it again.  At this point the steak had lost all of its flavor and was burnt on the outside.  I could not eat the steak.   Because of the bad experience thus far, neither was my husbands prime rib cooked to order but he didn't say anything.  It was ordered medium and was well done.  It was dry and not edible.   We have had numerous large parties and family outings at this restaurant but it will be a long time before we go back and spend that kind of money on steaks that are not worth eating.     As we left the restaurant, the young hostess had her face buried in her cell phone and didn't even look up at us.   Again, this is not the norm for our experiences at this restaurant.  But when customers are not satisfied and do not eat their meal, they should not be charged full price.   We spent $60 on 2 salad and  2 potatoes."}
{"text":"A totally \"stuck in the 70s\" Western-themed steakhouse, complete with dark woods and a 70s-style salad bar. The food's good, though and the staff are \"hometown friendly\". It's no Morton's or Peter Luger's, but it's better than most of the chains!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food today doesn't come close to how it was a couple of years ago. The food is not worth cost. They no longer offer the once popular tomato and onion sammies. Service is decent. Longhorn is the steak house The Woodshed wants to be."}
{"text":"Decor is horrible. Smells old too Has not been updated in years.  Service was not great.  It was not busy and my husbands soup was forgotten. She did apologize though. Steaks were ok. Not the best I have ever had. We won't be back.  Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Always great food! The steaks are so tender, salad bar always full, and the service is always great. We have never had any kind of complaint here."}
{"text":"WILL DRIVE FOR FOOD!....especially to this hidden gem about 45 minutes from Charlotte in the small town of Stanley, NC.  To begin your experience, ask for Phyllis.  She is a sweet, grandmotherly type and is just exceptional!  Starting with the shrimp cocktail, Phyllis brought us out some \"hot\" and \"buried in x-hot\" homemade cocktail sauce (\"Hot\" was sinus opening plenty hot).  Excited to see that the Woodshed now offers a SMALL PORTION MENU (which includes one-trip salad, potato, and bread) we ordered the 5 oz of filet tips.  Phyllis brought them out cooked to perfection (of course), along with some homemade mushroom gravy AND homemade horseradish sauce.  OMG!!!  We also had one of the best baked sweet potatos that I have ever experienced.  But do not stop there...dessert is a must!  The strawberry cake and the chocolate cake that has white icing and has some type of special name(?!?) are both to die for....  One side note:  It's a \"Brown Bagging\" type of place so don't forget your bottle of red wine to complete your what I call \"little piece of heaven\" experience!"}
{"text":"Drove to Stanley because we heard the place was good.  Waited awhile before the waitress came to get our drink order.  I ordered off the regular size menu and my companion the small portion menu but the two plates were the same size, then her well done steak was medium rare.  Add to that that everything there is overpriced and you get a bad experience.  Won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Very long wait.  Waited over 45 minutes to eat once we ate salad.  Food was meh.   Definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Great homemade desserts and the food is good too.  Local favorite that does good steaks, good service and no frills. Second only to Lineburgers. (Sorry, guys.) Desserts here are definitely better. Lineburgers has a full bar."}
{"text":"Who would have guessed? Through the door and down a brick wall lined hall is a treasure of a steakhouse anywhere. I have been to Don Shula's, Ruth Chris, Morton's, Christy's... I can add to this list until I'm blue in the face. You simply won't get a better steak. Here's something even better, you don't need to dress up like you're walking into a NYC restaurant. This is Stanley.   While Stanley might be the train and mill town that time has forgotten - don't let that fool you about the quality that can come out of it. Price is high as one might expect from a steakhouse. My 15oz filet was worth every penny.   Great for kids too - they have other options other than the steak. There's the famous tomato sandwich too. Unlimited salad bar comes with each order. There is a limited selection of alcohol since the passing of the liquor sale law in the city.  Enjoy these good eats!"}
{"text":"Supermarket quality steaks and lackluster bread which is really a toasted hamburger bun.  And don't miss the \"mader 'n' onyun sammich\" on the salad bar - blech.  Save your money and go to Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"Save your money. Was there on a Saturday night. Service was good, salad bar nothing special. However, ordered the prime rib thinking that would be hard to screw up....Unless you dump five pounds of salt on the outside. Actually had to cut the outside of the slice of prime rib off to get to the edible inside section. Gave a bite of the outside to the wife and she actually had to spit it out it was THAT salty. No butter for the baked potato, waitress pointed me to the basket of Country Crock. Read previous reviews and was concerned about driving 90 minutes to meet for relatives birthday celebration. Certainly not worth the drive or money spent."}
{"text":"Service wasn't the best. My wife's salmon was dry and has no flavor. My prime rib had a lot of fat and gristle. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"We called ahead for a  Reserved Birthday party it took two hours before we were served our food.We were cancelling our orders and fixing to leave when they finally brought out the food. We also had small kids that were being exceptionally good for the long wait. And Bill the owner kept telling them to sit down!  I will never go back they didn't even knock off anything on the bill. Never once they said they were sorry for the long wait. Also the Lobster bisc soup was  spoiled you could not even eat it!"}
{"text":"We took our entire family here for a nice dinner to say a proper goodbye to my cousin who will be leaving for the air force next week.  We have been fans of the woodshed for many years, and have always recommended their establishment to others.  HOWEVER, last night was a horrible experience.  the waitress showed no interest in our table (and it was a slow thursday evening), everyone at the table received cold food, super dry potatoes, hard bread and all agreed that we should have saved both the time and money spent traveling to stanley.  And please keep in mind, we are a simple family that is easy to please - i have NEVER heard my grandfather complain about food on the table until last night. the woodshed needs to revert back to the quality restaurant they were five years ago."}
{"text":"The steak here is the best around. Stanley is known for the Woodshed and people come from all over to eat here, so you know its good! The salad bar is also a win. Garlic toast - delicious. The chocolate-chocolate cake is just like my great aunt made me for my birthday every year until she passed. You can tell someone makes it from scratch and when they're sold out, it's literally devastating."}
{"text":"THE best salad bar hands down! the beef tips are always my first choice, but the chopped steak is great too (don't forget to order the mushroom gravy)! the desserts are all homemade and wonderful!"}
{"text":"Sorry but the service we received tonight was the worst we've ever experienced anywhere.  Our waitress took our order brought our drinks and disapeared. Seriously disapeared, she left the resturant. The problem was, no one told us. After about 45 minutes we finally asked a second waitress to check on our meal and get the manager. The manager said our first waitress had got sick and left. She made excuses for not getting us a new waitress or even telling us that she left.  We got our meal a short time later and she said it \"just came up\". The frys were limp and the steak was luke warm.  Im convinced we would still be there if we had not asked someone.  We wont be back."}
{"text":"Over priced & not worth it. The salad bar was the best part about it. If you want a good steak for half the price go to Longhorn"}
