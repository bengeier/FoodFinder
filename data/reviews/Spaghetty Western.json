{"text":"Just leaving this lovely new spot next to our house, great food with a wonderful knowledgable staff on the menu items! The place itself is very small but makes you feel like your in your own home which adds to the experience, I highly recommend that you check it out!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch . Ordered a $15 chicken sandwich (too expensive by any standard ) Which came with option of soup or salad .  Chose the Pasta Fagioli soup . Was gross lacked any seasoning , and was too starchy with only a few small pieces of pasta . It more  resembled a white bean  soup . Not good had to send back after 1 bite . Chicken sand. Was just meh....  Dry sandwich with zero dressing / mayo or anything . Tomatoes were not fresh . Few small pieces of welted greens and again lacked any seasoning .  The person I came with ordered the lasagna which was burnt on the bottom .  This place used to be better . It pisses me off when restaurants just don't give a damn about taste and quality yet still want to charge double for a gross and disgusting sandwich. I will never return nor will I recommend to any1 with tastebuds . and I hope ur greedy asses go from Grand opening to Grand closing .... Get a new chef or start caring more ."}
{"text":"Good food and best friendly server Clemente!"}
{"text":"Still super friendly service and wonderful food.  Specials change daily with different soups, pasta offerings and sandwiches.  We have been at least every week or week and a half since opening and we love our Spaghetty Western.  Yes, it can get a little crowded at times but it is worth the wait.  I never have to worry about leftovers uneaten in the fridge.  Have ordered items for guests at a party and the reviews have been great.  I cook at home 98% of the time so it is nice to have a neighborhood restaurant that isn't a chain with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"We just came back from an Italian vacation.  The quality was that of a Trattoria in Italy.  The cooks are from Italy and made us dishes with homemade pasta.  Great pasta and desserts. Highly recommend if you are looking for high quality Italian."}
{"text":"Ehh... the food here isn't that great! I ordered the spaghetty western and the captain seafood linguini.  The sauce was ehh okay, nothing great.  The seafood wasn't hot enough so therefore tasted fishy and lack of flavor.  The garlic bread which came with the order was soggy and drenched in butter/margarine. Over $20 bucks per order is hefty for an order of pasta which wasn't that Good. I doubt I'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm always is search of good EATS, and I just so happened to find a little jewel close to home! The food here is super delicious and the service is amazing! I've been 3 times in the past 2 weeks, and every time I left with a smile on my face and a smiling belly."}
{"text":"We just discovered this Italian restaurant a bit pricey but worth it, the food is delicious, the service is excellent  The only draw back was the pizza size 12'' but that pizza was great I don't think you'll be disappointed  Lenny G"}
{"text":"They just recently expanded beautiful place, and now accommodates for dining in. Unfortunately, the food quality didn't stay the same. Great service. I wish the food stayed the same before the expansion. Unfortunately, won't be going back."}
{"text":"Unbelievably amazing dinner and I'm not normally a big fan of Italian food. Had caprese, wonderful quality mozzarella and balsamic, French onion soup, delicious, portobello mushroom ravioli, UNBELIEVABLE!! fresh made pasta!! And meatball sub, so good, tasty meatballs!! Desert was also fantastic. Looking forward to the next visit!"}
{"text":"This place serves up incredible food and the gentleman who always helps us is charming and knowledgeable...he knows quality and makes excellent recommendations."}
{"text":"Experiences at this place are always inconsistent. Ordered the shrimp scampi and was so disgusted, I sent it back and ordered nothing else, while waiting for my family to finish their meals. Tried to mix the noodles in sauce, of which, there was very little, but the sauce was flavorless, like water with salt and lemon juice. Very bad. Wait staff said the chef/cook tasted and confirmed, \"yep, no flavor\" and that the guy who made it was new. Please spend the extra $ to hire a \"real\" Chef who knows Italian cooking and until then, don't try to pass this place off as a fine dining experience. The \"owner\", who sat at the bar the whole time we were there drinking wine, sent the waiter over to offer us a free dessert, never once coming to our table to acknowledge my complaint. I watched as one of the waiters spoke to him while looking at us, expecting him to come over and meet with us, but no, he just sat there keeping that seat warm. News flash, if you own the place and care about the quality of the food and service in your establishment, you should be on your feet checking the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen and engaging your customers to make sure their experience is good. ESPECIALLY, when you know the quality of it is poor. You chose to acknowledge us in the parking lot as we were leaving at the same time commenting, \"hope you had a good meal\"....No, we didn't...and you know that, WTF??? This is how you engage? What a joke! Have you ever owned a restaurant before or did you just see the $$$$ signs and figured you'd give it a shot? The gentleman who owned this place before, and took his life savings to do it, was a humble man and really cared about what was being served to his customers. Back then, the food was authentic and good. His livelihood depended on it!! No complaints about our waiter."}
{"text":"The food here is made to order, nothing comes out of a jar. It's fresh, real ingredients and overall amazing food in a casual atmosphere. Highly recommend for a low key date night with some wonderful quality dishes!"}
{"text":"More of a take-out atmosphere. Good food. Second visit I ordered lasagna, salad, garlic bread take-out, called at 4:00, asked to pick it up at 6:00, had to put it in the oven for another 45 min, as it was ice-cold in the middle, scalding hot on the bottom. I called and they put me on hold forever, I gave up, hung up.  Will give it a 3rd try, probably just the pizza."}
{"text":"We order often togo but tonight we decided to dine in. We sat for 10 minutes and watched the wait staff to figure out who's table/ who was going to help us. The man who came over only offered sparkling or still water not thinking there was another option we ordered the still later to be charged $6 for water. He also tried to do the same thing after we ordered our meal with and appetizer but the way he presented it was like he's offering it to you not expecting to pay (like the water). From then on he was staring at us and continuously arguing with his co workers. We were already feeling uncomfortable. Then we got our calamari and it just didn't taste good so we didn't eat it, he then asked if we didn't like it and I was truthful and said no. He took it and said we will remove it from your check. He walked away and told the kitchen from the down stairs dining to the up stairs kitchen in from our the whole room we didn't like it. At this point I'm mortified and just want to leave. We got our pasta and it was great, the pasta there always is but unfortunately due to this horrible experience we won't even be ordering to go anymore. HUGE LET DOWN."}
{"text":"This place so authentic Italian, I feel like my grandmother is cooking in the kitchen.  We eat here regularly And send all our friends and family"}
{"text":"Delicious, used to have to drive all the way to Nora's on flamingo and jones for great Italian food, but now there is a wonderful local spot, don't get me wrong Nora's is great, but this is just a good if not better and a lot closer to my boyfriends house. Delicious."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Southern Highlands. Stopped by for lunch on a Monday and the quality of the food blew my mind. I got to enjoy lunch with the owner David, and at his recommendation, we ordered the Alex Chopped salad, Pasta a Fagiola soup, Baked Butternut Squash Ravioli and a pepperoni and olive pizza. Finished up with Tiramisu dessert. Amazing. Stella Artois draft beer was a nice touch! Don't let the name fool you. This is not Olive Garden or some other generic Italian restaurant. Take a look at the menu. Cacio e Pepe and butternut squash ravioli is not on every Italian menu, so I consider that a win. Also, this place is perfect for someone with a certain craving or medical condition (i.e. expectant mothers, foodies, food allergies, picky eaters, etc.) because they will adjust anything on the menu to your liking per the owner. That's great service!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Southern Highlands for the past 5 years. This place was a gem before, fresh family run business. I'm afraid my red line has finally been crossed with the new owners. Called $80 take out order at 3:00. Told me 15 minutes. I show up at 3:20. 1 other customer at bar. 3 people in the kitchen. They haven't started my order yet!!!  \"Don't worry it will only take 5 minutes\"  Are the new owners serious? I've spent so much money at this place over the years remaining patient. Never again. Not one more penny from me."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!!!!! I'm Italian and very very fussy about my pasta. The Penne Arrabiatta is fantastic! The gnocchi is also one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian places I've ever been to, this place can rival all of my favorite places in town. Pasquale is also extremely helpful and a pleasure to meet. I had half servings of the Lobster Ravioli and Pene Bobby. Also tried the chicken parm which was also to die for. I wouldn't mind trying everything on this menu."}
{"text":"We were going to have dinner at Metro Pizza but detoured over to Spaghetty Western.  Excellent decision!  Great atmosphere, friendly waitstaff, and yummy food.  We had garlic bread and fried mozzarella for appetizers.  Pizza, spinach tortellini soup, and lasagne bolognese for entrees.  Everything was great and the prices are very fair for the quality of food!!"}
{"text":"Another great evening at the Spaghetti Western!Our waiter Alex Nunes has served us many times and always makes it a lovely night.  My husband and I both decided to take Alex's recommendation and over a bottle of wine I had the pasta Cacio E Pepe with Cavatelli pasta and my husband had the Roasted Chicken with vegetables and wonderful mashed potatoes.  He also ordered his go to dessert- Tiramisu.  Lovely evening.  Thank you Alex."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you,this is good authentic Italian food.Some of the best you can find in a small local strip mall.  Decent portions,good selection gluten free options and flavorful sauces make it a great choice.I only get take out and have never dined in,happy every time I get it."}
{"text":"Very friendly and attentive service. Food was great but disappointed there was no ricotta cheese to add to a white pizza. Highly recommend for their other items. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Service was so good. My pasta was off the hook. I got the Speck with Linguine. The sauce was delicious too. My kids loved the meatballs.  I love to home sweet home vibe! Love love love."}
{"text":"Io e mio marito, grazie al proprietario, Andrea, che è italiano, ci siamo sentiti curati e coccolati!! Gli ingredienti sono freschi, di qualità e very made in Italy!!! Se passate per Las Vegas dovete provare  Spaghetty Western!!!"}
{"text":"Best real Italian food in all of las vegas. Highly recommended and newly renovated so there is room for the whole family. Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"as good as it gets.....this is one fine dining experience (sans ambience)....do yourself a favor when eating in LV....if you like Italian, you will love this place"}
{"text":"Service has much improved since my last visit! Still took a long while to get entrees but no problems ordering what I desired. Would have given 5 stars but I ordered the caesar salad and though it was fairly sub par."}
{"text":"Food was great honestly had low expectations at first but man was I blown away for deliver Italian it was pretty authentic and the spaghetti and meatballs has an amazing flavor!!!!"}
{"text":"When your plates empty and your beyond full and still want more.... you know you had some good eats... will be back again and again and again and again..."}
{"text":"Best meal I had since I moved to Las Vegas! !!!!! Fresh, and delicious ...friendly staff, and cozy place to dine in. Their fried calamari was exquisite, as well as the Risotto pescatore."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this place and it certainly won't be the last!  We don't reside in Southern Highlands, but in SW Vegas, but I would certainly drive across town for a meal here.  The restaurant is small and casual, but the food was honestly some of the best we've had anywhere, especially in Vegas where Italian isn't on par with what my fiance and I grew up eating back home.  Every part of the meal was outstanding.  I had one of the daily specials, gnocchi with marinara, mozzarella, and basil, and he had the fettuccine alfredo with chicken.  Both meals came with garlic bread, which was also divine. I ordered a dinner salad as well and it was perfect.  The whole meal with a bottle of wine was $52 before tip.  I would pay double for the quality of the meal.  If you are looking for a sit-down restaurant, this isn't really it, but if you want quality recipes for a reasonable price, you've found what you're looking for!"}
{"text":"We live in Southern Highlands and frequent this restaurant. It is always delicious! From the Pasta Diablo to Spaghetti and meatballs, everything we have had is fantastic. Their pizza is so good. On the menu it says it is a personal pizza but it is actually a small and enough for 2 people to share. It is always very busy in the evenings especially the weekends. They are expanding, thank goodness, and that tells you how well they are doing. Go, sit, enjoy a glass of wine and some great food and company...now that's Italian!"}
{"text":"Linguine and clams is good, better  than Oyster Bar. My husband's order kinda ruined, he ordered, Rib Eye Steak with veggies but when he asked for steak sauce, they don't have it. You don't serve Steak without  steak sauce, especially when it really needed."}
{"text":"I love this place. The pasta speck is my favorite. Their new white chocolate profiteroles are great. They are fast and deliver in Mountains Edge. We order from them about once a month. We have never eaten in the restaurant and can only attest go the awesome food and homemade deserts."}
{"text":"Yum!  This place is always packed but the food is stellar and the service is great.  I highly recommend trying one of their fresh pastas.  Also they deliver so that's super."}
{"text":"I was happy to see a new place open near my neck of the woods and took the opportunity to get a bite with some friends.  The service was warm and friendly and the food was quick.  The young lady made some good recommendations with our antiposto platter which was huge. My chicken Marsala was large and tasty.  The only thing I would gripe about is the small seating area but it is understandable as I saw a ton of take out orders while we were the only ones seated there.  Just a casual place with some solid food."}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian food. Fresh, high quality stuff and good portions. We ordered Cheese Ravioli with meat sauce, Gnocchi nini and Chicken piccata. Everything was amazing, juicy and flavorful. Food is also priced rite for this quality and portions..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an early dinner.  Service was good, food yummy.  Quick ticket time, nice wine selection.  Happy to see them doing well."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and when I got home my wife's Gnocchi and bread was cold. Also,she did not receive her breaded zucchini. I called them back and had to wait 25 minutes for the breaded zucchini when I was told 5 minutes. By the time I got home I did not feel like eating my $55 take out dinner. My wife was pissed and now I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is a place to frequent often. The food is incredible. It is authentic Italian fresh made and it shows. You will not be disappointed. We tried 5 different dishes and every one was delicious. The shrimp scampi was the favorite dish of the table and the Mac and cheese was kid (and adult) approved!"}
{"text":"It's too bad how this restaurant has gone downhill so quickly. Our first experience several months ago was excellent, from both service and food quality perspectives. Our last two visits we found our servers to be unfriendly and unmotivated. The food was slow coming from the kitchen and not nearly the quality we remembered. The restaurant was not full on our last Saturday night visit. We are not surprised."}
{"text":"A quaint little hole-in-the-wall deli/restaurant.  The menu is way larger than the seating area, but it's a great lunch/dinner spot if you don't need a lot of elbow room.  They DO offer gluten free pasta even though it's not on the menu, and their meatballs are also made without bread crumbs last time I checked."}
{"text":"Great Mom and Pop Italian joint in Vegas. Marinara sauce and gnocchi is on point! Staff is amazing and friendly. The owners are very pleasant and pro-military. Very fast, delicious and an amazing asset to the Southern Highlands  community.   They are getting ready to expand to accommodate the dine in customers. Place looks great after small remodel and tables added inside."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with the kids, 5 people total and it was ok. We ordered calamari for appetizers and it was really rubbery. Would not recommend. Everyone ordered chicken parmesan and the chicken was huge. Took some leftover home. Service was decent. Took awhile for the check to come but no big deal. Would co me back to try something different. Kid and family friendly."}
{"text":"The tiramisu is truly amazing. I love their shrimp Alfredo as well! Every time I order in or out I have never had anything to complain about.  :)"}
{"text":"Worst meal ever. Ordered a lasagna, a angus burger in chiabatta bread.   After waiting waiting for 45 minutes while all the to go orders were taken care off before my meal, We finally got our meal.  My lasagna was COOL, parts were even a little frozen, unbelievable !!!!   They were out if chiabatta bread and served the frozen patty hamburger on a hoagie bum.  Do not eat here if you are expecting fresh, recently made food. !!"}
{"text":"Best pesto I've eaten! and the staff is all so friendly it feels like a family restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I love to come here. We just moved near by the restaurant from California. We had an Italian restaurant back in Cal we'd always go to and worried we'd never find one like it. Well, we did and love the food, as much as the staff at Spaghetty Western! Trying all the dishes on the menu and so far, all have been great! I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a cozy setting, exceptional barkeeps, awesome service and super great Italian food; definitely come here. 3 large screens at the bar section with sports on also allows for cold beers and drinks and not missing a thing..."}
{"text":"in terms of the food, they really have good pasta, good pizza, and really good tiramisu. We still need to taste a lot. We keep on ranking them but it really is hard to choose which one we like best.  Ate last Saturday mar.11 with the whole family. It was my hubby's first time so i ordered the speck pasta. After ordering it, our server asked him soup or salad and my hubby chose soup. Our serverr replied with a name of a soup and we thought maybe that was the soup of the day. My children were surprised  the pasta cane with soup or salad. The server didn't ask would you want soup or salad, he came off like my husband should choose one or the other. Well, the mystery was solved when we saw an extra $7.95 on our bill. Aside from that, my daughter asked him to add chicken to her pasta, well he added shrimp which costs more. Is he trying to pull a fast one on all his customers? We had him change it but i am sure they just took out the shrimp and replaced it with chicken because it didn' t take long to replace. Good thing my daughter has no allergy to shrimp!. First time around everything was good. I will still go back but i will make sure he is not our server! I will never forget his face.  The other server who was giving water deservd the tip we left."}
{"text":"Average prices. Great environment. Food is average."}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food. Although short handed on Saturday afternoon, the Rep was friendly, speedy and ensure us great service."}
{"text":"The BEST Homemade Italian food in town!!! The sauce is amazing all homemade pastas. Caperese Salad is amazing and big enough for 3 people. If you want a outstanding burger you have to also order that one the menu!! We are now heading there anytime we want Italian.. from now on!!!  Only thing I would change is the tables and seats.  They are not the most comfortable to sit at."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Best Italian food I've ever had besides the east coast! Owner is awesome and is extremely friendly and approachable!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff!! Great wine list. Our Server Milan was great and very pleasant! I will come back!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since it opened, when all of the cold cuts and cheeses were imported from Italy.   Back then, the cold cut and cheese platter was large and the most delicious I have ever had.  Now, the portions are smaller, the cold cuts lack flavor and the cheeses seem like they just go down to Smiths grocery and pick up some very cheap cuts.  Ordered the Spaghetty Western and carbonara and the noodles, which were once freshly made and al dente, now seem like they come from a box and over cooked.  The prosciutto used is dry, chewy and lacks a lot of flavor.  Too bad the old owner, Andrea left, truly was a hidden gem.  He has a new place in summerlin, if anyone knows please let me know where it is!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, creative drinks, and friendly staff! Try the lavender margarita! It's amazing ! Food specials are equally as good and are always changing. If I'm feeling indecisive though - the Eggplant Parmesan is my go-to! Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"By far the only true Italian food in Las Vegas.  This place beats any high end Italian restaurant on the STRIP. I'm born in raised in Manhattan and this is as good as it gets"}
{"text":"This is my go too place for Italian food for take out. My favorite so far is the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and I like to add mushrooms, which they are more than welcome to accommodate. You can see everything is made to order and usually co Es with a piece of garlic bread, really good when eaten fresh. I also like there freshly made tiramisu...so yummy. This place has a small deli selection which I believe are meats from Italy. Definitely plan on trying other items on the menu, oh I also like their caprese salad when I'm in the mood. Definitely check this place out, it's hard to find authentic restaurants, that are delicious!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now.   The first time I dined there and had a Caesar salad and the lobster ravioli. Caesar was nothing special but the ravioli was great. Service was prompt and friendly. I would give that visit 4 stars.   Today we ordered takeout. I ordered:  The Northern caprese  Caesar salad Meatball appetizer Calabrese sandwich  Manicotti  A lot of food- and for $63 including delivery fee/tax, I would expect it to be delicious... but it really fell short this time.   The tomatoes on the caprese disappointed me most. So far from ripe the middles were completely white. If that's all you have, I think the item should be removed from the menu until you have better produce. You can't have a caprese with bad tomatoes.   Caesar was same... But lettuce was a little wilted here and there.   The garlic bread was super dry and even stale tasting. Maybe because of the delivery time.   My boyfriend said the meatballs were \"meh,\" and the calabrese got a thumbs down.   My manicotti was fine. Not bad. Not good. Honestly I like the premade ones at trader joes better.   This delivery I would give 2 stars. I've averaged out my 2 visits to the 3. My boyfriend says I'm being generous and is trying to make me go someplace else for a lunch re-do."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is the definition of not messing around. The lasagna is amazing and the portions are out of control. The salads are huge and beautifully fresh. The attention to detail is definitely something that is a priority for the chefs. Friendly and helpful staff as well."}
{"text":"Soft opening night!! Good times good people.... Cheese and Wine... Pasta 4 cheeses amazing!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.   Antipasti, meatballs, spaghetti and the best cannoli ever!  The food and the service are really great."}
{"text":"RUN AWAY!  The older cook stuck his finger in his mouth 2 clear sum food caught in his teeth then stuck his hand in the pasta reservoir to put on someone's plate.    We only came here cuz of the overflow @ Off The Strip.  Servers/cooks may have been overwhelmed cuz of the heavy business.    Plus female server had a martyr complex: \"I'm the only one doing stuff.\", \"The owner makes things too chaotic\", etc."}
{"text":"Tried dining in after the remodel and we loved it.  Everything from the drinks,  the pasta,  and even the garlic bread was delicious.  I think we food our southern highlands Italian spot."}
{"text":"Some of the most authentic best tasting Italian I've had in awhile. The owner is very Italian and was very inviting when we arrived. If you're in the mood for Italian this is 100% your best choice."}
{"text":"Very tasty food. Owner is Italiano & she has a great sense of humor. The food was outstanding. My first visit and I was completely impressed. Mangia Mangia"}
{"text":"Yum. Was craving a good authentic Italian style deli sandwich and the mozzarella prosciutto did not disappoint. After a long morning of furniture shopping sharing a sandwich was not going to cut it for myself and the hubby so we also split an order of meatballs and the Caesar salad... All delicious. We will def be back and are looking forward to checking things out after the expansion."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to check out this place for quite some time and was able to do so today. Was a little taken back how small the dining area was. Not that it was a bad thing, just wasn't expecting such a small space. Happen to go when they weren't so busy but not sure how they accommodate larger crowds during busier hours. Due to the space limitations, I imagine most people call in their orders and do take out. Anyhoo, I'm constantly searching around for the best Italian food and this place was not bad. Wouldn't say it would land the title as my \"fav\" however, I enjoyed my meal. We ordered the Chicken Parmigiana sub, Cheese Pizza, and half order of Chicken Alfredo pasta. Must say I have had better tasting alfredo sauce, however it was not bad. I really liked the sauce on the sub, had a sweetness to it that I enjoyed. And the cheese pizza was yummy too but they maybe used a little too much of the flour on the bottom of the pizza as it was everywhere. But that tiny little gripe didn't ruin the taste. So in all, not a bad little Italian spot. I'll be back to try out some other dishes from here!"}
{"text":"We ordered for pick up and when my girlfriend arrived they had a gentlemen working the front and he seemed confused. She waited 20 minutes after when they told us the food would be ready.  Then he \"found\" the food and called her over. She had seen the bag on the counter the whole time.  She asked about it and he lied and said it just got finished. The food was all cold and soggy. Sad that their lackadaisical attitude ruined our dinner.  We won't be back"}
{"text":"Just renovated and it looks so good! I've been there a couple of times and the food is always great and servers are very friendly. The desserts I've come to find out are a bit of hit and miss. My first time there I absolutely loved the tiramisu as they had used mascarpone cheese, like its supposed to be. Second time around ordering it, it was mostly cream cheese with a minute hint of mascarpone. I cried a little. On the plus side they're also on GrubHub so I get to have the delicious pastas delivered."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great food and great service :-) this Italian girl approves! Try the gnocchi in vodka sauce, or the fried calamari when it is on special. The waitress is very knowledgable about what sauce goes best with which pasta (ravioli, gnocchi, tortellini, etc) and she can tell you the ingredients without having to ask. The service is prompt, and the food comes out very quickly, which is rare for Italian! I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone that is looking for some fresh Italian."}
{"text":"My first review ever because that's how impressed I am.  We ordered chicken parmigiana, melted in your mouth juiciness with a lite crispiness.  Also ordered the special, which was Italian meatloaf.  Omgosh the flavor was divine; the sauce on the meatloaf had a fresh tomato sweetness.  We topped it with dessert.  The semifreddo was excellent.  First time I've had it, was smooth and creamy.  We spoke with owner, the desserts are made fresh daily.  We will be back!! Gloria, Juan and kids."}
{"text":"Their antipasto is amazing. We've tried a few things and all delicious. The staff is a little unprofessional but it doesn't really bother me. A must try."}
{"text":"I'm born and raised in New York City,  this is by far the only true Italian restaurant in Vegas. Any negative comments are from people who don't have clue what real Italian food is."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Italian food, excellent and expedient service, and friendly staff.   Enjoyed a lunch with my family. I got the sausage and peppers sandwich which was delicious.   I plan to visit again, for sure."}
{"text":"I eat here once a week. The atmosphere is great, the servers and chef are very pleasant. I'm a huge fan of the chicken parm. It's delicious. I will say this, if your coming for lunch make sure you have the time if your dinning in. This food is prepared individually so to get the good food, it takes the time. Lunch is 45 minutes if the restaurant is 1/2 full. But it is definitely worth the wait. It's also large portions so be ready to have some discipline as it's very tough to stop once you've started."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant  we will not visit again.  We visited for the first time with another couple. We were seated and our server offered beverage service.  We were told it was happy hour so I ordered a Wastach IPA on tap.  The server did not mention the price.  We ordered our meals and requested separate checks.  My wife and I ordered and split an Alex  salad which was good.   We asked if bread was served, assuming it was complimentary.  A small portion of garlic bread was served.  We enjoyed but felt the serving was small so we requested more.   I ordered a second IPA.  I ordered  the Cavatelli Rustica and liked it.  My wife had the Baked Mostaccoioli and thought it very dry.  Portions of each were more than ample.  One order for the other couple (butternut squash ravioli was returned.  By the time the replacement order was served, the rest of us had almost finished our meals.    When we got our checks, we were unpleasantly surprised.  Our total with tax came to $72.85.  The IPA's were $8.00 each.  I am not a beer expert but checked at the local store which sells Wasatch for $8.99 per six-pack.  I thought the $8.00  was excessive for a 12  oz. happy hour offering.  We were all not pleased when we learned the Fettunta or garlic bread was not complimentary and was priced at $3.95.  Not being pleased by the lack of information from our server we added a $10 tip and paid with our debit card.  Our biggest surprise came when we reviewed our  bank statement and found we had been charged an extra $72.85!   The charge to our account totaled $155.70.  This is not a place we will visit again.  Above charge is now being disputed!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place waiter was more involved in watching the tv then servicing his customers. Food was bland and not fresh. For what they charge a bread basket would be appropriate. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Was really craving a good solid Italian deli sandwich and I got just that here. I live in Southern California and there's a very highly regarded place called bay cities deli that is killer and j would say this place was just as good if not maybe even better. Great selection of meats and cheeses and toppings made creating a special order custom sandwich a real treat. Will definitely be coming back here before I head home."}
{"text":"Our go to place for a good salad and the best spaghetti and meatballs in town !! My once a week treat is dinner from here ."}
{"text":"The food here does not disappoint.   The service is often disorganized and far from on-point.   Last time we were here we got a pound of Speck to take home.  Mmmm.  Worth checking out,  from this point forward I think I will do take-out orders."}
{"text":"After 2 years searching, finally found a fantastic Italian restaurant!!  Food is EXCELLENT, service couldn't be better!  Deserts made fresh daily! Can't wait for our next visit!  HUGE fans!"}
{"text":"We've been to this place twice and both times we though the food tasted excellent and we like the small atmosphere.  The 2nd time my wife ordered the linguini with clams and mussels.  This was the only thing she ate all day.  About an hour and a half later her stomach was in so much pain.  After trying to tough it out all night she wound up in the E.R. at 3 am with food poisoning and has been laid up in bed for 3 days already and I've had to call out of work for 3 days to care for our baby since she can't.  I personally like the place but i'd probably avoid the seafood at all costs and sad to say that I probably will never go back, overall with lost wages and E.R. bills an inexpensive meal came out to be a really expensive one.  Disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"This small family run restaurant is such a welcome addition to southern highlands which is so lacking in good eats. If you are looking for authentic Italian meats and cheeses you need to try this! I have not eaten in yet but have done takeout many times and delivery also. (They always say 30 to 45 mins and are here in about 15!) so far I've tried the cioppino ( my fav dish) it's excellent with lots of fresh shellfish, shrimp, crab legs and fish. The 12 dollar antipasto misto is awesome! You can pick 3 meats and 2 cheeses or let the chef put it together. It comes with olives, sundries tomatoes, artichokes, roasted peppers and some greens ..( ask for some of their amazing balsamic glaze on the side. ) iced tried several different pastas with meatballs and meat sauce too. Pastas were cooked perfectly al dente and reheated well too.  Meatballs were perfect texture and flavourful. I also love their caprese salad. The fresh mozzarella is some of the best I've had! They also have my fav dessert ever which is tiramisu and theirs is awesome great cocoa and coffee flavors and so light and creamy. I would rate this a solid 4/12 stats but they need a few improvements.. The seats in the restaurant are very uncomfortable even for the short time while I waited for my takeout. Plus they could improve their takeout containers .. The boxes are okay for drier items but for my cioppino it seeps through a little and I live less than 5 mins away. All in all please try this place and support our local family run restaurants!"}
{"text":"I really love this place! I've been there few times and the pasta and everything is very original Italian that I really appreciate, the service is nice. I thing the only place of improvement is on the dessert menu! Everything else super enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I work In the shopping center so I'm here almost everyday for lunch. Everything on the menu is delish"}
{"text":"Awesome Italian food in a great neighborhood. I get the penne with the pink vodka sauce, and meatballs almost every time. The antipasto salad and the caprese are both incredible too. Give these guys a chance!!!"}
{"text":"So far I have had a couple experiences at this restaurant, I have ordered the caprese salad and garlic bread to take to a party and the owner was very helpful and accommodating with serving suggestions. My next experience was dining in and once again the owner was very accommodating, one item we ordered was the antipasto, my daughter loves cheese and he no problem with adding extra and I thought that was great. I gave this place 2 stars because as I read many other reviews, I agree with other comments I to had to deal with whomever the unpleasant blonde server/cashier is as well as witnessed some unprofessional behavior behind the counter. Anyone behind that counter should be required to have there hair tied back and it should be common knowledge never to pull out money in front of guest. I really hope they can make the whatever changes needed because I really think they have good food."}
{"text":"Nice decor. They expanded and remodeled about 2 years ago. We've been here multiple times and always liked the food and service, until this last visit. The service was good, but the waitress didn't bring one of the appetizers we ordered and forgot to place my order until everyone else was served. Okay, everybody makes mistakes. The antipasto platter was very disappointing as an appetizer,  kind of like low cost store bought deli meats.   We've always enjoyed the lobster ravioli, but for some reason they started.putting bay shrimp in the pink sauce. Yes, they might be canned. The rest was okay, but the food seems to have slipped in quality. I don't know wgat happened, but we won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Food has definitely gotten better. Maybe the new owner is the reason. No more burnt free garlic bread. You have to pay for it now and it's better. Sauce isn't as salty so they must have changed the recipe. I'm glad the food has gotten better here and I can add it back into a go to place for Italian food."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night this place was amazing good service ,fast , friendly , very enjoyable dinner can't wait to go back and take the whole family we loved everything."}
{"text":"We were seated right away. Server described the specials. Salad, soup and entree were excellent. We took our dessert to go. I must say very tasty!  We are here visiting our daughter and gave the neighborhood restaurant a try. Didn't know what to expect with a name like spaghetty western. Had great service and a good time.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. I'm half-Italian and very picky about my Italian food. This place is great! They've had some growing/expansion pains the last couple of months, and I suspect that's why some of the negative reviews. But they're back to business as usual, and I haven't had any issues with food or service since they reopened. My favorite is the Bobbi (just ask to add chicken or otherwise customize your dish they will try hard to please you) or the Pasta Speck, which is not on the current menu, but will hopefully be back (again, just ask, and they'll make it for you). Best tiramisu I've ever had. Say hi to David; he'll make you feel welcome and treat you like family."}
{"text":"Spaghetty Western has delicious Italian food. I've dined there 3 times & have been happy every time. I love their gnocchi with vodka sauce & their chicken parm is delish as well! Their house & caprese salads are both great!  They have a nice wine selection & gelato for dessert. I will dine there again & would recommend them for a casual dining experience if you appreciate fresh ingredients & authentic Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! Fresh pasta daily, tortellini soup was light and flavored perfectly. Caprese salad was the best I've ever had! We also had the Diablo pasta which had just enough spice to give it a kick but not be overly hot. Great laid back, family atmosphere. Will definitely be coming back here again and again!"}
{"text":"Great local place for dinner good clams pasta and great specials got to love it will be eating more often highly recommended"}
{"text":"Good value of pasta. BOBBI is my hub's favorite. I tried a Spagetty Western, Alfredo, Meatball, Scampi, etc... Everything was good to try. It took a lit bit of time when is on weekends, but service won't let you down."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! Very rude and screwed up my order. I came in for spaghetti and meatballs. They have me linguini instead. I ordered to go and got to my house and opened up my food and it was wrong. This place sucks don't go there or order from there ."}
{"text":"The fresh authentic Italian ingredients transformed the traditional dishes into a Party in my Mouth!!! We are a family of 4 and each separate dish was the best Italian meals we've had. The Hostess recommendation and service was perfect.."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The Butternut Squash Ravioli is AMAZING!  Always good food no matter what you are eating!"}
{"text":"I've been coming her since they opened. 6 times in total I've eaten here and each time I come I swear to myself I'll never return. The food is great, even though I've seen the old Italian chef mishandle chicken. He handled raw breasts with no gloves then touched pot handles and bread. A severe health code violation. Anyway...they are 6/6 for getting my order wrong....totally wrong. If it's not the people at the counter writing it down incorrectly, it's being made wrong or even me being charged incorrectly."}
{"text":"My first time here. Awesome place. David makes you feel welcome. Had the Grilled Octopus Salad, special Bruschetta, Chicken Marsala. Finished up with fresh hand made Cannoli and Tiramisu with Fresh strawberries."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced and not very good. Atmosphere is cafeteria like.  The salad and wine were down right horrible. The garlic bread was bland and tasteless. The waitstaff was rude and unfriendly. The cook was chewing gum while cooking and prepping food. We will never go here again.   On a positive note, the food was served quickly."}
{"text":"My first time here and very impressed with their service and food! I ordered the chicken marsala and the chicken was very tender and juicy. The sauce was also really good. I finished my whole plate and it was a really good serving size. For dessert, I had the \"lemon.\" Definitely try it out! I highly recommend this place, I will come back and try their whole menu."}
{"text":"Wow this place it's amazing food is great very quick service ...nice little hidden gem of Italian would recommend to all my friends..."}
{"text":"Food is good but portion size does not match the price. Service at the counter is slow and sometimes can get unorganized. I will say flavor is good but the amount you get for what you pay is lacking."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service I've ever had in the Vegas valley. We sat outside because the only table available inside was reserved. Our waitress came to take our order. We ordered appetizers, our entrees and said we'd probably get dessert. After she brought our drinks we never saw her again. This is a place that's slogan is \"authentic Italian really fast\". There was nothing fast about this place. 30 minutes later waiting outside our main entrees arrived...no silverware, no drink refills and most importantly no appetizer. At this point the service, if you can call it that, is a complete joke. I went inside to ask for silverware as well as to cancel our appetizer order since we already had our main course. The other table outside waited even longer but they were patient since they said they knew one of the owners...someone supposedly named Terry. The only reason they get one star is because the food was actually quite good...& Yelp doesn't let you give zero stars. Will we ever come back? Probably not and its because of the horrible service. Which is sad since the food was actually quite good."}
{"text":"I'm having withdrawals because I haven't been here in over a week... The food is outstanding, the ambiance is great, and the people that work here are even better!  To top it all off, they have a killer happy hour that is one of the best deals in Las Vegas!  I love this place, my girlfriend loves this place, and everybody we have brought loves this place!"}
{"text":"Nice little place near mountains edge.  Anti pasta was awesome.  Pasta was good.  Great service and the deserts were very good.  Loved the octopus appetizer and it's a must order.  The balsamic glaze they have is awesome and they gave us a bottle for 5 bucks which was very nice of them.  We will be back for lunch again soon."}
{"text":"Don't bother! Food was comparable to Olive Garden at best. But worse than that, the service! We came in around noon, the only people there when we arrived. The waitress was incredibly rude. When asking for a recommendation she was very short and not the least bit helpful. The quality of the food could have been overlooked but the atrocious service can not. Will not return and won't recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I'm just have to say that it is not the food but the overall experience I was given that disappointed me. I tried to order to pick up for 30 minutes with their phone going to voicemail or a busy tone. We decided to just go and order there. The kid they have working the register is really a poor choice in hiring. His angst and poor disposition really isn't what I would want for my customers first interaction at my restaurant. He asked if we had a pick up to which we replied no. He looked annoyed, started looking at all the tickets and says \"well it's going to be like a 25 minute wait\". I informed him of my trying to call and how I would have loved to have had a pick up but no one literally picked up the phone. He sighed and going \"it's been super busy in here.\" There were two tables with customers in the restaurant and 2 people waiting for their own take out orders. We still ordered but had to endure a bunch of passive aggressive looks and watched the cashier give each customer after us the same amount of sass. The food was definitely good but until the service improves its not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Support this restaurant! We don't have many good restaurants in Southern Highlands and this place is amazing. After living in Brooklyn for 3 years, I was looking for an Italian deli like the ones there and this place exceeded that.     I've had the spaghetty western, arrabbiata, chicken parm focaccia, and took home fresh mozzarella & prosciutto. Everything was delicious and better than most of the places I had in NYC."}
{"text":"Ahfreakingmazing.  Butternut squash ravioli is one of the best things I've ever had in mah mouth! And it was even better when I had the leftovers for breakfast! Chicken parm was perfection!  Restaurant is charming and rustic feeling and makes you forget you are in a strip mall. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Not only was the food phenomenal but the staff was awesome. Thanks Alex!"}
{"text":"I dined at Spaghetty Western with a friend and my girlfriend last week. To be honest, our service wasn't great that night - but the owner talked with us and made things right. David cares deeply for the restaurant and their customers and I really respect that. Additionally, the food and ambience were both on the higher end. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night to check out the new neighborhood eats.  Before going in, we totally expected this to be a very American spaghetti spot that the kids would love and were hoping for a free pass on cooking dinner once a month.  Sufficed to say, this isn't that place.  Not that the little ones didn't enjoy the spaghetti and meatballs, but the food quality is nothing like what you'd get at the major US chains.  This place is authentic and delicious!  The adults ordered fish entrees; Salmon Pink Vodka Linguini and Cod Fra Diavolo.  I'll start by saying, the fish in both dishes was amazing!  The salmon was moist and firm and the vodka sauce was creamy and delicious.  The cod in my dish was perfectly cooked!  Light and flaky in a very rich spicy diavolo sauce.  Not as spicy as some I've had, but very garlicy and rich!  The portion sizes are huge, as would be expected at any real Italian establishment.  Our waitress brought the dishes out, and immediately brought to-go containers and set them on the side for us.  I'm no quitter, so I finished my plate and went into pasta coma later on the sofa, but the other 2 dishes were barely noticeably dented before packing up for leftovers tonight (yay...no cooking 2 nights in a row!).   One of the most impressive things we notice and loved is that every order that is placed gets personally prepared in view of the customers.  We watched as the ladies behind the counter carefully prepared each dish and served them up.  No mass production here!  If there was any criticism at all, I have to say that the patio furniture type chairs were somewhat uncomfortable.  When eating pasta, I tend to almost stick my face in the dish to mitigate twirling pasta sauce projectiles from reaching my shirt, which is almost inevitable. We also considered hosting a kids b-day part here, but the tiny quaint space is pretty limited.  Very intimate for small groups and conversation.  Maybe more suited for a date night with a couple glasses of wine.  Overall a nice place and delicious food!  Definitely will be back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Just my three year old and me today. Place is small so looks busy. Waiter brought water to me 15 min after we sat down. We waited another 20 min before I made a hand gesture to waive them back, one of the staff saw and knotted. We were right by the door and watched two tables got their water fast then ordered before us, wow! Attempted to waive them down again nothing. yes, they were busy but they only had maybe six tables in the whole place. Maybe because I had gym clothes on and we were not dressed to the fives like the other patrons but damn! I was really looking forward to trying their food again but I guess they didn't feel like serving us today. This place must be making too much money so they can pick and choose their customers now. Hit or miss so good luck with this place and enjoy the wait time.   P.S don't come hungry !"}
{"text":"I came in and talked to the owner a bit before ordering food. He suggested the special which was on point. Afterwards, him and I talked some more and he told me he initially tried to cook authentic Italian food but people didn't like it so he switched his recipes to resemble something in-between American Italian and authentic Italian. His special he cooked more like authentic Italian which was why he suggested it to me. Yeah, spot on. American Italian is terrible. Terrible. It's so hard to find an authentic Italian restaurant in the States so when you do, you should definitely order that all the time over the American, and if you prefer the American Italian style, you need to really work on your taste buds because authentic Italian food is awesome. So I got a long really well with the owner and when you come in to order, tell him to cook it authentic Italian."}
{"text":"Daaaannngggg! While traveling with family and friends we were looking for a quick place to eat. So I turned to Yelp.  As a Sergio Leone fan I was intrigued by the name. Upon arriving at this quaint spot I was excited to see a deli case full of cheese. The staff were extremely courteous and passionate about their restaurant and food from the second we walked in.  I was sold on the veggie lasagne and the two dudes I was with opted for the Cioppino Royal.  All of it was amazing! The preparation was beautiful and the flavor was outstanding. The proprietors obviously value quality and their customers. One of the best random Yelp stops I've made."}
{"text":"Great local spot. Looks nice after the expansion and now they have a full bar.   The chicken Parmesean was great.   Save room for the Tiarimsu. Finish with some authentic Italian espresso.   This is a great local spot. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"All of the food here is delicious. However, what keeps me coming back is their desserts and their employee Johnnie. The desserts never ever disappoint. Johnnie is on it! We never wait, she multi tasks and is so nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I have to admit this place has exploded in size since the last time I was here. The service and food was amazing (I recommend the the chili spaghetti) 10/10. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lazy quick review:  A new go-to local Italian spot besides Nora's!  Awesome, quaint, little spot with cheeky spaghetti western deco!  Bobbi (add grilled chicken) = 10/10 super delicious! Would be a 9 without the chicken.   Carbonara = 9/10 I love a good carbonara and this place doesn't disappoint! Took off a point cause sometimes the onions don't cook down enough and some bites are too \"onion-y\"  Veal parmigiana = 9/10 large portion and not too greasy. Crust is nice and crispy, red sauce on spaghettii is flavorful!  Service is good, Alex served us a few times now and is always friendly. Sometimes we have to ask for the bread though, no biggie...  Nora's is slightly better albeit more expensive so that makes sense..."}
{"text":"Wow! What great Italian food! The only downside is the dining area needs to be larger so the tables can be larger to fit all the yummy food! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food... That OSSO BUCCO was one hell of a meal... It's a special but if they have it ...it's a must!!"}
{"text":"\"real authentic italian spot\" fire!!!! For being an off the strip place this is one of the best Italian spots around... 916mobn...."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this restaurant at all.  Ordered chicken fettucine Alfredo.   Tasted like something I would make at home...like it was out of a box.  Fortunately with a lot of extra Parmesan cheese it was edible.  Their menu boasted they they were better than other \"chain\" Italian restaurants...however this place made Olive Garden look like a five Michelin star restaurant.  First and last visit.  Went to McDonalds afterward."}
{"text":"The Pasta Diablo is always amazing along with the customer service. The food is very high quality, so the price is worth it. They made a small mistake on my previous order and were very polite and quick to make it right, which is all I can ask of any restaurant.   My exact order is the Pasta Diablo with penne and marinara sauce to go. Great portion, nice and spicy, and awesome flavor."}
{"text":"By far, the best chicken parmigiana my husband and I have had in Las Vegas. We asked Chef Jason to make it a little crispy, and he did just that. We also had the meatball appetizer that was so tasty. We love that this is a family owned business, and have gotten to know the owners. We are warmly welcomed every returned visit. Last visit I had the Osso Buco special with homemade pasta, 3 good size pieces tasted like it was cooking for hours, tender and very tasty."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I grew up outside of Manhattan with lots of access to authentic Italian food and this does not disappoint.  The deli is a major plus too!"}
{"text":"Close you eyes....well maybe that would not be a good idea since you need them open to read my review..lol. So imagine your eyes are closed, now imagine you are in Italy and your walking down the brick walk ways and your hungry so you dip into a little eatery for a bite to eat. You step into Spaghetty Western and you see a deli counter with different meats cured as Italian's do and cheeses, wines and deserts, you seat yourself at a little cafe style table, the waitress comes over and welcomes you and takes your drink order, her accent is strong and you listen carefully to make sure you hear her right. She brings back your drink orders and you order your meal, chicken parm and spaghetti and meatballs.(make sure to get an extra order of garlic bread you wont be disappointed). You smell the aroma of your food being prepared and you know this is no processed type Italian food, its pure authentic family recipe Italian food. The food comes out and looks amazing! The food is full of flavor, the red sauce tastes like they just made it that day, the noodles al dente! the motzerella cheese is to die for!! the flavor and the pull of the cheese when you eat it is sport on! The waitress comes and checks on us through out the meal. She brings boxes at the end because the portions are enough for 2 people. She tells us when we are ready to pay to meet her at the counter. Ok now open your eyes again.... you just had an Authentic Italian meal in Las Vegas...lol The food here is amazing feels like when you step in the door you go through a portal to Italy. From the look of the restaurant, to the Italian server, to the authentic food. They have a wide variety on their menu, they offer delivery if you are in their coverage area, and take out as well. The place is small but cozy and very clean, the bathrooms was spotless which is nice, there is nothing worse than a great meal and then going into a dirty bathroom. If you love italinan food you really have to give this place a try and your welcome for taking you on a trip to italy in the middle of the day...lol"}
{"text":"First timer here and I'm definitely coming back! Though it's a pretty small venue (estimating 50-60 people max?) The food, service, and ambience were all on point. At first the menu looked a bit confusing but after letting the server know it was our first time he explained everything we needed to know.   We started with the calamari which was delicious. Not so much breading and the flavor was a bit on the salted side and just enough that it kept me wanting more like a bag of chips.   We ended up ordering Alfredo pasta with Fettuccini and chicken and the lobster ravioli. I'm not no pasta conossieur by any means but the best Alfredo I've had was the seafood Alfredo from Olive Garden; and the Alfredo at this place was not as creamy as I'd like, but still delicious.you have a choice in what type of protein you want, and with the chicken we chose, you can just tell the chicken was fresh off the grill. The lobster ravioli on the other hand, was delicious as well. It came with a creamy vodka tomato base sauce with pieces of shrimp scattered. The cheese in the ravioli was cooked perfectly where the inside wasn't cold nor was it too hot that it burned your mouth.   Along with the pastas our waiter suggested to order the garlic bread and he claimed it was the best in the city. So we agreed and the actual name was \"fettunta\" -- and I was convinced. It was definitely one of these best garlic breads I've ever had. Not only was it warm and toasty, but it was brushed over with a garlic butter and had some shredded cheese on top.   Over all, though it's only been 1 time, I'm giving this 5 stars. Definitely one of the best Italian spots I've eaten at and am curious to taste whatever else they have to offer.   *BONUS* There are TV's at the bar so I was able to keep up with my March madness NCAA bracket, and the day we went there was live music playing classic songs on acoustic guitar!"}
{"text":"We drove over from Green Valley and it was good. chili Lasagna was good . A little disappointing that we could not have draft beer as they just put it in that day and the bartender could not get it to work."}
{"text":"We ordered the prosciutto and mozzarella plate with a balsamic glaze that was very good! Also ordered the meatball app to try them out with the marinara. They good, sauce was good, but it still doesn't compare to Grandma's!   For lunch we had the lobster ravioli in pink vodka sauce. They were good. Next up, was gnocchi with pesto and Gorgonzola. It was good. I think the pesto coulda used a little more flavor. But was still good. Last up, the penne pink vodka prosciutto, garlic and sundried tomatoes. The flavor of that sauce was fantastic! I would highly recommend it! Last up Nutella cheesecake and semifreddo. Both delicious!! Our waitress had the Italian accent and told us that her dad makes the semifreddo himself!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Always solid food never disappoints! Plus they deliver to mountains edge. Which  is just great! Alex is a sweetheart and always provides great service! Def try the butternut squash ravioli special!"}
{"text":"Came back again, because it was so good.  I just moved here from the Bay Area, so I'm excited and anxious to try all of the great food around the area and I'm so glad that I found this great Italian place by the house.  I LOVE the play on the name of the place! The space is cute, quaint and well decorated. (People who are docking stars because of the small space need to get over themselves and never visit a place like NYC or Hong Kong... ridic!) *gets off high horse* Back to the two most important parts...   The Service and the Food.   They were both wonderful; each time I've come here, we've been pleasantly greeted, well taken care of.. and the food comes out so quickly!  My drink never reached the bottom before it was refilled.  So service-wise, SW, you get an A+!   The owner also happened to be in while we were having lunch today as well and asked us how the calamari appetizer was that we got. He was as nice and enthusiastic as his servers, which was refreshing to see.   Now for the best part... the FOOD!  The food is amazing.  This time I had the Speck with pappardelle (my favorite kind of pasta)... the pasta was cooked perfectly, the Alfredo was just right and the portions are large.    Overall, if you come here, you'll have a great experience in both service and food. If you're not from the area, it may be a little bit off the beaten path, but make the trek; it's worth it.  The prices aren't cheap (but if you wanted cheap, you'd be having fast food and not reading this review, right?), but the food quality justifies it. Lunch for two, with two sodas and Calamari will push you past $50 easily."}
{"text":"I live across the street and absolutely love this place! I try something new every time I come. Their appetizer dish of all the sliced meats and cheese is amazing. My last dish was the spaghetti and meatballs. Waited for over a year to try it because it's an ordinary dish. Never realized it would be the best spaghetti and meatballs I had ever had! Little pricey but well worth it!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since day one! When they were just a tiny 5 table restaurant, with there deli option as well. I continue to return back for the penne alla vodka, the bobbi, and the pasta with all the seafood (can never pronounce it)! I love the bruschetta and I have to order it!! The beard is always warm and fresh. The owner is always floating around asking how things are. And luckily I always miss the bust times on purpose, so I know I can sit down for lunch or dinner.    If you had visited when the first remodeled and the service was rocky, PLEASE come back and give it a try. The food is delicious and I have gone about 8 times since then and they have their steady staff now. Who are spot on, refilling drinks, and always knowing the daily specials off of the top of their head, impressive!   I am so happy I have found this place and I will always keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"Everything was good and the atmosphere was awesome. The only reason it got 4 out of 5 stars, was due to the meal my girlfriend ordered. The sneak she ordered was to salty. But she enjoyed everything else. The waiter was awesome and also went out of his way to help my girl with her meal. I had the lasagna and it was great. We will go here again."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a go again. Stopped by my parents and my father called in the order. When he ordered my pesto the person on the line asked if it was a. Even on the menu and b. What was in it. My father had to tell their person who works there what was in pesto. It was the most bland pasta I ever tasted. I thought maybe it would be better. How can you call yourself a restaurant when you don't even know what's on your menu or what's in your dishes. Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me. I won't be fooled again and I definitely won't be giving spaghetty western another chance."}
{"text":"I loved this place best Italian food around!! Also the service was great.. I want back more then once and would recommend this place.."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Service is awesome.  We have Been here multiple times and never been disappointed.  Hands down the best authentic Italian food we found in Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for dinner...I ordered the \"bobbi\" but added chicken to it. It was good, i expected my socks to be blown away but weren't, nonetheless it was good. I'll definitely come back and try something else"}
{"text":"Don't let the name confuse you, I'm still confused about it. However, the food is amazing!! New favorite Italian spot"}
{"text":"Service is impressive, food is incredible love this place. Very authentic the food! I will absolutely be back. The wine is great!!!! The bread so yummy"}
{"text":"Prosciutto and mozzarella sandwhich is absolutely amazing defiantly recline  that to anyone ! , this place really didn't catch my eye but now this is my goto spot for a good sub ! I love that they deliver! And everyone is really nice who works there ."}
{"text":"I must say very surprising!! Very nice atmosphere and the food was delicious!! Let me start by saying Alex was great at making recommendations and prompt in most cases !!   The decor was very nice , small but perfect and the lighting was elegant!!   I had the Carbonara sauce with Linguine and chicken and had a very nice smokey flavor !! My wife had pomodoro sauce with Spaghetti and it was also amazing !!   Very good !!! We will be back !!"}
{"text":"Didn't expect too much, but I would definitely come back again. Everyone was very friendly, service was quick, and the food was amazing! I just wish it was a little bigger, but other than that having dinner here was definitely a good choice."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with spaghetti & meatballs & this place does not disappoint ! I haven't dined in yet but they're very convenient to pick up from on my way home from work . The pizza is also very good & can't wait to try more things on the menu"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food. Made the drive from far northwest.  Definitely worth it.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  There are not many restaurants in southern highlands and so I was excited another place opened up.  I ordered two salads to go.  One was the Cesar and the other was a Caprese salad.  Normally if you order a salad to go, the dressing is served on the side, so I didn't even think to ask for it that way.  I guess I should have.  Not only was there dressing already on the salad, there was SO much dressing on the Cesar salad that I couldn't even eat it.  It was absolutely drenched in the dressing!!  It was mushy and sloppy and just plain disgusting.  A $10 salad better be bomb; and they just weren't.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"We came for my birthday. Food and staff are amazing. I got the chicken piccata. The chicken was fantastic."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. I wish some pretentious A-hole didn't have to ruin the delivery option for us! Apparently, they didn't want to pay because it took too long. But this place is AMAZING... I always get \"The Bobby\" (thank you Bobby! For the suggestion!) w/ Linguine ++garlic & chicken.. Agh! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!  I've tried their Caprese Salad too- this was really good. Their fried shrimp & calamari is really good too!! My BF's dish is Chicken Marsala, which he gets EVERY time!! I've also tried their spicy linguine  & Alfredo  (if you like really rich sauces) I'm telling you- this place is amazing.. YOU MUST TRY."}
{"text":"The food was so great here...!!! Real nice and peaceful. Authentic pasta. Great made noodles. Not too hard or too soft. And the fact that you cant choose the noodles you like with whichever suace you like is just the best thing ever. There bread is feshly baked. Everything down to the canoli was just perfect. Bringing all my friends here."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  In a town where the best chefs come to open their premier restaurants, there exists this small cafe-type italian place in southern highlands. The best lasagna I've ever had.  World class tiramisu that you can buy packaged to go from their fridge.  And they even have a good wine selection..."}
{"text":"Food was superb, prices were good, atmosphere was ok, but it was busy and service really suffered.  We had the spaghetti western,  pizza, sole with pasta and a glass of wine ( all very tasty) $55 out the door.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Was taken here by a neighbor of mine and really appreciated the service. Sat at the bar and had a lovely bartender. Very attentive and sweet. The meatballs and fresh mozzarella were delicious. I had chicken parmigiana with angel hair pasta. Also, very tasty. Overall good food, good service and nice place."}
{"text":"Service: ok, the server kept talking about the staff like we were all old friends \"Jesse didn't come out last night...blah blah blah\"...it was strangely annoying. She proceeded to tell me & my husband about her night at the bar next door & all the $$ she had made hitting a jackpot. Also, how she ended up saving/spending it. Ok, that's nice, but I'd really like to order some food. She was playful with my 1 year old so, she gets a point. Food: something left to be desired. The chicken sandwich we ordered to go for my dad looked good & he enjoyed it. I had the eggplant Parmesan: just had a weird taste to it & it was a HUGE portion. My hubby had a sandwich (can't remember which or much about it) I liked the place because of the location & I wanna come in and try something different. Hope I don't get that chatty somewhat disorganized waitress."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for Italian food. We eat here a few times and month, we always bring our friends from out of town and we have ordered food for a few small parties. Great food, great service and fantastic staff."}
{"text":"Best food ever!!  Authentic Italian. Made to order.  Each meal. Family setting.  Friendly attentive staff. Deserts are fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"First time there last night.  The food and service was amazing!! I would give them a 5 but the bread and olive oil mixture was average at best.  We will be frequent visitors for sure!!"}
{"text":"Guys you absolutely rock it, the best Italian and best service and now the best food at the Black Tie at Southern Highlands!!!!  Cheers Rob and Davey!!!!!!  Keep up the good work, bring your magic into your next Southern Highlands restaurant."}
{"text":"Just updating my review since their renovation.  I went there for lunch today and am so happy and excited that this place has expanded to add a bar and very chic restaurant side with booths and tables.  The service is awesome! This will continually be our weekly dinner stop!  I am so happy this place opened in the neighborhood.  Very fun atmosphere, traditional italian style deli, friendly team of people, and incredible and affordable food!  Definitely a weekly stop for our family.  Spaghetty Western dish, butternut squash ravioli and classic spaghetti & meatballs are my favorite. And every single dessert is fresh and mouth watering!  And the from the deli... prosciutto and peppercorn cheese are amazing."}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH. NEW FAVORITE PLACE!!!! Seriously,  SO GOOD!!!!! The ONLY downside is it's a small place :( so make reservations  if you have a party larger than 4!!!! The marinara sauce takes 9 hours to make and BOY DOES IT TASTE AMAZING! I got the cheese ravioli which was cooked to PERFECTION! I cannot get enough of this place. I also believe they get  all their meat and cheese from Italy. Oh my gosh. LOVE!"}
{"text":"I liked the taste of this food, but I'm not going to lie... I only live 15 minutes away, and I was forced to stop at a gas station on the way home because of an explosive colon situation brought on by dining here. It was impossible to hold! Gross? Yes. But entirely true.  From now on, I'll stick to Olive Garden or Buca di Beppo."}
{"text":"Not the best atmosphere. That being said, the Caprice is great. My son loves their meatballs and husband loves the linguine with white clam sauce. The squash ravioli is delish! ONLY problem is..........their WINE selection is awful! All of it taste like gasoline!"}
{"text":"Walked in to place a to-go order. Lady told us to have seat and she'll be with us soon. Another family comes in, does the same. Then about 5 more people come and she took all their orders without acknowledging us so we left after 10 mins, they didn't even notice us walk out. Might try again another night but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with my most recent visit to Spaghetti Western (under new ownership).   My husband and I have dined with Spaghetti Western perhaps over a hundred times, and have never been disappointed like we were this past time we went.   We were greeted at the front and promptly seated upon arriving. As usual, we ordered an appetizer (calamari), as well as our main course --both of us ordered pasta.   My husband and I noticed something had changed from the moment we walked in the door; the music was different. We didn't really think much of it, until our food arrived. We noticed the gentleman next to us was speaking to who seemed to be the manager, complaining how his appetizer should have arrived before his main course. Perfectly understandable.   Well, sure enough both, our pastas arrived promptly, with no calamari. We weren't sure if the server had forgotten about the appetizer. We inquired and his response to us was: \"Well, the pasta cooks faster the calamari\" implying that perhaps the calamari was on its way after the main course? We were both confused, because we clearly are aware that pasta cooks faster than the calamari does. It was clearly his mistake, he should have put in the calamari first, then waited to place the pasta order?   Seen as though our server was oblivious to the fact that we were upset, we decided to speak to the manager (the same gentleman we had seen earlier talking to the customer next to us). Come to find out, his name is Robert. When I explained the problem, Robert didn't seem to really care. I then went ahead and asked if the owners were available, and he proceeds to start bashing them so unprofessionally. He goes on to tell me that they are no longer there, and that he was the new owner (once I asked him if he was the manager).   He then starts spewing information about the previous owners, how they didn't pay their bills, that their books were upside down, and all this stuff, which a) is none of my business as a customer b) shows what type of people are running this place. Needless to say, EXTREMELY unprofessional!  The funny thing was that when he first approached our table, I asked him if he spoke Italian (I am Italian myself) and with disgust answers \"no!\" So rude!  He then leaves, doesn't really apologize, and a few minutes later has the waiter drop off a to-go container at the table.   My husband and I were a bit confused as to what the waiter had dropped off. We opened the bag, and there was a to-go tiramisu. We asked the waiter what it was, and he didn't even know himself! We put two and two together and figured out it was probably some sort of apology from Robert. Robert never even stopped by the table telling us he was sorry and that he was giving us the tiramisu? It was just weird! He did walk in front of our table quite a few times, but never even looked at us or nothing.   We also noticed that the food was changed from the previous owners. The fresh pasta was raw and the calamari were slimy. It was pretty horrible. It is such a shame that the previous owners left. They were always friendly, had the best food, and it is truly unfortunate that someone like Robert feels the right to spread such mean and private information about such a humble and respectable people! Just for Robert's behavior we will never return!!"}
{"text":"Great! Great, service and food.  Right from the start was the smell of pasta in the air in this outstanding and clean Grade 'A' establishment; then the quick delicious meals and of course a fantastic price for the large servings of food.  I know my favorite Italian food restaurant will be from now on (takeout also) and this place is easy to get to and plenty of parking.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Spaghetty Western since they first opened. The food was always amazing with flavorful Italian dishes just like Italy. However, when they expanded, the quality of food and service has changed. I usually order the Chicken Piccata and Chicken Francese. Now, the dishes have NO flavor. It's too bad because they were one of the best Italian restaurants that was off the strip."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I grew up in an Italian household and my grandma made THE BEST sauce EVER. I'm sure a lot of people can understand this sentiment and even have their own person who makes the best sauce ever. Now, with that being said, I say this place comes in at a solid second, which is about as good as it gets.  I LOVE their tomato sauce. One of my favorite dishes is the Chicken Milanese. It is a simple dish, however, its simplicity really allows all of the flavor to come through and it's delicious! Another dish I really enjoy is the Pasta Carbonara and my husband loves the Pasta Diablo.  The staff is also great and I just love coming here! I even get to brush up a little on my basic Italian skills which makes me happy. xD Great hole-in-the-wall Italian place!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but the last time there we ordered lasagne. We got no bread- just a piece of lasagne. It was Ok but it seems they have gone down hill. We have moved on to other italion restaurants where we get more bang for the buck"}
{"text":"Food is really good, authentic Italian, made fresh right then and there. Get it to go though. For a place aiming to be so high end, I would think they could work on the the ambiance--definitely is not up to par with the prices of the food.   One more minor complaint: a tiny little bag of Lays brand chips does not accent the amazing sandwiches they have. They need better sides--hey, I know, PASTA?!   You can also buy high end Italian deli meats, cheeses and wines."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to update my first review for Spaghetty Western. I still love this place. It is my go to when I have an Italian craving. I pretty much get the Pasta with the Pink Vodka sauce my favorite. Great environment and great service for a dine and dash. Still, thumbs up."}
{"text":"Delicious food are sever was amazingly nice especially with are 1 yr old daughter.. I will be coming back here not just for the food but for the great service as well thx"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times now and it's been great every time. Last night I had the most amazing butternut squash ravioli. It was delicious and has this cheesy broiled topping that really made it special. The cannoli was also great. I love this place. Great for take out. Fyi there is $5 off$25 on the back of Smiths receipt from same shopping center."}
{"text":"I ordered a meatball sandwich as well as chicken Parmesan .  Very good and would recommend it.  This place can get busy so ordering to go by calling them would be a good option."}
{"text":"A nice and cute little place.  I had a cup of Tortellini Spinach Soup and a Caesar Salad.  The Penne Arrabiatta entree arrived with olives in it which I didn't realize when ordering.  I actually loved the addition of the olives and would order that again except the Arrabiatta sauce was way to spicy for me.  I like spicy food but it was just a little to much heat.    We went here on a beautiful Spring Day so we could sit outside.  There is only 1 outside table and it was taken by someone else that wasn't even dining here.  Ughh!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time since the remodel. The place looks really nice with a great atmosphere. A friend and I came in for lunch. The place was not busy. We sat in the new area and the bartender was our server. His name was Dario. I was looking for a certain dish, but he said they didnt carry it. But he recommended a different dish and described how it was prepared. He seemed very knowledgeable about the menu. So I got the baked mostaccioli with penne along with an order of garlic bread that was toasted, the dish he  recommended. It was delicious. I was very satisfied with the food and service."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food!  My wife and I were on vacation in Vegas and looking for something off the strip for dinner.  We found this place on Yelp, and we were very glad we did.   I had the chicken parmigiana sandwich...which was awesome!  My wife had the chicken Alfredo....also very good.  The staff was friendly and very helpful.  We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in southern highlands. Excellent fresh pasta & pizzas. The kids portions are huge. And the service is great. I call ahead to put our name down bc it's a small spot so if it's busy our table is usually ready when we get there."}
{"text":"This hole-in-the-wall gem has just remodeled and the food is even better than before.  The owners are friendly, the staff is on-the-ball, the food (OMG the food) and the price is so reasonable.   We have been to this spot many times and we've brought friends and family to try the amazing Italian dishes.   The chili lasagna or the butternut squash raviolis are too much to eat, and taste great as left overs.  The chicken marsala is so tasty and I get it without the pasta with grilled vegetables.   They often have specials that I wish were main menu items, but it just keeps me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Great food every time either when you dine in or carry out it always spot on! The people there are also very friendly and usually crack jokes with/about me and my country grammer but always in good fun! I would recommend anything on the menu weather you can pronounce it or not."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time on 7/12. I had the Chicken Parm and my girlfriend had the Fettucini Alfredo. The food was great and decently priced. The service was decent but not spectacular. Some of the staff just seemed annoyed to be there."}
{"text":"My review is based solely on the food...  This place is delicious! We love going here, to eat. The service on the other hand is terrible. My family and I always discuss whether we want good Italian food with bad service or ok Italian food with great service. Every time we pick the food over the service.  Everything there is so delicious but you'll be there awhile so plan on 2 1/2 hours or so."}
{"text":"So happy I found this place! Don't let the their name and signage throw you off (as it did for me, at first). Their food is great and prices are reasonable. Portions are large - we had enough leftovers for dinner tomorrow night!  For me, the highlight was the HUGE antipasto platter. $12 and you get to select 3 meats and 2 cheeses. Plus it comes with olives, roasted peppers, artichokes, and garlic bread on a bed of greens. So good!  I ordered the gnocchi with meat sauce, also good, and very filling. Not as good as my all-time favorite Rao's, but I still enjoyed it.  My hubby ordered the cioppino, which you can get mild, medium or spicy, with linguini. It was really good! Very hearty - with crab, shrimp, clams, mussels, fish, and calamari.  The restaurant is fairly small, so I can imagine it filling up quickly. The vibe is very casual. Service was good. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Spaghetty Western has the most amazing Chef in Jason. His cooking is authentic, and delicious! I'm addicted. We eat at SW at least once a week. The staff is super friendly and attentive. Even the Chef comes out from behind the counter to assist guests. I'd highly recommend the pasta with lobster in a spicy marinara sauce (has to be my favorite so far), the lobster ravioli in a pink vodka sauce is unbelievable, and just the simple pasta marinara (I like spaghetti) will blow you away!  Oh yes, Jason's Father is also an unbelievable Executive Chef (he taught Jason the art)! You can't go wrong regardless of who prepares your meal! Delicious, authentic Itallian cuisine at a fair price in a cozy Itallian Deli style atmosphere. Doesn't get much better than Spaghetty Western!"}
{"text":"Been to this place twice now, the first time was amazing but the second time was not the best.   The place is pretty small with only a few tables, not the best place for large parties, I would recommend doing take-outs.   The first time I came was soon after they opened, we were greeted quickly and the staff explained the menu to us, explained the specials for the day and were very helpful. We ordered a charcuterie platter for $12... this platter was amazing! It came with 4 different meats, garlic bread, 3 different cheeses, olives and peppers, artichokes... a huge platter only for $12!! We ordered the specials for the day and was very happy with the whole experience.   The second time they were busier, we waited a bit for service which was fine. We ordered the charcuterie platter again and it was not the same. We could tell that they were understaffed, they had lots of to-go orders and their tables were all full. The guy who took our ordered ended up making our charcuteries and it was not the same, fewer meats and cheeses, very little olives, peppers and artichoke...the presentation was also not the same. We got pastas and they tasted very good. A little disappointed because the charcuteries plate impressed us the first time and we came back mainly for the platter, but didn't get the same platter.   Definitely a good place to eat though, pastas tasted fresh, delicious sauce, nice variety of selection, you can also buy cheeses and cured meats to take home. Good place to grab an Italian sandwich or pastas for lunch."}
{"text":"In from Cincy- great vibe!  App to try is  cheese sticks -  strawberry salad is special but it's the lasagna & pizza that makes it a great spot. Top it off with tiramisu made from authentic Italian chef! Up & coming for the area!!"}
{"text":"The portions are huge!  One plate is good enough eats for two people!  I went to Spaghetti Western on the recommendation of a friend who wanted to meet me there for dinner.   Once I got here, I was promptly seated and ordered a few apps to tide me over while I waited for my friends to join me.  I first ordered the garlic bread with c, which wasn't really impressive but ok I suppose for the price.  Then, because my buddies were late, I ordered the antipasto misto, which did not disappoint - a large portion of Italian meats and cheeses were presented to me literally overflowing from the plate.   When my buddies finally made it to the restaurant, I ordered the Chicken Saltimbocca with angel hair pasta which is fried chicken wrapped in prosciutto and cheese... wow. You can imagine how good that was... it lasted me two meals... yummy."}
{"text":"Spaghetty Western is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Vegas. My review is so long overdue, it's not even funny! I promise I wasn't trying to keep it a secret, I've just been busy with school. For starters, as you can see by all of my checkins, I'm a regular and the current Duchess. I love all of the staff. The food is as good at it gets. This is a great local spot.  Alex, the waiter is an awesome guy and holds a special place in my heart! There's also a really nice Italian lady whose name I don't know but she's great too & her son is adorable. He's sometimes there at the restaurant coloring or doing school work. He's extremely well behaved. I don't remember the new owner's name either but he's friendly and personable and he's always smiling. The chef, Jason, is a prodigy. Anything he cooks, he cooks well. And he looks good doing it too. Haha! Once you get to know the staff, they'll remember your order, etc. It's the extra little touches that Spaghetty Western provides that mean a lot.  If you are missing something from a restaurant that discontinued your favorite dish, went out of business, or is no longer local, tell the staff here what was in it and presto you are eating the same version if not better. It's pretty incredible how well Jason hits the ball out of the park every single time I eat here.   The two dishes I always order and recommend are:   My #1 Go-To Dish which is Penne ala Vodka with Prosciutto, Sundried Tomato and Roasted Garlic. This is now an item on the menu under \"Anytime Specials\" since I ordered it so much and some of you Yelpers out there have been ordering it too because of my uploading photos here, according to the staff. Call it \"The Bobbi\" because it's easier... and they'll know I sent you. :) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spaghetty-western-las-vegas?select=w0eJjvV0cZTywH4qt0dDiw&userid=ZcFB7xOpJufgX9hHPFh9mQ#1Hn77oj0HISqWbqOzn69AA  Another Fave... Gnocchi with a mixture of Fra Diovolo & Meat Sauces, Diced Tomatoes, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Sliced Garlic and Basil.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spaghetty-western-las-vegas?select=w0eJjvV0cZTywH4qt0dDiw&userid=ZcFB7xOpJufgX9hHPFh9mQ#BW_UpEbq25kMbC6Ol3Kf0Q  I've been a customer since the very beginning and I'm not going anywhere. The atmosphere is really nice and it's come a long way since it first opened. It is a small place but it is cozy. They'll make you feel right at home. I recommend you stop by and check it out if you happen to be on the south side of town. And please leave me a comment and let me know what you think of my favorite dish."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Delicious tasting authentic Italian food with homemade pasta, fantastic price point, an excellent portions! Very very happy and will be returning!"}
{"text":"Just had a FANTASTIC dinner at Spaghetty Western.. The Caprese salad was so fresh and light with the addition of prosciutto Delicious...The baked butternut squash ravioli  was not heavy like at some places.. The service was very friendly and helpful. It was my first time and I was very impressed. It's not too big so get there early. Oh I was smart enough to take the Terra Massoud home with me and enjoy did email Inslee. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Going to change my review and lower stars from 4 to 1. Service has gone downhill. Last time I was in to place a to go order I was ignored by cashier at front; ignored by bartender; then when I asked a waitress for a menu, she said menus were at the front with a wave of her hand (great customer service)--there were none; when I said there were no menus, I got an eye roll and and a huff and puff to get me a menu. I walked out.  Tonight my husband picked up 2 sandwiches and a pizza. Why does the menu say \"toasted sub\" and instead I get soft square bread? My husband also asked for no tomatoes on my sandwich and no onions on his sandwich. Guess what made it into the sandwiches--onions and tomatoes! My husband was also ignored by the bartender when tying to get some water. Apparently texting on her phone was more important. Totally obnoxious, lacking in customer service and rude. Bartender needs to get a grip. No thanks. I can spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I personally love the food but the service isn't top notch which is why I will not be returning. The servers and managers are very unprofessional"}
{"text":"We dined here last night. It was pretty empty, so wet got say right away. Our server came to our table to take drink orders quickly. Though it took a good ten minutes to get our drinks. When he did come back he told us the specials. I decided to try the osso buco special. My husband ordered the spaghetty western, and my son ordered the kids spaghetti and meatballs. The waiter also asked us if we wanted an app, but we said no. So he said we do have plain bread if you want. The bread was warm, the oil very boring. On to the food, spaghetty western my husband loved. My son liked the meatballs, but the actual spaghetti not so much. I tried it his tasted like they emptied a can of tomato sauce on the pasta. Mine on the other hand was great....however I learned after we received our check it was 41.95!!! Now this alone made me drop a star, with an entree \"special\" that much I think the waiter should have told us that. The prices on the menu are decent, so that was not expected. It took us fifteen minutes to get our check and get the Bill paid. To which my husband was about to walk out, he had lost his patience, especially because there was a total of 4 tables. We will probably come back next time, I will ask the price of the specials."}
{"text":"This place has some amazing food and service. You have to ask for Alex. The food is authentic Italian. The ambiance is relaxing but classy. Love the old school movie posters. Check it out you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First food review since moving to Vegas, glad it's for this place. Nice little place with an awesome waitress(Carrie). She suggested the \"anytime specials\" which regulars meals became menu items. I started with a side salad and vodka Bobbi? WOW!! Grand slam this might of been the best pasta I've had in my 26 years of existence. Will come back and bring friends and family that visit! Can't wait to try more dishes in the future!"}
{"text":"I tried this place because it was very busy when I drove by it, and it had lots of good reviews on yelp. I'm glad I did! I had a great dinner and it was very affordable. I went with the classic spaghetti and meatballs. The food was hot when served, and the pasta was not over or under cooked. The place is small but charming, and the staff was friendly and seemed very genuine with their service. I also enjoy supporting a local business. I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely unbelievable, my first time here made such a great impression on me, from the food to the service, to the wine, that I am now a forever customer!"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and the food is amazing! A little pricey on the food and alcohol but I'll survive."}
{"text":"Nice comfortable atmosphere, excellent service, and a robust menu with lots of delicious options for pasta, pizza and sandwiches.  Very enjoyable meal and I will certainly return."}
{"text":"The Bobbi was delicious and really flavorful. The staff was super friendly. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Not knowing much in the area we stopped into Spaghetty Western. Always a great sign when people are there enjoying the food even at off hours in the day. The Spaghetti, Chicken Parm, Meatball Sando, and Butter Nut Squash ravioli were all amazingly good. Service was great and very helpful getting through their robust menu."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service in a small but relaxed atmosphere. We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation at Spaghetty Western for Father's Day dinner. Some of our family was coming from out of town, and their flight ran late. Our large party made the it in the door 15 minutes from their closing time.  Working in service myself I felt bad for coming in so close to closing, but everyone greeted us warmly when we finally arrived.  Our server was diligent and friendly- cracking jokes at the table and taking picture of our family when we wanted to capture a moment, AND the food was delicious.  Lastly- My dad said that the lasagna he had there was the best he's ever had. And he LOVES lasagna.   The signage doesn't give enough credit to the quality inside..."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never tried this before. Of course I would try it as I am moving out of town!! I was craving pasta and this popped up 1st. Great staff, great customer service and GREAT FOOD!!!  Got the chicken Alfredo with a side of the pink vodka sauce.  I'll be here at least 2 more times before I move in 9 days!"}
{"text":"I know first thought Spaghetty not Spaghetti?? Huh?? Okay maybe just corky gimmick too get you walk in the door or meant too help restaurant stand out from the crowd?? No matter the case one thing you will find is good food, great service, affordable prices, and  small business owner that cares about customers from minute walk in. Bonus if urge too take some fresh parmesan cut from block, deli cuts, or even fresh dessert serve by the piece too go Spaghetty Western has you covered all ways Italian.  The restaurant set up like standard deli restaurant. Not many tables but also bar stool area that can eat on. The menu have paper menu look at and also computerized version too look at hanging from at the wall. Sneaky but make sure check the specials of the day on chalkboard off too the side. They do great job of explaining the specials that day if you miss it.   I ordered the Spaghetty Western since carb loading for 50miler bike ride next day. So thinking heavy pasta dish with protein and pasta. The Spaghetty Western is solid choice. The spaghetty (believe fresh tasted like too me) combine with the sausage, pancetta, and peas really nice light tomato sauce was awesome. Not heavy loaded with pure chunks of tomato or too think that not much of sauce. It had the right balance. The pancetta and sausage could eat by itself! Sure would order anything with either one of those meats on the menu. It came with order of garlic bread. It not often would rage about garlic bread comes with you entree. Garlic Bread showed me much they care about the little things even though comes with my entree. Two pieces had nice spread of butter, garlic, and chopped parley. Besides it came out HOT crispy garlic bread. The portion size was great not too mention very affordable.   The only negative comment would say is that stack of dirty plates that sitting on table next too me the whole time. Not sure if lack of staff cause small business. Still nothing that would stop me from coming back for more pasta or trying more of the menu. The desserts all look great and definitely yelpers rave about. I make sure leave room next time. If in the area in need of solid Italian food not going break the bank need too stop in and no worries about the corny name. Never judge book by its cover my friends..."}

Everything tasted suberperb and were plated well. Special shout out to our sever Alex who made our lunch great!"}
{"text":"So glad I came in today. I got gnocchi with vodka sauce and Italian sausage. It's delicious! I am excited to come in this boutique restaurant for a date night in the future!"}
{"text":"So I've been here about 5 times now and every time has been a terrible experience. Just recently I've tried calling to place a take out order, and no one would pick up the phone!   I drove out there to order in person, and I was greeted by 6 staff having a conversation in fluent Italian totally ignoring my existence. When I tried to put in my order they refused to take my order because something was wrong with the stove. I know for a fact they have other items on the menu that doesn't require a stove.  This was only my latest experience, but not only the first time they refused to take my order or completely got my order wrong with sub-par average food!   Very sad! Considering these guys seem to be authentic Italians, not to mention, I am half Italian, grew up in Italy and am disappointed this is the way they choose to represent our culture!  Deplorable customer service. Management couldn't care less. Legitimately shocked this place managed to get somewhat decent reviews."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant for the first time and it was great I'll definitely be back! I dined in at lunch time and had a chicken parmigiana sandwich. It came out in a timely manner and was amazing. The huge portions left me stuffed!"}
{"text":"We went here because we were in the neighborhood and decided to try it out. The restaurant itself is really small (only a few tables). The service was good but the food was just ok and a bit on the pricey side. I've definitely had better Italian food."}
{"text":"\"Cibo Squisito\". Now does that tell you the legitimacy of an italian restaurant if I want to google the language for something witty to begin the review with? Ha-ha.  I don't know where to start to be honest as there is so much to touch upon, but the bottom line is this place is legit and will a top contender in this area for years to come! The strip mall it's located in has quite the echelon when it comes to culinary gems and Spaghetty Western is no exception!  I'm quite sad that my Dad is moving out of the area, but being introduced to some top notch food was certainly a parting gift even I can deal with. It is family owned and he does frequent here enough that he has been able to build a rapor with the owner and family. That is a rarity and something that you can't teach nor replace when it comes to this type of stuff. I had an opportunity to meet them as well and first impression alone you can tell that they put their hearts into making this place run like a well oiled machine.   From what I do remember of the visit is that from the instant popularity there were people everywhere and with it being such a small venue that turned people away who didn't stick out waiting for a table (their loss). They do take reservations which after hearing the above should be a no brainer to ensure that your experience is 5 stars and beyond like mine. My Dad mentioned that they are expanding into the vacant business next to them so right there tells me that they were aware of the issue and will put every inch to good use.   The menu itself pretty much has something for everyone and any walk of life, but I set myself up for success going simple and selecting the spaghetti and meatballs. I partnered penne pasta for the occasion with the meatball and it was enough to slap me across the face and yell \"Ciao Bella\" from the rooftops as each bite digests. The pasta was soft and seemingly melted away as it was consumed. Between the marinara sauce and the meatball those alone blew me away. The marinara was thick in texture, but really coated the pasta well and came out swinging flavored masterfully. All I have left to say which makes me wish I had culinary turrets is MEATBALLS MEATBALLS MEATBALLS! These are off the chain here and honestly the best I have ever had to date. MUST TRY! It had a bit of spicing to it, but very moist circular slabs of delicious here! I apparently was a giggle magnet at the table as I even gave appearance to my once retired Kobayashi wiggle as I had my first bite. You know you've got an ace when your food does that to your body!  Another highlighted point which would be a disservice if not mentioned was the lobster ravioli. My wife has not stopped talking about this for a good 2 months now and for her to stop in her tracks is crazy. The amount of lobster does equal up to the price tag and I even got shocked by the amount in there as I'm used to maybe a piece here and there not the whole lobster famiglia! There were seven pieces total, but was filling no less. After sampling that one myself I put that on my last meal list when I die so I can go out feeling like royalty!  If you are ever in the neighborhood or need an escape from the strip life make the 10 minute drive here as you won't be sorry by any means. I hope they continue to grow within the area and I cross my fingers for them to branch out to California someday. I doubt that would be the case though, but as a testament to them I'd drive 4 hours in the event of meatball meat sweats. Ha-ha! Grazie di cuore! I can't wait to go back here pronto!"}
{"text":"My family had dinner here tonight and the food and service were amazing!  My sons (5 & 7) split spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were delicious, almost as good as my own. . My husband had the linguine and clams. The clams were very flavorful and there were a ton on his plate.  I had the penne with pink vodka sauce, sun dried tomatoes and prosciutto.  It was so tasty I didn't want to stop eating, but I wanted to have it again for lunch tomorrow. We decided on desert, too. The cannoli were fresh and the tiramisu was decadent. My boys each had the ice cream and devoured every bite and   Wore some of it home on their little faces.  Definitely a must try!  Looking forward to trying other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"It was cool I think I would like to try something diff next time so I can be impressed!! But the customer service was amazing"}
{"text":"Since the business expanded, their service and the quality of the food have declined significantly.   1. You now enter a \"fine\" dining section through the \"take out\" door.  2. Service is scant.  3. Inordinate delay getting food. 4. Marinara sauce is too salty (based on two take outs & 1 in room experience).  5. The bread that's served is terrible/horrific.   Really hope owner(s) take heed. Must ask, was chef replaced (would explain much)?"}
{"text":"Finally ordered from this place since I've driven past it a million times and let me tell you as a born & raised Las Vegas resident with the best food at my disposal I am very pleased with the quality and fast service here. Restaurant quality food to go is what gets me through to work in this busy city. And even though they forgot my garlic bread but made it on the spot in 5 minutes along with misquoted pricing in which the cashier apologized and honored the original price, these mistakes are easily accessible by their wonderful food and service.   This city is very competitive & I strongly recommend this cozy little restaurant. They recently expanded with a nice restaurant/bar, from just being more of a fast food pickup restaurant. Wish they had delivery. Not a fan of bite or grubhub. Fees are too expensive, and I'd rather spend more involved the food and not all the fees.   On to the food, penne Bobbi is to die for. Not too saucy but a wonderful pink vodka sauce with prosciutto, sundried tomatoes, and garlic. Which should be served with garlic bread but thankfully I ordered some. Also must order Alex's salad, spring mix, sundried tomatoes, red peppers, artichokes. salami, olives, asiago cheese, and balsamic glaze. Everything is fresh. Little pricey but well worth it, always in support of small business owners. Screw olive garden, it's offensive to real Italian food."}
{"text":"I hate to have to update this with a negative review but hey... Bottom line is there is no consistency. There have been issues since they restaurant expanded and reopened. I have been waiting and giving time for the \"growing pains\" to pass, but 3+ months is long enough. We come weekly for the most part, so we are regulars and used to love this place above all others.  1- Almost every time we come something is wrong with our order. Tonight my son's sandwich had sauce on it when I asked for it on the side. Then my fettuccine pesto was cheesy, as in cheese added in to the sauce. That wouldn't be a problem if that is what I  ordered or if that was even the standard for the pesto sauce. Usually when I get the pesto there is no cheese in the sauce. This is just the example of tonight. I have a laundry list I could share.  2- Staff changes a lot. I know how hard it is to hire and retain good people, but this is probably part of the food issue too.  3- That guy. His name is David, or Dave, is what I've been told. On one occasion he was pushy, and spoke to me like I was new here, and told me that I really needed reservations from now on if I come on a Friday. Another time I was here at lunch time and he was walking around loudly reprimanding the kitchen staff. Another time he was literally standing next to my husband waving his arm around my husbands head, yelling \"hey\", attempting to get a waiters attention to take care of something. The other owners just take care of things themselves, like clearing tables if needed. He also hits on the clientele. I have a friend that used to sit at the bar and won't even come alone any more because of him. Also, I read another negative Yelp review and his response was absolutely so unprofessional, and argumentative, I was enraged for the other person. I don't know him personally, and this isn't a personal attack. This is legitimate accounts of what I've personally seen.   They have some wonderful staff that have been here for years, and we love to see them when we come. It is really like hanging out with family when they are here. The owners, not David, are amazing. I am always so happy when I see they are here and love to watch them interacting with everyone. However, I always let them know when there is an issue and it's still on going. So maybe reviews for all to see will inspire them to make some changes."}
{"text":"I found this place one night when we were dining at the tapas place next door. So I wanted to give it a try.   When we walked in, I instantly noticed how small and limited their seating was. But it was only half full when we came in. It wasn't super clear if it was seat yourself type of place or what. But the server said sit anywhere so we did.   To comment the server wasn't the friendliest but he wasn't rude it was just not a lot of personality to work with there. We didn't ask for any recommendations because we weren't getting like oh please talk to me vibe.   The food did however come out fast.  We got the meatballs for appetizers, boyfriend got lasagna for main dish and I got this penne pasta with sausage and peppers with a red sauce.  The meatballs were ok not a lot of flavor to them. The lasagna had a flavor that we were not familiar with so we thought it was off. My boyfriend always compares lasagna with the one from guisseppes so he says its the best and the one at this place was no comparison. As for my pasta it was just ok. The penne was cooked perfectly. But it lacked flavor. I only ate a little bit and took the rest home since I hate to waste food.   It's not a come back place for us sorry!"}
{"text":"Went for my sons 32 birthday. Not only was the food excellent but service by Alex  was totally on point. We were well taken care of and I would strongly recommend this place to anyone wanting excellent food and great friendly service."}
{"text":"This place IS FREAKING AMAZING! My favorite if you're looking for recommendations is the LOBSTER RAVIOLI with garlic bread MMMMMMMM."}
{"text":"Solid South Vegas Italian player located in a really good strip mall.  Service was 5 star even at lunch time.  Had the delicious veal Saltimbocca with prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella with the perfect al dente linguini.  Also ordered a lasagna that was good but not great.  Their red sauce was slightly off, needed more sweetness and spice of oregano and the top of lasagna should have been slightly burnt and crunchy to add that decadent texture to it that would have taken it over the top.  Overall good vibe there, lots of food passion, would dine there again."}
{"text":"The best place for the freshest ingredients, freshly made pasta, freshest everything. Go there, you won't regret it. A word of advice? Get there early or make reservations. It is a small restaurant in a strip mall, and it fills up fast with a very loyal patronage. FYI: the restaurant will soon expand and basically double in size. Cannot wait!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful local restaurant. We ordered 2 entrees (Chicken Piccata and the Chicken Alfredo) and garlic bread for our appetizer. The food was delicious and the staff was so attentive and friendly. The owner stopped by our table to check on us. We will definitely be frequent guests."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here three times now and they have yet to disappoint. The food is fabulous and the service is great. I love that you can tell how fresh everything is."}
{"text":"After hearing my friend rave about this place, I decided to check it out since we have similar palates. We decided to dine in. The casual Italian deli is small with 6-8 tables. When we walked in, we were the only customers. I worry when I don't see any customers at a restaurant. I think is the food good? Why isn't anyone here?   The male server greeted us right away. We ordered garlic bread, meatball sub, porcini mushroom pappardelle, and a nutella cheesecake. Another party came in and slowly more people showed up. Also, noticed there were some take out orders.   We said we were sharing so they were nice to split both of our entrees for us. Everything was delicious, just like Italian home cooking. We didn't finish everything because Italian food can be heavy and the portions are big.  As we were leaving, the place was full and some people came in to pick up their orders. We came at the right time, a little before 6 p.m.  Also, found out they deliver in my area so glad to hear I can add another place to my delivery list for the days I'm feeling lazy and hungry."}
{"text":"This place has \"upped\" their game with the new seating/bar addition and the remodel of the old space!  The atmosphere is casual but well-done: cozy and warm; NOT loud; with just the right scale of bar to booths to tables.  The separation between restaurant and take-out/deli area is great - people waiting for those services aren't standing around in the restaurant area taking up space.  I love that it is NOT a sport's bar with gaming machines stuck in the bar top and huge TV's on every wall.  It does NOT have a blaring sound system - you can actually talk to the person across the table from you - how refreshing!  They haven't packed the space with tables, so you aren't sitting on top of the people next to you.  The service staff is friendly and professional and seem invested in their workplace.  This is not a place for large groups - no banquet room/separate room.  This isn't a \"kiddie\" place - it's a grown-up establishment that can accommodate children who eat more than \"chicken nuggets\".  The food is great:  warm, crusty bread with seasoned olive oil for a dip; David's Milan Salad is extraordinary; the pizza dough is made fresh daily and the pizza's are HOT out of the oven & are gourmet style (not meat heavy); the lasagna and ravioli were so good!  The chopped salad looked awesome and the antipasto plate was delicious!  The desserts are made in-house and are fresh and light: tiramisu, crème puffs, cheesecake, cannoli, tiny fruit crème pies.  They are currently wine & beer only; but expect a full liquor license by the middle of July. Definitely the best place in the Southern Highlands area for a meal out with friends or a casual dining experience for guests in town."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today & it was AMAZING!! So amazing in fact that I am ordering dinner for the whole family from here tonight!! I want to try everything on the menu!  My one and only complaint is that I wish it was big enough to eat dinner comfortably more restaurant like, but I get why they have it the way they do. The food is so good! I've never had Italian food like this! The gentleman that was there was so sweet and helpful! His amazing Italian accent just adds more charm to the place! It's a must try!! Such a great addition to the Southern Highlands community!"}
{"text":"Excellent pastas, salads, sandwiches, and dessert. The only think missing is a little ambiance. I'll sacrifice that for the flavor, well worth it. Great as a carry-out establishment."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Owners are sweet and friendly. Food is fresh every single time I've ordered as a dine-in or as delivery or to-go. I LOVE that they deliver, but always expect it to be a little long (about 30mins-1 hour) to arrive, especially during busy lunch or dinner hours.   It's clean. It's wonderful. I really can't say bad things about this place. Some say the service is slow as a dine-in, and it can be sometimes, but it's not like employees are on their cellphones messing around. They're usually doing something for someone else or something in the back like their side work. I haven't experienced such slow service that would make a experience a bad one."}
{"text":"This place was great! We were greeted as soon as we walked in and invited to sit wherever we wanted, always a bonus.   Our waitress was Carrie and I can't say enough good things about the service she provided. Watching her handle the flow of people through the front door, the phone for delivery/pickup orders, and the other couple aside from us in the restaurant was impressive. She didn't skip a beat. She even refilled our drinks when she saw that we were low, while on the phone taking a delivery order. She was also very nice and warm and stopped by our table just to ask how everything was, crack a few jokes, etc. She bagged up our food when we were done and couldn't finish, didn't just hand us boxes and a check. That was super nice of her considering the amount of work she had going on. Once again, the service she provided was amazing.  The food was definitely on par with the service. I had the oven baked penne with meat sauce and my fiancé had the penne alla vodka with prosciutto, sundried tomatoes, and garlic. Both dishes were excellent. The meat sauce on mine wasn't too watery or oily, was just perfect. The dish my fiancé had was downright awesome. Can't go wrong with any of those ingredients, and they were executed very well. Pasta was cooked al dente, which is how I like it!  We got two cannoli's to go as well, and those were delicious. Nice, smooth, pastry cream with a flakey crust. Drizzled with chocolate and powdered sugar. Great stuff!  We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"DO go here for excellent food! I had the house salad and the sole fillet and both were amazing. My sister had the penne vodka with sun dried tomatoes from the specials list and she had equally great things to say.  Space is limited to maybe 10 tables so if you plan to go during peak dining times, getting a table will prove difficult. We arrived at 4pm and all but 2 tables filled.   DO NOT go here for fast service or for friendly staff (unless you know people that work there). I was rudely ignored when I entered the restaurant by a man who later introduced himself to others as Pasquale. He saw people he knew who arrived after me and greeted/hugged them, sat them, got them waters and 2 appetizers before we had even received an ice water. The server we had cared little that we were there which aligns with other Yelp reviews of this restaurant. The woman who brought out our entrees was however the most friendly and personable employee at that establishment. It's too bad she wasn't our server.  I will return the following expectation: that service will not be great nor fast but that the quality of food will be worth the trip."}
{"text":"Heard great reviews on this restaurant and tried it last night. Food was amazing!!! Authentic spaghetti sauce and meatballs were fantastic! My son ordered a cheese pizza and have to say that's probably the best pizza we have ever had out here in Vegas!!  Service was ok but food makes up for it!! Definitely a must try restaurant. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"When I walk into a new restraunt you rarely know what to expect. I thought I would try the Italian meatloaf lunch portion. Thinking I would be safe from eating to much. Lol. There is a heaping amount of spaghetti and 2 huge slices of meatloaf with bread and an Italian bbq sauce. UNBELIVABLE. Great food great process and the best of all I have dinner to. If you haven't yet. Check it out. John"}
{"text":"This is by far our #1 place to go. The service is outstanding! Dine outside, at the bar, inside, or get it to go. Favorites are mozzarella sticks, the batter is homemade. Daily specials, happy hour, and full bar. We've been coming here for awhile and it's our go to place in the souther highlands and mountains edge area."}
{"text":"First at this restaurant, was pretty darn good. Loved mushroom stuffed raviolis with grilled octopus, shrimp and chicken in creamy sauce. The flavor was on point. Our appetizer was amazing melon with prosciutto on top of spinach n balsamic glaze. My husband loved his dish too. We didn't get dessert but looked amazing. It's a small place so reservation is good. It's a very casual place too."}
{"text":"Love this little hidden NY style deli and restaurant ;) great food and cured meats with house made cheeses. There Cannoli's are one the best I have ever had. FYI they also deliver ;). I usually order the meat ball app with a chicken Caesar and there house special, which changes daily ;)."}
{"text":"The best Ceasar salad..very fresh dressing, taste fresh garlic and anchovies..delicious.  I get the chicken,  have the plain sometimes..still good. Order take out 2 times a week..Canolis are to die for..Tonight they forgot the garlic bread.  :("}
{"text":"My kids love the spaghetti with meatballs here. They say, \"it's the best!\" I enjoy the Mac and Cheese. The baked pasta with various cheeses is my personal fave here. Not your ordinary Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Great food, and the place is run by the owner and his wife. Love seeing small businesses that make fresh real food."}
{"text":"Their pink vodka penne with prosciutto (the Bobbi) is so good that I always come back for more! Each pasta dish comes with a side of garlic bread. This is one of my favorite places for pasta, but it can get a little expensive. Nonetheless, great food and consistent friendly service!"}
{"text":"I have ordered the butternut squash ravioli special many times now. Its always amazing. I have also enjoyed the lasagna a few times. This is pretty damn good Italian food!!!!!"}
{"text":"Spaghetty Western catered our wedding and it was perfect!!  The food is so delicious and so affordable.  We love the Chicken Parm, but all the dishes we've tried have been amazing.  It's real authentic Italian food in a cozy and welcoming environment.  Highly recommend visiting our friends at Spaghetty Western!!"}
{"text":"Tonight there was a male chef that had all the women drooling,  bit not from the food. The food was full of flavor, not just salt.  The clams linguini had very small but tasty clams.  The lasagna portions are yo be shared.  It's just a good Mom and Pop Italian place with home made East coast style Italian great food.  It's not high end or glitzy, it's not a fake factory of greetings.  Staff here are sincere and wholesome, so they share what they share as if you are family.   There's no glitter here and this is exactly what an Italian locals place should be.  No mass production and no factory style franchise,  this is an original.   Keep the Sexy male chef out front. ..women will come."}
{"text":"Silly name, excellent Italian food! This is what I love in a restaurant. Local ownership, great variety and some of the tastiest pasta gravies anywhere. Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"The food was okay. The Alfredo sauce needs more seasoning. The small metal tables belong outside, not in the restaurant. The fans reflecting off the tables gave the feeling of strobe lights. The waitress had long, loose flowing hair which made me wonder how it stays out of the food she serves. I'd only go back for pick up."}
{"text":"I love this place ... The Pasta is Great!!! One of the best I ever had... Is a small restaurants but huge plates..."}
{"text":"Most Amazing Food Ever! Healthy low Carb meals available too! Made to order! Its perfect for the Man who can eat everything and the woman watching her weight. They have even designed a special salad just for me!"}
{"text":"Fellow Californians over here! We met up with a few friends in Nevada and happen to eat at this place. Our friends have been here before but we have never heard of it. Well, let me just say, I need one of these in California!! The mozzarella sticks were hand breaded and the perfect amount of spices and cheese. I ordered the chicken parm and it was the best I ever had!!! My fiancé ordered the same thing and he hates Italian food and he loved it!! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I saw the sign going up and the name intrigued me. I was thinking Spaghetti (Italian) western (B.B.Q) I wasn't sure what variety the menu would have. Well I was wrong but that's ok because I found a great Italian deli. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They walked me through the menu and showed me what items were in the deli case. The man helping me reminded me of Gru in the Despicable me movies (I mean that as a compliment). I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and a cup of potato soup. The soup was fantastic. The spaghetti and meatballs were amazing. I will definitely be back. -1 star for not having any minions. :-)"}
{"text":"Check it out !!!! Get anything on the SPECIAL board!!!! Chef Jason spinellli will turn you on to some amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled into Spaghetty Western a two years ago on a visit to LV from the east coast. The staff and the owner, David, make me feel very much at home. The food was great and the crowd at the bar was fun.  I have made a point of visiting Spaghetty Wester on all my trips to LV and haven't been disappointed . In fact, it keeps getting better and better!"}
{"text":"Another AMAZING meal from this fabulous restaurant!!! I love their new space since expanding, cute little bar area was added and it is so pretty! The people are still friendly as always and make you feel like you just walked into a friends home for dinner each and every time. We LOVE it here and will continue to frequent this spot!!"}
{"text":"I was confused about this restaurant's logo and décor alongside the Italian menu until I read that Spaghetti Western is a bonafide genre of Western films produced and directed by Italians.  This place serves food from Italian immigrants who fell in love with movies like \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" by Sergio Leone.  I'm still not sure where the western flavor is factored in... maybe in the soda and chip choices, or the fact that their Tortellini is shipped from New York... but one thing is for sure.  Even if their menu is quite Italian (with an Italian speaking grandmother in the back of the kitchen)... any American would love this kind of food.  Their servings are large and their $12 antipasto platter can make 3 or 4 people extremely happy.  It comes with peppers, olives, sundried tomatoes, artichokes (sooo good) and you get to choose 2 kinds of cheeses and 3 types of cold cuts.  We went for fontina, gorgonzola, salame, coppa and pancetta and all were uhmazing.  Real good stuff, and they even brought out complimentary Prosciutto di Parma which was melt in your mouth good.  The plate comes with 2 garlic bread slices so you might want to order more if you are a group sharing.  Their garlic bread was standard but had a few lovely chili flakes to give it a little kick.  We then had 1 of their 3 soups of the day, the spinach and tortellini soup.  Honestly I was expecting a cream based broth, but it was a nice surprise to get something healthy and tasty, plus the bowl was as large as my head!  Hubby had the Carbonara which was good, but if you are a stickler for al dente you might want to request that.    We were unfortunately too full to try dessert and will definitely have to go back for the bindi cakes and tiramisu, as well as the awesome lookin porkchops and vegetable lasagnas.  Great food, good wine, large portions and low prices... go with fam/friends NOW and see if Spaghetty Western can rub off on you too.  Now I gotta go see those Sergio movies."}
{"text":"One of the best places in town to get a meatball sandwich. The place has a cool decor with all Sergio Leone movie posters and the staff is real friendly to everyone that walks in. I always like to support local businesses especially when it comes to good food. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Really good Italian food.  I must say this place is way better than any Italian restaurant I've ever been too. You can really taste the quality and freshness in their food. I've been here a couple times now and I've been impressed by the flavors of the sauces. The gnocchi is out of this world b/c it's so garlicky and the potato dumplings are so tender; it's my all time favorite dish here. The service is fair the first couple times my family and I we're served by a blonde waitress and she seemed a little off. The last time I came here (yesterday) the service was way better. I went w/ my friend and we were served by one of the chefs. He was very pleasant, attentive and smiled. (Smiling is a plus for me) Hands down the best restaurant in Southern Highlands."}
{"text":"If you live even remotely close to this place and have not eaten here, I don't know what you are doing with your life. Some of the best Italian food in the city, hands down. Start with either a caprese salad or an antipasto salad. I always get the penne with pink sauce and meatballs. Outstanding stuff."}
{"text":"You're going to love this spot!  Best little Italian restaurant in Vegas. I'm a local who has lived here my whole life.  We've been looking for something that rivals the great Italian places we've visited around the world.  This one is the one."}
{"text":"Oh My Gosh, Georgie had I had Lunch here on Thursday and I must say the Linguine, Clams and Mussels Fra Diavolo was amazing as was Georgie's Cavatelli Rustica  pair that with a glass of Cianti and Tira Misu for dessert and it was a wrap. For good measure one of the owners I forgot his name and I do apologize he was very nice and gracious gave us a Tira Misu for dessert, can I say Delicious!!!  Please stop by if you're in the southern highlands and Cactus area, you won't be disappointed...."}
{"text":"I am a true Italian through and through and this has to be the best Italian food in all of Las Vegas! I've tried many Italian restaurants on the strip and nothing compares to this! Their food is absolutely delicious and you pay for what you get! It's a must try my favorite place to go"}
{"text":"Really good food and atmosphere! Love that we have this place in the neighborhood! Make a reservation before you go!!"}
{"text":"We visit Las Vegas no less than 3 times per year. We have our favorite places to eat and we look forward to going to them when we're there.  Spaghetty Western is our new favorite place.  I was looking on Yelp for a new restaurant to try, because we're staying in an unfamiliar part of town near SouthPoint.    I was curious about the name because there's a restaurant called Spaghetti Western in Houston, Texas that I've always wanted to try and haven't, yet.  I'm reading the reviews and they're all good, except one.  The best part of his review was the owner's reply. It was, bar none, the best reply. Ever. I had to try this restaurant because the owner took a stand for his staff. He earned my respect, before I stepped into his restaurant.  When we arrived (it's a Monday night, btw) it's bustling. We're a little surprised because it's in a shopping center, but inside it's a small intimate restaurant with a dessert case full of delicious looking treats, a bar and several tables.  We are greeted and seated almost right away.  We're near the bar at first and later moved to a booth.   Our waiter, the waitstaff and the manager provided excellent customer service. I am a stickler for customer service and Las Vegas is one of the most friendly places I've ever visited.   We got the toasted ravioli appetizer. Garlicky buttery ohmygoodness served with marinara.  I ordered the Eggplant Involtini.  My favorite Italian dish that is almost never on a menu except at Spaghetty Western. The capellini served al dente. Wow. They were channeling my grandfather.  It was so good. It tasted homemade and definitely made with care and by someone who loves food and how it tastes.  My girlfriend got penne (al dente , also) with pink vodka sauce and grilled chicken. The flavor was divine.  I had a glass of Chianti with my meal and the flavors of the sauce complimented my wine.    Without a doubt, this was one of the best and definitely one of my most favorite meals in  Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place.  When it first opened, it was great value and great food.  Now?  Every bite I had was outrageously overpriced and tasted terribly and was sooo over seasoned.  The staff was also rude, I will not be back."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the size of portion and quality of food for such an affordable price. The customer service was great. It took a little long for food to come out but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food and excellent service in a small but nice place"}
{"text":"I have been eating lunch at Spaghetty Western for the last few months a couple of times each week . Their food is excellent and authentic Italian fare .  Best meatballs in the valley! The marinara sauce is made fresh daily, sweet and delicious with great tomato flavor . Homemade soups that are better than moms , sorry mom. I took home veal parmigiana today for tonight's dinner . First of all the veal was large enough for two people and I could cut the veal with a fork , so tender and pounded thin. The service is timely and good , the owner David is present on most nights . The Italian meat and cheese selection at the deli counter is to die for , is there a more lovely cured meat than Speck ? I think not!  Do yourself a huge favor , go by for lunch or Dinner  You'll be glad you did !   Update !!! 5/28/2017 Its been quite a long time since I've visited SW. We met some friends for Saturday night dinner . Alex was very happy to see us and sat us down right away , Joe was our server and attended to us well . The atmosphere was relaxing , not too loud, but busyness under control . Our salads were fresh looking and excellent . I ordered my fav veal parm , my wife ordered the mushroom and octopus salad , my companion ordered the barb , his wife chicken Marsala. The  food came in a timely manner and as usual my VParm was spot on , fork tender , cheesy, and the marinara sauce was a stand out i have missed having .  My buddy's \"Barb\"was excellent in presentation and taste .  I love the freshly grated parm just before you take that first bite . Nice touch ! The only complaint, the chicken Marsala ,came with the wrong pasta that Joe  remedied.  The desserts were good but the Red Velvet was fantastic ! This place is worth the trip !   Update ,  Im a fan of SW ! I often dream about their meatball sandwiches. been going there since they opened , seen a lot of people come and Go , new ownership , an expansion . When i see bad reviews complaining how that new ownership is somehow responsible for a bad dining experience while specifically pining for the good old days under the previous owners The reviews are their first ones ever written , NOT EVEN a old review ,showcasing the Epic meals and service from days gone by, seem made up and possibly coached , just to cast dispersions against the present day owner .  In my opinion ,the new ownership, has taken an unprofessional, loud arguing , lack of pride in product , Restaurant and turned SW into the gem we enjoy today .  No one can get 5 stars at all times , but a one star from someone who loved the previous owners , without ever writing a single review expressing that love and how good \"their \" food was before it all changed, is suspect and does not add up .  Take the Pepsi challenge and you will find SW ready to serve you great food from authentic recipes , at a reasonable price ."}
{"text":"found this gem of a restaurant last week while exploring the southwest area of Vegas.  The staff was prompt, courteous, and helpful.  The food was outstanding, and the prices were very reasonable.  Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here after they expanded the restaurant. Food was out of this world! My son had Mac and Cheese and my wife and I had chicken Parmesan and Traditional Lasagna. By far the best Italian restaurant south of the strip. You have got to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Clever name, a take on the sub-genre of Western films, except with a \"y\" at the end. Possibly to sound more \"Americanized\", like they did when changing the spelling of the last names when immigrants arrived through Ellis Island. The menu pays homage to the old films with sandwiches named after them, like \"Hang 'Em High\" and the \"Magnificent Seven\".   Greeted at the door by Andrea, he immediatley started telling me all about the meats and cheeses in the deli case. A thick Italian accent, and a very enthusiastic sales pitch, we started talking about where he is from in Northern Italy, he went on to tell me all about his products in the store. The place is small, but they have a pretty extensive menu.    One of my favorite things in life is a charcuterie and a cheese board, complete with a glass of wine. I now have this in my neighborhood. Pretty large selection of imported Italian cheese as well as imported cold cuts like: speck, prosciutto crudo, soppressata, mortadella and your usual salami and pastrami. The cheese is what really peaked my interest, the gorgonzola was off the charts delicious. A strong bite, this is not your usual gorgonzola that we are used to. Fontina and Asiago rounded up my tasting.   They have an assortment of pastas, some made in house, some imported from Italy (they are frozen) as well as house favorites like eggplant parm and steak milanese. Also available are some housemade desserts (try the Tiramisu, it was fantastic) as well as imported Bindi Cakes. They do have beer and wine available as well. They offer seasonal specials, like rice arancini, which I will definitely come back to try. Andrea said they do cater, and they also offer cheese/cold cut trays.   This is a true Italian Deli, don't come in looking for a turkey sandwich and complain that they don't have it. It's not Subway. \"Whattsa matta you\"!"}
{"text":"Everything was alright wine was great ,clams were good the pasta is cooked to dine so that was just okay"}
{"text":"The Italian meatloaf is to die for!!!!! Great new owners and big thanks for the new soft chairs, my butt thanks you. Cheers"}
{"text":"Wonderful great tasting food no fancy flair JUST GREAT FOOD FRIENDLY SERVICE GOOD PRICES. VERY CLEAN you have to try their taramasue it is heaven. Durning our Waite the owner gave us samples of real Italian imported parachute ham and imported cheese everything is made fresh at the restaurant and you can taste the difference. You have to give this a try"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian deli foods!!!  Best soup ever...Minestrone alla Genovese soup!!!!!  Not your typical Las Vegas cookie cutter franchise food.  Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"We were traveling through Vegas looking for a good restaurant off the strip and discovered this place.  The service was excellent and consistent throughout the meal.  We ordered the prosciutto de Parma and they were very generous.  Their pasta dishes were freshly prepared, generously sized, and served hot.  They also had half portions that were perfect for our chikdren. Refreshing non chain restaurant with freshly prepared meals.  Highly recommend and will visit again next time through vegas. Specifically recommend the baked butternut squash ravioli."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been trying all the restaurants in this Southern Highlands plaza since we live right around the corner and let me tell you, this place along with the others we've tried did not disappoint! The place itself is small and had simple, deli shop style seating. My boyfriend had a craving for some carbonara and I ordered the shrimp fettuccine. All the ingredients are very fresh, unlike many of those chain italian restaurants,  and the portions are big! We also ordered the caprese appetizer and it was soooo good. Make sure you order some canolis for dessert too! Glad to find an authentic italian spot near by, coming back soon to try some of their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Don't let the size of this little gem fool you. It's a treasure! Tucked into a tiny location in a strip mall, it's not likely where you would expect to find a slice of authentic Italian heaven, but low and behold, here it is.   The people here are great and the food equally amazing. Very casual atmosphere great for a quick lunch, with a great deli for to go imports too!"}
{"text":"The spaghetti carbonara here was amazing. The calamari was soft and fresh. I love that they had reservations available here. My kids had spaghetti bolognese and they loved it. I loved the food so much I was going to order to go for my 6 hour drive home to Arizona. I will absolutely stop by here the next time I am in town! Yum!! Such a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but when I call and am told 35 minutes for pasta, something is wrong. When I show up and  wait an extra 20 minutes, I'm pissed. Very disorganized, very unprofessional on the phone,  not worth it at all. Save yourself the headache go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This location used to have so many different restaurants over the years that have gone out of business, I thought this would be another one. Went in there and had some of the best Italian food I've ever had in my life. Everyone is so nice. They make all their pasta fresh and you can buy their sauces too. The butternut squash raviolis might be one of the best things I've ever eaten! You need to eat here if you come to Vegas and want legit Italian food."}
{"text":"What a great little spot. I'm not a huge fan of Italian, however places like this make me love it!  I ordered the Chicken Alfredo. The noodles were prepared perfectly...you could tell they were fresh. The sauce was rich and buttery, very good.  The chicken was a little disappointing...tough. Not thinking this was because of the way it was cooked, but rather they maybe started with a lower quality chicken breast.  Fix that and I'd go 5 stars on this place!   Not a fan of the chairs, but that might just be me. I recommend trying the place."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and it has been very delicious every time.  However, I feel that it is a bit overpriced for what it is.  For example, one of my favorite dishes is a penne vodka dish with lots of garlic, sundried tomatoes, and prosciutto.  I've had this before, but this time when I got home and opened my to go order, there is absolutely no prosciutto.  So unless they've started blending it into the sauce, I feel like a veggie pasta for 14 bucks is a jip.  Taste good, but too expensive for me."}
{"text":"Cibo così buono che vi farà parlare Italiano!  PARKING  Ample parking here for this spot. A BUNCH!Located in the heart of Southern Highlands strip mall which has an abundance of other stores if you can't find parking then, it must be holiday time or Black Friday.....seems to ALWAYS be parking here.  THE EXPERIENCE   I walked in with my squad and we were immediately greeted by the owner. He made us feel welcomed and comfortable and sat us right away. The Chef and another employee were talking back in fourth ( in Italian ) while we were glancing at the menu....the owner comes over and tells us what they're discussing. Apparently the Chef got bored and made a pizza and calzone ( two items that are not on the menu but he wanted to see what it would cook like ), never made these items before and the owner suggested that he have us, my party be the first to try the deliciousness. We did not turn this offering down. We split the personal pizza and calzone and after a bite of each knew we had made the right decision in coming to Spaghetty Western. When deciding on appetizers we inquired about a few items that were not on the menu but certainly common dishes made in Italian spots. The bruschetta was one of the first requested items. When our waiter said they don't normally make that, but then said he may have some items in the back to accommodate us we were surely grateful.  [ I mean, it felt similar to an experience at an Italian friends home where their Mom is planted in the kitchen making meal after meal and as a guest you're forced to sit at the table and indulge on every last bit ]  My squad had never dined here before and we were just not used to the quality customer service that went above and beyond anything we'd ever experienced. Quality to a 'T' !!!  I had seen via Yelp of a certain dish that had Coke highly recommended when dining here, The Bobbi. Let me tell you it DID NOT disappoint. My beer was never empty and the complimentary bread basket always stayed full ( just like my belly ). An experience so good I did not want to leave Vegas.  The only thing left to discuss was the name of the location. We couldn't for the life of us figure out why such an authentic Italian restaurant had such ( what I thought to be ) a weak name. The owner then explained that the name was inherited by the previous owner and actually was the general name for many of the Westerns that were shot in the early 1940's and 50's. Majority of the locations for these films were in Italy. Actors like John Wayne & Clint Eastwood were filmed in these historic towns in southern Italy. Hence the name Spaghetty Western.  OVERALL  The experience increased in quality as the meal progressed. The staff, extremely personable and helpful in every way. Looking forward to the renovations that will be happening over the next couple months, an expansion of the restaurant including a bar and patio area will be full equipped by mid-April. Don't fret though, all you locals will still be able to enjoy the food, they'll be open during this enhancement period.  Spaghetty Western, benvenuto nel club a 5 stelle!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this gem in Southern Highlands after reviewing the yummy menu. My gauge for a great Italian place is to try the Calamari, Chicken Piccata and Tiramisu. I found this place to be quaint and cozy for locals. Service was a bit slow but adequate. We order the calamari which looked good but undercooked and chewy. The chicken piccata left much to be desired. The chicken was tough and the sauce was bland. The addition of red pepper flakes couldn't help this dish. The tiramisu tasted frozen and thawed. My piece came with a small plastic wrapper in the dessert which was a huge turn off. I'm not sure if I'd give this place another try but maybe I'll check out the deli if I'm down that way again."}
{"text":"I've lived everywhere that is home to the best Italian. New York. New Jersey. Chicago. I've been to Italy. This is LEGIT. the best Italian I've had. Delicious. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. My boys love the pizza. I love everything. I can't wait to get back there for our thrice yearly Vegas trips. Do not miss out on this out of the way joint. It's the best!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. There were 2 servers for the entire restaurant with more than 4 men bussing. Waited too long to be offered a glass of wine and order dinner. My lasagna sauce tasted like Chef boy ardee and the Tira Misu was served in a tiny plastic cup. The dinning experience was one I never wish to experience again. Loud and not intimate at all. When I say intimate I mean I could not hear myself or my dinning mate talk. Server paid more attention to his friends than us. As if we were irrelevant. If I pay 20 or more per person I want to be served and paid attention to. At least act like you care about your customers. Even if we aren't your friends. Never going back."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  We came at 2pm and the place was not crowded, as expected.  I was hesitant to come here before because of the name.  It didn't sound like an appealing Italian restaurant.  But I've had a couple of people tell me that it was good so I decided to try.  The food was very good and the service was great.  Will definitely come back again and recommend to other people!"}
{"text":"Last night we came home from our business and forgot to take out our protein from the freezer.  We decided to go for a quick bite around the corner to Spaghetty Western.   We were greeted by smell of deliciousness right when we walked in and by very nice and friendly gentleman named Robert.   We told him it's our first time eating here he found a table for us immediately which was a pleasant surprise because the rest of the tables and bar were full.     The first thing we noticed was really good prices on bottle of wine.  The menu was large and had lots of classics and specials.   Debbie our server was engaging and knowledgeable.   The house bread and oil, herb with garlic dipping con concoction was devilishly good I wanted to drink it from the gravy bowl but didn't want to get thrown out for being an animal so i ordered more bread to make sure I got every drop.    We orders a great house salad loaded with antipasto tidbits.  Since I'm no longer drinking my wife had a nice glass of wine instead of the bottle but we I'll be back with friends to take advance of bottle pricing.    My wife can never order her past how she likes it.  She was giddy with the ability to create her own!  I mean she usually gets shunned and embarrassed ordering a mix penne, bolognese, veggies (Bootlegger was the worst at shaming her) Debbie loved the order and it came out exactly how she wanted.  Wow!!  Win for our family.   I had went with Debbie (well I should have done the daily special Osobuco it LOOKED incredible) instead I did a white sauce with a pasta I've never seen so good, Italian sausage (light and airy), asparagus and other veggies.  I mopped this up like I hadn't eaten before I normally wouldn't have ordered this so glad I did.    We had to try desert the home made tiramisu and gelato where perfectly yummy.      We found a new favorite local eatery in Southern Highlands highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here a few time during lunch time but their service is superb! Their lunch menu and prices are absolutely worth coming back for as well. I love their Pink Vodka sauce! Everyone is so attentive and anticipatory and quick. Everyone should try them out."}
{"text":"This is my third time here, and I must say they have a delicious Antipasto salad. The meats and cheeses are imported.   Yelp insists I write more bit my food is here already, so thanks for taking the time to read this."}
{"text":"Once again we came and had a great dinner and deserts.. Celebrating mom's birthday with 17 in our party, Alex and the whole crew came threw with flying colors! Great food drinks and awesome deserts!  If you have not tried this place for lunch or dinner your missing out !!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome environment! Super place for lunches, dinner or when you just don't want to cook; can get it delivered too! Yum!"}
{"text":"They had lunch special with drink, soup or salad and entree for $10.95.  It was very good and big servings on everything. I had baked ziti and ceasar salad while hubby had the spaghetti with meatballs (gigantic) and tortellini spinach soup. They also gave us bread with pesto dipping sauce while food is getting prepped. I'd love to come back.  Scrumptious lunch happy tummythanks Robert."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the best Italian food in Las Vegas!  The food is always fabulous and the ownership, management and staff are all very friendly and accommodating.  I highly recommend you try this neighborhood restaurant, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just wonderful! Service was friendly, fast and pleasant. Food was top notch! We ordered chicken piccata , lobster ravioli and shrimp Alfredo. The piccata was excellent ! Just the right amount of acid and very flavorful. The lobster ravioli was sooooo good! You can see the real lumps of lobster in the ravioli. The pink sauce that comes with it was great also. Shrimp Alfredo was creamy, not heavy and cooked to perfection.  I will be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"It' really doesn't pay to advertise if you  can not make customers happy ! Ordered a sausage pizza , cold and burnt, maybe 6 pieces of sausage , never again !"}
{"text":"After being longtime customers, sadly I don't think we will be coming back. After their expansion the prices have gone up considerably (over 20%, I know bc I checked the two take out menus I still had at home) and it has lost the charm that it had as a small family restaurant. Sure, the inside looks fantastic and it has a bar now. But part of the appeal before was that you felt like you were getting excellent food at a great price in an intimate setting. The food was just so so. A few parts of our order (substitute penne for angel hair, white sauce instead of red) were wrong.  Aside from that I suppose there are some new investors now because I keep seeing an older gentleman there who makes his presence known and greeted a few tables. He was wearing flip flops - unless I'm at a beach shack, I think this is highly inappropriate. And he's very obnoxious - asked us how our food was literally seconds after it was sat in front of us and nobody had even taken a bite yet. We watched him block the main walking area when paying customers were trying to get through. We also heard him complaining about a staff member being late - keep that kind of comment away from the customers."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch. What a great little neighborhood spot. I ordered a small house salad and chicken soup, and oh boy, their portions... my mouth dropped (see my photos). The salad was packed with fresh tomatoes, sun dried bell peppers, sun dried tomatoes, olives, red onions, artichoke, fresh mozzarella and pepperocini on spring mix lettuce and spinach. The standard salad dressing is Italian. Their chicken soup was also large in portion served with mini pasta shells, mall pieces of chicken, carrots and celery. I really liked that the soup was not too salty. I hate when restaraunts get salt happy and often times chicken soups come out very salty. If you think it's too bland, you have the option of adding more salt and pepper. Each dish comes with a half toasted garlic bread. As the main dish (I didn't know I was going to have so much food), I had the lunch size Vodka pink pasta with penne. The penne was cooked perfectly. Not too overcooked or undercooked, al dente just the way I like it. The sauce was thick and creamy and flavor was good. Lastly, I ordered a butternut squash ravioli in 4 cheese with panchetta and mushrooms as recommended by one of the employees. It also did not disappoint. The price is very reasonable especially considering their portions. I'd definitely come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out this restaurant after someone recommended it to me. So glad we did! We went earlier about 5ish it wasn't too busy. Cute restaurant.... Loved the music they had playing. It was three of us so we decided to start off with the Caesar salad (which is enough to share). One of the best Caesar salads I've had in awhile. For an Appetizer we had the Calamari... Another hit!!! I liked that it came with three lightly breaded shrimps as well.... Thanks! Me and my mom shared the chicken piccata. Ok....so I must say I'm extremely hard to please with chicken piccata. Mostly because most places have zero clue on how to make it. I can honestly say this is one of the best chicken piccata's I've ever had. My aunt had the shrimp scampi with linguine in red sauce. She loved it as well. I'll definitely be back soon. So glad we found this gem :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant exceeds expectations! The food is amazing and the service is even better! Such a great location my husband and I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service for such a small place but well  worth it! I will be back! Thanks Joe!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place but it's slowly going down hill. Perhaps they are just getting too greedy. I ordered my go-to, a meatball sandwich, the other night with extra sauce on the side. I noticed that the total was more than usual and when I looked at the check I saw they charged $2 for an extra side of sauce that they didn't even bother to put in the bag. When I returned to request the sauce that I had paid for, the gave me a very very small container. When I made a comment about the size the lady lied and said they also added extra sauce to the actual sandwich, which they did not. I understand policies change but at the very least the person taking my order could have let me know about the price increase. Its only $2 but that's not the point. It's just disappointing when perfectly good restaurants stop caring about customer satisfaction and begins worrying more about the bottom line. If they are so worried about making a few extra bucks on some sauce, it makes me concerned that perhaps they are also cutting corners with the quality of ingredients in their kitchen."}
{"text":"The food and service is excellent! Marinara sauce is made fresh daily and if you don't eat meat or cheese they make a pasta with olive oil dressing that is  stupefacente!"}
{"text":"Great service, opens at 11am and we arrived at 10:30am Alex was nice enough to open up for us. Food spoke for itself, fresh ingredients and well prepared. Staff was knowledgeable of menu. 10/10 service. First time here, Tried the chicken paillard and it was great. We Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars to this place, I would. The food is HANDS DOWN the best Italian I have had in my entire life."}
{"text":"First, to address the negative comments about the female server: people have bad days and some can't handle stress as well as others. At times she seemed distracted, but she has little help with a full dining room. To add to this: most regulars seemed to expect her to drop everything and help them. Be patient, people...and lighten up! She knew all of the regulars and knew what they ordered in the past. That's not easy to keep track of! She was awesome with our 3 year old, knew the menu and was able to make awesome suggestions for us. BONUS. The food was amazing. We had the antipasto plate...the meats were incredible and I'm a prosciutto SNOB! We also ordered entrees (5 of us total)...there were NO complaints. There was enough food for each of us to take home and enjoy again for lunch the next day.  If you are a gnocchi fan, I highly recommend it! I had it with pink vodka sauce and it was de-lish.  The thing I really didn't like about this place was the marks the chair left on my legs. The seating is not comfy - it is more for deli-seating...in and out. If you want to relax and have a drink with dinner, you may want to take the food to go. If they had different chairs, non-wicker type, 5 stars for sure.  This is a 5-star to go place!!"}
{"text":"Delicious pasta! I had the classic marinara and it was amazing! I called in a to go order and it was ready as soon as we got there! I just moved to this area and I'm so glad that I found a reasonably priced delicious pasta place! So glad we decided to check it out!"}
{"text":"Best service and Italian food in town!  It's my go-to for delivery (via postmates) when I can't get there in person or don't feel like cooking.  Big thumbs up"}
{"text":"Drove into parking lot to go somewhere else - saw the sign and decided to try it.  Ordered Spinach Ravioli w/ pesto and a Prosciutto Mozzarella sandwich.  Both were excellent and this place is worth going to. They are growing and expanding to 1200 more Sq. Ft and from what was told will have a bar... cant wait.   Grazie di cuore Spaghetti Western!"}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere, very traditional dishes with consistent flavors. Great option for Italian."}
{"text":"I do not feel this place is worth their menu prices. It's about $8 for a kids meal that does not include anything but the entree. Not even a drink for kids. The pasta pomodora was literally noodles with canned tomato soup mixed In the noodles. Whatever ever my husband got he just ate the meat and left the rest of the noodles bc it was bland. My daughters kids mac and cheese was boring. She didn't eat it. The service was great though."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite the food is made fresh the deserts are made homemade and the people are amazing . Like a neighborhood treasure for sure  if you don't eat here forget about eating . You have to try the chicken parm and the calamari is amazing seriously the best we have had and we love calamari ."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Pricey for the location and ambience. Nothing extraordinary at all. For our family of four, 2 adults and 2 toddlers, with no alcohol, our bill was about $100 for dinner. That's a bit excessive for what it is. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We love this place especially after the remodel. Great food, a bit pricey, but worth it since it's also close by. They also allow you to bring in your own bottle of wine which is great!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years.   Had a little dip in service and consistency a few times, but we got a chance to try it again tonight and had an excellent meal and even better service.  Alex is and always has been a staple of quality at this restaurant, tonight we had Alex and another younger gentleman; both amazing service.    Food was exceptional tonight.   Had the bruschetta and it seems to have been redone from what we had before.  Really tasty, perfectly made, excellent Balsamic Glaze and topped off with a few really great olives.  Very much enjoyed.    We had the lobster Ravioli, came with a great blush sauce and a few perfectly cooked mini shrimp.  Very good!     My younger children shared spaghetti and meatballs, and the sauce and the meatballs were the star here!     Finally my wife and I split Chicken Francese and the Chicken Park with Fettuccine Alfredo.   I loved the Parm and the Alfredo and my wife loved the Francese, so it was a win-win.        The best part here is the new owner; he really cares about what customers think.  It is obvious in the fact that he is at the restaurant on a Friday night, greeting the guests and hanging at the bar making friends.        I have had a roller coaster ride here from loving, to disappointment, to loving again.  I imagine that if the owner is this attentive they can only have tremendous success.     -Bravo"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I hadn't found a decent Italian restaurant under $25 a plate until now.  I will bring my family here when they come to town!  The calamari appetizer was tasty, as was my baked ziti.  And the coffee/americano was perfect.  If I wasn't across the valley I would be here more often.  Thinking of going to Summerlin??"}
{"text":"this place was amazing the penne pasta was so delishhh and the custard flan was good to very unique im defiantly coming back! the ambience was great the place had old picture frames of movies i love it"}
{"text":"Amazing! My new favorite non sushi restaurant off the strip. I had the cheese sticks and shrimp scampi this afternoon. Will definitely be back soon. Very classy, great atmosphere and awesome staff. A+++"}
{"text":"Celebrated my friend's birthday and had a treat! Robert, one of the owners, made us feel at home and helped us select the perfect dishes. We loved the appetizer house mushrooms, the pizza and the spaghetti Bolognese.  The Italian custard just melted in my mouth. Dishes were big portions. Good for family style eating."}
{"text":"We were immediately greeted the moment we stepped foot into this delightful restaurant. Their menu is extensive and I wanted to order everything on it and in time I will! First I must acknowledge  the friendliness and willingness of the staff and management. It was an absolute pleasure to dine here and though this was our first time here we felt so comfortable and appreciated (so rare these days!)  Now the really good stuff...we ordered the antipasto misto. You choose 3 meats and 2 cheeses from a great selection imported from Italy  (their mozzarella is homemade and is excellent too!) The antipasto arrived on a huge platter with our selection plus peppers, artichokes, variety of olives, sundried tomatoes all on a bed of greens. This was one of the best antipasto platters I ever had and the portion is generous so there is plenty to go around and the quality of this antipasto was outstanding. My husband ordered spaghetti and meatballs which he said was delicious and served piping hot....the sauce was excellent and the meatballs were too. I had the gnocchi in meat sauce also served piping hot and was excellent too. We shared a dessert but for the life of me I cannot remember the name of but it was a cross between mousse and ice cream and it disappeared from our plate in seconds YUM!! Our waitress was very nice and pleasant  and she knew the menu well. Our drinks were always filled without having to ask and she checked on us frequently. I really liked after we were finished eating and needed to go containers she took our plates and came back with everything packaged nicely for us. Most places just give you the containers and you have to juggle this yourself so this was a nice surprise. So I hope I have convinced you to give this place a try. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week.  The food is fresh, natural, and always delicious!  SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Amazing people amazing crowd always a great servers, bartenders, and cooks. Food and specials are always top notch. Come here for dinner with family or date night or just when want a great time. Bartender makes great drinks and is great for talking."}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night. Happy hour, pasta, meatballs, salad,and desert. Two for one cocktails were great at the bar only. Salad was excellent. Meatballs, and pasta were OK. Spoumoni was nothing what I was used to. I think it was left over tiramisu ingredients. Service and ambience was great . When you've been raised on homemade Italian food , nothing matches up to it."}
{"text":"Update: new management! Newly renovated and great. Came for lunch but will be back for dinner. We loved our server Dario. Handsome and efficient. So happy to have such a cozy and warm place to enjoy authentic Italian food. Yum yum yum.     We have been coming here for a few months and always loved the food. They have cut the portions in half and kept the high prices. We didn't mind paying $18 for a meatball sandwich when the meatballs were large and homemade, now they are prepared by someone else and a fraction of the original size. I don't think we will be back. The waitresses are always nice so I gave them 2 stars."}
{"text":"My husband brought home a doggy bag from a business lunch. Of course I heated it up later that evening for a snack. I loved the Baked Ziti!  Our next date night started with this cozy restaurant and bar.  I had the baked ziti / salad and my husband had the spaghetti and meatballs / flavorful veggies and for dessert the Tiramisu.  Great food! Great staff! Great Vibe! The owner came by our table to make sure everything was well. As we chatted I felt as if we knew Dave for a long time.  We will definitely be back with the whole family next time.   When your in the mood for delicious Italian give Spaghetty Western a try. The name doesn't do this restaurant justice."}
{"text":"We have both been here and has take out (they deliver)....and both times it has been great. I'm not fond of the pizza but the pasta and salads are awesome. Definitely fills your Italian fox when you don't feel like cooking"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!!! - My first time ordering from this restaurant was on a very lazy and  hungry day where I wanted food delivered to me.  This showed up on Yelp for delivery services. Took a peek at some pictures and decided to order the Chicken Parmesan with pasta and the Linguini Fisherman. The gentleman who took my order had decent customer service and the food was delivered to my house within 30 mins.   After tasting both dishes, I honestly thought what I ordered was just ok. Didn't hit the spot but it helped the empty stomach I had and probably would of kept me full for the rest of the day.   A couple of hours later my stomach started cramping severely and out came the vomit and well.. everything else that comes with the territory.   This was the first time in my life where I've EVER had this happen to me. My GF came helping me after her finding me in fetal position on my bathroom floor. I didn't know wether if I should of went to the hospital or if I should just ride it out. I decided to ride it out and save myself from unwanted expensive hospital bills. I pretty much was stuck in my bathroom the remaining night. I would NEVER write a bad review unless it was necessary. This is a SERIOUS incident that left me crying and in A LOT of pain.  I wanted to see if anyone had the same incident to help me decide wether I should say anything about the food. So I started going through the reviews and saw that there were a few who have WITNESSED many health code violations in person. There was one review stating where the cook touched raw chicken and continued to touch pots and pans. Another incident where they saw the cook running his fingers through his hair numerous times and then touched bread with his bare hands. One where a cook stuck his fingers in his mouth to grab food from his teeth and Whattada know.. One review where the SAME dish was ordered and left a woman in the emergency room for FOOD POISONING! Is this the same cook or are all of them unsanitary?!!  The fact that these people have seen these things in person doesn't surprise me that whoever prepared my meal would be completely careless and unsanitary to food that are being delivered to homes (people) away from eyes witnessing it first hand.   I WILL NEVER SUGGEST NOR COME BACK TO THIS PLACE EVER AGAIN. And I truly feel sad that this is located in a nice area like Southern Highlands. Major disappointment.Please be careful if you eat here. You never know what else goes on in the kitchen and if you could be the next person to go through this."}
{"text":"Great service, owners are always working here. Everyone is very friendly. The food is very good especially the meatballs and pizza."}
{"text":"So yummy! The lasagna is amazing and the desserts are to die for. I work at the salon a few doors down and I have to stop myself from having pasta too often lol but I love this place!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, you can taste the honesty and love that goes into this food ! Nice portions, great sauce, perfectly cooked pasta,  menu to please anyone, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I brought my mom and dad here for a late Saturday lunch.  I wish I could comment on the food but it was late December and they didn't have the heat on despite everyone in the restaurant having their coats on.  Being pregnant and hungry for pizza, my family decided to stick it out and stay there to eat with me since there are few options nearby.  I tried to ask or server and manager multiple times if they could turn the heat up, to which they replied, it takes a while.  The place didn't get one degree warmer the entire time my family ate there.  I couldn't even tell you how the food was that day.  We had a female bartender acting as our server and she couldn't seem to get anything to our table in a reasonable amount of time.  All around horrible experience.  There is nothing worst then eating while freezing, especially when the food is not cheap.  It should have been a nice family experience but we won't be back.  I'll go next door where they turn the heat on from now on."}
{"text":"We were planning to have a very late breakfast at Rise and Shine almost next door, but it was very busy with a long wait.  We were hungry and everyone said okay to trying Italian food instead.    Our table had:  Pasta with an alfredo and vegetables Manicotti Italian sandwich can't remember the 4th dish.  Let's just say that the Manicotti was wonderful.  Hand made pasta and the cheese/spinach stuffing was great with their meat sauce.  The Italian sandwich was just what we had been looking for around town.  Everywhere we went we were  disappointed, but here it is fabulous.  The flavor explodes in your mouth.  We will be back even though it is not close to our home.  A 20 minute drive.  The alfredo pasta with vegetables was also given a high thumbs up from my friend.  We all ate our leftovers that night because they were so good.  Yey :)"}
{"text":"My family is addicted to this place. We love the spaghetti and meatballs and the alfredo. The service is great and the place has a great atmosphere. I give it four stars instead of five simply because I feel it is a tad pricey   for 1 adult spaghetti & meatball (+ 1 extra meatball) entree and 1 shrimp fettuccini alfredo was $37 for takeout, felt a tad high for 2 entrees but not out of line by any means   I will be back many times as it is still really good and such a great location by the house.  definitely worth it"}
{"text":"I actually can't believe the experience I had here tonight.  We ordered a bottle of wine, kids lemonade, five waters. They forgot lemonade....so 20 min in, we ask for it again.  We got the bread and it tasted like burned plastic. Just like the smell coming from the kitchen.....huh?  We ordered two salads and four entrées...and wait and wait. The restaurant was at 35 percent capacity...not busy. They brought out our entrées and I said can you please tell us where our salads are...waiter said what do you mean? I said we have not received them. He said....so you want me to cancel them now? I said yes please...  We ordered the spaghetti and meatballs (excellent), penne Bobbi (excellent) and lobster shrimp ravioli (ok but they used canned shrimp). These 3 items are only reason I'm giving 2 stars.   When my daughter got her cheese pizza she took one bite and whispered mom this is horrible! I thought she was being a picky kid... until I tried it...tasted like burnt plastic! Just like the bread.  We told the waiter about the bread tasting burnt who said \"we have a know-it-all-chef so I will tell him but it won't do any good.\" Whaaaaaattt? I asked him to please tell chef and try the dough so they don't serve it to anyone else. He came back and said the chef is using a different broiler oven because our pizza oven is broke and we didn't see any plastic in it. I asked if he tried the bread...he said no. Wtf?!  My father said one check and to give him the bill...waiter hands the check to my husband. Grrrrr  Seriously bummed out. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I just ordered \"the Bobbi\" because it's one of their popular dishes. The prosciutto was terrible. You couldn't even barely bite into because it was so tough and chewy. The sauce was salty. If it wasn't salty, you can tell the sauce would be tasty. I paid $15 pretty much wasted. The lady at the counter was nice though."}
{"text":"My baby love as per usual found this hidden gem, away from the strip, on our vacation to vegas, the food was delicious and well served plentiful, budget friendly, the atmosphere was great the music playlist for the day was great! The service was great. I loved it."}
{"text":"First timers today and so happy with the outcome. Bruschetta, chicken soup, chicken parmigiana, tiramisu! Everything was fresh and delicious! Thanks to Derek for the awesome service."}
{"text":"Great food! Portions are great. They give you complimentary bread with your meal or you can get garlic bread for $3.99. The place is pretty big and a little dim but that's not bad. The service of the staff is great and friendly.   We had in our group. Calamari, vodka pasta, three meatball spaghetti, speck pasta with fettuccine (I added Chicken but it's better without the chicken!!) chicken parmigiana sandwich, pesto creamy with chicken & two build your own pizza which was pepperoni and sausage. I really like the pizza here. The dough was delish. The pasta of course was also delish. I was thinking that the vodka pasta would be not good but it was actually great.  I wasn't fond of the bread that came with the pasta. It's ok.   Shared parking with other stores and restaurants. It's in a big huge plaza."}
{"text":"Our favorite Italian Restaurant in all of Vegas! Great authentic food, Awesome service, wonderful drinks!  This place always \"Makes My Day!\" pun intended.. Alex is our always waiter. Very attentive to serving customers, great with menu selections... This place is a \"must go\" and we bring visitors to town for the great food !!!"}
{"text":"My last review was great but unfortunately this one isn't. My grandson wanted to go here for his 18th birthday for their whole Maine lobster so I called them to see if they were going to have the lobster on that day.  I was told \"we can have it anytime as long as you let me know ahead of time\". So great, I told him we'll be there in two days.  When we did go we ordered the lobster and the waiter said we don't have lobster tonight so I said please ask the chef because I was assured we would have the lobster. He returned and said no I'm sorry we don't have any. Ok so let's move on. Grandson got veal Parmesan, husband got meatball sub and I ordered chicken Marsala. Veal was really good meatball sub was so so. Sauce was not on sub was on the side and meat balls was just ok. I asked for linguini with my chicken Marsala and I got angel hair. Sent it back and came back with linguini but I asked where's the Marsala sauce? I was told that's how we make it. Two small pieces fried chicken, no sauce. This was an unfortunate 18th birthday."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing.  Food was delicious. The place looks great after renovations. I love this place and soo close to home. Portions are nice and the price is right. Great gem in Southern Highlands."}
{"text":"Staff are very welcoming and the service is excellent, attentive and appropriate. The house salad is fresh and imaginative compared with other restaurants. Chicken marsala was comparable with a cafe in a good locals casino, albeit served fresh and piping hot from the kitchen which the cafes often struggle to do. Tasty but priced higher than I would've expected. The pizza, however, was very disappointing. The texture of the crust was excellent, crisp and bubbly, but it lacked taste. The sauce was very basic and the cheese unimpressive. There are plenty of better options for pizza across the city, many of which are excellent. Overall, the food does not do justice to the quality of the staff working there."}
{"text":"Came here last week for the first time, I ordered the lobster ravioli, my boyfriend ordered the Diovola. Both were AMAZING. I will order the Diovola next time though because I liked that a little more. The sauce on it is perfect. The lobster ravioli was super yummy with the shrimp. Our server ( bald guy with glasses) was AWESOME! Loved him  It's a far drive for me but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is why you go to local restaurants!!  Chef Owner Ninni is from Palermo and serves traditional Italian dishes with love.  Whatever you do try this diamond in the rough!!  The linguini with shrimp was amazing and seafood linguini was great!!"}
{"text":"Fun name. Apt touches of western sub-genre film posters. Warm colors and wood paneling evoke a modern saloon feel -- you'd halfway expect a space cowboy to walk in, but then you remember you're nestled in a shopping plaza in the heart of Southern Highlands.  More often than not, my bf and I venture out to new places with the practicality of a Groupon. This was one of those days. I bought a $20 lunch voucher for about half the price, then just paid the difference. We visited at the tail-end of lunchtime, so the place was practically empty.   Our server was great. He started us off with drinks and appetizers. We decided on a plate of their FETTUNTA, a 5-piece garlic bread with olive oil and a side of marinara. Reminded me of Texas toast, but with herbs. I got the PASTA PESTO made with FETTUCINE. I had the choice of plain or creamy, so I went with creamy -- good choice. My bf kept it simple and got the SPAGHETTY MEATBALLS, with 3 large house made meatballs included.   Their pasta selection can be overwhelming. There's a section of CLASSIC, which offers your choice of pasta: spaghetti, penne, linguine, fettucine, capelli; for $2 more: gnocchi, pappardelle, cavatelli; for $3 more: cheese tortellini, mushroom or lobster or butternut squash ravioli. Then they have more items under PASTA SPECIALS as well as under PASTA DI MADRE. So safe to say, there's no shortage of pasta here. Price ranges from $12.95 - $24.95. Hellooo carbs!  Overall, we had an enjoyable lunch. I had read some of the reviews on here and was a little hesitant to try because of the unprofessional responses that could have been dealt with better, but we didn't encounter anything like that. Grab the Groupon!"}
{"text":"Went there finally last night. Had stopped in once before when they renovated and purchased Cannolis, which are amazing. Had the bruschetta and fried squid. Bruschetta was just as you'd expect and the squid was very tender and had a great seasoning to it.  Next I had the Spaghetti Carbonara and pretty much cleared the plate. Our table spilt a few desserts and while they were all good, the tiramisu was amazing. The tiramisu was fresh, moist and the espresso or coffee powder in it was amazing!  Great place and service was quick and on top of us and our drinks.  Will be back.  Nice to have good places like that in our southwest side of town."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Heavy prices for small portions. The meat lasagna filled about half of the to go container. The fettuccine Alfredo- noodles were stiff and under cooked and also very small. $28 not very well sent. The shrimp Alfredo contained 5 shrimp with the tails still on and the chicken piccata was advertised to have mushrooms, but whatever it was sure was smaller than peas. The shrimp Alfredo and piccata was a whopping $34. Again small portions.    Definitely doesn't match up to Rosati's"}
{"text":"Ate lunch again here since it's close to my house.  Used groupon.  Saved some $.  Got the fettuccine bolognese and although it was decent, it was nothing great.  Bootlegger on Las Vegas BLVD is way better.     My dish was luke warm and i only live 5 mins away.  The flavors were ok and the portion size was good.    People are nice there n they have done a good renovation of the restaurant.   I will probably go back but only with groupon."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Italian! The lobster ravioli and tiramisu are must haves!!!! Service is awesome"}
{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant since they first opened their door (almost 2 yrs now).  Nice to have a family owned, authentic restaurant right in our neighborhood.  Just great food and friendly atmosphere.  We tried almost everything in the menu but our favorite is the cioppino.  We enjoyed it so much that we requested to have a large portion in their menu.  I recommend Primitivo wine to go with it.  We've taken our friends, families and neighbors to this restaurant and all gave great ratings.  If you live across town, it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to this place because it was so good! Cute little restaurant decorated with a western/cowboy feel (hence the name). My girlfriend and I came here around lunch time. The service was great and the workers/owners here are so nice.  They offer a lunch deal where it comes with soup or salad and a main dish for $11.99 I believe. My friend ordered the lunch special with caesar salad and pink vodka sauce with angel hair noodles and I ordered cacio e pepe with spaghetti noodles. They gave us complimentary bread with seasoned olive oil as a starter. We shared her caesar salad because it was a full size, and it was good! We got our pasta shortly after. I loved both of them. The cacio e pepe was so buttery, cheesy, and simply seasoned with fresh black pepper. Simple and good. I really loved the pink vodka sauce here, it was delicious with the angel hair. It was creamy and so flavorful, I will probably order it the next time I go.  The lunch special was a good deal. The portions were large enough for us to take some home."}
{"text":"If you don't like authentic Italian food then skip this place, because they make the most amazing real Italian food. Been there a couple times, haven't food something on the menu I didn't love."}
{"text":"Food overpriced. Horrible service and we didn't even eat there. Guy was on his cell phone while helping us and extremely rude."}
{"text":"Yay! I finally got  to eat the famous \"the Bobbie\". It was delicious ;-) I used to eat their food so often when they first opened this place. I used to get their delivery service like once a week. Since I live in the golf club, it was so convenient and fast delivery. I loved it. For some reason, they stopped the delivery service about a year ago, so I stopped eating their food. (Sorry I don't want to use Bite squad.) Today, I didn't want to drive far since it was Friday the 13th so I decided to eat at this place again. Well, I wanted to try \"the Bobbie\" for a while so it was a good thing. It was very nice and flavorful. Loved the strong garlic accent.  I would not drive 10 miles to come here and eat, but if you are in the area, you should try this place. Oh, about a year ago, they told me they were expanding the store since it's a tiny place... What happened to that??!! (Minus one star for no more delivery service. Minus one star for very limited seating.)"}
{"text":"We saw great reviews for this place so we decided to take a chance. This place has very few seats (10 tables if that). The hostess only wanted to seat us at the two seater that is right inside the door and up against another table. Awkward and uncomfortable anyone? We asked to sit at another table and she refused saying that they have upcoming reservations but only one table had a reserved sign on it. Since she refused to seat us we went next door to \"off the strip\" which was delicious. So thanks bitchy hostess girl. I hope those tables showed up."}
{"text":"Service is spotty, ordered and waited a long time. Got home and food was greasy, my husband had been before and loved the meatball sub so we thought it would be great.  I was so hoping it would be but I'm let down.  Will try again in a few months."}
{"text":"WOW!  Best Italian I've had in Las Vegas. Hand made fresh pasta, great sauces!  Super daily specials!  Doesn't get any better than this.   The chef maintains a great menu with lots of choices.   In addition, they have an Italian deli with high quality items imported directly from Italy."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been twice and everything is delicious. The homemade soups are yummy, spaghetti western from the few bites I stole was great but you cannot find a better antipasto in LV. Andrea is from Italy and has managed to bring the food and authentic experience to southern highlands. Bravo! Looking forward to next Sundays supper."}
{"text":"Worst and slowest service ever!! I ordered one simple dish to pick up and they told me 25-30 minutes. Ok so yeah places sometimes are a little slower than usual so I show up 35 minutes later. When I walk in I tell them I was there to pick up the order. \"Oh yeah it will be a couple of minutes more\" the hippie looking guy at the register said. 5 minutes later I see the cook barely putting the raw chicken on the pan and starting to cook it. Needless to say, my food wasn't ready until another 15 minutes and an argument with them over what was the point of me ordering ahead for take out?! I might as well have just gone there and ordered in person because they didn't start making the food until after I got there! Their excuse was that they're a family owned business and they're busy. Ummmm you have 2 tables with people at them and what does being a family owned business have anything to do with it?!??? That's not an excuse as far as I'm concerned. They couldn't have cared less and they just kept repeating that lame excuse. The only reason for the 2 stars is that their food was OK but service is everything and Spaghetty Western FAILS at that!!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch.  Chicken parm sandwich was tasty and the meatball sandwich was pretty good.  A bit slow to serve but everything is made fresh.  True Italian deli.    Next time I'm having the prosciutto for sure."}
{"text":"The food is always very good here.  However don't attend for holidays like Valentines.... quite the disaster... 1 waiter (Joe) for the entire dining area... Had a reservation for 6:00.... was not able to be seated until 6:25... We sat at the bar to have a drink and kill time... as soon as the bartender found out we were just having drinks and not food.... it was like we didn't exist.  We were seated in a favorite table (by chance)... Joe (waiter) came to see if we wanted drinks about 15 minutes after we were seated.... joe was not his normal happy self.... very short and stressed.  We ordered another round of drinks and apps..... The food is so good!!!!  Another 15 minutes apps came out and we ordered dinner... and some drinks.... apps were awesome... the chef and back of the house are always spot on.... front of the house not so good this night!  Way to busy for one person to handle, should have had a back up plan if someone called out sick??  We received dinner food is so good!!!  Dessert,  well we got it to go.... had more plans for the evening and with the slow service .... etc we didn't have time to enjoy... got home later that evening.... dessert was not what we ordered!  So food for thought, normally service is better then we received this evening.... the constant... is the food!  Back of the house carries this restaurant, so keep that in mind!  150.00 $ for 2 people plus tip... disappointing for the service we received this night!  Lloyd K. Henderson Locals"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Spaghetty Western.  Very friendly people!  Was greeted at the door by David who at that time I did not know he was the owner and had a chance to chat with him after our lunch and complimented him on the food.  I had the chicken marsala which was excellent!     Our waitress was also very nice when she greeted us and I would highly recommend anyone considering checking out this place.    On the way out, was very surprised with the generosity by David who gave my wife a complimentary tiramisu to take home.  Will definitely drop by again!"}
{"text":"This was our first time to this quaint, small intimate Italian restaurant. I have recently moved to  area and I have driven by a number of times and finally thought that we would come by and try it out for dinner. Am I ever glad that we did!!!  From the welcome we received at the door until the heartfelt goodbye when we left, the entire experience was absolutely excellent.   Our waiter, Clemente (sp?)was authentic and engaging. He made a wonderful dining experience even better. He really went over and above.   What can I say about the food - absolutely the best Italian I have had in Vegas. The sauces were superb. The tiramisu was sublime.   If I could offer one bit of constructive criticism (and I'm only doing this out of respect for their obvious expertise in the area) I think they could perhaps look at the \"wine situation\" as an area of possible improvement. Instead of only selling wine by the glass or bottle I would highly recommend that they adopt the method utilized by Batista's hole in the wall- that being that they offer a decent of house wine and utilize the small traditional \" tumbler\" style  wine glasses found in authentic Italian restaurants. Having the option to get a decanter of house wine would be a major addition to an already wonderful and authentic Italian experience.    I am not one to give high Yelp reviews. In fact, I have been accused of being very harsh . But, I have to give a A-  to A rating ( only the wine situation preventing it from being a solid A!)  This is now our \"go to Italian restaurant \"in Vegas.  Douglas Carle Carle Law Office"}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food! It tastes as good as the wonderful smells that envelope you as you walk in.   Our favorite place to sit is at the bar. Johnnie the bartender has such personality. She's witty, fun & makes you feel right at home. She looks like a younger version of Michelle Pfeiffer (think \"married to the mob\" without the bad clothes & accent ). She can handle making drinks for a full restaurant & bar all by herself and still manage to be friendly and personable.   Great food, drink & fun for locals!"}
{"text":"Went here at 3 pm on a Saturday afternoon and was told they are only taking to go orders when the dining room was empty. So we had to order for take out. They said 10 min, but it was more like 20+ min. So I guess come here only if you have a reservation. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the food is decent. It's not the best I've had, but better than Pizza Hut to go.   Edited to add: I dropped my review to 1 star. The portions are not your normal big sized pasta portions. My husband ordered the ravioli and my 20 month old was able to finish it all, and she's tiny (20 lbs) with a small appetite.  Don't plan on sharing your meal, even with a small child. I think the price you pay is not worth what you get."}
{"text":"Amazing food served with even better service! Love having this hidden gem of a restaurant in Southern Highlands.  Seats fill up fast especially on a weekend. I recommend a reservation"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in all of Vegas. I just wish it was closer to the strip because I would send all of my out-of-town friends here if I could, but it's a bit of a drive for people who fly in and don't have access to a car. My boyfriend and I can get an appetizer, two entrees and a dessert for less than $50. And the food is amazing. Our favorites are the mushroom appetizer (mushrooms and melted cheese on bread with a marinara dipping sauce) chicken piccata, chicken marsala, and the pasta carbonera. But you really can't go wrong with anything you get here."}
{"text":"Let me start with I have always loved this place since the first time I went about a year ago. My husband I went recently, and were pleasantly surprised with the amazing remodel. Now not only is the food and service to die for, but now the atmosphere matches! We sat at the bar, yes they have a bar now! My husband wasn't sure what he wanted, he couldn't decide between a few appetizers. So Pasquale, I believe an owner, made him a dish of 3 smaller appetizers, it was perfect! I also couldn't decide, so he made me a pasta with peas and it was to die for. This place goes above and beyond to make sure you have the best experience, and they are always so accommodating. Being from back east myself, this feels like \"home\" for me. From the food, to the wine, to the service, and the people, I see myself and my family dining here a lot. Even now more so due to the beautiful remodel. Thank you Spaghetti Western for being exactly what Southern Highlands needs!"}
{"text":"Wow what an amazing gem in Southern Highland! Our server, Heather, provided an excellent services.    We had meatballs and garlic bread for appetizer and SPEK, squash ravioli and Chicken Marsala for entree, and key lime cheese cake and tiramisu for dessert.   Everything is above expectations, especially for the tiramisu, the lady fingers soaked just perfectly, not too watery or too dry, the mascarpone & heavy cream and the coffee married very well. Must try item!!   Full bar in the restaurant and also a take out side for pick up. If you happen to order for a take out, you can also grab a yummy dessert prepackaged in the fridge!"}
{"text":"Authentic.  That says it all. Better than any Italian food I've had in town. When you order a meatball sandwich and it comes on freshly baked bread, slightly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside - that's special. Then the juicy meatballs melt in your mouth... Complete with melted cheese and just the right amount of marinara. I ate it all. Very nice atmosphere - cozy but also very sophisticated. The owner came over to see if we were enjoying the meal, and just couldn't stop being impressed. I would highly recommend this restaurant. It's unique for Las Vegas. Off the beaten path, and well worth the adventure."}
{"text":"Nice place with a local feel.  Had Caesar salad, Veal Marsala and Key Lime cheesecake.  Everything was very good.  Wait staff is very attentive and I didn't have to wait long for anything.  Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"This local restaurant has Incredible, Amazing Italian food and the owners are straight from Palermo, Sicily. Chef Ninni offers warmth and Sicilian flare. Definitely a Great place to visit and very reasonable prices"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area almost two years and do not know why I had not tried this place before now.  Excellent service by Dario and the food was fresh with amazing flavor. Gourmet cocktails and a good atmosphere. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"If you haven't been go! Dine in with Alex and his fantastic customer service while sipping a glass of wine, take out, they even deliver!!! The Calabrese sandwich is a must try, the caprese northern is very fresh and generous in size. The absolute best homemade tiramisu iv had! Once we started going we haven't stopped, ordering our trying new things each time!"}
{"text":"When it comes to Italian food I am hard to impress. Actually when it comes to any food I'm hard to impress...anyways...I LOVVVVE Spaghetty Western. I have dined in, taken out and used the delivery service. I stopped with deliveries and now just call an order in and pick it up because every single time we would order a delivery we had an issue. Two hour wait times, wrong items delivered etc. the worst was the wait. Every single time. The food is well worth leaving the couch. I don't think I've ate one bad thing here. The pastas, pizza, sandwiches, salads, cheese and meat platters are all so amazing. The Penne Pink Vodka is to die for and the portions are all worth the money you spend on them. Everything is shareable too. If you like Italian food you MUST check this place out, you won't be disappointed (unless you order delivery ;))."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Vegas! Hands down! Love the waiters there, always pleasant and friendly. Highly recommended, great family restaurant"}
{"text":"Today, we decided to stop in for a quick lunch. My wife loves the lasagna and I chose to order the lunch special. Portions on the lunch special were not altered to scale down size. I could not finish my meal because it was very filling. The food was excellent! The service by Robert Proby was only matched by our last visit when Johnny waited on our table. Robert was very attentive and right on top of our needs.  I spoke to the owner upon exiting and discovered we were raised near each other on the East Coast. This place is just like going home without the long flight.  I would highly recommend this establishment and encourage others to try them out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is fantastic every time. Johnie is a fantastic bartender and is always friendly and providing great service and quality conversation.   Try the piccata, it will change your life!"}
{"text":"One day I had an extreme craving for pasta. Not the standard tomato sauce pasta that feels like it was pointed out of a can but in house made sauce that you know was made fresh. After doing much poking on yelp I came across this restaurant.   We came in right as it opened and decided to sit at the bar. I love the feel that it has of catering to locals. Kind of feels like a place that accumulates regulars and has it's own homey feel.   Ordered the prosciutto and mozarella starter, garlic bread (it's a few dollars extra compared to their regular complimentary break) because you have to have that while you eat pasta, and a pasta entree.   The bartender was awesome and super nice. The reason I say pasta entree is because I told him that I wanted him to chose what sauce and which pasta middles we got based on what he liked. It was BOMB. He said that the noodles were made fresh in house and it was definitely cooked perfectly. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This very small hole in the wall has very authentic Italian dishes. The staff seems like family or friends of family. The dinning area seats maybe 20. This may all seem limiting. Well the flavors were not limited.  I had gnocchi with speck mushrooms Ina pink sauce. The pasta was homemade and spot on. The texture was the perfect blend of structure but soft to the chew. The speck had a great salty ham/bacon taste to bring the savory side of the dish out while the pink sauce was very rich with cream and a hint of sweet.  My wife had spaghetti and meat sauce. The sauce was plentiful and there was no shortage of meat in her dish. The pasta was also fresh and a perfect al dente.  We finished with two desserts. A cannoli and crostata.  Great overall experience. Just need some help with the space and organization."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been going since before they expanded. I believe it's family owned. Hands down the best Italian food I've had in LV. The staff is welcoming, the food is always good and homemade that day, you will overeat when you go. Try everything just because. I will say I thought the food seemed a little better before the expansion but I went last night around closing so that could've been the difference. It won't effect my 5/5 stars. I'll still be back again. Try the calamari, caprese salad, anything w the vodka sauce (bc I love it!), the lobster ravioli all day, all the dessert, then do it again the next day!  Update:  now they have a delivery option!"}
{"text":"Service and food are excellent. First time I have tasted a really good Italian pizza, pasta, spaghetti, meatballs and calamare. Wished we have a location in Long Beach, Ca."}
{"text":"The executive chef Jason is a prodigy! Chicken parm was to die for, and everything was reasonably priced. Server was okay, you could tell she didn't want to be there, but we all have days like that.   I'd love to see them have some good wine specials to pair with the amazing food. Maybe do a meat and cheese plate paired with a featured wine? I'm not sure if they offer happy hour, but if so it isn't very well advertised   Glad I stumbled upon this neighborhood gem, I look forward to this becoming one of my regular spots."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time a few weeks ago and have been back weekly ever since. The food here is excellent. I have had the vodka pasta, chicken parmesan, a couple of their sandwiches, and the tiramisu. I have dined in and ordered for pick up. Nice place tucked into the Smith's shopping center in Southern Highlands. If you're looking for authentic Italian fare then check this place out to satisfy your cravings."}
{"text":"Prefect small authentic Italian deli/pasta bar where you can taste that all sauces and pastas are home made!  I had the chicken Cacciatore, amazing flavors my plate was loaded with chicken..  I definitely will make this place my new Italian to go place!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  I had the butternut squash ravioli special and it was out of this world delicious.  It was like eating dessert for dinner.  I have been here twice.  Once dining in and once for take-out.  Both times I received very good customer service.  I am definitely going to continue coming here."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Service was good.  All our meals were very good.   The chilli lasagna was the best.  I strongly recommend this place.  Make reservations Will be back What a great restaurant!  Had a great meal again!  Service a little slow but meals were hot and correct order."}
{"text":"Eh. Average. Bad service. I had the meatball sub and it left something to be desired...probably won't go back....there are too many places with similar food to waste my money on mediocrity."}
{"text":"We decided to try Spegetty Western for lunch yesterday.  It's a somewhat small storefront in the Southern Highlands strip mall.  We were greeted immediately upon entering and told we could take any open table we liked.  Since this is a small restaurant, there are not an abundance of tables, but we had a choice of 3 that were open.  Our waiter brought us waters and menus right away, and took our drink order.  We ordered a meatball sandwich (3 meatballs, marinara, meltedparmigiano and mozzarella) $10.95 and a chicken parm sandwich (fried chicken cutlet covered withmarinara, melted parmigiano and mozzarella) $11.95.  They were nice enough to cut the sandwiches in half and put 1/2 of each on each plate so we could share.  The homemade meatballs and chicken cutlets were both tasty, but really large for a sandwich, so we cut everything in half so we could pick them up to eat.  The bread was fresh and soft, the sauce was acidic, not sweet (just the way I like it), & the cheese was toasty and bubbly.  I was glad they brought a bowl of sauce because it was so good on the sandwiches, plus we could add it to the chicken and meatballs that didn't fit on the bread.  We will definitely be back for dinner to try the cavatelli, gnocchi, and other pasta dishes that looked amazing coming out of the kitchen.  And maybe a cannoli!"}
{"text":"Not impressed!  Called an order in for pick up and was told 20-25 minutes. (Guy on the phone was not very pleasant) Got there 30 minutes later and they still hadn't started my order.  I watched the cashier make my anti pasta appetizer and did not wear gloves..some people I know would freak out and leave the place.. I didn't  However, they got the rest of my order wrong and since it was now 45 minutes later, I said it was fine and left.  I don't think I will return. Their food is way expensive and should be better quality. The bread wasn't even good.  I'm bummed, cause it sounded like a great place according to other reviews."}
{"text":"For lack of a better intro to this review... Holy Crap. To call this place amazing wouldn't do it justice. It's rare to come across a restaurant that's not a chain off the strip, that just gets everything right... Spaghetti Western accomplishes that. We have passed by this place multiple times, but weren't sure about it. We've ate at all the other spots in this shopping center, but always skipped by this place for one reason or another. I saw a Groupon and decided that now would be as good of a time as any, low risk, high reward. Today I took my family here for lunch and we will definitely be back. We ordered the bruschetta to start, which was pretty well done. It tasted more like a vinaigrette on top of tomatoes than olive oil and herbs...but it was still delicious. We ordered the chicken Milanese for our son, my wife order the linguini scampi, and I went with a basic...spaghetti and meatballs. I always hear from all of the great chefs that when you go to a new place it's nice to sample the menu, but always start with something basic... if they get the basics right it's truly a good restaurant.. I've never dined at a place where that was more true. The sauce and meatballs were probably the most perfect I've had, and I come from an Italian family. My wife's scampi was perfect, and my son's chicken was very well seasoned and the potatoes were perfectly done. To quote my wife \" it's like they have a team of great grandmother's from Italy in the back working non stop\". After the meal my wife ordered the tiramisu and my son had the chocolate puffed pastry. They were both extremely happy and satisfied.   The service was really good, only negative was the pace of meal. My son's food came out with the appetizer and we were done eating for a while before the server came to offer desert and coffee. Our drinks were never empty and we never needed for anything, so the rest is just knit picking.   If you haven't tried this place, make sure you do. It is hands down the best Italian restaurant you can find in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Food is good, atmosphere is non existent and the chairs are really uncomfortable.  Better to take out than to eat in."}
{"text":"I am sorry to see some of these reviews, but they are quite the contrary to the experience I had.  I ordered food to go.  Normally I have to add some seasoning and Parmesan Romano cheese to my pasta.  I ordered the Cavatelli Rusticci, to try something like my mom would make when she ate pasta.  It was off of the charts delicious.  I had some for leftovers the next day and it still had the same phenomenal flavor it had the night before.  My food was correctly prepared and the person who helped me was very nice.  My portion was more than generous.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We were loyal customers here for over a year. I am not sure if they changed owners but it doesn't seem to be the same people. My husband's lobster ravioli is as good as ever, but everything I try to order is inedible. After 2 to go orders recently I won't be going back. Ordered tortellini with 4 cheese sauce. They gave me ravioli and the sauce tasted pastey like raw flour. The second time I decided to try alfredo. It tasted like nothing but cream, no cheese or seasonings. I am so disappointed. This was our go to italian spot."}
{"text":"This restaurant was terrible, what is worse is the response to my complaint from the poorly trained manager.  We ordered through bite squad, so the restaurant used them as a scapegoat for poor quality, and portion size.    We ordered for delivery the flash fried calamari, side caeear salad, charred octopus, caprese salad, lasagne, and tiramisu. The charred octopus had 4 tiny portions, and the calamari was a super small portion.  They stated \"we don't suggest ordering fried items for delivery\".  I said I never said we are unhappy with the calamari quality, only that there is such a small amount of octopus and calamari.  Side note, the charred octopus was flavorless.   The caprese salad does not list green olives or kalamata olives, they stated that they have tried to fix the menu on bite squad without success.  I stated the menu matched the restaurant menu on the restaurant website.  Also, the tomatoes are beefsteak tomatoes that are inedible because they are not fully ripened.  I had to use tomatoes from home in my caprese.  The caprese had overabundance of black pepper that cause me to sneeze horribly.   The side caesar looked like it could have been out of a bag.  Some of the lettuce was brown and there was very little dressing, and few croutons. The lasagne had very little sauce, and was stone cold and flavorless. Our bill was $90.00, granted it's a little more costly through bite squad, but still that's just craziness to charge what they do for portion and quality!"}
{"text":"Food first: outstanding! Not a sugar-shack red, not a ketsup meatloaf. These guys are the real deal. Service is a tad under the back of the house. But well meaning and competent. Overall, front and back create a pleasurable experience. Pretensions and noses-high may be welcome. But check attitude at the door. Enter expecting Good service and great food."}
{"text":"I ordered the salmon, asked for it to be medium well and crispy on the outside. I was served salmon that was basically sushi.   The garlic bread was good, maybe the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"We had butternut squash baked ravioli, penne with meat sauce, and pasta Diablo. All three were very good. The butternut squash was extraordinary: the first bite was so flavorful it was like cake.  The server was very friendly and helpful. She coached is through the menu when we asked, and made sure I had enough cappuccino.  It was hard to tell they were open: they should have better signage. Now that I know, we will be back often."}
{"text":"We went here last night. My dinner was delicious!! The service was great, and our cannoli was yummy!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Spaghetty Western, but I went with family who had been once before and loved it.  Unfortunately, the consensus was that this visit provided very sub-par service.   We were seated right away; the dining room is small and a bit cramped.  This is sort of a \"hole in the wall\" Italian place, but sometimes those can have the best food.   The theme is perfect for their name with a combination of Italian and Western décor (check out the horses in the bathroom - you'll see what I mean).  The dining room seemed fairly full.  We ordered drinks, and then we waited at least 10 minutes before anything showed up.  These were simple soft drinks and coffee that didn't require any preparation.  When the server returned he had forgotten one of the drinks.  There was no apology when we reminded him.  We ordered a starter, a salad, and three entrees.  Fifteen minutes later or so the three entrees arrived.  We informed the food runner (someone different than the server) that we hadn't received the starter or salad yet.  His response \"Ok, I can go get those.\"  Again, no apology.  The table was then loaded with plates for everything we had ordered.  Not exactly the leisurely meal we had expected.  Then we noticed we hadn't been given a bread basket.  Again we asked.  Response:  \"Oh yeah, I can get bread.\" Again, no apology.  After the meal we asked about the dessert menu.  The server said they don't have a menu, but he said he would be right back to list off the choices.  Maybe 10 minutes later he returned.    As for the food...  We ordered the charcuterie sampler board as a starter.  A large portion of assorted sliced meats and cheeses.  These were very tasty and seemed of solid quality.  We had a house salad as well which was different and involved some greens as well as tomatoes, olives, sun dried tomatoes, and artichoke.  Different, but not bad.  Then we had the Eggplant Parmesan, Spaghetty Western, and Spaghetti and Meatballs.  These all were quite good.  The Western in particular was a unique dish with sautéed deli meats and green peas.  It all worked well together with a zesty sauce.  The Eggplant was good with large pieces of eggplant with just the right amount of cheese and sauce.  The meatballs in the spaghetti and meatballs were very good and definitely tasted homemade with a wonderful seasoning.  For desserts we went for tiramisu, cheesecake, and key lime cheesecake.  Again, all very good.  The tiramisu was the star here with moist cake soaked with a coffee flavor and just enough sweetness.   The overall verdict was very good food and very poor service.  But, I think I would be willing to try it again since service can fluctuate a bit from visit to visit at a lot of places."}
{"text":"So good!! First time here, was a little busy but called ahead to make a reservation and had a seat as soon as we got in! Had the pasta vodka was delish!! Lobster ravioli was great said my dad and the chicken park was amazing said my boyfriend !! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"If I could make it a - star I would. My waiter did not check up on us at least one time. The only time He came around is to ask if we want drinks.  Because I'm nice I'm not going to put his name on this review however I would not recommend this place to no one. The only recommendation I would say is to NOT TO GO !!! I don't know if he didn't check up on us because  We weren't \"WHITE\"? He gave customer service to the white families!   Not saying his racist.... but actions show :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. It's a small, family run restaurant and their service is always quick and friendly. Today was the third or fourth time we've been here.   This was my second time having th pasta diablo. It's always delicious. It has the perfect amount of spice to give it a good kick, and I love olives. I've also had the gnocchi and it is amazing.   My boyfriend always tries something different, but he always likes it. He had the meatballs and they were tasty. He's also had the chicken parm and liked that too.   The prices are a mid range, but given the taste and service, I definitely think it's worth it. The small, intimate atmosphere makes it a great date place, but it would also be great for a small gathering with friends."}
{"text":"First, they deliver! Have you ever heard of an Italian place that delivers?!   My husband and I ordered the Spagetti & Meatballs with Garlic bread and it was fantastic! The food is very authentic and delicious and the man I spoke to on the phone was very friendly. He was a little hard to understand on the phone because of his thick Italian accent - but none the less it's a wonderful place that just opened."}
{"text":"Ashamed to say we've been coming here since they opened and I am just now posting. They are obviously doing well since they have been able to go through a remodel and now an expansion, which thrills me. The food here is SOOO good I hope they are around forever.  Truth be told, I've almost always ordered only the spaghetti and meatballs as my main. The sauce is incredible, and I've never had a better meatball. Portions are huge so there's always enough for a second meal. We start with the Caprese salad (the version with oregano and capers) and could never think of skipping this addictive starter. We occasionally order to pick up and everything is packed so well. The hot stays hot, the cold stays cold. When we dine there, we always order a bottle of wine and enjoy the off the beaten path but reasonably priced selections. We are usually so stuffed by the time we leave that we get tiramisu to go because it can't be missed.  We love Spaghetty Western!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we finally tried Spaghetty Western! Never judge a restaurant by it's name cause I thought-what a weird combo, Italian and Western?? Uh NO...but it is actually an authentic Italian deli and restaurant, so authentic that the first time we dined there, there was an older Italian grandmotherly woman yelling at someone else in Italian in the kitchen!  The first time we were there, I tried their gnocchi in pesto/Gorgonzola sauce and the mister had their chili lasagna.  He LOVED his lasagna so much that he ordered the same thing the second time we went.  The gnocchi was good but I felt the sauces needed a little more flavor (maybe more garlic or salt or cheese?).  Second time, I ordered the Fisherman's Cioppino Pasta...it was SO good!! For $18.95 I would definitely order this dish again but I really want to try a lot of their other pasta options.  Portions are pretty big so the gnocchi I had was taken home and reheated the next day and it was even better the next day as the gnocchi softened up a bit.  The Cioppino did not last another day, I ate the whole entire entree and practically licked the plate.  We did take a tiramisu home the first visit and the slice was huge and delicious also!"}
{"text":"This little deli/restaurant is awesome! I'm so glad we found this by looking on Yelp! Everyone inside is nice and the guys have a great thick Italian accent. My wife loves the prosciutto so I usually get some sliced to take home. The meatball sandwich is delicious and they even give you a little side of extra marinara sauce (at least with to go orders). The tiramisu is amazing from what my wife says. I'll continue to go back whenever I can."}
{"text":"David the owner was kind enough to reach out to me shortly after my bad delivery experience (the order was placed through Yelp so it wasn't actually the company's delivery driver). Very hospitable and he was very sincere about making things right. Will definitely come back and visit. Definitely some of the best Italian food on the south/southwest part of town."}
{"text":"Here for a basketball tourney. My son had to carb up. The place was empty, we got good service and great food and the food came out quick. My son had speghetti and meatballs and I had a salad that had Italian dressing and salami. They also carry an amazing blueberry heffinweizin on tap. A little pricey but good."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever. Creepy weirdo server named Alex takes our order, doesn't write it down, and doesn't even put it in. 45 minutes later we ask where our food is and the guy is almost dumbfounded that I called him out on shitty service and not putting the order through. It's unfortunate that these great places have to be ruined by such terrible service. Call me when Alex isn't serving here and I'll be happy to try it again since everyone else seemed to be friendly"}
{"text":"I'm sorry maybe I'm just this weird woman who've decided to live my life by leaving reviews online that isn't true.. Yes it was a while back and I never decided to go back neither did I want anything in return from you guys for finding hair in my food so I didn't care to call or waste my gas and drive back there, there's nothing you could of done. IT WAS MULTIPLE STRINGS OF HAIR IN MY FOOD, MULTIPLE!!!! Now calm down. No one is out to get you, go spend time fixing the problem instead of thinking the CIA sent me to leave a fake review"}
{"text":"Went to a concert at the M last night and this popped up on \"restaurants near me\" so we decided to try it. We live in the opposite side of town and are always looking for good places to eat. Food was amazing! I chose the eggplant Parmesan. Hubz had the Italian Caprese Sanny, The other couple we were with had Spaghetti and Meatballs and the chopped salad. The eggplant parm was delicious! There is something about the marinara sauce-it's light but, still full of flavor. Eggplant was also on point and no bitterness at all. Service was great and personable. Will definitely try this place again and it's definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"All the food is great!  A real authentic Italian chef and his family. Locally owned.  My favorite is the spaghetti and peppers!  My wife loves the lobster ravioli."}
{"text":"VERY UNSATISFIED!!!  Ordered for delivery and yes I was informed it would take about an hour.. I kid you not 2 HRS LATER my food arrived and not only was it cold it was spilled all over inside the bag. Called to speak with someone and it went to answering machine. NOT HAPPY. NEVER AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite Italian Restaurants in Las Vegas. It's a little on the pricey side but it is worth it.  The pastas are delicious and the portions are really large!  You will usually have food tot take home.  I highly recommend the Baked Mostaccioli!   Not a very upscale or romantic Italian Restaurant. More of a nice place to eat with the family."}
{"text":"live in the neighborhood and several of my friends told me it was very good, large portions, fairly priced.  I went in a little before closing on a Wednesday and ordered the lasagna to go.  I think it was about $11.85 with tax.  When I got home the container that the lasagna was in was smaller than a Big Mac box.  While it was tastey, I thought based on what came home with me, they were way over priced.  There was also a picece of garlic bread.  It had huge chunks of garlic.  I really liked it, because I love garlic, but I know the rest of my family would have said it had too much garlic."}
{"text":"This review is based on take out, as I actually never been to the restaurant (my fiancé picks it up for me!). The last few times the pasta was undercooked and this last time (about 2 weeks ago) the bread it comes with was no longer garlic bread, it was plain white bread, no butter.     After reading some of the reviews it seems to do with the expansion (change of ownership or chef?). I can't honestly say, but when we first started ordering (which by the way, they still had delivery), it was absolutely delicious! Now it's gotten mediocre for the price. I'm hoping the next time will be better. And they bring back delivery!"}
{"text":"was awesome as usual. Great portions leave you full and satisfied. My wife ordered Chicken Piccata and loved the flavor. I ordered the DK Special and they made it up custom for me. It was angel hair pasta with olive oil & garlic. I added in broccoli, peas and chicken. VERY HEALTHY!! Bellisimo!!Karen & Alex are excellent team members that provide flawless service with a big smile. EAT HERE!!  Went to this restaurant again last night for early dinner with an out of town relative. Service from Alex was exceptional. The Octopus salad is \"killer\" and the mussels were awesome also. Lots of fresh bread for dipping in that broth. We do take out often and this place NEVER DISSAPOINTS!!!!!!!   Great meal again on Friday night with friends. Food was very good as usual. I ordered Sole Milanese and it was very tasty. See picture  It's Saturday Sept 30. Just had another rediculously delicious meal at Spaghetti Western. Then crushed a great dessert, Vanilla Gelato with Espresso poured over it. OMG"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing lunch. The food was outstanding, the portions were huge and Alex was terrific."}
{"text":"WOW - they're back at it again with the great food! After recently expanding next door, there is more seating which allows you to experience the true Italian cuisine!  The food is amazing, and the staff is very friendly, and able to maintain that close, family service attitude. I am very impressed!  We had the Cavatelli Rustici & their Special of the Day: a wonderful Pappardelle Recipe!  I am a huge fan of homemade pastas, and this place hits home!   I know with expanding restaurants there are going to be growing pains, which was apparent with some food logistics issues, but they were able to maintain their composure and accommodated us for our extended wait time.  This is a great place, and a great gem in the Southern Highlands Community.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing loved the chef. The tall man at the counter with dark hair was a real hoot and made me laugh my entire visit. However the blond waitress with the bad breast implants was a complete train wreck. In the short time I was there she swore at her coworkers and yelled at her boss. I'd go back for the food any day of the week, as long as it was a day she wasn't working. The business has a lot of potential but I don't know what the owner is thinking keeping that rude bimbo around."}
{"text":"Had the vegetarian lasagna, house salad and this fudge/cookie cake ... Delicious!! Absolutely delicious! Can't wait to try all the other menu items."}
{"text":"So first time here.  Stopped in for lunch today a weekday at about noon nice little place clean and staff was very nice.  The reason why I'm only giving it 3 stars was I ordered the caprese  sandwich and really it wasn't worth it for $9.95  It was huge (even posted a shot of it) had great flavor to the balsamic and usual greens but really just one thick piece of Mozarella  cheese on it..just one. The  bad part about the sandwich  was the bread was very bready and very dried out so I ended up just leaving most of the bread on the plate.  Not sure how the cook could have not noticed that it was so dry and getting hard. hmmm. I could have mentioned the dried out bread (the main part of a sandwich) but I usually don't  make a stink in local places that are not chains. Kinda hoped they would have asked how everything  was but never did so I just let it pass.  However I did see everyone else getting some great looking pasta so next time I'm going to order that.  I really want to like this place I am going to return and give it another try. Order the Pasta would be my tip, wish I had  :("}
{"text":"I have never left a review for any restaurant before and it upsets me to do so, but I have never had a dining experience like the one I received this evening. So I'll simply stick to what happened rather than how it made me feel.  Shortly after entering the restaurant and standing in line behind an elderly couple, another couple walked in behind me. Both couples were taken to be seated while I was overlooked. After realizing the mistake, there weren't any readily available clean tables, so the wait continued.  After being seated, the wait continued for 21 minutes until we were approached by Peggy. She offered to comp our beverages for the long wait. We ordered both our drinks and meals at the same time. Another 10 minutes later, exactly 31 minutes since arriving at the table, there were still no drinks in front of us or the waters that we requested. The person I was dining with proceeded to the bar to request the waters from the bartender while also telling her our wine order. He brought the waters back to the table and the bartender brought the wine, while Peggy, still too busy to visit our table. Another gentleman brought out our meals and Peggy checked on us at the same time to see if we wanted cheese on top of our dishes. At this point, I realized that the pasta in my meal was incorrect- I requested linguine and received spaghetti. After already regretting the time spent at the restaurant, I brought this to Peggy's attention. After asking several times if I was okay with the spaghetti, the dish was finally sent back to the kitchen. Peggy returned moments later stating that the kitchen was out of linguine.  Ultimately, I was given spaghetti with the impression that I wouldn't notice the difference. Additionally, I had to request for bread to be brought to the table. The entire experience was extremely unacceptable.  My expectations never pertained to receiving a comped meal. It was the principle- the fact that I was given a meal that I didn't order, without any consideration to my preferences. While this alone should have deemed the meal worthy of being comped; it wasn't. Based on my overall experience this evening, I will not be returning, and it is my best recommendation that other patrons stay clear.  To say that the entire experience was bad because of our server Peggy, would not be fair- The entire staff essentially is to blame. Where one fails, another surely should be able to pick up the slack. My dining experience did not start on a positive note, which should have left an opportunity to recover. Unfortunately however, it only continued to spiral downwards.  I particularly find fault in Peggy attempting to force me to enjoy a dining experience that had nothing positive going for it. I don't believe her attempt at recovery was the appropriate way to rectify the situation. It only elevated my dissatisfaction towards the experience. I've refrained from interjecting my personal feelings during this review. However, if I were to include how I currently feel, humiliated is the first word that comes to mind."}
{"text":"Man oh man... i read some reviews on this place after i grabbed a quick bite with my girlfriend. i have no idea what these reviewers are talking about... i walked in this place and had service immediately even though the joint was 3/4 capacity. Not only were they friendly and helpful, but the food came out shockingly quickly. Coming from a very critical executive food and beverage family, i thought the food was delicious. Not a single thing left on the plate. As far as their authentic deli... WOW!!!! Very hard to find excellent Italian deli meat. They carry the real deal. Not that mass-produced, overpriced Boars Head crap. if you're looking for a casual \"hole in the wall\" type Italian restaurant or divine deli meat. Check this place out.  i know i will come out of my way to come back here!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. I moved to Southern Highlands and seriously felt like I gained 10 pounds with how much I go here. They are all so kind and their food is incredibly good for how fast they are. My new obsession!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich I ever had hands down. The calabrese unfortunately I don't eat cheese but I feel like it didn't even need it. Omg the meat I can't even explain and I've had a lot of sandwiches in my life. Fresh veggies topped with Italian dressing and peppers. The flavor! Oh I can't forget the bread so soft and warm. The bf got the lasagna he loved it.  Genuine, nice people. Amazing service, feels like home. And great beer!!"}
{"text":"The pastas here are simple but tasty.  I've had a few run ins with slow waitresses but the Times were they were spot on made up for it.  There's even a deli in here along with a good list of wines. I'd recommend making return trips here if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We love it here this is what Southern Highlands needed the food is always fresh great  atmosphere,  all the waiters are  very nice including Alex he's the best I've been going here for years . We tried almost everything on the menu except the pizza. Even the owners are great they come to your table ask you if everything's okay that's what restaurants should always do care about their customers."}
{"text":"Love love love Spaghetty Western, its my to-go comfort italian food. They make everything from scratch, the servers are attentive and friendly! The only thing tho is its a super small restaurant, so make sure you call before coming in :-)"}
{"text":"Love Italian food!! This mom and papa spot it on point !!! The food and service is great !! Highly recommended them"}
{"text":"Love this place. Relaxed setting with awesome food. I started with the Western House Salad and it was excellent. I then had the Fettuccine Alfredo. I asked to add onion and mushroom and I was readily accommodated. It was perfect. The staff was attentive and friendly. On the way out, the owner stopped us to see how we enjoyed the experience. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We order to-go often and the food is always just right. We try something different almost every time and never feel disappointed. If you haven't tried it yet feel comfortable giving them a shot at your business."}
{"text":"Another recommendation from my buddy. This spot is a tiny family owned Italian place. I love family spots like this! Its cozy and its authentic. The portions are HUGE and cheap. We had the chicken penne ala vodka. That pink sauce tho. Dipped that garlic bread in that sauce. Perfecto! \"I had the \"Alex's salad\" which consisted on olives, artichokes, salami, sundried tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and arugula). My wife and I shared everything. Portions were sooooo huge! Of course not to forget dessert, the home-made cannolis! Just like back home in NY. Very good. I drove all the way from Summerlin area to Southern Hills for this and I definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Best girl  bartender and great service , the best taramasu u have had in a long time, great food,  wouldn't expect it. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"This little cafe brings fine dining to a casual setting. The care that the staff takes in preparing dishes is equal to that of a traditional high end restaurant.  Behind the counter the wait staff is having fun with each other while preparing amazing food.   I had the pasta and peppers that were amazing flavorful and filling. The eggplant parm was equally as delicious. Even though the price is slightly higher than you'd typically see at a deli it is well worth it due to the portion size.   Great quality and care put into every dish I saw come out. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had lunch at the spaghetty western restaurant.  The food was great! Real italian food made fresh.  The restaurant was empty when i arrived then by the time my party left the tables were pretty full.   I ordered the chicken saltimbocca.  I was surprised the pasta was served separately from the chicken but all in all it was great.  The chicken was nicely thin cuts of the breast with fresh prosciutto and mozzarella cheese. Mmmm. The lasagna was also great.  Not to over powering flavors everything was yummy."}
{"text":"I am so stuffed and can't finish it all! We ordered from the lunch specials menu. For $10.99 we each got a choice of a side, a main dish, and a soft drink. We both chose the side salad which included mixed greens, sun dried tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, and artichoke hearts with a house vinaigrette. We both gobbled it down! \"House bread\" came hot-from-the-oven served with herbed olive oil. For main courses, my husband ordered spaghetti and meatballs while I ordered fettuccine with vodka sauce and added chicken for $1.00 more. My husband said that he intended to eat just half and save the rest for another meal, but it was so good that he just couldn't stop! Mine was equally excellent. My mouth wanted to continue, but my tummy begged me to stop. Our server brought me an aluminum pan for leftovers. When she saw that I had grabbed the bread, also, and placed it on top, she brought me a sheet of foil to wrap it. We left very full and happy campers!"}
{"text":"The pizza was one of the best I ever had! Seems to be family owned. Good atmosphere. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"We eat here about once every week and it's pretty good usually.  Today was no different except the service was awful.  I told the server that they forgot to bring us part of our order and he began to argue that he didn't and that i was mistaken.  I think i know what we ordered since i order the same thing every time.  What happened to customer service?"}
{"text":"Good Evening! I just wanted to take a minute and compliment you on your wonderful business. It seems these days we go out of our way to complain, but never take the time to acknowledge hard work and excellent quality.   We've never dined in your establishment, but we hope to one day. We have ordered delivery through Postmates a couple of times though. And I can only imagine how excellent your food is in person. We have now tried eight dishes altogether and we have yet to taste anything that isn't superb. (Even as leftovers several days in a row)   For our last delivery, we ended up eating rather late and placed our order towards the end of your business hours. Some lovely person included an extra dish (I assume to avoid having to throw it away at the end of the night). The extra dish of tortellini with sausage in a spicy sauce has quickly become a favorite. You are very thoughtful, and in such a difficult industry, you shine."}
{"text":"We discovered this place on Yelp. It's in a shopping center and you'd easily pass it by. It's family owned and operated and its pretty surprising to see some much TLC going into food in a strip mall. My wife was very happy to get the a sample of veggie lasagne, even though they were out. We ended up coming back again before we left. The staff is hilarious too. What a fun and delicious place."}
{"text":"Great food ! Great service ! It's a small place but they are expanding and they have every right too. I had the chicken parmigiana and I have to say it was prepared very well and the portion was well worth it! All in all I had a very good experience I would highly recommend Spaghetty Western."}
{"text":"Delicious pastas! Definitely coming back when we're back in town! Size, portion and price we're reasonable."}
{"text":"Had postmates deliver. Food was good, tomato sauce especially. I think I read somewhere that they make it in house..? Regardless . Will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I found Spaghetti Western entirely by accident.  Certainly the most delicious and enjoyable accident of our lives.  Not only was the food comparable to the best Italian food I've had in NYC and LA but was better than most of the Italian food I enjoyed in both Italy and Sicily  Equally enjoyable was the service and opportunity to meet and speak with the owner chef and his delightful wife.  From now on Spaghetti Western will be a mandatory stop on our way to and from Las Vegas.  Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"I just have to say, eating Italian my whole life and becoming kind of sick of it over the years... time and time again WHENEVER I am craving delicious, consistently good pasta this is the best place in Vegas. Hands down for delicious pasta that is either a 9/10 or 10/10 every single time. Doesn't matter which chef, how busy they are etc. the food is just consistently good and that is a rarity now a days. The carbonara, pomodoro, and their bobby pasta are faves among all my friends.   If you're new to town, just visiting... want a delicious and authentic bite of Italian pasta, as corny as it sounds. You have to try this place. I've ordered here or eaten here about 30 times over the last 3 years and my only ever food complaints were that I didn't order more. Seriously. It's that good. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"They recently remodeled and it is our first time being back after it. They took their very good small deli and restaurant and turned it into a very amazing night out. Their food is still outstanding along with their service, and now it is the perfect place for a date night. They also have TVs so you can also watch a sports game."}
{"text":"Good food even better service and staff. Mom and pop type atmosphere. Gnoki was amazing. Would like to see fresh mushrooms used in the future.   Oh yeah desserts are all ready and in to go containers for you.  Can't say no."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Italian Restaurant in Las Vegas!  My husband David Marosi and I just love this place.  My grandparents are straight from Italy so I've been raised on good Italian food. Thus, making me a very picky eater of Italian food.  We have brought our friends here and they also loved it. My eggplant was cooked to perfection.  We love the owner and Lydia one of the chefs knows how to make a phenomenal sauce. We have never experienced bad service.  In fact, we get incredible 5 star service every time we have gone.  The restaurant has a great ambiance.  If in Vegas, you must try this restaurant.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Small place, but the pasta was cooked to perfection.   Enjoyed the vodka sauce and the atmosphere.   We brought our own wine and everyone enjoyed the food.  I think the tightness of the restaurant took away from it being a perfect place.  The tiramisu was excellent.  Not to sweet and plenty of coffee taste.   Coffee was wonderful."}
{"text":"This food is fantastic! We have been here several times and can't get enough of it. The service is friendly, the food is always delicious and the atmosphere is quaint and comfortable. You'll love this place"}
{"text":"It was my 1st time here, and it was such a great experience! The staff was so friendly, and the food was amazing! Awesome house salad dressing (always a plus for me), the bruschetta was perfectly delicious, and the vodka sauce and meatballs were to die for. I also loved the family owned atmosphere and seeing the bosses help out around the restaurant. Will definitely be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"While visiting Henderson for work and play, we stopped in to Spaghetty Western for some good, homestyle Italian food, based on the reviews we read.  The service we received was very nice...  Menu was quite nice as well.  We ordered a couple of chicken dishes and started with their meatballs... The meatballs were AMAZING!  Nice & Tender and packed with flavor!  The Chicken Marsala was incredible, had to sop up the sauce with garlic bread!!  The only issue is the setting... It's not very \"romantic\" nor perfect... it's an Italian deli with a kitchen & stove right behind the counter.  It is fun and nice to see your food being cooked.  It's quite small inside as well.  Food is awesome though, so give it a try, especially if you live in the area!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Staff was great and friendly! Pasta was delicious and loved the caprese salad. Great place to go for Italian food off the strip. Would definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat.  Everything is fresh.  Small and busy on the weekends, so hard to get a table. Chicken Parm is off the hook.  The calamari is the best I have had, and I have had it all over the world.  I have eaten here numerous times and never disappointed. Each dish is excellent."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful, friendly staff.  We dined in and our food took a while but it was worth it. They have a great marinara, pasta is perfectly cooked. I love that they offer 1/2 portions on many of the dishes as well. All of the ingredients seem very fresh.  Next time I look forward to trying the pizzas, they looked great."}
{"text":"Love the food here!!! It's a must stop every Vegas visit now. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The vibe is lively making it a great family environment or friends night out. What better way to catch up other than over good food and wine? The food!!! I haven't had anything that hasn't tasted like a home cooked meal here. The calamari is the softest I've ever had and seasoned so well! Last night we tried the mushroom app for the first time which I'd order again. You can never go wrong with meatballs. I don't typically order chicken when I'm out although I've tried 3 chicken dishes here so far. All of them were amazing; full of taste, fresh and the portions generous. We've tried multiple pasta dishes too. Red sauce, oil & garlic, pink sauce... All fantastic! The only problem is we needed more bread to finish the sauce after our pasta was done. Lastly, the desserts. I would recommend ordered the tiramisu for an app. If there is anything you have to have its their tiramisu. Hand down the best I've ever had. Don't trust me try it yourself. Make a reservation! Although it's worth the wait if you don't."}
{"text":"Great food...horrible customer service!!! Inpatient and rude blonde waitress with no personality and always in a big big rush!! Rude, bitter, and not helpful or friendly at all!!! I chewed her out when she pretty much stated that she was done for the evening and gave me a choice on how to handle my bill with an \"ultimatum\" type of rude and sarcastic attitude!!! Ugh...!!!!!! I went off on her because this was my second visit there with her as my waitress & I was put off by her service & attitude the first time, and this incident set me off!! She had no remorse and did not seem to care one bit!! She has no place being a waitress!!!  Too bad...if it weren't for her deplorable service, I would give this place 5 stars!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely LOVED this restaurant. LOVED. Their food is beyond amazing! However, after their expansion service has gone down the toilet. We have given this restaurant 3 chances after the re-opening and every single time the lack of attentiveness is insane. To say that you have to wait 25 minutes for water... What the hell. We were willing to pay the hefty prices of the food, however to be made to feel as completely unimportant is unacceptable. The servers are rude, short with you and uninterested in \"serving\" your table. It really sucks. Tonight will be our last meal here."}
{"text":"Our first visit to the restaurant, excellent service,food and you must ask for the server Clemente!"}
{"text":"Ironically enough I had helped the owner at one point and for him to mention that he owns a mom n pop italian restaurant...I was totally in! Got there the next week and the owner didn't recognize me at first, but soon warmed up. Had to try the meat lasagna and was not disappointed.  Food was huge which was what I liked! Great job spaghetti western! Will be back for seconds, thirds, forths..."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and in the neighborhood and they deliver as well.we ordered antipasto and chicken parmagiana and spaghetti and lasagne and everything was excellent"}
{"text":"This place is amazing ,  I'm addicted to this place.... It truly is amazing! They are real Italians that work there. The cannolis are  to die for I literally go there almost everyday to get some."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in Las Vegas. It's too hard to recommend a specific dish however the meatballs are phenomenal as is the Penne Bobbi. Unlike many restaurants this place is a TRUE Italian place to dine."}
{"text":"It is really exciting to see that we are getting more delicious restaurants in Southern Highlands. I stopped in and was immediately helped; the chef himself came out and explained information about food choices. I went with his recommendations and my husband and I were very pleased with the food I brought home that night."}
{"text":"Do NOT skip the fried mozzarella sticks! I'm not usually a fan, but these are delicious! \"Legalize marinara!\""}
{"text":"I was skeptical for sure. The name threw me off. It's me!!!  I had been by the place several times. I really never thought of even reading the menu.  Tonight was the night.  And the clincher is...i walked in and did an order to go. Togo food usually isn't as good once it gets home. I was also on my motorcycle with a backpack.  I ordered Chicken Parmesan. I explained i was on my bike and asked could they pack it separate. They did as i requested. The guys at the counter were polite and efficient. The food was hot when i got home and nothing spilled out. Super good Chicken Parmesan. I will be back for sure.  I could have waited at the bar. The circumstances this time weren't right. But, the bar tender had the customers served and happily imbibing."}
{"text":"If you're in the area and craving a good Italian spot, this place is good choice!    Decided to try their daily special, had their Penne Diablo.  Usually they make it with sausage but I had them change it out for chicken...delicious!  The peppercinis, salami, pepperoni, sun dried tomatoes, and chicken with the penne was super tasty.  Add some pepper flakes and it's even better. The pasta was made al dente, just right.  Service is great, our server was very attentive and kept the drinks filled and very friendly.  Definitely will come back when I'm around this side of town."}
{"text":"The food is okay.. I ordered the bologonese pasta.. The sauce was a little bland.. My husband  ordered the pepperoni pizza and although he liked it, I thought it had an odd flavor..a smokey flavor, we think from the cheese. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. We will return because I would like to try a white sauce."}
{"text":"Solid stuff. Proper wine glasses. Delicious pizza. Good for takeout. Service is good enough for being by the house."}
{"text":"My buddy and I went for the first time last Saturday night (6/16/18) and I'm telling you right now, this is one of the best Italian restaurants I've ever been to in Vegas. Everything about this place was just right.   1.) Service was on point... waiter (I think his name was LeMetta... sorry I probably misspelled his name) was incredibly attentive and friendly. Everything came out super quick. Very impressive considering how busy it got by 7:00.  2.) Food was EXCELLENT... my chicken cacciatore was perfect, possibly the best I've had in Vegas. My buddy also loved his meal... I took one of his meatballs, and it was also great.   3.) Live music was PERFECT... singing piano man Peter sang the best songs and took our requests. Very impressed with his music. He really added to the quality of the experience. I hope they have him sing there on a regular basis.  4.) Other positives include the decor, they've got a bunch of movie posters on the wall (love the Fistful of Dollars poster - great touch!!) and the cheesecake... MAN THAT WAS SO GOOD. I took it home and finished it in about 5 minutes LOL  We will DEFINITELY be back soon. Please don't change a thing. Thank you for a great dinner and experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Can't believe I've lived in this neighborhood for four years and hadn't been there yet. Was taking tiny bites because I didn't want it to end."}
{"text":"Had actually gotten take out and everything was amazing, but my favorite was the penne with vodka sauce. I could eat the entire thing on my own. Can't wait to try the food at the restaurant because it's even better when it's fresh!"}
{"text":"What a great Italian dinner experience. The atmosphere is relaxed and yet chick. Service is second to none. And the food is fabulous. Congratulations David and Marti on the expansion and remodeling!"}
{"text":"This is why I love Groupon. My friend and I were traveling to Vegas and wanted to get some good deals on food, and this was one we saw featured. Because it's nowhere near the strip (it was about a $20 Lyft ride from the Hard Rock Hotel), we would have never found this place. My only regret is that I was extremely hungover so I wasn't able to fully enjoy the meal, but once I got some bruschetta in me, I was able to eat enough to make it well worth the trip.  Pros:  -It's a cute, locally owned joint with a fun theme. The western film posters are fun, and it still manages to feel middle upscale. -The owner was active in the restaurant, helping out his single waitress during the midday shift on a Thursday when it was surprisingly pretty busy.  -The women's restroom has complementary feminine products and a sugar scrub for your hands. It's a nice touch -Of course, the food was AMAZING. I would definitely recommend this place to locals.  Cons: -The only con was I ordered chicken on my salad, but when it arrived, it was chickenless. I asked for the strips after it came but didn't receive them until almost the end of our meal. It was okay though because the owner apologized profusely and comped the charge."}
{"text":"Veal parmigiana was superb. Great bottle of wine for $18. Server Jessie is witty and bawdy in a good way. Our stay was fun and we will return soon. Great restaurant !"}
{"text":"What can I say, we were extremely impressed! My husband and I have lived in Southern Highlands for many years but just decided to give them a try for lunch. It's really nice inside, clean and open. The booths were comfortable and it's an inviting atmosphere.  We were promptly greeted and escorted to our booth. The server was upbeat and sweet which was appreciated. The menu was very diverse and offered a lot of dishes besides the \"normal\" Italian cuisine.  We decided on the fried calamari to start..when it arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to see that it came with 3 shrimp as well! They were lightly seasoned and fried and were delicious! I don't think we would order the calamari again because it was chewy, but we asked if we could just prefer the shrimp and they said absolutely!  We decided to split the Chicken Parmesan and I'm so glad we did. Not only was it delicious, but the portion was perfect for splitting!  The owner came and introduced himself and talked a bit, that really speaks a lot of the establishment. He invited us back for happy hour, which is 4-7pm nightly at the bar. Can't wait to take advantage of that!  When we were leaving our server gave us complimentary Canolis which were delicious as well.  Overall we were really happy with everything and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is........BOMB! I ordered two pasta meatballs for the hubby and kids and a lobster ravioli for myself. the portions are big and the service was fast. I called to order and within 20 minutes our was already ready. Definitely going to order from this place again."}
{"text":"I wish they had a way to order food online and just pick it up ourselves. Whenever we call in an order it's made incorrectly and when we order through the delivery service it takes almost 2 hours to get our food.   The food is good but honestly the Chinese place is in the same business park, gets the orders right, and delivers within 20 - 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Yummy !!! The best Gravy I've had out west since New York, NY there going to be expanding very soon also . A little family owned hole in the wall .And we all know those are the best"}
{"text":"Was driving by and saw this place.. Has no idea it was even here.. Got excited... Went in and ordered based on recommendations from the person at the counter... This was for take out btw, after arriving home and looking at the food... It was heartbreaking.. It appeared to be warmed up airplane food.. But I  thought it had to taste good, I watched them make it fresh... But it wasn't... 42.00 wasted...  It appears to be family owned and it was amusing to listen to the folks working talking trash about the ones who weren't there at the time...."}
{"text":"We order the fettuccine chicken Alfredo, And Bobbi. The chicken Alfredo had 0 cheese, was not creamy what so ever, and was just butter and olive oil. Do not recommend. The Bobbi had 0 vodka sauce at all, and was drenched in olive oil, it puddled the bottom of the plate."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Italian food. I love the caprese salad! So good!  My kids get spaghetti with meat sauce every time.  Portions are big enough to share.  Service always with a smile."}
{"text":"This is he first time we have eaten from Spaghetty Western. We had the food delivered to the house and the delivery time was quick. I had the meatball sandwich and it was excellent and was still hot considering it was being delivered. My wife had the Magnificent 7 sandwich and thought it was very good and fresh. She said it was an interesting combination of flavors that you would not find at a typical sub shop.  The only thing preventing a five star rating is the lack of side item choices. Each sandwich came with a bag of chips, but we'd like to have options for the sides. We will order from here again."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised the addition to the larger restaurant is a homerun. The food was good portions could be a little larger price is a little high but doable. I think what would really put this restaurant over the top is a $25 spaghetti and meatball dinner for the whole family"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp because I didn't want to eat on the Strip and I wanted to eat where the locals go. This place was amazing! The menu offered someone foe everyone and the staff was so friendly and accommodating! I really enjoyed my charcuterie platter...it was so large that i had the rest for breakfast! Our waitress was also from where my father and I grew up in New Jersey! She was so kind! She is one of the main reasons why i would come back to this amazing restaurant!"}
{"text":"Me and my gf were craving for pasta and instead of going to cpk we wanted to try some place different. When we walked thru the doors we were instantly greeted by the hostess (gave her star for that) and she seated us. We waited awhile for our waiter, once he came he asked if we wanted any drinks. We got our drinks and we ordered our food. After we ordered our food that was the last time we heard from him (besides giving us our check). We see him helping other tables except for ours. We got our food my gf got the Alfredo fettuccine and I got the chicken piccata (sauce was to watery). I think cpks is much better lol. Gf wanted Parmesan cheese tried to wave down our waiter but did not even look our way so I asked another waiter who's cleaning a table next to us. At first he came off kinda rude because when I asked him if I could have some Parmesan he said \"just a second\" without looking at me while cleaning the table. If I was the waiter I would've stop what I was doing and help a paying customer. He came with Parmesan but he got nicer after (gave him a star) and gave us boxes for our food. I think the only good thing about this experience is how good the bread was lol"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous - I felt like I was back in NY at a casual storefront restaurant. I had the chicken marsala & it was delicious. My husband enjoyed the spaghetti & meatballs.  The staff was very good & attentive - which may be because we were right next to the kitchen.  The place is very small but one of the owners said they are in the process of expanding.  The only reason I gave them a 4 is because the garlic bread appetizer was not very good - kind of tasteless.  We are definitely going back & bringing friends."}
{"text":"Another great find . Real Italians making fresh pasta . The fresh portobello mushroom pasta was to die for. The meatball sub with home made meatballs was outstanding. Service was great as well as atmosphere .I highly recommend"}
{"text":"The best pasta ever!!!! I worked in a locally Italian owned pasta place growing up, I thought it was the best. Til I had this places food. Small place very busy. I've always gotten my food to go. I can see y it's always busy tho delicious!!!!! Angel hair pasta ala vodka sauce. idk I'm not Italian"}
{"text":"Got delivery through bite squad and it was great! Two salads (caesar and Mediterranean) and two pasta dishes (vodka sauce penne and spaghetti & meatballs) plus the Nutella cheesecake that was amazing! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Quite a gem in a nondescript strip mall. The chicken fettuccine was fabulous. Lasagne was fantastic. Each entree enough for two. Reasonable wine prices. Joe was great as well as the rest of the staff. Best Italian we have had in Vegas so far"}
{"text":"Chicken Parm was average, Pizza was ok, Rigatoni with peppers was ok, but nothing really amazing from the basic dishes we ordered.  The service wasn't even great, not very attentive. Worth noting, they have no kids meals and a simple bowl of pasta with butter plus a drink costs $10."}
{"text":"My family eats here regularly and have been coming since it opened. From the beginning, nothing but personable friendly people and AUTHENTIC Italian food. It's family owned and the family is so sweet and nice you feel like your in a bistro in Italy, the food is impeccable and portion size will definitely fill you up, I usually eat 3 times off of one serving. Definitely recommend it to anyone who loves Italian food!"}
{"text":"The mission was nearly impossible.  An affordable meal place that could please our small group of 7 or 8.  I looked and looked on Yelp for what seemed like hours.  Everything \"good\" was focused in the touristy areas.  And everything affordable was housed in buildings owned by chains.  But finally after messing with the maps and settings and filters on my iPhone app.  I finally found a place.  Spaghetty Western is a deli style Italian Restaurant.  It's got the deli counter and some four tops inside.  Imagine a small strip mall space.  It's not a fancy fine dining experience, but at no time did we have service that was anything less than high quality.  I had intended to write this review right away, but it's been a few months since we were in there.  So now many of the details have faded too much for me to fine tune my review down to dishes and the quality of food.  I apologize for this being a review that isn't up to my usual standards.  But I will toss out a few notes that I do remember.  veal saltimbocca was really good. Friendly and helpful! I think I double tipped.  Service added then I tipped 20% again!  And I honestly didn't care..the experience was well worth it! If I am in Vegas, I would go here before spending hundreds anywhere else."}
{"text":"One of my boyfriend and I's favorite spaghetti place in town! It's super close to our house. The food is so yummy and the garlic bread is to die for! I always get the penni pasta with marinara. So so so good! If you haven't checked this place out yet you have to try it! Mmmm makes my mouth water just talking about it hahah!"}
{"text":"Congratulations on your reopening and the beautiful addition. We enjoyed our dinner last night and appreciated the ambience of the new decor.  The meal was delicious. We had the lenticchie soup, cheese  raviolis, and the best capricio salad I've ever had. Even the mozzarella cheese was tasty (I usually find it very bland.)"}
{"text":"Went to this place last weekend with my family and was appalled by the explicit behavior displayed by the waiter towards a couple of female patrons who appeared to be rather intoxicated. The waiter was carrying on an inappropriately sexually gratuitous conversation with these women and putting his hands all over them. This is unacceptable behavior for a family restaurant. More shocking is that a man of his age should know better. To his credit the manager attempted to intervene but this made matter worse as the women seemed to be enjoying the attention and began running through the restaurant ending up in the kitchen. Despite the good food I would never recommend this restaurant to ANYONE with children."}
{"text":"The food is ok at best. This is the third time I have tried this place and I will not be coming back. The best part of the entire meal was the bread. My daughter ordered the kids penne pomodo and it was runny and watered down and the penned was over cooked. I ordered cappelli with tomato, basil and garlic. It was overcooked and there were 3 halved grape tomatoes and some finely chopped basil as garnish. My husband had chicken franchise and the sauce broke and his pasta was over cooked as well. Al dente! Pasta should never be mushy. Neither my husband or my daughter ate their desserts. My husband said the strawberry cheesecake was just nasty and my daughter took one bite of her cannoli. Service was super slow. And it took more than 15 minutes to get the change. Even as bad as it was, I always tip my server. It isn't an easy job. However the server should thank my husband he had small bills and left her a tip because I was completely annoyed. Our bill was $70.12 and I gave her $100. She asked if I wanted change! Really? She wasn't good. I drank my daughter's water because they didn't refill mine. I had planned to give her $15, but when she brought back the change, she gave me a $10 and a $20. Did she really think I would leave a $20? Or maybe she knew she wasn't great and I at least this way she would get $10. Either way, awful dining experience."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've ever had. Amazing service. Definitely gonna be a regular here."}
{"text":"Authentic as it gets! This scratch made Italian kitchen will have make your mouth water!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian. 120% nice presentation. Great menu and awesome service. Try the gelato and expresso together."}
{"text":"This has become one of favorite spots in Las Vegas for italian food. the food is just really good! it's a small crowded space and not really great for romantic dinners but it's wonderful for just a good tasting meal. I go there prob twice a week, their seafood fettuccini is the best."}
{"text":"My friend and I really liked this restaurant. We we're greeted by the owner and he checked on us throughout the evening. We had the calamari and it was excellent. It wasn't covered in breading - just enough and great seasonings too. And there we 3 or 4 large shrimp in the order too;) I had the lasagna and he had the spaghetti and meatballs. Lasagna was one of the best I've had. You can tell it was homemade and had lots of meat. I tried the meatballs and it was really good too. We shared a tiramisu for dessert and it was delicious! Overall it was a great dining experience and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"HOLY SHIT!!! Best Italian spot in Vegas! Every time I have been here the food has always been phenomenal, great customer service and happy smiling staff members that actually care. If I could give it 10 stars I would. Love that it's so close to my house. And they deliver.... What?????? I'm going to put on so much weight.... Worth it though! Yum!"}
{"text":"CLOSED FOR UPGRADES until at least 6/17/16......  Ok, so I've actually not eaten here because we showed up today from out of town and were saddened to see the restraint gutted and under construction. We were met by the nicest guy inside who turned out to be the owner and was super great. He was excited at their expansion and very apologetic for them being closed. Wish we lived closer than 6 hours away, I have a feeling we'd be regulars here. We make Vegas an annual trip so we're looking forward to trying again next year! (Ps: don't be remodeling next June!)"}
{"text":"Be cautious about this place!  Me and my sis have gone here like maybe twice but the last time we did was a huge mistake. I ordered the oven baked penne and my sis ordered the regular ole spaghetti and meatballs. This was at about 7pm. Three hours later my sister is violently ill with the works, my first thought and hers-food poisoning. This lasts until about 1 am she tells me. Fast forward and it is day 2 and she is still feeling nauseous with stomach cramping. I get that it's flu season but this meal was the defining factor- she was feeling great all day before eating here. Be careful. This is the first time we've eaten this food and gotten sick. My meal was apparently okay, but hers made her very sick and she is now afraid to eat this food ever again. We won't be back. Word of warning don't eat here if you don't want to be up sick all night."}
{"text":"To be fair we haven't eaten in the restaurant only had take out. The food was good, not great. I will definitely try this place again. I had the mushroom pappardelle (a little bland and I kept getting grit - mushrooms need to be washed better) and meatball sub. The salad they gave me with the sub was missing dressing. The bread they gave with the entree was stale."}
{"text":"Amazing selection. Completely authentic. Everything is super delicious and made to order. We get an immense amount of take out every time. Hence why I'm not skinny. But I'm happy. Seriously. Try this place  Family run!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, first time was July 2016 and it was fantastic. Service and food were top notch, restaurant was packed. Fast forward to most recent visit which was in October 2016 and the whole experience fell short. Many items on menu they were out of, service was not good and food was mediocre. Place was empty on a Saturday night so something changed....... Isn't worth the drive from where I live, many other places to try."}
{"text":"Best Italian spot in Las Vegas!! So much flavor. Highly recommend the butternut squash, lobster ravioli, and tiramisu!! Best tiramisu I've ever had !!!!!"}
{"text":"I love it here!! They spaghetti and meatballs is my absolute favorite...  Also the bolognese, the meat and cheese platter, the sandwiches, the tiramisu...  I have been her numerous times and everything that I have ordered has been delicious!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last week. We had take out... the kids and I just had the standard spaghetti and meatballs and my wife had a lasagna. It was very tasty with big portion sizes. We would definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"This review is going to be weird, because I've never stepped foot in to the restaurant... but hear me out.  If I want amazing pasta but don't want to leave my house I will order from here on postmates 10/10 times.  The food is always fresh, warm, and delicious. Their italian sausage is amazing and you can tell the quality of the ingredients by the flavors.   Please never change you crazy named restaurant. I love you the way you are now."}
{"text":"Sadly, I don't think we'll ever go back after tonight. The last several times I've ordered food to go, it has been wrong. Tonight we dined in and all 5 dishes we ordered came out at separate times. The first person to get theirs was nearly done by the time he last person was served. Additionally, two of the orders were wrong and one of those even came out wrong the second time. At no time did a manager or owner come over to check on our table or see what could be done about the mishaps. On the bright side, the food we were served was fairly tasty. I think this restaurant could be great, if they paid more attention to detail and customer satisfaction. They are pretty overpriced for what you get and could benefit from adjusting their prices."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to go for Italian food in the SW area. It took us two years of living right up the street to even realize what it was!  The food is excellent, but the ambiance and service is what really makes it awesome. The servers are always attentive and helpful. My wine glass is never empty and the food comes in perfect sequence.  We REALLY enjoyed a singer they had there one night who would seamlessly go from covers of 80s rock bands to modern pop... super cool. We have been back three times and will continue to visit in the future whenever we have a hankering for great pasta!"}
{"text":"I love having this place in our neighborhood. The food is always along the scale from great to excellent. The staff is friendly and accommodating, even when they are busy you can tell they try hard and really care. Sucks about the delivery being cancelled but you know how a few can ruin it for all."}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant. In fact I would tell all my friends about it. But for some reason, the last two times my husband and I were unimpressed with our meals. He got the antipasto and I got the gnocchi. My to-go portion was skimpy and I didn't get any garlic bread. My Caesar salad was underwhelming. I was disappointed that I chose this as my Mother's Day meal   *Update Since my review, David , the owner, reached out to me and offered to make right previous \"wrongs.\" I must say that this last meal was more like I remembered of past Spaghetty Western trips. The mushroom ravioli, antipasto, and the western salad were great. The veal was good. Thank you David for the chance to experience the Spaghetty Western I used to love. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Me and my husband love coming here! The fetunta is to die for and super cheap. And their tiramisu is probably the best I've ever had. Love love love everything about this place."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service! We had the bread is an appetizer and then I have the wonderful lasagna. Not too much meat but just perfect. Then we had the teramasu & the sherbet type filled orange. Left their uncomfortably full because all the food was so tasty!!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner there for the first time. WOW...It was absolutely delicious.   Lasagna was fantastic and my wife had the Penne with meat sauce.   Tiramisu was uniquely prepared and light as a feather. YUMMY  We will be back and bring friends too.  Alex our server was top notch."}
{"text":"Very good Italian joint.  When I first walked in I was taken-a-back by the minimalist design and small size.  I am glad we decided to sit down and give it a try.  Everything we tried was fantastic!  I had the meatballs and chicken parmigiana.  The portions are huge!  I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Great Italian eatery - good food - good atmosphere - decent prices - mom and pop shop - gem in southern highlands  - come in and enjoy"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I have never been disappointed not only with the service but the excellent quality in the food. I absolutely love the renovations done to the location. Keep it up!! I also recommend the vodka sauce fettuccini!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and I'm not really wowed. The owners and service is great. The menu is a little off kilter which I'm usually a fan of but the flavors don't really seem to do it for me.   My husband however and one of my co-workers are always asking me to go back there. They love it.   It's more of a northern Italian cuisine rather than the southern Italian I am usually used to.   The best thing on the menu is the butternut squash ravioli. It gets a 4. Try it. Everything else I tried: spaghetty western gets a 2. Meatball sandwich 3.   It's definitely different if you're not in the traditional Italian mood but are craving pasta. Still worth giving a shot."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years.  AWESOME food.  Service is more than exceptional with ALEX!  Ask for him!  You will not be disappointed.  When the place changed owners he is the reason we continued coming.  Go here!!! Yum yum"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pasta restaurants around! I have not been disappointed once! I love their signature dish, the \"Spaghetty Western.\" Their porchetta sandwich is Amazing! Each dish is flavorful and fresh. I love their tiramisu also. I prefer to pick up. The restaurant houses an interesting younger male crowd for some reason. It's like being in some machismo filled after gym restaurant in a locker room. We need more families and couples in this place."}
{"text":"Eggplant parm and the fisherman's linguini. Authentic, delicious. The spices are just right.  It's hard to please me when it comes to pasta.  This more than met my expectations. Deli style restaurant. No need to dress up. I can't wait to come back. What does Dave say?  Yum"}
{"text":"Well, came here for pick-up at around 7pm (2 orders of chicken marsala) for my girlfriend and I. As i was getting rdy to pay i witnessed the chef licking his fingers and touching the food for taste. ..nasty. Especially when i found out it was my food! I feel bad for the other people that are unknowingly making out with that guy.  The manager was nice but there is no way we'll be back."}
{"text":"I am very impressed with the owner of the establishment.    Good prices on food. Very nice decor inside.  Friendly staff.    Didn't give 5 stars due to cramped seating but it is a small place so that's to be expected."}
{"text":"So I'm letting you know I don't really care what kind of service I get because I am in the industry as long as your food backs up crappy service. We got amamzing service tonight and even if the service sucked I would come back for the food. This food is amazing get the sausage sandwich and the anti pasta. Stupid ridiculous food. I can't even believe how good this is."}
{"text":"Great service, super fast!!!. This is My second time here :), great for pasta and salads. They bake desserts everyday. The waiter even gave us lemon pie for free."}
{"text":"Spaghetty Western does not disappoint! Grub hub delivery was dependable and food was hot and yummy!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. Our first restaurant experience since moving to Vegas. Fabulous Starr who were attentive and kept my water glass full, which is always a plus for me. The calamari while expensive, was well worth the money. The pasta was delicious, freshly prepared and left a nice taste in my mouth. I will be bringing people here!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to write this review! We just left.. I just finished surgery and it was my first opportunity to have PASTA! Mangia!   Not so much.. I checked my cc ticket, 4:29 pm. We got our food at 5:05, to go, no less. (These are exact times!) no one told us our food would take a while... Watching 10 people come in and get their food! A little communication people! For two people our bill w/ tip was 50.00! Not to slam anyone as we haven't tried our food.. Yet. Why??? BECAUSE WE HAVE ZERO UTENSILS OR NAPKINS in our to go bag!! I'm starving! If this food isn't good... Lisa our manicurist is going to hear an earful!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. They have a lunch special menu for $10.99 an entree!! Im not sure if its Mon - Friday only or Mon - Sun you'll have to double check. While you wait for your food to be made they give you fresh warm bread that taste homemade but I'm not sure if it is or isn't anyway its delicious .I got the pink vodka with angel hair pasta and chicken and it was sooooo good. I am for sure going back for more. My husband got the Fettuccine Chicken Alfredo and wasn't to hype about it because it wasn't creamy enough for him."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to come here for lunch since it was close to where he lived. Also, I've been meaning to try this place out but because it was still really new when I heard about this place, there wasn't a whole lot of information. I didn't know what exactly they had on their menu. Well, today, I found out!   They had a bunch of different things on the menu ranging from meats, cheeses, sandwiches, and pastas. I LOVE pasta so we don't have to guess which category I looked at!  I ended up going with a Penne Arribbiata while the boyfriend went with their Spaghetty Western. When we went to order it, this gentlemen, with a very THICK accent, took down our order and asked us what we liked it about it. He warned me that my pasta was spicy but I LOVE spicy so of course I wouldn't have a problem! I think after that, I just nodded at what he said cause I couldn't really make it out. He said something about olives and I just said, \"I'm fine with that.\" I'm not sure if the olives were an add on or it came with it ... but if you were to order something, pay extra close attention to what he's saying! He's really nice though!  When I ate my pasta ... oy boy! It was spicy!! It wasn't alarmingly spicy but if you can't handle spicy foods, I wouldn't suggest it. It was very good. It had enough kick in it for me but the spiciness didn't burn. The penne that I chose with it was al dente, which is exactly how I like my pasta :) The serving sizes are pretty big too. I actually didn't finish my pasta so at least I have left overs for lunch the next day! Also, a piece of garlic bread comes with the pasta!   The ONLY thing I didn't really like was it took a while to get the food. We had ordered it to go so we were just waiting and waiting.   But I would definitely come back to this place !!"}
{"text":"My goodness the food is good. I ordered the lasagna and garlic bread to go. First of all they gave me something the hostess said was a step above garlic bread (and I wish I remembered the name), but holy cow it was delicious!!! You already know it's an amazing review if I have no food left to take a picture of. Excuse me while I go into a deliciousness coma. WILL DEFINITELY GO BACK!"}
{"text":"After reading all of these 5 star reviews, I must admit that we were rather underwhelmed with the food we ordered for take out. It was at best on par with Olive Garden which in my opinion is a fast food quality Italian restaurant. While the angel hair pasta and marinara in our Chicken Parmesana meal was pretty good, the chicken was nothing more than a baked pre-made frozen breaded chicken breast.  That theme continued with the cheese pizza which again was simply a pre-made crust that essentially tasted like a Celeste frozen pizza. Even the garlic bread was just a bland tasting piece of buttered roll with some parsley sprinkled on it.   The only thing that brings my review up a star was the fact that our food was ready within 20 minutes even though it was 6pm on a Saturday. The person taking my phone order and at the counter was both prompt and friendly. Based on the price for the quality of food received, we will not return."}
{"text":"I hope this does not sound condescending, but I am giving this restaurant a 1 star because I care and want them to succeed. I see potential in this place, but only if this hard-working family can straighten some issues that need immediate attention:  Service: This was the deal breaker for us. We do not know the name of the lady serving us, and that is because she was not wearing a name tag. In fact, she was not wearing much of a professional attire to serve her customers...yoga pants, a very lose fitting blouse/gym top and dirty gym shoes definitely left a lot to be desired. Here is a list of no-no's we experienced in our visit:   * No greeting when we first came in   * We sat ourselves and 5-10 minutes went by before she acknowledged us...and there were only 3 tables sat at the time   * This lady was flustered and all over the place. She even complained to us about a table (that had a half-finished bottle of wine to go) of 6 people wouldn't leave.   * Her demeanor was curt and, sometimes rude. We spent 40+ minutes waiting for two dishes and we did not checked up on. Our drinks ran dry, no bread was brought to our table, no apology was given! About 50 minutes after ordering she comes to our table to, again, complain about how the kitchen was handling the to-go and eat-in tickets like that was, somehow, our problem. Towards the end of our meal she promised we would get our drinks for free because of the wait, but then she charged us for them!  * To top it all of, just as we were done eating, she tells us from behind the counter \"Hey, your total comes to $40.70 and I have your ticket pulled up here at the register. No hurry\"... HOW RUDE!!! We felt compelled to abruptly end our meal and go to the register to pay. She then has the nerve to ask us how much tip we are leaving her because her register does allow to put the tip after the ticket was printed. Really?!? If this is the case... then get a new register!  Kitchen Staff: Very disorganized! Some things we saw:   * A tall guy in the kitchen with shoulder-length hair kept running his fingers through his hair without washing his hands   * One of the line cooks handled tip money without washing his hands afterwards   * The server would clean tables and then dish the garlic bread with her bare hands   Food: Average at best. My linguini with white wine clam sauce was bland and 'boring' and my girlfriend's pasta with vodka sauce was just ok. Seasoning and flavor profile could be a lot better.  If an owner is reading this, please:  * Deploy your staff and give them specific responsibilities, so they don't run around like chickens with their heads cut off.   * Get a friendlier server for the front  * Observe hand-washing guidelines per the health department  * Ensure you have enough staff to meet the customer demand  * Ensure you have a system in place to serve the dine-in customers first, then take care of the delivery/carryout orders.  * Fix your charcuterie display. You have a $5000 refrigerated display with some old-looking food and chunks of meat thrown in there. You can do better.  Anyways... if you had the patience to read through all this and you are a possible customer, I hope you have a better experience. And, if you work here, please make it better!"}
{"text":"I have eaten a metric ton of Italian food in my lifetime and I can say, without a doubt, hands down the best Italian -Bar None- I have ever had has been here at the Spaghetty Western Get the Speck. Get it with fettuccine, and die happy! Great good, better people, get here now!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  The food is always tasty and never goes to waste.  We have sampled a bit of everything from the menu, and have yet to be disappointed by anything.  Even ordering food to go does not disappoint."}
{"text":"This is in the rotation for the husband and I but this last visit was awful.  Nobody answered the phone so I couldn't place my order to go. 35 minute wait after order was placed, which I understand you get busy. But I order my favorite get home only to realize that they forgot menu listed ingredients. What a bummer."}
{"text":"We were craving a Italian food and found this small local spot. We walked in and were greeted by the the host who sat us down right in front of the bar area. The place was quite small but spacious. We ordered the mussels for appetizers which were good but I should've ordered the clams. For dinner we ordered the spaghetti with meatballs, the Bobbi ( I added chicken) and lobster ravioli. Before dinner and appetizers, they brought us a basket of warm bread and olive oil to dip. The dinner later came and apparently they forgot to add the chicken to my plate (the Bobbi) but he server brought it after and told  me he wasn't going to charge me for the inconvenience. With that said, I got to say that the service was great! They were very attentive and welcoming. Overall I would definitely come back here again and recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here hearing about this place but never checking it out....finally got the time to and we ordered:   The Bobbi - Super savory with the specks of prosciutto and sun dried tomatoes. Sooo good it just sucks that the portion is smaller than what I would normally eat. However for a normal person it would be just enough.  Francese - Lightly egg battered chicken with lemon butter sauce. Again sooo good but my fatass can eat both items.   This is really a hidden gem as both items we had were done really well in an area you wouldn't expect this great of food would come from."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch due to limited options near the clinic.   They have a $14.95 lunch special for any pasta with a salad and drink. I chose a hot chocolate with the house salad and lobster ravioli. The hot chocolate was served with steamed milk and I never appreciated hot chocolate so much before. The only downside is that they use package hot chocolate. The house salad was heavy on olives but still less plain than other house salads plus it came with bread. The lobster ravioli was the most disappointing. It was bland despite the looks."}
{"text":"Really good subs. The meat is imported and you can tell the quality of food. The people are friendly especially the older Italian guy. I highly recommend this place for lunch. I haven't eaten dinner there but the pasta dishes look amazing."}
{"text":"Went here on a wim since it was new and I was craving some pasta.  It's not a super nice place, tables are kind of small and shaky but not a deal breaker.  You can either order up front or just have a seat a waitress eventually comes by.    There were a few other people there so we decided to dine in.  We ordered the anti pasto, Linguine Fisherman, & Arribata sauce pasta with chicken.  The serving size is quite generous and they give you a huge piece of garlic bread.  The taste was not bad either!  Pricing is about average, not crazy expensive (think Olive Garden pricing).    We go back or maybe order to go again definitely!   The only thing is that the wait was a little longer for the anti pasto and I guess there's only one deli guy who alsp works the cash register which is why it's slow?"}
{"text":"Milena and her husband's restaurant #spaghettywestern is the place to get your Italian food!!! Everything is freshly prepared with the best ingredients flown from Italia! You can just tell this place has the best home-made everything Italian/Sicilian. A little slice of Sicily in the SW part of LV. The involvitini served with angel hair was delicioso as was the chicken piccata. Grazie!! #italianfood #doppio"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Friendly staff! Great service. My husband and I eat here quite often and we have yet to be disappointed!"}
{"text":"How is it possible that we have a spot this good, and this unique, this far out in the Southern Highlands suburbs? It's a legit Northern Italian deli, whose wares in that department are best enjoyed in a misto platter - three meats and two cheeses chosen by you and paired with olives, artichokes and red pepper - or on a sandwich.  Although I prefer the hot sandwiches. The meatballs are made with the perfect smooth mildness to contrast with the cut of the sauce and the creaminess of the cheese. My go-to menu item here is the chicken parm sandwich - which may be, honest to god, the best example of this simple dish that I've ever had. Just perfection.  Everything's super fresh, made to order, created with obvious love. What did we do to deserve you?"}
{"text":"They give you a lot for a very good price. Its not like the bad italian food from Olive Garden its the legit kind of italian food like authentic food"}
{"text":"I stopped by on my lunch break to try it out. I had the Hang em High sandwich with chips and drink, it came out to about $13. Its a little on the expensive side, but I can understand that since you can tell they use really high quality ingredients as well as the fact that they're big enough to share. And just a warning, don't order that particular sandwich unless you really like gorgonzola cheese, they spread a very generous amount on. The staff was very friendly, and over all it is a really nice little spot. I will definitely return to try other items."}
{"text":"amazing customer service !! loooooove everyone here and the food is sooooooo yummy yay come here everyone! ps:try the tortellini with four cheese sauce!!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Order lasagna the best in a long time. Fettuccini was great and shrimp scampi was great!!! Dario our server was great!!"}
{"text":"First time dining here. We were promptly greeted and seated in a cozy, round corner booth.   Our server, Peggy, was quick to take our order. I noticed from neighboring tables that the portions looked hefty, so my wife and I shared penne with Bolognese sauce and a Caesar salad.   The food was good, but not exceptional (3 star). The service, however, was excellent.  The staff works as a team to ensure you always have what you need. We had three different people making sure our water and tea never went empty.   Kudos to Peggy and her colleagues for their attentive service. It really made a difference in our dining experience."}
{"text":"First let me say that I'm so excited this place finally opened!  Today I went in and the staff was very friendly and helpful!I ordered my food (spaghetti w/meat sauce) to go and it was really good! While i was waiting they provided me with a sample plate of prosciutto and cheese... so yummy! The prosciutto was soft and light and not too salty and it blended with the cheese so delightfully!   The only downside which is part of working out the kinks is there was no plastic wear or napkins in the to-go bag. That's half my fault for not asking.  Also wished they had a green house salad but they don't :(  All in all very happy to have them as part of the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I came back for the second time and tried the desserts, I had the cream puff, angel cake, and parfait. It was delicious. I enjoyed it immensely, it was possibly the best dessert i have ever had. If you are thinking about coming here, don't bother debating, it is a definite yes. Thank you for taking the time to read this, thank you.  -Laberta"}
{"text":"In the words of the old classic TV show \"In Living Color\"    \"Don't nobody better say nuthin bout my FAVORITE local restaurant Spaghetty Western, cause that's when I will go off!\"   No seriously this is a very well put together restaurant/bar with amazing happy hour food, a friendly staff and surprisingly authentic atmosphere. Oh & the food, that food......."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem, awesome authentic service and the food is awesome. Great if your in the mood for a drink or craving some authentic Italian"}
{"text":"The Cioppino, Diavlos, lobster ravs and much more ate led than a mile from the crib.  I think I was a bit harsh on the place the first go around,  but that's the beauty of Yelp, it's like a religion...there's always time to repent.  I have grown to love this spot and the staff are legit.  We just got done exchanging baby pics with one of the Italian ladies and had a nice chat, nothing prying or to revealing, but a genuine conversation that raised my awareness of how personable the staff is.   Although the dining area is puny, it's comfortable and gives you that cozy feeling that you are eating right in their home.  Don't forget to wash down your main entree with a tall glass if Peroni and check out the traditional deli and desserts.  Grazi Spaghetty Western!"}
{"text":"The best Italian food in Vegas! Authentic food and employees. Would give 10 stars if I could. Love this place"}
{"text":"Just ordered a take out tonight to try this place for the first time. Opened the box and was a little underwhelmed at the portion for the Lobster Ravioli with Alfredo, but because it smelled so heavenly....I figured I would eat first before making any decisions.   OMG - Goodness!! The rich sauce and ravioli explain why the portion was a little on the smaller side..the box does it no justice! Ravioli's are stuffed with lobster and the alfredo was by far one of the best I have had and it has to be the quality of ingredients they use.  Take out time was quick and friendly..great service! I will be back and appreciate the advantage of having you so close to home!"}
{"text":"Good local Italian place.  Family run and some really nice people.  The food here is made to order and it shines through. We ordered three different dishes and the best of the bunch was not on the menu.  We ordered the meatloaf, the chicken Alfredo and the \"bobbi\".    All three were good but the \"bobbi\" was fantastic. I will order it next time we go there for sure."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are huge foodies. We have been to every amazing restaurant in Las Vegas and this place is top notch! Best calamari and lasagna I have ever had in my entire life. Every dish was a knock out of the park. I hate Fettuccini Alfredo and when I tried my guys I was blown away. I would order it as my entree. The seating is limited so call ahead. We spoke to the owner (who is a complete doll) and he told us they are in the process of expanding. Really really impressed."}
{"text":"Not bad... But not good. I could've gotten better from Olive Garden at half the price.  My order was wrong after waiting patiently for more than an hour."}
{"text":"My husband describes this place as \"Legit Italian,\" I'm in agreement there.  We've ordered from them twice and the food is so good.  Big portions, so you have more than a meal coming to you with an entree.  Fresh food, good quality products used, and everyone there is very friendly and welcoming.  Eat it.  It's good."}
{"text":"Went to Spaghetty Western last night for the first time with a friend. We walked in and were seated instantly. Our server came by with a basket of delicious (but super soft) bread and got drink and appetizer orders. When she came back, she got our food orders. I order spaghetti & meatballs and he ordered a meatball sub (his came with a salad or soup).   So our mozzarella sticks arrived and they were AMAZING. Oh my gosh, like super delicious. Apparently they make them fresh there, not frozen ones. But then our food came and they brought his sandwich before his salad, which was weird. My pasta was good, but I guess the meatballs were a little lackluster. They could have used some more seasoning and maybe cooking a little longer. They weren't raw or pink inside, but they also just didn't seem well cooked, if that makes sense.   The place itself is pretty cute. A mixture of tables and booths...we sat in a corner booth with a view of the whole place. There were movie posters on the wall and a bar area in the main seating area. In the little area where you walk in, it's more like a pick up counter (and has their dessert case).   Our servers were good. The main one was very friendly, and her assistant brought stuff out pretty quickly. He was also good on filling up our drinks again.  Overall, mostly good experience. I don't think I'd order the meatballs again, but that's just because I like mine a bit more well done."}
{"text":"Huge portions, great food, and friendly service. Get the side house salad; for four dollars it is a steal. We all left happy and had enough left for a midnight snack."}
{"text":"Had the Pescatore and it was so good definitely something that I would crave...the waitress was really nice also...good service overall"}
{"text":"The pasta here just HOLDS YOU after eating it. Feel like a million dollars after eating here everytime. Alex and Johnnie are amazing bartenders and the Bloody Mary mix was incredible! HIGHLY recommended on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. Lunch special was only $10.99 for salad, pasta/soup too! I love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. The food is amazing and ingredients are fresh.   The CALABRESE sandwich is the bomb.  Provolone, Capocollo, Soppressata, Banana Peppers, Lettece, Tomatoes, and onion.   Thank me later."}
{"text":"As far as I'm concerned, this is the best Italian food I've ever had. I've had a lot too!! I always get the portobello ravioli special, but I did try the butternut squash raviolis too. Both were amazing. Everyone I take there wants to go back. This may sound strange but I'm looking to buy a house and I hope I don't move too far from this place. Whether you dine in or take it to go, this place will not disappoint. Everything made fresh. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had the worst experience ever at a restaurant. I walked into the newly renovated Spaghetti Western to be passed by employees for 5-minutes before being acknowledged. They sat me on the new side. Several minutes later a bus boy asked if I had been helped. A tall lanky waiter came to serve me. Eventually placed my order for my chicken Parmesan. The waiter asked if I wanted a soup or salad. I asked what kind of soups, like minestrone. He said no, we have lentil but no minestroney, like a 5 year old. I thought that I was at an Italian restaurant?! I asked what do they put on the salad, he said tomatoes, black olives, cheese, stuff like that. Stuff like that?! Wtf.   The food itself was great. The service sucked. I got my check and realized that the soup or salad that the waiter offered was a full salad that wasn't included in the meal?! Omg, why offer it and not tell the customer it's an additional fee?!   Dinner for one person came out to $40?! There was no alcohol. One desert. And a lot of horrible service. I begrudgingly tipped hoping that the bus boy would receive it."}
{"text":"Really good food at reasonable prices. Small place. Nice service and family owned it seems like. The pasta that comes with the eggplant parm is delicious, though the eggplant parm was small."}
{"text":"Pasta is perfect. I have had the grilled plate two times awesome grilled vegetables and 3 grilled meats. Yummy garlic bread. Love the desserts too."}
{"text":"5 stars for Jonny. She is awesome we have been here multiple times now and she is on point with everything. Her drinks are so great her customer service is so great  as well!"}
{"text":"One word to describe the food, service and facilities... AWESOME! The server was very attentive, the food was to die for and the facilities were clean, romantic and perfect for a date night. The background music level was perfect, enough to drown out the conversations of other diners but low enough to carry on a conversation at your own table. I would recommend it for anyone. The prices were very reasonable and the portions were right sized. While the wine and drink list isn't overly large it's right sized for the establishment. It's kid friendly, family oriented yet also intimate enough for dates"}
{"text":"After reading a review on a Facebook group, we decided to take the kids and check this place out, and let me tell you, we were not disappointed!!!   Ordered the Antipasto Misto. For dinner: Spaghetti Western,  Cioppino, Chicken Alfredo, and Pizza. For dessert, Cannoli's and Tiramisu  We have now found a new, close to home favorite!  The younger chef, you can tell has a lot of passion about his cooking.  Can't wait to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Although this location is a little out of the way (for most people living in or visiting Vegas, I highly recommend this restaurant.  It's a little hidden gem. The food here is delicious and reasonably priced with large portions, and our server was fantastic.   I highly recommend the garlic bread, which is crisp and delicious. I had the meatball sub for dinner and it was good, but the bread ended up a little soggy. Everyone else ordered pasta plates and all seemed to enjoy them.  The restaurant is tiny, so either get there early, or call and see if they do reservations (I don't know if they do).  My family declared it a hit!  I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Our family eats here just about every other week for dinner, and my husband and I frequently enjoy a really nice date night here as well. The waitstaff are so attentive and we've gotten to know several of them by name now.   The restaurant is fairly small, and if you decide to come on a weekend, be prepared to wait 30+ minutes for a table. However very much worth the wait!   The wine selection is above & beyond anything in the area. The Duckhorn wine flight is one of our favorites. The salads are great, very fresh and the dressings are flavorful. I highly recommend the pastas (especially the bolognese)...but we really come here for the garlic bread. We usually order 2 of them because it's devoured so quickly. It's simply AMAZING!!! And the cannoli for dessert. Yum.  It's very affordable for a family meal and really great for a social date night. A secret spot of ours on the southwest side of town that we don't mind sharing. Love!"}
{"text":"I ordered to go, the penne vodka with prosciutto garlic and sundried tomatoes and the pappardelle porcini.  The pappardelle was delicious!  I'd order that again and again and again.  If you like mushrooms, you would love this dish."}
{"text":"I love this little hole in the wall restaurant. Their red sauce is legit and carbonara is the real deal. I live near Boulder City and gladly drive to Southern Highlands to visit this place."}
{"text":"This place us a hidden gem! The owners are Italians so they-know-spaghetti! Their portions are great, and their taste us superb.   The selection in cured meats and cheeses is very authentic and the atmosphere is very easy. If you want to have an Italian dish without the hassle of an expensive place or the repetitiveness if a franchise, this us the place! You will never go wrong.   Per un'autentica esperienza!"}
{"text":"Totally different experience upon returning. Food and service both much better this go around. Glad I gave them another chance."}
{"text":"Just went to go my favorite Carbonara and the tasty meatball spaghetti to serve our crave!  But both are way tooooo salty that we can't even force ourselves to swallow it! And the sauce of Carbonara is not right today, either!  The only thing that tastes the same is the meatball! Big disappointment for our long time next door favorite shop, and I don't think if I would take a risk to damage my kidneys in the future"}
{"text":"We went back and we have an amazing time the young lady server was very attentive knowledgeable even helping other tables. The food was pretty good hot in temperature good flavor.the tortelinis was really good  Nice little place family own n cozy we love to support small business.  Ez to park"}
{"text":"It's pretty good for a neighborhood restaurant. Service is very friendly. They serve good size portions."}
{"text":"For my birthday we decided to check this place out and get the food to go...my family and I placed an order and it was ready pretty quick...the upsetting part was the really bad to-go packaging...I am a vegetarian (and specialty asked that about the dish I ordered)...sad to say when we got home with the food, the two meat and seafood dishes had leaked their sauce all over the bag and into the other containers...with mine being on the bottom it was full of meat and fish sauce...we called the place and explained what happened and they were willing to replace the dish, but that meant that my father went back to pick it up, my mom ate hers while it was hot and by the time my dad was home with my new dish, his food was cold...so basically my dinner with the family was ruined as we didn't get to eat together..."}
{"text":"3.75 stars  The first question I asked, \"Do you have turkey?\".  After I got a continuous earful with a strong Italian accent that was barely understood....he went on and on about what they do have.  The long and short of it, they don't.   It's not an Italian market, but it is a true Italian deli.  They don't have boars head like a typical place.  SW is more befitting to locals. I wouldn't go out of my way.  It looks like a deli, not a restaurant.  Meatball Sandwich ================ Presentation - 5.0 stars.  It measured 8-9 inches.  Uncut, and beautiful.  Pick-up Ability - 1.0 stars.  It was mush in my hands.  Too much sauce.  This doesn't happen at Capriotti's!  Meatballs (3.0 stars) - Heavy, not bready enough to be light.  Sauce (2.0 stars) - a sharp taste, like vinegar.  Cheese (5.0 stars) - wonderful quality of both parm and mozzarella.   Bread (5.0 stars) - amazing.  Toasty and fresh.  Talkative, but a very nice man.  Lasagne looks great, and huge slices at that.  It might be worth giving them another try, even though the sauce was questionable...it could've been a bad batch."}
{"text":"It takes a lot for me to be dissatisfied.  I've never had an experience at a restaurant as horrible as this one. This was my first time at this restaurant and I'll never eat here again.   We waited 45 minutes to be seated for a group of 5 people they initially told us it'll be about 15 minutes. Not a big deal. We finally sat down and ordered. We ordered a bruschetta for our appetizer. We waited 30 minutes for the brushetta to come out. While we were waiting we saw people's food orders that were sat AFTER us coming out. NOT GOOD. They literally fed tables of 3 or less people first, before starting on our order. NOT GOOD. After waiting an hour and a half our food started trickling in. First the lasagna and two carbonaras. 10 minutes later the pesto pasta. I ordered a chicken marsala and it never came. IT NEVER CAME. Our waiter apologized and said he'll get that started immediately. The owner came and apologized and she explained to me that they recently expanded and she had to fire 7 workers. If you are that short staffed why stay open? I'm SOO disappointed.   My friends let my taste their food.  The lasagna was greasy. The carbonara was delicious  The pesto pasta was good."}
{"text":"The food was very good; but the service, and by service I only mean the wait for the food was wayyy too long. we were there at like 730pm last wed (4/8/15) and were warned that they couldn't handle the busy-ness very well. they did give us bread and marinara dipping sauce during our wait. the food was VERY good when it finally came and they offered us free desert for our trouble which I thought was nice. we will come back next time we visit las vegas for sure,"}
{"text":"I have to stop here every time I go to Vegas! The food is incredible and the customer service and atmosphere is like no other. You should show up early and stay late because when lunch and dinner come around it packs out quick ! The bar is always coming up with new drinks and they've perfected the classic ones. Anything from the appetizers to entrees will leave you happy and full. I always have food to take home! I love when they have live music and their bathroom soap is homemade. It seriously left my hands soft for 3 day's. Speaking of.. I need that recipe..."}
{"text":"This place is good! I mean, real good. Food is always consistent here. Delicious American Italian food east coast style if there is such a thing. Stay away from the soups and salads and just get to the heart of the menu. The appetizers, pastas and entrees. All sensational and their red sauce is divine. You can't beat the happy hour either - $4 drinks! Must have some dessert. The best tiramisu in town. I love that there is more lady fingers than mascarpone. Vegetarian friendly.  I get the meatballs to go (without the sauce) for my dogs. They love it but note there is garlic and onion in there so I only give a tiny bit. I met the owner, charming guy from NJ. Says he knows he missed out on money because he didn't add gaming but to be frank - that's why I like it! I'm more upset that he's an Eagles fan! If you're lucky to get Joe as a server you are in for a great meal from start to finish. This is a place that you should drive across town for at least once to try it."}
{"text":"Any time I meet my OG for dinner it's always great fun, even better when he's treating me to celebrate my birthday! We were debating where to eat and he randomly mentioned spaghetti western in another context not realizing it was the name of a restaurant in town. We took that as a sign from the food gods that it was time for pasta.  The restaurant is very small, good for takeout and they have a very small dining room where we took a seat and perused the menu. I ordered the pappardelle and my friend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.   The pasta was perfectly cooked and al dente. The flavors were balanced and I enjoyed every bite of my dish. We both scraped our plates clean.  If Spaghetty Western was anywhere near where I live I would be there regularly. Despite the distance, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Update!!!!  Just got their liquor license!!!!!! Dinner just got better!  We love this place and so happy they just expanded! Order the Bobbi penne pasta. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"We had take out for Valentines Day. To be fair it was take out and perhaps it is better in person because I know people do love this place. I just feel that the dishes we came home with were too Americanized. I am sad it is so hard to find an Italian restaurant who actually make their own pasta especially long pasta. That would make all the difference in the world."}
{"text":"We love this place!! Amazing authentic Italian food & they're expanding to make more room. $5 off coupons on the back of smiths grocery receipts too:-))"}
