{"text":"Ugh. Cesspool of a college bar, the only place at which I was ever, as far as I can tell, overtly discriminated against on the basis of (perceived) sexual orientation.

I stopped in for a quick happy hour drink with two friends, one a lesbian, one bisexual; all three of us \"look\" non-heterosexual to a certain extent. Anyway, we paid for this; the old guy tending bar pointedly ignored us, at one point literally ignoring our polite \"Excuse me\"s to wait on a cute blonde in the OTHERWISE EMPTY BAR. 

I am not eager to ever return."}
{"text":"The entire place smells like a bathroom. If they could remedy that with a constant flow of fresh oxygen, then one's mind could open to discover the joys of bar games and mason jar long islands."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! My fiance took 2 straws to put in my drink and this dumb bartender kicks him out for no reason! Worst customer service and bartender with the bald head and glasses ever! I highly do not recommend this place. There's better places that can gladly take your business"}
{"text":"Just like hangin back in your grand-pappy's shed in Pewalkee. Bring your cousins, a lawn chair, and an unquenchable thirst for giant-sized long islands in mason jars. 

$7.50 for some serious liquor is a steal, and they're cheaper the earlier you get there. This bar is cash only, so plan ahead."}
{"text":"Someone said it already but long islands.  Yeah like this used to be the local after-work tavern 6 years ago.  Just dive as fuck packed with dudes who like to tussle or act like they tussle.

Shit hole.  But comfy in its own pathetic way."}
{"text":"Had a great time.  Reminded me of O Street (Lincoln, NE) bars on game day.  Tough to get a drink but somehow still worth the wait to get in.  Visited Friday night before the Nebraska game and it was filled with Husker fans.  Saturday night it was not quite as hospitable as Wisconsin students had a day long bender under their collective belt."}
{"text":"Terrible Bar.  Smells like a dirty locker room.  The bar tenders are rude.  The drinks are terrible and when you ask for a new one they call you a drunk and argue with you about it.  Bathrooms are the most disgusting room I have ever been in.  If you go there do not use them.  Only good thing is that music isn't overly loud."}
{"text":"The only thing I like about this place is the massive $7 long-islands, other than that this place doesn't really do it for me. It is constantly crowded with angry people who just want to fight. They have some good drink specials but nothing to shout over aside from the long-islands. Atmosphere is just dirty, no real-theme to the place and staff is very rude."}
{"text":"I had *ONE* Long Island Iced Tea... the best long island I have ever had.... 

The rest, as they say, was history (history best forgotten and never ever talked about.)"}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: yeah, it's what I'd imagine drinking in a shed would be like.

I love the Red Shed. Long Islands. Foosball. Pool (free on Mondays). Darts. Seating for weary (or drunken) legs. TVs. Even the bro-iest of bros get a little more laid back when they walk in. It's a respite for the imbibers among us from the blackouts on State and University."}
{"text":"The normal bar tender that works there was rude twice going there with over 50  year old women.  He said what do you want me to get up. I can see why the bar was empty when we came in because he would not stand up out of his lazy chair.    Horrible person and horrible service.  Good luck w buisness bars around you serve 50 year old woman on a girls night w 28 year olds."}
{"text":"Four stars is the rating for Red Shed as a dive bar.  If you were comparing this to all eating/drinking establishments, it would probably get a single star for filthiness.  But a spotless and pristine dive bar would lack authenticity.

I came in with a friend on Badger gameday and somehow we lucked into bar stools 4 ft from the TV.  There are quite a few TVs mounted around the bar but they wouldn't be confused with the giant walls of viewing provided at newer style sports pubs. 

The beer choices were not extensive but I found some tasty local options.  My friend dove right into the giant mason jar LITs.  It has been a long time since I ordered one myself, but I actually joined him in the second half of the game.  I don't think they have as much kick as a LIT made from scratch, but at that volume, that isn't a terrible thing.

I was a bit hesitant to order much food because of the general grungyness but we did get a basket of fries - which turned out to be fantastic.  It was a good portion with nice flavor and cooked on point.  We also didn't want to spend cash on food because I was worried that we would run out of money for more beer.  This is only a concern because this a cash-only bar!  That's kind of a bummer.  They do have an ATM machine but I heard other bar patrons complain that is was broken.  I would prefer to have them tell me it's cash only when I order my drinks until after they were already in the glass.

If you haven't spent any time on constructions sites, you might be a little alarmed by the smell in the bathroom.  It reminded me of the odor you would find in a truck stop mens' room crossed with a newly decomposing body.  It is also very tight for two people so there was a line earlier in the afternoon.  As the day wore on, people stopped caring and just doubled up.

The bartenders were pretty awesome and straight forward.  There was a blond bartender (I think her name was Nichole) who was especially helpful and engaging.  That's not easy to do when you are dealing with the game day crows.  I really loved one part of the day when a young preppy couple came in and asked for Mimosa's.  One of the new bartenders had a look on his face that said \"what?\".  They ended up with screwdrivers instead!  :  )"}
{"text":"Normally a great dive bar. Bartenders were rude for no reason... We ordered, we tipped, why are you swearing at me?"}
{"text":"I have been told to never venture into their stinky, gross bathrooms. But, let us herald the 2.00 Spotted Cow brews from the Red Shed Tavrn and the fact that you can find a seat with it not being as jam packed as Wando's. With a short distance walk from the chicken and fish fry truck for a late night snack, 'tis not too bad of a place. Though the name is rhyming, it doesn't have the uniqueness of a Dr. Seuss book, but is average oooh."}
{"text":"Love this place. no, it's nothing fancy but when you have some of the best long islands in town you don't need to be fancy. everything is pretty straightfoward. it's a bar/pub. you can't beat it. PLUS foosball? game on."}
{"text":"After spending $40 dollars on a round of drinks plus a $10 dollar tip the bar tender about 5'8\" white military cap called me a a group of patrons a bunch of fucking losers. We are all in our mid twenties just walked in the bar . I questioned him on why he thought that and he got irate. Stay away!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 if i could. If you're looking for something a little more low key, not filled with college kids, that has a chill vibe you found the right place. Besides the fact that it is a cash only bar...which i hate, it has very cheap drinks ($4 well drinks and $5.50 for double shots) its definitely a place just filled with charm and good for a night out with friends for good convo, foosball, or darts. 

Happy Drinking!"}
{"text":"I've been going here a lot(pretty much a regular you could say.) It's a good place to include in your bar hopping plans. Wandos too busy? Fooseball taken at Vintage? Swing by Red Shed. It's also one of the few bars you can actually have a conversation at some  nights. One of my minor complaints is the jukebox. If there is no songs playing..it's just that--quiet. And at certain points in the night, you can hear a pin drop. Lines for the bathroom is sometimes annoying and I've felt really bad for the ladies here who have sometimes waited 30 minutes before the line moved one person :P"}
{"text":"This place is no more than a 'Sconnie feel college bar.  Gameday packed with locals and tourists alike... good times had by all.

Drinks were more than fair priced- and the Long Island Iced Teas will do a wicked number on you!"}
{"text":"The definition of a dive bar, and not saying that in a bad way. Sure, the bathrooms are putrid and the place stinks a little, but there's no lines and you can grab a drink much faster than any of the surrounding bars on the weekends (unless there's a hockey game or something going on). Good Long Islands and drink specials during the week."}
{"text":"Came here for the \"best Long Island in town\". Turns out it's not. They use a store bought mix for starters. Apparently they've never heard of mixing a real drink. They also used way too much sweet n sour. 

Tldr: Store bought mix. Too much sweet n sour."}
{"text":"So horrible. Worst service and a shit hole. Dirty and slobs all over. Rudest staff I have ever seen."}
{"text":"3 or 4 stars?  I can't decide.  I'll dole out a on-the-high-side-of-3-stars rating...mostly because I won't go here most evenings.  And when I go here, it's almost never my idea.

The Red Shed is a remarkable blend of Dive and Douche.  It's only Douche because it's around the corner from Wando's, so said people trickle in for cheap drinks high in alcohol content.  If this bar were located anywhere else, it would be a backwoods, \"everyone's packin' heat\"-kind of bar.  

They have $6 mason jar long islands.  They will f up your s.  That said, you shouldn't visit Madison without getting your s f'd up by drinking one of these bad boys.  Wisconsinites really know the best and quickest routes to becoming alcoholics.

The service is always nice and fairly prompt.  There's a 'big game hunting' game to add to the ambiance.  The music is okay sometimes.  BUT....and it's a big but.....avoid the bathroom.  It is a mix between a very small, dark prison cell and the toilet from Trainspotting.

Oh, oh!  But the best part is the name.  You can joke that you're going to banish your female friends to the Red Shed for being 'unclean.'  That never gets old."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of the Shed.  I only go early evening or to watch a UW Hockey game.

Long Islands are the specialty and this rise to the occasion.

Bartenders are friendly and attentive.  Everything is fairly simple and open.  Jukebox works fine and I always get a few songs in during my time.

I just like the vibe of the place and would recommend it as a good dive bar for a good drink."}
{"text":"Two stars or two and a half stars? I cannot decide. Ultimately, Red Shed is as the Yelp label says, a dive bar. For a dive bar it sits somewhere between below average and average.

Everything in the bar is sticky and could easily be wiped down more often, considering it is not as crowded as many of the bars on State. The drinks are cheap and show it in the taste. Mostly everything is going to be made with rail liquor. You really are not given the option otherwise. Red Shed takes cash only and has a random ATM that is going to charge you a nominal fee for using it.

There are pool tables, dart boards, and a cash eating jukebox to occupy your time.

My experience was pretty meh overall. We visited because a coworker was celebrating a birthday and wanted a cheap long iced tea (good if that's your thing). I ended up getting a a New Castle on tap for $2. It definitely tasted like a $2 tap beer. For whatever reason the beer tasted sour and watered down. I know New Castle isn't the best, but it does not taste sour!

I also later had a white Russian while hanging out. It was $5.50, and the bartender didn't have any Kahlua (what?!) so he made it with rail coffee liquor. He made is strong as an apology but without asking. The drink was absolutely awful. I wouldn't have ordered it if I knew it was going to have half a cup of rail coffee liquor dumped in it.

I would not recommend Red Shed unless you don't have enough money to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple. This is an average bar. I'm not too big on the atmosphere and the single bathroom can make for a long line, but all you need to know is that their giant long island iced teas are to die for. They are by far the best I've ever had. I'll be sure to stop back in for one many times in the future."}
{"text":"I love the Red Shed. Went their a few times this weekend....Boy do they have great drink specials. Monday night we got $1.50 TOP SHELF mixers. What a bargain. We walked in and got seats right at the bar. The next night we stopped by for 1/2 price pints of beer. We had 2 pints of good beer for $3.75. So I was in town 2 nights & hit this place both nights.
I have to admit I'm bias since my Dad loved this place & use to take me there 30+ years ago when I was a kid. They use to have great food, but they don't serve food anymore.
I'd give it 5 Stars if the bathrooms were not so disgusting..."}
{"text":"The crowd is not my scene,  but they make a strong yet decent tasting long Island. the main draw for me was competitive foosball almost any night of the week. its been a few years though."}
{"text":"I have gone back a few times since my poor experience here and both times have been a blast. Good music, great location near restaurants and its one of the few bars near here that has a pool table."}
{"text":"Mason jars. Full of booze. Tiny, typically unclean bathroom. Friendly bartenders. This is the Red Shed. And it's equal parts fun and blackout horrifying. 

The drinks are super cheap, and while you're attempting to figure out what exactly is in your mason jar filled with booze, you can play foosball or grab a seat with some buds. 

Drink with caution, enjoy with gusto. Viva la Red Shed."}
{"text":"13.50 for a PITCHER OF COORS LIGHT!  Monday night in a college town dive bar.  Are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"Welcome to a dive bar that is a dive bar without irony.  Home of fantastic gigantic long islands sold in mason jars.  The Red Shed tends to attract college kids and dudes going to games. There's table soccer, darts, and pool.  I have good word this place hasn't changed since the 1970's."}
{"text":"Environment seems decent for a college bar but bartender was rude and pretentious. Directly insulted a friend, his wife, and their child.  Did not order, will not be back."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE..

Ok, I warned you.  Good thing you blacked out for the broken glass in the toilets, the sinks that turn into urinals, etc etc.

But wasn't the foosball game you played at 1 am a lot of fun?

And aren't you still trying to figure out what were in those mason jars?  No, they were definitely bigger than pints jars.  Those were quart jars....  And your hangover is bad enough that you may never go near those tomatoes you canned last summer.

There is a covered wagon, oregon-trail-style, over the door.  Real Western.  Ever seen hbo's deadwood?   You're lucky to leave deadwood's tavern alive.  Same goes for the red shed.

DO NOT GO HERE.

(I can't wait to go back)"}
{"text":"Oh the Red Shed. I first came here in my early twenties and now frequent this establishment for pre-game drinks before Badger Basketball Games. This is normally just a stop in, have a few drinks and then head out to a game.

Grab a Long Island while our there and don't forget your Cash. No plastic. 

Service has always been great here whether it's 11 a.m. on a Saturday morning or 7 p.m. on a Friday night. You can park right next door in the ramp."}
{"text":"Back in the day this was one of our hangouts so it is good to see it is still surviving after most other places from way back are now gone.  We had last visited five years ago on our last trip to Madison for a Badger football game.  

We popped in late morning for a pre-game drink and the place was pretty busy. We did not get our old standby - a tray of Shooters.  Instead I ordered an Old Fashion since I was in Wisconsin (I had been sampling them all weekend).  This particular one was not that great - either too much bitters or too much of their mix.  The others who had beer were satisfied.  

I did not order food but always loved the grill behind the bar - classic. 

I certainly hope this joint continues to exist given all of the gentrification and upscale building occurring in the downtown area..."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place even though every day after I go to this place is filled with a terrible hangover.  The Long Island iced teas are hands down the best in Madison.  They're 7 dollars and in a mason jar.  They are dangerous.  Don't come to this bar too hammered and order one and don't have more than one on any occasion.  As far as the dirty bathrooms go I haven't really noticed - always been too drunk at that point to care. The Red Shed is a must visit in  Madison."}
{"text":"Saturday night near campus post hockey game.  My first time here, so I'm not sure what the typical clientele is.  The drinks are expensive, as all are.  The music selection was entertaining, I haven't heard an entire bar sing Blink 182 since. Well, ever.  But it was packed, a neat rustic feeling like I was back up in the Northwoods complete with hunting photos with deer and Google eyes on it.  But, score, I was carded.  And I could actually hear my friends while we talked.  There's darts, foozeball tables, pool.  We did find a table, but our service was clearing the cups of ice off our table.  But, it's Saturday night and those servers are busy pouring."}
