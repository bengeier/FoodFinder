{"text":"Some of the best food and service around. Excellent place to go for a nice dinner. This time I went for the veal it was tender and tasty I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The services was great, no complaints there. My steak was cooked well but lacked flavor, which the sauce could not make up for. Crab Cake and Au Gratin Potatoes were delicious. I wouldn't seek this restaurant out on my own but if someone else wanted to go I wouldn't object."}
{"text":"i havve been a customer since the opening 14 years ago and a member of their 837 club. i made a res. a week in advance for a quiet table.  we were seated at the loudest table right by the door the waiters go in and out of the kitchen . i was told a booth was not avaliable , but 2 opened up within in 10 minutes but no offer to move us. i complained later to the asst. mgr . and was told we were seated their because we requested a particular waiter that was not so. customr service 101 would say something should be free on a bill over $450 but nothing was. that was our last trip to the charlotte palm."}
{"text":"Late afternoon dinner at the Palm... I wanted to leave when we were not received for about 10 minutes, but we gave them some time to realize there were customers up front. After someone in the kitchen finally noticed us, we were seated at a table, with no menus... Then, our waiter introduced himself, took away extra silverware, and gave us no menus. We asked... Should we get out own menus? He said he would get us some. He then proceeded to chat with some waiter buddies in plain view. Since the restaurant was almost completely empty, it looked like we were interrupting a break. After several minutes of chit-chat, the waiter finally delivered some menus (how hard is that?). Perusing the menu, it was clear the Palm doesn't believe in meals, which I guess is because meals are... gauche. You can order a steak for $45, but you won't get a salad or a side unless you buy a separate $8 plate of veggies or $8 salad. I just couldn't believe a 9 oz. piece of meat would be worth that much (plus, I'd rather a 6 oz. filet). So, we ordered the Veal and Chicken Parm. (~$35), which do not come with any noodles unless you pay $4 extra (thus bringing the Parms. up to ~$40). I also ordered a coffee, which was just OK, and asked for a bread basket, which was room temperature and less enjoyable than the Mimi's bread basket. On the plus side, the entrees were excellent, and had there been half as much Chicken Parm., a vegetable, and some well-prepared noodles or potatoes, I wouldn't have felt so ripped off. As is, two chicken breasts was way too much chicken and too little fine dining. In addition, the lighting in the restaurant was not very romantic/intimate, and there was a noticeable lack of ambiance. We managed to escape from the restaurant for $110 total (no salads, no desserts, no alcohol), for a meal that was less enjoyable than many $60 meals ($30 per person) we've enjoyed at other restaurants (with at least 1 salad, 1 dessert, and 1 glass of wine). If someone else had been paying the bill, I had ordered the lacking sides, and I had never seen the price, I may have had a better experience, but the service and ambiance still were nothing to write home about. (Hi, Mom!)"}
{"text":"Just can't see it for the money.  There are just too many other choices out there for this kind of money and even less.  Not quite sure what the target market is for this place.  Pricing, menu, and wait staff lean toward fine dining, but the place has the look and feel of theme joint.  We sat in a room with 6 tables, no less than 4 wait staff attending.  Five tables were dressed and well-mannered and one table, parents with what could have been twin girls late 20's early 30's, definitely sisters sitting with dad in a t-shirt, all loud, and I'm fairly certain, all drunk.  None of the staff said a word to these people even after the table behind us dropped a subtle hint to the waiter. 

Sure, the food is better than most restaurants per-se, but for that amount of dinner bill, comparatively it isn't good at all.  I can name five places off the top of my head that are 3 times the food and 10 times the dining experience for the same or less.  

I went specifically for the swordfish which l read on the trip advisor menu but wasn't on the actual menu.  No bother to update that menu to reflect current menu omissions.  I am however contributory to that since a little more research on my account would have turned up the online menu from their site which is up to date.  

I settled for the veal martini which was fairly flavorful but over kill on the basil.  The veal was tough also.  My daughter had the filet.  She was struggling cutting it in which our waiter literally came over and cut it for her and he struggled a bit himself.   It was daughter's night out so I just let it go with a soft smile.   I'm not a filet person, but it is the only cut my wife and younger son order.   We were at Sullivan's and she just about cut her filet with her fork.  Capital Grille two weeks ago, my son, same thing.  

I gave it a poor rating based on the demographics of the market.  For 58.00 my daughter has to get red faced because the waiter jumped in to help her cut her meat like a she's 6 years old. (She's 15; God forbid Dad help never mind the waiter) And for 42.00 my wife can cut hers with a fork and my son the same thing for 44.00 and neither place had loud rude people in t-shirts!  If a $48.00 probably choice cut filet, $9.50 quasi caesar salad, $13.00 asparagus, $36.00 tough veal dish, wasn't enough, I had two 8oz diet cokes at $4.25 each!  Hey guys, those other restaurants in your market; they refill your soft drink as a good will gesture because you chose to dine with them!"}
{"text":"I may have to call this place my favorite steak house in Charlotte.  A friend and I decided to give this place a try during the CIAA tournament, since it's away from uptown.

We arrived around 7:30 pm for our 8 pm reservations and we were seated just a little after 8.  Before being seated we had a few drinks at the bar and took in some of the decor.  The walls  were covered with various caricatures of celebrities, I thought that was a pretty cool thing to decorate the walls with.  The overall decor is very inviting, I think they may have outdone Morton's and Ruth Chris.

The food was excellent.  I ordered an 18 oz new york strip and I must say it's one of the best cooked steaks I've had in Charlotte.  The seasoning was perfect and they got the temperature perfect for a medium-rare steak. The potato and cream of spinach sides were really awesome and I just couldn't get enough of the flour-less chocolate cake.

Service was great.  Our waitress was very friendly, attentive and patient.  She had no problems with answering our questions about the various cuts of meat, the sauces or the lobster sizes.

I don't have any negatives to report for this establishment and I will be returning many times in the future.  Just out of curiosity, I would like to see one of the 6 pound lobsters that our waitress told us about :)"}
{"text":"Eh, went here on Christmas for dinner. Had to first seating at 5. Order the special the prime rib, 5 minutes later oh we just sold out of that! great ordered the filet and it was just ok. Wine was outrageously overpriced. Amazing this place gets such great reviews. Oh and im OG palm one goer. The lobbies would have been a better call."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque is absolutely to die for! The GM here is the best around not only because he plays such an active part in service but also because he always remembers us and we've only been a few times!!"}
{"text":"Just Ok for $$ but not for $$$$ !  Diffently not worth the money !"}
{"text":"A friend and I went there for her birthday. The 3 pound lobster was perfectly done and cracked open for us. The lobster bisque was very good and warm but not hot. The salad was crisp fresh and abundant. I loved the saut√©ed spinach even though it may have been a little heavy on the garlic. The wait staff was very attentive without being intrusive. We had a wonderful evening in a warm and inviting environment on a cold night."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of the palm the palm is the bomb.
The bar is small but still great service and they make an excellent goose and tonic
Just about everything you order there is fantastic I have never had to send anything back ever.
The parking there is sketchy at best it's improved a little bit since they built the parking deck in the back
And it's nice if you have a fantastic dinner and have a lot of drinks you can stay at the Hampton Inn which is right next door before I moved to Charlotte I used to stay there and it was fantastic all the time what a great place to stay and just to have the palm right outside your hotel was a great convenience always went to the palm when I was in town
Now that I live here I probably only go once every two years but I love it"}
{"text":"This has got to be the most overrated restaurant in Charlotte. Anyone that rates this restaurant 5 stars have no clue what good food is. My daughter's veal masala tasted delish but my atlantic salmon was tasted stale and smelled funny. I didn't complain. I just waited for my daughter to finish her food, paid and got out of there."}
{"text":"Always a lovely experience. We love to sit on the patio, the service is always so wonderful.  We always get the lobster salad! They don't skimp on lobster meat at all"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!!!  This is one of my fav Clt restaurants!!  The service is absolutely the best!!!!!!  Anything goes.  Whatever you ask for, they accommodate!!!  The food is delicious!!!  Everything is soooo good!!  I start with a tease like a tart martini...tastes like key lime!!  Sweet and delish!!  Then I almost always get the caesar salad and chicken parm.  Ahhh my mouth is watering as I type this!!!  For dessert the chocolate cake is a must!!  It is soooooo the best!!!  The food is pricey butttt the portions are HUGE!!!  You will definitely have some leftovers!!  Go for sure!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype for this place. Service was ok and my filet mignon was SO overcooked and lacked flavor. The only decent part about my meal was the molten chocolate cake. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Everyone is great, Matt is the server we generally use. Consistent food and great service. Try the Persian ginger!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and it did not disappoint. The food was excellent and so was the service. We enjoyed the Chilean Sea Bass and the Veal Parm and wow these dishes are spot on. The atmosphere was amazing and fairly quiet. I would go back again whether it was with friends or for a special occasion again."}
{"text":"Overall an excellent experience. Service is excellent Evan though she never brought me my lemon for my water. When paying over 200 for dinner for 2 I would like my lemon please. Guess I am picky. The steaks were phenomenal but again she reversed our temperature of cooking mine was the way my guest wanted his and his was the way I wanted mine. But still quality meat so no complaints. They do push to pad the bill but I knew it and accepted so shame on me. Will definitely return soon and maybe be a little more assertive. Also did not have my regular waiter so hopefully will get him back. It is a keeper!"}
{"text":"Delicious meal! High end restaurant in South Park 
Valet service was an added bonus 
Chose the special- 4 lb lobster! Only $99 - shared with my husband 
Had tomato bisque soup, house salad, potatoes and wonderful wine"}
{"text":"Okay so everyone knows what the Palm is.  The steaks are generally really good, the service is usually good, and the prices are stupid high.  That's the deal - good food, okay environment with fair sketches of middling local celebrities, stupid high prices.  But the point is that the food has to be PERFECT.  If I am going to pay $50 for a NY Strip, it needs to be cooked to order and done exactly correctly.  The problem with the meal we had last night is that it was just okay.  I had the caprese salad to start - it was $15 and consisted of two tomato slices (big, but flavorless) and buffala mozzarella (good not great).  My daughter had the bisque - flour-y and flavorless.  we had two NY strips and the prime rib.  The prime rib was HUGE and good.  The strips were okay - one was cooked medium well when ordered medium rare and one cooked correctly, but nothing much to it.  All in all, it was fine, the service was good, but without alcohol, the ticket was $200+ and for that money, it was not nearly good enough.

Gotta do better."}
{"text":"So good been there 25 times this year and the food is amazing and I had it with my wife and tasted exciting so I would recommend it anyway"}
{"text":"Very nice ambience. Exotic food. But very slow service. Even after making a reservation in advace had to wait for 20 minites to be seated."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant multiple times.  We use Open Table to book reservation on-line, so this restaurant has our history of what what type of table preference we like, our waiter/waitress request, and previous order history (...if there's a special drink we like a certain way).  Knowing that, this restaurant is consistent and rarely misses a beat.  My last visit was their King Crag legs and  were a generous portion, sweet and flavorful....My new favorite, since I'm not always a red meat fan.  Their Monday night salad is excellent, and should be tried...Its a chopped salad that is very tasty and different from the typical leafy type salad or wedge salad. 
I took off 1 star, and because we have a history of going there, for some reason the familiar staff needs to feel like they have to entertain or visit us.  Because this is a special occasion restaurant, we like to go and enjoy each others company, without the intrusion of the staff visiting or socializing with us.  We go for a nice dinner with good service and would prefer just that.  

Oh...If your not a member of the 937 Club, it is well worth the investment.  we have acquired many points and The Palm is always stirring up some yummy creative specials.  

Overall, this is one of our favorite places to dine."}
{"text":"been there 2 times.  it is way overpriced and the service is average.  capital grille is much better.  mortons is better. not a big fan."}
{"text":"Exemplary. From start to finish. Top notch food and service, as expected. Can't wait to come back. Although, can be pricy- bill was $485, plus $100 tip. The guys are big eaters, lol."}
{"text":"This place feels like home. Everyone welcomes you like they know you, and if you're from around here, they probably do. I've been coming to The Palm since I was a child. Came back for the first time in year with my mom to celebrate my birthday. The bread that comes in the basket is from Great Harvest and is a very high quality bread. My favorite is the little one with the raisons (don't be afraid of it, it's amazing!). I had the shrimp cocktail and nearly killed myself with the horseradish because I wasn't sure how hot it was! That was fun. The salads are also fantastic. I was given a happy birthday card which all of the staff signed. How sweet! Oh, it was also nice having dinner across from the Joker."}
{"text":"A safe and solid choice, power lunches are good here and decent happy hour specials as well.  Can't think of a time where I'd pick it over Del Frisco's, but you can never go wrong.  Nice area to walk around, with a movie theater and Dean & Deluca down the way."}
{"text":"After 5-6 dinners and the same number of lunches here..the level of service and food is always high.  Once you get to this level (del friscos, joe's, etc.) of steak it really comes down to the service and so far I've been treated extremely well every time I've been here."}
{"text":"Classic steakhouse. Very much old school in the vein of Mortons or Capital Grille. Picture cartoon charicatures on the wall of patrons and famous folks who have eaten there.

Definitely a solid steak dinner. Wait staff is attentive. Good wine selection and the food is always good. It doesn't really do a lot to separate itself from the other higher end steak places but it certainly isn't disappointing either."}
{"text":"Simply put the service is great, the atmosphere is very classic which I like, but the food is just meh and terribly overpriced. My wife and I were on a weekend vacation and both had the filet and I had some lobster as well. It was just ok. Started with the Caesar salad which was not very flavor full. My steak came out over cooked, sent it back and they brought me a whole new dish cooked like I had ordered. It was just ok, for the same price we can get much better wet aged steaks that are much more full flavor at home. If you have $60 per person to drop plus tip go ahead and go but you probably won't be too impressed."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Nice bar to wait in.  Menu adequate with a number of pricey upscale option for beef and/or surf and turf.  
Nice wine selection.  A bit pricey but the food was very good good.  We joined friends for the evening upon their recommendation and we were very pleased. 
Recommended for sure"}
{"text":"My first time at the Palm and was hugely disappointed. The special was Lobster but I am not a fan of seafood and ordered the 9 oz filet. I like mine pale pink or med well to well. The waiter asked if pink was ok and I could always send it back. So I had to, twice and then it was basically ruined. My med well to well was more medium to med rare. It was red, not pink. My husband ordered the linguini with clams and for $26 had very few clams and had to ask for more. We head been to Miro the previous night and I had twice the amount of pasta for less than he received. 

We found the restaurant over priced and average for food. Have zero interest in ever returning."}
{"text":"Mr. Rogers asks, \"Can you spell over-rated?  Sure...I knew you could.\"  I can't say a single bad thing about this place.  I just can't say a single good thing.  OK!  The creamed spinach is good."}
{"text":"So I figured I needed one more 5-star steakhouse review, so here it is. Yes, I'm a fan of steakhouses, as much for the ambiance and service as I am the food. I like to call my visits to steakhouses, \"scotch & steak\" as that is how I roll at these places. Not the cheapest way to go, but the style that I choose. What sets The Palm at the top is its attention to service, not only to me, but everyone around me as I listened in to their conversations with other servers. Definitely a spot for loyal regulars of which I will now become one of. 

Got there last night around 6:30pm and sat down at the bar and ordered my scotch from Michele, who was a great bartender offering up just the right amount of conversation. The bar area is long and has plenty of seats as well as small 2-top tables behind it. When my colleague arrived we decided to grab a booth next to the bar area...this is the way to go for me as you get the bar/lounge steakhouse feel. Now for the steaks...probably the highest price in Charlotte, even a tad higher than Morton's. All steak started in the $40's and went up to the $60's. My colleague, who is a regular, went with the \"off-the-menu\" porterhouse, while I went with the new your strip. Had my standard side of mushrooms and a wedge salad to start. 

The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, with a \"Pittsburgh crust\", which adds the char to the steak. This is slightly different than a true Pittsburgh style steak, which had the char, but it cool/rare in the center. It was recommended my the waiter (thanks Tony!), and it was delicious! If you're around Southpark I would choose The Palm over Del Frisco's all day long."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for sometime and Restaurant Week was a perfect time to do it!

My friends and I made reservations for 7:30, when we arrived they greeted us and said they were just waiting for our table to be cleared and to hang out at the bar until it was ready. So we headed to the bar and were seated about 10 minutes later. 

The first cool thing about this place is the caricatures on the wall, there  famous and some local faces with their names and even some signature everywhere you looked! I thought this was a very cool touch!

Once seated we were presented with one of the most amazing bread baskets I've seen. But keep in mind, I'm totally a bread lover! There was a white, wheat and whole grain, sweet cinnamon and even breadsticks! It's a bread lovers dream. 

The menu looked absolutely delicious, I ordered the lobster bisque, jumbo lump crab cakes and mango salsa and key lime pie for dessert.

The lobster bisque was divine! It was creamy and rich. The only thing I wanted was more lobster! Other than that it was one of the best I've tasted! But make sure they add some cracked pepper for more flavor! 

The jumbo lump crab cakes were absolutely amazing.  Literally overwhelmed with crab meat...OH MY GOODNESS. I really don't have another way to describe it, they were outstanding! The mango salsa was really fresh and worked as a great compliment with the meal.

They key lime pie was great too! A great and refreshing way to end the meal. 

This place was really great! Our server was wonderful and we had a lovely time. Look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time and always have a great experience. My hands down favorite (served as a special for lunch) is the Burger with bacon and provolone, tomatoes and lettuce with the delicious pickle and spectacular Parmesan fries... Accompanied by a coke out of a glass bottle poured over ice. Yummm. The wife had surf & turf, her exact words \"Best Lobster tail I ever had\". And we also love the scallops wrapped in bacon, always perfectly prepared. Top notch service and a delicious cappuccino to finish it all off, even if you have no room for dessert. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's hard to believe after all these years the Palm can charge you $60+ bucks for a steak without a sauce ($3) or side ($11), and still offer perhaps the worst service in SouthPark. The hostess who thinks she's guarding Queen Elizabeth and must condescend every guest, to the server who pops up every half hour or so but still feels entitled to a 25% tip... you'll find them both here, next to some of the best steaks in the Queen City. If you can get past the tired, dated ambiance which is badly in need for a makeover, you will still get a great meal provided you aren't expecting the service that accompanies visits at the city's other premier steakhouses."}
{"text":"We had a decent meal here. Unfortunately the service was really, really slow today at lunch. And we ordered a chicken parmesan-- which came with literally nothing on the side, not even pasta or a veggie. Just chicken, cheese and marinara. However the prime steak salad's steak was done very well."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Had salad and glass of wine for $38.  Salad contained a lot of lettuce and chicken which looked like lunch meat and did not taste good."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars for the service but Iam sad to say the food is just 2 stars if that. I got the lobster and filet otherwise known as the surf and turf and the lobster was just terrible! The filet was also not very flavorful but better than the lobster. The appetizers were so so. I honestly had the best meal of my stay in Charlotte which was a 10$ burger down the street. I'm very disappointed with this place and for 100$ meal for just myself it should have been mind blowing but it just left a less than good impression. Their desserts were the only good part of the meal! I will not be back!"}
{"text":"LOVED it!  Ate there for Thanksgiving dinner. Perfect choice.  Food, service and atmosphere was exceptional."}
{"text":"We went for a friend's birthday and this was great food. Sometimes you find that a high end restaurant have slow service and weak drinks. Not here! The service was #1 and the drinks and food were the best. I was very impressed with the management too. They checked on us a number of times to make sure we were taken care of. Thanks Joey, you did great!"}
{"text":"Excellent service with experienced management and waiters.
Food including: lobster, steak, shrimp, sides, and desserts are excellent.
Caesar salad a little bland.
Pricey for Charlotte - this is no Mastro's."}
{"text":"Great service, comfortable atmosphere and food grossly overpriced! Would expect a steak of this value to be perfectly cooked. They got it right the second time. Will wait for a very SPECIAL occasion to retun."}
{"text":"Over rated would be my first thought on this, though the lobster is superb! If you want to drop a lot of money and maybe see a couple of TV actors and a few nice cars, this is a good place to go. There is always a Maserati parked outside sometimes a Ferrari and once a Lambo... inside, the decor is nothing to shout about, very sports barish with lots of drawings of people who i suppose have stopped there...  there is a Palm in the Ceasars in Vegas and that experience was way better that this one, decor and service wise. 

I did hang out with some co-workers there a few times for drinks and it was pleasant enough..."}
{"text":"Terrific meal guaranteed. Great wine list. Service is always great (Steve). Festive atmosphere. @palmrestaurant #quality"}
{"text":"I've tried it twice and won't be going back.The first was a romantic meal with the wife; decor is an interesting talking point but creates more of a roadside dinner feel rather than the white table cloth experience. Bread was good and service good, I had fish which was OK and the wife had steak which was good but the a filet had too much grizzle for her. The second visit was a works lunch, I had planned Del Frisco's for an American steak house experience for overseas guests but it was closed so decided to try the Palm. Big mistake, lunch menu was poor and the dinner menu is very over priced, the place was empty (not suprised) and my NY strip and fries was the worst steak I've ever paid for. Overcooked, tough and tasted like it had gone bad. I won't return to places that serve bad food knowingly.

The works lunch for three with soft drinks came to over $200 with tip, I don't mind paying for good food but thats a rip off for what we were served.

Pro's; The place has a traditional steakhouse feel and good waiters, the bread is excellent and location nice, not to busy, easy to park and nice for a stroll after diner.

Con's; The food is so over priced, the quality wasn't good and the whole experience very poor."}
{"text":"4 different family events and all 4 were screwed up. This time I ordered the largest steak they offer. It was so burnt as to be charred. It was turned into gray meat and cost almost 100 dollars. I done going here. Now I need to convince my elderly parents not to have family get together at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was very, very disappointed in this place. The food is way overpriced for the quality. We ordered the burgers and they were dry & barely edible. Our waitress was also terrible. Slow and inattentive. If I go to a fine dining restaurant, I want/expect great, great food and attentive service. I absolutely did NOT get that here. Don't waste your money. Go to the Melting Pot instead. Awful."}
{"text":"I would love to give them a better review, but they just didn't earn it.  We ordered the humongous $99 lobster and we should have known better.  Those big-boys just don't taste all that well to start with, and it was not expertly cooked, either.  The side of Brussels' sprouts were touted as al dente; however, it was tough to fork them off the plate.  My wife's lobster bisque was the highlight and my Caesar salad was bland and lifeless (although they did give ample portions of anchovies).

Beyond the heavy decor and the shtick of getting your caricature painted on the wall if you spend a lot, the most disappointing part of the evening was the table side \"pitch\" to join the 837 Club.  Really?!?  I just laid out $200 and your idea of a wonderful close to the meal before dessert is to present me a brochure and encourage me to join a dinner club?  I could not have been more surprised and for a moment thought I was flying coach on US Airways on my way back from Cancun.  Imagine my greater surprise that I was pitched again AFTER dessert, too.  Yes, they did (and no, I'm not joining)!

Lastly, we made our reservations through Open Table, which was honored.  I made comments on their site that this was our 37th anniversary.  I was not looking for a freebie or clapping or a cupcake, but it would have been nice if they acknowledged it to my wife.  For all the hype and price, Palm Restaurant needs to rattle a few coconuts at this location."}
{"text":"Had a small luncheon with friends.  Enjoyed their creamed spinach and Brussels sprouts.  Service was great and would recommend to others.  Looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Great dinner! I had the Veal Martini entree. The table shared side items which included brussel sprouts, mushrooms, and three cheese potatoes au gratin. For dessert I had the vanilla bean Creme br√ªl√©e which was phenomenal. My wine selection for the night was the Meiomi Pinot Noir."}
{"text":"Honestly I'm not sure what the big rave is about this place. My company celebrates International Women's Day and part of it was lunch and the people planning it chose The Palm. They both raved about it etc. So they have this pre-fixed 3 course power lunch menu going on. So most of us chose to do that. Nothing stood out to me... The ceasar salad ehhh I've had WAY better. For the entree had the steak medallions with the fries/onion strings (the side choices are awful!!) and for a steakhouse that was some lame steak.  Desert choices were flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake. I got the chocolate because I love it and even that was rather disappointing but it was the best thing I ate. Truly I felt like I was eating somewhere like Applebee's and their prices do not reflect that. Thankfully it wasn't my tab and I'd never go back. The service was really good for our large group but the restaurant was empty so they didn't have anything else to do."}
{"text":"The Palm never disappoints, as long as you know what you're going for:  impeccable service, classy yet unstuffy atmosphere, fabulous food and a price tag to match.  We usually go just for special occasions.  Like once a year anniversary.

Our wait staff was excellent as always - all 3 of them (plus the GM, who has been there forever and welcoming as ever).  Never got below a half glass of tea or water, never a finished/dirty dish on the table for more than a minute, and the only times they were noticed was when they were bringing casual, relevant and delightful conversation.  

The Monday Night Chop-Chop Salad is my favorite dish here for many years, along with the crab cake.  Never had another chopped salad or crab cake to match.   I request the salad with no dressing but balsamic on the side - and it wins every time.   The crab cake I've tried to duplicate at home, but lose every time.  It's 91% lump crab meat and 9% diced mango -  magically held together with NOT BREAD but love and tenderness and unparalleled cuisine perfection.  

My sweet hubby ordered filet, unfortunately a bit underdone for his taste.  Surprising, since he's had this cut /  heat at the Palm almost every time we go and it's typically cooked spot on, but this time, just a tad too pink.  

The only disappointment came with the lobster mac and cheese.  It was a ginormous serving of mac and cheese, but unfortunately he said nothing special.  He ate several bites and never encountered even a hint of lobster.  And this boy knows his lobster (his 2nd favorite dish at the Palm).   He returned it and was given his choice of sides, so stuck with the safe cottage fries, which were ok.   I mean, how wonderful can fried potatoes be... when you're paying $15 for half a potato.    Even after having to send a dish back.

Oh, they have sweet tea now.  Which hubby appreciated.

If you are a regular at the Palm, I know you love it.  If you've never been, please try it.  Just be fully aware of the price tag before you go.  

Thank you to our wait staff last night - you were beyond measure.  We'll be back.  Next year. xo"}
{"text":"What an amazing place.  Best steaks and seafood I have ever had!  The service is impeccable.  Each time we go, they remember us by name and always ask details about our kids, business, etc.  Very personable and laid back."}
{"text":"The service wasn't that great neither was the valet service. The steak was sub par, it was in line with like an outback not a great steakhouse. The decor was nice, the restaurant seemed clean enough. Over all I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great dinner tonight but was extremely disappointed to see they did not have the New Year's Eve special advertised on the website.   

When we inquired with the higher ups after being told by our waiter, Management alleged it was advertised as NOT at the Charlotte location, so I went home and checked my still open web browser.   While they were accurate it had been changed to fix the error sometime during dec 31 that is hardly helpful...   I found this out by refreshing the browser - it was updated sometime between this morning and tonight - during same day, and was disappointing to those who had made dinner reservations any time prior to the 31st, and were shocked to be told there is no ny Eve special here at this location (as if we were in error!!!) and they would not honor the special...

{"text":"This past Saturday, my family went to The Palm for my dad's birthday. Is it worth the price? For me, no. Two steaks, two prime ribs, two sides, a dozen oysters, three cocktails, and one bottle of wine equal a $454 check (not including tip). But the food was excellent. My mom's prime rib was about as big as her face, and the best she's ever had. The wait staff were all friendly and professional. 

This was actually my second trip to The Palm. The first was two years ago (also for my dad's birthday; my dad really loves The Palm). On that occasion, the food was excellent, but the waiter was not very good. We actually had to ask for steak knives. When a neighbor later asked my mom how dinner went, my mom explained about the poor service. The neighbor told her daughter (who at the time was a server at the restaurant), who told her manager. A couple days later my mom received a phone call from the manager apologizing for the service, and was sent a $150 gift certificate. That kind of consideration for the customer (as well as the food) is what keeps my parents coming back the The Palm and me as well, as long as I'm not picking up the check. ;)"}
{"text":"The people were nice the food...was ok I expected more way more. This place is small.  I came and was over dressed. I the sides were very ordinary. But the service was impeccable. I just wasn't impressed with the place. My waitress was so kind and attentive Thanks Amber! You made the experience worth it you were the kindest and went beyond my family appreciated you"}
{"text":"WAYYYYYYYYYYYYY OVERPRICED, HIGHLY OVERRATED!!! This is clearly a case of people wanting to say they dined at the Palm or someone in sales/marketing trying to impress a client. Food is way over buttered, greasy. Management a total crock. Servers are well trained and try to make up for all the B.S. Don't waste your money or gain 10 lbs. by visiting this over hyped \"joint\". I lived in Manhattan during the original Palm Restaurant days. Sawdust on the floor, no pretension. Just good food at affordable pricing. So much so that they opened Palm II to handle the spillover of customers. So they got bought out by a restaurant group who spent a lot on hype. We don't intend to set foot in a Palm again. Nor do family and friends who have had similar experiences at Palm CHAINS throughout the country."}
{"text":"Came here for Charlotte's Restaurant Week this week, where the price fixe everywhere is 30 bucks! Palm is the kind of place where that deal is worth it. The service was fine, although our server was a bit of the anxious type. I started with the mixed green salad, which was completely unmemorable. I say this because I literally had to go to the restaurant's website to figure out what the heck I ate for the first course. Apparently the mixed green salad. I vaguely remember the baby tomatoes.

However, we also had some sides as appetizers, which were truly phenomenal. The green beens were all oiled up with chunks of bacon in them. Wow. And the mashed potatoes were garlicky and very delicious.

For my second course, I had filet mignon medallions, which were also very good. I ordered them medium rare, and although the meat didn't quite \"melt\" with my knife like I wanted it to (perhaps due to the smaller size of the medallions), they were still quite tasty.

Apparently the Palm is known for its cheesecake, and I ordered that for dessert. Quite frankly, I'm used to every steak house having some sort of cheesecake, and they are all more or less good. But no. The Palm's cheesecake truly takes the cheesecake. It's HUGE and LOADED with sugar and a bunch of sweet fruit sauces are DUMPED ALL OVER IT. It was the best cheesecake I've eaten in years, possibly ever. I can't say for sure it was the best every, since clearly my memory is suspect, due to the fact that my memory of that mixed greens salad remains a little hazy...

Everything was washed down with two \"Strawberry Fields\" a sweet rum drink. It was fine. The beer list wasn't handy, and I didn't want to fill up on that."}
{"text":"We had a perfect meal last nite here. Lobster with stuffed crab in it yummy. Shrimp cocktail was great with fresh horseradish to mix in  our server Mathew was funny and went out of his way to make everything perfect for us  the manager checked on us frequently and I was so impressed with the excellent service and food I could go on and on  well done Palm"}
{"text":"The food was EXCELLENT!!!  The salmon was cooked perfect, awesome salad and the cheesecake was awesome!  The waiter and waitress were excellent with a great eye for detail!   yummy!"}
{"text":"Great spot! We really enjoyed the lobster event. We shared a 6lb, bigger than our heads! So much lobster! It was great. $200 lobster dinner well served. The best service. Great night out."}
{"text":"So good!!  I am happy I stopped in here on my night next door at the Hampton.  This is not a place to miss.  The drinks are perfection!  I loved the lobster bisque, so creamy and delicious.  The king crab legs...yum!  Sweet and tender.  And the cr√®me br√ªl√©e, creamy with a wonderful sugar crunch, not too sweet.  

Sitting on the patio was heavenly, next to the beautiful fountain.  The perfect weather with a delightful breeze.  What a great trip to Charlotte.  Love. 

The service is top notch, I was well taken care of."}
{"text":"Excellent as usual. Service is the best in charlotte. Crab cake sandwich, Reuben & Philly steak. Excellent carrot cake. I'll go back just for dessert. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The week my fourth baby was due I was really craving a big steak so, for what was possibly my last meal, my husband and I headed to The Palm. The service was incredibly attentive - from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. Everyone was nice but no cloyingly so or with any sort of uppity attitude that often accompanies a restaurant with prices this high. 

I have to admit that I have a problem making decisions and when I ask my server for a suggestion I really am interested in their opinion. Our server was fantastic and did not hesitate to be the \"decider\" when I was torn between 2 choices. I ordered a wedge salad with bleu cheese and Bacon (delish) after toying with the idea of lobster bisque. Although I intended to eat steak, the seafood options on the menu looked amazing. I convinced my husband to order blackened mahi mahi and I ordered a petit filet with the intent of creating our own surf and turf plate. We also ordered mushrooms as a side. Wow. Highly recommend. I must say that the only part of the meal that was less than spectacular was the steak! It was not seasoned at all. Nothing special. Next time I am craving a steak I will certainly head to Del Friscos.  Overall a nice experience but I'm not sure I'll be heading back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Yes it is a chain but some chains are good!  The only reason I didn't give the Palm five stars is because YOU NEED A 6 OZ STEAK.  Us chicks can't handle 9 ounces!!!  

I love the fillet - I get it with the Oscar option and I can't talk or think about anything else while I am eating it.  Perfectly cooked (I like medium-rare), perfectly seasoned (slightly salty!!), perfectly served in a little bit of au jus.  I had happy dreams for days....sigh....  

The app we got was the bacon-wrapped scallops - perfectly cooked and served on a bed of spinach.  Just fantastic.  I love the old school bread sticks in the wrapper.  Such a perfect way to shovel the Palm butter into my pie-hole.  

Service is excellent - fast and knowledgeable about every dish and historic artifact about the Palm.  Love it!

This location valet's which I recommend because you will need someone to roll you out after you have eaten every last drop!  Can't wait for the next special occasion!!!!
  :-D"}
{"text":"My wife wanted to try this restaurant. I've been before however and felt it was ok.  The service was fantastic and the food amazing.   The bread service is very good as they give you a basket that includes raisin bread which i love and a sunflower seed bread that was very dense but delicious.   We ordered the 9oz filet and chicken parmesean.   Every one liked there meal.  I liked it but im a fan of ruths chris so this just didn't quite do it for me."}
{"text":"As the other reviews stated, the bread basket was amazing. Out on a date, we ordered an appetizer, calamari, two entrees and two individual sized sides. We were stuffed!! The crab cakes were AMAZING. There was no filler, as many crab cakes have, and the salsa and chipotle sauce really complimented the dish. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium - as asked for). We had the cheesy potatoes, very rich, and the fried asparagus, really good. 

The reason why this restaurant did not get five stars is because the service was often overbearing and I felt the sales pitch for their exclusive club was a little too forward. Also, their complementary valet service was staffed only by one guy and after waiting for about five minutes, we parked the car ourselves despite the rain. Their pricing was average for a steakhouse but a little bit high for the environment and service. 

Tip: the last reservation/seating they take is 8 pm. A couple arrived just after us, like five minutes, and were not seated for dinner. I'm not sure this is a Sunday thing or what, but we were some of the only diners in the restaurant."}
{"text":"First/last time dining at The Palm in South Park. I have lived in Charlotte since 92' and dined at many of the reputable establishments in the area, except here. Even with my considerable amount of patience for bad servers (from my time serving throughout college) I was appalled by the service provided. Such a distasteful and negligent person to work in a place that charges a moderately high price for decently seasoned/prepared food. The reputation of this restaurant was certainly not accurate. No manager did table checks (or this wouldn't be in a review), our server blatantly told us she forgot to ring in our salad, felt my dress without asking awkwardly, laid silver down and explained it would \"be a long while before food would be available\", never was told the specials, had to tell her the ingredients in a French Martini 3 times. The worst part? I feel as if I was over 35 someone possibly would have asked how our experience had been and found this all out themselves, possibly tried to rectify the situation. When restaurants allow small children to run their business these things slip between the cracks. Filet bland, NY strip bland, server horrid (Hazize), ambiance questionable, $200 later a wasted date night. At one point we tried to ignore the service & food to enjoy each others company when a food runner dropped an entire entree on a nearby booth. With no shortage of amazing places around the SP area, no doubt our family will never relive the joke called \"The Palm\""}
{"text":"Five star and all star! Ok, so if you're looking for a great steakhouse without the prententious atmosphere I think you'll find it here.  It's my favorite premium steakhouse based on the fact they treat you like family every single time.

The wine selections are great and plenty.  I normally stick with the house Merlot or Pinot Noir.  Of course I normally always get a steak so always reds for me ;)

As you might know everything is a'la carte and served family style.  They have a great selection of salads and the blue cheese wedge is an all time classic there.  The sides for the entrees are also fantastic.  I normally stick with the asparagus friti or the three cheese mashed potatoes.

I've had both the lobster and a few of the steak selections when visiting.  My favorite steak there is the filet mignon oscar, medium, slightly pink in the center.  Always served to protection and a perfect temp.  

Deserts are no slouch either here.  Most are pretty large and of course one of my favorites is probably one of the largest they have.  The 7-layer chocolate cake....chocolate overload!

No doubt, this is a fantastic place for a quick bar bite after work all the way to special dinners for anniversaries or just because type dinners.

NOTE:  The Palm also has a 'rewards program' of sorts.  You join for I think $50 for the years and you get a point for every dollar spent.  Once you reach 500 points you automatically get a free 3lb lobster for your birthday....ummm.....yes!"}
{"text":"Very good, not great, food. It seems to me the emphasis here is about \"being seen\" rather than the culinary experience."}
{"text":"How have I been deprived for so long? I have frequented a lot of steak houses in my time and how hubby managed to keep me out of this place for so many years I will never know. I am so over Filets so I ordered the NY steak with Chimchurri on the side and it was A.Mazing! I have already decided this is where I want to go for my birthday this year. Service-perfect, food-perfect, martini-perfect. What more could one ask for? Just remember, you get what you pay for and pricey is to be expected here."}
{"text":"Seriously my Favorite Restaurant...Excellent for STEAKS, excellent for power lunches...we are 837 members...and boy we impressed the parents...we went to the original location in NYC couple years ago after a Yankees game and we were treated like family...HELLO 837 club is awesome...never feels like a chain, although they have maybe 25 locations...so you know you are getting a good meal anywhere you go, from Los Angeles to Vegas to D.C....we have tried them ...but Charlotte is our hometown, and our favorite.. Hands Down...OH...And my last meal on earth will include a PLATE OF LOBSTER SLIDERS...Joey is front of House and love seeing him when we go, Kristine is excellent at the bar-and really knows how to make a GREAT DRINK...the staff has all been there for years...so you know the restaurant & owner treats them well...that alone should make you want to try it...it is not cheap-But Well Worth It!"}
{"text":"Ok, so my review of the Palm in South Park is LONG overdue, I mean three girlfriend's in the past overdue. I visited in the spring of 2012. The day started with a Bark for Life walk off of Morrison in lovely South Park on a picturesque day with one beautiful blonde date, and culminated with another first date a petite, cute redhead at this location. To get right into it, I have to say, they gave us great service at the Palm. That's something you can't put a price on. I mean really good service. Imagine having butler service for three hours, and the butler is driving a Mercedes, so you know he takes his job seriously.

I met my date among a bustling crowd on a beautiful Saturday night.The waiter went out of his way to make us feel comfortable, and he was very attentive to our needs. I ordered the steak burger, it was very juicy, delicious, and bursting with flavor. It was an excellent portion size. The type of meat, we'll lets just say it was the expensive part of the cow, not rump roast. Unfortunately, I had only six bites of it because I had already eaten a sashimi appetizer at the Village Tavern in the Rotunda building in between dates. My date ordered the filet mignon, and it was delicious, cooked to perfection.

One goes to a place like the Palm for a special occasion, or like me for a blind first date on rare occurrences, but either way, you go for the service and the great food. They treated me like a king, and I will be back for sure. Come see how the other half lives at the Palm. It is sure to be a delight for you and your significant other. I wouldn't recommend the Palm for kids, unless they are very well behaved."}
{"text":"When I think of The Palm, I envision a fancy New Yorker carrying shopping bags in one hand as she hails a cab with the other on her way to (insert pretentious voice here) \"lunch at the Palm.\"  Not the case AT ALL.  The place is warm and welcoming, not hoity toity.

One of the best bread baskets I've ever laid my paws on:  a trio of breads locally sourced from Great Harvest Bread Company.

My recommendations:  CHILEAN SEA BASS, filet mignon, warm made-to-order cinnamon sugar doughnuts.

I posted a full review on the blog, but these are the highlights."}
{"text":"wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy overpriced for what you get!!!  well trained servers, but you're much better off going to ruth's chris."}
{"text":"Wish It Could be higher.The food was extremely decent for a lot of money, the stake was good but not great when I was about to leave some one sent me over some free dessert which tasted like shit! I appreciated the nice gesture but my god was it not good, if your looking for a friendly environment and a good overpriced stake go to the palm."}
{"text":"Lived in Charlotte for 25 years, now residing in Charleston. The Palm by far is the best steakhouse in the Carolinas. Great food, friendly accommodating staff (from Joey right down to the greeter), and wonderful food and drinks. Unlike some steakhouses, The Palm also offers a wide selection of seafood and pasta dishes. Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Not enough words to write a review for The Palm. Just one of the best steak houses in North America. Sign up for the 837 Club.  Accumulate enough points to get your portrait painted on the wall."}
{"text":"Sea Bass was to die for. If you go you have to try the flourless chocolate cake.  Service is top notch. Well worth the trip! You will leave stuffed for sure."}
{"text":"The Charlotte Palm is typical of other Palm locations - local patron and celebrity line drawings line the walls and the menu offers the same steak options as other locales. 

Valet parking is available, although this is a large free lot behind and to the side of the restaurant."}
{"text":"While I'm \"Original Gangsta\" and call Palm One my locale, I went to this one in Charlotte this past weekend while visiting friends down there. 

This was probably one of the best Palm bar areas I have been to, with its vaulted wooden ceilings and extra-long mahogany bar. The two story high ceilings made the space soar, but the cozy dark booths lined up one after the other made it intimate too. And honestly, when do you go to a Palm and not feel like family? 

The food was the same as in all over locations, delish. I'm always a bit surprised that I like it so much, and I shy away from chain restaurants, their food is always so sub-par, but the Palm constantly delivers a meal that makes my heart all aflutter. 

I had a chicken Cesar salad, the lamb chops and we all split sides. I do have to give this location a shout out because their mashed potatoes were SO GOOD. I mean perfectly prepared. I was excited about this because it's the only complaint that I have with Palm One in NYC - terrible mashed. Ah well, it's a small price to pay for a meal to remember. 

If you live in Charlotte, this may be one of your only options for decent food. This or Mac's Speed Shop...which isn't saying much."}
{"text":"I went again this last week, and it stepped way up two levels since last time, so I am upgrading my last review from 3 to 5 stars :-) Keep up the great work!  I will try to come back again soon.

Previous review:

I mostly enjoyed my initial visits at this branch of the Palm, and especially the concept of the 3 course lunch meals.  Some of the food was awesome, but there is room for improvement in the kitchen, as not everything coming out of the kitchen is consistent and right.  The chicken parmesan should be further tenderized, served flatter, and not served as bigger chunks of chicken.  Also, the breading did not stick very well to the chicken, was kind of mushy, and really fell apart when trying to eat it.   Something was just not right or careful in traditional Palm spirit in the prep.  Also, the baked clams were a bit over cooked on one visit and dried out and darkened/blackened too much from the broiler.  However, they were very tasty and perfectly prepared on another visit.  They also forget to serve the clam forks on one visit, which was a surprising miss.   A final opportunity is the iced tea.  It was absolutely fresh and excellent one time around the holidays and on the next visit when we came in for an early lunch seating on a slower day, it was cloudy, bitter, strong, and stale tasting. Maybe not changed from a previous day or days, or possibly just made poorly?   On the other hand, pickles, bread, and especially the salad with Russian dressing all tasted great across our visits.  The steaks were done nicely too...  Desserts also pleased.  However, I do expect the fine traditional Italian offerings and things like the iced tea to be better and more consistent each time.  The great Russian salad and the Italian food are the biggest drivers of why I visit the chain, so they need to be great to keep me coming and sometimes travelling very long distances to dine here.  I would hope to see my feedback used for significant execution improvement from the kitchen paying attention to the details, so it is a lot better next time. The service varied a little from great to good in terms of attentiveness, but great and attentive every time would be much better.  I really want them to succeed and be awesome in the Palm tradition.  I will come as much as I can, if they do keep stepping up.  They just need to work a little more to not slip or drop the ball some days, especially when the pace is slower...   When visiting different Palm branches recently, I give the Los Angeles and Beverly Hills Palm restaurants an A and A+ respectively.  I went to the Beverly Hills branch 3 times on one long weekend visit because it was so great.   Boston gets an A to A-.  Washington D.C. unfortunately did not even pass for me last time, but I may try again some day soon to see if they step up their game and can improve, as their management does seem to be very engaged and trying to do great.  Charlotte may be an A some days but a B- or lower others.  If they can tune things and get more consistent, I believe they can be an A all the time.  They just need to step it up a bit more across the board..."}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant and particular location a few times. They never disappoint in both service and food!  We celebrated Valentine's Day early here and had a fabulous meal consisting of filet mignon, wild mushrooms and creamed spinach. Unfortunately my meat wasn't cooked to my exact liking, but was still great. 

We also ordered cocktails that were fabulous, as always. Their drinks are on a different level than their food. Always phenomenal!  Wish the bar area was bigger. 

Unfortunately we were both too full for dessert. Our waiter, Mike, was super friendly and knowledgeable. Hoping to come back sooner rather than later!"}

{"text":"I was referred by Terri DeBoo.  Like all it recommendations?  It was THE BEST!

What's to say when everything was perfect?  Beautiful, clean, amazing service, unbelievable food, very accommodating with special requests.

On a scale of 1~10?  

I'll give it a 16"}
{"text":"I'm sure there are plenty of people that walk in & recognize a lot of the caricature's on the wall - old Charlottean's maybe?  and feel right at home.  I'm not one of them & hence the \"decor\" as such, was just oddball & not in a good way.

We went for happy hour & it's definitely an older crowd (I felt older there).  We sat at the bar & I guess we're spoiled by PPB across the way.  The bartender was ok, but was applying chapstick as she was taking our order which (we felt) was unprofessional.  

We had the Chicken Parmesan Sliders which we really enjoyed.  I had the Beefsteak Tomato Capri...the tomatoes were ripe & large with a large slice of buffalo mozzarella & a drizzle of basil oil (so they said, but it was just olive oil).  He had the small Caeser salad & added chicken.  The salad didn't look so good, but I didn't tell my honey that.  The romaine lettuce wasn't fresh-looking & the chicken was very dry.  The dressing was tasty, but a little mayonnaise-y.

The waiters old-style waiter's coats are an atrocious tan color and just look sloppy instead of crisp.  They wear aprons underneath these boxy coats which doesn't make sense.  

I'm so focused on the look and feel of the place because it was jarring to my senses. 

You can tell this restaurant relies on their \"regulars\" because if you aren't one - you're probably not coming back after the first time."}
{"text":"Another excellent meal and exquisite service at The Palm. Our intent was to share some appetizers over cocktails outside. Our excellent server, Melissa, mentioned the availability of prime rib and we instantly changed our plans from appetizers to a full dinner.

Shared appetizers were clams casino and calamari fritti. The clams were nice; but, the calamari was outstanding - tender as could be, lightly breaded, red and yellow pepper strips were scattered throughout - a nice counterbalance.

The prime rib was shared by two of us and was felt in your mouth delicious. And, for me, my real favorite, as always, the creamed spinach.

For dessert, the flourless chocolate cake and warm doughnuts were the perfect ending.

The wine, a Buckhorn cabernet, was excellent as were the cocktails.

But, the real highlight of the evening was the service. All of the staff was wonderful; but, Melissa was outstanding - her description of the food and the wine was sheer perfection, worthy of a slot on the Food Channel - so very descriptive!

An excellent evening on all counts!

Visited May 2015"}
{"text":"Today the office staff had a going away luncheon for a employee; I choose the fried calamari as a starter and the entr√©e Nova Lobster Salad  with an Arnold Palmer.

The calamari was a minute over cooked but great flavor and love the fried lemon slices, I shared with co-workers - NONE WAS LEFT.

When my salad was served my co-workers was in awesome, and said, we did see that on the menu, lol. it was great and plenty of lobster throughout. 

The Arnold Palmer was ok, but not sweet enough, it was off maybe to much lemonade.

I had the flourless chocolate cake to-go, left it at work for tomorrow, will let you know how it was.  All-in-All loved the spot and walking through the area."}
{"text":"I visited the Palm Restaurant for a business dinner with a vendor and had a very pleasant evening. Excellent service beginning to end. Good selection of appetizers, great lobster bisque soup, and a very well prepared New York Strip steak. New York style cheesecake (from New Jersey) finished the evening. I wasn't blown away, but I did leave very satisfied."}
{"text":"Two complaints:
1) I was told to wait at the bar or the lounge and that when the rest of my party came I would be notified and we would be seated.  This didn't happen.  I sat at the bar drinking and my party waiting for me and texted me and I had my phone on silent.  They waited at least 15 minutes for me the whole time I am at the bar wondering why they are taking so long.  I end up texting them to ask where they are and they tell me they are seated and wondering where I am.  Making four people wait on me is embarrassing and frustrating.  It also makes the night run late.

2) The half lobster in my surf and turf was overcooked and dry.  Not a little, but a lot.  I would have sent it back and really complained it should never have been plated it was so obviously bad.  I was with a party of people and in those cases I just eat it.  I ate some of it and someone at the table asked to try my lobster and I was glad to be rid of it.  They said it was dry too and gave the rest back to me.  This brings up a why didn't I complain and then I have to explain I didn't want to make a scene.  Well there is a scene made now and I didn't even get decent lobster because of it.

The lighting is way too dark and I could barely see anyone.

The positives:
The waitstaff - David was my waiter and I think David is excellent.  Not good, not proficient - excellent.  He had been there for years and knew everything.

I asked for my bread to be heated so the butter would melt - I am a weirdo and I don't like seeing un-melted butter on my bread.  The waiter understood me on the first request and very quickly took the bread and brought it back exactly how I like it.

The steak - the steak was done exactly as I wanted it.  It was a rib-eye and if you are bored and look at my other reviews I am all over Charlotte eating rib-eye steaks.  I try to eat them medium rare and that is a difficult way to cook a rib-eye and render all the fat.  Not a problem for the palm.

The drinks - whenever I got a drink (EtOH, ethanol aka alcohol) it was right.  Nothing was wrong - just the right amount of ingredients, salt and or sugar not too thickly crusted and not too thinly crusted.

The bartenders weren't excellent like the waiter.  Someone (not me) with me spilled her glass of wine.  She got very little on me, a moderate amount on herself, and a good bit on the bar.  Nobody came by to help us with the spill.  Nobody asked if we wanted a replacement (comp or paid).  This was a chance to shine.  The bar height is a bit off for women so your arms are in the wrong position or angle when seated so you may be prone to spill.

I might go back, but at this price I don't want to have to send something back.  I am spendthrift and the few times each month we go to a place like this we want it to be perfect.  If the Palm can be that place I would go back, but I am really not satisfied with what I consider two poor quality mess-ups."}
{"text":"I hate to be writing this..... we had high hopes for The Palm

I have paid for and eaten many bad meals, most of the bad have been at an average price range. Thankfully, I have researched most anniversary meals and faired well based on reviews. Tonight, we decided to eat my wife's uncle's favorite restaurants, despite the reviews. Granted he passed 10 years ago, as did their love for providing a top notch dinning experience, apparently. Tonight was the worst anniversary dinner by far, possibly top 5 worst dinners in the 18 years my wife and I have been together. Between the two of us we may have taken 14 bites from 7 plates. They did take off the \"prime\" rib eye that was like a brick. I can expand on every dish we ordered but honestly just would rather not. 

I don't speak out against businesses often, but The Palm is apparently putting a bad taste in many diners mouths these days."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Went this week, with my wife, for our anniversary.  She had a lobster and I had the ribeye.  I love the 3 cheese potatoes and my wife had a baked potato.  Everything was great, as usual.  From the moment you're greeted, to the time you leave, you always feel welcome.  The staff are professionals and have never had anything but great service.  By the way, you don't have to spend a lot to get a great meal.  Go for lunch and get an awesome burger.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I love The Palm. It's one of his favorite restaurants to go to in various cities and we were thrilled to have one close by once we moved to Charlotte. The service has always been excellent and the food reliable and delicious. The Gigi salad is one of my favorite salads ever. Everything I've ever consumed there has been great - the crab cakes, lobster, filet, calamari, etc. The crab cakes are packed with crab meat. The whipped potatoes are some of the best I've had.  The best dessert are the donut holes! They're delicious! They remind me of the churros at Disneyland - perfect! Quite honestly, I love the chicken tenders and fries they have for kids, too!"}
{"text":"I love a good upscale steakhouse and the palm delivers. I have only eaten here twice and will base my review on the bar service/dining experience alone. I sat at the bar on a Sunday night with Shannon the best bartender. She is so personable and just great at her job.  If you go before 7 any day of the week the bar food is discounted to a very reasonable rate. I tried the lobster roll and the steak sliders. Both pretty delicious. We also tried the beer carpaccio off the regular menu because I love beef carpaccio. A lot. A whole lot. The regular diner menu is a bit pricey but that's to be expected with these types of establishments. The carpaccio was amazing and the arugala salad on top of it was delicious. With the carpaccio I wish they didn't put grated parm on it (I felt it cheapened it-just go with the shaved fresh parm and call it done!) and there were no capers. I am used to having capers on carpaccio but to each his own. 

For dessert (which I usually skip) I went with Shannon's glowing recommendation of the doughnuts. Oh. My. God. They are hot and fresh and delicious. Rolled in cinnamon sugar they come with two dipping sauces and some whipped cream. These are made for splitting I would assume because there were a lot of holes. But so good. 

I loved this place and I will be back soon. Hopefully to sit in the dining room or at least give a steak a try!"}
{"text":"It's quite rare that hubs and I give a restaurant (or any business for that matter) varying star ratings. In fact, I really can't name one other business we've been to where our reviews span more than one star apart. Therefore, I'm surprised to say that, overall, The Palm didn't knock my socks off. Was it a nice meal? Yes. Was it worth the money? No. And here's the why to it all.

The place: The Palm Steakhouse, SouthPark, Charlotte-NC
The occasion: Our three-year wedding anniversary
The channel of reservation: Open Table
The scene: Beautiful night on the patio, very empty on a Monday evening

We made an Open Table reservation and noted that it was our wedding anniversary...it was a special night, not just a fly by for a quick steak. As mentioned, the patio is great although you really just look out into a wide driving lane that heads towards the Hampton Inn. 

Our server, Fernando, was top notch. Really, five stars for the service all the way around. Very formal but completely in tune with the cadence of the meal and the guest's needs. The food, however, is where I take issue...especially for the price.

Beefsteak tomato Capri salad: 4/5: Big slices of bright red tomato with hunks of fresh mozzarella and basil. Props to Fernando for lightly pouring on the oil and balsamic at the table. Nice touch. 

Chilean Sea Bass: 3/5: The fish was beautiful - really a great filet. However, I knew it would be sauteed in a white wine butter sauce, not swimmin' in it. The delicate fish was sitting in a pool and drowning in the sauce. 

Goat cheese whipped potatoes: 3/5: Fairly tasty mashed taters, but nothing out of the ordinary. I didn't taste too much of the goat cheese and they required a heavy hand of salt and pepper to liven them up. 

Creme brulee: 2/5: As some may know, I'm a total treat monster and the creme brulee came highly recommended. The flavors were bright - light with just a hint of citrus, but the bruleed top was ice cold and the middle of the creme was also super chilly. I have a feeling this was refrigerated for a long time and the texture and temperature suffered. 

Other notes: The shrimp cocktail is $18.90. Are you kidding me? That's insane. Also, there is not a petite filet...only a 9 oz. option for $43. This served as the reason why I went with fish instead of steak. I did, however, try a few bites of hubs' steak and it was cooked perfectly and was very well flavored. Additionally, I was a bit surprised that, considering the great service, no one wished us a happy anniversary in any way. 

Overall, our meal for two people, with a few drinks added in, came to $200. I'm completely fine shelling out some coin for a great meal, but The Palm fell short for me."}
{"text":"Buyer beware. This place use to be a fun place to go. First a couple of years ago some genius in management decided it was time to screw up the Palm Member card. They changed the rules so that the $7.00 lobster that they charge about $70.00 was taken away from the birthday gift. I  feel sure they lost more customers over this dumb move than they will ever get back. Then they try to re-charge you for a card you formerly had that was good from then on. Next they decided to resort to used car dealer tactics like slipping you a $14.00 glass of wine and upping it to $18. I was not a math major but 3 glasses at $18.00 and I could have bought 6 bottles of the 9 dollar wine at Total Wine The issue is the fast and slippery move from $14.00 glass to $18.00 glass feels cheesy. I was not expecting it from a place where I felt everybody knows your name. Friends don't let friends go to the Palm They have lost their way."}
{"text":"The Palm is an upscale steakhouse (with more than just steak!) that somehow maintains a laid back vibe. The caricatures on the wall of local \"celebrities\" and real celebrities are a great conversation piece. It keeps the mood light in an otherwise serious genre of restaurants. Let's get to the food. 

I have tried a number of things here. Their portions are large enough for a hungry male or 2 hungry females. Their steak options are always delicious-simply prepared, and really let the flavor of the meat shine. These steaks are not dolled up and pampered. The girl next door of meats. 

The bread basket is phenomenal. Love the seedy bread. I have split the crab cake entree with another female. These crab cakes are excellent. Not heavily breaded and served with a tasty mango salsa. Much like the meat, you are tasting the crab-as opposed to layers of butter/salt/misc. seasonings. For dessert, get the tiramisu. The lady fingers are soaked through, just the way I like them. 

They have a nice wine selection-love the Stag's Leap Cabernet. Service is great to boot!"}
{"text":"I have been to The Palm in L.A., and had an amazing dinner experience there.  I decided to go there for Thanksgiving dinner this year, as there were only two of us, and it's not worth the mess to cook for two.
This wasn't my first choice, but Sullivan's was not available.
The Palm had a Thanksgiving menu, or the regular menu was available.
Both of us went Thanksgiving.
The first course was great:  I had the arugula & apple salad, and my girlfriend had the lobster bisque.  Both were excellent.
Second course was the main entree:  sliced turkey breast, stuffing, cranberry sauce, gravy, plus our choice of veggie.  We had whipped potatoes and green beans.
Everything was very good.
The last course was dessert, which we got to go.  The choices were pumpkin or chocolate pecan pie.  We both chose the pecan pie.
At home later that evening, we learned that this dessert was nothing more than store-bought pumpkin pie with chocolate chips pressed into the top.  The crust was awful, and had the tell-tale pattern of a machine-made pastry.
Really?!
I am disappointed that a high-end steakhouse does not have a pastry chef.  I left The Palm in L.A. with a piece of carrot cake that was worth fighting over (or at least arm wrestling).  
You are not getting out of The Palm for less than $75 per person.  I was shocked that was the best they could do. 
Added frustration:  Thanksgiving is the day that everyone from age 80-120 has dinner at The Palm.  It is impossible get from A to B outside or inside the place.  
We'll go elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"We attended a great four course dinner paired with Tito's vodka drinks last night. The food was excellent and the drinks were very good but we were extremely disappointed that the Palm saw fit to add a 5% \"administration fee\" to our bill without prior notice.  The waiter said it was to cover other staff such as the hostesses but the explanation that came after we signed our bill was that it was to arrange for the dinner which we thought was sponsored  by Titos. A great night that left a bad taste due to the Palms stingy business practice."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I went here for a celebration lunch and I had a great meal and a great time. The quality of the food was excellent and the food service was very attentive. I would highly recommended this restaurant."}
{"text":"Back again for lunch yesterday with clients. An excellent experience from food to service."}
{"text":"Big deal steak house for Charlotte. I took my folks for their 50th wedding anniversary. I had a 14oz new york for $46 (over priced and not amazing), my pops had sea bass (why get fish at a steak joint?), my moms had the veal chop (which was the best tasting and best value at $36). We brought a nice bottle of wine which was $25 corkage but was not charge, thank goodness. All and all not worth the crazy prices for a not so fancy place but we did have excellent service and some good dishes. More of a guys night out on a business expense account."}
{"text":"My says \"best crab cakes south of Baltimore City."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a no muss, no fuss, excellently cooked steak, run to The Palm right now. I went for Summer Queen's Feast and I highly recommend it.

My plan all along was to have an All-American steak house meal. I started with the Caesar salad, which is not something I normally order, but I was pleased with the result. The romaine was crisp and sturdy, which showed that The Palm was not skimping on freshness or flavor just because it was restaurant week. There was a generous amount of cheese and croutons, which I am a huge fan of, and the Caesar dressing was creamy and slightly acidic and didn't drown my lettuce.

For my main I went with the obvious choice and ordered the twin tenderloin filet medallions. My steak hit the spot; it was perfectly rare in the middle, and had shallot butter generously melted on top (with some crispy onions as well). I love it when chefs have an in depth knowledge of meat temperatures (just talking about it is getting me excited) and whoever cooked my steak at The Palm definitely knew what they were doing. 

The one downside about the restaurant week menu was that it did not include a side dish with our main courses; but for only $3 a person, we ordered a family style side of Brussels sprouts, which were almost as amazing as my steak. The Brussels sprouts were bathed in a delicious lemon brown butter; and the tanginess of the lemon, coupled with richness of the brown butter, perfectly offset the Brussels sprouts natural funkiness (or should we say bitterness? Sour taste?). I would eat those over and over again.

To complete my three course meal, I ended with the classic New York cheesecake (but stole a taste of my friend's Key Lime Pie, because I was having such a hard time deciding). The cheesecake was good; it was creamy, light (sometimes cheesecakes can turn dense), and not too sweet. But after a sort of heavy, on heavy, on heavy meal, I wasn't able to finish it all (it still made a great snack the next afternoon).

{"text":"Made a visit during Charlotte restaurant week. My first time to the Palm here in Charlotte, though I have frequented the New York location on 2nd Avenue.

Tremendous value for $30 per person.  Many have commented on the crab cakes, and indeed they are full of crab meat and little filling.  However, this is still a Steakhouse in my opinion and they do them right.  The cuts are always very high quality and the preparation to your exact specifications.  

The sides here are generous and to be shared.  The desserts always good.  Lastly, I have always had outstanding service in NY and Charlotte did not disappoint."}
{"text":"The Palm is first class all the way. If you want a mildly casual yet extravagant lunch, this is the place to go. The atmosphere is somewhat country club-esque with rich wood trims and place settings. Caricatures line the walls making things less stuffy. 

As for the food, I had an amazing salad to start followed by the sea bass which was served over a heavy cream sauce. I finished with coffee and ended up taking home a piece of double chocolate flowerless cake for later. The cake was great by the way! In fact, the meal was great. I can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately my first visit to The Palm was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. I'm not one to write negative reviews, but this was just that bad. Firstly, the service was pretty good. Certainly not excellent, but it was good. Myself and two girlfriends ordered a bottle of wine, which was excellent, but that's where it stopped. We ordered several appetizers that were awful. The tuna was not fresh and after each of us had a bite we didn't eat it. The same goes for the calamari which was rubbery and extremely salty- the \"marinara\" was cold and flavorless. We wondered if they had just opened a can of tomatoes and put them in a dish. The lobster mac and cheese was awful as well. Luke warm, the pasta was over cooked and the was NO lobster at all in the dish. To say the least, we expected much more from a fine dining restaurant with prices like these. After the awful apps we didn't dare order an entree. Lastly, after dinner we went to the restroom where there was a man in there cleaning. We asked if we could enter and he replied \"that's up to you\". We obviously waited outside of the door while he continued to clean. Why wouldn't he stop what he was doing to allow us to enter, then continue when we left?? After we were made to wait about 5 min, we entered the restroom and a few min later he knocked on the door, opened it, and asked if we were done. I was touching up my makeup since we where headed somewhere else for drinks because we were ready to leave. I immediately left the restroom and we left the restaurant. To say the least we were all shocked at how bad this experience was."}
{"text":"We had another fantastic experience at the Palm recently. This time I tried the blue cheese & bacon burger. It did not disappoint! Once again Holly, our server, was top notch!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times over the years and The Palm never lets us down. A classic NY steakhouse that doesn't mess with a good thing. Incredible steaks, lobster, drinks... pretty much everything on the menu. Their lunch is also surprisingly reasonably priced and excellent as well."}
{"text":"I dine at this restaurant frequently.  I have never gotten anything bad and the service has always been top notch.  A great place to eat!"}
{"text":"The Palm is one of our favorite restaurants in the area.  WE try to make it at least once a month.   There are a lot of steak places in the area, but we have always been treated like royalty at The Palm.  From the hostess to the wait staff, everyone goes out of their way to have a friendly relationship.

The portions are huge, the sides are meant for sharing.

We usually go for the filet mignon or a 4 lb Lobster.  We try to avoid the larger 6 lb'ers as they can be a little tough.

The West Coast Gigi Salad is a classic -  highly recommended. 

Ask for Johnny!  Our favorite server at The Palm."}
{"text":"One of the better meals I've had in CLT. I gotta go back before I can give an accurate picture."}
{"text":"The interior is dated and the food was underwhelming. The prices are steep for the quality of food, would not recommend based off the prices alone."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first experience, what a pleasant surprise. Our waitress was great. She was very attentive and got us whatever was needed quickly. First we ordered a couple of glasses of prosecco while we decided what we wanted. We both settled on the 9oz filet. I requested mine medium rare, while the other was medium. Mine was a true medium rare, juicy and pink  in my opinion, perfect. We had Caesar salads, three cheese mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach. Now, normally I wouldn't order creamed spinach, but I am SO glad we did, it was INCREDIBLE! I recommend you get it. We then enjoyed dessert, carrot cake and cheesecake, both were incredible! We had a fantastic experience for Valentine's Day and plan to return soon! Thanks Palm Staff for making our visit incredible!"}
{"text":"I have heard great things about the Palm and I think it is somewhat of a staple here in Charlotte but I have to say it honestly didn't live up to the hype in my opinion.
I think your experience will depend upon your reasoning for choosing this restaurant..
For example, we chose this to celebrate our anniversary and it just didn't satisfy me.  It was rather loud in the restaurant in general, the hostess was friendly but nothing special, it wasn't romantic and they really didn't do anything to make you feel like you were a special guest.

We were seated in a private room initially so I was excited and hopeful.  However, our bread had not hit the table before another couple was seated RIGHT beside us.  Then, within 30 minutes 2 more tables were occupied including a family of 5.  The kids were like toddlers--WHY are they in there?

Moving on...the waitress was super friendly, her \"assistant\" didn't speak english but she was helpful.  The waitress was extremely knowledgeable and really knew the menu quite well.  She even suggested a few things that were not listed on the menu.  I liked the fact that they offered 9 oz pours for the wine and they had a pretty extensive wine variety.  

My husband ended up ordering the Filet and I ordered the crab cakes because I was told these are their house specialty!  We ordered the goat cheese mashed potatoes and broccoli for our sides.  

I thoroughly enjoyed the crab cakes.  Were they worth almost $40?  Not even close.  It was three small little crab clusters.  They were void any fillers which I appreciated and packed with good quality crab meat.  They were great but not worth taking out a loan over..  

The steak my husband ordered was decent but again nothing special.  The flavoring that they recommended he try was a peppercorn/olive oil sauce.  The steak honestly shouldn't need this additional flavoring but it did in this case.  It was a little chewy and it didn't melt in your mouth!  It was not flavored well on its own.  I honestly think a Ruth Chris' steak is much better!  Again, this just wasn't worth the $50 it cost.

The sides were good although there was nothing about the potatoes that tasted like goat cheese...they were just very good and creamy mashed potatoes.  The broccoli had great flavor and was cooked perfectly--not too crunch and not soggy--just how I like it!

We didn't have time for dessert (catching a play uptown) but their menu looked decent.  We were told to try their donuts.  I'm sure they are good.  I think it would have been nice if they offered a free dessert or something special because it was our anniversary.  

Roundup?  I expected more, especially for the price point.  I'm telling you I can go into Ruth's or Sullivans or Terra and many other restaurants that are not as expensive and have a better overall dining experience.  I can't figure out why someone would choose the Palm over all the other great steakhouses in the area.  They are more expensive and offer less quality and a worse environment.  I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"You know what to expect when you go to the Palm: excellence. Tonight lived up to it. 

We arrived before our friends so we enjoyed a cocktail at the bar. I let the server pick for me and she didn't steer me wrong. A pomegranate martini kicked off the evening on a great start. Sweet, but not too sweet, it was so tasty. Hubby had a Long Island Iced tea and was also pleased. So pleased he had another one at the table. 

Our server was amazing. With over 20 years of experience, he was attentive and guided us to perfect selections. I started with lobster bisque. It was perhaps the most smooth bisque I have ever had.  One word comes to mind: silk. There were ample pieces of almost minced sweet lobster. If the remainder of the night would be like this bisque, I was in for a treat. 

Our server informed us that the Palm's crab cakes have been voted the best for 20 years. How could I resist? I can tell you that they've earned this distinction. Lump, sweet crab meat with absolutely no filler left me wondering what was holding these massive crab cakes together. My friends had joked while we were waiting that my THREE crab cakes would probably be the size of quarters. They were wrong! I was pleasantly surprised at how large all three crab cakes were. Score! 

For sides, our table chose lobster Mac and cheese, creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin. I was too stuffed to try the potatoes but the creamed spinach was very good as was the lobster Mac and cheese. Be warned, there is bacon in the lobster Mac and cheese so after two bites, I had to let that go. 

Too full for dessert, we had to pass on a burnt caramel brownie that our server said was to die for. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I recently visited the Palm for my birthday and can say I was impressed with both the food and service.  
We made reservations and arrived beforehand to enjoy a drink in the bar. The bar was packed with others enjoying cocktails and appetizers.  We were seated in a corner, not the greatest table, but were addressed for water, tap, sparkling, etc. and a bread basket of fresh breads from Great Harvest. 
After reviewing the menu, we started with the crab cake and shrimp appetizer. The crab cake was AMAZING! Jumbo lump crab with very little filling served with a mango salsa on the side. The shrimp was butterflied and breaded and then dredged in a mustard sauce, good, but didn't stand up to the crab cake.
As for our entrees, I went with the 9 oz. filet and added a 1/2 lobster tail, for their surf and turf option and my guest got the Prime Rib special. We ordered Brussel Sprouts to share.
The filet melted in my mouth, one of the best I have ever had. As for the lobster, would probably pass next time. A little overcooked for me.  The Prime Rib was also amazing and served a great homemade horseradish dip.  No comment on the brussel sprouts, just ok.

Being my birthday we ordered the flourless chocolate cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Unfortunately they forgot it was my birthday, although I was told they made them aware when the reservations were made. The cake was good, but a little too rich for me.
Throughout the night the service was spot on, even though the restaurant was packed. I was surprised to see a lot of guests, from families, to couples, etc.  I guess it is more of a go to spot than I thought.
Overall we enjoyed our dinner and would definitely come back for another special occasion, especially with the price. Ha Ha!"}
{"text":"Calling this place an Italian restaurant is a misnomer.  It's really just a steak house, so prepare yourself for lots of meat!  

I arrived here for a business dinner around 6:30.  My entire party had not arrived, so I decided to hang out at the bar.  My coworker and I were by far the youngest at the bar (and he's in his 30's)!  Think old guys in suits with white hair drinking Glenlivet....  Not necessarily a bad thing, but probably not the best spot you'd like to take a date.

We were promptly seated at a booth, and the hostess, waitress, and busgirl were all extremely pleasant and polite.  The waitress had some great recommendations as well, she knew her stuff.

One of the guys eating with me was a wine snob, so we got some outrageously expensive bottle of Cabernet to begin with.  It was delicious, but geez!  I had the tomato capri (which really was just a caprese salad) which was really delicious and the mozzarella was very creamy and yummy.  My colleagues had the lobster bisque soup (which they seemed to enjoy very much) and the tomato and onion salad, which was also very well prepared.

3 of us ordered the 10 oz. filet mignon (which no one finished by the way, I wouldn't recommend anything bigger unless you are a big eater).  It had a wonderful flavor, and was VERY well prepared.  A great steak.  Not that it shouldn't have been, considering JUST the steak (no sides mind you) cost $34.

For sides, we had the fried asparagus, sauteed green beans, mashed potatoes, potatoes au gratin, and sauteed mushrooms.  They all tasted great, but considering the price of each side (approx $10) the portions were VERY small.

Finally we had the cheesecake!  It was from some famous bakery in Jersey, though the name of it escapes me at the moment.  Very fresh, and delicious.

So why only 4 stars?

1.  Decor - They have painted faces on the wall of all of the celebrities that have dined there, and it's extremely tacky looking.
2.  Price - For the cost, I just didn't see the value.  The steak was the best I've ever had, but that was the only thing that was phenomenal about this crowd.  The bill was $500+ with tip, so beware.
3.  The Crowd - It's kind of old and dowdy in there.  I was the youngest person in the place, and also one of the only females dining there.

Great place for a business dinner, but I might go elsewhere if looking for a place to dine with family or friends."}
{"text":"Came here late (after 9pm) for their bar bites special ($5.50 each). I haven't been here in a while and as expected nothing has changed.  I sat at the bar, was greeted promptly.  I understand it was close to closing time, so I don't mind or care that my bartender was busy closing up shop... But on the other hand, this is an upscale place and would have been nice to experience the exceptional. 
I ordered the lobster salad sliders.  It was good.  The 3 little things was enough to fill me up as late dinner.  There's enough lump lobster meat (can always have more) and the arugula adds a nice flavor. The crispy potato chips was a great edible garnish. 
I also ordered a mojito from their classic cocktails menu.  Unfortunately that was not good.  It was so tart I could taste the lime AFTER my meal as I was on my way home.  Is it so hard to find a good mojito in Charlotte?  I just expected their classics to be solid choices, oops.  
I will be back, I have my eyes on the crabcakes. But next time I will not be ordering any drinks that has any lime juice in it...I just had a chill thinking of that mojito.  

Side note: I just remember that they serve their drinks with a custom stirrer in the shape of a palm tree... You know how rare that is?  My aunt used to collect them, when each hotel/lounge/bar had their own design."}
{"text":"We finally got to The Palm for our monthly fancy dinner with friends. I was very excited to try this place as I had heard that it was a fun place to eat. I had also been warned about the food. It's a shame but both of the things I had heard were correct. The atmosphere and servers are great. Our waiter knew his stuff and worked with us to find the perfect meals for each couple. He was friendly, energetic, and a great salesman. We decided on the filet and lobster surf and turf. Then the food came... It just wasn't that good. Of all of our high dollar dinner nights this was the most expensive and the food was the worst. The steaks had no flavor and the lobster was overcooked. I had to ask for steak sauce to finish my steak. I look forward to a great steak when I am going to spend over $100 a person. The service is the only reason I am even giving them 2 stars so if you want to spend a ton of money on a bad meal with a talented wait staff this is your place. If you are someone who needs to spend a bunch of money for a steak go to Outback and leave your server a $100 tip. At least that way you'll enjoy your steak."}
{"text":"Excellent steaks. Definitely a good place to entertain or for special occasions. Bar area is too tight. Spendy $$$$ for sure but very good service and quality.  I can't quite give 5 stars due to bar area but great food if you are looking for traditional upscale steak fare."}
{"text":"Prime rib a 4.5, Grouper is outstanding, Steaks are 3.5 sometimes 4 (but always cooked perfectly), good (but overpriced wine list), sides are typical steakhouse...BUT.

Service is absolutely outstanding.    Whether it has been a client dinner, my step mothers birthday, or a nice dinner with the kids the service just rocks."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting from Florida and had lunch at the The Palm.
I don't know when I have ever enjoyed such a meal. The food was exquisite and the service superb! Our servers name was Dalton and he made sure that our every need was met. 
I strongly suggest everyone visit this establishment at least once. I can guarantee you will return for more."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend and sat at the bar... Christie is an absolute gem!  Even if my steak medallions weren't delicious (which they were!!), I'd keep coming back for her incredible service and \"real\" conversation.  What a treat!

Back to my steak... I'm a horrible person and eat my beef medium-well; it was cooked perrrrfectly!  It was still tender and juicy.  The mashed potatoes were heavenly and seasonal vegetable (broccoli) was very flavorful.. Yes, broccoli can have flavor!!

Then you have drinks and dessert... I had a couple \"Seasonal Mules.\"  It's currently fresh blueberries muddled with Grey Goose - Where else can you get a Goose-heavy beverage for $11?!  No where near South Park, that's for sure!
And the key lime pie... Don't say no!  Not overly sweet, not too much lime, and the crust isn't perfect.  So, you know it's home or locally made - which is what makes it perfect!

If you're willing to splurge a little bit for a 5-Star local lunch, this is your place!  Great location, great food, supeeeerb service... will definitely return :-D"}
{"text":"I've been to other Palm Restaurants and the food is always wonderful but in this one the food was good but it was just  . . . LOUD! tile floor lots of people crammed into tables that are far too close together. So again, great food, but do your talking and visiting on the walk around Phillips Place after dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent. Loved the chopped salad and great service at the bar. Steak was cooked to perfection. My go to place for a great lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"It was just OK! I ordered the Filet Mignon medium well, and it came back medium rare...uugh! The mashed potatoes were watered down and the green beans taste like plastic. The place is overpriced for the food that you get. You are better off going to Capital Grille, Ruth Chris or Sullivan's...I digress"}
{"text":"I ate at this location on Mother's Day after reading about the history of the Palm, and it's particular success and development of the New York strip. I ordered the New York strip, and it was the worst steak I've ever been served in a restaurant. I'm pretty sure the person in the kitchen forgot to salt and pepper the meat before cooking it. I took the time to write a very detailed e-mail to their customer service address, and never heard a word back."}
{"text":"OK... I think I'm sold that Palm is my favorite Steakhouse in Charlotte.  Basically, I like most all of the high end joints so, it's a close race but after my second Palm visit, I have to give it up to them.  

My wife and I took her parents and her sister there last night as one of her dad's birthday presents.  Everyone was very happy with all they ate.  Detail wise, I'll stick to just my meal for this review.  Took advantage of one of the summer specials and went with the Filet and Lobster tail.  This also came with a choice of a starter and a side and yes, of course I super-sized the steak and tail once I found out I could!

For the starter I had the lobster bisque which was poured table side.  It was hot, creamy and delicious although it did require the addition of a tad bit of salt at the table.  The steak came cooked to a perfect medium-rare with a great crust on it and the lobster tail was as big as my head and very moist and flavorful.  Had the three cheese potatoes au gratin for the side.  It was cheesy and good though it also benefited from a wee bit of table-side salt.

Service was once again friendly and impeccable and they are very accommodating to various special requests.

Can't wait to go back next time!"}
