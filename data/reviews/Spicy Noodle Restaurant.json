{"text":"Very very nice!  I love the spicy chicken and the sweet sour soup. Excellent quality and reasonable price and I will definitely visit once more"}
{"text":"There's literally only two reasons to ever go to the Galeries du Parc. One of them is the Cinéma du Parc, probably the best rep house in the city, and the Spicy Noodle. Fast, dirt cheap and delicious.  Location's a bit weird, but if you're in the McGill Ghetto area, there's no reason to swing by."}
{"text":"I actually feel bad for those who think this is good Chinese cuisine. 
Where to start? I am used to Chinatown restaurants or Cuisine auntdai by cote des neiges, which are some of the best in town. 
When ordering from Spicy Noodle, the menu is huge and lots of options to customize.
Cons: unclean kitchen. Lack of ingredients in the food (for 12$ I want more than plain noodles and plain chicken with no veggies or sauce)
Meat is tasteless unfortunately, probably not marinated for 24hrs like regular Chinese cuisine. 
The plates are huge but that is because you are getting a mountain of either rice or noodles. This is fine since most places like this are known for giving little to no meat. The problem here is that even that mountain of rice or noodles, topped with a bit of meat and nothing else (other than bean sprouts) is kind of tasteless... 
Was let down since a lot of people buy from this place.

Do not recommend to the actual Chinese food lover/connaisseur.
Great for overpriced mall food. It ruined my day and my wallet, but there were no other options nearby...."}
{"text":"Best general Tao chicken in town,literally! I've had it at  some other high end Chinese resto, nowhere is better than here. If you're into this kind of Chinese Canadian food, go for it, btw their portion are big too."}
{"text":"My bf and i have been here several times since we moved here two weeks ago and i have not disliked anything we've had thus far.  Very basic Chinese food, all the normal things you would expect to find. The entrees are very savory and dense, and the portion sizes are very good for the price. 

I was surprised to see they deliver and I'll definitely be utilizing that service during the colder months."}
{"text":"Gigantic menu full of confusing words. 
NO CHICKEN BALLS? 
Took 3 hours to arrive, driver followed me inside after I forgot to tip. Very intrusive behaviour, if you ask me. 
Would not dine here again, my wife said she wouldn't dine there again either. The most interesting part of the meal was the bowl of tears I eventually collected during the long wait. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Huge menu of approximately 160 dishes to choose. Actually the way this restaurant works is to use about 10 different sauces to stir-fry different combinations of meat and vegetables. There is no taste in their food, and the meat is not fresh. In addition, their kitchen's sanitation is a strong problem, I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I really really like their general tao chicken. It's moisty and crunchy and affordable. The rice is a little too dry for my taste. They make very good peanut butter dumplings too :) i recommend this place for a quick bite to eat :)"}
{"text":"Good quality asian food at a reasonable price. 
The ambience is friendly & a recommended place for a quick eat or takeout."}
{"text":"Hits the spot when you want it. Stick to one option (your favourite). Mine is the H, which is an unhealthy and heavily breaded general Tao chicken. But it's cheap and the portion is huge and it hits the spot when I need it to. Do not recommend coming here more than twice a week. Really nice girl works the front, service is generally decent. A sinful pleasure."}
{"text":"Portions are HUGE! Which is kind of a bummer since I want to try some of their dishes but know I can't finish one on my own. I work near by so for lunch I'm always looking for something quick and tasty. 

This place usually does the trick, they're friendly and fast. I can order dumplings, rice, spring rolls, basically any entree and it's enough to tide me over. I order 2-3 entrees and I find that it fills me up for 5-6 hours depending on what it is.

I find that the fried wontons can be a bit too greasy, but otherwise good. The dumplings are decent but only if eaten warm (don't let them sit out for too long) they have a good flavour and texture but they feel a bit rubbery depending on the day. The spring rolls are basic but still crunchy with crisp flavours. 

Overall, not a bad place to stop in my opinion. I wouldn't really consider it authentic but that's the point when you go somewhere like this for Chinese food. You want cheap, abundant, fill you up till you throw up, americanized Chinese food. 

I think it's great that they deliver. It's honestly some really good comfort Chinese food. But don't go out of your way to visit.

I really want to try the General Tao chicken though! Will have to stop by with my boyfriend some day."}
{"text":"I love their general tao chicken! Portions are huge and the price is very reasonable.
I ordered eight meals for my work colleagues and was pleasantly surprised that every order was correct and all the food was still fresh. Plus, the delivery guy showed up within 40 mins. I still think they're one of the best Chinese restaurants in Montreal."}
{"text":"I've had the kung pao chicken, beef with black bean sauce, several dumpling types, hot and sour soup, curry noodles, and singapore noodles. The kung pao chicken was ok. I wouldn't get the beef with black bean sauce again. I felt it was pretty much all rice. I also don't like their dumplings very much. The filling doesn't have a very good flavor. The hot and sour soup was very, very vinegary. The curry noodles were ok. I think they could have been cooked longer. Everyone liked the singapore noodles They were probably the best. Followed by the kung pao chicken. The employees are nice and the food is cooked quickly"}
{"text":"My favourite Asian fast-food restaurant. I love the staff that works here. They always have a smile on their faces and that provides me with a sense of warmth. The food is really warm too! My favourite dishes are Pad Thai and Fried Rice. There was one time my food was too salty, they gave me a new one forthwith!"}
{"text":"mmmm got the kung pao chicken, alot of food for a reasonable price. the chicken was very crunchy, would prefer more meat. still gooooood."}
{"text":"Finally Yelp has approved this page as I tried to review them last year. This is the closest Chinese place to me and I've been using them for a little over a year now. I am not fond of the general shopping area location which always smells like a mixture of cleaning chemicals and popcorn from Cinema du Parc. The wonton soup is alright but I prefer a beef broth to the chicken one which I think they use. Otherwise, the food is greasy and more than I'd like to pay. In the chicken with broccoli, you can literally see the oil in the sauce. Portions are also too big, share if you are going to order one of the main dishes, but this tends to be typical of Chinese places. You can dine there but you'll be sitting very close to the counter and if you come there at night, you will be sitting close to the hobos who come into the shopping area from outside. I have yet to find Chinese food (and pizza) that I like in Montreal and I suppose I will continue the search which has proved futile. Chinese food and pizza is one of the reasons I will be moving back to New York next year."}
{"text":"It's 8pm and you've worked the whole day. You're tired, hungry and are looking to indulge in food you wouldn't usually eat if your willpower wasn't so low. 

Order Spicy Noodles! They have a huge variety so they probably have what you are shamefully craving. The service is quick and friendly and they have delivery if you can't be bothered to leave. My top choices for vegetarians are:

1) Veggie Lo Mein
2) Tofu in Peanut Sauce
3) Veggie Fried Rice

Warning: avoid foods with the bamboo shoots bc they used the tinned variety and it smells funky"}
{"text":"Try their \"General Tao's batter\". I ordered General Tao's chicken with steamed rice. I am shocked by the lack of meat. It's 99% batter and 1% meat and I am being generous. This is basically deep fried batter tossed in General Tao sauce."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff for the price, and orders are pretty fast, they delievered the stuff with 20 minutes, not bad. I always go there whenever I'm grocery shoppng. I love their dumplings, especially the shrimp one. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am in Montreal for business I stay at a hotel close by. When I have a craving for quick authentic Chinese food I come here.  They are as authentic as you can get for a 'fast food counter'.

These folks serve so many people during the day it is not difficult to see why their food is fresh and tasty.

In the grand scale they are good, not the best, but I won't hold it against them."}
{"text":"Great food in the McGill area. 
Freshly prepared and has a hint of authentic taste. Much better commercial ripoffs like Thai Express. 

Definitely recommend for a quick meal on a budget."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that you could walk by 100 times and never think to give it a try. If you're one of those people, you're definitely missing out! Spicy Noodle Restaurant is essentially one of those hole-in-the-wall type restaurants in Les Galleries du Parc. I honestly cannot believe that I haven't tried it after having lived downtown Montréal for so many years.

A newfound comfort food obsession of mine is vegetable fried rice and I have finally found my go-to restaurant. The employees are all super nice and friendly. Moreover, they are extremely accommodating when it comes to allergies and/ or food restrictions. The portions are massive and the prices are beyond reasonable. The menu seems to be quite large, having options for all types of eaters and foodies. This establishment also has a delivery option, which I will probably take advantage of over the winter months.

All in all, I couldn't be happier that I came across this restaurant. Great comfort food and even better service."}
{"text":"They are located at Sherbrooke & Parc and they say that delivery to Mont Royal & St Denis is 'way too far!': Spicy Noodle; you are officially on my shit list."}
{"text":"Damn damn damn, this is one of the times I really wish the increment between ratings would be closer. Overall 3.5/5.

Food:
Typical canadian-chinese food of cantonese decent. Items include the famous (arguably infamous) general tao chicken, sesame beef, shanghai noodles, pad sew, probably singapore noodles as well, and a whole lot of stir fry. 

The portions are...disproportionally filling. I consider my appetite to be top tier, but I died (not literally) after the 3/4. It took me another 15min to finish the dish. 

I'm not going into the debate on authenticity of this particular restaurant, as I'm sure we've all had this kind of chinese fusion cuisine on many occasions. What I will comment on is the taste. Good flavours, too salty, and greasy sauce. Score for taste is 3.5/5. 

Price:
Very appealing to people living on student budget. Eum, it ranges in the neighbourhood of 10$, but as aforementioned, it could fill up the stomach of a hangry sumo (don't quote me on this). 

Other:
Somewhat efficient service. Food court style seating. I did see a fruit fly around my table at some point... not sure where it's from (could be from the shopping center)."}
{"text":"If you're a broke college student like myself you need to try Spicy Noodle. For many years I passed by spicy noodle without wanting to try it, I thought it was just another expensive and mediocre food court restaurant but I was SO wrong. I randomly stopped here on a late Wednesday night and I was thoroughly impressed with my meal. My favorite dish is #132, the flat rice noodle with shrimp and lobster sauce (with no bean sprouts). The portion size is HUGE, they don't skimp on the amount of shrimp they put in a dish, and it's extremely affordable. 

I've also had the orange beef and the sesame beef but I'm not the hugest fan of those meals-- they're both on the more greasy side. When going to Spicy Noodle I definitely recommend trying the noodles over the fried food like the orange beef, general Tao chicken, etc"}
{"text":"Petit comptoir et resto chinois , saveur succulant, bon service , livraison , tout pour etre satisfait,  meme avec le prix."}
