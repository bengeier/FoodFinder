{"text":"I give them 2.5 because I don't really like their coffee - too acidic and sour tasting for me. The cafe itself is quite chic and has a cool hipster vibe that is characteristic of Montreal. Close to St. Laurent and McGill, you can find a lot of people working here at times so it might be hard to get a seat. The cafe is popular within the St Laurent Boulevard area, but I prefer Pikolo Espresso Bar on Parc Ave."}
{"text":"Great coffee, all brewed to a high level of perfection. They were using beans from a Halifax roaster the times I went in. They have a nice variety of baked goods inside. The interior is quite pretty, with some cool magazines and stylish tables."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere. One of a handful of great cafés in the neighbourhood, probably none of the prettiest to hang out in."}
{"text":"Bad service, but ok coffee. The cookies were pretty good. The staff rubbed me the wrong way twice: when I walked, they acted too cool / pretentious to be warm or friendly -- reminds me of Toronto in the worst way. Then they ignored me because the guy with the beard was on his phone. Wouldn't go again because there are way friendlier cafes in Montreal with just as good coffee and ambiance!"}
{"text":"Best cappuccino in Montreal! The space is very small but not cramped. Seems to be a student hangout/good place to study. Baristas were extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Kitsuné est un nouveau café ouvert par François Beauregard sur Prince-Arthur. Kitsuné veut dire renard en japonais. Et j'aime les renards. Et j'aime les beaux cafés. Je ne pouvais qu'aimer le Kitsuné. 

Tout en brique et bien caché, le Kitsuné est une antre de paix sur la Main. C'est calme, c'est plein de jolies personnes qui travaillent ou lisent le journal avec leur café. Et je ne peux pas commenter le café puisque j'ai bu du thé au jasmin qu'ils servent dans une théière en fonte ce qui est vraiment apprécié!

Petit tip : vous pouvez stationner vos vélos à l'intérieur. Ça rajoute au charme du café. C'est sûr que je vais revenir pour m'y prendre un bout de table!"}
{"text":"I've been on the search in montreal for a place with a great chai latte, and this is it.  They actually brew the tea from scratch as opposed to using a mix.  The tea is strong, with bite, and most importantly, not sweet!  You can actually choose how sweet you want your chai to be.  Great stuff. Didn't hurt that they were playing my favorite tunes when I walked in, plus they have crazy good scones.  I will be back."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.
They have limited options for coffee, but this is fine because what they do have is delicious (except the chai latte - but that might just be my own personal taste). The prices are fair for an independent café and the staff is the best! It is a great place to study with GREAT music. I can stay here all day studying by the window:) It is also very quiet so it is perfect for someone wanting peace to do work or read.
DON'T come here if you are with a loud group."}
{"text":"Love this café. It's very close to where I live and it's not so expensive. They have amazing rich coffee and their chai tea latte is to die for. 


I definitely recommend getting their chai tea iced. I'm very picky with chai tea lattes. I hate them at almost every café BUT Kitsune's! It's very rich and creamy. It's to die for, especially when it's iced! Even talking about it now makes me want to go and get it.... Ok I'm definitely going to get it.

Oh, and the wifi is great and the café is visually appealing.

As for the seating.. The chairs are not that comfortable and it gets crowded pretty fast. There is a seating area in the back outside so that's a plus. But laptops are definitely welcomed!"}
{"text":"Situé en bordure du secteur très glamour de la rue Saint-Laurent à la hauteur de la rue Prince-Arthur, métro Sherbrooke, ce petit café tout nouveau ne pèche pas par manque de personnalité. On remarque en rentrant la très longue table de bois massif où les clients s'assoient dans une nécessaire esprit de communauté, le nombre de chaises hautes l'entourant forçant un jeu de coude auquel tout le monde se prête gentiment et de façon sophistiquée, le tout dans l'ambiance particulière de ce coin de la ville. Ha oui, vos oreilles ne frisent pas, ici on parle dans les deux langues, alors c'est le temps de sortir votre bilinguisme pour le partager avec vos voisins. Le serveur par contre vous sert dans un français irréprochable.

Si vous venez y flâner, en plus de profiter d'un merveilleux café, vous partagerez votre espace avec des étudiants du ghetto de l'Université McGill, quelques travailleurs au profil plus cool que business, munis d'ordinateurs et de tablettes électroniques qui sont sûrement à une pointe de la technologie beaucoup plus fine que la vôtre, à moins que ce ne soit votre âge qui vous trahisse? Quoiqu'il en soit, vous devriez venir plus souvent, car c'est ici que ça se passe! 

La carte est très simple, imprimée en très gros caractères blanc sur noir sur le mur de vieilles briques derrière le comptoir, et ne vous en faites pas, le serveur qui coure dans toutes les directions est aussi là pour vous. 

Ce n'est pas le meilleur endroit pour travailler tranquille dans votre bulle. Rendez-vous y surtout si vous avez le goût de simplement \" chiller \" tranquille le temps d'un café, discuter avec des amis croisés sur Saint-Laurent, prendre au maximum une page de note dans votre carnet. Vous ne serez pas déçu, surtout par le café! 

Points bonis: les lampes de style \"steampunk\", les vieilles machines à écrire et le sas dans l'entrée pour y garer votre bicyclette (à l'intérieur!). Il y a aussi une carte très limitée mais excellente de thés servis dans une théière en fonte individuelle, à votre table. 

Il y a du stationnement dans les rues transversales et parallèles, mais gare aux restrictions écrites en petits caractères sur les panneaux!"}
{"text":"Mignon, très détendu et amical. Le café était excellent, le choix de petites pâtisseries est alléchant et l'ambiance au final très paisible et conviviale, parfaite pour travailler. Aussi le genre d'endroit où employés et clients sont heureux de faire connaissance et discuter. Seule petite chose, la lumière est assez tamisée, ça en dérangera peut-être certains pour lire ou travailler sur papier (moi ça allait par contre)."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding.  The two guys running it when we visited were really friendly, genuine and down to earth.

The muffins (sweet potato, apples, brown sugar, nuts) were amazing.  The yogurt with black cherry and granola was sublime and was made on premises.  We also ordered orange juice and watched them squeeze the fruits to make it.

My cappuccino was excellent; my wife had peach-vanilla (?) tea which was also great.

We rarely give 5 star reviews but this experience, the ambiance (check out the back room al fresco custom-made benches seating area), and the service made the cut.

And - loved the 3D school map of the world hanging on the wall!"}
{"text":"Le latte était tout simplement exquis ! Un des meilleurs espresso en ville avec celui du Théâtre Ste-Catherine. La chocolatine était bonne, mais le super beau biscuit au double choco m'a déçue. Il manquait de goût et était très sec... j'y retournerai pour un latte c'est sûr ! (Bon service aussi en passant)"}
{"text":"Decent coffee, but not great. Ok blend, but watered down by relatively average milk. Was hoping for more.
Hardly any space to sit as there were almost more laptops than seats."}
{"text":"Excellent latte avec un dessin de cur avec la bonne musique espagnol très intéressante place près de la rue st-Laurent un bon stop avant de allez travailler"}
{"text":"Great vibe and perfect location.   A combo hipster meets startup meets the rest of us kinda place :)"}
{"text":"Dropped in earlier this morning for a latté to go. Was welcomed with a smile by the staff, who catered to both French and English speaking customers with enthusiasm. They seemed to have yummy muffins and cookies but I wasn't hungry, so didn't get to try them. The space is pretty cool, with a high table and a world map hanging on the wall right behind. Lots of wood, with an industrial feel to the place. Crowd was kinda hip and good looking, but not pretentious. All in all, good value for your money - they make a good almond milk latté and it's also a nice place to sit down and relax, right off the Main."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying out Kitsune because a friend recommended it to me as being the most amazing place to get a latte in Montreal. I stopped in and my friend and I ordered two almond milk iced lattes. Mine was made perfectly, and my friend got what looked to be milk and ice cubes. It seemed as though I got all of the espresso and she didn't get any. When asking about it (we ordered the same thing and they looked very different) he said they were the same. The lattes were $4 each and we ended up throwing my friends out and sharing mine. I'm giving the 3 stars for inconsistency in their product. However the guy working was so sweet we didn't want to make him upset so if it wasn't for him and the awesome atmosphere of Kitsune I would have given this place 1 star (which rarely happens with me)!"}
{"text":"Over the summer of 2016, this coffee shop changed owners therefore it is called Cafe Nocturne instead of Kitsune. Everything in the shop is the same except the sign on the wall that used to say Kitsune. There are lights that hang over the cashier now. A few things have been added to the menu like juices. I also believe they changed the beans that they use. They now offer Dispatch beans and you can buy the beans in bags. The name has changed, but everything is pretty much the same.

TRY THEIR CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE! It is so delicious. It is very chewy and moist!"}
{"text":"to catch up with my friend. after entering we realized that this café is too tiny for 2 girls to talk (girls often sound loud, right?)... but there were others having conversation so anyway we stayed there, which was right decision.

coffee tastes bitter gooood. one of my favourite in mtl actually. interior decoration was so cool and fashionable. i was just wondering why their name is in japanese...its cute though.

i will come back for their gibraltar and huge cookie, but try to stay more calm maybe."}
{"text":"Kitsuné has a very \"hip\" atmosphere. They have a huge table and stools for sitting which allows you to share the table with others so you end up talking to new people. There's a huge signage in the bag which looks great. Haven't been in the backyard because I never visited during the summer. The ambience is definitely a 5-star.

As for the coffee, I enjoyed my latte but it wasn't something that truly stood out. Therefore, giving it a 3-star."}
{"text":"Une bonne ambiance, un staff très nice, du bon café et en plus c'est vélo-friendly ! Que demander de plus ?"}
{"text":"Great little shop. Funky and industrial. Very good coffee. Not the best in town but not far off.  They have decent seating areas and wifi also."}
{"text":"Very hip spot, but despite that the staff is still kind and won't condscend you!  VERY stylish cafe, with excellent drinks.  I didn't try any of the snacks, but it looked like they had some pretty tasty cookies out for the customers.  I will say that it can be very quiet in there with everyone sitting at the table in the middle clicking away at laptops with heaphones on, and you will get some dirty looks from the patrons when you walk in if you're not \"one of them\".  

Very cool spot, worth checking out if you're a coffee/espresso lover!"}
{"text":"Stunningly good coffee, by people who really care. It's hard to to think of anywhere with better coffee or better ambience. 

Tried this place several times and every time was a winner."}
{"text":"Beautifully designed space with a cool communal table. The soy latte I got was just right, and served in a small glass. The cookies looked delicious."}
{"text":"1) Great coffee for the price
2) Very, very nice spot (as in, how can they afford this, serving $2 coffee?)
3) Cafe attendant was an asshole (2cool4u-cuz-i-work-at-a-cafe-with-bikes-vibes)"}
{"text":"Great little place on Prince Arthur, not too far from the Main. I love the decor - lots of wood with a minimalist feel but a great vibe. The coffee's great and they have a good selection of baked goods - my recommendation? The brownie. YUMMMMMMMMM!

The price list is pretty good - you'll pay less for a latte here than you will at a Starbucks or Second Cup. A Chai latte + decadent brownie will set you back a whole $7. Not bad considering the brownie was huge. 

Service was nice. Will go back. Check it!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a warm cup of coffee. 

Have a chat with your barista, it's the easy way to get the best experience.

I love the cute printed out cups.

The washroom was tiny but squeaky clean."}
{"text":"After seeing Yelp pictures of the cute cat stamps on the to go coffee cups, I thought that I'd have to check this place out.

If you love coffee and often in the downtown area, then you'd want to check this place out.

Ordered the Gibraltar and it was very good.  My friend ordered the chai latté and I think she liked it too.  Would have loved to order the cookies or muffins to eat but didn't feel like the ideal place to sit and chat here.  The front part of the shop has a long table but it was full of people with their laptops. It seems like a definite quiet place to study.

We sat on the back terrace and it was quiet as well, but it was hard to have a conversation.  We preferred to face each other but how the seating is arranged, you are sitting next to each other.

And yup, seems hipster in here.  Seeing the bike dock IN the store was cool too."}
{"text":"coffee is great, hits the spot for the Cali girl in Montreal winter here!!  sweet they have an indoor bike rack for winter."}
{"text":"The wooden accents makes this cafe a great afternoon relaxing spot. I usually not a chai latte person, but the one they made here was not too shabby. I wish they had more seats though and more electrical outlets. That would make this a great study spot. 

If you browse around the back of the cafe, you'll find a hipster little corner with typewriters and books. Be sure to try their bake goods though!"}
{"text":"Had a show across the way at Petit campus and my friend suggested going to this place. So cute! Limited seating but they do fresh pressed juices as well. I had a latte and it was quite delightful. Loved the subway tile and vibe of this place. Kinda tucked away, just slightly off the main street with only a little coffee mug to mark it's spot. 

Didn't get to try any of their baked goods that people have mentioned but I would definitely come back, their coffee was the perfect pick me up."}
{"text":"Cool spot... too bad the owners and patronage know it. Maybe I chose a bad day and time but this place came off as a bit pretentious. good coffee though."}
{"text":"Super beau petit (tout petit) café. La décoration est bien sympathique, des grandes tables pour travailler, discuter, passer du bon temps. Pour ma part j'étais au bar contre les fenêtres, avec le soleil du matin et un livre... on ne peut rêver plus parfaite matinée !
Avec en plus de ça un bon cappuccino (un cappuccino parfait, la parfaite balance entre le café et le lait), et un bon petit bagel au cream cheese.
Oui vraiment, si un Samedi matin vous n'avez envie de rien d'autre que d'un livre, un cappuccino et un rayon de soleil, c'est là qu'il faut aller les chercher :)"}
{"text":"An adorable little place in this cute part of town, it's decidedly casual with a large communal table and a few other areas for seating. It has a rustic charm. 

I got a coffee, which was brewed perfectly as well as a chocolate chip cookie. They actually had multiple types. They also had an assortment of muffins that were delicious. Great service and free wifi."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, great vibes. I always order latte, though I order tea sometimes. Too bad Kitsune doesn't offer a wide range of tea.
Downside: It is usually hard to find a seat, many people bring their laptop to study there.
However, great ambiance."}
{"text":"Kitsuné is a solid little coffee shop that will definitely serve your need for a good brew, no question. In addition, its cozy and quiet vibe serves as a great place to get work done, so McGill students living close to or in the Plateau should consider making this one of their \"café-hopping\" spots if they're sick of the library and need to get out of the house more often!

I ordered the mocha and chocolate chip cookie, and while the mocha in particular wasn't anything that special, the first bite into my cookie cemented in my mind that without a doubt, Kitsuné knows how to make a good cookie. The edges are perfectly crisp, but the softness and of the center combined with the light sweetness of the chocolate chips made that three extra dollars so worth spending. I may or may not have tried to dip it into the mocha a few times to add an extra dimension of coffee flavor into it... Which, by the way, was also pretty divine.

Kitsuné is one of the many reasons why I still maintain that the Plateau is the best area for food and coffee in the entire 514. If you need an introduction to places with good food AND aesthetics, then this should be one of your first stops. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Première visite au Kitsuné pour moi hier après-midi. 
J'avais beaucoup d'attentes et je n'ai pas été déçue! Les grandes lettres illuminées au fond puis l'immense table en bois au centre du café ont rapidement attiré mon attention. Il y a aussi une petite terrasse (sans tables pour l'instant) à l'arrière. Je m'y suis installée pour travailler un peu, un excellent (vraiment excellent!!) espresso. Il y a une bonne variété de viennoiseries, auxquelles je n'ai pas goûté. La musique était un peu forte et intense au début, mais tout est rapidement rentré dans l'ordre. Très satisfaite de mon expérience!!"}
{"text":"Kitsune is a small little coffee shop that located off of Prince Arthur.  They have coffee and tea beverages, as well as a small selection of pastries.  I tried their Chai Tea Latte, and it was served in a small glass cup.  It was creamy, not too sweet, and had a nice amount of foam, sprinkled with some cinnamon on top.  Service was super friendly, and there are communal high-tops to enjoy your beverages, do some work, or do some studying.  

+chai tea latte
+friendly staff
+free wi-fi"}
{"text":"Un espresso bar sobre, grandes tables en bois communes, ambiance pause travail détendue, accueil très sympa, musique agréable et café délicieux.

En revanche, quand j'y suis allée, le choix de pâtisseries était très réduit (croissants et bagels) et il n'avaient pas de laits végétaux (contrairement à ce que j'ai vu sur une photo)"}
{"text":"Hey Kitsune, firstly totally appreciate the awesome typography sign. Coooool. Also, cute Batista twin haircuts. Now that that's out of the way - solid coffee. Seemed like a library since just about everyone was on a laptop. Good magazine selection to read with your cuppa coffee. Wouldn't go out of my way for it but a goodie in the area."}
{"text":"Little hidden gem.

This little cafe is a real delight. 

Food/drink : The coffee is delicious and so was the tea. The pastries and cookies were also great. Everything is simple, but in this case simple is best!

Service: the girl at the counter is very nice! Be a little patient, she's alone doing everything, so kudos.

Ambience : very laid back, nice eclectic decor (blend of retro, rustic, zen). Don't neglect the little terrace in the back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. One of the tastiest Americanos I've ever had. So rich! Not sure what they're doing right. Free wifi and a fair bit of workspace. They just need more comfortable seats."}
{"text":"High quality espresso drinks, nice decor and interior bike parking. Staff are always friendly. Not a ton of seating during the school year as it gets packed with McGill students pretending to study."}
{"text":"What a wonderful cafe.

Everything you need: great espresso, minimal decor, quiet atmosphere, good wi-fi.. I could go on and on.

Highly recommended as your new go-to for coffee in the  lower Plateau."}
{"text":"l'ambiance de la place est très calme et agréable pour lire ou travailler, le café est bien exécuté et la terrasse est agréable pour relaxer. Le staff est toujours bien sympathique et c'est l'endroit parfait pour prendre une pause lorsqu'on traîne sur st-laurent."}
{"text":"BEST SPOT TO STUDY! I always come here to study during the day. It's pretty quiet and a small, cosy place. I love their decoration and the employees there are very friendly. It's a good spot during the day, as it closes early at night. I sometimes just wish Kitsune was bigger, but at the same time what makes it Kitsune is that its a small cosy coffee place."}
{"text":"Very cute space with delicious espresso drinks. Super nice service in French or English!"}
{"text":"I went this place not too long after they opened. It's border-line pretentious, but they have very good coffee to back up the attitude, so I'll let it slide.

They have wifi, but only tall tables/stools. They're still good to do some work from, but I usually find those tables a bit of a hassle when it's really busy."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop. We enjoyed a few coffee's and a croissant while listening to some hip music early friday morning."}
{"text":"We ordered our iced americanos and saw that several people before us had gotten their drinks, and about 10 minutes went by and we didn't get our drinks. We had to ask the barista and he forgot about our drinks. Besides that, the interior is nice and the coffee was alright. Hopefully the baristas don't have a habit of forgetting people's drinks!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cozy, coffee is great, service is friendly. If you haven't been here it's a must try."}
{"text":"You'll get some of the best espresso in Montreal here. It's small, so not a great place to set up shop to do work or relax for ages, but great to grab a quick macchiato. After sampling the coffee at all of the (allegedly) best places in Montreal, it's clear that Kitsuné serves the best cup."}
{"text":"I'm always a sucker for really cute, swanky, and semi-hipster cafes...and Kitsune definitely fits the bill! :) 

We were wandering around Montreal and stopped by Kitsune for a quick pick-me-up. We had espressos and it was very delightful! Beautiful balance of a nice dark and bitter roast. Beautiful. 

They have a few selections of pastries available as well. The decor is very homey--with \"Kitsune\" spelt out in lights on the back wall and rustic/vintage, high swiveling wooden chairs."}
{"text":"This was the best soy latte I have ever had on the entire east coast. They don't make iced coffee (although they can make an iced americano) but who cares. They use barista series soy milk and it's one of the few times I've gotten latte art with soy.

Atmosphere is cozy, lots of people with laptops out, all sitting along one long communal table. Also, for american tourists: they accept credit card, unlike Pikolo down the street."}
{"text":"Café sympa sur Prince-Arthur ! Ouvert depuis Juin 2013, sur Prince-Arthur à l'ouest de St-Laurent, ce petit café est vite devenu une référence dans le coin pour boire un bon café. Ils utilisent des grains de café ''Anchored Coffee'' de Nouvelle-Écosse. Café filtre 2$ /// expresso 2,50$ /// Latté 4$ /// Pâtisserie 3$. Prix abordables, déco tendance moderne/rustique, personnel gentil, petite terrasse à l'arrière l'été, wifi gratuit, ce café est vite devenu très populaire dans le quartier, beaucoup de gens d'ailleurs y travaillent sur les tables centrales durant la journée, assez calme comme ambiance donc. Venez y plutôt pour lire ou travailler mais pour discuter de vive voix avec un ami / une amie, je choisirai un autre café. D'ailleurs, généralement, je demande mon café/expresso pour emporter, car ce café est toujours remplit à pleine capacité. Qu'importe, je viens ici pour la qualité du café. *carte de crédits acceptées.

5/5 visité en juillet 2015"}
{"text":"Awesome spot to get some work done and enjoy a good espresso. One of my favorite cafés in the city."}
{"text":"Tous mes amis savent que j'adore le café alors ils peuvent me trouver dans des endroits comme celui-ci à presque tous les jours. Je suis allée au Kitsuné à quelques reprises et à chaque fois, les cafés étaient très bon. J'aime particulièrement leurs allongés avec une touche de lait (chauffé en plus!) qui est bien balancé sans un arrière goût amer. Pour les pâtisseries, ça dépend de l'heure et de la journée. Un lundi matin, ils n'avaient même pas de toasts, mais en plein jeudi après-midi, j'y ai vu des scones salés de Sweet Lee's. Le service est correct et l'ambiance pas mal relaxe. J'adore les grandes lettres illuminées sur le mur arrière. Elles ajoutent un élément de déco spécial et me permettent de trouver le café même si mes yeux sont tous petits trop de bonne heure le matin."}
{"text":"La première fois que j'y suis allée, j'ai trouvé le service tellement désagréable que j'ai évalué un peu \"sévèrement\" ce coffee shop. Peut-être que le barista passait simplement une mauvaise journée? Dans tous les cas, quand on travaille auprès du public, on devrait savoir mieux contrôler ses humeurs...

Bref, ça m'a pris près d'un an avant de donner une seconde chance au Kitsuné, mais j'ai bien fait d'y retourner. D'autant plus que je passe devant à tous les jours, donc ça devenait de plus en plus difficile de résister! Mon allongé était délicieux, les prix me semblent raisonnables et le service a été vraiment courtois cette fois-ci. J'aime beaucoup la tranquillité de l'endroit. On peut s'y installer confortablement pour travailler. Il y a plusieurs prises électriques à disposition. Coup de coeur aussi pour la petite terrasse à l'arrière, et le rack à vélo (je me déplace principalement à pied, mais j'avoue que c'est un détail vraiment pratique pour ceux qui vont à vélo!) J'y retournerai assurément, à partir de maintenant :-)"}
{"text":"Il ne s'agit pas de la même enseigne qu'à Paris. François Beauregard, désigner de mode, déjà propriétaire de 2 boutiques à Montréal, a récemment ouvert ce café, très new yorkais dans le style. On y sert du très bon café, ainsi que d'autres boissons chaudes, dont un délicieux chai latte. On peut aussi y déguster des scones, cookies et autres pâtisseries anglo-saxonnes. Sa particularité: la présence d'un parking vélo à l'intérieur du café, comme ça votre 2 roues est en sécurité!"}
{"text":"This place is ok, the ambience is nice and it's a good location but it can get crowded. They have a terrace but it's really small and can fit maybe 3 groups of people max. I also ordered an iced americano which the barista forgot about. People in front of me were all getting their drinks and eventually I had to go and ask about it. There was only one barista working but it wasn't very busy, hopefully it's just a one time thing!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, superb ambiance, extremely friendly stuff. What else do you expect from a cafe?! Definitely my new fav place. Why?

Not as crowded and smelly as Neve.
Myriade doesn't have wifi. Kitsune does.
Humble Lion's sour (edit: not anymore) espresso? 
Arts Cafe (on Fairmount) is little too far. (edit: plus have rude service)"}
{"text":"They definitely have THE BEST chai tea latte, it's very very rich with the perfect amount of spice!! omg!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My eyes opened so wide after the first sip like \"What? We have a puppy for Christmas?\" kind of surprise. 

Their baked goods sit on the counter all day, but are delicious. A cookie is $3 (tax included). 

Fantastic service!! The music is odd. Sometimes extremely quiet, sometimes loud. Since we were the only people talking, I felt SO BAD when the piano music is dramatic and quiet. It's like I'm giving an inspirational tear-jerking speech. Which leads me to conclude that this is a superb study spot! It is so quiet in the mornings, plenty of outlets all around the cafe.

Friendly staff!"}
