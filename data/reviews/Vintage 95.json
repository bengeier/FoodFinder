{"text":"Had a very enjoyable time at Vintage95 last Saturday night. The wait staff was top notch and very accommodating. Very comfortable atmosphere and furnishings. The young woman paying guitar was excellent ... wonderful renditions of a Roberta Flack and Cranberries tunes, among others. Looking forward to going back and sampling the single malts they have. 5 Stars for my date too!"}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate Valentine's Day and what a great choice! We were seated outside in comfy chairs with a fire pit in front of us for for ambiance.    We had some wine and bruschetta followed by a phenomenal dinner.  We ordered the sea bass and a burger and took turns eating them both. My wife who doesn't even like fish really enjoyed my sea bass. It was delicious! Her burger was amazing too!  Made from Grilled Shortrib and Angus Chuck Patty with Tenderbelly Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, Crispy Onion Straws and Cheddar Cheese.  Yum!!  Our server was attentive without being in the way and allowed us to relax and enjoy our evening, never making us feel rushed or neglected."}
{"text":"Went to this place before having dinner elsewhere.  I ordered the warm Brie appetizer and it was fantastic.  Next time I will stay and order from the dinner menu.  The staff are nice and the decor is pleasant.  I will return."}
{"text":"I recently held my friend's Bridal Shower here and it was amazing!  All the staff (management/servers) and Erica my Event Coordinator there were the best!  They were so accommodating with all my requests and went above and beyond in customer service. The food was delicious and the atmosphere provided the perfect venue for my friend's Bridal Shower.  I would strongly recommend making a visit to Vintage 95!"}
{"text":"Giving these guys five stars because I can't think of anything that would have made our experience any better.  We sat on the patio in the back which is right against a parking lot but we quickly forgot that. The atmosphere was relaxed and rustic. Our sever John had the perfect balance of attentiveness without our party feeling rushed or bothered. The Bruschetta is the star and a must try! Be brave and try them all. We also had the watermelon salad and tomato bisque followed by the duck and short ribs. Everything on the menu was a taste adventure. I will be back for sure. It was a delightful experience."}
{"text":"At a glance this place look really cool and the menu sounds great. I had ordered a to-go a duck entree and a mixed protein burger.. The duck was to bland and the sauce was to hard to glaze or dip I could turn the cup upside down and it would not spill.. You would probably have to wait five minutes for it to get on the floor and as for my burger it was over cooked and dry.. It was a pork and beef patty, sounds awesome! Right? Well not here but made well I am sure could be magnificent.. This place it more of a tapas and wine not dinner.. Even thin it was to-go I live directly infront this restaurant so no time was wasted in eating a fresh dish."}
{"text":"Great great great ambiance! But the food?....meh ...so disappointed with the happy hour food"}
{"text":"I decided to check out Vintage 95 after reading reviews on Yelp and am so happy we checked it out.  My boyfriend and I arrived around 8 and there was an hour wait. We luckily found seats at the bar and ordered the bruschetta and a few glasses of  wine until our table was ready. The bruschetta in my opinion is not as good as Postinos, but was still very tasty.  I was not that hungry after the bruschetta so I just had the tomato bisque and the ricotta salad. Both were delicious. My boyfriend had the Tenderloin and was also great. The patio is great and had a fun vibe. Service was wonderful. I will defiantly be back and have been telling my friends."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with the family.  We got the flatbread pizza, shrimp poboy and the burger.  Everything was great but our favorite was the burger and fries...WOW!!!!  Probably one of the best burgers we've ever had.  Environment was upscale (I don't dress trendy enough to fit in there, haha) and staff were friendly and responsive.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"We went there with a large group of about 30 people. I know that can be a challenge, but nevertheless, it does not warrant the wait staff to be rude. They were flat out rude to all of us. It was a clear they did not want us there, despite making a reservation. Overall, it is a nice place but not nice enough to overcome the staff."}
{"text":"I went there a few weeks ago with a buddy of mine and it was fairly busy, great drink selection,friendly staff, and decent appetizer selection. We got one with Brie,hummus, flatbread with zucchini, I can't remember the name, but it wasn't too bad. We also got I believe it was called rockin shrimp? And I was surprised how much shrimp actually came with it, and it was pretty good!"}
{"text":"I have been to Vintage 95 several times for lunch, with coworkers etc. The food has always been amazing so this year, when I was in charge of planning a company night out, I really wanted to take everyone to Vintage 95. I was referred to Erica @ Vintage to get everything planned. She was great and explained everything very thoroughly to me and made me feel confident that the night would be perfect. We arrived (last night) and our area on the patio was fantastic. Our every need was catered to by Emily, Ari, and John during our dinner. All of my employees loved their food and drinks; we had a great night and would (and have) recommend Vintage to other companies as well as family and friends!"}
{"text":"Vintage 95 has defined itself as a standout. There are many wine bars out there, but this place feels more warm and inviting than most. With a comfortable and relaxed vibe (and lovely live music). The staff go out of their way to make you feel at home. The wine selection is unique and personal (by-the-glass options frequently change) with a wide spread on price points. The food is beyond high-caliber with excellent plating and great seasonal rotations of a variety of proteins and greens. The menu is diverse enough to please any mood. Mike Wahlberg, the master chef behind the fun din, is a culinary gem. Kudos."}
{"text":"We have been there before and things have gone down hill.  Portions were small and \"happy hour\" wine selections not stellar.    While server was attentive at first, once we had paid bill - there were no longer visits to table for water or coffee refills.  No attempt at small talk or personalized service.    Restaurant was not busy.  No one rude but no one gave great service either."}
{"text":"I've have only ate here once but enjoyed everything our first visit. We bacon bloody Mary's that where incredible awesome. We had watermelon salad that was some of the best salad I have ever had with there Pepper corn vinegar at dressing. The atmosphere was awesome the service was great everybody was nice chairs were comfortable. It was a great place all around and I have zero complaints. We will be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great- outdoor seating with fire pit is great. This is a pricey place, and for what they charge you would expect really upscale food, I ordered the braised lamb pasta, which was ok. Lamb was tender and sauce was alright, but chunks of pasta was stuck together.  They offered to remake for me, but why bother. I see people just come in for a drink or appetizer for the ambiance. Maybe that is what it good for."}
{"text":"Amazing!!  My family was in town while attending some spring training games. A friend of ours suggested Vinatge 95 and we are thrilled to say we fell in love with the place. Outstanding decor invites you to your dinning table or casual dinning at one of their couches or fire-pits. The three of us sat at a table next to the wine room and we started off with a flatbread which was a great way to start off our meal. They have an extensive wine list and we all had a glass of what our personal preferences was that night. Axel was our server and not only was he attentive to our needs but he was extremely personable. We all dabbed in each others entrees and had nothing bad to say about any of them. Personal favorite was the burger, cooked to perfection! We closed the place down as we talked to the Sommelier and GM. Thanks to everyone at Vintage 95- we will be back again next year!"}
{"text":"This is a place I visit every time I'm in Chandler. What a great location, especially at Christmastime with all the downtown holiday lights, and the inside of V95 is always warm and inviting. We started with a server who knew about the wine list, which was helpful in selecting ones that went well with our appetizers. We enjoyed a tasty flatbread - I would have liked it crisper but the tomato sauce and sausage were excellent (homemade sausage I think). The brie platter was good but not too exciting. Wish we would have tried a meat/cheese platter...next time. At any rate, super service and a lovely after -dinner hangout with live music!"}
{"text":"This place is the best for happy hour! The restaurant itself is fairly dark, with heavy wood furniture and dim lighting, but the back patio more than makes up for it. Comfortable chairs and groupings with misters in the summer and heaters and fire pits in the winter, it's like hanging out in someone's posh backyard. While the food and drinks are on the pricey side, you won't find better appetizers or mixed cocktails anywhere in Downtown Chandler, the chefs and bartenders are masters at their craft!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but the food didn't quite measure up.  Great live music and Wednesday wine specials were good.  Rock shrimp was tasty but cold.  Flatbread was tough and toppings a bit bland.  Chocolate brownie good but apple crisp fell flat.  Will try another eatery next time in the area."}
{"text":"We have been in for lunch many times working in Downtown Chandler and it has always been very good.  Decided to try it for dinner with my husband.  Food was absolutely amazing.   Hubby had the tenderloin and I had the Rib-eye.  Both were done to perfection and the sides were wonderful as well.  Portion sizes were generous without being massive. We both had a glass of wine and the wine list is pretty good if a bit pricey.  The ambiance and decor are outstanding.  The only reason I did not give it five stars was the fact that the waiter who has served me at least 10 times for lunch didn't even begin to recognize me and asked if we had ever been there before, he was also a little on the slow side for refills. There was no bread either which we thought odd."}
{"text":"A group of us had dinner on the back patio on a quiet Wednesday night.  It certainly is large and pretty with the two big fire pits but you can't be satisfied with ambiance alone, especially when you're hungry.  To start with our table shared the baked brie and a variety of the bruschettas   The brie was nice (I liked the presentation of grilled squash with it) and the bruschettas were also pretty tasty except for the pistachio date one.  That was horribly sweet and kind of gross.  After the appetizers the meal kind of went downhill.  The tomato bisque was too smoky in flavor and was left untouched by most of us.  The kale salad I ordered was tough and inedible and the flatbread I got as a replacement was tasteless and bland. I did like my rose and our server was very patient and pleasant.  But with such subpar food, good wine in a nice setting wasn't enough. The table next to us had the right idea, they ate elsewhere and came here for a nightcap."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Downtown Chandler, hands down! Awesome staff and great setting."}
{"text":"A few stops in here so far and we're well on our way to becoming regulars. Vintage 95 in the Old Town Chandler area, replaces what was an embarrassingly bad short lived asian restaurant. The location is gorgeous, great back patio, a small front one too if you want to do some people watching, or just want to watch the turnover of restaurants in the strip, which happens so often that yes, you may actually be able to see them close and open within the span of your meal / bottle of wine. The service has always been friendly here, and though we usually come during \"off\" hours, it always seems fairly quiet for lunch. The food menu is not incredibly diverse and sort of falls into wine bar modus operendi, i.e. assorted bruschetta, sandwiches, etc, but for the most part is well appointed and tasty. One star taken away because the food hasn't always been mind blowing. So pick and choose carefully, and you should be fine...lets just say that if the item isn't normally in your wheelhouse, don't order it. If its the kind of thing you'd usually be ordering anyways, the familiarity will get you by. (The Green Chile Pulled Pork is quite tasty...but those words in that combination is going to get me every time) The wine list is great, the specialty cocktails are fun, the ambiance is a succesful combination of warmth and cool, and the service staff always pretty like-able. The business is still pretty young, but Chandler, we really need to be helping the good ones out. This is a good one, they've got a good thing going here. so lets keep them around."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Colorado and California and picked this restaurant based on its reviews and posted menu.  It was an excellent choice.  Beautiful patio and although it was very busy, we could hear well enough to have a very nice conversation with the couple we were with. Our waiter was terrific..very attentive and helpful in choosing our meal. The food was wonderful and beautifully served. My husband had the ahi tuna and a Caesar salad and said the tuna was the best he's ever tasted.  The three others had pear salad which was so good, and then had the duck breast as our entree.  It was also excellent!  Our only complaint is the mark-up of wine.  The selection is wonderful (we even own some of it so we know the purchase price) but most choices were marked up at least by three.  We've experienced this at other restaurants in the Phoenix area as well so it must be typical.  Just seems as though more would take advantage of an excellent wine list if prices were more reasonable. Saw many folks ordering wine by the glass.  All in all, we enjoyed the evening very much and will certainly return."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positives- service was excellent! Our server, Maxwell, was great.  Negatives-mediocre food priced extremely high. The bruschetta board is $14 for 4 different choices.  The pistachio date bruschetta was way too sweet with nothing to balance out the flavors. There was a hint of cheese spread across the toasted bread which was so slight that it couldn't be detected. The bruschetta with the tomatoes and basil oil was supposed to come with house made ricotta. Again, the amount of ricotta on the bread didn't amount to anything. If it's so special, then give it to me and let me taste it! The salami and olive bruschetta combined two salty foods, thus making it extra salty! Did not seem well thought out. Tomato bisque was ok, but there were only 6 tiny croutons that when combined could have fit into a tablespoon. The menu description sounded like you might get some sort of grilled cheese croutons. Not even close. We also tried the kale salad with salmon which was good, however the portion size could have been bigger considering the price. Again, way over priced. I would not recommend this place unless you like throwing your money away."}
{"text":"Rating is based on 2 visits.   Our first visit a few weeks ago was awesome. Great waiter (friendly & clearly communicated) and 1/2 price wine bottles on Sunday = awesome. Tonight, well... if it weren't for the company... A friend and I met for happy hour, arriving at 4. I guess I could have looked at menu more closely after a long day and challenged our waiter's suggestion, but I trusted our waiter to steer me to a good wine at a good price. It was HH! This was not a good decision - based totally on previous visit. He mentioned 2 Sauvignon Blancs - one from France that he didn't recommend. I took his recommendation. I learned neither was the HH wine (found out later the HH SB was from Chile). He didn't mention this. So when the bill came...shock. At almost $100 before tip, that's when we learned we didn't get happy hour deals. Our check showed $10 and $15 per glass - which we felt was expensive for Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc plus 1 appetizer - a combo meat and cheese board that was not all that - during HH. We joked that we should have met at Flemings. We'd eat & drink better for the same price. But we wanted to support a Downtown Chandler business. When my friend returned for her keys (after dessert elsewhere), that's when we asked the hostess to check happy hour menu. Guess we were had. Never again. I'm wiser now. If you go for happy hour, make sure your waiter doesn't lure you to spend more. Smart business to up sell? Not if you want return customers."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly. Ahi tuna was excellent, not prepared the traditional way but excellent just the same. The garlic frys were the best french fries I'd ever had!"}
{"text":"sat at the bar with my MacGyver, split a chocolate dessert and bottle of wine, listened the the live music...lovely."}
{"text":"They have chosen their eclectic wine menu very selectively. And their food pairings are very appropriate and tasty. But my honest feeling is that their pricing points are 30%-40% higher than they should be. They do try make good with it with the quality of their staff (especially Richard at the bar). But if you go in as a couple (even during happy hour) and have a couple glasses of wine each, share an appetizer and each get an entree, you'll easily be over $100 with tip. Good stuff, but not that good."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  The crowd is lively with a good mix of people from twenty something and older singles out to eat and drink along with couples through their 70s to go with business people out for lunch, dinner or just drinks after work. The good music and unique decor are nice touches as it seems the owners have worked hard to build a fun yet classy atmosphere.  The menu is excellent (lunch and dinner) with strong wine and beer selections (including many local ones). The meat and cheese board and the various bruschetta selections are excellent for starters.  The flatbread selections are also very good.   The entrees are excellent with a variety of tasty selections but I favor the simple ones -- the chicken pannini and cheeseburger. That cheeseburger is ridiculously good.   The service has been good each time but getting better as the staff seems to be settling in. The owners stopped by the table on our latest visit and seem to be taking a great interest in their establishment. Well done -- we will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Yes!  This place is going to hit the radars in all the local mag asap!  Watch out.    HH consist of a good selection of $5 wines of all varietals or $20 bottles.  Choose to pay for a full price bottle and you will get yourself a free meat board.  A Great appetizer.  Soups and Salads are all great and have their own little unique flairs.  $3 for a cup of soup, $9 to $12 for salads.  We ate the Pork Belly Appetizer which was on top o a corn grit and collards. The Pork Belly was over an inch thick! So fatty, soo delicious.  Main courses are very unique and you can tell that the chef takes pride in his work.    The Owners are actively part of the evening and chat with customers.  In the evenings they have a soloist singer/guitarist play and it compliments the atmosphere nicely.  A pricey night for us but we did not hold back any stops. Vintage could be done with as much money as you wish.  Visit! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very unique place Wow has downtown chandler changed, Bruschetta is to die for and the smores desert is great also wonderful wine selection as expected but FYI they have a nice selection of unique beers also"}
{"text":"Made a dinner reservation on 2/13, for 7:30pm on 2/14, Valentine's Day. Called by the restaurant at 3:30 on 2/14, told there was a system problem and offered a table at 8:30, which was declined by me. They should have called sooner to cancel. Still showing open reservations at 7:30 on Open Table. Won't be going there, ever!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I can't believe I'm giving 5 stars to a place in Chandler, Arizona!  I'm from NYC and I need to maintain my snob status....but we had such a fabulous time, I can't help it!!  Setting - I totally forgot we were in a parking lot!  The 5 of us were hanging out in the back, sitting around a fire on cozy couches, enjoying a perfect April evening.    Server - very nice, even helpful when my 4 year old daughter spilled wine all over the place!  Did not feel rushed in the least in a good, relaxed way.    Food - we had the scallops, fish, olives, meats and cheese platter, 3 kinds of bruschetta - all was wonderful, tasty, well prepared and artistically arranged on each plate.   I was really surprised how the fish just melted in my mouth, great job!    Wine - pretty good wine selection and a good price by the bottle and glass.   Thanks for a great Arizona night out!  It was better than all the subsequent nights that we had out in uppity Scottsdale later in the week!"}
{"text":"First of all, credit where credit is due, the food was fantastic and they have a very good patio that was great for a nice Saturday night dinner.  Service, however, was somewhat shocking for a restaurant of this caliber.  My husband and I have been searching for restaurants in Chandler with good food and unpretentious service.  They scored big on the first count but failed miserably on the second.  We dropped in at about 4:45 on a Saturday for dinner.  We asked to sit outside.  The host said that was fine, the patio was empty but we would need to leave by 7:00 when he had reservations.  That's a bit odd to hear that we have to get out by a certain time, but we never take more than 2 hours to eat so no big deal.  We sit down outside and order drinks and an appetizer and eventually dinner.  Our waiter was ok, but not terribly attentive or friendly.  Again, not a big deal but somewhat off-putting.   I had the salmon (excellent!) and my husband has the burger which was also very good.  We finish by about 5:45 and ask to see a desert menu.   We are looking over the menu when the host shows up at our table and tells us we have to leave our table.  His 7:00 reservation for our table was there an hour early and he was kicking us out of our table.  \"Luckily,\" though, he had a table inside we could squat at so that we could order desert and close out our tab.    He said he was sorry but he had to make these other people happy.  If we had just ordered a single round of drinks and mulled over them for an hour we might have understood, but we ordered several drinks, an appetizer, two entrees and were contemplating desert when he tried to kick us out of our table for a reservation that was a full hour early.  Had he told us we only had until 5:45 to eat and get out from the get go, we might have understood, but he told us 7:00.    We told him to close out our tab and we would get the hell out of there like he clearly wanted.  He came back and said that we could stay out our table the reservation \"luckily\" wanted a different one.....no thanks!!!   He ended up buying us a round of drinks but, honestly, by that time we were pretty irritated.  I get it.  We didn't have reservations on a Saturday night.  We were walk-ins and didn't expect to be treated like we had reservations.  Had they told us that meant we would need to be done by 6:00, I would have understood completely.  I felt, however, that they thought it was awesome to be there when they were completely dead, but once \"better\" people showed up, we needed to pay up and get the hell out.   Fairly sure this was our first and last visit.  Really a shame, as the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Never again will I allow this place to ruin my dining experience. There are so many more places to spend my dining dollars. This year, for Valentines Day (actually on Sat the 13th), I made reservations (in January) for dinner with my wife and when we arrive, they want to seat us at a \"table\" that is actually a trunk that sits lower that the actual seats that surround it, one of which is sofa type seat. When I ask for an actual table I am told that the only \"available\" seat would be outside. Mind you, I specifically requested an indoor table when I made my reservations. It was just about 6 PM, and although the rear patio was pretty full, inside the restaurant there were literally 10 to 12 empty tables, including two right next to the \"table\" we were directed to. When I pointed that out, one of their condescending staff members proceeded to remind me that it was Valentines Day, like I was some kind of moron who didnt realize that. They also told me that if I wanted a \"real table\" then I would just have to wait...wait for what? One of those empty tables to be available?   Basically I felt as though we were only good enough to be seated at a trunk, but not an actual table. Apparently they save those for someone who's reservation is more important. That silly trunk table was suitable for sitting down to have some drinks and maybe a few appetizers, not for a couple trying to enjoy a Valentines Day dinner.  Who wants to try to eat dinner off a trunk no higher that the seat you are sitting in (maybe 20 inches high....) and no way to even put your feet under it?  Anyhow, this was my last visit to Vintage 95. This place needs stop trying to be the hippest spot in Chandler and start caring about their customers dining experience. From a previous visit ( I walked out this time) I can tell you that the food is actually pretty good, but they make is so difficult to enjoy it. Like I said above, Never Again."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere and very tasty food. We're here for Valentine's Day and the staff has been great. I had the duck and the hubby went with a burger. Both had great flavor but my one complaint, both were a little over salted. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went there with a bunch of people from work.  The food was fantastic (meat and cheese plates with nuts, all different types of bruschetta - yum!)  I love the seating with the big comfy couches.  The wine was $5 on Happy Hour (gotta love that.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I booked an 8pm dinner reservation for a bachelorette party of 10 this Saturday. Our party showed up 20 minutes early thinking we could get a drink at the bar or maybe, just maybe they would have our table ready. Our table was not ready so they sat us outside so we could enjoy a drink while we waited for our table. However, a storm was brewing outside and it started to rain. So they moved us to the front patio (this would have been a comfortable place if they had a misting system), it was a humid 111 degree day, so we were hit, thirsty and hungry by this point. Our server John came in to turn this unfortunate situation around, he got us drinks with assurance and a smile. We didn't sit at our table until 8:30 or so, but they provided customer service by giving us complimentary champagne. We were taken care of and satisfied."}
{"text":"I've been here enough times to know two things: the food is good and the service is borderline terrible.    I was here most recently with my boyfriend for a late lunch (3pm).  The problem?  Nobody ever came to offer us anything to eat.  The \"server\", who was clearly checked out and just waiting until 4pm until he could really \"check out\", gave us our order of drinks and then never, ever, ever returned.    My boyfriend and I are both in the service industry, we both understand there is a \"down time\" (from 2:30ish till 4:00ish) where it's quiet and the kitchen is switching to dinner service and there aren't many (if any) customers in the place.  That's all the MORE reason to pay extra attention to the people that ARE in your place.  In this case, it was just us.  Our server came, told us there were no apps available because the kitchen was changing over (no problem), took our drink orders, and then just ceased to exist until he could check out at 4.  Leaving us, two VERY hungry people, waiting at a table for an hour.  Honestly, it's this kind of experience that will turn someone off a place forever and that's while we will never go back to Vintage 95, despite what we know to be a good menu.    Go only if you've got loads of time to waste and when you're barely starting to get hungry.  If you go when you're hungry, it's already too late."}
{"text":"We have been here several times, for drinks and also for dinner. We love the atmosphere, and the setting is intimate. On the two occasions that we had dinner, we were very pleased with the food. The bruschetta is excellent, as was the summer salad w/chicken. My husband had the Vintage burger and devoured every bite!  I was disappointed that they do not offer other sandwiches on the dinner menu though, and do find their selection of wines by the glass very limited. For those reasons I am only awarding 3 stars."}
{"text":"Would have been a 1 star except the great ambiance, lively band and wait staff (which was a bit slow) but helpful & friendly. This was my 2nd visit with 4 or more business associates. Both times we ordered the charcuterie (V95 board) appetizer and both times that was awesome.    This visit (2/28/15) I chose the flatiron steak as an entree.  It was the worst steak I can recall ever being served, I asked for med rare / med and it was a severely undercooked, sinewy excuse for a $30+ dollar piece of meat.  I wasn't sure whether to ask for the steak to be sent back or for a sharper steak knife to cut it! I won't send meals back though, I just don't return to the establishment - a plate at that price should be done right the first time.    To top it off - all the next day I had very \"fluid\" reminders that I shouldn't have forced myself to eat 1/3 of that steak.   The wine and wine list were good & the duck the rest of my party had was as well. With tip the bill was  $200, which would have been fine had I been able to eat.    V95 as of yesterday does not off the flatiron (mis)steak on the menu, maybe they figured out its atrocious, I won't be back to confirm."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to tell you how overpriced the wine is here. Last night we had a bottle Chappellet wine with our meal at an upscale Scottsdale restaurant. We paid 65 for it. Tonight we ate in downtown Chandler and they wanted 130 for the same exact bottle. My husband and I have had many red wines while visiting places from Baltimore to California. Never have I seen a more overpriced bottle of wine. This place needs to get over itself! Where do you think you are New York?"}
{"text":"Congratulations on the best wine list award. We sat at the bar, and he (shame on me, writing this review 1 month after and forgot his name... Gabriel?) knows his stuff. He has passion, and it's contagious. Good food, even better wine and great service. What a pleasant experience. It was not our first time, and definitely not the last. This kind of local place can be proud of their establishment, and the well deserved awards they gain. They will see us again, and again."}
{"text":"Stopped by to check out this place and loved it.  Even though we visited a few months ago when it was very new, the service and food were excellent.  Wonderful outdoor area with lots of comfortable furniture.  I'll be back with more friends."}
{"text":"Meh... I went her a few days ago with my family for an early dinner. The food was so so. We waited nearly and hour and a half for our entrees after our appetizer. The kitchen didn't open until 5:00 and we got there just after 4pm. We had already been seated and ordered and app before our server told us the kitchen wasn't open until 5. We finally got our entrees around 5:45 and they were disappointing. We got the stink eye the entire time we were waiting because my mom ( who has blood sugar issues) asked the server for some bread while we were waiting. Her burger came out totally burnt to a crisp. It looked like a school cafeteria patty. Maybe intentionally after she asked for bread. The chef and a few other men were in the expediting area and were glaring at her while she ate. She wanted to complain but we had been there for so long already she just wanted to eat. My husband had the salmon,and my brother had the duck. They both thought the dishes were very tasty. I had a salad that was good but not worth the $26 in my opinion.   All in all the vibe was off, the staff looked miserable, our food was mediocre and over priced. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"We made our first trip to Vintage 95 this week and overall I was impressed.  The new owners have done an awesome job with the building and decor.  The interior has a nice wine cafe feel while the outdoor patio has an upscale hotel patio look complete with high end outdoor furniture and fire pits.  It's a great place to hang out and have dinner or a glass of wine this time of year.  Pros: The pulled pork and bruschetta that we had were amazing! The food was fresh, portions were nice and it all tasted amazing.  Whoever is running their kitchen definitely knows what they're doing.  Aside from the food, the building and decor were the second big selling point.  Cons: This restaurant really missed the mark with their staff.  The hostess was nice but struggled with where to put the six of us despite the fact that there weren't many people in that night (alone, not that big of a deal).  Our waiter was nice but couldn't tell us much about the menu items or specialties (they only have a one page menu at launch).  We were pleased to find wine from one of our favorite wineries, Arizona Stronghold, but really disappointed that the waiter couldn't tell our friends anything about the wine and completely butchered the location calling it Cochise Valley.  Sorry dude, it's Cochise County and that is a major flub against this AZ native.  Finally, it was great to see the owner come out and show off his new digs to his friends, but a word to the wise, we are the customers, you should make an effort to come over and welcome us and thank us for coming in.  It's repeat business from customers like us that will dictate your success in the future.  The reality is that the owner and staff form the personality of the establishment and ultimately that's what keeps people coming back (check the wait at an Anthony Canecchia or Joe Johnston restaurant to test that theory).  So, this place has a lot going for it and if the owner starts tending to his customers and can sharpen up his staff, they may have a recipe for success."}
{"text":"So my wife and I walked into Vintage 95 two weeks ago.  Looking for lunch and a spot for New Years Eve dinner.  Wow! I said to myself.  Been looking for a place like this in the east valley forever.  Cozy, comfort with a great fireplace inside and killer patio outback.   We had lunch on the comfy couch in front of the fireplace.  Great wine list,  well thought out menu that delivers, and service that fits the food and atmosphere.    Went back with party of 6 for New Years Eve dinner.  The experience was great and the price for the fixed menu was amazingly low for the quality.  The staff was a little busy with the place being packed as it was, but again they delivered the goods.    Thanks Vintage 95....we've been waiting for you for a long time."}
{"text":"Great food & nice atmosphere. It's quiet enough that you can actually visit."}
{"text":"If you are near DT Chandler, stop in for a fabulous cocktail or some healthy eats! Great Wine selection and food is DELISH- Service is prompt and I have been back several times- Great place for lunch, a date, or a dinner with friends!"}
{"text":"Wednesday night. The set up was really cute. Had live music that wasn't too bad. My friend and I sat outside in the back. We ordered drinks which took a little bit of time to come even though there were 5 tables totaling 17 people for both inside and outside. and yes I counted!! We ordered dinner 40 min passed not one waiter checked to see if we would like more drinks or anything. I flagged down our waiter and he said \"Oh let me check\". he apologized and returned to see if we wanted more drinks, we ordered drinks. The food came another 15 min. later but not the drinks. I ordered the tofu dinner which my noodles were extremely hard and the tofu was ice cold. The lamb wasn't well done but burnt. I explain this to our waiter and he apologizes saying he spoke with a manager and they would comp us for the dinner. My guest and I went to speak to the manager. I told him I would pass on the comp but dinner was really bad it like they just threw some food together without taking serving temperature to consideration. We all know that could result in food poisoning, illness or death. I understand every place of business, person and or establishment is entitled to an off night. However I would not recommend this place anyone due to the service alone."}
{"text":"I just moved here from California retired from the state. I've been wanting to stop in and last week I did. I was more than happy with my wine selection and the food was excellent.  I've owned restaurants before and this one have my vote. ..it's going to be my once a week treat.  See you there."}
{"text":"Good for drinks, apps, and atmosphere.  Not good for corporate events, large parties, dinners  I enjoy Vintage 95 on a regular basis but only for happy hour for a few drinks and some apps. There are good deals for wine and flatbreads. The atmosphere on the patio is quite lovely. Service is pretty good but it depends on your server. A few of the servers are pros, really know their stuff, and want to make your experience positive. Others are not as attentive and friendly. So it really depends. In my opinion, the ambiance, the cool firepit, live music, and good specials are worth it if you are planning to head over for some drinks after work. You will really enjoy yourself.  Planning an event for a large group is a completely different story and I highly discourage anyone from considering this. I worked with a one of the Vintage 95 managers to plan an event for about 14-15 people for several weeks. At first, I was very happy with their willingness to work with my budget, menu preferences, etc. As we got closer to the event, however, the responsiveness dropped but upon a few friendly nudges, eventually we got the menu, date, prices set. When I showed up with my large group, the event fell apart. The server didn't realize we had a prix-fixe menu, wasn't aware of any of the requests I had made in regards to drinks/ bottles of wine. It was as if I hadn't even made any preparations in advance. He seemed embarrassed and did whatever he could to make repairs. I was embarrassed to be hosting such a poorly run event but we all tried to stay light-hearted. First round of drinks and appetizers was pleasant.   Then we waited over an hour for the main entrees to come, because, surprise, the chefs were probably unprepared. Food was mediocre at best and the efforts I had taken to have a light, family-style tapas type of meal (which the manager had actually suggested to me, not vice versa), was completely ignored. Dinner was awkward. Food was not great. I was disappointed to say the least. I think all would have been made better if the manager would have come out, apologized for the inconvenience or misunderstanding and perhaps offered some desserts or an appetizer... something, anything to show they recognized they did not meet expectations. Aside from our server being great and doing his absolute best, the rest of the management staff didn't make much attempt to have us leave on a good note. Having worked in the food industry myself for many many years, this is just not cool.  What is worse, I emailed the original manager, who I worked with to plan. Not a mean, what in the world happened, type of email.. just a casual note praising the service but pointing out the obvious misses. I didn't receive so much as an  acknowledgement. Again, not cool.   So here I am, compelled to give you the good and the bad. I think this place has excellent potential and has an awesome vibe for chilling. If you're looking for something more serious and prepared however, not the best place.   I will continue to go to Vintage 95 for happy hours.   My other work events at Chop, The Mission, The Living Room, Kona Grill, and Firebirds have all been much better experiences. Try one of those if you're planning to go with a large group."}
{"text":"No cook no food after 10? Dumb. Get drunk though. Kitchen closed go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Excellent wine bar with a great quiet atmosphere. The patio is very intimate with small firepits perfect for medium sized groups of friends. I will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Three stars is for the flavor of the food. Unfortunately it wasn't well executed. So for execution I'd give it more like 2 stars.  The drinks took so long that the food had arrived before we got them.  But the food wasn't what we ordered unfortunately. The waiter was very nice and he fixed it as quickly as he could.  But even then the execution wasn't great. The turkey panini was flat grilled on dry bread so it crumbled as you picked it up.  The flavor of the bruschetta was good but again the execution made it hard to eat. The bread was sliced but the toppings were put on after.  Standard flatware isn't sharp enough to cut through prosciutto so I destroyed it trying to serve it to my table mates.    So generally we were treated well and liked the food but the execution just wasn't really good enough to bring us back again."}
{"text":"Like the 5 star rating says...Woohoo!  As good as it gets!  I would challenge those reading to find a better setting...inside or out on the patio for a great night out in Chandler.    We attended to celebrate my wife's birthday, as well as 4 others that attended Vintage 95 last night.  We had a party of 16 and the service was great.  The server was sharp, quick to meet our needs, and a pleasure to talk with.  Many in our party had never visited and they all loved the atmosphere...and the company of course!  One of the great things about Vintage 95 are the cheese plates, served on butcher block, with your personalized choices of cheese, (you can personalize your meat choices to if you wish) they have nuts, olives, dried fruit...all which pair great with your favorite wine.    We love wine and if you love wine or are interested in tasting wine, Gavin, the owner, has created a remarkable wine list  and is very acommodating to all of his customers...Just ask for him or his manager and they will help with wine selections and then sit back and enjoy the live music, and the fire place.  AND ALL of this is in downtown CHANDLER!  Gavin and his partners have done a great thing the the city in the first 3 months of his business...and he reported it is even going to get better with dinner service soon...we can't wait.  See ya there! Don't miss this find!"}
{"text":"Brie was boring. Everything white/yellow and mushy. Grain salad was good but needs better presentation. I was only customer at the bar and GM was here talking to/training his staff and all ignored me. GM was arrogant. Had employee make him a stiff drink at 4 pm while he talked about his workouts (not in good shape).  Won't come back. Weird vibe."}
{"text":"Food: fantastic. Among our group we shared the pork chop, the duck, and the cheese plate. Great cocktails, too! The food will do a much better job speaking for itself than I can describe.  Service: our waitress was a little weird/awkward but very prompt.   Interior is very luxe-- big cozy chairs and sofas, rustic decor.   I live in the Biltmore area-- this is SO worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I made reservations through yelp for our anniversary, notating the special occasion. I was disappointed that the restaurant this not acknowledge the special night for us. Food was ok. I though the artisan board was very small for the price. Bruschetta was tasty, but not nearly as good as The Living Room or  Postinos. Service was very good."}
{"text":"A really cool little spot and it would be great if it were slightly less expensive. A good spot for a first date or something like that, but as I said too pricey for a regular hang out"}
{"text":"Went there tonight ( Wednesday)  it was so relaxing.  Celebrating a mellow a birthday with wine and girlfriends. Service was excellent and price great. Wed they have happy hour 4pm-close. Nice wine selection and tasty food. Will go back. Hubby will like the beer selection and Scotch."}
{"text":"Excellent party at Vintage 95 tonight. Hosted by Realtor Henry Wang and his team.  Food and drinks were a \"10\" The staff did an amazing job.  Kudos to Vintage 95....well done.  Thank you Henry for another fun  Client Appreciation Party."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, as was the cocktail. Happy hour had good options, and the ambiance was very enjoyable. I especially liked the lamb platter. The dessert was enjoyable but a little underwhelming. I plan to return; we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner!"}
{"text":"We went during their Sunday Funday specials, and it was great! We got a cheap bottle of sparkling wine and enjoyed the adorable atmosphere. We also ordered the warm brie, which came with apricot jam, hummus, grilled veggies and pita - yum!  This is a cute gem in Chandler and definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"My husband & I came here for our 24th Anniversary. We had a great time. Great attentive service. Food was wonderful & just what we had hoped for. The ambiance was quiet and comfortable. The chairs were thick fabric high end chairs. There are also couches if you want to lounge & eat!. We had the Moscato which is our favorite."}
{"text":"Stopping in for happy hour drinks and apps.  Great patio, service as so-so.  Would return for happy hour, but menu was not appealing enough to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Tried Vintage 95 for the first time.  Friendly staff and fun atmosphere.  A pretty solid wine list, especially wines by the glass.  The menu is about right...variety but not overwhelming.  Our table tried the short rib, grouper, and pork chop.  The portions were adequate and the presentation was inviting.  We all enjoyed our own dish, but shared bites and agreed that all the food was delicious.  Service was prompt and attentive.  A young lady was playing guitar and singing near our table but we were still able to converse without difficulty.  We plan to come back and try more menu options.  Definitely our kind of place!"}
{"text":"Parking is terrible, seating is lacking. Open and spacious room, but cramped seating space. This place could benefit from removing either the couches or a few of the tables, so people dont bump into your table or chair as they try to use the restroom or exit the building.  Our waiter didn't seem to know much about wine varietals. He basically stood there waiting for us to decide without any recommendations from his own wine list. Here's a thought.....if someone is unfamiliar with your particular wine list, ask them questions about what type of wines they enjoy? What kind of palette experience they are looking for. Simple enough for anyone to be able to recommend a wine or two from their own list, assumimg they have done their homework. Not all Cabs are alike, buddy! Hmmmmm, and you call yourself a wine bar?  He did, however know enough about the menu  to recommend a decent dish.  This \"wine bar\" is like many others out there. It's the perfect place for people who don't know a thing about wine, but want to pretend they are sophisticated. For the rest of us...do your homework, and go to a tasting room where the people can make a solid recommendation to please your palette."}
{"text":"Really nice place to spend an evening with good friends, the bruschetta was wonderful, the service friendly and courteous and the atmosphere was really nice, with live music that was not too loud and quite lovely.  They have a really nice wine list with a variety of reds and whites at various price points from moderate to pricey.  I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Amazing little wine bar! They have some seriously wonderful appetizers. You can't go wrong with the cheese board, the flatbreads, the charcuterie board, or the warm brie... They're all to die for! OH, the olives are great too! I wasn't thrilled with the shrimp and tomatoes to be honest, but that was my only disappointment. One more thing I was simply so bummed about was they discontinued the rock shrimp and that was my FAVORITE. I still ask every time I go in just to see if they will bring it back. :) You just cannot beat the wine and beer selection, the delicious food, and the great ambiance. This is a must try!"}
{"text":"The food here was good, not great, but good. The ambiance was perfect for a lounging and vino.  I get it was a bit overpriced - but we may go back sometime. The service was really good, but I just wasn't wowed by the food."}
{"text":"Great spot that I highly recommend. Good wine selection and food, excellent ambiance that is perfect for a date night and plenty of options around to check out."}
{"text":"Went here yesteday and sat out on the patio. A little pricey for what we typically spend on a night out, but great for a special occasion. We had the vintage flatbread, seabass, and their s'more dessert. All amazing and very very tasty. Great atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome! Check out the Brickhouse next door.  Much better drinks and food. By the way...they don't sell smores for dessert any more."}
{"text":"Absolutely as good as it gets!  We went for lunch to specifically try the Vintage burger because we've had a hard time finding a fabulous burger here in the east valley...but we found it at Vintage 95.  That's as good a burger as I've ever had and I've had a few thousand over my lifetime.  My wife had the pork belly tacos and fell in love with the fusion of flavors on her plate. We agreed that our entrees were SO GOOD that it would be hard not to get them again when we revisit Vintage 95...probably tomorrow!  Our server, Austin, was a fabulous representative of the restaurant and was super attentive and helpful.  He suggested the strawberry cake for dessert and WOW that too, was amazing.  We're foodies and love to eat out and are always hopeful that we'll get great service and great food...but that rarely happens.  Vintage 95 offers excellent service and excellent food in a really cool, relaxing, comfortable environment.  Vintage 95 just vaulted to the very top of our list of favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Meet some friends for happy hour a few weeks ago.  Great place for wine and appetizers.  Service was good and food was great.  Definitely recommend this one."}
{"text":"I have been to Vintage 95 twice, and both times were top notch.  I love the ambiance of this place, especially when it's nice enough weather to sit outside.  There's a decent variety of bruschetta, from traditional to brie with pear, pistachio, and I don't even remember what!  There's plenty in an order to split, and I've also split a burger or panini afterward.    The turkey panini was crazy good.  It was one of those times where I was stuffed, but could not stop eating.  Sweet potato fries and a nice glass of wine round the meal off perfectly!  I'd recommend this restaurant for a date, lunch with the girls, or other small group.    I'll just go back to daydreaming about that panini..."}
{"text":"Great wine bar, excellent atmosphere, menu and wine-expert staff. It doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"Great time at Vintage 95 Saturday night!  Started out with happy hour wines, deviled eggs and garlic fries. Garlic fries were OK, but the eggs were phenomenal!  We then moved to a table and had the scallop appetizer.  Great presentation and excellent preparation.  Followed that w/ the Ahi with Kimchee, on rice cake with a hot pepper sauce!  Outstanding prep for the ahi, seared just so lightly.  The Kimchee had a dry heat type of seasoning which was unusual and excellent.  The hot pepper sauce went great with the Ahi.  Wife had the Bruschetta mix, which was equally good.   Wrapped it up with the coconut and banana Tres Leches.  Well made,  and not overly sweet.  Couple these wins with the knowledge of Jason the Somelier and our waiter Axel, and Vintage 95 is a must do again!"}
{"text":"A place for the senses!!  As soon as you walk in, you're greeted with warmth from the hostess staff,(first impressions start at the front, and are very crucial). we decided to belly up to the bar, and were instantly guided with knowledge and grace from the bartender( I forgot his name). With a chef and wine driven concept, I usually hand my menu to the server/bartender, and let them order for me, and which I did in this case, and he guided us perfectly. We started with the bruschetta sampler, Brie app, and Italian flatbread, wow!! I asked the bartender to recommend a red wine with everything, and the cab he chose was perfect. As we enjoyed our culinary picassos, I gazed around and enjoyed the rustic feel of the brick walls and exposed ceiling, and the big leather sofas next to the fireplace was a really nice touch. Definitely a place to bring someone special in your life that you just want to chill with and relax with. We then moved on to the tomato bisque, which was perfectly silky and not heavy at all. After that, the cheeseburger (a must have). If I could sit there for 24 hours and enjoy every menu item, I would, my taste buds were very happy.   I'm no food critic, but if I was, this place would be on top of my list of places to go. A real gem......nuff said. a place for foodies with crucial palates, and a genuine style of service without the snot. Good job guys, I'm sold."}
{"text":"Cool little spot. Love the bar and the couches for lounging and enjoying a glass of vino. Food is also really nice. I love the beet salad with chicken. There is something about the chicken, always moist and flavorful. Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"A group of us were deciding where to go for Sunday brunch, and the couple that was coming along recommended Vintage 95. The patio was nice and the decor was lovely...but that is about all I have nice to say.  My boyfriend ordered the pulled Pork Chiliquiles, I ordered the Banh-Mi Pork Tenderloin Sandwich. The other couple had Hawaiian Egg breakfast and Vintage Poutine. Their food came out to their liking but the food my boyfriend and I ordered may have been made at an entirely different restaurant.  His pulled pork chiliquiles were so salty, that after eating half...he abandoned them, forfeiting the option to take it home.  Mine on the other hand was a bit worse...The pork sandwich was coated in a sauce and under it was a grayish, dry slice of \"roasted pork\". I bite into it and was immediately introduced to a rancid, sour flavor with the consistency of jerky....I let my boyfriend (whom is a true garbage disposal when it comes to food, I assure you) and the other couple try to make sure it wasn't just me. They all agree that the meat had turned. I let the waiter know...who didn't seem to care either way. He asked if I wanted something else and seemed bit impatient while I looked.  The manager came and visited us, letting me know that they make their food fresh every morning and told me the rancid taste is due to  \"a different flavor profile than I am use to\".  I am not sure what flavor profile he likes, but sour, spoiled, meat isn't for me....so yes it is very different from my preferred flavor profile.   I decided I would try the Hawaiian egg breakfast, it was better but very salty and greasy.  Needless to say my boyfriend and I won't be returning and 6 hours later my stomach isn't happy.  Sometimes Wine Lounges need to be Wine Lounges...and not food establishments."}
{"text":"Great live music and it was cozy by the fireplace.  I recommend the Flatbreads.  Salmon Bruschetta was flavorful and very good, but the bread was very thick and was not toasted.  The seating was very crowded and we ended up with a side table...literally...otherwise, it was a pleasant experience and I would go back...just being more careful about where we sit."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been twice for happy hour and not been disappointed! Great wine, delicious appetizers and cozy seating inside and on their back patio! Have to try dinner next!"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and wine selection. I'd go there for wine and appetizers but not dinner. Food was good but not great. We ordered NY Strips Ned rare. One was cooked as requested, the other was med. cauliflower purée on the duck dish was cold. Service was extremely slow."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here three times and have always left very pleased. Food is always fantastic, wine list isexcellent, and service has been good. Also great AZ draft beer selection."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with a friend. We ordered bruschetta and my favorite was the pistachio one. Very yummy. The service was good. We ended up splitting an app and entrée and they split up the food for us which was nice. We ordered a burger medium well but it came out rare which was disappointing. The burger itself looked better than it tasted but the fries were good.  I could take or leave this place though, hence three stars."}
{"text":"This is my new FAVORITE Place to go in downtown Chandler!!!! The atmosphere is wonderful (I can't wait for patio weather to sit out on their gorgeous patio!) I love the exposed brick and older building feel...makes me feel like I'm back home (Pennsylvania) when I'm inside the place. The food is INCREDIBLE!! Honestly, the brushetta is some of the best I've had. I compare all wine bar brushettas to Postino's which is one of my favorite, and I gotta say this is right up there. The one with the salami and ricotta is probably my favorite, it's to die for!! The pistachio/date or fig/with a maple flavor is also a fav. Honestly they are ALL good...the artichoke one is another fav...I could go on and on ;-) I had one of the dinner specials a few weeks ago, a monk fish over gnocci with an asparagus creme sauce...OH MY! It was SOOO good. I hope they special it again. A friend had their tomato bisque soup and their fries and I tried both and they were great. The fries are addictive. The wine list is huge and I haven't been disappointed yet. I've tried their chocolate dessert which was wonderful. Our service has always been on-point as well. They have a great happy hour special if you order a bottle you get a FREE brushetta plate or the meat plate...you just can't beat that!! If you haven't been there GO...you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. Have been for wonderful dinners in the past so thought we'd try brunch. Frittata was watery, toast cold, served with no butter or preserves, fruit must have been leftover from the night before, brats dry as a bone. Potatoes overdone. Only redeeming quality was the iced coffee, but even that was served with heavy whipping cream that separated. Service excellent and they did comp one of our meals. Not sure if there's a different chef for brunch but they need to go back to culinary school:("}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant! Great everything - menu and service. If you visit Old Town Chandler be sure to experience this wonderful establishment. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"What I expected VS. what I got.  I ordered the trout. I thought for $27 I ordered a wild caught poached filet.  What I received was dirty tasting farm raised broiled filet. I can tell a big difference and I think alot of us can. Step your game up. I expected better."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and have to say really enjoyed it. In fact despite some of my family members leaving while making a big scene because they don't know what good food is, everyone who remained loved it. Even our waitress was amazing. We will be back."}
{"text":"Classy and cute little spot. Good for a nice date. They have a lot of wine foods but we ordered two of their deserts. The coconut tres leche and the Smores one. The coconut one was amazing and I loved the cream that came with it. The Smores was ok. A little too chocolatey and sweet for me. But we will definitely go back and try out their food menu. Their outside balcony area looked really nice too."}
{"text":"Warm, classy, and divine. Three words that describe the food, wine, and music. I had the watermelon salad with salmon, and the mix of flavors was indescribable. My husband had the beef tenderloin (recommended by the waitress), and he was making all sorts of sounds and comments about how amazing it was. The waitress gave excellent recommendations, and we weren't disappointed in the slightest. The live music was phenomenal...the artist had the most intriguing and distinctive voice. I was sad when she packed up to leave before we were done. This place is a must-try for downtown Chandler. The only drawback is the price tag, but I believe it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday dinner once and I really liked the food and the service was great too I went on a night that had live music and it was very enjoyable. Drinks were super good!"}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I dined here last night and had great time!    The service was fantastic!  I especially want to thank the host who called and confirmed my reservation and after telling her that it was our first time dining here she reserved a table by the fire.  It is a great historic location and I enjoyed learning about the history from our server.  I am always in search of the perfect Manhattan so we started off with the Mainstay Manhattan  It was a great blend and I enjoyed the fact that it was served up.  We started off with the artisan board, which was a little smaller then I was expecting, however I enjoyed how they let you pick your meat and cheese from a wide selection.  Next, we shared a BLT with light raspberry vinaigrette.  We also shared the short rib braised in a mole sauce which was fantastic, the sauce had great flavors and the meat was very tender.  Our server split both of the entrees without us asking which was appreciated.  As the name states, they have an extensive wine list we tried a bottle that came recommended and it did not disappoint - Random Ridge.    I look forward to going back here when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Over served a belligerent customer at the bar who fell over in his bar stool hitting our table and spilling wine all over us.  Manager told us the patron was \"done\" instead he got the guy another drink.  Meanwhile our bottle of wine was wasted and shirt was ruined.   Service of the year award..."}
{"text":"My wife and I both loved this place! The appetizer, beer, and burger was outstanding, and the service was very good.  We were seated in a cramped table next to where people were waiting for a table, but we enjoyed the food so much that we didn't care. This is a great downtown Chandler restaurant!"}
{"text":"I enjoy spending time in downtown Chandler and It's great to see this place doing so well.  Vintage 95 offers a warm and inviting atmosphere.   The bartender has recommended several red wines, all of which were wonderful.  I've only eaten here once.  We had the bruschetta.  You get to pick a combo of four and all of them had great complimentary flavors.  We also had the Seared Duck Breast with Chipotle Sweet Potato Gratin and a Cherry Mojo and it was excellent.  I'm an avid listener of local music and they have some wonderful musicians here.  I've heard Sarah Vanell  several times and another favorite was Vinyl Station."}
{"text":"I have been to Vintage 95 probably 8-10 times now & normally it could be a 4 star place.  It's typically great for what it is, a local restaurant in the AZ suburbs, that don't always offer non-chain restaurant options.  We went to restaurant week last night & didn't care for it.  The restaurant was almost empty, but the service was super slow.  We were asked to take our silverware off the plates being cleared to use them again; which is fine, but also a weird request of the customers in any typical medium-high-end restaurant.  We were sitting outside & a kitten/it's \"patio cat\" mom were climbing all over the tables.  I mentioned that sadly, I'm super allergic to cats so I didn't want my silverware on the table that we assume previously had cats walking on it.  We all balanced the used silverware on top of our water glasses.  Which throughout the evening someone was always sitting with an empty water glass for 5-10 minutes.  The menu was average & too large of portions for restaurant week, my mid rare steak came out wrong twice; first blue rare, then rare, but at least I could take it home & finish cooking it there correctly.  The cocktails were good, it was a lovely evening weather wise, and the staff was kind.  We will be back, I just don't suggest it for restaurant week or if you have kitty allergies.  Side note, the kitten was precious & we were told it needs a home."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. Ambience is great. Staff even better. A little pricey on the Tuscan blend, $12 a glass, even though a whole bottle is like 20 bux. But I'll do it again. We sooo need more places like this in downtown chandler."}
{"text":"I still like this place... this being the 5th time I've come here.  I wrote this update as this was the first time I actually tried something that wasn't the Vintage Burger or the Charcuterie Board and wanted to share my opinions:  - Warm Brie: ok portion of cheese, though hummus was meager and I think the \"grilled vegetables\" could've been more grilled and grilled-looking (as in grill marks, they looked bare and tasted bare). - House Soup: meh, not a fan.  It was pretty plain and served with very little croutons... not memorable nor something I'd order again - Fall Salad: I was really surprised at how sweet this salad was.  It was spring mix with 3 or 4 little pieces of butternut squash (needs more!) and the maple vinaigrette was completely sweet (duh, it's maple based).. as in they poured maple syrup on the salad and mixed it like that in a bowl.  It was not pleasant because it was just so over the top sweet.  I would not order this again.  Our companions loved their vintage burger, but agreed the soup was plain and not worth ordering.  Our server gal was nice and quick and the atmosphere was, again, great.  Another issue: sitting in the front patio means you sit on these small 'patio' tables that don't allow you to seat comfortably and eat... just an FYI.  Also, when we ordered the Charcuterie Board, they served us 3 slices of bread, so I asked for \"1 more slice\" since there was 4 of us.. she brought 4 more out and charged us for it.. I thought that was kinda crappy - there were 4 of us and we got 3 breads and when I ask for 1 more, I get 4 more and then get charged.  Not cool.   I'm going to have to try some other dishes to figure out if the burger and charcuterie board (and wine and atmosphere) are the only thing worth coming for.  I had a hard time bringing it down to 3 stars only because I really want to like this local place."}
{"text":"Omg... There variety of soup is amazing. Great wine selection. All around pleased."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Wanted to order Arancini. Apparently, I was looking at the happy hour menu but that's what I was given.   Ordered 2 Bloody Mary's and asked if they really make them like the picture your Facebook page posted a few weeks back (showed him the pic) his response, \"yea I guess we can do that. It's a brunch thing normally.\"  It was currently 1:45pm. Brunch is served until 3pm on Sunday. Drink was the worst Bloody Mary I have ever had. I couldn't even finish it.   Asked for a house salad but with romaine lettuce instead of mixed greens. Waiter asked if I wanted house dressing and I asked what it was. His answer, \" I don't really know what it is.\"  I said a side of ranch is fine. Salad comes and it's mixed greens. Forgot the ranch dressing.   I will say the chicken sandwich was delicious.   This is the 3rd time I have been here and won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've had my eye on Vintage 95 for a while & was super excited to have a chance to stop in.  The environment at this wine bar was super relaxing & we really enjoyed the entire time we were there. We started off with some drinks as we had gone for happy hour and then decided to accompany them with an order of the garlic fries & the brie with jam and walnut toast. For the cost of the fries, we thought there was an ample amount, they were garlic-y but not too garlic-y, and the dijonaise that came with them was an absolutely perfect dipping sauce. I'd definitely get them again. We felt similarly about the brie & toast, it was a perfect sized amount to go with some drinks.  We had a little snafu with our meal order but the staff / management was so gracious, we really appreciated it. I had a chance to look at their lunch menu and saw quite a few tempting sections ... We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I think this is the best wine bar in the east valley.  They have a cool patio and inside a few comfy couches by a fireplace.  They give you a free cheese or meat board with a bottle of wine so i rarely need to order any food.  Prices are good and so is service.  Great place for a romantic evening or a few wine-o friends.  I have not had much food there but the free (with bottle order) cheese plates and charcuterie boards are more than enough for me to eat.  If you are not a wine person they also have some real nice beers on the menu including one of my favorites, Four Peaks 8th Street Ale.  Good to see them support their local breweries."}
{"text":"We were here the first week of October for a private party on the patio.  It was a rehearsal dinner so every detail needed to be met - nobody wants the bride to freak out.  Vintage 95 was great in every way.  The food was phenomenal; very different but still well balanced.  The ambiance was perfect.  Luckily for us, the weather was in our favor that night as well.  The wine and beer were ever-flowing thanks to great servers/bartenders.  They never let my glass stay empty and even remembered what I was drinking; not an easy task for a party of that size.  Unfortunately, I live in the bay area of California or else I'd be back on a regular basis.  For all you lucky Phoenicians, you ought to try this place out without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon and the Chandler area was very busy but this place. However, they were too busy to serve us dinner. Had wine and then went up to San Tan Brewery for dinner which is always great. Never again. Too many other choices for wine!"}
{"text":"Whoa!   So I was impressed by the last time I was here and thought it was great.   Here's a tip. Don't buy a Groupon. You will be completely ignored.   1) Ignored. Got a happy hr chard while waiting for my friend. She showed up at 5:07, I was there at 4:50. Ordered a glass of wine at happy hour prices while waiting. Got it prob 10 mins later. 2) Friend shows at 5:07... no waiter until 5:20 ish. (First waiter) Order first course and her wine. 3) Waiter 1 asks about 2nd and 3rd courses. Ordered by 5:30.  (See 23 mins in between) 4) 5:40 Friends glass of wine shows up (2nd waitress) and then 1st course (3rd waiter) 5) Soup and salad complete.... Do you want wine? Water? Nope. No contact after delivered by waiter #1 6) Waitress #2 shows up.. can i take your plates? No water. . No ask of other drinks. 7) Waiter 3 delivers pork belly. No service no wine no water 8)  Pork belly overdone. Still somewhat ok with Johnny cakes. Never talked to, never asked any questions about getting anything else, how is the food etc. 9) Waiting.. waiting.. Enter hostess. Clears. table. 10) 605 main course shows up delivered by waiter 3.  11) Where is wine pairing?  12) 615, almost done with course, wine shows up. 13) 630. Where is a server? No questions, no water, no anything else? Wanted dessert... 13b) Get up and ask hostess for check since we are completely ignored.  14) Hostess takes phone for groupon and gracious enough to do something that isn't her job. 15) Hostess brings wrong check (Not her job) 16) Get up to tell hostess it's wrong check (Not her job) 17) Hostess brings correct check (Not her job) 18) Get all thanks for coming in from waiter 1, waitess 2 who never spent any time waiting on anything.  Forget it. I brought a friend because I had a good experience before. Never again.   Thanks for nothing. Took over an hour and a three quarters for 3 courses and terrible service.   Soup was delicious. Pork belly overcooked  Steak was perfect. Beans were still crunchy.  Will not be back.   I generally am an overtipper on the price of the bill when I have a Groupon... and I always tip on the base price of the meal, not the Groupon price - not this time. But jeez - Groupon discrimination. Not going back."}
{"text":"I am far from a food-snob. I am much more likely to enjoy a PB&J at home then eat at some expensive and fancy 5-star restaurant. Go ahead, call me unrefined if you must.  I took the girlfriend here to try something new. The experience was cool but I didn't particularly get enthused by the food. It wasn't bad... it just wasn't to my liking. With that said, the GF liked it. We ordered the bruschetta which was totally different. You actually pick 4 flavors out of 6 flavors - mix and match how you like. The flavors were not what I was expecting. We got the  Pistachio, Date and Marscarpone; House Made Ricotta, Heirloom Tomatoes and Basil Vinaigrette; Tenderbelly Bacon Jam and Whipped Goat Cheese; and the Prosciutto, House Made Ricotta and Fig Honey. The prosciutto was by far the most \"normal\" of the bunch in my opinion. The tenderbelly bacon jam one was interesting - like a smoky, meat, jelly concoction that really didn't make sense to my tastebuds but was still good. The pistachio one felt like I was eating a gooey trailmix blend on a piece of bread. Again, not bad but just not my style. Maybe someone who likes the finer things in life would enjoy them more than I did. Your mileage may vary and I think I would have enjoyed the bowl of olives more.  I ordered the brazilian steak and the GF ordered the watermelon salad. For mine the brazilian steak was, again, different. It was more like a raw beef hamburger than a steak. Very flavorful but I could have used it less juicy/messy than it was. Still good. I'd get it again. The GF loved her salad.  In general I kind of want to give it a 3 star review. It just wans't anything that wowed me. However, I feel like I walked into someplace that I knew was different and I got what I thought I was going to get... something different. I can't knock a place for doing what they do any more than I can knock McDonalds for not being a 5-star restaurant. For what it aims to be I think it does a very good job at. I'm not hankering to go back but if the GF wants to go back then I'd like to try something different there...  ... maybe the Queen Creek Olives, Italian Flatbread, Salmon, or vintage Burger."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place, the atmosphere the vibe, and the food. We have had drinks here several times before but never eaten. We recently purchased a Groupon deal and really enjoyed our experience. The place was very crowed for a wednesday night and we were glad we had reservations. Service was very good, despite the fact that our server was very busy. Our food was really good, though I must spotlight the salmon dish. It truly was one of the best things I have ever eaten. Marinaded in lemongrass with coconut rice. Everything was paired perfectly!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner with friends visiting from out of town. Our server, Michael, was excellent. He recommended a wonderful bottle of wine and it was a hit. Everyone at the table enjoyed their selections. The musician that night had a beautiful voice and the live music really added to the experience. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I walked in and immediately were put off by the live music, a young girl singing and playing acoustic guitar but, despite our better judgement, decided to stick with Vintage 95 due to our lack of a back up plan. We were seated in the very back, closest to the kitchen and registers, presumably because she and I were the youngest (and most heavily tattooed) patrons in the restaurant.   We were sat directly next to a repugnant couple of 50-somethings who simply would not and could not stop groping each other. Not even reasonable PDA, like her hand under his shirt onto his nasty hairy chest.    My fiancé and I came here to celebrate my promotion at work and we were looking for good cocktails. I prefer whiskey/bourbon cocktails and their online menu looked promising, but the menu we received was incredibly limited in comparison.   The cocktails were decent enough and fairly typical. We ordered the bruschetta which was the best thing we ate, although not by much. We each ordered a flatbread; I had the italian and my fiancé had the vintage, which she felt was entirely too sweet. The sauce on my italian flatbread tasted like chef boyardee.   As the night went on the young girl's live music became more irritating and her voice more shrill. Frankly, I don't need to hear multiple Sara Barielles covers while I'm trying to enjoy my sub-par meal. To accompany the undesired entertainment, a little girl who apparently had just come from a ballet recital began dancing in the middle of the restaurant.  Our server was honestly a little below standard but she was probably the best part of our dining experience, so we weren't offended. By the end of  the night we were more than relieved to be out of Vintage 95 and will not be coming back.  If you enjoy over priced sub-par food, 50-something PDA, and 6 year olds in tutus dancing to abrasive live music then Vintage is for you."}
{"text":"Table was ready for 4 and a baby. I've been here for dinner and drinks but never been here for Sunday brunch so decided to give it a try. Actually the original intention was to find chocolate banana pancakes from the day before but noticed it was only a brunch for Sunday- not Saturday. Looking at the menu the first item that caught my eye was the chilaquiles for $10. I've had it at a different restaurant and had to try it for comparison purposes. It was quite unique in that the tortillas was cut up strips and fried. Some were covered in Oaxaca cheese and cotija  cheese and red pepper coulis with some shredded green chili pulled pork hidden here and there and a sunny side up egg on top and some sauce. Not too bad. It could have had a little more sauce for the extra fried tortillas and a little bit more pulled pork. Others ordered the Bear Republic (chicken breast sandwich with avocado, lettuce, tomato, and bacon with a side of dill mustard like potato salad) for $12.50, and the Picadinho (diced NY strip steak, peas, rum sauce, Brazilian rice, 2 eggs made how you like and a side of seasonal fruit) for $16. A list of cocktails are also available like sangria and mimosa. Cool place for brunch."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while.  There is a sincere dearth of eclectic and inventive restaurants in the east valley in my humble (albeit) transplanted to AZ opinion and I've admired the menu here for a while.  So happy I had a chance to enjoy it for lunch and was not at all let down.  Bruschetta was fresh, creamy, with wonderful variations on top perfect bread. My lovely friend got the special salmon pasta and I had the Havana (having just seen Chef, in the mood for a Cubano), and everything was simply perfect.  Our waitress was great, manager checked in on us and as my friend and I had not seen each other for a while, sat for a 4 hour lunch and was never made to feel like we need to \"move it along.\"  Even got iced teas to go (a personal favorite touch for me).  Now, onto the décor and ambience, a mixture of tables and comfy chairs and couches for wonderful conversation areas.  Don't be mislead by the \"wine bar\"...which is most definitely it is..because it is a full menu restaurant.  I will most definitely come back for dinner and many more lunches.  Downtown Chandler is a nice little gem."}
{"text":"Came for NYE. The place was pretty dead but we went anyways. Good music by 2 guys. On our way out, we saw a rat run by! The musician saw him too! Wont be returning."}
{"text":"We did the Groupon thing here with friends. The atmosphere, salad and appetizers were wonderful. The downside  to our visit were the entrees and the live entertainment. My wife's hamburger and my flatiron steak were way overpriced, even with the Groupon deal. The steak was served over beans that did not compliment the flavor. Our friend's salmon was very good but the vegetable entrée was a little strange tasting. Don't bother with Groupon for this place. We may return but it won't be for the entrée, probably be for a glass of wine and an appetizer. We will skip the entertainment as well. I never was a big melodica fan."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once a few weeks ago for a surprise brunch and yesterday for my friends birthday. The food is really amazing we ordered the bruschetta (the bacon jam and the salmon with salsa verde are full of flavor) pork belly, and the shrimp appetizers were tasty as well. For the main entrees we had the ahi, duck breast and the flatiron steak. Everything tastes so good, and cooking duck breast is very hard. So it was a pleasant surprise to have it done properly not too greasy or too dry and it had a good spice and flavor from the blackberry sauce. Our server was very friendly, knowledgeable, and guided us through the menu and the wine list. As for breakfast they have great fluffy pancakes that you must try! Also the egg in the hole with a fontina cheese sauce is perfect for brunch. Skip Postinos and give this place a try, the food is way better and they actually have a good wine selection!"}
{"text":"Bruschetta was amazing. Ambiance was perfect for a valntines day date. Service was great."}
{"text":"Great wine bar, really nice atmosphere, and delicious hors d'oeuvres and entrees."}
{"text":"i like the relaxed atmosphere of this place. it's nice and dark for a dinner date and comfortable enough to grab just a glass of wine at the bar.   food here is about average. there was really nothing stand out that we had during our meal but everything was cooked well and served nice and hot. service is also good, with waiters/waitresses being friendly and attentive.bar staff is pretty nice however it gets a little crazy for them during the dinner rush and you could be left waiting for a drink for a while.  this place also has a lovely patio that is well equipped with heaters and a large fire pit. while i know it gets a little too cold in the winter to sit outside, this patio is perfect for fall and even summer nights.   all in all a decent place in chandler for some relatively swank ambiance and a good wine selection."}
{"text":"I love the leather sofas, comfy chairs, the fireplace, brick walls and the general ambiance of this restaurant.  It's very warm and very conducive to just sitting in conversation while having a glass or two of wine.  I had the tomato bisque which was very good and the rock shrimp which was also good.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and knew his wines. My one negative though is in the pricing - too high for the dishes.     I'll go back again because I love settings in which the conversation is the art form.  Maybe next time I'll be there in time for happy hour."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing. I was there alone on a sunday afternoon and I was treated like royalty. I orderd the Green Chile pulled pork sandwich and it was the best sandwich I have ever had.  -The egg bun was the best part.  My server Lexi was knowledgeable and fun, she even reccomended a great cocktail that was thouroughly enjoyed."}
{"text":"Had such great hopes for this establishment. We have been here four times pervious and it was great the food and serving portions were wonderful. Unfortunately on our return tonight they have redesigned their menu and portion sizes. We questioned the waitress on the serving sizes and she recommended that we bring it up with the Manager since she had, had the same response from several people recently. We have pictures of our food from the previous visits, because we are foodies and like to share pictures of the happy finds we are enjoying. The Manager tried in many ways to tell us it was the same size serving, even though the picture was way more bountiful on all of the previous visits. We finally gave up on trying to discuss it with him and went about our dining experience. Nothing was the same even the combinations on the bruchetta board was different. You can definitely tell that they have scaled everything back to save on cost and possibly even changed food distributors. We are very sad because we probably won't go back and we had been so excited to have a place like this so close to home. We hope they change and if they do please let us know."}
{"text":"I'm rating this solely on the hostess. We went in 12-30-16 to enjoy a glass of wine and watch the duo play guitar.  Upon arriving the hostess asked us where we would like to sit. My aunt pointed to an empty couch. Hostess replied \"obviously thats taken because there are girls sitting across from it.\"  Puzzled, I said \"ok, why don't you just seat us then.\"  Her reply, \" yes I'm the hostess that's my job\" with sincere bitchery.  I just stood there and stared in complete shock. I could have just slapped her in the face. But I held my composure and she sat us. Never ever have we been insulted by anyone let alone a hostess. What terrible service. This establishment needs to take a closer look at this young lady (if that's even what you can call her).  She is the first face everyone sees.  We should have just left but really wanted to try out the wine.  Well OBVIOUSLY the most she will ever be is a hostess if she continues to be such a rude brat. Millennials are the worst!   Won't be going back here. Wine was overpriced as well."}
{"text":"Great spot for chilin drinking wine or for date night.  Nice large patio and inside decor is dark and comfy, with couch seating as well as tables.  Most of the eats are good especially bruschettas.   Bit pricey place but normal for these type deals."}
{"text":"Their happy hour $5 wine is outstanding and not your basic cheap stuff that you might find at some sports bars.   For happy hour munchies try the chicken skewers and the shrimp.  Outstanding. The servers that we have had are great.  The manager visits each table to check satisfaction- major points!! Tip: call for a reservation- We've tried to get in during the live music time (good band) and it was too long of a wait for us. This is probably not a place to take young children.  If you are on a date or just hanging out with friends it is fun. Downtown Chandler is great.  Somebody on the city staff is on the ball with getting the area rehabbed and a great place to visit.  You'll find lots of free parking unlike downtown Tempe. Be on the lookout for events in downtown Chandler.  For example, they have a great jazz festival with several bands."}
{"text":"Love this place! The service was great!! Everyone was super friendly! The atmosphere was just incredible"}
{"text":"Greeted by Axel who saw us through a wonderful 3 course meal and wine pairing. From Tomato Bisque and Gem Salad to the Vintage Board and then Flat Iron Steak for us both...it was all delicious beyond expectations!! Great service...thank you Axel and delicious food...thank you Chef!!"}
{"text":"Nice place if you have time for a long and leisurely lunch. I have walked by this place many times, never thinking it would be good but I'm glad I have it a try today. Yummy tomato soup - tasted smoky - the burger was delicious but I needed a nap after eating it (it's big enough to share and still leave stuffed as a turkey on Thanksgiving)."}
{"text":"Had family that was going to a show at the Chandler Arts Center, so we wanted something close by that was nice. Chose this place off of Google Map and so glad we did.  The hostess was friendly and had our table ready and waiting with ice water already set up.  Our server Axel was very friendly and helpful with choosing drinks and food.  We started with the happy hour brie for $5 which is very small but very good, I would say only shareable if you are getting something else. We also tried the bruschetta board which almost every restaurant has these days.  The toppings we chose were delicious and the bread was good but a little too thick for my liking. For dinner I had the Ahi Tuna topped with a homemade kimchi over what I can only describe as rice patty heaven!!!  I also tried one of the salads which had pistachios, banana chips and dried papaya I think, either way it was also really delicious.  Its a great place to sit and have some bites and wine or for dinner.  They have a small patio with a long table that looks like fun with a larger party and cooler weather."}
{"text":"Hand down one of only two places in Chandler that I would put on par with some of the best I have been to almost anywhere.   Enjoy."}
{"text":"Fiance surprised me with a 3 course date night at Vintage 95 for Valentine's Day! I'd been wanting to try it for a while. When we first arrived we sat at a table that had air blowing directly on us and my fiance kept sneezing and his eyes watering, so we asked to move tables. Our first waiter was hilarious, then after we were moved we switched waiters.   He seemed less than thrilled to have us in his section. The food was good! We tried the salad, soup, chicken, steak, strawberries with prosecco cream and chocolate almond torte. I had the wine pairings which were also great.  We generally enjoyed the building and the atmosphere, but I will say the waiter's mood did dim ours quite a bit."}
{"text":"We went to Vintage after dinner one night for drinks and dessert, with some friends. It was very cozy and had a nice live 2 man band, I got the tres Leche cake and it was pretty amazing. Service was good and good and drinks were good. I'd have to go back to the the food and review again later."}
{"text":"Great patio (in the back)...sit at a table or lounge on the couches. Servers were extremely knowledgeable, good wine recs. Brie appetizer was delicious, the accompanying hummus was a bit bland. Salmon and lamb entrees flavorful, fresh and good portion size. Service was timely. Absolutely a chill environment, you can get in and out OR you can hang out!!"}
{"text":"Love the deals offered on Yelp. Went to a yoga event at the Crowne Plaza and came over here and paid $15 for $30 worth of food. My friend had their bruschetta board with four different options, I got to try a few and I liked them. I had the Sea Bass which I was not a fan of unfortunately. I expect Sea Bass to be light and this was very heavy. I will admit I tend to compare all Sea Bass to one I got in Texas, but this was a very heavy dish and after sweating outside in The July heat it was to much. They had live music and I liked the decor. Additionally the service was good and I appreciate they didn't give us a second glance when we walked in yoga pants. I will come back again and try something else."}
{"text":"wow. this place is a gem.  highly recommend it if you're looking for a great place to take a date or chill with some friends out in the patio over some wine.   visited friends in the phoenix area over thanksgiving vacation and they took us here on a Saturday night.  i dont know much about the chandler area but this place could easily rival any of the popular wine lounges here in san diego.    as for food, our group ordered a bunch of the bruschettas, flatbreads and a couple sandwiches to share family style.  we all enjoyed all of it, i especially recommend the fig chutney, that was absolutely amazing.  from the sandwiches, the shrimp blt definitely stuck out as my favorite.  overall, everything was very good and the service was great.   as for the wine, great selection. the staff was very helpful in helping us pick out the perfect bottle based on what we like. in fact, i think i found my new favorite wine thanks to them.  if you're a wino like me, you'll love this place.    as for the ambiance, they nailed it.  awesome patio and great decor.  the attention to detail is definitely noticeable. very chill spot.   ps. check out the door to their wine cellar, i want that in my house. it's gorgeous."}
{"text":"Dined here this evening on a recommendation from a colleague.  Ordered wine, brochette, and an entree.  The bread used for the brochette is way to think, making it more of an entree than an appetizer.  The entree came to the table cold for a hot dish. Serve shared the entree is par baked and must have not been heated up thoroughly  Overall not a bad place, just the \"bar of expectation\" was set way to high.  Maybe another try some other time."}
{"text":"I really wanted  to like this place.  I am hoping we just had back luck given many positive Yelp reviews; however our experience was less than adequate.  There are many choices for restaraunts in the valley and I would suggest this one be avoided. It takes little to make us happy so keep this in mind.  Our server (no intro) initially was not warm and in fact seemed cold so I tried to warm him up a bit and asked if he smiled? He responded he was fine, \"Just not Mickey Mouse.\"  1/2 a strike maybe as I get not everyone outwardly is happy. In the end he warmed up and tried to make things right.  I ordered Sangria to which I hoped would be amazing but not so much.  I have drank a lot of Sangria in my life and this by far was the worst I have had.   Sangria went back to the bar as kool-aid better. When we did finally get our order, most of the guys who ordered burgers did not get fries despite note of inclusion on the menu.  My husband and I ordered pork sliders and the turkey, jalapeño and avocado sliders.  The BBQ pork sliders were frozen in the middle and the avocado slices in turkey were not ripe.  Really, overall a bit of a miserable food experience on a beautiful Easter Sunday.  Our meal was comped but we ended up eating a side of fries and calling it good.  Our son had pancakes and he ate all 3 and loved them but they looked exactly the same as anything you would make at home. He was happy though. Not a single piece of garnish came on the orders and in fact none of our party of 13+ had any plate presentation going for them at all.  Last straw was the executive chef (picture attached) who must be for oversight only. He spent a good amount of time checking his phone, argued about visibly frozen food when we flagged him down to take ot back and noticeably forgot an apology.  Sorry Vintage 95, we will not be back or recommending you. Bummed"}
{"text":"great food and a great atmosphere, huge patio to unwind after a tough day, great staff"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better food!  The Mister and I were in town for work, and we met a friend here for dinner one night. A company was having a private party indoors, so the hostess seated us in the cozy outdoors dining area.   Our server was new, and she was a bit nervous. But she was super sweet and really did a great job. I think she was mostly nervous b/c the manager kept lurching around staring at her. He seemed like a bit of a douche.  We split a bottle of Malbec, and it was delicious and reasonably priced. And then all of us were really pleased with our meals. Here's what we had:  * Grilled Beef Tenderloin, Potato Golden Beet Hash, Tenderbelly Bacon Vinaigrette, Asparagus and a Point Reyes Fondue * Jerked Pork Tenderloin, Gingered Sweet Potato, Tostones, Pineapple Chutney and Coconut Cream * BLT SALAD Mixed Greens, Tenderbelly Bacon, Heirloom Cherry Tomato, Feta Cheese, Garlic Croutons with Rosemary Vinaigrette  All our meals were great, but the beef tenderloin was the true star; if you're craving beef, this is a must-get. The dishes were a bit on the pricey side, but the quality ingredients made it worth the cost.  Tip: Skip dessert and go across the street to Peletas Betty for some amazing popsicle goodness."}
{"text":"Really BAD FOOD and customer service!  Never done a review before but I think they deserved this one."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!   I went here with my date on Valentine's day.  We had a reservation for 8 pm.   We arrived and were sat immediately at the couch in front of the fireplace.   I was immediately turned off by the band,  which was right there by us.   Do they really need this for Valentine's day?  Way too loud.   Our server, Jordyn came over and asked what we would like to start with to drink.   We said just water for now.   She brought that. .. and then we waited. .. and waited. ... after 20 minutes went by I asked another person if we could see our server.   She finally graced us with her presence and we ordered.   I had the salmon,  my date the beef.   After 35 minutes we finally got our food.   We were literally there for an hour before finally eating.   We should have stopped on the way for a snack.   It took another hour to get dessert and finally get the bill.   2 hrs in there.   Food was good,  service. .. well there wasn't any.   Will NOT return."}
{"text":"Went on Friday at 6 pm - just missed Happy Hour and the place was busy and didn't have a reservation but they were able to seat the two of us inside (one of the few cool AZ days). The Patio would have been fine if the temps were at the normal average. Service was attentive and knowledgeable about the wine list.  Had the BLT salad to start which was fresh and tasty with just the right balance of flavors. Went for the Vintage Burger next which  to me,  is one of the best in the Phoenix area - who would have thought a grilled shortrib/angus chuck blend could be so moist and flavourful? Ended up with the Coconut Tres Leche dessert which was just sinful but absolutely right. A great selection of wines with some good value bottles. It shows a commitment and passion to bring some interesting wines to the area. I will certainly go back to sample some more."}
{"text":"It was our first time here. We joined another couple for dinner.  I ordered the shrimp and grits, my husband had the NY strip. Everything from the wine and meat board with olives through to the end of the main course was beyond fabulous! We will definitely be back! Great service too."}
{"text":"Actually really enjoyed the atmosphere here. It is a nice bar & restaurant addition to the downtown Chandler scene. I like the rustic furniture and ocmfy chairs with live music, but their happy hour is what drew us here. Great priced cocktails and decent wines for $5. Our bartender was on top of his game, expertly handling several drink orders and getting them out quickly. They have warm brie and a great charcuterie on the menu. A nice date night place, or spot to go enjoy some wine with your girlies."}
{"text":"Very good chow and great service. It appeared to be patronized by housewives during my one, lunch time visit. Not that tree is anything wrong with that. Came back during the evening for a glass of wine. Still a nice place with mixed crowd. I wasn't sure about the two unsupervised kids taking up the couch, playing Angry Birds on mom's and dad's iPhones. Somewhat inappropriate, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I don't want to leave a bad review. However, as business owners, we felt I needed to. The feedback is the only way to change a problem. The measure of a business is not how they handle good situations, but how they handle mistakes, and every business will make mistakes. I made reservations well ahead of time for 2 I'm the afternoon. I stated in the online reservation comment box that it was for our 45th anniversary. We asked for a window table (only one) and for Nya, a server we had before. My husband got a phone call confirming our appointment and our request. When we get there the table had been given to someone else! We mentioned this and was basically told \"these things happen\". Land he gave a flippant apology clearly not respectful of the importance of this momentus occasion. The table was given to a young hip couple and by what the waiter said, we knew they were just given the table and had not reserved it well in advance. In addition my husband asked why they didn't put a reserved sign on the table and he replied they don't have any! REALLY? Any piece of paper with \"reserved\" hand written on it should do. They could have made everything right just by caring. Last person who appeared to be the owner or manager just listened to this and never intervened. We were polite, not disruptive but we were clearly unhappy. If I owned the business, I would have said, \"we made mistake, I am so sorry. For your inconvenience we will give you a free drink, appetizer, dessert or a coupon, etc.\" or some other nice thing to do. I would have at least given a warm apology and happy anniversary wishes along with superb service to make it right. They were almost empty at the time. We did something we never do, we walked out before ordering and the arrogant owner/manager didn't seem to even care.! Like I said, we were polite, just unhappy that our reservation requests at an off time were not respected. We went (without reservations, of course) to another nice restaurant where immediately upon entering the door and saying it was our 45th anniversary, they treated us like royalty! We will never go back to Vintage 95 because oh their superior, snobby, uncaring attitude!"}
{"text":"Wow...I really liked this place!  The decor was great - very relaxing and cozy.  The service was efficient and friendly.  Everything is great about this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped here when we were in town visiting. Great service, great food & great wine. Not only was the food presentation great but tasted amazing! Huge wine list & the staff do a great job helping you choose a wine you'll like. Also love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was staying in Chandler for a month on business, and I probably ended up eating here 6-7 times because the food was 5 stars, bar was 5 stars, service was 5 stars.  If you like duck--this is the place to get it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great staff, very friendly and knowledgeable. Don't be afraid of the fancy menu, I don't think you could go wrong with anything on there. Great cocktails, they can literally make anything. Even saw them roast a marshmallow for a cocktail, woah. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Decided to meet a friend afterwork and had a wonderful time here. The Brie w apricot spread was delicious and the Italian Moscato is heavenly. The service was warm and friendly. It was a pleasure to know that customer's feedback is taken seriously. The management/owner is a class act!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday party. What a lovely place! Nice decor. The staff are all very friendly and welcoming. The wine was delicious. We got sandwiches for lunch- very very good! The S'more desert was drool worthy. I'll go back if I ever get a chance too."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Vintage and it was mediocre at best.  The atmosphere was the only saving grace.  Service was slow and the food was disappointing.  Perhaps it is just a wine bar and food is not a priority here.   We ordered a \"cheese\" board and portions were skimpy and it was overpriced. So then we tried a flat bread that we imagined would come out warm and it was room temp close to being chilled. The menu should indicate this is not a warm/hot appetizer.  When we asked the waiter if the flat bread should be warm he took it away to 'ask' someone.  The manager came over to our table to explain and agree the temp of this app should be stated on the menu.  No kidding!!!  Maybe something should have been offered in a response to the confusion. We ended our meal with the pork chop dish which we shared.  The pork chop was dry  although the potatoes with it were yummy! $25 potatoes are out of my budget!  We decided not to ever return although we like and have had many good experiences in downtown Chandler, this was definitely not one!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have tried to get a table at this restaurant but reservations are almost always needed if you want to sit inside so it took some preplanning to get a dinner reservation but we were glad we finally did as it had a really great ambiance and great food.  The only suggestion I have is that their live music is turned up louder so you can actually hear it.   The live music was the primary reason why we wanted to sit inside as it creates a nice atmosphere but the restaurant is already a bit loud and they had the musicians mic down to the point where it only felt like it was background instead of feeling like it was a focal point to enjoy.   I did really like the outdoor patio with fire pits and think next time we will sit out there and just enjoy wine and small plates as the dinner prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"Great friendly service.  I recommend a reservation though if you are coming with more than 2 people, even during the week.    Happy Hour is from 3 - 6.  Enjoyed my mojito - it was very strong.  Also the $5 happy hour garlic fries and the $5 brie cheese with bread and jam.  Loved the jam but not so much the walnut bread.  Shared two flatbreads.  Didn't like the Italian that much (though it was my two friends favorite) but the Vintage was amazing!!!  So so so good!"}
{"text":"Loved the bruschetta and the live music!  I would say to skip the tacos (not sure what kind of meat it was).  The service was very friendlly and we loved the deal on a bottle of wine and bruschetta."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Nice outdoor patio + live music + wine  = great date night! Food is delic, warm Brie is a top fave as well as veggie flatbread. Hands down the s'mores desert is amazing - soooo good! Def recommend this place for something intimate or as a group. It's louder inside with live music so if you want to hear Convo  I would recommend sitting outside (weather permitting) since music is more on background."}
{"text":"Last Saturday evening was our third visit to Vintage 95 since moving here from Chicago. The outside dining area was very busy. The couple with us ordered an array of food that presented some challenges for not only the kitchen but also our server Stuart. I can tell you the management went out of their way to make sure we were happy and our server Stuart was EXCEPTIONAL! These guys simple go above and beyond and the food never disappoints! We love this place!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great time. Nice atmosphere, good food, and great drinks. The vintage mule is best IMO. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"we went here last monday for lunch we were 2 of 6 people in the restaurant  around i1140 am, we were prompley greeted n a sorta glad your here way and seated and told are server would be right with us.are server was polite we ordered are lunch our only complaint is are lunch took a good 25 minutes to get to us with like i say 6 people in the restaurant. I asked are server if they had a certain wine on there list which happens to be a friend of mine winnery out of walla walla wa.she said she didnt know that she usually works nites ????????????i dont know what that means ???????? but did not persue but she handed me there wine list so i could try to find it myself ,by the way you do have it ."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch a few times, and I'm definitely a fan. I've tried different entrees each time, and they were all good. The Italian flatbread was tasty, the sandwiches were delicious, and the salads are top-notch. They even have a great beer selection. Staff is friendly. The ambiance is nice. Overall, this is one of the best bars/restaurants for many miles around. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really great food and service. Our waiter, Axel, remembered us from our only other visit in December. He  provided outstanding service both times. The happy hour has a good selection for beer/wine and food.  We will come by each time we visit the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"So sad that this place has gone downhill. We have loved this place since it's opening. However, now that management has changed, the food has gotten pricey, the service lazy, and the wine mediocre."}
{"text":"After writing my last review and then ultimately returning to Vintage 95, I was beyond impressed by the level of customer service we received.  I can't be sure if they saw my last review or not but who cares, what mattered was that they remembered who we were and they came over and personally apologized for what happened to our bikes outside of their establishment and bought our first round of drinks.  It really meant a lot that they remembered who we were and took the time to acknowledge that shitty situation.  We left smiling and impressed and will definitely continue to frequent Vintage 95.  It really is one of the best patio's around, some of the best live music and a great staff."}
{"text":"Love Vintage 95. Great outside area (heated), love the menu, loads of wine choices, and Vinyl Station was playing there - what a wonderful surprise they were."}
{"text":"Some of the best food in the area. Great selection of wines and very personable staff. Comfy atmosphere and great ambiance."}
{"text":"The finest restaurant in the area by far. Fantastic menu with great staff. The setting is super beautiful. An excellent restaurant with real value for your money!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere with exceptional service.  The wait that evening was for thirty minutes where we had time to hang out in the middle of Christmas shopping.  The cozy patio outside was so inviting that we decided to eat at the al fresco bar instead.  I wish I could remember the name of our cute little bartender, she was so sweet!  While the wine list wasn't extensive, the varietals were wonderfully chosen.  Hubby went for the Malbec and I, a Rosé.  The bruschetta seemed like a good pairing for our wines.  It was disappointing when it finally came out.  I could honestly have made this, or better, at home.  Costco goat cheese atop what seems to be pancetta, but tasted like liverwurst, was my least favorite.  The rest are equally dreadful with the chewy day old supermarket french bread as a foundation for non exciting ingredients.  The tomato bisque saved the night.  It was light and tart, with just a hint of cream to warm your soul.    It was more a 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 starts for being local and a potential for being great.  We will be back to try the other offerings, because the atmosphere is just that cool."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is good, wine is meh, atmosphere is WAY too loud with the live band playing in such a tiny place."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for dinner last night. We will be going back. It had a great atmosphere, low lights, good live music.  The service was great, our server Stuart was great, not lingering but attentive which is the perfect balance. Stuart's wine recommendation was on point. I had the lamb and my wife had the sirloin. Both were fantastic. We started with the calamari which the Stuart recommended we have sautéed, again this was fantastic. And for afters we had the coconut tres-leche.  They have a tapas happy hr 3-6 so we will be going back for that next time.  Over all we throughly enjoyed our evening.  I recommend going for an evening post work snack or a romantic date night dinner."}
{"text":"I am not sure if we just really had a bad experience or if other reviewers are totally crazy.  After reading all the great reviews about Vintage 95 we (myself, the hubby and two other couples) decided to venture here.  Things we did like:  The patio is super cute and quaint.  We had some great weather and our server Eric was fantastic.  Plus they had one of my favorite wines-Dr. Loosen Reisling.  Now on to the bad.  We tried the bruschetta which according to many reviews was top notch.  We only tried the goat cheese and bacon jam (out of curosity) and the mozzarella with grape tomatoes.  Eric really talked up the bacon jam making it seem like it would be the most amazing thing I've ever tasted.  It was the complete opposite.  It was very underwhelming and loaded with salt.    I had the ahi tuna dish which was pretty good but again-loaded with salt.  I felt so dehydrated the next day from all the salt I had!  My hubby ordered a burger which came over cooked.  He returned it to the kitchen and they corrected it.  But this is the really bad.  3 of our friends ordered the stuffed poblano.  It sounded like it would be delish.  One of my friends said that hers was cold inside.  Like flat out cold.  Gross.  Then her hubby and our other friend that ordered it said the same thing.  We informed Eric who returned them to the kitchen.  The manager came out to offer his apology and informed them that it would be 5-6 minutes for them to return.  15 minutes later they did.  The EXACT same dishes, not reheated but simply piled with new sauce AND when they brought them back to the table they had no idea who's plate was who's.  The gal that brought them back just set them down like they were brand new dishes-totally ignoring the fact that one of them had been cut into pieces!  SO TACKY.  Needless to say everyone was totally disgusted at that point.  We once again told Eric and he was more then apologetic.  I felt really bad for him actually.  And once again we received a visit from the manager.  He whisked the dishes away and promptly took an order for some salads for them.  Which they actually liked.    I really tried to give this place 2 stars. I mean in the end the service we received was exceptional.  The manager was more then gracious about the situation and rectified the problem, I just can't do it though.   We will not be back.  Ok so after I posted my original review I received the absolute most sincere email from the manager Gavin.  Because of this email I changed my review to two stars and all of us that attended the other night said we would be willing to give it another shot (maybe not order food) because of his email. Plus they did have a great atmosphere on the patio and a great wine list :) I have had bad experiences before and have voiced my opinion but I have never had a manager take the time to review my posted comments and contact me.  So you know never know...maybe we will be back and fingers-crossed our experience will be much better."}
{"text":"The rock shrimp appetizer was amazing... But the thrill ended there. I think the main problem is, I'm a huge fan of Postino's and Vin95 tried, didn't compare. This was the first time in my life that a hostess actually gave us a time that we had to leave, \"we have a table finishing up dessert and we'll seat you there, but the table is reserved for 7:45\". *blink* so we have to vacate the table by that time? Interesting strategy.  I had bruschetta and can't say much about any of my selections. My husband had the seared ahi and it was nice. I had a glass of wine and he had a beer - only one, since we weren't offered another beverage until our meal was complete and plates were cleared."}
{"text":"So... all of my reviews for awhile are going to start with how pleasantly surprised I am by a quality independent restaurant here. I read such bad reviews about the food in the Phoenix area from foodies like myself who come from places famous for their independent food scene. Once again... HAPPY! Granted the meal I ordered was simple. Had the new york strip with green beans.But it was perfect! I ordered medium rare and it was truly medium rare. The steak was quality, the beans were cooked perfectly and spiced beautifully. The one negative was weird.. the plate was tiny. So small that I had to take half my steak off the plate and put it on a side plate to be able to cut it. The sauce was falling over the side and the tiny, avante garde plate had a bizarre swoop in it so i couldn't rest my knife on it without it sliding off. That should really be changed. But back to the good stuff. The bartenders were fabulous! Both recommended wines were perfect, they were friendly and funny and best of all... quick. This is going to become a regular haunt for sure."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The bruschetta was delicious and the wine menu was extensive. The patio ambiance was very laid back with romantic lighting. They had someone playing acoustic guitar inside. Overall I really enjoyed this place and am very happy that it is close by."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere, the back patio was very nice.  Our waitress was very attentive, we ordered the warm brie and hummus... along with a bottle of Malbec, then we decided to order an entrée to share...  We ordered the salmon and they brought it out on 2 plates, the presentation was nice, the salmon was encircled with grits and a green sauce and there were some julienned grilled veggies on top of the salmon but for $22, we basically got a \"taste\" , the entire 2 pieces of salmon couldn't have weighed more than 3 oz and the little bit of grits and veggies could not be considered \"sides\".  The salmon was tasty, I just wish there had been more of it.  I guess we paid for the nice atmosphere.  I would go back but probably just for wine and apps."}
{"text":"What an adorable place.  I've always knows it's been there for the last few years but had never had an opportunity to go.  Urban chic right in the heart of Downtown Chandler.   The inside is really cute and comfortable.  Exposed brick, comfy chairs and tables all set in intimate conversation spaces.  There was a piece live band singing contemporary ballads adding to the ambiance.  We chose to sit outside on the back patio (there is a small front patio as well).  The back patio is really nice and comfortable as well.  Big fire pits surrounded by comfortable couches and other seating areas as well.  Twinkle lights adorn the entire outside and again, more exposed brick add to the vintage urban flair.    There is an EXTENSIVE wine list as well as some really interesting cocktails and beers.  We were only in for drinks but asked to see a food menu and that looked interesting as well.  I can't speak to how well we liked the food but we will try some next time.    The only reason I am not going for the full 5 stars here is that the staff seemed a little stiff.  The hostess who greeted us was somewhat curt and our server was good but no-nonsense.  There wasn't anything wrong with them at all, they just weren't as welcoming to us first timers as I would have thought.  As we were leaving, we passed many wait staff and not one of them cracked a smile or said good-bye.  Really, none of this is a very big deal nor will it stop me from coming back, I just wanted to explain why I didn't give the full 5 stars.  I definitely look forward to giving Vintage 95 another try, and another try, and so on and so on...."}
{"text":"I love this place! The patio is just perfect - high walls, comfy couches and tables, a huge fire pit, heaters and a gorgeous brick facade.   The inside seating is gorgeous, too. Roaring fire, dark wood, brick, leather.  Sitting in The service is fantastic, too. As is the wine list and food.  It is so great to have a place like this in downtown Chandler - instead of Scottsdale. The ambience of old Chandler is cool, too. When we went last night, there was an art walk.   I highly recommend V95. I also recommend reservations - every time I have been here, the place is hopping."}
{"text":"Great deals on 1/2 priced bottles of wine on Sundays, and food is good - not great, but good. Good atmosphere to hang out, and the back patio is great once it's a bit cooler.   First time we went, food was burnt and had to send back; Manager apologized. Came back to give it a second shot, and was pleased."}
{"text":"Have been here 3 or 4 times now and think it's a great place.  Nice atmosphere (inside and outside), good selection of wines and cocktails, and the food has not disappointed in any way yet.  The fish special is always good.  This last time the sea bass was great.  The scallop app is always tasty and cooked just right.  Service-wise, they have been attentive whether we have been at the bar or in the restaurant.  This is a great place to throw into your wine bar or restaurant rotation.  Slowly but surely the east valley is getting a few good places to go to and this is one of them."}
{"text":"I should really come here more often.  Hard to beat.  As I said a year and a half ago, \"OMG this is what eating out should be\".  And it is.  Some unique and tasty items on the menu combining wonderful flavors, good service...truly hard to beat.  I can't pretend to have been everywhere in Phoenix, but this is certainly the best restaurant I know about in Phoenix.  I do prefer their dinner menu to their lunch menu, but both are excellent.  The rest of my previous review still applies.  My one criticism is that they don't have a death-by-chocolate dessert.  But the desserts they do have are very good, and not the typical fare you find in most places."}
{"text":"Great place to grab and drink or meet a friend to chat. A longtime friend and I came here to catch up after a long time of not seeing each other. The waitress was just attentive enough not to be annoying but also was available when we needed. Didn't try the food but there was a pretty good selection of wines. The decor inside is wonderful and cozy, and the patio is a great place to have a group as well. It's in a nice area of town if you want to walk around and see the quaint shops. Definitely a place to visit again!"}
{"text":"Was totally not impresses with this place. Bought a yelp deal, and when I presented it to them, they didn't want to accept it, but they finally did. Service was slow and inefficient. The happy hour food choices were VERY small and overpriced. We had the margarita  flatbread, which was basically 4 crackers with some cheese and a tomato slice. Also the walnut bread with brie. That was a bit better, but still a very small portion. Each were $5. We split a bottle of wine, which was $20. Not too bad of a deal. However, it was a sauv blanc, and it was NOT cold. I asked about it, and they brought an ice bucket to put it in. Overall, I don't think I would return. Too many other options....."}
{"text":"You've just gotta try the rack of lamb! Super service, relaxed atmosphere. Great place all around."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place late on Friday evening for some cocktails. We sat out on the patio which I was very impressed by. The seating was comfortable and clean with a chill ambiance. Our server was very nice and attentive. I ordered a Jameson and cranberry, which is what I would have expected. Others in the party ordered off the drink menu and the drinks were delish!! I can't wait to come back and try their food!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been to in 2014. We spent hours enjoying amazingly priced and unbelievable quality wines and then appetizers and food. I think we were there for 4 hours at least. Our server, John, was extremely attentive and knowledgable about the entire menu. My best advice would be to go during less busy times, like Sunday afternoons or weekdays. The happy hours just can't be beat.  The Artisan plate was one of my favorites. You get to pick and choose from all sorts of meats and cheeses, that the waiter customizes for you.            A good tip with this is to ask for hummus on the side. It makes an excellent combination with the lavash flatbread, and the various cheeses and salamis (and blackberry preserves!!). You get sweet, salty, spicy and the whole spectrum of tastes, just by trying different combinations. every bite is different and delicious in its own way.  The BLT salad and watermelon salad are both not to be missed..and it was great to have a waiter (John) who was sensitive to our tastes and was honest about whether he thought the dishes we selected were going to be a good fit for us or not.   I can't recommend this place highly enough (I rarely give 5 stars), and will be back over and over again."}
{"text":"Great little place to eat in \"old town\"  Chandler.  The meat and cheese plate is pretty good-- certainly one of the best I've had in Phoenix-- but definitely not one of the best I've ever had.  Everyone else really loves the tomato bisque soup, but I don't because of the texture.  The bruschetta was definitely great, and the wine selection is good.  The only real negatives about the place are the following:  1.  The servers didn't come around very often, and the pacing of the delivery of the appetizers to soup to entrees was a little long and a little off.  (We got our soup long after our entrees, which was a little odd.) 2.  It's difficult to get a reservation, and when you do, sometimes you are not seated on time. 3.  Prices are a little high. 4.  The place is quite loud.  All in all, though, I would definitely eat here again, and every person I've eaten with at Vintage 95 loves it.  Just wish they could feel a little more \"organized,\" for lack of a better term.  There are little things that aren't perfect, but the food is pretty good!"}
{"text":"I'll keep it short - go to V95, drink good wine & order the Salmon! Hands down the best salmon dish I've ever taken down - and I do mean taken down - it didn't stand a chance! I reluctantly offered others at the table to try in hopes they would say no before I inhaled this dish!  Great atmosphere - Had a band, I believe it was Vinyl Station ( 2 acoustic guys, 1 w/ a gnar gnar beard) - incredibly talented - and most importantly, they had the sound and volume dialed in. It was ambient instead of overpowering.  I recommend the Rock shrimp & ceviche app, Salmon, poblano entree, carrot cake and the smore's brownie. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"I would like to personally thank Grant and Wheeler for a night but I will never forget.  The service the food and the drinks are certainly worth a stop in, I highly recommend the patio."}
{"text":"Wow!  Really loved this place!  The food, service, atmosphere were all fantastic. We were surprised that they had live music that was just a perfect accompaniment with the roaring fire.  The warm brie appetizer was delicious as well as the duck and pork chop entrees. Will definitely be back -- can't wait to return."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our 3rd anniversary at this fantastic place years ago.   We decided to come back for a great valentines dinner.  When we asked the server about the dishes we remembered so fondly, he said we have had several chefs since then and they change things to their tastes so we don't have those any more.  We should have just left.  I had the salmon and coconut rice.   The fish was nicely cooked and charred but had no flavor and the rice was underdone.  My wife had the beet salad but we found no beets, no feta, and she said it didn't taste good.  I guess the current chef is a fan of my 8th grade cafeteria cook and loves bland microwaved food out of a bulk box.   The highlight of our meal was the cute feral black cat that kept visiting our table on the patio.   Even he wouldn't eat the salmon.....what does that tell you?   The server rocked and the patio was really nice.   They comped our meal but the mgr didn't even bother to come out to speak to us or anyone the entire time we were there.  I think the numerous chefs may not be the issue as much as the mgmt.  such a shame that this place has devolved into what it is now.   Do not waste your time as this is not even a shadow of what it once was.   So disappointing."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good wine, super friendly and entertaining service, chill atmosphere and live music.  I WILL be back :)"}
{"text":"Great service, poor food quality! Have had duck there several times was wonderful! Last night burnt duck hard veggies, and what was that sweet potato bread? Hard grainy and unappetizing. My husband had Ahi tuna his was great"}
{"text":"Amazing!  The cheese and bread with jam were delicious.  Service and ambience were great!  We sat outside because it was so nice out.  GET the bruschetta board!  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Green Chili Pulled Pork sandwich was great, Smoked Tomato Bisque was amazing.  After Siracha closed we Gangplankers have been waiting for something to open up in that space for a while. Now we have Vintage 95.   Decor is really nice... very wine bar-ish. Thick wood tables and chairs and textiles all around and dimly lit old historical looking pendants hanging above the bar. Place feels comfy. Outdoor patio still exists w/ fire pit and umbrellas for the day time. They're working on a side patio too but that's still a ways off from opening as per construction.  Staff was very friendly and all smiles - service was attentive and accurate. Manager/owner came over to see how the food was about mid lunch.  Food... we were in for lunch and 3 of us got the pulled pork with green chili's as mentioned at the beginning and a cup of the smoked tomato bisque w/ what tasted like breaded grilled cheese in it... I'd eat that stuff all day every day if I could.  Pulled pork sandwich tasted really good, bread got a little heavy half way through for me but I ate out the meat and chilis to finish it off. One friend is a vegetarian and got a veggie panini and commented on how good it was and also loved the tomato soup. Another friend had the vintage flatbread, and didn't enjoy it. Was overwhelmed with the pickled onions and candied dates that made it too sweet to eat all of it.  Drink... only went there for lunch so I can't comment on that yet.  Dessert... we didn't order anything but looked at the offerings. We were kind wondering why there was no chocolate on there seeing as we were in a wine bar... there was one with Nutella sauce??? that's kind of not really what we expected but... anyways heads up.  We'll all be back to try other things... and to see what they have for happy hour too. Cheers"}
{"text":"My new favorite place in the valley! The bruschetta was terrific - my favorite was the smoked salmon but the pistachio, date, mascarpone was delicious as well. All 3 of us loved our entrees - extremely creative and the flavored blended incredibly well. Great job chef!!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance here, and the service was outstanding. The waiter kept our beverage glasses full at all times, and even after we paid our bill, he continued to ask us if we wanted refills! I enjoyed the smoked tomato bisque, and this was the BEST tomato bisque I've had in my whole life! I was about to lick the bottom of my bowl. Apparently, the tomatoes are smoked for a while, which gives the dish that \"smoked\" flavor. Wow, I can't wait to come back just for the soup!!! :)"}
{"text":"I think it's awesome that Vintage 95 only serves beers from Arizona breweries - way to support the local team!  When I found this place on my Yelp app, I naturally assumed I'd be getting some wine but I couldn't resist trying the Epicenter from San Tan Brewery, holy mackerel - is this a delicious beer!   To eat - I had the Warm Brie with apricot, hummus, grilled flat bred.  It was an appetizer but it was the perfect size for a quick lunch time bite.  I can't wait to go back and try some other menu items and hopefully try some wines as well  This beautiful gem has my full endorsement and I'll be bringing everyone I know here, well... the well-behaved ones anyway."}
{"text":"My buddy and I were looking for a late night option last night (around 9:30), and stumbled across this place thanks to my handy dandy Yelp app.  We were seated outside, which was lovely, and we got the bruschetta (the one with pancetta and mushrooms was ridic).  Then we got some of their tomato bisque soup, and the Italian flatbread.  I wasn't crazy about the tuna or the salmon options on the bruschetta, but almost everything else was spot on.  Yes, we dunked the flatbread in the soup - and it was ideal.  Great service, great ambiance, and right across the street from Paleta's Betty - which, consequently, has the best popsicle EVER (the orange creamsicle).  All in all, it was a great night and I look forward to going back and trying their entrees!"}
{"text":"Really good dirty martini's - however they are overpriced. Come on people... This is Chandler. They also charge extra for blue cheese stuffed olives. Again... This is Chandler. Let's get over ourselves.  The decor achieves a warm and cozy ambience, however if you look at it a little closer you'll see that it's all a little tacky and almost homely.   As far as downtown Chandler goes, they attract less riff raff however if I didn't live so close I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Very nice! Atmosphere is great. I dined out front: the temperature was perfect on an a mid-October evening. Food was terrific and service by Bobby was attentive and perfectly timed. Risotto balls: yum. Scallops: so good. Warm Brie. And, dessert you ask? Well, yes, thank you! Couldn't resist the Blondie with homemade crackerjacks. Gonna return! You should dine here too."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Vintage 95 twice in the past for dinner and had a decent experience (3 stars). But this last time we went, it was not very good. The food was decent, we ordered the meat and cheese boards and a couple of drinks. For the most part the quality of food meet our expectations. I am only giving Vintage 95 2 stars due to its service. When you eat at a restaurant with this price point and atmosphere you have certain expectations which were not met. Our waiter from what we could tell was either new or inexperienced. He did not have a good understanding of the menu and took 15 min to visit the table after we were seated. He was also setting up for a table of 6 that had reservations next to us. At the end of our dinner we could see that he was waiting on most of the tables in the restaurant. We counted a total of about 8 waiting staff including the bartenders and a manager. We could see out server was overloaded with tables, so we didn't give him a hard time or say anything. Unfortunately the table of 6 that had been seated next to us didn't feel the same. They told the server they were unhappy with the service and \"didn't want to be forgotten\". What really stands out in all of this this is the manager, who spent his whole evening talking to the staff. The staff was well dressed, mostly in black wearing ties, but the manager had his shirt unbuttoned (chest hair) and looked like he came off a night on the town. We did not see him address any of the tables, welcome guests and making sure their needs were met. This is where Vintage 95 failed, you have a waiter that is struggling and a manager that is more concerned with socializing then helping. We will not be going back to this establishment, there are too many other better options in downtown chandler."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Prince - 1999 - Party Like It's 1999)  I was eating when I wrote this Forgive me if it goes astray But when I wrote up this review I could have sworn it was happy day  The place was full of people There was a bottle of vino everywhere Trying to figure what to order You know I didn't even care  They say two cocktails vodka, vodka Party over Oops, just on time So tonight I'm gonna party at Vintage 95   Vintage 95 in the little hot spot of downtown Chandler. I love this location and always enjoy coming to Chandler away from the crazy crowd of Scottsdale.  Vintage 95 is wine bar that serves up some contemporary American style food with local and fresh ingredients. The place itself is beautifully put together; classical mansion style! I came with a date and we started with looking at their drink menu. Vintage 95 has a awesomely constructed wine room with a chandelier to show it off! My dated ordered a cocktail drink while I just shot for the Tempranillo. For out food we started with the Artisan board with aged Gouda, Prosciutto, pickles, salted almonds, bread, grapes, and crostinis with a strawberry jam. Overall, a solid start to my wine; the aged Gouda was solid cheese, but perfect texture to mix with our pickles and cured meat. The strawberry jam was totally fresh and meshed well with our bread and crostini. For our entrees, my date ordered the Flatiron Steak while I went for the Pork Chops. Both protein was cooked to perfection, which we both ordered medium. The brussel sprouts was excellent according to my date whom doesn't really eat brussel sprouts. My pork chops has a perfect sweet bite because of the roasted cherry tomato and lemon mustard cream while the texture was slightly chewy. It came along with an over-easy egg too!  In the end, Vintage 95 is definitely one of my go to spots or my \"ace\" when it comes to places to recommend. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place five stars but everything we ordered was either out or not working so I didn't really get what I wanted. My boyfriend and I wanted to try this place for restaurant week, and I'm not sure if they ended their run early, but we weren't offered the restaurant week specials when we went in Sunday the 24th of May, so we just ordered off the regular menu.  Our waiter was great and super attentive, and the half priced bottle of wine on Sundays was great!  We got the bruschetta and warmed Brie appetizer, we tried to get the pork one but they ran out of that, they were pretty good, I really enjoyed the hummus on the warm Brie platter, the only problem was it was so chilly inside and the fan was blowing right on our food that they Brie hardened up so quickly.  honestly those two plates could have been enough for a dinner itself though, they were both really large and full of food.  We ended up getting two entrees, the sea-bass and the steak, both were really great and my fish was cooked to perfection.  The radicchio was delicious, but I didn't care much for the pomegranate pistachio cous cous it came with.   We skipped dessert and tried to get cappuccino but the cappuccino machine wasn't working, so finished with some coffee.  Overall it was a nice evening out, would probably prefer to sit outside next time instead of inside and hopefully well be able to try everything we come in for next time!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything is great. The tomato bisque is to die for, and the chicken panini is a regular order for me. Their bruchetta is comparable to Postinos, if you've been there, and the other cheese, olive, meat, etc. appetizers are big and delicious. I'd recommend this place over any in Downtown Chandler. It's my favorite! Seating is good inside and outside (huge fire pit is fun for big groups to sit around). I heard the Sunday brunch specials are also really awesome. It's a little pricier, but worth the quality and amount of food you get with each plate."}
{"text":"Completely head-over-heels IN LOVE.  Found them thru Yelp and I was not disappointed. In fact, it was 100% what I was looking for.  I wanted a place to sit down and have a nice long catch-up conversation with a friend while possibly eating just a few shared appetizers, or going the whole hog and having dinner.  I arrived early enough (5:30-ish) to catch the happy hour specials, and stayed long enough to have just about everything on the menu. It would probably be wise to have a reservation for the prime time 6-8-ish hours, as the place filled up fast.  We were sat at the couches in the back which were just fine, even to have a meal. The service was PERFECT.  Our waitress came around often and just at the right time, never interrupting and always ready when we needed something.  Started with a charcuterie board (I'm sure I've spelled that wrong) which could be a small meal.  Kept chatting and eventually wanted more food and drink. Had an amazing green salad, and my friend had the duck entree. Eventually we had to satisfy our sweet tooth.  OMG - please eat the peanut butter creme brulee.  It was magical.  I also tried scotch for the first time (they have several choices) and was most pleased.  It was definitely on the expensive side, but for a nice evening of food, drink and talk, I couldn't have been more satisfied!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner here with my wife, in-laws and sister in law. Everything we had was extraordinary!  Staring with the warm Brie, flavorful and perfectly warmed, soft but not runny; the pork belly with grits was luscious; the assorted meats were complemented wonderfully with dried cherries, pine nuts, olives and pistachios.   The smoked tomato bisque was deliciously smokey and smooth. I don't think that earlier reviewers had the same soup.    The duck breast with cherry mojo was delicious. The duck was succulent and set off perfectly with the mojo, which was both tart and spicy. My wife had the braised ribs, that she said were the best beef she has ever had. My father in law had the portobello mushroom, which he raved about. My mother in law had the grouper, done perfectly moist and flavorful. Finally, my sister in law had the vintage burger, which was just as good as the other yelpers have said.   All of this was complemented by the Klinker Brick \"Old Ghost\" 2009 Zinfandel.   Emily was our server, very attentive, but unobtrusive. Our glasses were never empty and the pauses between courses were perfect. Exemplary service!  We were very well pleased with our visit to Vintage 95. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went here today with my boyfriend for a pre valentine's dinner. I picked this restaurant because of the high ratings and promising photos. I don't know if it was just an off night for our server Michael, but our special night became a night I seriously want to forget.   We had a reservation for 4:45 and requested an intimate table for 2. We arrived around 4:10 and the cheerful hostess seated us at near the fireplace by the wall. There's already a couple of ladies talking about their sons. So much for my request. Nevertheless our server quickly arrived and placed a couple of waters on our table and handed the menus.   I ordered the Lamb Shank and my man ordered the Vintage Burger. Before having that, we asked for cups of their smoked tomato bisque. Soups arrive, tasty, just the right amount for a starter. Then, our server went to our table and apologized that all the dinner entrees can't be served until 5 except the vintage burger. He said he didn't know it as well. Bummer oh well, I ordered some bruchetta first. It was okay. Nothing exceptional. My man's vintage burger looks bomb though. I love the mix of regular potatoes and sweet potatoes. So since I enjoyed that, I wanted to order the burger as well if I can't have any other entrees. alright the server said. Then after a few more minutes he apologized again and said that it's prepping time, it'll be out in 15 more minutes. I said sure I'll wait.   30 minutes passed, I just requested it to be To Go. My hunger passed already and my boyfriend was done with his food. hooray for our valentine's dinner night. Smh. Then when I requested the check, the Lamb Shank that I originally ordered was included in the receipt. So once again I had to call the attention of the server and ask to readjust the bill. Maybe it was Michael's (the server) off night. I too am a server and I get these moments. It's just really disappointing how on our valentine's dinner, I didn't have proper dinner. Oh well. On to the next hunt for a better upscale restaurant."}
{"text":"Let me just paint a picture...  While I love Arizona and have lived here for 17 years it is always great to get away and explore the world.  I have traveled abroad and domestic to some highly populated and not so populated areas.    From the moment you enter the door you have left everything behind.   I lost the identity I am in Arizona.  The ambience is calming and inviting.  I was not sure exactly where I wanted to sit because each place is unique in it's own.    I took a wine flight suggested by our server.  They offer an extensive collection of fine wines.  He suggested proper pairing with their extensive small plates.   I prefer creating a meal of small servings to have the opportunity to discover new things each delicious.  The service is impeccable!  Pricing was very reasonable.   With good company, wine, food and ambience nearly 2 hours had past.  As I got up to leave I was uncertain if this was a place out of downtown London or the hills of Como.  Needless to say I am grateful this is Arizona and has now been a favorite since!  For all of us in Scottsdale, this is worth the drive every time!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was pleasant, the staff were nice. However the food weren't really great. Actually the entrees weren't, the warm brie was pretty tasty.  My husband ordered the sirloin, medium. It came out rare, the manager offered a new one (medium well this time), came out well done. 4 stars are for the brie platter and how nice the staff were."}
{"text":"Visited Vintage for dinner on a Friday night for the first time... Beautiful decor! Absolutely loved the atmosphere! The bruschetta was decent although Ive had better. The bacon one was just horrid but others have liked it so maybe its just me : )The tomato bisque was AWESOME! Prime rib - not bad but not fantastic either, definitely overpriced. The very best part of the entire experience was our server, Richard. He was seriously amazing. He is the only reason they are getting 4 stars, should be a weak 3... I can make just OK food at home for less than $150. I will definitely try it again because I really loved the place and  want to make this work!"}
{"text":"Okay so my fiance and I came here for our 6 year anniversary with a reservation. They sat us at the most awkward table in the whole place  which is this 2 person table located right by the front waiting area and way too close to another table where you have to worry about bumping into the person behind you so we asked to move. I ordered the Ahi Tuna and it tasted terrible to me..the tuna itself was good but everything else did not compliment it at all..I felt like it was just some random things added when you experiment with food but didn't come out as good as you thought it would. I just ate the tuna. I also had the banana tres leches and since I am Mexican I'm going to be terribly picky about this. They definitely had the right idea but the banana flavor tasted generic when it would've been better if it tasted more like real bananas. Other than the food this place had really good service and a nice atmosphere but if it wasn't for those two things Vintage 95 would have got 2 stars for overpriced not so great tasting food."}
{"text":"Love this place! the food is good, but the atmosphere is really why I go here. They have a great selection of bruschetta, as well as other tasty dishes."}
{"text":"Very nice for a date out.  It's a little pricey but the food is excellent.  It's nice to get a really good steak these days.  The ambiance is really nice.  When I was able to drink wine... the options were varied and had a great time!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me!!  This was the worst place ever!  Service was terrible... had to ask and wait forever for water ..the tomatoe bisque tasted like eating a salt shaker...ordered the sea bass it was so fishy and salty I could hardly eat it. The barley was undercooked to the point it was crunchy.   The wine glass was greasy and had fingerprints in it..   the only positive thing was the atmosphere,  so disappointed that it was such a horrible experience.   Went here to try something new during restaurant week.   I will NEVER come back!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time tonight. Let me bring the hi lights in the beginning for your ease. The decor was beautiful! Very cozy and completely inviting. Also our server was fantastic!  Now on to my issue with this place: my god this place is expensive! I've been to multiple wine bars and my goodness this place is more pricy than most. Also they only had one Riesling for the pay by the glass section and it was $9 when I can get the bottle for $13 at world market. Small selection and overpriced, will not be back."}
{"text":"Came here for Happy Hour on a Sunday with the boyfriend. We decided to sit out in the patio to enjoy the good weather. We both ordered the $5 crafted cocktails, which were good for its price.  We also decided to get some snacks, so went with the Piri Piri Fries and the Arancini.  The Piri Piri fries had a spicy taste to it, which we both liked.  The Arancini was really good especially with the sauce around it.  Really enjoyed the happy hour.  Would like to come here again in the future."}
{"text":"Great wine.  There was nothing overly bad about it, but i also didn't love it.  Expected a bit more for the prices.  I also will avoid the bruschetta in the future.  The bread was too thick and drowned out the flavor of the toppings.  I did really like the steak however, I will definitely get that if we go back again.  Seems like a good place for happy hour, however, for the price i think you can find a better spot for dinner."}
{"text":"It's a pretty neat place that tried really hard to deliver a unique experience. The food was above average and the wine selection was excellent. They could have offered a few more beers but that's ok. The only real set back for us was where we sat...right next to the hostess stand where we got to hear all about one of the girls flat chest and how she wished she had bigger...um...you know. Then the other hostess got to make out with her boyfriend when he showed up. That was special. So, if we could have moved away from that it would probably get 4 maybe even 5 stars for us."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great wine selection, great food, and great service.  Try the filet.  Phenomenal!  Highly recommend!  While we waited for our food for a long long time, we talked to the owner and he comped our stakes. Good place!"}
{"text":"This place is cool, nice, interesting and godly over priced.  I loved the rock shrimp. Those were probably the only thing on the menu thats worth the money.  The wine selection isnt bad.  My bf got pretty friendly with the bar tender and thought for some reason that the bartender would have given him a deal.  But definitely not the case.  I dont mind paying for expensive nights out and such, I just dont feel this place was completely worth it. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"We went to this amazing Wine Bistro on Jane's  Birthday....and had an memorable experience. The wine selection and wine room is impressive, and at some reasonable prices.  The menu has something for everyone.  I had the remark-able hamburger, and it was one of the best I've had...but, they also have delicious soups and appetizers.  The bruscetta is five star! We've spoken with the owner Gavin, who used to be the chef at House of Tricks in Tempe, and you can see the pride he has in his place.  Friday and Saturday nights are always packed, but they take reservations.  Check out the back patio....big space, but very intimate settings with fire pit, outside bar, and lots of heaters.  The inside is charming.  Comfortable chairs...and lots of seating around the fireplace.  The Bar has a lot of character with the backdrop being the 100 year old brick wall from the old Chandler Post Office.  Once you go, you'll continue to go back...it's that good.  Congratulations, you've got a winner!"}
{"text":"Brace yourself - there is absolutely nothing about Vintage 95 that isn't awesome...  Food - cool, trendy, delicious Service - friendly, professional Drinks - cool, trendy, yummy Atmosphere - warm, inviting, festive  Love this place for romantic dinner, happy hour with friends or after dinner drinks, dessert and music....sooo gla d we have this place in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Wonderful afternoon on the patio. The team was so accommodating to our group- even offering separate checks! Our food was delicious. everyone sampled each others and there was only yummmmm heard."}
{"text":"I was excited to visit Vintage 95 because I've heard of this place before and I was in the area. When we got to downtown chandler, it was a zoo - I had no idea there was an artwalk, but I didn't want that to deter me from eating at this establishment.    So we scored a parking spot relatively quickly - however, the wait to get a table was 45 minutes.  I hate waiting.... you had the option to eat appetizers (excluding entrees) at the front patio until a table was ready so we decided on that since I was starving. A perk is that they turned on the heater so we wouldn't freeze to death. Inside the restaurant is very charming, cute, rustic, and romantic. It would be a nice place to take a date, for sure.    Our order:  the popular bruschetta board - 1) Pistachio, Date and Marscarpone 2) Salami, Olive Pesto and Feta Mousse 3) Shreiner's Bacon Jam and Whipped Goat Cheese 4) Prosciutto, House Made Ricotta and Fig Honey and the Vintage flatbread - Fennel Goat Cheese, Prosciutto, Onion Jam and Arugula  Just reading these ingredients made my mouth salivate - pesto, proscuitto, ricotta, goat cheese, pistachio, dates...mmmmmm.... right?!  We got our order and I was not impressed at all!  The flatbread was underwhelming and the bruschetta was ok - the bread was a little chewy.  After about 40 minutes or so, the hostess tells us that a table is ready, but we were already getting full and if the entrees were anything like the last two items we ordered, we decided to not take the chance. So we got our check and checked out the booths at the artwalk."}
{"text":"Excellent wine selection, atmosphere, and the cheese board/salad I had were both lovely."}
{"text":"First time here this evening and overall very pleased with my experience!  Negatives: - icy initial reception by hostess. She was not friendly. - no happy hour food items - I wasn't a fan of their white blend  Positives: - great service. He was friendly, quick, and attentive.  - loved the atmosphere. Warm, cozy, visually appealing - the whole place is beautiful! - FOOD IS AMAZING! We had the bruschetta sampler, smoked tomato bisque with grilled cheese croutons (genius), mixed fries, and pear salad. Everything was beautifully presented and delicious! Fantastic!  We only had time for one glass of wine. I will definitely be back to try more! Great place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I met 2 friends for dinner at this restaurant and had a great time. The food, drinks and atmosphere made for a really fun evening."}
{"text":"Vintage 95 delivers a great wine list with helpful but unobtrusive service. We shared the pear salad and green chili pulled pork sandwich and both were generous and delicious with flavorings just right--enough spice to be interesting but not too hot.  Their outdoor patio is beautiful and comfy. This is a great place to relax and enjoy downtown Chandler--great food, wine and friendly staff--beautiful setting in a historic building."}
{"text":"Amazing food, girlfriend got a chardonnay that was amazing. Only giving it 3 stars though cause our server was super slow when it was dead inside."}
{"text":"In our continuing quest to identify cool, locally owned places to eat and/or drink, Caroline and I auditioned Vintage 95 last night.   Before I go further, understand that whenever I go out for eats or drinks, I have  in  mind a Platonic Ideal of the Bar/Pub/Eatery I most want to frequent. I'm on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life.   Vintage 95 isn't quite there, but it's damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, you'll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...  The plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.  The location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]  The atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.  Caroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal \"vodka martini extra dirty extra cold\" which she judged to have \"perfect dirtiness\", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold.   The limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious.   Things being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us \"you have to try the Vintage burger\", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.  In for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.  Like everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.  At this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.  We will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too."}
{"text":"So, I went here with my best friend- we both love wine. They have happy hour from 3p-6p daily, so we figured we'd give it a shot. The environment is nice- could be a great date night place given the lights are dimmed and the setting seems kinda romantic. Their HH menu isn't too extensive when it comes to the wine. They had 3 white & 3 red options for HH which was $5 per glass or $20 per bottle. I ordered a Cabarnet, which was good.   Our server was new, so we didn't have high expectations (not meaning that to sound rude but you know how it goes with newbies :P). He was nice but kind of awkward; he tried to upsell a few times, which became frustrating given we told him we were only interested in the HH specials. We ordered the fries-which were delicious and the bruschetta, which was just okay. Honestly, the only wine place I've experienced is Postino and I would choose them over this place any day. I think Vintage is more suitable for those looking to spend a lot more money & to have that expensive style meal. Just from the menu, everything was highly priced and from watching other orders come out, seemed to not coincide with the portions given. I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Met a date on my first visit here this evening. The staff is on spot, food variety, flavor, and cost all in alignment. The atmosphere was relaxing with a touch of upscale. Nice acoustic singer to top off the evening. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great attention by the bar staff, cozy atmosphere with some wine by the fireplace.  Enjoyed our meal, but did not enjoy watching two wait staff downing a fifth in the \"secluded\" wait staff bar area between bar calls.  The charm of the place with the acoustic music made for an overall pleasant night.  Ignore the cheesy led candle lights."}
{"text":"I was so excited that downtown Chandler finally had a wine lounge and had high expectations of this establishment based on what I had heard.  The new owners have completely transformed this former restaurant into a very comfortable and inviting wine lounge.  There is just the right mixture of tables, bar seating and comfy chairs and couches arranged into nice seating areas.  The fireplace adds a nice touch .. and that's just the inside. The outdoor patio is just as nice and with the heaters you can enjoy it year round.  I've only tried the cheese boards here, the selection of cheese is very good (you get to pick 3 out of about 9) and the presentation is nice.  The only thing that is holding me back from a better rating is the red wine selection.  Since I don't drink white I can't comment on the whites.   I've also found the servers' knoweldge about the wine really varies.  Fortunately they will give you a taste if you ask for it.    I will continue to come here especially if I want a chill evening with great live music with Sarah but this isn't your \"go to\" place to try new and interesting wine or learn more about wines."}
{"text":"This place has a great staff and consistently good food. We really enjoy dining on the patio out back."}
{"text":"I loved it here. I went here on a  date and the atmosphere was perfect and romantic. We had some bruschetta and I also ordered a salad. The wine and the bruschetta were great. Lots of options!  I definitely recommend this place for a date night."}
{"text":"Vintage 95 is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Chandler, and a really great date spot! From the cozy ambiance, to the service, to the food, everything is great! I've tried the beef tenderloin and the sweet potato gnocchi, and both were absolutely delicious.   And to top it off, when I was about 50% finished with my gnocchi, the server came over and mentioned that the sauce didn't look quite right. Although I told her it was delicious, and I proceeded to eat almost the entire dish, she came out with a completely new dish in a to go box for me to try later. Both were amazing, but I really appreciated her making sure I got the full experience and it was fully up to their standards.   Overall, a great little restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times over the past few years and decided to come here one more time before leaving for Colorado.   Best decision I made with respect to food! There is a new menu and it was amazing! The group I was with had lamb, burger, duck, calamari, pork belly and a salad. All of it was completely amazing! I may have taken from everyone   The service was good not a long wait and wine selection seems to be better than most.   Prefect place for a date night, group event or just a beer because they have a nice bar area.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp review. Pretty empty on a Monday evening. Environment was good. Service was friendly. However, my choice of Sea Bass was \"sold out\". Sold Out at 7 pm? Settled for duck. It was ok but size was small, and not much else like veggie to support the taste besides a few pieces of potatoes. A bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Thai steak, ribeye, beef tenderloin are incredible. Wine was good. Bruschetta was fair. Brie was very good. Happy hour Wednesday: $5 glass of good wine, live music."}
{"text":"You're experience here will vary greatly depending on what you order. Even though the atmosphere says \"drinks and tapas\" the bigger, heartier meals on the menu are where Vintage 95 really hits the spot.   My suggestion? Pork Belly  Next Suggestion? Pork Belly!  Out of pork belly? Bruscetta, but come back next time for the Pork Belly.   PS - Kudos to whoever made the music playlist."}
{"text":"My wife and I do a weekly date night and after reading the reviews decided to give vintage 95 a shot. We arrived and really liked the ambiance and decor. We each started with a glass of wine which we really enjoyed- from there they gained no more stares...  I'm not a food snob and I'm not very picky. I do expect for the price to reflect the quality of food and service. Unfortunately it didn't. The servers were not rude, but the were complacent and disengaged. The best food we had was our french fries.  I ordered the daily special which was a soft crab sandwich and my wife ordered the Ahi Tuna. After one bite of the Tuna we had to send it back. Again, we aren't very picky people but the Tuna was 25 dollars and it tasted so fishy, it was so strong that the noodles it was rested upon smelled and tasted fishy. Meanwhile I struggled my way through the soft crab sandwich, but I now wish I didn't as it is not sitting well. My wife ordered a burger to replace the Ahi, but it came out bland and with ingredients that weren't fresh. $14 is a lot for a burger and there are places in the valley that I think it is worth it - Deluxe burgers and Lush burgers being good examples...this burger was not worth it.  All in all my guess is that this is a great place to have a drink and get some cheese or bruscetta- but beyond that it goes downhill fast. If you want the ambiance with a similar lounge feel but a much better quality of food go to Postinos."}
{"text":"I have never tasted food the way Vintage 95 makes it. My boyfriend and I come at least once every other month, for the price reason. We know the price is worth it. Every bite is worth the price of this food. Best restaurant for Downtown Chandler by far. Take it from me and order the scallops off appetizers. You will not regret it. Promise."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, selection from food to wine, service and the owners are AMAZING!  The bartender Jason was amazing in painting a picture for the food I was ordering and describing the varietal and origins of the wine I looking to select.  I will be bring more peeps to the loungy area during the cooler months because their patio is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Vintage 95 is very well decorated wine bar, with one of the most beautiful wine cellar I have ever seen. They have an enormous wine list, ranging from $40 to $3000 the bottle. They used to have a very good Côtes du Rhône; however it seems that it is not on the menu anymore. Last time we went there, we tried the Rose that is on their \"Wine by the Glass\" list; it was very nice. Their bruschettas are quite good however they could get better bread, I feel like the bread could be grilled a little bit. Regarding the main courses, I've only had dinner there once and I was not satisfied. So I prefer to order the bruschettas and the warm brie appetizers which are very nice.  This place is actually quite special to me because this is where my husband asked me to marry him, lots of wonderful memories there."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service here are amazing! This is definitely a wonderful date night location, especially if you are a wineaux.  The wine list is VERY extensive.  They have something (and then some) for everyone.  And we also really enjoyed the band that was playing during our visit.  The patio looks very inviting for a warm night.  Everything about the atmosphere here is on point!  Now, for the food...unfortunately, the food wasn't as great as everything else.  If I was reviewing the food only, I would be giving 3 stars.  The food was just okay...and we were hungry! The hubby and I decided to share a couple of starters...the pork belly and veggie flatbread.  The menu said that the pork belly was smoked.  I have no idea how that is possible.  There was no smoky flavor whatsoever and the fat wasn't rendered as if it was smoked.  However, the jalapeno grit cake and maple glaze that came with it were great.  The veggie flatbread was also a letdown.  The sauce was extremely sour and just didn't go well with everything else.  So, while I have no problem paying for a good meal, I think our meal was overpriced for what we got."}
{"text":"Had a great time with old and new friends. Veggie Flatbread Pizza was delicious. Beautiful ambiance. Love Arizona."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, wine selection and don't get me started on the food.  You won't be disappointed.  It's prefect for groups or date night. This is my favorite new place....."}
{"text":"Got a last minute reservation for my birthday last weekend. They are small, so I would suggest a reservation. You can sit at the bar, tables, or they have couches that are super comfy and fun to share a bit and drinks with friends. We had the bartender wait on us as we sat in the chairs. Everything was amazing, from the craft cocktails, to the bruschetta, salad, burgers and wine list. I almost went to Postino's - glad I didn't. This place blows them out of the water! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back to Vintage 95 for a date night!  Very romantic atmosphere, lots of comfy furniture, and live music on weekends.  Sarah R. and I tried a glass of the Coto de Hayas from Spain. Believe it was the Tempranillo Cabernet? Memory a little hazy, this was our last stop after a night of drinks.   Would totally order the bottle, though.   Their wine selection is pretty extensive, lots of $5/glass options, and I know within a certain timeframe, you get a charcuterie board if you purchase a bottle.   Full bar for all those that aren't wine lovers.   Throw this one in your back pocket for date night, guys!"}
{"text":"Hmmm.....this is my second visit to Vintage 95 and I was not impressed, in fact, I was a bit shocked at the going's on.  Don't get me wrong, I love the atmosphere in this place, but there has to be more than that.  I'll start by saying that my friends and I were watching a soft-core porn film right behind us.  Boots being unzipped, straddling and lots of tongue were all part of this low budget film.  It was disturbing to be so close to this display by two drunk people (and being unattractive didn't help either).  We brought this up to our waitress who said...\"you should see what goes on on the patio\".  If it's that shocking to the staff, how do you think the patrons feel?  It's not appropriate and it should be put to an end.  The Bacardi tastes like rock gut...I've been drinking Bacardi for a long time and sent back a few drinks on this evening asking the waitress if she was sure he was pouring Bacardi.  She confirmed he was and said that was probably as good as it was going to get - I don't know what's in that Bacardi bottle, but it isn't Bacardi, that's all I know.  My friend had an issue with her Tanqueray & Tonic too, so mixed drinks aren't the way to go here.  Another friend was disappointed in the selection of Zinfandel's.  The food was definitely better the first time we were there, which was right after they opened.  We ordered the Bruschetta and the bread was a bit soggy and there was way too much cheese on each of the 4 different varieties we tried.  I would probably go back, but I wouldn't have mixed drinks and hopefully they can take it down to an \"R\" rating.  The bright spot was the incredibly gorgeous guy that was at the table next to ours with his, uh, wife....who knows what she was because he kept taking his wedding ring on and off.  Oh, lots of fun people watching."}
{"text":"What a darling place!  Wonderful atmosphere and great food. Loved how they put the fresh grilled chicken on the side of the delicious Pear salad to avoid making my lettuce wilt!  Greatly enjoyed the bruschetta appetizer as well!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite place to eat in Chandler. If you are looking for a very good meal, this is the place to take that someone special.  We went on a Friday night around 8pm and sat on the back patio. I started with the cheese tray, had some fantastic cheeses I had never had before.  Then I had a cup of the tomato soup. My biggest mistake, getting a cup and not a bowl. So rich and creamy. was fantastic.  For dinner I had the pork and my wife had the grouper. Both of us were very happy with our choices.   If there was one disappointment it was the chocolate tort we shared for desert. I would not order that again, but the rest of the meal was so fantastic that I almost forgot we even had desert.   Great service too. I could not be happier, will be back."}
{"text":"For a glass of wine and some appetizers in a pleasing atmosphere complete with a fireplace inside, firepits outside, live music some nights and great service... well, you can't beat Vintage 95 in good ol' downtown Chandler. What to wear? Anything your heart desires. While jeans and flip flops on the patio would be fine, you can definitely show up in a sexy dress and heels and not feel out of place in their dining room.   A few tips: + For seating: Romantic, dark and seductive indoor setting. Casual, fun and relaxing outdoor patio. + Live music: Thursday nights are my favorite with Sarah singing and playing guitar inside. She can play anything from Bob Marley to Adele to The Beatles to Rihanna. Her voice is soothing and sweet. Love her! Don't forget to bring tip money! If you do forget, the closest ATM is a few doors down at that crazy Bourbon Jack's. + Sunday brunch: Must try! Delish! All that needs to be said."}
{"text":"Wow. Smoked tomato bisque. The best part are the grilled cheese croutons! I would order the salmon again, so perfect. Great ambiance for a date night or hanging out with a group of friends. Nice outdoor seating as well. Full menu at the bar is nice if traveling alone."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out for drinks and apps.  In the non-summer months they have a great patio as well.  Services is always great and friendly.  The food is really good a bit pricey but great.  I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Oh how do I start this review?!!!!   The restaurant itself (as in decor) is amazing... Cozy and comfy, but that's where it ends!  I walked in for my first time with a friend, and the service from the minute I was \"kind of\" greeted, was uncomfortable! The waiter was clueless about the menu, the so-called hostess was too busy talking and flirting with male waiters and the food was a JOKE! Ok I will say it, it was NASTY, lacked flavor \", was cold, and did I say lacked flavor?! I could be the only one star review because I'm not a lush who drinks my lunch or dinner, but this is not a place to come for any food or appetizer... The chef and the staff need a major makeover."}
{"text":"The evening in short:  Went here for restaurant week on 5/18/15. In summary: overpriced for the food quality, good service but poorly managed, nice decor but tight quarters, inedible short ribs.  Don't waste your time or money, hit up Earnest instead if you're in Chandler.  1 star based on the price to value ratio, the overall experience and how annoyed I was by the end of the meal (would have been a 2.5 or 3 star experience but for the short rib which I explain in detail below).  Service: 4 stars Apps: 3 stars Entree: 0 stars Dessert: 3.5 stars Decor: 3 stars Management: 0 stars  The details if you dare: I went here with my \"ex-lover\" (he requested to be referred to as such for this review) for restaurant week last Monday for the $44 pre fixe menu.  Spoiler alert: majorly disappointing and it wasn't because I was there with my ex.  We had reservations for an early dinner and were seated immediately at the back of the restaurant at a table for two by the wine room in a fairly empty room.  First impression - loved the decor!  It was obvious some care went into the choice of furnishings and end result looks great. The mixture of leather couches and high and low top solid wood tables were gorgeous.  But once we were at the table for a minute and others were seated at surrounding tables it became apparent that they had tried to squeeze too many tables in too small a space.  The servers couldn't maneuver around the guests' chairs and were constantly bumping into each other and the other seated patrons.  Even with the tight quarters they managed to keep our drinks and waters full and stop by at all the right times, kudos to them.   The food portion of the evening started out ok, we got the pork belly and gaspacho soup as appetizers, both of which were decent although the gaspacho was not exactly what I expected (more like blended cold tomato soup with no chunks of veggies in it unlike typical gaspachos, it was still refreshing though).  We both ordered short rib for our main entree.  They took a while to come out which would have been find if it had been edible when it arrived.  When I got mine the meat was so hard I was a bit hesitant (and as it turns out rightly so) to try it.  I pulled apart the first piece with some effort and it was pretty gray inside and looked kind of dry.  I made the mistake of tasting it and wow was it worse than it looked.  It was extremely dry and stringy and tasted off.  Like they had made it the previous week, left it in the fridge uncovered and then heated it up in a super hot oven so whatever was left of the moisture evaporated and left a gray flavorless mess.  It was so bad I had to spit it out, and were you to ask my dining companion he would get a far off look in his eye and tell you with a bit of remorse that I am not a spitter. To add insult to injury the mashed potatoes under the short ribs were cold. The ex's short ribs were better but still not what I would expect from a place this pricey with 4 stars on Yelp.  I ended up sending mine back and they sent out another plate which was better but still not great and certainly not worth either the wait or the portion of the $44 that would have been allotted to cover the main dish.  My companion was done with his by the time my replacement meal came out, so I had a few bites and decided to wait for dessert to see if the meal could be salvaged.  We had the S'mores Chocolate Tarte (probably the best thing of the evening, very rich and very well executed) and the Coconut Tres Leches cake which the ex liked but I thought was meh (not a fan of Tres Leches anyway).  Then the bill showed up.  The server took care to explain that there was an extra charge for the third Short Rib on the check and pointed out that the charge had been removed at the bottom of the check.  I thought he was trying to explain that they had comped all or part of my meal (which I would have expected given how terrible the first short ribs were), but when we looked at the check it was exactly as he had described.  They charged full price for what was essentially half a meal with a ruined main course and \"comped\" the extra $44 that was for the replacement short ribs.  That sealed the deal for both of us, neither of us will be back. I may have been tempted to give it another shot since I like the concept, the location (close to home) and the service but instead the management lost possible repeat customers and earned a 1 star Yelp review by charging full price for a poorly executed, sub par meal."}
{"text":"I came here for a girls night last Thursday with a few friends. We had some wine and food out on the back patio. Unfortunately we arrived too late for Happy Hour.  The $5 a glass is a great deal even though the choices are limited. The even better deal is the free bruschetta board if you order a bottle; we definitely would have taken advantage of that if we had been there an hour earlier.  We were lucky enough to get to listen to the wonderful music of Sarah Vanell who was performing there that evening.  I thought I recognized her voice from Vincitorio's and so I googled it when I got home and sure enough it's the same girl.  She sort of sounds like Jewel but she sings a wide range of songs and puts her own stamp on the covers.  Just an awesome performer.  The bruschetta choices on the menu are pretty much the exact same descriptions as the offerings at Postino but after sampling them I can say that they are not quite the same caliber. The warm brie was good but not as impressive as I thought it would be.  I agree with April Q. that they are pretty skimpy with the bread which is surprising since it is just plain pita and didn't even taste like it was baked there. We also got a veggie flatbread which was a favorite of the girls who had been there before.  That was pretty tasty and I highly recommend it.  The dinner menu was short but there were a few entrees on there that I would like to try in the future.  The other girls shared a couple of bottles of Pinot Grigio that were very reasonable priced.  I, the lone red drinker, had a couple glasses of a really nice GSM blend that I can't remember the name of (their wine list on the website must not be up to date since I don't see it there either).  Our server was absent for a while in the beginning but made it up by being very friendly and attentive the rest of the time we were there.  The main attraction of this place is their patio.  It was really nice sitting out there by the fire pit.  There are trees and lights, and you can choose to either sit at a table and chairs or comfy couches.  I love the fact that you can see the City Hall building, too; it looks so cool at night.  The only thing that took away from the pleasant, relaxing atmosphere was the fact that there were a lot of smokers out there.  I had to take away a star for that."}
{"text":"I'm updating my previous review. In January, I rated Vintage 95 as 2 stars. I've changed my review to 1 star.  Regardless of the bad dinner experience I had on Christmas Eve, Vintage 95 has a great outdoor dining area that is very relaxed. Due to this, I decided that I'd give Vintage another chance with a large party. I wanted to host a 20 person bridal event. I submitted a request via the website to have an event coordinator get in touch with me. 5 days later, I still hadn't received a phone call or email. I decided to send a follow up email to try to get someone to contact me. At 7 pm that evening, the event coordinator finally called. I explained to her that I don't have a budget, and that I wanted my guests to have a beautiful unforgettable lunch. She said that she would send me a proposal right away the next day. 4 days went by, and I still hadn't received a proposal or any other form of communication from the event planner. This was actually pretty surprising to me, since during our phone call she told me at least 5 times that she loves to bring these types of events together and make things memorable.  At this point, I decided that I wasn't going to chase someone around to give them my money. I'd rather spend more money at a different restaurant to ensure that I'm going to be given the customer service I deserve as a patron.   On August 8, I sent a message via Facebook to the restaurant, to explain my disappointment. I STILL haven't heard from a member of management or an owner. I know the message was read, because late the next evening the event planner left me a voicemail. She said that her boss called her to let her know I sent a message the day prior. Her exact words on my voicemail, \"I know the proposal was very late but at least I got it to you today\".......... Really?"}
{"text":"Vintage 95, you sexy young thing....! I stop by for lunch and I'm always thrilled. The lunch selection is perfect. I need to always get back to work and you always get me in and out in the right amount of time but with the just right amount of perfect lunch. Perfect! My lunch of choice is the salad with a cup of the tomato soup. The cheesy croutons are bliss, what culinary genius dreamt those up, I love them! Well, thank you Vintage for being my go to lunch spot, you are just lovely."}
{"text":"Sat outside last Friday night by the fire, inside they had live music. Great atmosphere. Never had a bad glass of red there and Friday was no exception. Sampled a wide assortment of bruschetta and talked for what seemed like hours. 95 is one of the few gems in that square. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the positive reviews. Based on these reviews and a perusal of the menu I booked a table for 6 on a Thursday evening. When we arrived half our party was late but they were kind enough to seat us anyway (that's why this is a two star review). We decided to order some starters while we waited. We were seated minutes after happy hour ended. Other tables had delicious looking fries and the waiter agreed to let us order them despite happy hour having expired. How bad can a fry be before you stop eating it? Very bad. They were limp, greasy and chewy. The warm Brie was a room temperature gelatinous mess. The food was so bad we left, met the rest of our party outside, and ate elsewhere. There is a lot of competition on Boston Street and this place can't keep up."}
{"text":"Nice place in downtown chandler.  I walked here from the hotel i was staying at.  The hotel recommended it and the reviews/photos looked good.  I had a good porter beer, terrific burger with grilled veggies instead of fries, and how could i pass on the smores cake?  I am giving this place  5 stars for the setting, good beer and service, but above all for the delicious burger.  The smores dessert was good, but nothing special.  It was like a dense brownie with a crust and marshmallow fluff topping.  It was good, but a bit too rich.  The burger was juicy and flavorful and came on a perfect bun."}
{"text":"what a great find. We were vacationing in Arizona and had a wine tasting right around the corner. I had just happened to bookmarked this spot on yelp. And spotted it on the way to our wine tasting.  The food was outstanding The bruschetta is a meal in itself. The smoked tomato soup was killer. Had the pork chops also great.  Cool vibe and the band that night was the Vinyl Station so cool I bought a CD..."}
{"text":"First visit last week. Enjoyed a warm evening on the back patio which had some powerful misters. The service was attentive and cocktail happy hour was half price! We enjoyed the amazing burger and a pork chop, and were both very satisfied. Very definitely going back."}
{"text":"Loved the relaxed atmosphere!! We sat at the bar and the service was great!! Food was very good! Definitely will go back!!"}
{"text":"new menu items are excellent, great service, great new Sunday brunch.  Ask about wines not on the list Gavin always has something special stashed away.  Great plave great vibe"}
{"text":"The food was ok and very expensive I didn't think it was worth it. I think this place is more for drinks then the food. I prefer a couple of the other restaurants right around it  more"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in downtown Chandler.    This place is excellent.  It's been featured during Restaurant week a few times and now I can see why.   Great atmosphere, great food, and excellent drink choices.  You can either choose to sit at a table or the lounge sofa area by the fire place. (Great spot come winter).    They have live music on weekends and it fits perfectly with the ambiance. Usually a mix of new age and jazz.    The staff and service was top notch. Extremely friendly, helpful, and eager to offer suggestions.    Another reason why Downtown Chandler is one of my favorite hangout spots.  You can't go wrong bringing a date here or just enjoying some drinks with friends.  Will most definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"Great relaxed atmosphere. Excellent wine selection. Fresh food with variety. Should be visited if you looking for a place to chill with a nice glass of wine and friends.  Also,soon to come, a dinner menu."}
{"text":"We absolutely love the Sunday brunch! As far as ambiance it doesn't get any better, just an awesome neighborhood place. Emily is so knowledgeable and knows the perfect time to check in and refill water. Loved the bacon cheese grits!!!  The pulled pork chilaquiles were fantastic and you can order a tapas size or entree size but the smaller portion was perfect. They have games and you can sit, drink and make it a Sunday fun day and don't forget a sorbet infused mimosa. Also you can linger on the back patio and have a relaxing environment, around the fire if the weather is cool. Live music for brunch. Just a great local place with good food."}
{"text":"I love Vintage 95!  They have great food and I love their wine selection.  I enjoy sitting down and have some wine in the back with the big firepits they have.  On a cool winter nights,  I fun to sit in the back under the stars drinking wine."}
{"text":"A beautiful wine bar who's atmosphere seems more like your best friends living room than a restaurant. I loved the interior, the decor, the seats, the wine cellar, the secluded location, the wine enthusiasts who apparently also knows how to bartend. It was lovely and quite a surprise to find they had a list of bottles for half off on sunday's.   mmm craving wine right about nowwwwwww"}
{"text":"I wish I lived here, because I would come for the Bruschetta at least once a week! Their wine list was very eclectic and Jason the bartender was beyond knowledgable. So glad we stumbled upon this gem, can't wait to come back some day!!"}
{"text":"We were quite disappointed in our experience last night at Vintage 95. When we arrived for our reservation, they led us to an outdoor table directly under misters. It was 7:30 in the evening, the sun was setting, and we were being soaked by the water coming off the mister. We asked to be reseated, and they offered to turn the misters off. We almost left at that point, and after our evening we wish we had.   Our waiter was initially prompt, informative, and gave some solid drink recommendations. We placed our food order, and waited. And waited. And waited. Our salad order took about twenty minutes, maybe even longer. The waiter commented there was a mixup in the kitchen, but they would be right out.   Our meals, two burgers and two steaks, took over an hour to receive. When we finally got them, they were all over cooked (and unevenly cooked). My medium rare burger was partially medium on one side and medium well on the other. The bacon had seen better days for sure. My husband had cold potatoes to go with his steak, as did our friend. The steaks ended up being cut up for the dogs at home, they were so poorly prepared. The service did not continue as it had started, it became lax and we almost had to flag him down a few times to receive our bill.   Clearly we will not be going back. The only part of the night we truly enjoyed was our drinks, and catching up with our friends. Other than that it was pretty dismal."}
{"text":"I have been to Vintage several times and it has always been fantastic.  Great wine selection and food.  Thursday nights they have an acoustic guitarist/singer (she's kind of like Jewel) who is very talented.   Best table for two is back by the glass wall to the wine cellar."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with my most recent visit to Vintage 95. I make it out there every six months or so and always talk it up to friends. Tonight I went with my husband and in-laws. We ordered a carafe of sangria, which as always was top notch. My in-laws ordered bruschetta - they ended up with a ton of untoasted bread with a very thin coat of ricotta and a light topping of good quality tomatoes. Tasty but not bruschetta and definitely not worth $14. My husband and I got the \"artisan board\" with one meat and one cheese. For $13, we got a teeny tiny piece of cheese, four thin slices of not-so-good sopressata, stale bread, 2 crackers, raw unsalted almonds, six grapes, and about half a jar of very oniony cornichons! The food was a huge rip-off, and not at all the quality or quantity we have gotten in the past. The saving grace of the night was the sangria, which I still think is one of the best in the area. But overall, I don't think this place is worth a trip out anymore."}
{"text":"I brought a date here on a Thursday night at about 9PM. I was absolutely blown away by the atmosphere, we sat next to the glass looking into all the wines. There was a band playing, and we were 1 of 2 couples in there that night.   After I got over how great the ambiance was, the food came next. The food was delicious, the service was outstanding and just all around I had a fantastic experience. I was just as impressed with this place as my date was. I will definitely be taking future dates here"}
{"text":"What a great date night. I wanted to go somewhere different and this place was perfect. The décor and atmosphere are unique. The food was unbelievably great. This has become one of my favorite little spots."}
{"text":"Decent food, nice atmosphere,  attentive service.   I liked it,  but didn't love it enough to gush about it.  It's good, and the food was nice.   I can't put my finger on why I just liked it instead of loved it.   It reminds me of Postino's, but I enjoy Postino's more.   Nothing grabbed me to make myself say, \"I can't wait to come back and have ... again!\"  However, it was good. Like when a date is generally good,  and you get asked,  \"how was your date?\" And your reply is, \"She was nice.\""}
{"text":"My spouse found a deal on Groupon and planned a great evening out for us the atmosphere is simply delightful,  the food was beyond delicious the pear salad and pork belly was my favorite dishes of the evening, but we also had some of the best service from our waiter and other servers that worker there. The kicker is on Saturday night they have a live band which just made it that much more romantic and set the tone for one night I will not forget our date night!  This is definitely a must, must check out place for great food and of course the wine!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Vintage 95. If you want to bring your girl/guy to a fancy, romantic place without spending the big bucks, head here. They have tons of wines and a big back patio with comfy furniture and fireplaces. After going to dinner at one of the many restaurants nearby, give to place a shot.  Overall, Vintage is a very romantic place for a glass of wine...without the hefty price tag."}
{"text":"It seems to be a constant challenge to find a bar and restaurant in the east valley that is not only NOT a chain but that also has a great atmosphere, an attentive wait staff, a fabulous wine list, and a unique food selection (without being too out of the ordinary).   Vintage 95 has all of these!  Not to mention how refreshing it was to deal with a hostess, Jocelyn,  that wasn't 16 years old and actually knew what she was doing!  When we were seated our waitress, Emily was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive,  and never rushed us.  The wine list is extensive, however, I think they should add more low range wines in the $25-$35 range to their list.   The warm and cozy decor of the place makes you want to stay and eat and drink for hours.  The outdoor patio in the back has a great fire pit and romantic lighting.  I HIGHLY suggest making a reservation or you could be waiting a long time for a table.  There was a problem with one of our entrees and the manager took care of it immediately.  I look forward to my next visit to Vintage 95."}
{"text":"I was here for a business dinner on Monday night and the restaurant was pretty empty so the staff was super attentive. Perfect atmosphere for good conversation since you don't have to yell over music or other people. I didn't get a chance to look over the wine menu but whatever was brought to our table was delicious.  We started with the Warm Brie, which I still think about two weeks later. Cheesy goodness paired with Apricot Spread, Hummus, Grilled Vegetables and Grilled Flatbread. Great choice for a starter.  For the entree, I got the Poached Salmon with Citrus Risotto. It thought it was just okay. The sun-dried tomatoes were a little too heavy in flavor and it didn't go very well with the citrus risotto, IMO.  Cute place overall. I definitely want to come back to check out their happy hour."}
{"text":"Fresh food. Amazing atmosphere. I just can't keep away. I love love love the ginger peach martini and I think its Josh wine, can't remember but a common guys name cabernet.  ;-) love the live music and great staff. best burger ever!"}
{"text":"Wednesdays from 4PM - Close they have $20 bottles of wine. I highly recommend both the vintage burger and the duck breast!"}
{"text":"I found this place to be overpriced, especially the food. The appetizers we got were not worth the money, especially when it came to the portions.  If I do come back, I'll make sure to eat before I go! But I think this would be a good place to go when the weather is nice, since the back patio looks relaxing. If it weren't for that, I'm not sure I would return."}
{"text":"We were both really excited to try this place, and were thrilled when we saw that there was a groupon available.  We went on a Friday night- it was easy to make reservations that morning, and they called to confirm later in the day.  The couch/chair seating we were given was a little weird, would have been great if we were just doing wine, but the table was small and we had to hunch over to eat dinner.  The live music was great, not too loud at all.   We both started with a tomato bisque with grilled cheese croutons. ( The salads they offered were weird and had way too much crap on them.)  The bisque was really rich and cheesy, neither of us could finish it- but it was good. There were 3 grilled cheese croutons in the soup- but they were super soggy mushy blobs since they were put in rather than on the side.   It only went downhill from there. We ordered the veggie flatbread for our starter.  It tasted like a cheap supreme pizza. It had red peppers, artichokes and mushrooms on it. It was an extremely thin bread/crust. Cracker thin, but soggy so it was hard to eat the pieces fell apart when you would pick them up and all the toppings fell off. It was also burnt, and the sauce they put on it tasted like they warmed up a can of tomato paste on the stove with sugar and oregano. It was awful.   For the entrees I had the salmon- The server said it would be served medium- It was extremely burned- the edges and bottom were black and gross. There were only a few edible bites in the center- but they had to by picked at as to not get the charred bottom in the bite. The salmon had a mild flavor, but no detectable seasonings.  It was served on coconut rice- it was not good. The rice was kind of sweet and mushy, I like the almonds in it for texture- but only had 3 bites- one on its own, one with the salmon, and one with the salmon and mushroom salsa.  The Mushroom salsa was no edible- it was pungent, very sour and vinegary.   My Boyfriend had the Vintage burger- it was a short rib and chuck (? I think) Burger. He usually has a huge appetite- but he did not like it at all, he said it was burned and very dry and he had to choke it down. It was served with mixed fries ( half regular and half sweet potato) He ate some of them but was not a huge fan. ( He left 3/4 of the fries and 1/3 of the burger.)  Another server came to take our plate- mine was taken really early on and there was very very little eaten from it- she asked if I was finished as she was taking the plate- and walked off with it after I said yes, but before I could say anything else or ask for a replacement-    They had paired the entrees with wine- Salmon came with a Pinot noir, and the burger came with a nebbiolo. Both tasted watered down and thin-but were drinkable. The Pinot was really really sweet- and he Nebbiolo had a really rich nose- but was very flat on the tongue.    The server we had was really friendly, but seemed like he was busy. We didn't like that it seemed like they were all in a rush- and was more of a team effort for getting us our food/drinks/bussing the table.  Overall, we absolutely would not recommend this place to anyone- unless you are going to go for the live entertainment and water- or maybe a mixed drink- we didn't try those so they could be fine as well.  It was really over priced even with the groupon, and the food was just not up to par by any means. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Has a lovely decore and ambiance.  We had questions about wine and we were helped by a wine expert, who nailed what we were looking for on the first try. Food was pretty good, I had the sea bass - I loved the brussel sprouts with it but wished it came with a less heavy barley/gravy type bed under it.  My companion has salmon, which also came on a bed of some sort of heavier side dish.  I would suggest just letting the fish star in the show :) I may stick to appetizers next visit.  The bruchetta choices were unique and tasty.  I'm going back this week with a different friend.  Great place to take out of towners!"}
{"text":"The waitress \"Area\" got mad when asking to fix umbrella. Serious attitude and was slamming stuff around to express to us she was very disappointed to have to move 3 umbrellas. Sorry lady, its a table of 12!  The prices here are quite high. The drinks are good but seriously I don't see how $9 happy hour drinks are such a hot deal.   The atmosphere is nice here. That's a plus. The service has just left us a bit flat the 2x we have been here. It helps to go with good company so it doesn't really bother you too much."}
{"text":"I've mostly been here for just drinks, and some appetizers.  I tend to sit in the back patio where there is a cute little atmosphere.  A note though, for the owners, why aren't there little twinkly lights on the trees?  It would make it so much easier to see!  I'm a young person, but I even felt it was a bit too dark.    So, the wine, can't go wrong.  There is a nice selection and somewhat affordable.    Food... The warm brie is so devilish.  You can't really screw up warmed brie, and that's the problem.  I have to avoid it because I'll just eat all of it myself and it's not the healthiest.  lol The house soup is also a favorite.  Grilled Cheese croutons.  That's the only reason to buy it.   The bruschetta was bruschetta.  Large protions, but also average.  Nothing overly creative in regards to the toppings.  It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't go here for the bruschetta.    It is a nice place to get a drink with friends in downtown chandler.  Quiet, which lends itself to conversation.  Wine and conversation ... that is why I go here."}
{"text":"This place is cozy & nice. Atmosphere is good for date or gathering of friends. Our server was very nice in offering suggestions & being patient while we talked before ordering. She was good with water refills, checking on us after we received our food several times to ensure we were satisfied.   The food was good. Tried the salmon based on sever's suggestion. It had a delicious sauce. Our drinks were also very good, a moscato that had a very nice honey / apricot aftertaste.   Because it is cozy you may notice other tables conversations competing with yours, but it wasn't so loud I couldn't hear. All in all a great dinner."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit to Vintage 95 on a Thursday night..this place is lovely and feels more like a date night with your honey.  In my opinion the restaurant is a classy and cozy addition to DT chandler.   My husbster ordered burger and I ordered the grouper. We loved our entrees and I sampled the fries and they were excellent. I had a jammy, balanced red wine and Mr h had the epicenter beer. We normally don't order dessert but we decided to share a dessert...a fancy apple pie with vanilla gelato.  I don't plan on going here too often because the food is too delicious and will make me fat..I might return just for a drink and share a appetizer.  It's a litte on the pricier side but worth it if your treating yourself out."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour! $5 dollar craft cocktails and $3 drafts. Bruschetta was good, the pistachio date one was amazing. Vintage burger was good, but a little burnt on this trip. Waiters were friendly and the atmosphere was nice. The back patio was perfect for an Arizona winter."}
{"text":"I feel in love last night. Yes, the wine could have had some impact on my emotions but nonetheless this place is nothing short of awesome. Surprised my lover boy and took him on a date to this very romantic and sophisticated establishment and from the big comfy couches and chairs, to the bruschetta and cheese tasting washed down by delicious wine undoubtedly served up a very good time. After eating, we enjoyed our drinks outside sitting on the fire pit listening to music and canoodling like we were teenagers... sigh.... I could go on but you're not here to read about my mushy moments now are you? No, you're not but you now have read about a place that you MUST go check out... just go.. shhhhh you don't need to say anything just get up and go....and have a wineederfuulll time."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Food was excellent the old-fashioned is on the better ones I've ever had"}
{"text":"Very cute wine bar in Chandler. I visited over thanksgiving and despite being a chilly night, they accommodated our request to sit outside by the fire.  Very extensive wine list at a variety of price points. They also have a happy hour special where when you buy a bottle of wine, you can get a Bruschetta platter at half off.  Service is great, they actually honored the aforementioned deal when it wasn't happy hour for us!  We tried the following between the 3 of us;  Bruschetta platter Pistachio, Date and Marscarpone - this was my fav of all of them Housemade Mozzarella, Heirloom Cherry Tomato and Basil Vinaigrette - very good balance, lots of tomatoes  Beeler's Bacon Jam and Whipped Goat Cheese - odd but delicious, more like pulled pork than jam Housemade Salmon Rillette, Cucumber and Dill Cream Cheese - not a huge fan of salmon but this was nicely prepared  Chicken vintage board - best way to think of this is sort of an unassembled fajita that you can prepare - I said fajita which implies mexican, but it's paired with piri piri sauce which is Portuguese, and naan bread which is indian... so it's kind of multi-cultural? Delicious regardless.    If I'm back in Chandler, I'd definitely visit again. Excellent date spot!"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband recently for my birthday. Chose this place based on Yelp reviews since we live an hour away and weren't familiar with the area. We decided to come at 5pm, in the middle of what I read was their happy hour. It was a Sunday and it certainly wasn't crowded. There were maybe 2 other tables when we were seated.   It's a nice place. A little smaller than I expected from pictures on Yelp, but that's not a bad thing. My husband and I both got drinks. He got a beer and I got \"Ginger is a Peach\", which was good.   We decided on the bruschetta board. Of the four we tried, our favorites were the tomato and the salmon. Our least favorite was the fig/pistachio one. It just tasted too much like a dessert. It was the only one neither of us volunteered to finish.   My husband ordered the New York steak and I ordered the duck. We both really enjoyed our entrees. I guess word that it was my birthday got out, because out came a dessert...it was like a s'more in fudge form. I expected it to be warm, but the fudgey part was actually cool. Not sure if it was supposed to be or not. I'd seen pictures of other desserts on Yelp even though there was no dessert menu that I saw and I would have likes to try something else, but the s'more thing was pretty good.   Overall, it was a good experience. Our server seemed a little over expectant...always looking at us like we were being too slow even though that wasn't the case, while at the same time stopping to chat with another table like old buddies. But it didn't bother us much. The prices are a bit high, I feel, but the food is good."}
{"text":"My mom and I had a pleasant lunch date here yesterday! They offer a lunch special that includes a choose two option of a half sandwich, cup of soup, or salad. I had the Reuben and the tomato bisque. Both were delicious. My mom enjoyed the turkey panini. She ordered a patron margarita and I had the ginger's a peach. Excellent drinks, especially mine! It was different and very refreshing to sip while out on their patio. HOWEVER, I have two complaints. First, the amount of flies is disturbing and very disgusting. It was not just one or two flies... It was honestly really gross. Perhaps because the patio is right next to the trash cans behind the restaurants? Meh. Another complaint: my mom's margarita was $15. She got two, which means we paid $30 for two margaritas. Lol. I feel like that price tag was a little ridiculous. If the fly swarms diminish and the margarita price becomes reasonable, I could boost this place to 4 stars easily. I will be back, but maybe not to the patio or to enjoy a margarita."}
{"text":"We went to a wine makers dinner here and the food was amazing!  You could taste the effort that was put into pairing the wines with the food.  Delicious and innovative.  Great spot to hangout with your friends too.  Very cozy atmosphere.  Going back to sit on the back patio when it is cool enough for the fireplaces!  Huge wine list!  Love this place"}
{"text":"I came here with the family for my Gram's birthday. Overall, it was just ok, especially for the price. I had their drink that had ginger and peach, was actually very good, but expensive. The husband had a manhattan and liked it very much. My step mom and I split the gnocchi and the bruschetta and I had the tomato bisque with croutons. The tomato bisque was very tasty, smokey, I would get it again. The bruschetta was ok... the prosciutto was a little on the thick side. The bacon jam was very tasty. The gnocchi, on the other hand, was not so good...very dry and lacking flavor. It was nice that they split it into two bowls for us. The husband had the burger and liked it very much, I thought it was good, but not a 16$ burger. Overall, this place would be fine if their prices were lower, but I guess that's what you get for being a semi cool restaurant in Chandler."}
{"text":"This has definitely become one of my favorite spots for an evening of wine!   I've been here a few times and have loved it ever since the first day. There are so many great things about this place. I love the atmosphere and the way the place is set up. When you walk in you can grab a table or sit by the cozy little fireplace that they have. I love their outdoor patio. It's big and they have two fire pits outside to sit by. Another plus is they also have live music there every night I believe.   As far as the food and drinks. I love me some Pinot Noir so I always order the Ramsay which is delicious. For food I've tried a majority of their bruschetta which is really good and have also had their Italian flatbread. They also have a happy hour everyday from 3-6  which I haven't been able to take advantage of yet. Their staff is also really great. Everyone is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and they really take care of you.   All in all, it's such a great place to hang out with some friends for some amazing wine or also the perfect date spot. Take your ladies here fellas! They won't be disappointed. =P"}
{"text":"Service is excellent. Food is good. Presentation could be more elegant, however, for price point and some gorgeous sunsets this spot is a gem.   Come with friends, come with significant other, whom every enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great service, food was definitely delicious (Recommend the Burger). Live music on the weekends which makes it a long wait for a table but certainly worth it."}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices! My gf and I purchased a bottle of Malbec and the Bruschetta (which included four pieces). Our total came to $28, which is quite the bargain. The Bruschetta was not too hard--I hate when it's overly crispy--and we enjoyed the wine.   Our waiter was super knowledgeable about the wines and friendly overall. We sat on the patio but the interior was nicely decorated and looked cozy.   My only complaints: Snooty hostess and limited offering of happy hour food. You can only choose from Bruschetta and charcuterie.  This place seems ideal for a small group or date night.  Cheers."}
{"text":"I love the look and feel of this place. It's nice, elegant and cozy inside but not pretentious. The outdoor patio is perfect! They had a couple wines that are pretty rare and hard to find and compared to other restaurants, the mark up wasn't too bad. The sommelier was a little young in his skills but he knew enough to pair a couple basic dishes with the typical accompanying varietal.  The food was good. We had charcuterie and a couple salads. The Pear is delish! I would have liked to see more options on the dinner menu, especially with the extensive wine list. But the dishes we did have went well."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Great atmosphere, Great food (all the bruschetta is to die for), The wine is pricey but the cheap food makes up for it.  All in all, bombdiggity!!"}
{"text":"We sat on the couches because we didn't have a reservation. Dave, our waiter, was great. We had the bruschetta platter and warmed Brie with apricot jam. Both were fantastic and plenty for two. Next time we will make reservations and sit at a table. However if you do just drop by the couches were great."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  We ordered the pork chop and the burger.  Nothing special to rave about on either.  The big sticking point was the time it took to arrive.  Given that the staff far out numbered the customers in the place I still can't figure out why it took waaayyyy more than 30 minutes for our food to arrive.  Moreover, when it did arrive the mashed potatoes served with the pork chop were mostly cool (not cold, not warm, certainly not hot).  They had some bottles of wine half price so that was nice.  I'll probably give it another shot but I'm clearly missing something that everyone else seems to see."}
{"text":"We came here wanting to try out a restaurant in downtown Chandler. When we got to the front desk, hostesses asked us if we had made a reservation. Since it was a spur at the moment thing, we did not have one. They told us that even though there were tables that were opened inside the restaurant when we arrived, they were all booked up and offered us to sit in the patio area. We were  getting ready to turn around and they offered us a couch with a huge tables that were shared with two other parties. The waiter was very attentive and certainly knows his menu very well. He offered us many great suggestions and we did end up ordering what he suggested. I ordered a duck and my friend ordered a plate with different variety of meats, cheese and bruschetta. The duck is very tender and juicy. The portion is perfect for one person. I also love the dishes that my friend ordered since I enjoy small bite dishes.   Other than not feeling very happy to share a huge table with some loud mouth customers (not the restaurant's fault), we had a enjoyable meal. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because we saw 2-3 empty tables on our way out...and these tables were empty when we first walked in. Oh well....another time. I am happy that the hostesses still tried to find a spot for us to sit inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Been here several times and was only disappointed in the guys who took me there on a date.  They have moscow mules in REAL copper mugs!!! 5 stars in the bag, 'nuff said.  The bruschetta. Is. The. Bomb. I lurve the bacon jelly/goat cheese and the date/pistachio/masrcopone ones. The others are simply slightly less awesome. I have enjoyed the duck (ate some off his plate) and the flatbread.   Their drink menu is excellent, lots of unique mixes with quality booze like all the classy ladies like. I don't have a good wine knowledge-base but I hear they have a decent selection, the house cab was yum. Beers are limited for those who like Budweiser or Coors, you will be challenged.  The setup outside is my fave, so much so that I've never sat inside. I like the comfy seats and the toasty fire pits. It's all very cozy and romantic. The tall heaters are nice but most of them look like the need to be euthanized. HELLO OWNERS, those aren't attractive . . . kind of creepy actually.   Alas, still 5-star worthy."}
{"text":"Oh Vintage 95, I am in love with you!   This place is fantastic.  From the modern decor to the eclectic menu options.  I can't say enough about this place.  Did I mention that I like this place?  I went here for a lunch while visiting downtown Chandler.  I have had V95 on my Bookmark for a while.    First, you walk into this establishment and it is a posh modern place of beauty.  This time (Early spring/Late winter) of the year is perfect for going to a place like V95 because they can open all the doors and extend the inside outward.    I enjoyed my bruschetta board very much.  My friend and I both had wonderful glasses of wine."}
