{"text":"If I were rating their pastries alone, I would give 3 stars. The coffee, however, is extremely bitter, lacks flavor and is expensive. Never thought I would say this, but you're better off going to Starbucks; it's both tastier and much cheaper."}
{"text":"A shiny coffee shop in the Tinkham Veale Center, with a wide selection of baked goods.

Iced tea rating: 2/5 stars. Tea was bitter and smoky, not remarkable. (But did not taste like coffee.) $2.50 per 16 oz."}
{"text":"Two stars because their staff was friendly. And very helpful. And refunded the exorbitant amount of money I paid for the worst espresso I have had - even in America - in quite a while.

To back up a smidge, I ordered a double espresso, which cost $4.75, nearly literally double the $2.50 it costs for a single espresso. Let's put this insanity in context: if you go to Starbucks (a place not exactly known for its deals) a double espresso costs $1.95. Go ahead, let that sink in.

Sure the Tink saves you the extra few steps to KSL or crossing Euclid to get to Starbucks. But unless the quality goes up and the price goes, it's worth those extra few steps.

(To be balanced, I should note that there was a reasonable selection of baked goods, fruit, sandwiches, bottle drinks, etc. Honestly I wasn't looking at the prices, but I can't imagine that they will fit my budget.)

Looking forward to seeing how this place develops."}
{"text":"Considering this place is like 10 feet from where I have most of my classes, it's safe to say I'll be here a lot. I haven't had much coffee here, mostly just Iced Chai with coconut milk, so I can't comment on that yet. But the ladies working here have always been friendly and try to do their best at getting people in and out quickly."}
