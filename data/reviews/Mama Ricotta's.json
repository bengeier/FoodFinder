{"text":"Oh My Gosh amazing!!! The Lasagna is to die for, the home made Italian sausage inside is amazing. I will be back again and again every time I come to Charlotte!!! I was here on a Weds night and the bottles of wine were half price, what a deal. My friend had the Chicken parmesan and couldn't say enough how much he enjoyed it, plus it was huge enough for  lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Went here his past weekend and I thought enough about it to write a review. Mama Ricottas is nestled in the corner of a duplex shopping center. At night the ambience is perfect for an intimate adult meeting place. The price point is mid grade, you're not gonna lose your shirt to have a decent meal. Yet a date is gonna know they are not at fizzolis'. I had the chicken Parmesan and a salad and everything was delicious. The atmosphere was nice and it is directly across from a park so you can walk off the bread afterwards. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am new to the area and so I looked up some restaurants in a Charlotte guide book.  Saw the review on Mama Ricotta's and had to give it a try.  To start, we had the tomato and mozzarella appetizer.  WOW!  Simple dish but absolutely amazing.  Not sure what made it taste so fantastic but it might have been the olive oil that it was sitting in.  Then, my mom and I split the family style dish \"Pollo Bianco\".  Again, this meal was very good.  5 chicken breasts smothered in a delicious sauce and mushrooms.  We got the garlic mashed potatoes as a side.  Yum!  I, also, ordered Mama's Mojito which is a bit pricey but delicious, nonetheless.  I would definitely go back.  And since they serve family style, I think this place would be great for big groups.  The family portions are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great service.  Great food!! My favorite Italian in the city!"}
{"text":"Read a ton of great reviews about this place, and since we're new to the Charlotte area, we were in search of an Italian hot spot. It was a real cold night out, so as we walked by we saw the fireplace roaring out on the patio and a nice table for 4 in front of it. When we walked in, we asked the hostess if we could sit there. She said someone was going to clean it off for us and they'd sit us right away. Another group was also being seated at the same time as us and as we approached the area, the other party of four was deciding if they wanted to switch and go snag our table in front of the fire. I said to our hostess \"Oh no, they're gonna take our table we requested!\" and not once did she step in and tell the waitress in front that she was about to sit us there. So yeah, that was kinda frustrating.

Other than that, our waitress Brie was helpful and had an awesome personality that lightened up our mood after the table incident. Drinks were good, although wine by the glass is pretty pricey. Beers were reasonable. I had the chicken and broccoli penne, which was more than enough and I ended up with lots of leftovers. My husband had the rigatoni with meat sauce. Everything was delicious and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is always spot on. The wine selection is always excellent and the food makes you close your eyes and say wow!  Great for any occasion and really fun for a special occasion. Desserts...gotta safe room or just do it anyway."}
{"text":"What an over rated place. This definitely is NOT big city, cool, REAL Italian food.  This is small town, pretentious, over priced, \"They think it is cool but it's not\" food.I came here expecting something special.  It's generic, it's dull, and it's OVER RATED."}
{"text":"This is a wonderfully comfortable place.  That is a good thing.

The portions are bountiful and well-prepared from quality and fresh ingredients.  There is no brilliance or even excellence in the cooking, but that is not what the place strives for.  It is the quintessential neighborhood Italian restaurant, located appropriately enough in a small strip mall just outside of uptown Charlotte.

I have been here many times and never had service that was not friendly and prompt.  I have enjoyed every meal there."}
{"text":"I am really not that easily impressed but Mama Ricotta's is outstanding in just about every way. They make it so easy to love them.

1. It's in a good location. The actual restaurant is cozy but not cramped. The outdoor patio is also nice and sealed in. 

2. The service (especially this one server) I don't know his name but he is the really muscley bald one...Yeah he's my favorite. Everytime my boyfriend and I go there we pray we get him b/c he is delightfully friendly and accomodating. He practically jumps to fill up your water, get you the best dish, seat you in the best lighting, whatever it is that you want he'll get it for you. We really love him. 

3. The food above all is one of the best Italian places in Charlotte. I love their penne a la vodka, calamari, and fish. The nutella pie is a slice of death it's so good!!! It is also alarmingly large...I say eat some there and take it home for later!"}
{"text":"our favorite restaurant in Charlotte for a sit down experience

The only way you could complain is if you go there expecting authentic Italian
I argue this is better.

Goat cheese mascapone is to die for

Vodka penne is amazing 
Portion sizes will make you take home a box. 
Split a meal and can be very economical

I could spend a few pages glorifying this place.
I bet the negative reviews are from people that ordered a dish they would not like at any restaurant, or from people that go during restaurant week when they are slammed"}
{"text":"DINE IN ONLY! I would definitely recommend food here, my husband and I normally order a family sized penne alla vodka there's plenty of food for both of us and we take some home. The other day I ordered the same size for take out, once we got home there was only enough for him to eat I ended up having to make myself something to eat. Totally disappointed, 20 something bucks later and I still had to make my own dinner!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to eat for prom dinner, thats affordable(20-30 bucks a plate) Mama Ricottas it is! I came here for prom dinner and was not disappointed; the service,food and portions, music and homey vibe was great!"}
{"text":"I always want to like Mama Ricotta's more than I actually do, if that makes sense. 

Everyone I know loves it, and sure, it's acceptable and reasonably priced, they can handle larger parties with a little advance notice, and the service is always fast and friendly. 

I just wish the food were more memorable, I think. Standard fare, really, and executed without major flaws (though on some nights, yes, it can be a wee bit saltier than you might wish), but nothing to write home about. 

Sometimes, I'll get this \"let's go to Mama Ricotta's!\" urge. Every time I do, I wonder \"now, why did I want that so badly?\" 

I'm never really able to answer. I guess there's something comforting about mediocrity."}
{"text":"Our experience at Momma Ricotta's today needs to be shared. It's always been one of our favorite restaurants, but noticed a change over the past few months. The service continues to decline, there is a growing lack of attention to details, dirty restrooms (even at 11:30 AM- so this isn't due to them being busy), and the pasta is no longer consistent.  My suggestion is to train your team, hire managers to lead by example, and get the service back to the level that Momma Ricotta's has been known for.  I don't want to get into every little detail, but happy to answer any questions."}
{"text":"Ordered 1 salad and 1 family-sized chicken parm for take-out.  Once I got home and opened up the bag, I noticed there was not pasta with the chicken parm (just 3-4 cheese covered chicken breasts) plus they gave us the wrong salad dressing we requested.  Will definitely not return here if they cannot get a simple order like this correct."}
{"text":"Real deal Italian restaurant. Nothing they do here is not legit. Pizza, pasta,  shrimp & veal dishes all authentic.  NYC good and that is a compliment. Little Italy in Charlotte, it don't grt better than that.  Now that's Italian!"}
{"text":"Wow! THE best Italian food in Charlotte. 
If you have not been you should try.
We go quite often and let me say I have NEVER been disappointed with service or food.

They start with wonderful rolls with oil and crushed red pepper. Delicious - then we usually get the cheese ravioli and chicken penne vodka pasta. 

I would highly recommended you give this place a try if you are looking for Italian!"}
{"text":"This place was so delicious!  I ordered take out and halfway home, I thought I was going to have to pull the car over to start eating.  I ordered the Cannolicchi Pesto di Pomodoro Secco with chicken, which was heavenly. My boyfriend got the Tomato Basil Angel Hair Pasta.  He got it with the optional meatballs -- that made the meal awesome!

We also had the peanut butter pie for dessert.  We weren't able to eat very much of it, since the entree portion sizes were pretty generous, but worth it for sure!

Overall, a great little pasta place!"}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte for the weekend and participated in the Tour de Food event which featured this restaurant. The restaurant was clean, quaint with nice ambience. The food was excellent. They featured the Penne alas vodka and penne chicken and broccoli. If you're in the mood for good Italian cuisine, this place is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Mediocre Italian food. I had a pizza and it was quite bland. The waiter was nice, though."}
{"text":"Mama Ricotta's is a great neighborhood Italian Restaurant.  We often take guests from out of town as the food is great, reasonably priced, and the atmosphere is fun without being too loud.  You can order food family-style but we typically opt for individual dishes.

Try the Tuscan Salad, Penne Alla Vodka, and Nutella pie.  Wood fired pizzas are also very good.  Thursday night they feature a \"date night menu\" which lets you pick an appetizer or salads, two entrees, a dessert to split, and a bottle of wine for $50."}
{"text":"The good here is good but every time we have attended the service has been mediocre at best. We usually sit at the bar of a restaurant because the service is fast and friendly. Not here. There is a strain and tension in the manager, the kitchen and then the bar is seldom serviced. Maybe we should try a table..

Update:  the management staff had contacted me a few times and have been very responsive. I look forward to returning and enjoying their food and service."}
{"text":"Seriously, Mama Ricotta's \"had me\" when they brought the bread to the table. I am in love with it. Soft, warm and it looks like they brush it w/ a little butter and herbs/garlic. Do I sound obsessed? Hope not...Anyway, a few dishes I have tried include:
Penne Alla Vodka
Lasagna
Both these pasta dishes are pretty good. I love them both but every once in a blue moon they can be a little off (dry, salty, etc)
Carrot Cake Cheesecake (for dessert I usually share and pick a bite or two and am over it, that's just me though. For my few bites, I liked it. It could have been a little more room temp, felt like it was pre sliced and taken out the fridge to our table but overall it was good. I liked the combo and it was huge--a must share dish. 

Love their sweet tea too!

Oh and the last time I went I had the BEST server. His name sounded like Lavender but I know it wasn't Lavender. He was friendly, patient and attentive--to the point that he was already filling my glass of sweet tea as soon as I finished my last sip."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.   We all ordered something very different from the menu and all 3 of us loved our meal.   The family style salads are awesome and save room for the Vermont Maple Cheesecake!   LOVE!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Mama Ricotta's for about 5 years and I've never had a bad meal. When we think about where to go for dinner and decide Italian we may go elsewhere 'just to try it' but every meal will compare to Mama's because we love it.. so I guess it's our standard for Italian here in Charlotte. The calamari is always on point and a must order. Penne Alla Vodka and the Penne, Broccoli, and Chicken are always amazing.. tip: order the family size so you are sure to have leftovers! The lasagna and chicken parm are great classics too!"}
{"text":"Had the pasta special last night at Mama's and it was unreal.  Pure breast meat chicken bolognese in a tomato sauce with perfectly cooked rigatoni. Chef Drew hits another home run."}
{"text":"Oh Yeah! My wife brought home some cold pizza from them one day and even That was great! #NoHeatingNecessary I told her I Have to go there ASAP... So of course we did :-) 

The front/side of the restaurant is under construction, but once I enter the restaurant, I forgot all about it. They weren't loud and distracting which is a huge plus. The restaurant is dimly lit and has a romantic ambience, even during lunch. 

First, we had Italian bread brought out to us with a seasoned oil. The bread was light, fluffy, and didn't even need to be dipped in the oil (but of course it was great with it too!)

For an appetizer, we got the eggplant fries. They were heavily fried and extra delicious. The crunch was phenomenal. I haven't had eggplant prepared quite that way before, and it was a surprising treat. 

Next, we shared a chicken sausage (yes they have that!), red onion and spinach pizza with extra sauce (we made our own). The crust has such a satisfying crunch. I usually do not eat all of the crust off of pizza, let me tell you, there was no crust left from my slices! (I didn't even notice until my wife pointed it out!) The chicken sausage was cooked perfectly, and the onions and spinach played a perfect compliment to the sausage. 

The service all around was great and I will definitely go back again. Go Mama Ricotta's!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and really love it.  Definitely try the goat cheese & marscapone (sp?) appetizer - so delicious - I could eat the whole thing by myself.  I've only ever had the penna alla vodka, which is usually top notch.  However, the past couple times I've had it, the sauce seems to have a somewhat glue-like consistency.  Still tasty, but that bothered me.  I've always had great service there and really can't complain.  A fun, great place to go to eat. Very laid back, so if you're interested in a stuffy/trendy restaurant, this won't be it. Definitely solid."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave it a 2 (and not a 1 or 0 star) was because the food was decent - the service, not so much. I went with a group (8 of us) for a colleague's birthday luncheon. We arrived prior to the \"lunch rush\" (around 11:30) and at first, the staff was attentive and we got our drinks right away. I ordered a salad with my entree, which came out with no problems and fairly quickly. 

I cannot say as much for the rest of the meal.It was all downhill from there. We then proceeded to wait for almost 20 minutes for our food, which is no big deal if it is busy, but two things: 1) we arrived and placed our order BEFORE the actual rush started and, 2) we watched as 16 people at various tables around us, who arrived WELL after us, had their food come out and were almost finished eating -  and we still hadn't had ours yet. When we inquired about the food - TWICE - the waitresses (there were two - one was clearly a trainee - who is NOT learning good food service techniques for this establishment) kept explaining that it was \"really busy\" and we were there during the \"rush.\" Finally our food came out, but not before one of us went to speak to the manager. He was apologetic, but then as soon as our colleague walked away, I saw him talk to the two waitresses and all 3 looked at our table and laughed. REALLY?? Is that how you conduct yourself as a manager/owner?? RUDE!! I believe his name is Frank. 

While he apologized, he never offered any kind of compensation, as I would expect when you make a huge mistake and treat your customers rudely - at the VERY least. Not even a, \"I'm so sorry for your bad experience, we will take care of your _________.\" Now, I am not a restaurant manager or owner, but I AM a savvy diner and I do frequent several establishments owned by the same people. When I say frequent, I mean EVERY Friday. I am considering not going back to any restaurant owned by them (Bad Daddy's, Cantina 1511, Paco's Tacos...) because of how rudely we were treated and dismissed. Frank needs to go back to business management and learn how to treat his customers, especially if he would like them to return.

I will not be returning here, if I want mediocre Italian food, I'll go elsewhere. Like one reviewer below mentioned, this is just a step above Olive Garden. I have been to Italy and this food is nowhere near \"authentic.\" If you want real Italian food, do yourself a favor and go to Dolce. You can actually hear them speaking Italian in the kitchen. And I have never had anything less than stellar service there."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Saturday night.   It was crowded but we had no wait. There's outdoor seating on a covered patio as well as indoor.  They serve warm garlic bows and bread with spicy dipping oil.   We had wood oven pizza with fresh mushrooms and Italian sausage.   Server grated fresh parmigiano over the top.   Molto Delicioso!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner with his co-worker and his wife. The atmosphere was cozy and family friendly. The bread was quiet good and our entrees were delicious and arrived on time. The portions were big. They were really good. However, my husband had the Chicken Parmesan with spaghetti. The spaghetti was so dry. Aside from that, it was perfect."}
{"text":"I've eaten here so many times that I have often had dreams about Mama Ricotta and I taking a long walk on the beach.  I have NEVER been disappointed.  The service is phenomenal, the food is fresh and flavorful and after eating Italian food in so many other cities, Mama's is unbelievably cheap and, dare I say it, as \"authentic\" as it comes!

Dinner for two with a pre-dinner cocktail and a moderately priced bottle of wine is only about $100.  Do it .. do it now."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying Mama Ricotta's for many years and went again last night.  Friends that were joining us were late, so I enjoyed a glass of wine and their delicious garlic rolls while we waited.  Never a bad way to start dinner.  Several of us had the garlic potato soup to start and it was terrific.  On Sunday nights apparently they offer rotating specials culled from one of their favorite Italian restaurants as a tribute.  Neat idea.  I had the Pork Saltimbocca special and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I adore this casual and family-friendly restaurant.  Its quality is consistent and they are great for take-out or dine-in.  The Penne ala Vodka and tiramisu are delicious.  All the salads are great and I typically order the chopped or Mama's with a meal.   I also like their optional \"family-size\" portions which are great to share or just to guarantee that you'll have leftovers."}
{"text":"Dinner was just okay for me.  Nothing terrible but nothing great.  I had heard rave reviews about this place and my in-laws were coming into town (who love Italian food) so my husband and I decided to take them to Mama Ricotta's.  Being that it was their 36th anniversary we called ahead to make a reservation and to see if anything special could be placed at the table signifying this event.  We spoke with the manager and spelled out the names of my in-laws and we were told that they would have something put on the table to signify their anniversary (this was after they said they could not print a special menu to say \"Happy Anniversary\").  Anyway, we were feeling good about that and excited to have a little surprise for them.  However, we showed up and there was nothing on the table.  I let my initial disappoint go and continued to be optimistic with the hopes that the food and service would make up for it.  I cannot say that it did.    

We started with the Calamari appetizer, which was pretty good, lightly battered and generally fresh tasting calamari.  The garlic bread tasted like store bought dinner rolls, which just are not for me; however the oil with chili peppers and fresh garlic was a nice touch.  

On to the entrees, I went with the primavera pasta (one of the only options for a non-red sauce or non-cream based pasta dish), which was in a garlic and olive oil sauce, but it just generally lacked flavor.  My father in-law got the chicken Parmesan, and said he enjoyed it, but he only had about 3 bites out of the 2 pieces of chicken that came with it so I think he was just trying to be nice since we were the ones that picked the restaurant.  My mother in-law had a salad (as she is not a huge eater), which was very nice and she thought it was delicious.  My husband's dish I can say was delicious as well, and may have been the saving grace of the entire meal; he went with the Penne Alla Vodka.  This I would recommend if you like spicy vodka sauce.

On to dessert, I had a Sambuca (which came out luke warm - I prefer it to be chilled) and my husband had a port wine, which was reasonably priced.  My mother in-law got the Kahlua cheesecake which was tasty.  However, after expressing to the waiter that we were there celebrating my in-laws 36th anniversary, he still charged us for the dessert.  On any given day, I, in all honesty, could care less but the fact that they brushed off our request about the anniversary in the first place, you would think that the dessert would be comped.  Oh well, we still had a fun night.  If I go back, I think I will try the pizza, as the pasta truly was mediocre."}
{"text":"This place didn't have the authentic taste I was looking for. The atmosphere is nice but the food quality was lacking."}
{"text":"Here's what I sometimes don't like about visiting a restaurant I've been to before for Charlotte Restaurant Week: the food is okay, but I usually end up wishing I'd ordered off of the regular menu. Then my bill would have been about the same or less, I would have gotten what I wanted, and I wouldn't have had to fight for a reservation at the most popular spots. Had I done that at  Mama Ricotta's, I would have ordered the Warm Goat Cheese and Marscapone Dip and Butternut Squash Ravioli or the Cannolicchi Pesto Di Pomodoro Secco.  My taste buds would have been doing the happy dance, because those are my \"go to\" dishes at Mama's, and they never disappoint.

Instead, I had the Mozzarella and Tomatoes Salad, which was good and should have been, because that is a tough dish to turn into a hot mess. I also had Mama's Pesto Pasta, which was on the bland side at the restaurant, but the leftovers were much better the next day after overnight marination. My main course was Veal Milanese Primavera, which was just okay. Judge me if you want, but if veal is on a restaurant menu, I'll generally order it. Like lamb or venison, it is something I'm most likely not going to prepare at home, only because I wouldn't know what to do with it. However, I've sampled quite a bit of veal in restaurants, and this veal was nothing special.

One of my dinner companions actually did order off of the regular menu, and chose the Canneloni Al Forno. It pains me to say this, because I generally like Mama's, but it was not good. I didn't even know this was possible, but it was fairly flavorless except for the aftertaste, which to me was sour. My companion disagreed on the aftertaste, but felt that it was below average in general because it lacked flavor.

Other companions had the Penne Alla Vodka and the Pollo Carciofi, which they enjoyed.

The Nutella Pie, though, was more than large enough to share, and was creamy and full of hazelnut and chocolate delectableness, and frankly was what drew me to restaurant week at Mama Ricotta's. As always, the bread was warm, garlicky carbohydrate joy. Service was amiable, if a bit slow on entrée delivery and water refills. The half-price wine on Monday nights was also a plus. 

Four stars are being given to Mama Ricotta's for their usual fare. For Charlotte Restaurant Week's offerings, I wouldn't be that generous."}
{"text":"Italian is my favorite kind of food, so it's no surprise that I would frequent this place when I was back home. The pasta, bread and chicken are so delicious. My only gripe was that the restaurant got crowded from time to time, but that's to be expected when you're talking about a fine restaurant such as this one."}
{"text":"My husband took me today to celebrate Mothers Day and I really was excited to come only to be ignored the entire time.  Alex the buzz boy was really nice and helped us the entire time. While we found out that Amanda was our server but we only saw her serving 2 other tables ajd came to drop off one of our appetizers for less than 30 seconds.  Never introduced herself and never offered us bread like the table next to us.  We had 2 other gentleman drop off food and dessert and then we were left hanging at the end.  We had to bring our own bill to the front to pay and didnt know who to tip.  We tipped Alex since we never heard from any other waiter/waitress.  We asked to talk to a mgr and the girl seemed ignorant, uninterested and not knowledgeable about customer service because she never really apologized and said everyone tries to help out.  But this was not the same experience I saw at the other 2 tables who got the real customer service all customers deserve while we were ignored and discriminated.
We are not coming again and it is a shame because the food is not bad.  Very dissapointed."}
{"text":"The food here is really incredible.  There were 5 of us and we were all very impressed.  2 of us ordered the cheese ravioli and then the others ordered a variety of dishes including an appetizer and a salad.  The salad was added after we saw one go by our table!   Every dish was superb.  

When we sat down outside we did have an issue with a smell from some sort of trash container.  The waitress noticed it as well and the restaurant did a few things to eliminate the problem...it was pretty bad...but they were quick to fix it and it did not ruin our meal.  We were just more impressed it went away so fast."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner Friday night....per usual.  We have been enjoying Momma''s food since 2004. Special salad of arugula and beets was a nice change from the usual. Also the fish special and the ravioli florentine were delicious!. 
Daniel was our server (again) and makes dinner even more of a pleasure.  He is  both knowledgeable and  personable.
Love what you've done with the interior re-design. 
A definite dining pleasure."}
{"text":"Mama Ricotta's has had a change of either ownership or management.  Perhaps both.  Use to look forward to the bruschetta but sadly the ingredients and preparation have changed . . . NOT FOR THE BETTER.  Sad to see it go.  Also slightly downgrade the salads as well since the cherry tomatoes were not as fresh as I recall them being in the past.  The bread has also changed w/o improvement; instead of being hot and doughy with olive oil its now CRUNCHY/WARMED OVER.  There is less chicken and broccoli with more penne pasta in my favorite meal.  SMH.

Basically diners are being served less but are charged slightly more.  The quality of what's being served certainly has not been maintained either.  I DOWNGRADED all of my favorite restaurants for this reason.  Midweek/weekend lunch is $45 + tip.  Staff remains friendly.  AVERAGE."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times the last 4 years.  Every time I have had a 9 inch Pizza. It's delicious.   I suggest reserving ahead of time on the weekend. The Staff is always nice. The bread and cheesE ravioli were also excellent."}
{"text":"Come
On
People!!!!!!!

This place rocks, it's my top 3 place to
eat in Charlotte why all the 4 grades, it's a total and solid 5.
The food is consistently great, they do
A wonderful job presenting the food, the staff is upbeat, know the menu, fast service.  The chicken  parmesan is amazing, they have all types of spaghetti options. O my gosh! have you tried the Mamatini? That's a martini made out of aged pineapple. Ok, if you don't order the  tiramisu for desert you have missed the best home made treat in the house.
Do I get a free meal for this review
for goodness sakes I'm Italian for
Christ sakes, well not really, but
If I was this would still be a 5.

Try this place you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Mama Ricotta's is a great Italian restaurant! Tonight I had the penne with chicken and broccoli and my boyfriend had a pizza! Everything was very delicious! I would recommend sitting on the patio and enjoy the great Charlotte weather. Ben, our server, was extremely helpful and nice and it was such a pleasure talking with him throughout the evening."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. I took someone who had never been to Mama Ricotta's with hopes of impressing them.  To begin, the bread was not homemade. They were white rolls you buy at the grocery store with seasoning put on top. WHITE ROLLS.  My entree was under cooked and my friends entree was not fresh.Proudly hanging in the restaurant were  awards and reviews of MR from 2008. When I ate at MR long ago, it was top notch, not the same restaurant now. I was embarrassed for Mama Ricotta's."}
{"text":"Mama Ricotta's is one of those places that you come back to time and time again when you have a craving for something flavorful and hearty. 
The portions are plentiful, even at lunch when you can  treat a coworker and still have a tab under $20. Pastas are cooked to perfection and the sauces all have a homemade, multi dimensional flavor profile that leave you mopping your dish with the house made herb rolls that are given when you sit down. 
For dinner service there is a much bigger menu with hearty entrees like beef risotto and chicken with chianti mushroom sauce.
A walk past the pizza station provides a brief glimpse of the kitchen, which was bustling with clanking pans and sounds of dishes being made from scratch. This is always a good sign and you can taste the freshness in all the ingredients. 
Service here is excellent ALMOST every time, but my server last night never even cracked a smile. She had a trainee with her and seemed on edge about it, but I hope that isn't a trait that gets passed down. A friendly smile goes a long way with my wife and I.
Overall, Mama Ricotta's is a great local Italian spot to bring your office for lunch or your family for dinner. Definitely make a reservation, even on week nights because this place fills up fast and for good reason!"}
{"text":"I don't know what took me so long to dine here!!  It was on my radar but I just never made it in until my employer held our Christmas party there.  The tomatoes and basil in the bruschetta were so fresh and tasty.  I can always gauge an Italian restaurant by their Lasagna and I was very pleased with my selection.  I tried a coworkers steak & mushroom over risotto and I've been craving it ever since.  The vanilla bean cheesecake was delightful and I like the fact the slices were large enough to share.  I can't wait to return with my mom!"}
{"text":"Definitely a solid option for an Italian dinner. Had a reservation, but it probably wasn't necessary for an early weekday dinner.

Ordered family style:
Warm goat cheese and marscapone dip - not exceedingly flavorful, good texture, but feel that overall it was a bit restrained
Roasted pepper salad - tasty, with a nice balance of sour and sweet, but was a bit overdressed so that it felt greasy at times
Rigatoni with meat sauce - well-sauced, quite good
Pollo carciofi - good portion size with a light, lemon cream sauce. Only complaint was that the chicken breasts were a bit too thick and therefore felt underseasoned

Place has great service and atmosphere for a family or group dinner and left happy and full."}
{"text":"Food was Amazing. Prices are perfect. Customer service was great. My new favorite restaurant! You should have been there like yesterday."}
{"text":"Love,  Love, Love this place. It is officially my go to when I layover in Charlotte! Since it is nearly always busy, I find myself a seat at the bar and order a nice big glass of wine. Beth has waited in me twice and I thinks she may be one of the nicest people that I have ever met! She knows the menu inside and out and has recommended some outstanding dishes. The first dish she suggested was not on the menu as it was the chef's special. It was a pasta with a braised beef that, I kid you not, was so tender and delicious that I very nearly wept! On my second visit she Nrecommended a chicken dish that reminded me if those Sunday dinners with grandma. You know, when the food is so good and comforting that you just can't push yourself away from the table! Honestly, this is some of the best italian food that I have ever eaten! It compares with some of the meals that I have had in Boston's North End. I almost forgot to mention the Nutella Pie...Oh Dear God ! It is heavenly!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this 3 1/2 stars but halves are not allowed. The food was solid ok atmosphere but nothing I would HAVE to go back to. Pretty good wine list and about 5 super tuscans which is cool."}
{"text":"Decided to take my mother out for her birthday and her immediate suggestion was mama ricotta's and I must say her decision did not disappoint. Our server was Amanda and she was such a sweetheart, very helpful! We both had the Pollo Bianco, chicken wrapped in prosciutto and mozzarella over a bed of garlic mash potatoes (I could eat those things for days), with a vegetable of choice (I had mixed veggies and mom had broccoli- I did not care for veggies) all smothered in a mushroom sauce. DELICIOUSNESS!!! And of course we had to order desert, mom got the tiramisu and I got the apple crisp, both spectacular. But the best part is when \"I went to the bathroom\" but actually was trying to get Amanda, our server, to gather some coworkers to sing my mom happy birthday and a willing young man, Danny, was more than happy too. The two of them really made our night! The service here is great!!! So great that I booked my prom reservations here. The food was great as well! Only downside was no complementary bread, but that's not a big deal overall I would definitely recommend mama ricotta's to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Very cute decor, great service, & the pizza is on point!!! Thin, chewy crust with just right amount of sauce.  We ordered the Joe's special and the sausage was absolutely amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Old south Charlotte standby ... this is just a great option when you want something comfortable ... but not TOO comfortable (meaning you will eat well here).  Short of fine dining, Mama's is right there with Ilios Noche (now that is SOUTH Charlotte) for our favorite pasta options in town.

The management staff changed over within the last year or so, and the new crew seems to have even stepped it up a notch.  This place seems to be humming along at least as well as ever before."}
{"text":"This isn't about a dining experience with Mama's, but rather a review on their catering department \"Plate Perfect Catering\" out of the Mama's Kitchen.....

I hosted an event where I work (hush hush on that topic), and for the first time, used Mama's for the catering. I have been working here for 2 1/2 years, always cater events and this was, by far, the best catering I have ever received!!!

Okay, so the staff was very friendly, professional and timely (# 1), the display looked great and we had zero issues with quantity....those are things I expect out of most catering companies......the biggest thing you worry about is the quality and freshness of catered food. 

You usually think: cold, over-heated, dry....and your usual statement is \"it was good, FOR catering\"

NOT the case this time, it wasn't just good for catering, it was extremely fresh, delicious and good, for consumption. 

The menu: stuffed mushrooms, bacon wrapped scallops, passed shrimp cocktail ( in mini martini glasses, cooked, chilled, snapped to perfection), two types of pastas with a pasta station (nice and hot to order), prime rib carving station (perfectly pink inside),  bbq pork sliders, fresh vegetable display, gourmet cheese platter,spin/art dip, chopped salad and fresh fruit.......

It was ahhh mazing and my client thanked me over and over again and raved about the food (yesssss)

Not to mention, the cost is very reasonable, even with a private chef on site. If you ever need catering for an event, I highly recommend Plate Perfect Catering!"}
{"text":"Went with the office to a holiday luncheon.  At 11:130 the week before Christmas, things were hopping, but thankfully, I had made a reservation, so we zipped right in.  Took a chance on the Turkey Meatloaf with spicy pepper gravy served with garlic mashed potatoes and boy was it the right move!

Soooo delicious, it's a shame it's only available at lunch.  That needs to be on the dinner menu for sure, as it was warm, comofrt food with a surprising twist in the pepper gravy (think pureed red peppers, not the black peppercorn kind!)

Melted cheese on each slice was the crowning glory and it was a hefty double portion.  Ate half, and took the rest home for dinner."}
{"text":"we dined at lunch today and had Jovana as our waitress, she was incredible. she suggested for me to get the penne broccoli and chicken, and it was amazing. she kept our drinks filled, despite how busy she was, and she was funny!!! I definitely recommend this place, the food and service will keep you coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm always surprised how good the food at Mama Ricotta's is.  I've been there twice, and both times I went in thinking \"ugh, this will probably be like a local Olive Garden.\"  Twice I was pleasantly surprised.

Likes:  The last time we went to Mama Ricotta's, I ordered canneloni al forno (stuffed with grilled chicken, spinach, and ricotta) and my boyfriend ordered pasta primavera.  Both were delicious.  

Dislikes:  Slightly pricey for Italian.  Can be a wait for a table on the weekend.

Take it or leave it:  Take it.  Good food and we always have a great time.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Our waiter Peggy was very polite and we enjoyed our food.  I really liked the warm bread."}
{"text":"We were staying overnight in the Charlotte area looking for a casual, Italian restaurant for dinner and chose this place after reading the reviews and we were not disappointed. 

We enjoyed the herb rolls and olive oil that comes complimentary, since we had a late lunch we didn't sample any of the appetizers.  I had the chicken parmesan and my wife had the shrimp scampi with linguine, both were delicious and we would order them again the next time we travel through Charlotte.

The entire staff did an exceptional job taking care of every table, Mama Ricotta's is a great place for an outstanding Italian meal."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 7:30 via OT, which is something I've become addicted to lately. Upon our arrival we were given a coaster/beeper and went to the bar. Our table was ready in less than 10 minutes.

We were sat at the table just outside the kitchen, which is a pretty ideal place to be. Not only could I read the specials (and prices) on the whiteboard in the kitchen, but our server was always around in case we needed to flag her down.

The mascarpone goat cheese appetizer was... \"meh\". I encouraged my husband to order it after reading all the rave reviews here. Here's the thing, I hate the \"mustiness\" of goat cheese. I figured that perhaps the mascarpone cut that flavor, and that everyone was raving over it because it tasted better than I remembered goat cheese tasting. It really didn't. I wasn't thrilled.

My husband got the penne with tomato vodka sauce and some turkey meatballs. I got \"Joe's\" pizza. Both were very good, and even better the next day as leftovers. Frankly, I was sincerely hoping for a butternut squash pasta special but sadly, that was not to be. Probably only comes up in the fall...

We'll be back. This place is every carb-loader's dream. (Heard the table behind me ordering pasta in preparation for the next day's Corporate Cup half marathon, and we went there for my husband to carb load before his long ride... So if you need carbs, go here!)"}
{"text":"For how expensive everything on the menu is, you'd think the food would be worth the money. The rigatoni was a 3 out of 10, the sauce was very plain and when asked to switch the noodles to spaghetti noodles the meal was more like bland spaghetti and ground meat. The carbonara was very salty and tasted similar to ramen noodles with heavy cream. Very dissatisfied with the meal & the price of the food."}
{"text":"The food here is great, the service is friendly but good gracious is it LOUD.  Perhaps I'm used to the old Mama Ricotta's that was much more subdued and intimate, but the noise level in here made holding a dinner conversation very difficult.  That said, the garlic knots are sinfully delicious, the tomato with mozzarella is stellar and the wine list is expansive enough.  We get the penne with chicken and broccoli every time (YUM) and like the standard angel hair pasta as well.  Very excited to come back and try their gluten-free menu next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to eat!!! Service is great! Food is amazing!! Especially the mamas house favorites!! Sangria is served here as well! Bruschetta is deff the best I have had! The only con to this restaurant is come Friday or Saturday night the wait is always long. But other then that mama ricottas is perfect perfect perfect! Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"We have been to Mama Ricotta many times but last night everything was exceptional.   The waitress, Hayley, was one of the most engaging waitreses we've ever had anywhere.  She informed us it was 1/2 off bottle of wine and made a great suggestion for my sister and I - a delicious Italian Pinot Noir.  My husband is not a wine drinker at all but with her info, he ordered a glass of moscato. He enjoyed it so much, he plans on purchasing it for home. We shared a caprese salad and for dinner we ordered two penne a la vodka with shrimp, fettuccine carbonara with shrimp,  and rigatoni with an extra dollop of ricotta. Everything was finger-licking good. The manager thought we had waited a bit long for our entrees so he came to the table and sent us two desserts.  It was completely unexpected but it shows how they value their customers.  I believe Hayley's attention to detail and personal interest made the entire evening a great experience.  She should be recognized by the managers and her co-workers."}
{"text":"I agree with Nicole about the bar staff friendliness.  They are alway so happy to see you!

I stopped by Mama's for dinner last night and ordered some of the goat cheese dip and the spiedini di carne salad.  Great choice.  I was intending to go for a light dinner when I came in but ended up stuffed.  The goat cheese was the primary culprit.  Very savory.  The salad was solid as well.  The steak was delicious and enjoyed the many flavors the rest of the salad contained - full of grapes, tomatoes, olives, cheese.

Very satisfying!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing takeout lunch. I ordered the rigatoni with meat sauce and paid $1.50 for ricotta cheese. Back in my office after quite a long wait I opened the container to find rather mushy pasta and watery sauce: no baked cheese, which it definitely needed. The ricotta was in a plastic cup and must have been all of 1/4 cup. And it was COLD!  Bleah. From now on I will make my own if this is the best I can expect from Mama Ricotta's."}
{"text":"I've been here a ton of times when I lived in Charlotte and it was on my list of places to go once I returned for a visit. The salad and dressing (Mama's Salad with balsamic) is EXCELLENT and the pizzas are on point."}
{"text":"The food here was great...went to another restaurant the day before where I paid 3 times as much, and the food was no were as good as 
mama ricotta's. I will be back ,and very soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Our waitress was attentive and we were probably helped by 7 other people over the course of dinner. Food was delicious and very reasonably priced. Nice atmosphere inside. I would definitely come back! Ignore the construction out front!"}
{"text":"I was here for a business dinner and we had an incredible time, they seated us on the patio which was cozy and warm and private enough that we were able to be a little loud and celebrate without disturbing other diners. The food was excellent (I had the salmon) and the service even better - especially going out the way to accommodate our group seating request! If I lived in the area I would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Mama Ricotta's in a while and decided to go with a friend. I had the roasted vegetable flatbread sandwich and it was delicious! Friend had the lasagna and she said it was great. 

The server was very personable and did a great job. I won't wait very long to go back!"}
{"text":"Mama Ricotta's is one of our failsafe, don't miss Queen City picks, so I'm a bit surprised that I haven't Yelped it yet. Maybe I just assumed everyone else already knows how good it is? 

The warm garlic rolls with olive oil and red pepper flakes are a welcome starter when you're ready to gnaw your arm off. Last night, our server Danny (who was terrific) added a splash of balsamic to the usual mix, which was a nice addition.  The Mama's side salad is always a refreshing lead-in the main, featuring a quality blend of vegetables and olives. I've tried a few of the house dressings, and as the servers often recommend, the sweet (but not *too* sweet) Italian is their best. 

My husband is a diehard fan of the lasagna here, which is a flavor bomb on a plate. Last night, I went for the pasta special - fresh linguine with grouper in a tomato-basil-and-shrimp sauce. Can't say I ever found any shrimp, unless they were disguising themselves as fish, but the sauce was flavorful and fresh, there were plentiful, large chunks of grouper throughout, and the fresh pasta was delightful.

The pizzas here, too, are winners. We especially like Joe's Favorite. Yes, it's full of meaty, greasy goodness, but the house-made sausage is killer. 

We ended last night's anniversary extravaganza by splitting the legendary tiramisu. The stuff is made of clouds, I swear. Sweet, coffee-soaked clouds. Mama Ricotta's is some of the best we've enjoyed.

Whether we have family visiting from out of town, or are celebrating a special occasion - as we did for our anniversary last night - Mama Ricotta's is one of our go-tos for a good meal."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Italian place in Charlotte. Great atmosphere, great food and great staff. Can't recommend Mama Ricotta's enough. This is definitely my go to spot for a great Italian meal."}
{"text":"I went here last night for the first time and I am a huge fan.  The bread and oil they bring out is delicious.  I got the lasagna for my dinner and it was SO SO good.  It was a normal sized portion which is nice - usually restaurants bring out crazy big dishes of lasagna and it's gross.  This might be my favorite lasagna I had at a restaurant - the sauce, cheeses and everything was perfect.  They have a really good menu - lots of options and lots of price ranges which is nice, too.

The service was excellent and there is a lot of seating which is good since they probably get super busy on weekends."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night with sisters and was hoping for some delicious pasta. We ordered white spinach pizza, calamari and chopped salad as our appetizer which were all amazing!  The main course took forever to come out! We waited almost 40 minutes. When our main entrees came out it was a total disappointment. I ordered the carbornara pasta which was soooo salty it tasted like someone threw salt in my
Mouth! My sister Toni ordered the linguine with meat sauce which was also super salty. My other sister and bf ordered cheese ravioli with meat sauce and chicken parm. Both dishes were over cooked... the ravioli was hard and it was not good. We were all hungry so they all ate their dish but I couldn't even eat mine so told
The manager how salty my dish was. He was super nice and offered to remake but by then everyone was done with their dinner and I just didn't feel like waiting longer.  Overall the ambience is great and customer service is great! I would recommend making reservations but def be weary the food is overly salty and you will be waiting a while for your food."}
{"text":"Food was great. Desserts were exceptional. The only negative is the bread sucked. Its a shame it isn't that hard to make a bread that has a taste to it."}
{"text":"Took my wife on a date here and it was more than worth it to drive down from Concord.  The food was excellent and even though it was a busy evening, our server was spot on.  We sat outside where they have a very nice patio.  The prices are reasonable.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"We hosted a client lunch here and it went off without a hitch! Our table was ready on time and the service was very accommodating. All of us enjoyed our apps that were pre-ordered, our lunches, and our desserts. I had a small chopped salad with chicken and it was more than filling. Because I didn't know when I'd be visiting again, I had to try the Nutella Pie. It was so freakin' amazing! I shared it with some others at my table and I still had enough to satisfy my never ending sweet tooth with some left to spare. I'm looking forward to the next time I get to go to NC so I can gorge on that Nutella Pie again!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying I can't WAIT to go here again. My boyfriend brought me here for a relaxed and romantic dinner, and he nailed it. We walked in to a slightly dimmed restaurant with authentic photos decorating the tan walls, beautifully designed red curtains pushed aside and comfortable seating full of chatty families. I loved it. Once we sat down, our waitress, a petite blond lady (whose name I forgot after my delicious sangria) quickly greeted us, got us water, and some of the best bread Ros I've had this year. Good. Ness. I ordered the angel hair pasta with turkey and ricotta meatballs, and my boyfriend got some flat pasta and chicken. The drinks came quickly, and the pasta came quick too. The servicing sizes were generous; my plate was about $13 and I would've easily paid more for it, and was grateful I didn't have to. On top of that, the food was AMAZING. Fresh, authentic and delicious. I might be back next week."}
{"text":"This will be short.  Everything is awesome.  Food, service, atmosphere, everything.  Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I'd give this 6 stars if I could. I went during restaurant week and had such a positive experience. The bottles of wine were discounted so we were able to share some for the table. Overall great wine list with lots of options.
The restaurant week menu was very VERY good. I have dietary restrictions (no pork/red meat). Usually during restaurant week, people don't accommodate requests. However, Mama Ricotta's made that exception and prepared each dish without meat for me. 
Everything I ate ended up with a plate licked clean. So good."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite restaurant for years! I tried this place back in 2012 when I lived in Charlotte and nothing compares to this place. I currently live in Maryland but every time I come visit Charlotte a visit to Mama Ricotta's is a must. If only there could be a Mama Ricotta's in the DC area! The chicken Parmesan and the angel hair pasta with turkey meatballs are excellent."}
{"text":"I have some mixed feelings about Mama Ricotta's, but ultimately I leave the restaurant pretty happy and satisfied every time.

My biggest complaint is that they took the Butternut Squash Ravioli off the menu... WHY??!?! I truly loved this dish!!  The raviolis themselves were plump and yummy, the squash was rich and creamy, and balanced out with walnuts. Who knows why, no one ever wants to give me a straight answer. Apparently a lot of people still request the dish, so occasionally they will stock the ingredients just to randomly prepare it... but still, I would eat here all the time if they kept this!

Instead I've ordered the Penna Alla Vodka (minus the pancetta) and the Ravioli Alla Fiorentina. These are both pretty good and would definitely recommend them, but they're just not the same!!!

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND The Warm Goat Cheese and Marscapone Dip! This stuff is off the chain amazing! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! 

I like the dark, cozy feel of the restaurant with drum shade lighting. Thumbs up to the high ratio of booth seating. Worst thing about the decor here are the ridiculous pasta paintings. Good God, the color schemes on these things are hideous. Someone needs to remove those, ASAP.

Service here has been mixed, 85% of the time waiters have been quick, polite, and right on. But I have had an occasional dud.

The prices here are a little high, expect to spend over $12 a person minimum. The good news is they have coupons in the Charlotte Citipass book! Buy One, Get One baby! 

Expect a wait on the weekends (10-20 minutes at least). Parking is limited for the volume of weekend customers, so expect a hike."}
{"text":"The staff and dessert were exceptional but the food.....not so much. Perhaps it was because of the Mother's Day buffet, but the food did not impress my family. The buffet was $35 per person!! We were so blessed to have the cook make us lasagna for only $11.50 a plate. We chose to have 3 of our family members (including me) to eat at the buffet and the rest to eat lasagna. The buffet included salads, pastas, ravioli, chicken, salmon, bread, shrimp, brunch items, and of course dessert. The penne a la vodka was very good as was the baked ziti. I didn't really like the ravioli but my family did a lot. The dessert were so delicious and petite, they had 3 mousse varieties, cream puffs, eclairs, chocolate chip cookies, sprinkle cookies, and banana muffins. The lemon mousse was my personal favorite as well as the cream puffs. My family really did enjoy the desserts! As for the lasagna, it wasn't really a showstopper for us. My mom said it tasted pretty weird, but that's ok. Our server Anthony was so nice and on top of the game, we really appreciated his service.  Even though my family had a good time, we won't be back just because of personal preferences."}
{"text":"I went here with my family on a whim. The New Haven style pizza is amazing. I had the Tuscany salad with grilled chicken. It was really good. My sister had the chicken parm and said it was great. The place is packed on the weekend so make a reservation."}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte this past weekend and we were in the mood for Italian, so we went to Mama Ricotta's. I am glad we made the choice to come here. From the moment we walked in, the staff was pretty friendly and accommodating. We got the Burrata & Prosciutto appetizer, it was lovely. Our entrees were Penne Alla Vodka and Rigatoni with Meat Sauce. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful; just like Italian food should be. 

We noticed that the dessert portions were enormous so we asked if we could be served just half of a tiramisu. Our waitress was absolutely accommodating and she made it happen. We weren't expecting to pay half price for the dessert we just didn't want the rest to go to waste, but she did charge us half price. I wish this place was in DC, we would be here all the time."}
{"text":"I'll give them the 4 stars on the house made bread alone. When we arrived they told us the bread was making, so we'd have to wait a moment..I can't say I was overjoyed to hear that. However, I was overjoyed when I tasted it. For my entree I ordered the roasted vegetable sandwich (we were there for lunch). It was splendid! The only thing I would've changed was maybe taking off the lettuce & tomato. I did love how nicely grilled the wrap was &, that the vegetable did not cause it to be soggy. To top it all off the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I got the penne vodka and he got the Marsala with chicken.  It wasn't anything amazing but the service was truly fantastic.  We were here on CIAA weekend and the place was packed at 8:30 at night.  Our water glasses were never more than half empty and our waitress was great and preemptive to our needs.  We will probably go back and try something different next time."}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant is a neighborhood staple. I work right across the street so it's no problem heading over for lunch. It's quick and always with friendly service. Most people are going for the classic pasta dishes. I'm down with the pizza. Not an off-menu item but, Mama Ricotta's is definitely underrated as a good pizza spot. Check out the pie on your next trip"}
{"text":"Went last night and it was great. The calamari was delicious. I then decided to order off the restaurant week menu. The shrimp was good, the penne all vodka was amazing, the chicken parm was good (needed more sauce for the chicken but overall good flavor) and the panna cotta for dessert was delicious. The people I was with really enjoyed their meals too.

Throughout our meal multiple workers would offer us water or more bread. Very attentive staff.

Our waitress was Raven. Even if our food wasn't good I would go back just for her. She was delightful throughout our entire dining experience."}
{"text":"Have been on multiple occasions and every visit has been wonderful. The food and service have been consistently good. The bruschetta is delicious as well as the tomato and mozzarella dish. Pizza, pasta dishes, seafood, and dessert- all were great."}
{"text":"This was really an awesome experience.  For the first time in I can't tell you how long every single person we interacted with was warm, friendly and seemingly happy to be there.  We are no strangers to fine dining, so I mean our experience varies from very high end restaurants to your run of the mill Flying Biscuit.
We were on our way to Dolce and they were closed for New Years so we headed over to Mama Ricotta's on a whim.
Rachel was our server and she was incredible, very sweet, totally knowledgable and seemed like she really loved food.  She was excited about their features, the ingredients used, the fact that they make their bread and mozz in house-just really genuine and lovely.  Our service was spectacular at every single stage.
The food runner was delightful, typically they drop the food unceremoniously but he was such a doll and really sweet the few times he stopped by our table.
The manager and hostess were both so polite, I was so happy to share our positive feedback with them.
My fiance who likes to eat and get the hell out of there was happy to linger over the most incredible tiramisu, it was just so cozy and comfortable!

Ordered the goat cheese and mascarpone app (10 out of 10) the Tuscan salads (10 out of 10) and we each had that Rigatoni (he had the meat sauce, I had vegetarian marinara which was no problem for them.  I graded it a 5/10, just boring and he thought it was wonderful) and the awesome lightly and fluffy tiramisu (10 out of 10)

Next time I will do the salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus, we are planning to return this Thursday and I already can't wait! 

THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 5, so I made reservations in advance but we were still seated in the bar area right next to the restrooms. It was a little loud, and people were constantly walking by to get to the restrooms. The waitress had a hard time serving us due to the table configuration (not her fault and she was very attentive). Appetizers and entrees were tasty and plentiful, and the wine pour was decent! I had the penne vodka topped with shrimp, which I can see why it was a signature dish. Leftovers the next day were just as good. The desserts were good, but nothing I haven't had before. The apple crisp (which was my pick) was served so hot that the ice cream quickly became soup and it actually burned my mouth so bad that I had blisters by the time I left. Tasting anything after that was a bit difficult.

I'll go back to try other dishes, as the food was well priced and tasty. I gave this 3 stars because the food and service were good, but couldn't get past my burnt mouth and being crammed into a corner table in the bar area with constant foot traffic area even after making advanced reservations."}
{"text":"To avoid the wait we were asked if bar area was okay. We said sure. So we waited for our server and waited and waited. She appears and we order drinks. She comes back to take our food orders, never goes over any specials. We didn't even know there was s special until another waiter told his tables. We ask if we can get sausage added in to the penne ala vodka and she says yes. It comes, sauce is thick and paste like. The Italian sausage that was too be added tasted just like smoked game. It was not good. Then we waited and waited again for the bill. Too bad, based off of other reviews we were excited to try it."}
{"text":"Delicious food, pleasant staff! Every encounter I've had with this restaurant has been a positive one. I'm that person who has lots of questions and everyone was patient and more than helpful with suggestions. The Penne Alla Vodka with Shrimp is absolutely delicious btw!"}
{"text":"First time here and service was exceptional. Food was great! The staff were very accommodating, I left the place very satisfied."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of italian food, even after spending a month in italy.
I remember coming here as a kid with my parents and never liking it. 
Somehow, after a few other places fell through, my husband and I's rehearsal dinner before our wedding was held here.
 I was pretty bummed since I knew I didnt like it but didnt want to upset my husbands parents who choose it and would be paying.

I don't remember everything we had, but it was all DELICIOUS. The salads, pastas and meats, and desserts were ALL really good. Everyone else agreed too and raved about the food for weeks after. I'm glad I gave this place another try, and now I will definitely be returning more often!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Our server Tiffany recommended the penne a la vodka for me, and the chicken parmesan for my husband since he does not like spicy food. She also recommended the wine feature, which I had a glass of and my husband enjoyed the local draft selections. Tiffany was friendly and made us feel at home. She went the extra mile to keep our drinks full and checked in to make sure we were happy with our meals. The penne a la vodka was so delicious. I am Italian, and it's great to find a local restaurant that reminds me of family dinners growing up. I highly recommend Mama Ricotta's!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! We made a 7:15 reservation but weren't seated until 7:40 which bummed us out at first but once we had our food it wasn't as big of the deal. We managed to squeeze our way near the bar for a drink while we waited. 

I got the Amma's Cheese Ravioli with meat sauce and the BF got the Penne Alla Vodka. Both were so good. We will be back when we are craving Itlian."}
{"text":"Great food! Our server David was very attentive. He recommended the vodka penne pasta, wine and Mama's salad! Definitely going back and requesting Dave."}
{"text":"Let me be clear: the 2nd star is based solely on the efforts of the staff to turn around our abysmal food experience. Based on food alone it would be a single star, however the staff really tried to make it up to us.

My husband and I ate here this evening. First off we were accosted by a quasi-speed metal song that was completely inappropriate to the setting. 

We were seated promptly without a reservation and the waiter quickly took our order.

The server brought some cold, salty garlic rolls. Not an encouraging start to the meal but we plowed ahead -- my husband ordered chicken parmesan and I ordered butternut squash ravioli. The chicken was breaded in what looked to be almost a cracker or corn flake crust rather than breadcrumbs, making it heavy. The plate was just a big pile of spaghetti topped with this chicken wedge glued with red sauce. Not attractive, adequately tasty.

My ravioli was barely cooked. Some parts weren't cooked at all, making an unappetizing paste-y glob. The server was quick to notice something amiss and  quickly replaced the plate with another entree, the eggplant parmesan. Way too salty and an unholy mess of cheese and overcooked spaghetti.

The side of spinach was also much too salty and I finally threw in the towel, completely defeated by this awful meal. Maybe it was an off night but the people around us didn't seem to be having the same issues with their meals. If this is the best Italian food that Charlotte has to offer, than I am forewarned. 

The manager came over and asked if there was anything he could do, offered to comp us a dessert and generally tried to make things right. It was unfortunate that the meal was unsalveageable."}
{"text":"Second time visiting Mama Ricotta's in a week!!  Can you say we LOVE this place!!??  The chopped salad is to die for!!!  A must try!!  We split the small sale three ways and it was plenty.  The penne Alla vodka with chicken is amazing!  I make my own, and the one at Mama Ricotta's is head to heads with mine, delicious!!!  The chicken used in the cheese Ken Romano is superior quality, so tender, full of flavor, juicy.  The tiramisu came highly recommended and it did not disappoint!!!  You MUST save room for this dessert.  Fabulous Italian restaurant in midtown."}
{"text":"Let me just say, the wine and company of my friend were the best parts of our experience.  

The complementary bread was dry, crumbly and not very good. 

The Bruschetta was absolutely terrible!!! The bread was soggy and topped with tons of acidic tomatoes. I was surprised when the waitress brought it out to us, there was no buffalo mozzarella. I asked her where the cheese was?  She said it doesn't come with any, and she came back out with a tiny condiment cup full. That was a nice gesture, I suppose. 

My friend absolutely loves tomatoes, and I could tell she was completely put off by this dish from the look on her face from the first bite.  We both only ate one to be polite."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since it was in its old location (the fantastic Indian restaurant Maharani now inhabits the space) and it is definitely a Charlotte mainstay.  I'm not the richest of people and I always find something affordable and yummy here.  I love their garlic rolls, their lasagna and their desserts are some of the best in town (big portions, too - good to split with a friend or on a date).  I always leave the place with leftovers... I like a place that can feed me twice.  

My only beef with them is that they took my FAVORITE pizza - the Balsamic glazed pork bbq pizza - off the menu.  Why!!!  Sometimes it can get a little crowded and quite loud, but the service is always nice and prompt and the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"I do not have much to say about this place other than the food is horrible.

the people are nice but the food is horrible if you are itialian and the cook is not even itialian.

stay away if you want real itialian food."}
{"text":"Pasta primavera and garlic bread were delicious. Our server, Ben, was fantastic. Highly recommend! The best Italian Restaurant in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is pretty good, doesn't look so pleasant from the outside but once you go inside it looks and feels pretty nice inside. The goat cheese bread appetizer is highly advisable to get and its an outstanding choice. For dinner I had the lasagna, it's made with their hand made sausage and its loaded with cheese. If you're looking for a diamond in the rough kinda place to eat, this is your choice."}
{"text":"My wife had the ROASTED VEGETABLES sandwich with hand-cut potato chips and it was excellent.  I ordered the Calamari (not the Rhode Island-Style) and PENNE, BROCCOLI & CHICKEN and I was not very impressed with either one.  I like my calamari crispier and the chicken was cubes of chicken instead of strips and it was not roasted.  They served rolls of (looked like the kind you buy frozen) bread instead of the homemade loaf of bread you will normally find at an Italian Restaurant."}
{"text":"Been to Mamas dozens of times over the past 10 years.
The last few times out experience was just fair.
Last night we went there for a birthday dinner...mistake
1st thing they put the 7 of us in a small table for 6 max...how to you have any room for the food? DUH (plus the place was not even busy)
They did accommodate us after my request to put 2 tables together.
We ordered a few appetizers to start...one of them being the mozzarella and tomatoes, we ordered the big portion and asked for the red peppers addition as usual. The order came to the table with 3 small slices of mozzarella and banana peppers. I again had to request a correction. I don't mind paying restaurant markups...but come on a few tomatoes and the paltry amount of cheese for like 9 bucks...shame on you.
When the entrees came the runner looks at us like make room. Of course the table was full because the the app and salad courses had not been cleared.
Going to a restaurant should not be about correcting step by step...it should be about having relaxing and fun time.
There are many good choices in Charlotte, unfortunately Mama Ricottas looks like it may no longer be one of them."}
{"text":"We've been to Mama Ricotta's multiple times and it's been delicious every visit.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Mama Ricotta's for Mother's Day dinner this past Sunday. I made a reservation through opentable which apparently didn't go through properly, however the host was very accommodating and able to get us a table on the patio. I do not hold the faults of open table against them. I want to start by saying that for the most part, the food was excellent. My mom had the penne a la vodka and it was amazing. I had the chicken parm which was also very good. This being said, my daughter's meal was ice cold (it was a grilled cheese) by the time the replacement came out everyone had already finished their meal and she was full from eating off everyone else's plate. The reason I am giving this place two stars is because of the service. Being that it was a holiday none of us were expecting the service to be super speedy, but our server was not only slow, but not attentive and rude. He never once wished us a happy Mother's Day, he didn't introduce himself, instead of asking what anyone wanted to drink he just brought waters, and anyone who wanted anything else they had to take it upon themselves to order it. If we needed a refill, we had to wave the server down and ask for it. Not to mention the fact that he came and refilled our water glasses with warm water. (We we're sitting on the patio where it was 80 degrees). He was not the server who delivered our food, and he never followed up to even ask us how our food was, or if we needed anything else. It was only after we complained to the manager that he even came to our table. The manager addressed the issue with the server, and he returned with a very sarcastic tone making sure to emphasize how our water now had ice in it and was cold. Our servers name is Stewart. It is because of him that I, nor anyone in my family, will return to this restaurant. This is a shame considering how good the food is, but being paying customers, I believe we deserve to be treated much better than that. If you do go to this restaurant and you have Stewart as a server have zero expectations of good service. I will also be posting this review on Facebook and google, because of how offended I am by how my family was treated."}
{"text":"Finally made it to MR's!  Wow!  It was sooooo good!  I can't wait to go back!  They even brought me a canolli for my birthday.  Service was great too!  I'm so hungry just thinking about that chicken parm I had.  YUM!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Mama Ricotta's. The location does it ZERO justice (strip mall). But the interior is great and I actually love the outdoor seating - considering the Kings Dr. location.

They have really good pizza. Perfect for take out. I adore the angel hair pasta with added chicken. The rigatoni with meat sauce is also delicious. I normally choose one of those two. Though I have tried some others like the Pasta Fra Diavolo which was good.

The boyfriend loves the calzones. Which is totally random - but whatever, it lets me get to go to Mama's!

I went once for Brunch and had the richest stuffed panini french toast ever. Ohhh was it good!! 

Worth a visit for sure!"}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful.  Had my birthday dinner here, party of 20. The staff were accommodating,  Mark was attentive and the food.. yum.com. Love dining here!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and the food was amazing we mainly had pasta dishes my one daughter had a white pie that was delicious. All the dishes were delicious and I would recommend it to anyone to try, service was great and they have a outdoor seating area which was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place! The food is great and has been the only really good Italian place we have found that is not overly fancy. Have brought all of our visitors here for a nice dinner!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while on vacation in charlotte.  We wanted Italian since we had satisfied our palates on other foods throughout our trip.  Don't be fooled with the strip shop location, this is a nice little place very close to downtown charlotte.

I had the chicken parm-- way to much for me to finish.  Which was a shame since I was not going to travel with my leftovers.  Wife got the oxtail ragu dish, she was not a big fan of.  Fatty beef, etc.  our two small kids are just fine with buttered spaghetti noodles and parm cheese.

Wait staff was very good.  Highly recommend this place if you're looking for some nice Italian.  Family friendly, but you can also do a date night here just as easy."}
{"text":"I've been going here since 2000 but never have fallen in love with it like everyone else. Maybe I'm weird. Maybe I've got a very sensitive palette. Maybe I'm just not average, but I find Mama Ricotta's well below average and very very very salty.  I'm not someone who shies away from salt- I always have it on my eggs, etc.  But it seems like recently, everything at Mama's is over seasoned.  A lot of the dishes like the Pasta Primavera is very unremarkable so generally I like the chicken carciofi the best, but perhaps because of the capers it is so salty I can never finish it. I went there for a business lunch (basically the only reason I'll go) and had a roasted beet salad. I thought I was in the clear with a salad, but no- it was so salty too! A salad?? And not a nicoise salad?? It was very strange and it was very overdressed. Perhaps next time I'm forced to go, maybe I should try a sandwich? 

The other complaint i have about this place is the service. One time recently the server was really inattentive. The second time, the server was really bitchy (and it was a guy). I've never understood how someone who relies on tips is smug and rude. Anyway that paired with the mediocre food means I'm never going to intentionally go here. I'd opt for Fiamma, Luciano's or Hawthorne's Pizza before here any day."}
{"text":"Place has a great atmosphere. The customer service we received from Rachel and Kevin was outstanding.  The food was good, however the lasagna was a little burnt at the bottom, but all around good at the top.  Don't let my comment turn you away it could be all that yummy cheese falling around and gathering down...it is a place to try."}
{"text":"Great Italian cuisine! My first visit to Mama Ricotta's was this past Saturday and it was a wonderful experience. The staff were very nice and the food was outstanding! I had a steak special and the flank steak was tender and flavorful.  I also tried my friends pasta's and they beat Olive Garden or Carraba's no question. The bread pudding desert topped it off. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Here's the deal, I've been going to Mama Ricotta's  for over a year. My family has celebrated many birthday dinners here. Why? Because the food truly is outstanding! Now over this past year I have constantly found that that great food is not enough for my to want to be a frequent customer. The service leaves something to be desired to say the least. Just tonight I felt like I should be honored that I could dine at MC's and not the other way around. I'm not looking for a 5 star experience but I am looking to be treated like a customer and not another transaction. My wife and I are pretty easy going as we both worked food service during college. Even tonight when the service was bad we still tip 20%. As we left the hostess couldn't even be bothered to look up from her phone to say have a good evening... instead she mumbled it to the stack of menus. I will continue to visit because I do enjoy the food but I think it terms of customer experience a local chick fil a has them beat x10. This is not the first time my family has felt like this after eating at Mama Ricotta's but I thought it was time to say something. Oh and it was weird that our waitress sat the tea pitcher on the ground near my table and left it sitting there unroll another table asked for a refill... just seems unsanitary.

If your looking for great food it's here as long as you are ok with just being another transaction. For me it just means we don't visit as often and are on the look out for a replacement."}
{"text":"Very casual, great Italian food with huge portions. The rub a wine special on Wednesdays. Great area to eat and walk around as well"}
{"text":"I'd heard a lot of good things about this place so when I had the opportunity to plan an event for a group of my girlfriends Mama Ricotta's immediately came to mind!

I'm happy to report that this place didn't disappoint! I'd made reservations online and they called to confirm my reservations early that afternoon. When we arrived our table was ready with no wait! 

Our waiter was kind enough to go over all the specials and give us time to look over the menu. For such a large party, I was glad to see that our glasses were never empty and all our orders were right when they hit the table. 

I ordered the lasagna. It's not your typical lasagna, they call it \"southern Italian style\" and it's a mix of beef, veal and homemade sausage with a cheese blend on a bed of sauce. It was very meaty and cheesy as it should be with a classic sauce. I enjoyed every bite. Add to that those freaking addicting garlic roll (perfect for dipping) and I'd absolutely order it again. 

There were a lot of other dishes on our table that looked amazing so I'm definitely coming back for more goodies...and some dessert!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype.  Best Italian in Charlotte (that I've had*).

Got some penne w/ Vodka that was straight doooope (word to the wise:  'add dat meat')

I would highly suggest that one goes here."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great Italian in Charlotte that is NOT a chain like Carabba's or Olive Garden, you have found it at Mama Ricotta's! How could you not love it with Ricotta in the actual name! I first went on a date with a boyfriend and really enjoyed it. But it wasn't until, when I eventually tried the Goat Cheese and Marscapone dip months later, was it necessary that I return weekly to satisfy my craving. If you are a big fan of cheese or pizza (who isn't?) then you will LOVE this. It's like creamy little salty, sweet heaven on a crustini. Dang, now I'm hungry... 

Moving on now... the service is always impeccable and the people are very friendly. I always spot the same two men observing and attending to the guests in the dining room. I could never figure out if these men are the managers or the actual owners, but I like that they are always visible. 

I have frequented Mama Ricotta's on busy weekend nights but seem to never have to wait for a table. The prices are reasonable. I suspect you could dine there for 2 at about $50 to $70. 

I highly recommend Mama Ricotta's if you live in the uptown or Dilworth area for awesome Italian but I also highly suggest fitting in lots of cardio the following day. ;)"}
{"text":"I don't get all the hype, it wasn't that good. I expected extraordinary Italian  food and that wasn't the case. Only 3 stars on the first visit. I will give them another try based on the hype."}
{"text":"I came here thanks to Yelp reviews. This restaurant is delicious omg I found my new Italian spot. I brought my family here and they absolutely loved it. I ordered chicken penne with broccoli but subsisted the chicken for shrimp and it was literally the best thing ever! My son finished his whole pizza. I ate his crust and even that was so good. I'm already planning my next trip back here."}
{"text":"I was expecting to be blown away after reading some of the reviews but I hate to say that wasn't the case. The food OK, you can get the same quality from some of the nationally chains that are out there. SO the search continues for a authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner before going to the Knights game. He usually stops in for the lunch specials from the Metropolitan and wanted to show me the place. We were sat right away and given bread and oil. It was ok, I don't think it was typical olive oil, but mixed with something else. 

We ordered the calamari, and we split the spaghetti and meatballs. The calamari was good, my favorite part of the meal in fact. Done the Italian way, flash fried, and with marinara. The meatballs were turkey prosciutto, and it just wasn't the same. I tried. My husband said he liked them. 

They do have $3 domestic pints on Thursdays which included OMB. My husband was happy about that.  The waitress was good, friendly."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and great atmosphere!! If you want great Italian food this is the place to come to. Bruschetta is a must have, and you need to end the meal with a scrumptious slice of tiramisu for dessert!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best Italian food I have ever had, and being from NJ, I have had quite a bit of Italian food. The atmosphere is laid back, and the service in impeccable. Our server Daniel was fantastic and I will be requesting him the next time I go.

I had the Penne Vodka which was great, and the Tiramisu was delicious. My wife had the special, which was braised short ribs and was also a hit.

I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Even though we sat at the pizza bar on a Tuesday night. It was great! This had to be the best cooked pasta I have ever had in a restaurant! Coming back next time in the area"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. You can always expect great service and even better food! We love to get the family size penne a la vodka with shrimp to share. Every server we've had has been very helpful and attentive without being pushy or annoying! Always look forward to going for casual date nights :) 
PS don't leave without ordering a cannoli- or two!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Loved the ambience, but I just wasn't impressed with the food. Had the penne vodka and it was just ok. Also ordered a cheese pizza and it was soggy and bland. The best thing I had was the goat cheese appetizer which was very flavorful. My dining companion had the shrimp scampi and said it was ok but lacked in flavor. Overall not sure what the \"hype\" is about. I've had better Italian at pizzerias. Would maybe return for drinks bc I loved the ambience of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Maybe we came on an off night? We used to really like their lasagna and pizza. The visit before this one, they changed brands of Gorgonzola and  the pizza was too pungent to finish.  This visit we noticed the menu is getting lighter and lighter and not for the better. Even the rolls were almost stale. Glad we did not get the bread pudding for that probably would have been off too. I will say our server was great and very attentive.  Guess I will stick to a salad, appetizers and bread pudding."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves amazing pasta! I recommend the spinach tagliatelle carbonara. The pasta is fresh and delicious. I'll come again and try pizza. I heard they're great too."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian! I highly recommend the ravioli and the polenta was out of this world!! Both were close to the best I had ever had. The spaghetti and meatballs was ok. And the nutella pie was an obvious hit! Try Mama Ricotta's for dependable, quality Italian food in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"A friend and I met here for early dinner before an event at Blumenthal. Our waitress was very helpful and friendly in assisting us with our wine and entree courses. We were very disappointed in our pizza. The crust was definitely burned and we pointed that out to waitress who immediately offered to have another made for us . We were constrained by time and didn't want to leave a pizza in the car for several hours. She had manager comp us a free dessert which we were going to get anyway. I know this restaurant has been a mainstay for Charlotte residents and visitors for years and have frequented it myself many times over the years. This anomaly of burned pizza was a shock because I expect more from a restaurant of your reputation. Surely quality should be a given. At the very least we shouldn't have had to pay for it since we left half of it there and ate only toppings of the rest."}
{"text":"I was in town for an interview and picked this place at random for some Italian food, which I have been starved for since moving to NC from P A. I had pasta with a wonderful carbonara sauce. I'll go here again. Manager Marco is a really nice guy, great service from Beth at the bar. Super quick service, friendly staff. A winner."}
{"text":"We dined there yesterday, and my husband got severe food poisoning. It was the last day of restaurant week, and the restaurant was packed, so I'm not sure if they mishandled the food in the process."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch. I recently went for the first time and the service and food were good. Convenient location and nice ambiance."}
{"text":"This was our third visit to Mama Ricotta's. We took my husband there for Father's Day. We were greeted and seated by their hostess, Madison, who was wonderful!! She was so hospitable, friendly, professional and super attentive. She greeted us immediately with a warm smile and checked on us twice during our meal to make certain we were having a great dining experience. She rocks! The food was once again excellent! I had the shrimp scampi and my husband had chicken parm which was also excellent. Our kids had penne alla vodka which they loved!! The food and hostess were a 5, but our server brought our experience down a notch. We did not have reservations and it was packed so we opted to sit in the cocktail lounge. The server there was very slow, inattentive and overall not good. He didn't listen well and we had to repeatedly ask for refills and ice. He never checked on us. He just didn't seem committed. Other than that everything else was excellent."}
{"text":"It has been a really long time since I have eaten at Mama Ricotta's, and I can't believe that I had not previously written a review for it! So, when I found myself in the area around lunch-time today I decided to stop in and see what's on the menu these days.

For lunch, they have several sandwich options as well as yummy looking pizza selections. However, I haven't had pasta in a while, so I decided to go for that instead.  I was sort of in the mood for a red sauce, but as I perused the menu, nothing in that category jumped out at me. Instead, the chicken & broccoli penne pasta was calling my name.   So, I went with it and sure am glad that I did.  The sauce was somewhat creamy - but not too heavy.  It had a lot of garlic (yum) and a nice lemony flavor.  I enjoyed it very much.   At lunch, this entrée was $8 and I had enough to take some home for later. 

Since I was by myself, I just sat at the bar.  The guy behind the bar was a bit busy since he was taking care of all the take-out orders.  The service was a bit \"meh\" but that's what I get for sitting at the bar. Next time, I would skip the bar area and just get a table instead."}
{"text":"This would be my second time going. I went with a friend around 3pm for a late lunch. The first server who was with us seemed to be off--as in I sort of got the vibe that he didn't want to serve us. We knew what we wanted and after telling him he stated he didn't have his notepad and pen to write it down and that he would be back. He didn't come back and we were given another server, Anthony. Anthony brought us our drinks and fresh bread. He was such a great server and really compensated for the weird interaction with the previous server. Anthony was very attentive throughout the whole time we were there and would be one of the reasons we would return! 

We started off with the calamari. The calamari was DELICIOUS. It was plated beautifully and for an appetizer the portion is well worth your money. The calamari was well fried and I personally enjoyed dipping it into the marinara sauce that was also came with the dish. For our meals I got the angel hair pasta with the tomato basil sauce and chicken and my friend got the ravioli. For my pasta, the amount of chicken was a generous amount and made well. The pasta was cooked to perfection and overall tasted really good. I would definitely recommend this dish.

For our lunch ended up being around $30 which is not bad for the amount of food we got. As for parking-- there is a lot of space behind the restaurant if the spaces upfront are full."}
{"text":"We decided on Italian for the evening since my brother is a vegetarian and no one else was interested in dining at the Penguin Drive-Thru or Price's Chicken Coop.

The atmosphere is very relaxing and comfortable. I am a fan of dim lighting, it's very calming and soothing. We are immediately greeted by our server who wasted no time with the drink and food specials of the evening.

I opted on the alcohol because I was still feeling nauseous from the 6 hour flight. We decided on sharing a large pepperoni and sausage pizza with a family style portion  of their Rigatoni with this sausage meat sauce. 

Service was great, the refills and warm herb bread with a spicy chili oil kept coming. I was stuffed but satisfied. Not bad for my first Italian meal in North Carolina."}
{"text":"Very good food.  We had lasagna, chicken with spaghetti and rigitoni.  Appetizer goat cheese in sauce was excellent   Waitress was very attentive.  Very casual and relaxing."}
{"text":"I had heard really fantastic things about Mama Ricotta's. Being new to Charlotte and looking for a great place to celebrate my birthday, a few friends and myself decided to try it out.

I'm giving it 2 stars not because of the food, the food was amazing - rather, it was the way we were treated by the staff. Our server was impatient, hurried us along in our orders, and really just seemed to be bothered by the fact that we were there at all. When asked if we needed more time and we responded with \"yes,\" they were visibly annoyed by our request for a few more moments. Twice, the servers also sat the plates down in front of the wrong people (definitely not a big deal, it happens). It was just the reaction when we started rearranging plates that was surprising - they treated us as if we were wrong, as if we hadn't known what we ordered. 

Upon walking in, the hostess seemed to be inconvenienced by the fact we had no reservation. Rather than adopting an accommodating attitude, she really tried to undersell the section we were seated in. Numerous times, we all felt very rushed during our time there as she was constantly peeking around the corner, very obviously checking to see how close we were to finishing our meals.

Long story short, not impressed by the staff. Luckily, the food is so good I'm sure I'll probably return - but, next time, just for takeout."}
{"text":"Used to like this place. The food is 6/10 but it's pretty reasonable. Called three times recently to place a take out order, was put on hold, and then hung up on. Obviously they don't need my business. I won't be calling or going there again."}
{"text":"Food was good but service subpar. Sat next to previous owner. Staff including manager so far up his butt that our food took forever. Service was awful. Following example of leader. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed. I've been here three times now and the first two times were amazing. I'm not kidding, they took care of us, the waiter was friendly and they even changed out my salmon when it wasn't up to their standards,again amazing. BUT this third time was not a shining star like I'd hoped it would be. 

I brought my cousins from out of town they love Italian food! I had such nice service the two previous times I just knew they'd love it here because of the good food and the good service. 

Our server was very neglectful. It took her a very long time to come take our drink order. Which we weren't ready for because they didn't give us a cocktail list. So we order appetizers, calamari and the bruschetta, and she got the cocktail menus, brought them to us, and left again. Our appetizers came and her second return took much too long again. So we ordered drinks and She carded me, my boyfriend and my cousin which is fine,I'm 26, he's 23, and he's 22, so we're all used to that and I don't fault her for it. She took our drink orders, and food orders and walked away without taking our menus from us or saying another thing. Now it was four of us sitting at our small table with two appetizers, a bread bowl and bread plates and all the extras you can think of on the table. There was no where for us to put anything let alone menus we no longer needed. My boyfriend asked the hostess who was walking by to take the menus and mentioned that our waitress wasn't really caring for us. 

Next thing I know the manager came over and apologized for the lack of caring and for her not taking the menus which seemed super nice. It reminded me of the other times we were here when they took such good care of us.  But that wasn't really why he was at our table that was just glanced over. He really just wanted to see our IDs too. I'm a reasonable person and I understand needing to be carded but by TWO different people at a very nice sit down restaurant just seems over kill to me. Especially when my already non caring waitress walked away acting like she's going to put our orders in. At least warning us that you just want you manager to check our IDs would have made it feel less degrading. Honestly this whole thing made me feel pretty down on this place. It's really disappointing and severely changes my opinion of this place which sucks because we really loved it before this. 

The food was good and thats the only reason it's four stars and not three, but I just don't need to pay that amount of money to feel degraded and unhappy after I have a meal somewhere."}
{"text":"Traveling with my fiancé to visit my sister and I made this reservation on open table. When we arrived we waited a few minutes for our table which was completely fine. The patio was being re-done and while I like al fresco dining probably couldn't do it there as it was just too hot for me. The restaurant has a lively, buzzing sound to it. While I won't say it isn't for romantic nights out, it's not a quiet place. 

When we sat water was brought over for everyone. The girls ordered a bottle of wine, and we started with an order of calamari. Rhode Island style. The balance between the hot peppers and calamari was perfect. Not over cooked. And a very good flavor. I had a carbonara which I added chicken too. Fiancé had a chicken dish that was very good. And my sister did the restaurant week menu. Everything she had was great. Everyone had enough to take home. The service was absolutely phenomenal. Raven was on point, humorous, engaging, and always there when we needed her. 

The one negative about this place, and it can't be a negative in a sense, is the Togo is done at the bar and it took me a few minutes to get a drink while waiting for a table. I wish there was another bartender on or someone just for Togo help. When I visit my sister I will try and make it back there again."}
{"text":"First time patrons. We were talked into sitting on the patio which was quiet at first, but as the evening ensued so did the noise level. Next time I want to try indoors ambiance. A spider came down on me during dinner. Food was good, very good. Service was just okay. He brought dinner not only before salads were finished, but before starter plates were cleared. (Servers should run their own food - not food runners).  So the food runner came running out with our plates and I lifted my appetizer plate so he could set it down and it nearly missed the table and hung there off the edge. But we'll be back to try again... this may have to be a carry out experience to be totally content."}
{"text":"Mama Ricotta's sets out to be good old fashioned Italian home cooking, an admirable and delicious goal no doubt.  The problem is that they don't really set them selves apart from what your average Italian girl (or guy) ::raises hand:: can actually make in their home.

The pasta special, a tilapia, shrimp and scallop spaghetti dish with a slightly spicy sauce, was the exception to this rule. It had a delicious sea flavor and I regret not having ordered it as my dinner. My penne vodka sounded enticing, promising pepper vodka and including pancetta, but the sauce ended up being unsensational.  Looking at the rest of the menu, I saw a lot of familiar characters: lasagna, angel hair with red sauce, and chicken romano to name a few, but few options that jumped out and screamed that I needed to try it.

I love Italian food at least as much as the next girl but if I am going to go out for it I want to be impressed and while Mama Ricotta's provided a good meal it didn't shine."}
{"text":"Mama Ricotta's is my ideal Italian restaurant. From the layout of the interior, to the style of service, to the quality of the food- this place has it all. If overall fitness and money weren't an issue, you would probably find me eating here 6 out of the 7 nights a week. Love Italian!!!

The food is absolutely great. Each table receives free bread appetizers and are served with a very tasty EVOO. Ask for a little balsamic on the side and you can literally make a meal out of this in itself! 

Additional appetizers and salads, such as the Fried Calamari & the Sicilian Roasted Pepper Salad, are also very, very good. For an entree, I had myself a basic vodka blush sauce over angel hair dish that was absolutely phenomenal. 

The menu is pretty broad and you won't have a hard time finding something you like if your a picky eater. It is somewhat on the pricey side, but rarely will you be dissapointed with the meal in comparison to the cost.

Despite the location (nestled in a small shopping center), the overall layout is perfect for Italian atmosphere. The interior is dolled-up in a very elegant, but not over elegant way. The noise is adequate and seating can be a little tight at certain times, i.e. a Saturday night. The exterior & outdoor seating are decorated with lattice and vine, has good lighting, and is great weather permitting.

They have a full bar (inside) to accomodate your choice of drink, and offer different specials per day of the week. 

Overall, this is my new favorite in Charlotte for dine-in Italian. A must!"}
{"text":"BEST Italian restaurant in the area.  everything I've had here has been delicious, especially the tiramisu!  not only is the food authentic, the waitstaff is pleasant and at the table the perfect amount of time.

also - my husband and I brought my grandparents here when they were visiting from out of town.  they've travelled all over the world and were apparently raving about this place to my parents - weeks later!  count that as an extra testament to how awesome this place is.

we've lived within 30 minutes of this place for 6 years, but only recently heard about it from a friend.  all of our family lives out of town and we always struggle to think of reasonably priced restaurants to take people to when they visit - we'll be bringing all of our future visitors here!"}
{"text":"Came here for New Year's Eve dinner with 12 guests.  We were immediately seated (had prior reservations), and were surprised that they had a special menu.  I had been under the assumption they had a normal menu in addition to their special menu, but that was not the case.  

Nevertheless, we all had a great time.  I had a chicken dish with polenta, which wasn't anything special, but it wasn't bad.  I would, however, steer clear of their pizza dish of the night, which was truffle oil, pancetta, wild mushrooms and fingerling potatoes.  I think it might have something to do with seeing it reconstituted by a friend later that evening.  

Good service, and good, if not memorable, food."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food! I don't know why I haven't heard much about this place before. I'm definitely going to be here again for whenever I want Italian. It only loses 1 star for the overpriced alcoholic drinks, otherwise it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"The food here was just adequate. And the ridiculous part of our lunch was that the check  was delivered before the meal! What's that about? The waiter said they get really busy so they bring the check first. I've been eating out in restaurants for many years and no one has every brought the check before a morsel of food was eaten. The menu states that whole wheat pasta is available but never mentions it's a $1.50 up charge. I might return someday but I won't be anytime soon."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal!  Lasagne had a nice texture to it, sauce was fantastic!  Chicken parm was great as well!  Hands down great meal!  Our server was also wonderful!  Very attentive!  Staff worked as a team and all were very friendly!  The Nutella pie and cannoli were AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We went here for the Queen's Feast a couple weeks ago - and had dinner from the preset \"QF\" menu. Everything was good, however I felt a bit rushed due to how busy they were on a Saturday night. I suspect it was like that because of the Queen's Feast and I would have liked a little more time in between the appetizer... and the entree... we only get a couple nights out a month sans kids after all! :)  We will definitely return for another dinner one night- it was very good."}
{"text":"No surprise but this is the best place in town for Italian food. Really love their lamb chops and lasagne is out of this world. I keep seeing everyone having pizza's but I'm still working through the rest of menu first.

The staff is awesome and this is a destination place for Italian food when your in Charlotte. 

BTW: In the autumn and winter they do the best bread pudding. In fact I had to stop in there the other night just to pick up and order. Beware 1 order of bread pudding is more than enough for two people."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch here. I ordered the Penne Alla Vodka with Chicken and my son ordered Cheese Ravioli with Alfredo sauce. We received free bread with olive oil which had a few chili peppers making it spicy. Our food came within 10 minutes of ordering. Our meal was delicious and very filling. The service was also great and food was reasonably priced. We will definitely return again."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying: I love Mama Ricotta's food. I've had several great experiences both in the restaurant and with their catering. That being said, last night's performance -aside from the scrumptious food- was not acceptable.

I went with a group of ~15 people to Mama Ricotta's for a Christmas function. I was one of the people that voted to have the event at the restaurant because I've had such great experiences in the past. I know a larger party requires patience on both ends and that mistakes are inevitable, but we had quite a few... our drink orders were mixed up repeatedly. One person ordered a salad with romaine lettuce and it came out with iceburg. The servers kept placing the wrong meals with the wrong individuals, which I know is hard not to do with a big group -but it added to our frustration. We did all get our food, but none of the dishes came out at the same time, so several people's food was cold by the time the final entree came out. 

The real fun started with the checks. Given the issues we had getting the right entree/drink to the right person, we knew the bills were going to be a nightmare -and they were. It took nearly 45 minutes to get our bills straightened out. By the time I actually received my bill (which was about 10 minutes after everyone else had paid and was leaving the restaurant) it was incorrect. I notified the server that my glass of Pinot Grigio was not on the ticket, he asked if that was a red wine. I know you only have to be 18 to serve alcohol, but it's important for servers to know which wines are white and which are red for customer service purposes. The server tried again with the ticket, which I had to go to the hostess stand to get, and it still did not have a glass of wine on it. Because I needed to leave I spoke to the manager, who was very nice and told me just to pay for my entree... but he kind of made me feel like I was making a stink to get my wine comped -which was not the case.

Will I try Mama Ricotta's again? Yes, but never again will I go back with a large group & I'll make sure not to order wine next time."}
{"text":"First time at Mama Ricotta's. My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night (without reservations) and luckily snagged a seat at the pizza bar. Make reservations if you can! 

I thoroughly enjoyed watching the cooks make various pizzas and different dishes. However, the cooks went from plating food and adding toppings to pizza to touching receipts and pizza boxes, and then back to plating food. I know that this would affect their health score rating...so better to fix it now then after the fact. 

Besides that, the food was amazing!!! We both ordered the chicken parmesan which comes with a huge helping of homemade spaghetti. Definitely lots of leftovers! Next time I'm ordering the sangria (authentic- made with rum and brandy) and tiramisu.  Two thumbs up (minus the food safety issue)....would give the food four plus stars."}
{"text":"The pollo Romano was great! I ordered a side of sauce to dip it in. The service was awesome too!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch today!  The lasagna was fantastic.  Ally was one of the best servers I have had in years.  I can't say enough positive things about the overall experience."}
{"text":"Mama Ricotta's has some seriously good Italian food! I went on a Friday evening at 6. The wait was 35 minutes but the two of us immediately found a seat at the pizza bar. We ordered the goat cheese app, lasagna, and pollo blanco. The goat cheese dip was so yummy, I will be ordering every time I visit. It was a large portion and came with bread slices and a red sauce. I had the lasagna and loved it. I was fairly full after the appetizer and took most of it home. It took quite a while for the food to come out after the appetizer but nothing to be upset about. Parking was available and loved the interior."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Make sure you come with an appetite but if not, always share! There will be plenty!! Great service! Pasta and pizza are equally great!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love GOOD Italian food, thus the reason it's been several years since my last visit here. I was asked to give them another try by 2 fellow foodies, mainly because they made the signature bread pudding sound so good and there was a $20 certificate for $5 on juice in the city.....that is the only reason I returned after all this time. I'm not sure how this place has been here as long as they have, I mean let's be honest.....the food is sub par. Again, I am a lover of Italian food and if your signature rigatoni with meat sauce can't even compete with stouffer's.....that's a problem. I mean the noodles were hard and chewy, the sauce was salty and the bread was tasteless....this is a basic Italian dish which I would think could never be screwed up........geez! The penne alla vodka was also full of salt with hard and chewy noodles......glad I only paid $5 bucks! The bread pudding, which is not on the menu, gave me something to smile about after a bad meal.......It was covered in caramel sauce I think and served with ice cream.......very good...........to bad they're not a dessert bar."}
{"text":"We had our baby shower here, so I have nostalgic feelings. I had the pizza, which was pretty damn good. My wife got the shrimp salad, and the shrimp was probably thawed frozen. We emailed the manager, and HE WAS SO HELPFUL and apologetic. That won me over forever. Places like this need to stay in business. I will go back for that reason.

Would otherwise give it 3.5 *'s."}
{"text":"Wonderful food every time we dine here!! Highly suggest eating here but come hungry!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place I'm going to make reservations today for Saturday for my girlfriend and I...can't wait!!!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food that's not hard on the wallet. Good portion size. Service is friendly but slow. The Nutella pie was amazing. Will visit again"}
{"text":"Itttt's Restaurant Week - Hooray!  So, Italian it is!  Atmosphere is very casual (so much so you can bring some rugrats and they'll fit in.)  Service was very attentive (maybe our gal tried a little too hard),   The food was rich & plentiful (had salads, penne ala vodka, ravioli, & tiramisu,) but nothing stood out.  The flavors were nice, but the dishes unexciting.  And alas, the tiramisu did not have nearly enough alcohol in it (if it had any at all!)  Can I get a second that this is the best part?!  Anywho, I would come here again, but only for lunch.  I would rather spend my entree money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Have eaten lunch and dinner here. Neither disappointed. 

For an appetizer I recommend the in house made buffalo mozzarella.  

The Nutella peanut butter pie is amazing.  The crust is the perfect container for the sweet cream of the filling.

I had the steak and mushroom risotto for dinner. Really enjoyed the texture of this dish. The flavors worked.

Friendly bartender."}
{"text":"Tasty Italian food with good sized portions and nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Moved back to Charlotte after 4 years and I'm happy to say this place is just as good as ever. My personal favorite, the goat cheese dip, is still available. Order this and you'll see why we order it every time. Chicken Marsala is another favorite and of course the lasagna which is hearty and has more than enough cheese."}
{"text":"Used call ahead seating on a Friday night and glad we did because the placed was busy. That's always a good sign.
The food was excellent and we took advantage of the drink specials.
We sat on the patio which was nice.
We would go again."}
{"text":"This is our Italian go to. We missed good Italian after moving down from the north so we were very happy to have found Mama Ricotta's. The cheese pizza and penne a la vodka are our faves. The service is always great. Last night, Ben gave us a great wine recommendation and was so attentive to our table. Our water and wine glasses never got low. He was super sweet and helpful!"}
{"text":"Trying to find a decent Italian place with parking for uptown meetings is sometimes tough, but you need look no further than Mama Ricotta's. An excellent location for good locale Italian food that has fantastic service and parking. Make sure to check it out!"}
{"text":"Good Italian dishes but lots of garlic. Smells good when you walk in the door.  Usually crowded."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Italian restaurants. We love the penne ala vodka with chicken and shrimp and the bruschetta is the best I have ever had. Their tomatoes are so fresh. We also love their garlic rolls that are complimentary. It's hard to stop eating them...lol. Prices are reasonable considering the portion sizes. Two people can eat off one entree."}
{"text":"This is not what qualifies as \"Good Italian.\" 

Perhaps there is an Italian village where this is identical to what they serve, but I have never been there. I've never been to Italy at all. 

So I'll say this instead: This is not what qualifies as \"Good Italian American.\"

I've enjoyed Mama Ricotta's catering before, and even dinner several times over the last decade. But tonight, despite not having to pay, having two glasses of Chianti, and having the gal at the bar give me her phone number, I was disappointed. 

Jamal served us with precision and a smile. One busboy was nice enough to crumble bread on my jacket, then look down at my jacket as if its presence offended him.

The rolls...these are dinner rolls, coated in oil. They stiffened within minutes, which generally says they spent time in a microwave. 

The oily rolls also came with a dish full of oil. A dish of oil is a decent gesture in most Italian restaurants, but this oil was spicy. And more spicy than I prefer. But if you are from that Italian village where they dip oily rolls in spicy oil, this is your place. 

The highly recommended Warm Goat Cheese and Mascarpone Dip was pleasant tasting. Rich marinara surrounding creamy mascarpone, with bread of proper consistency. In fact, I wish they served a version of this bread as their dinner bread. The presentation could be better. Looked like a dying sunflower made of bread.

For the main course, I chose Pasta Primavera. While flavorful, and a big heaping plate, this was also heavy laden in oil. A deep pool of oil.

My benefactor ordered angel hair pasta with tomato basil sauce plus shrimp. She appeared pleased, although this may have had more to do with the man across from her, or her drink, or both. 

Or neither."}
{"text":"Looking for a good lunch stop? Try Mama Ricotta's. It's in a convenient location just south of Uptown or just outside the Dilworth area...perfect for a quick business lunch. I think other people have the same idea because there were a lot of business-dressed patrons filling every seat.

If you plan on talking to secure that business deal, sit outside (as long as the weather is accommodating). It's rather loud and difficult to hear your party indoors and I found myself smiling and nodding across the way without really knowing what my colleague was saying half the time (shhh, don't tell).

The food was good...not spectacular. The salmon that comes on the salad is of large proportion. The sandwiches actually looked the best out of all the dishes at our table! I had the capellini pomodoro with the tomato basil sauce...okay. The rolls were rolls...not french bread, but were good. 

I'll give it another try because other Yelpers have had such a good experience here...and perhaps I'll order one of their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Seriously one of my favorite Charlotte eateries. If you love Italian food, you'll love this Mama. The food is fresh and the calamari is delicious. My favorite dish is the penne, chicken broccoli. The lasagne is wonderful, too."}
{"text":"I crave Mama Ricottas! What a great place. Went tonight for my birthday dinner and it was delicious as always. The servers are always sharp and on point, salads are cold and pastas are piping hot. I had penne alla vodka (because I can't get that sauce right in my own kitchen!), my date had spinach fettuccine and his Alfredo sauce was light and delicious without being overly garlicky and thick as is the case some other places. Shrimp was juicy and perfect- also a struggle some other places (and in my kitchen... :) ) Tiramisu was perfect for dessert and enough to share. Manager Laura stopped by to check on our experience and she was lovely, as was our server and food delivery staff. Thanks Mama's!"}
{"text":"Came in on a busy Saturday night. Our server Tangee(?) was amazing!! Fast friendly service. I could tell she was tied up with other tables, at the same time, she still gave us great personal attention. I asked for a wine pair. She was right on point!! She consulted the bartenders. And bam! perfect wine appeared at our table. Matt (manager) came and said \"hi\". Professional and friendly man. Absolutely perfect experience. Oh. And the food was the top of the line quality and the portions were perfect (the boyfriend and I eat A LOT!). If you're looking for a good place to sit, eat and be flattered. Come on by!!"}
{"text":"This place is yummy! My fiancé and I came here for dinner one night. He got the lasagna and I got the ravioli. My ravioli was so good- the perfect amount of meat sauce and cheese, I wish I could've gotten a bigger portion lol. My fiancé liked his lasagna as well- but I think he liked my ravioli more. Also the waitress was very helpful in helping me figure out which sauce I should get on my ravioli, which I really appreciated. I will be coming back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I love Mama Ricottas!! This place has been around for ages and I hardly ever come anymore but it's still just as yummy as ever!! I pretty much always get either the lasagna or the Polo Romano neither dish ever fails me and it's Italian comfort food at its finest. This is a great place for a group or to celebrate a birthday etc. Now I will say this.. If you are looking for wow factor, new innovated foods, hopping social place then this won't be for you. However if you are looking for that neighborhood staple restaurant with good comfort level food and a good staff to match then please give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food. As close to home cooking as it comes and service was fantastic. Food came out very fast. Sat out on the patio and enjoyed the views of the city. Had chicken park family size, included 5 pieces of chicken parmigiana and a side of angel hair pasta that was enough for 5 or more people. Had a very good wine selection. Recommend making a reservation but even as a walk in we were seated very fast. Absolutely worth the visit. Feed 4 people and took leftovers home for tomorrow."}
{"text":"Recently moved down here from Long Island, New York.

I had a great local pizza place near my house that made some tasty dishes as well as pies.

Oh, boy do I miss that establishment... and New York Deli's, I wish they existed down here. Why can't I find a damn deli that puts bacon, egg, and cheese on a damn \"kaiser like\" roll? Is it the kaiser part? It's not a freaking nazi roll... Jiminy.

Anyway, I digress.

I was looking around on yelp to find a highly rated Italian place that also served family sized dishes so I could pick up takeout for me, the wife, and kids. 

My children are too young to trust that they will not bother other patrons with their \"annoyingness\"...


This place seemed great! We ordered the PENNE, BROCCOLI & CHICKEN and the GOAT CHEESE & MASCARPONE DIP.

Zero complaints about the dip other than most of the bread we were given was burnt. Gave those to the kids and dog... Doubt they'd notice.

The pasta dish was one of, if not, THE worst pasta entrees I have ever ordered.

I can not recall a single time that I have ordered pasta and it was a mushy over cooked travesty like this was...

Flavor was decent, lemon=yum, but the pasta tasted like it was cooking for the entire 35 minutes that we were told it would take to complete the order. I don't care about words like \"Al Dente\" as long as the pasta does not taste like it has been cooking for days!!

I literally had to \"cook\" and add salt, pepper, and melted mozzarella under my broiler so we could eat it and I still ended up throwing some out.

For over $45, I expected more. The kids ate some of it so I guess that is something...

If you don't care or have never had properly cooked pasta, then, it is edible.

If you wanted something awesome worth your repeated business then, for me at least, I'd need some proof they could cook pasta right.

I likely will not give them another chance cause the pasta was really that bad.

This is the first review I have ever done cause I have never ordered from an Italian place that couldn't cook pasta properly. I hope this was just a one off but for the cost of admission... I cannot really afford to find out.

So disappointing :("}
{"text":"The food gets 4 stars ... The service gets 6 stars. Our waiter was that legit.
Authentic Italian food! The Chicken Parmesan was amazing! I definitely would recommend heading here!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended Mama Ricotta's and said it was better than Aria. This restaurant is totally different compared Aria.

Mama Ricotta is a family style restaurant for they have different sized portions from small, full to family on certain dishes.

Thank you Yelper's for suggesting the Warm Goat Cheese & Mascarpone dip. It was really good.

As for the entrees, we ordered the Sauteed Beef Tenderloin & Creamy Wild Mushroom Risotto & Linguine with Clams.

The entrees were okay. Nothing out of the ordinary. The Risotto was cooked with so much butter. Have had better Italian food than this. The is Americanized Italian Food.

Our waiter, Eric who was new was very attentive. Every time we looked around he came over to see if everything was okay. The manager came over to double check if everything was okay for we had an issue with one of the wines.

The meals came out so fast. While were eating the appetizer, the salads came out. I was still eating my meal when they placed the check on the table. Felt like we were in a diner back in NYC."}
{"text":"All time favorite Italian restaurant in Charlotte! We love eating at the pizza bar and always have top notch service. Additionally, they serve the best gluten free pasta around! I recommend the penne, broccoli and chicken with sausage!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here once when I was staying at a hotel in downtoen Charlotte for work. I found it on yelp and looked like they had some delicious menu items and were also close to where I was staying. I always try new places that are not chains and this one had lots of items I was interested in. 

I looked at the menu and ended up ordering the goat cheese and mascropone appetizer that you also got with crostini and marinera sauce, The salmon salad, and also the apple crisp dessert. When I called to order the person who took my order was very helpful and knew a lot about the menu items which almost never happens. Since I also ordered take out she made sure to tell me that everything would be packaged seperately so it would not get soggy. 

When I picked up my food it was so nicely packed and delicious as well! I loved all of the food and would defnitely love to go back there again. Definitely a nice place to just go and have a quiet dinner with some friends. The wine and beer selection was pretty great as well!"}
{"text":"So fine...so good...every time with everything.

I broke my habit by not ordering the wonderlishous lasagne and opted for the vodka penne.  Superb.  Wife had a special:  tubes with a short rib ragu which was extraordinary and very rich.  

Yes, we were stuffed so left with two cartons that WE WILL CONSUME FOR BREAKFAST tomorrow.   Haaaa, haaaa, ha.

Ben gave us a sense of humor with his excellent service, so typical of Mama's.

If you haven't been, go.  And go early for any meal as it is popular and gets pretty busy fast.

Yumalishous to the max."}
{"text":"I have to preface with the fact that I'm not a huge fan of Italian food.

I was unimpressed with the customer service: the server was apparently not typically on the floor as she was the bartender. My first question is \"Why?\" She got our order incorrect (which actually ended up being a good thing) but was a bit slow.  I usually like all salads but I did NOT like the chopped salad. For some reason, the acidity was too high and some of the flavors did not bode well together.  

My friends raved about the Nutella pie: it was good but it was much more like a Cheesecake Factory cheesecake slice than a pie: huge and don't order more than one per table--too much. For dinner, we ordered the Pollo Bianco and since we both wanted it, we decided for family style. The family style doesn't come with side dishes so you have to order those separately--so we did. But then they brought the single serving and still brought the sides--and the single serving is served on top of mashed potatoes: one of the sides we ordered. Enter double sides of mashed potatoes. I will say the sauce of the chicken was good, but the mashed potatoes were the same as anywhere else. 

I guess it's just another standard chain restaurant. Too bad. It could have been so much more."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed a wonderful dinner. We started our meal with yummy cocktails. Our waiter Giavani was great. We enjoyed the beef tenderloin medallions, chicken parm and spaghetti. Everything was well seasoned and delivered quickly to our table. 
We will definitely will return."}
{"text":"This place is great. Jelani was our server and he was awesome. My wife's lasagna was terrific. The only reason not a 5 was my veal was a little over cooked. Great Italian joint."}
{"text":"I've been going to Mamas' for years. The food is always consistently good. Very good wine list. The little garlic knots (that come with every entrée) melt in your mouth. The ONLY negative is slow service at times. They are always packed so, maybe that's it."}
{"text":"I really debated on how many stars to give. If I could I would have given 3.5. I came here for lunch and I was pleased, not blown away but happy. The decor in some aspects is cool but in others it could use some updating. You can tell they have probably made some changes over the years but not all the ones they need to. Our waitress was super sweet and friendly which was also another plus. 
They bring bread and oil yo start when you sit down. The bread is actually rolls which I found disappointing, it's served with a slightly spicy oil. We had the goat cheese snd mascarpone dip with marinara and it was delicious. The goat cheese was present but not overwhelming. It comes with toast but I wish it had been served with something more bite size such as crostini etc. I should also mention that we came during lunch time and not dinner so we didn't have the whole menu to pick from. I had the angel hair pasta with tomato basil sauce and it was good, I was happy with it. My husband ordered the penne with vodka sauce and it was also delicious, it had some spice to it as well. I like spice but for some it may have been too much. 
I would eat here again it would not go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing. Great staff, great food. They never disappoint. Do yourself a favor and get the goat cheese app and the Nutella pie. You don't even have to order anything else and you will walk out happy b"}
{"text":"Advertised as New Haven pizza. We are from the New Haven area relocated in Huntersville, NC. It's not Traditional New Haven pizza. The people were extremely nice, the service was great and it was a very busy Saturday evening. If you're going to try the pie make sure you ask for it crispy. Must admit we didn't try the reg food. I think we will so I'll get back to you. Stars are strictly based on the pizza."}
{"text":"I love Italian food, and I love Mama Ricotta's, so that should tell you something.
Mama's (as my friend's call it) is kind of unassuming, placed as it is in a strip mall-type of place.
The restaurant itself isn't very large, which can make for some crowded times during dinner and, somewhat surprisingly, lunch.

The food is outstanding however. The pasta is homemade, and the garlic knots are a must. I am a big fan of the angel hair and the lasagna.

Some dishes may be a bit pricey, but at least you are getting quality for your money. 

If you are an Italian fan and a bit tired of the chain restaurants such as Olive Garden and Carabba's, you should take a chance and check out Mama's."}
{"text":"Came into town for the Belk Bowl. Based on previous reviews me and my boyfriend chose this place and we weren't disappointed! We shared the chicken oreganata pizza and it was wonderful! Also had a side salad with their homemade creamy Gorgonzola dressing which was good too. 

Easy to find and parking available. It's a little dressy which I wasn't prepared for in my Dawg sweatshirt. :) but good and affordable. Go if you get the chance!"}
{"text":"Found my new go to for Italian.  Food is top notch and the service is excellent.  My waiter David was outstanding and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Most of the time when I come here it is for lunch. I have been to dinner once or twice. For the most part my review is based around my experiences for lunch. 

I have been coming here since around 2007 and never had one bad experience. It can get a little busy so getting there for a early or late lunch is better than right at lunch time. Staff has always been excellent and never had an issue with the kitchen messing up any food. 

I tend to enjoy the calzone of the day. They are always fresh and taste great if you like the goodies that are on the inside that day. The lasagna has always been great as well. The bread has always been good too. 

Long story short great food and great people at lunch and the few dinner experiences were great too! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here that many times, but I got take out last weekend and it was awesome.  I got the chicken in lemon sauce with grilled artichokes which came with creamy polenta and a veggie (it happened to be cauliflower on that day)- not only was the food fantastic, but it was enough for me to eat two fulls meals.  I also got the side salad which came with a really great homade sundried tomato dressing (also the salad was under $3 which you don't find anywhere these days).  My boyfriend had the penne with meat sauce which he liked, but his portion was noticably smaller than mine- I think the meat entrees are prob a better deal.  The entire meal came with half a dozen garlic rolls, on the house.  Oh, beware that if you go on the weekends this place is packed- I could barely get to the bar to get my to go order."}
{"text":"First time I went we had a large party of 10, of which 3 were stuck in traffic.  We told them this and they seated us anyway.  We called them knowing they were a few miuntes or better away.  We ordered drinks and food for them.  About 5 minutes later the hostess who sat us came back and started trying to talk us into squeezing into a table for 6.  I told her they were down the street and we had just ordered for them so there was no reason to switch.  She said there was another large party that was all here .... Just then the rest of our group showed up.  If they had not I would have left.  The server and the food that night were great and almost made me forget about the hostess.  Then we came again with some friends raving about the food.  Must have been a new chef.  The service was still great but EVERYTHING was really salted. The pizza, the calamari, the pasta. 3 of us ordered a home made pasta with portabello mushrooms, it was so salty we could not eat it. The waitress tried so hard, she apologized and even offered us a free tira misu for desert. Sorry to say cause the servers are great, but Mama's is off our list."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Service is extraordinary & it's very obvious that food is fresh and top notch.  Prices are extremely reasonable also.  Some of our favorites are the penne alla vodka & the rigatoni with meet sauce.  We were just recently in for my birthday dinner & we also received a complimentary cannoli for the occasion!"}
{"text":"We ask for our children's food first thing so they could start eating sooner and the waitress put their order with the adults so they were starving and getting fuzzy. I found a hair in my bread and they just offered more bread (without hairs), they offered the special chicken Parmesan calzone and 20 min later they said they didn't have it anymore so we had to order another pizza and wait another 30 mins to get everybody's food. We didn't get any discount for the wait or the hair in the bread or the long time we had to wait to get our food. Food was delicious but really bad service :(
Very disappointed and I don't think we'll come back
It was the first and the last time we are going there."}
{"text":"Food was really good and they have a great wine selection.  I will say we got there at 6:45 and the place was already packed full and the bar too.  Had to stand around for a bit.  Just my husband and I so we have some wine, waited for our table and had a really good time just of the two of us.  Great for date night, little crazy with a group of people."}
{"text":"It was my first time there. I was with a group and we didn't wait long to be seated. It was a wonderful atmosphere. The food was amazing and great portion size. I will come again."}
{"text":"One of mine and my husband's favorite restaurants! We come here for most birthdays and some date nights. The bruschetta with house-made mozzarella cheese is to die for. I love the lasagna and my husband always orders the Chicken Parm. The Nutella Pie is super rich but is delicious!"}
{"text":"I can not say how much I LOVED my meal here tonight! Everything from the service (Matt was great), to the app, meal, and atmosphere was top notch. By a mile the best Italian restaurant in Charlotte if not the best restaurant all together. I had the lasagna as my main meal and every bite was delicious. When I eat out I always expectations that 90% of the time are not met. This was the 2nd time I've eaten here and both times they knocked it out of the park. I can't believe you can get such great food for such a great price. I highly recommend given this place a try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"5:13 at night, place is 3/4 empty but they can't seat us. I wonder if it because me and my wife are tattooed undesirables that don't fit in with their clientele?

Either way,  you have 20 open tables and you are only willing to sit us if we sit outside? 

I know where I am not welcome.  So if you are under 70 and not quite the old white Christian ideal... maybe you would want to find a different place to spend your money? 

I guess I don't really have a choice."}
{"text":"So, went here because of the reviews...as its so hard to decide on an Italian restaurant in Charlotte, and it did not disappoint. My husband and I shared the family size Rigatoni with Meat Sauce, and listen to me when I say ...ADD the homemade ricotta. If you like ricotta whatsoever...it is fantastic. We had enough food for both of us and a little to take home for leftovers. We also ordered some type of cheese bread, without realizing they give you complimentary bread...so it was bread overload, but who can complain about that? We did not drink alcohol, but it seemed like they had a generous wine selection. For a great meal on date night we probably spent around 40 bucks or less....so very affordable!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for Italian the other night and came here with my girlfriend.  Glad that we made a reservation as things were hopping on a Saturday night - had to push through several waiting parties to get in the door!  We had expected a bit more upscale decor, so we were both a bit overdressed - place is very casual and nothing special to look at.  We were both hungry and ordered quickly - I went for a glass of Malbec, house salad (which is a smaller portion of Mama's salad), and the pasta special, a sea bass served over linguine.  Girlfriend got a glass of Riesling, house salad, and clams over spaghetti.  We munched on the garlic rolls (served warm, with olive oil and red pepper, and you can get more if you ask the waiter nicely).  Food was good and hearty, and we both were full by the time the plates were taken away.  Flavor was typical of Ametican Italian - heavier sauces, lots of garlic - and pastas were nice and chewy (pasta is not made in house).  We got the tiramisu for dessert which was typical American- style tiramisu (large, lots of creme, not super flavorful on the coffee side).  Total came to ~$70 (before tip).  Would definitely go back (wanted to try the pizza), but this place is not quite up to your NYC / Boston North End Italian standard."}
{"text":"Once again mama ricottas killed it with their food but tonight, waitresses chandler and Laura Ashley took care of my party of 18 like each of us had our own personal waitresses! Every order was correct, drinks were always refilled and we didn't have to ask for anything! Great work! Exceptional food combined w exceptional service make for a wonderful dinner!"}
{"text":"Incredible Food and service, we agreed it was one of the Best dinners we've had in CHarlotte.  The location and building are very misleading, the food and staff are top notch."}
{"text":"We attended a planned birthday party of 25 people. I was surprised at how well it worked...from the delicious food to the exceptional service. Our main servers Cori and Abby were prompt with taking drink orders as we arrived. As soon as we all arrived and were seated, the salad course was served. Demands for bread refills were met with a swift response. As soon as the salad plates were cleared, our pasta course arrived. And before we could recover from that course, the tasty meat course arrived. Our experienced servers knew to anticipate our need for coffee in preparation for the final dessert course. 

Maybe my multiple trips to Italy create a level of expectation higher than reasonable. The penne pasta with creamy pesto sauce was disappointing and not up-to-par with their other dishes...I've had better from Pizza Hut. The alternate pasta dish (cream sauce, broccoli and penne) was excellent.

All were impressed by how well our large party was managed. There were many opportunities when there could have been hiccups in the service or our dinner could have been uncomfortably long. If I had to select a couple of words to describe the service...I'd choose \"professional\" and \"polished\". I'd definitely recommend this venue to anyone planning a large dinner event."}
{"text":"Had the lasagna was very good would recommend wife and son said the same Geoffrey was the waiter great personal  service"}
{"text":"We ate here a few weeks ago, and I'm still thinking about the goat cheese and mascarpone dip.  If you could read my mind, that statement would speak for itself, but since you can't (I hope), let me tell you what you're missing if you haven't experienced this appetizer yet.  This is not like any sort of cheesy dip you might have had before.  This is a warm scoop of creamy, delicious cheese covered in marinara sauce, served with perfectly toasted bread.  The challenge here is to get just the right proportion of cheese and sauce in every bite.  We finished off the toast and were still scraping the bowl with bread from the bread basket, which is freshly baked in-house.  I don't even like goat cheese very much, but this blend of cheeses was just right.

I also had the angel hair with tomato basil sauce, which was perfectly done.  The sauce really has to stand out in a simple dish like this, and this sauce was up to the task.  I think next time, though, I might try something a little more complex--maybe the cheese ravioli."}
{"text":"We went to dinner without a reservation and were seated right away.  We ordered a large White Pizza and added mushrooms with a side of Alfredo for dipping the crusts.  Their food is wonderful and everything tastes scratch made and authentic.  Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a nice place to have a great meal!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!! My servers name was Kim, and she was attentive and really added to our dining experience. Would definitely recommend on a Wednesday for half priced bottles!"}
{"text":"Maybe one of the worst experiences at a restaurant. The only seating was outside on the side patio. So they brought us out to a table that was sitting directly in the sun at the end of June! We tried to sit and enjoy our food, while our waitress was not very concerned about us, and the bugs just came flying in. Flies all over my pasta, sweating perfusely, and the manager came to see how we were doing and we immediately boxed up our food a left. They should never seat people directly in the sun or outside in the middle of summer with no ventilation on the patio. The food is pretty basic. No flavor and no seasoning. Go to Dolce Restorante instead."}
{"text":"This is one of my FAVORITE Italian restaurants in Charlotte. REAL Italian food, great pasta, and great pizza!! They are huge portions of food with good prices. I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"Super great first time experience. Karen and Beth are just delightful.. Great Conversation, Great Food and Drinks! I can't wait to come back and enjoy a great dinner here."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely phenomenal! The family sized caprese appetizer was the biggest We've ever been served (one of our staples). Great wine selection also. Do not let the exterior appearance or the plaza deter you. We had a great meal and will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here based on reviews and my wife and I were not disappointed.  The food was better than the well known national Italian chain and the prices were less - you can't beat that.  The lasagna was to die for - best I have had out."}
{"text":"Is it me or has this place gone downhill?!?! I've been a mamma Ricottas fan since day 1. But today what I picked up for takeout was a real disappointment. I ordered a full mama's salad and added chicken for an up charge. It looked like half the amount of chicken as usual half of which was gristle and/or skin. 2 I added extra olive and artichoke hearts which was another up charge (which they didn't tell me it would cost extra) but there weren't extra of either. 3 I got extra dressings and were charged for those as well and they weren't even correct. For the price point of this restaurant I'd expect them to get orders correct and to tell me if something I ordered had an extra charge. Just really disappointed in what used to be one of my favorite Charlotte restaurants"}
{"text":"Where do I began today I had a phenomenal dinner at Mama Ricotta's my server Hayley C was the absolute BEST her food suggestions and attentiveness was STELLAR! I had the Bresaola and the Lasagna (A-M-A-Z-I-N-G). If your ever in the area you must come here and you have to ask for Hayley C. I WILL be back again and I hope she's my server! Thank you Mama Ricotta's for providing such amazing authentic Italian food!!!!!  phenomenal"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday evening for our anniversary and it was busy. Server was okay but a little too laid back. We ordered a goat cheese app that was very good. Our entrees were chicken marsala(good) and a chianti-braised short rib over gnocchi (very tasteless). My bloody mary was also about the worst I have ever had. On a positive note, the chocolate torte with cannoli cream was out of this world.I dont know if we will go back."}
{"text":"Friendly waitstaff, quick service, and great food! I tried the angel hair pasta with vegetables and tomato-cream sauce. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Mama Ricotta's is an Italian joint that seems to be pretty popular with the locals.  I was there with a large group (work) so I got to try a lot of items (but no pictures).  We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share: Tomato and Mozzarella,  Calamari, Chopped Salad, Bruschetta.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  I particularly loved the Chopped Salad.  It had a lot going on, with many ingredients, but it really worked. 

For a Main I ordered the Roasted Grouper.  I did not care for the way the fish was prepared. The fish was served with stewed beans, kale, guanicale, and butternut squash. I thought that sounded interesting but I did not like it at all. I did try some of my team mates's dishes. The Chicken Romano was very good. However, the star of the night was the Chianti Braised Short Rib....so tender and flavorful!  We also shared two desserts, a bread pudding and a Nutella pie. Both were sinfully delicious!  

The portions were huge!  You can order individual or family size portions. We ordered individual but the portions were large enough to share!  Service was very attentive. They honored our reservation , and our food came out very quickly, especially considering we were a group of ten. Great place to take a group or family!"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. David was outstanding waiter and was very attentive. Will definitely be back for a weekend out."}
{"text":"Yummm Mama Ricotta's! One of my best friends worked here during my first years of college so logically (with the food discounts and everything), we would come here for lunch or dinner a lot. If I could fall in love with a restaurant, it'd be true love between  me and Mama Ricotta's. Apparently a lot of others feel the same way so maybe Mama's is cheating on me. Oh well. I'll tolerate it this time- I'm still in that infatuated stage and I don't think it's ending any time soon. I always have a ton of options here and everything is always absolutely perfect. I usually hate eating pasta with only tomato sauce and no grated cheese, but I was forced to try their angel hair pasta with tomato basil sauce WITHOUT parmesan cheese and it was perfect. I was truly amazed. Who knew tomato sauce could be so good that you don't need or even WANT cheese?! And the tiramisu? In the past, I've personally described it as the equivalent of a tiramisu-flavored cloud. Perfect texture, perfect combination of flavors and perfect density. Best tiramisu 've ever had by far.

However, with that said, I am bummed about two things. First off, their Mama's Pasta is NOT on the  menu anymore. Apparently they can still make it, but it's by special request only. Also, the tiramisu has been lacking in cloud-like quality the last two times I've gone in to eat. It could be that I'm just getting the last slice of it or maybe they just changed their recipe. Either way, I've been slightly disappointed. Hopefully it'll be back to the same thing next time I go. *fingers crossed*"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews I was very excited to try this restaurant. My wife and I decided to eat here for our 21st anniversary. First, the good. The service was excellent. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive. Second, the house made mozzarella was delicious. My wife had the dinner special that was an angel hair pasta dish with cream, ham and peas. She really enjoyed it. Now the bad. I had the grouper. The grouper was a small (obviously frozen) filet over a medley of beans, veggies and kale. The fish was small, thin and bland. The vegetables were significantly over cooked. The dish was $24 and in all honesty it was not as good as a piece of baked/broiled fish from Captain Dees or Long John Silver. I had to put a lot of salt and pepper on the fish as it was just so bland. 
Normally I would have no issue sending the food back or telling the server about my dissatisfaction but it was our anniversary and my wife was really enjoying her dinner so I kept mum and ate my fish. 
Bottom line for me, when in an Italian restaurant go for a menu item they specialize in but I didn't mention I am not physically able to eat pasta so if I go back it will definitely be a salad dinner for me."}
{"text":"Mama Ricotta's did an excellent job serving our department for our Christmas luncheon. We have about 30 people and they were able to secure an area in the back for us. The servers were very attentive,  friendly and quick. 

Our meal was served family style and we had a pre-set menu. The bruschetta was our appetizer.  The tomatoes and basil were fresh on top of a slice of garlic toast. My bread was a tiny bit soggy so this one needed to be eaten quickly. Then we had the Tuscan salad. The house made mozzarella in this salad is to die for. 

For our main course, we had turkey prosciutto meatballs, rigatoni with meat sauce, penne,broccoli and chicken, and pasta primavera. The meatballs are huge, like almost as big as my fist. They have a good Italian meatball flavor and you forget It's actually made with turkey. All of the pastas were amazing, each with a different flavor. My favorite was the rigatoni with meat sauce. It had an amazing tomato flavor infused with seasoned meat and the pasta was cooked just right. 

My ultimate favorite dish here is the penne alla vodka which we did not have. Most of the time I come just for the penne alla vodka and never try anything else. So it was great to try other foods here. 

And again hats off to the staff. They even worked around us playing games between activities."}
{"text":"Best, most authentic Italian ever?  Well, perhaps not.  Dang good, dang unhealthy Americanized Italian?  Yes, indeed.

Ok, people... if you're going to a place named \"Mama Ricotta's,\" you shouldn't be expecting it to be terribly authentic.  But it is much better than Olive Garden.  The food is horrible for you, but delicious.  On our first visit, I had the tortellini special, which really impressed me.  The little pastas were perfectly cheesy, and the meat sauce was amazing.  It actually had little chunks of steak in it instead of ground beef.  My mouth is watering as I write this review, honestly.

The only part of the experience that was less than ideal was the goat cheese appetizer.  It came highly recommended, and it was tasty, but it lacked tanginess.  I probably wouldn't have been as let down if my expectations had not been so high.

Mama Ricotta's is comfort.  Good ol' Americanized comfort.  Mmm."}
{"text":"Mama Ricotta's is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte and one of the best Italian restaurants in the QC. Their food is delicious and I've always had positive experiences there. Try not to fill up on the bread, even though it's really tempting. I'm a devoted fan of their lasagna, though all the pasta is good. Their pizzas are good and a cheaper route to take for dinner at Mama Ricotta's. I always leave feeling full but with plenty of leftovers to eat the next day for lunch.

It's a great spot for group gatherings too. My office had its Christmas party here last year."}
{"text":"Four great meals with great service. Loved my chopped salad and special-of-the-day shrimp linguini in a sherry cream sauce."}
{"text":"Table for 1 tonight and the service was impeccable from the hostess to my server/bartender Ally. Mozzarella & tomato appetizer was ample, fresh and yummy. My Pizza was hot, because she waited for me to start my app before ordering, and very good. Ally was especially nice to everyone who approached the bar area...very even. I'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"My Husband and I dined her Saturday Evening for our Anniversary and we are still talking about it. We got there early and it filled up FAST.  A mix of couples and families.  The atmosphere is romantic and the service is top notch.  We started with a house made fresh mozzarella snuggled between thick slices of vine-ripened tomatoes, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and fresh basil.  It came with roasted red peppers and pine nuts.  The cheese was so fresh and delicious!!  We split a bottle of chianti that was very tasty for only $30.  Our pasta dishes came out amazing.  True and authentic Italian food!!!  Our waiter surprised us with a cannoli that had a candle in it and it was the tastiest one I ever had.  Coming from an Italian NY chick, that is saying a lot!!  We will try to go once a month for date night.  Probably my favorite restaurant in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Scrumptious. Got a personal pizza with gorgonzola, chicken sausage, and red onions. Red sangria was good too."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Good service. I ordered the carbonara. It was very heavy. I couldn't take more than a couple bites because it was too rich and overpowering. It was hard to enjoy. I would maybe come back but I do not recommend the carbonara."}
{"text":"Based on my first experience at Mama Ricotta's they deserve a 5 from beginning to end. The restaurant is nice and clean and very spacious with perfect lighting. The servers and staff were all friendly and professional. 

The complimentary bread which is a good indication of how the rest of the meal with be was delicious and they'll gladly bring you more. I went with the Tonarelli Carbonara which was excellent! It doesn't seem like sufficient pasta but it's enough, believe me. 

We also ordered the Tonarelli Pesto Shrimp which was also excellent! You can tell they really know what they're doing in the kitchen. 

For dessert we enjoyed possibly the best bread pudding we've ever had! No,  I'm serious! 

I would absolutely recommend this restaurant when you're craving some authentic Italian"}
{"text":"I really liked the pizza here and having looked over the reviews and the suggestions made by the YELPERS here in Charlotte the wife and I checked it out and are pleased to say, I believe for now (only because we have not tried all pizza joints) have found our favorite pizza and the staff was awesome. Chris the manager even came out at the end of dinner to see how things were and how did the meal go. 

The fresh bread with Olive oil and red Pepper flakes was very good, we had the Chicken Garginzol...LOL...Something pizza and it was awesome, it does come with a lot of onions, just FYI

We are already planning on going back and having some pasta...

Let me say Krista was a very attentive and helpful server and we Thank her for her input.

Grazie, Mama Ricotta's"}
{"text":"I've waited far too long to update my review, having had nothing but excellent experiences here over the past few years. Today's lunch was no exception - my salad was delightful and beyond basic even though it was \"just\" a side salad, and my pasta (Penne Broccoli & Chicken) was rich and delicious. Service was wonderful as well."}
{"text":"I don't say this lightly, and I'm surprised I'm saying this at all.

This is actually the best Italian food I had EVER (and that counts Italy as well). It was hearty, flavorful and the service was simply fantastic. It tasted like they made quite a few things on site too.

The menu was also manageable (unlike some Italian places). My favorite is how you can order items family style. Everything was delicious through and through from the appetizers (goat cheese is a plus) to the cannoli. 

The drinks specials were also delicious (I came when Mama-citas were the special)."}
{"text":"AMAZING italian food. Will continue to come back here when I am in town.  Love the service and environment. I ordered the spinach fettuccine carbonara and it was fantastic. The made from scratch pasta just took the dish over the top. Highly recommend trying this dish in particular."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to eat here for a while, based on friends and other Yelpers. Boy am I glad I finally did. 

Took an out of town friend here for lunch Saturday. Sat outside as it was a beautiful day. Early on in the lunch of waiter, \"Derrick\", accidentally knocked a glass of water on my friends lap. Us being pretty laid back, no big deal. Well Derrick took it very seriously apologizing multiple times, gave us a free goat cheese app, which was as good as it was unexpected. And then proceeded to tell us a story about how he dumped a glass of wine on a guys head early on in his waiting experience. He turned a potential disaster lunch, into one of the best I have had.

Now onto the food, all around incredible!! Goat cheese app, fantastic. I got braised beef veg, soup, it was excellent. Had the pasta of the day which was grouper and salmon over spaghetti in a diablo sauce. Also very good. \"Mamas pasta\" with pesto went over very well with my friend. 

I can't wait to get back and try the \"New Haven\" style pizza, as I grew up in New Haven, and am VERY picky about my pizza!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place a few weeks ago and absolutely loved it! The warm goat cheese appetizer is to DIE for! My husband ordered the pizza with in house made chicken sausage and was in love! I had the cheese ravioli and it was delicious. We will definitely be going back. Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very disappointed as I've heard wonderful things about Mama Ricottas. We ordered the lasagna and carbonara to go. The sauce was broken and flavorless in the carbonara. Plus the portion size was tiny. The lasagna was over cooked and made it extremely chewy. I'm only giving two stars because the staff was friendly and polite. Sorry to say I won't be back and still in search of a good Italian restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Oh my, oh my... the delish goodness!  Went there for my final meal of 2010 and what a culinary treat!  The restaurant was quite busy on New Year's Eve; however, hostess and wait staff was accommodating and attentive.  

A special holiday menu was provided, and I dined on Agnello Farcito - leg of lamb stuffed with Romano cheese and fresh parsley, gently braised in rich tomato sauce with olive oil mashed potatoes and braised black kale.  The lamb was very tender, sliced from the bone, rolled, and stuffed... what's not to like with that presentation?  I substituted Fontina risotto for the olive oil mashed potatoes... perfectly cooked, creamy, and just-enough cheesy.  And, I also opted for the asparagus over the braised black kale... wise choice on my part!  Portion was decent and filling enough that I took one of the lamb rolls home in order to save room for dessert!  And, while I had heard tall mouthwatering tales of their bread pudding, I ordered the Oreo Pie instead since it was only available that night for the special menu, and since plans of a return visit during 2011 were already dancing in my head!  Please believe this decadence was some kind of wonderful!!! The pastry chef should make it into heaven based on this creation alone... thick Oreo cookie crumb layer topped with cheesecake layer, chocolate ganache, sponge cake layer, more ganache, and caramel.  Oh baby, it was saying, \"Come to mama,\" with each layer of scrumptious decadence, and I went willingly with full abandon!!!  

Absolutely a great dining experience!   I will be back soon to partake of the regular menu, that's not-so-regular, and won't think of leaving without having the bread pudding next time!"}
{"text":"Awesome meal - flavorful food, large portions, not overly expensive.  The Marscapone dip was outstanding and the bread pudding dessert was one if the best I've had!  Go and enjoy the gluttony!"}
{"text":"Mama Ricotta's has some of the most authentic Italian food in Charlotte. There aren't a lot of little hole-in-the-wall Italian places like Mama Ricotta's around these parts, so it was a wonderful day for me when I found this spot.

The goat cheese and marscapone dip should probably be illegal, as it's obscene and addictive and insanely delicious. The ravioli alla Fiorintina is one of my favorites from the pasta menu, as well as the penne alla vodka (hold the pancetta for me). 

I've never had bad food at Mama's, and I can be kind of a snot about Italian food. I studied abroad in Florence just to be able to be an Italian food snob and to pronounce things elegantly off Italian menus...I'm still paying for the privilege every month!

It can get a little crowded, but if you've got the time, it's well-worth the wait."}
{"text":"The food and service here was terrific. The hostess was  very nice and accommodating with my daughters wheelchair.  
I tried their meatballs and their lasagna and they were both very good.  My wife and I would both give their salads (chopped and house salad both) a 10. 
We had the teramisu for dessert and it was delicious.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The classic Italian dishes here are delicious. I tried the cheese ravioli and the lasagna - neither disappoint! I also tried the pizza which was more average IMO and the crust wasn't as thin/crispy as I would have liked. Moral of the story - stick to the basics! Be warned: the Nutella pie dessert is HUGE so order with caution. My only other entirely personal complaint is that I wish they had a tortellini dish with the family recipe! Overall, I would definitely go back. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"We had lunch reservations on a Sunday afternoon and were seated as soon as we walked in. Service as well as the food was beyond belief good. The blood orange sangria has to be one of the best white wine sangrias I've ever had. $6 each on a Sunday or maybe everyday you can't beat especially for the size pour!! We also tried the $6 mimosa which was just ok, try the blood orange sangria I promise it's wonderful!!! The longer we were there the more people filed in although one would never notice as the noise level stayed extremely low. The four of us all had a different entree and we blown away by both the taste as well as lunch portion size. Our table shared bread pudding for dessert although I'm not a fan of bread pudding everyone else at the table said it's the best they've ever had!!! We'll be back and I promise if you give them a try you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"A great experience for a birthday dinner. A friend recommended and said we would not be disappointed... and we were not!  Had the pasta with meat sauce and a chicken dish and both were winners. Great wait staff as well. Will return soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian food!!  I have been going here for years and after a recent visit I realized I never reviewed it!  My favorite app here is the goat cheese and bread.  They drizzle the sauce around the plate so you get a hearty mix of the cheese and sauce mixture for your bread - YUM.  I have liked every pasta dish I have ordered here - and the pizza is made in their wood-fired oven.  

Recently I got the pasta with vodka sauce - it is so much food!  Very delicious but heavy, you can easily split this with your dinner partner.  The outdoor patio is so breezy and cozy you will love to linger over your wine.  The fireplace is a great touch and creates perfect setting for a romantic date."}
{"text":"Good enough.

I have been many, many times and never had the same waiter -- it seems to have high turnover. Thus, you always have a 'new' waiter, and it shows.

I drink a lot of soda or sweet tea, and I often run dry. I resort to sending signals (ignored) like putting my glass on the edge of the table and making puppy-dog faces. Sadly my cute face is wasted here.

The food is good. I always spoil my meal with the bread and pepper-olive oil starter they bring.  As a vegetarian there are few, few options. In fact, I have only ever had 1 dish every time I have visited.

For a place that is trying to be 'nice' it would be better to update the menu periodically, and make some dishes vegetarian or at least allow them to be adapted.

The atmosphere is sorta stuffy, but I suppose typical Charlotte. People are dressier here than you would expect for lunch, but likely due to bankers coming on lunchtime and nearby Ladies Who Lunch from Myers Park."}
{"text":"We went to Mama Ricotta's before a play at Ovens Auditorium. I was a bit worried that we didn't have enough time to eat before the show, but the staff assured us that we would be on our way in plenty of time. And we were- they kept to our schedule while feeding us excellent food! The portions were generous and we all took extra home for another meal. My only problem was that we didn't have enough time to relax and take in the wonderful atmosphere and great wine selection.i will definitely return, hopefully to be able to savor things slowly next time!!"}
{"text":"On Friday night the office I work for had our Christmas Party at Mama Ricotta's. It was a great time, it has a great atmosphere but the food was sub par. I think we ordered every appetizer on the menu.

Calamari - It was ok, I am not much of a fan it did seem a bit on the rubbery side. 

Bruschetta - Was very soggy with the tomatoes, not sure if that was the point but soggy bread is not very appetizing. 

Tomatoes with mozzarella - The tomatoes were great but the mozzarella slices were SO thick it was ridiculous, nearly double the size of the tomatoes. 

Goat Cheese - This was without a doubt my favorite of anything all night. Very rich and smooth. 

I ended up ordering the special of the evening: Chicken and spinach ravioli with white truffle oil. It was good but nothing to rave about. 

I have had way better Italian in Charlotte so its hard for me to recommend Ricotta's.


Oh and I dont know if it was me but the floor seemed super slippery!"}
{"text":"best pizza in charlotte!!!! my favorite date night."}
{"text":"This is a very comfortable place and has great food.  They don't do anything that pushes the culinary envelope but what they do they do very well.  A friend took me here when I was relatively new to Charlotte because of my love of Nutella.  Mama's serves Nutella Pie - which is amazing.  If you want an easy and comfortable atmosphere and some great food then you have to head to Mama's"}
{"text":"Team Appreciation Luncheon!  This was my first visit to Mama Ricotta.  The food was great, portions generous.  The servers were a little frazzled and slightly confused when delivering our orders.  I will put that down to the size of our party.  Our main server was very attentive, refilling drive and such. I had the butternut squash ravioli, which was pretty tasty.  The bread pudding for dessert was to die for.  I will definitely drag hubby here for our next date night."}
{"text":"Veal was great.  Lasagna could use little more ricotta but it was great.  Bread pudding the best.  Going back for pizza.  Danny was an awesome server.  The service was so much better than I'm used to anywhere.  He really does his job well.  It was a wonderful dinner.  Looking forward to pizza and linguine next time."}
{"text":"The taste was great that I ate it so fast and didn't check the color of the meat.  thnext day when I woke up with food poisoning I looked and the chicken was clearly way more pink than it should have been... I called and spoke with the manager and he promised that he would call back and that was days ago and I haven't heard from the restaurant... Disappointed that that is how they run business if somebody gets sick."}
{"text":"**Bar and Drinks only**
Got to our dinner destination early and decided to pop in for a drink. Large really cute covered outside patio dining area. Inside is cozy. Hostess friendly and smiley, coming and going. The smell was amazing in here. The bar was pretty darn small (maybe a six seater). I'm now beginning to think NODA Jam Session is stalking me. I looked up and there she was staring back at me. House Cab was just okay and I thought $8 was a little steep for just okay. Bartender, cheery, polite and not pushy. Made some menu recomendations for when we come back and wished us a nice evening at Meskerem. Hope to get back soon and hopefully everything tastes as good as it smells and looks!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you-this place is amazing. Go inside and enjoy the amazing food and service. We had Danny as a server; I would argue he is the best server I've ever had. Without a doubt, request him! And enjoy!"}
{"text":"Perfect location for group birthday!  Great food, nice staff, gluten free options, polite about separate checks. Burrata w prosciutto was excellent, bread is always yummy, mamas salad was good and out family pasta dishes were delicious!  Best thing there= Nutella pie!  Better than crack or so I hear!  Had to order to special for bday boy am it was devoured!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dinner at Mama Ricotta's this past Friday night.  I went there to celebrate a friend's birthday, and our server Danny assisted in making it a wonderful evening! We had a reservation (which I'd recommend for a Friday), and we waited no time at all despite the crowd. 

The bread was great, our tomato, fresh mozzarella and basil appetizer was wonderful, and our two entrees (we had a mama's salad with grilled chicken and the pasta dinner special) were delicious!  We ended the meal with the apple crisp which was warm and served with a cinnamon gelato.  Everything was delicious.

Our server, as I mentioned before, made the evening great as well!  He was very attentive to our needs and engaged in conversation without being too talkative.

Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my college graduation. I looked at TripAdvisor for a Italian restaurant good for kids and for special celebrations. That lead me to Mama's. However..... obviously people reviewing here and giving 5 stars don't know about Italian culinary. The restaurant menu includes a briefing about the owner's family and history. They can indeed be Italians but they have managed to create a menu based upon what us Americans think about Italian food (pasta sauces and breads with loads of garlic on it and lasagna with ricotta cheese on it). Just take as an example Olive Garden.... and I am not comparing Mama's to Olive Garden as the food here is much better, but in terms of laying down the american vision and taste for Italian food.

If there is an authentic Italian restaurant in Charlotte that is the Luce Ristorante in Uptown and also Dolce Ristorante. 

This restaurant has a decent quality of food, the service is great, but quite honestly, I have tasted better pasta than this one at Hawthorne Pizza Bar in Huntersville.

The Nutella pie that everyone claims to be \"delicious\" does not taste like Nutella at all. It tastes like Peanut Butter cheese cake. I even asked the server if she had made a mistake and brought the wrong dessert and she said that it was the correct one. We then said: It tastes like Peanut Butter and she replied: Really? But doesn't Nutella tastes like Peanut Butter to you??? That response made me think that clearly that the restaurant may not even know what they are cooking."}
{"text":"We went there for Mother's Day today & were shocked with the buffet instead of the regular menu. It was $35 per person but we stayed there just because we were already gathered there. The food wasn't good, none of my family members enjoyed it and even the lasagna was below average. Overall, I will not be going back because fancy food preparation does not compensate for poor taste."}
{"text":"Went to Mama Ricotta's last night with my family (there were 6 of us) for my daughter's birthday.  First turnoff was when we received our bruschetta appetizer - the bread was literally black!  Black - I'm talking completely burned to a crisp! - I cannot imagine what went through the server's mind that this was ok bring to us!???  Trying to cover it up with the bruschetta was not ok.  They did have the decency to remove the $9.50 charge from our bill.      

Second - on the menu they have chicken parmesan listed - Single serving -$18.00 and Family Style - $33.00.   We ordered one of each kind - 1 single and 1 family.  When placing the order for the family size chicken parmesan, the waiter asked if we wanted the pasta with it - we said yes.   That was all he said - \"do you want to the pasta with it?\"  We thought it was an odd question because when have you ever ordered chicken parmesan in any restaurant and not had it come with a side of pasta???   NEVER, absolutely NEVER.   When they brought the food to the table, my son, who ordered the single size chicken parm, received  2 pieces of chicken and pasta on the plate.   The family size order came with 5 pieces of chicken on a plate and a \"soup size\" bowl side of pasta.    When the waiter brought us the check, we had been charged $47.00 for the family size chicken parm, not $33.00 as the menu listed.    When I asked him about it, he said \"that was for the pasta you said you wanted\".  I calmly said \"you did not say it was EXTRA for a small bowl of \"side\" pasta or that it would cost FOURTEEN DOLLARS!\"   His only comment was \"I can get the manager for you - I don't know - I can get the manager for you\"   he just kept repeating that over and over again. It was weird.   All I wanted was clarification, because when I looked at the menu again - there was another column listed by the single and family that said \"+2sides\".  So I asked him again - what is the column that says 2 sides for?  If that is where you got the extra charge from , why did we only get ONE side of pasta?   Again, he flipped out and just repeated \"I can get the manager\"   What was his problem? Does he not understand the menu?  Not wanting to continue this scene the waiter was making, we just paid the bill and left.   I did not want my daughter's birthday dinner ruined by this idiot that can't explain the menu or doesn't understand it.  

I CANNOT believe they charged us FOURTEEN dollars for a small soup bowl of pasta not to mention - why are they charging AT ALL for pasta to go with chicken parm?    There was NO charge for the pasta that came with my son's single serving of chick parm?   WHY does pasta come with that size and not the other????  WHY???    

I will NEVER go back to this restaurant again - it is a total rip off."}
{"text":"Hadn't been in over a year and went on A Saturday night. It was quite busy but we were seated and had a nice waitress. My wine was sour so I sent it back. We ordered the Family Style Penne Vodka sauce pasta with Fresh Ricotta but alas it came without any ricotta. We also ordered the Polenta with Marscapone and Parm but it was Ice cold. They took it back and replaced it with hot Polenta. They also took it off our check . The Penne was good.
Just a lot of little things that went wrong for a 50.00 Dinner !"}
{"text":"Finally was afforded the chance to try this place out.  I've heard many great things and can't say that they were wrong at all.

Started out with garlic knot bread that was delicious and warm and melted like butter.  I followed that up with a seafood dish that had Prince Edward island oysters and shrimp.  So good!  

The setting here is romantic and makes for a great date spot.  Our waiter was great, his table side manner was perfect for a relaxing and unwinding type dinner.  He did a great job selecting a wine that both me and my date really enjoyed."}
{"text":"The Food at Mama Ricotta's is very good!  The Pasta Entrees  are fresh and they have a wide variety of Dishes!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My best friend was visiting from Puerto Rico and wanted pasta so I took him to one of the best places in Charlotte. It's been a while since I've had Mama ricotta's but not much has changed. The food was still great and service was friendly. Oh and the garlic bread oh my WORD hello carbs good bye diet! So very good and the calamari was delicious! Our only complaint would be the over cooked parmesan that was also under seasoned. Other than that everything was great! Thank you Mama ricottas we will be back!"}
{"text":"Consistently great Italian food.  My personal favorites are the chopped salad, the lemon, broccoli, chicken penne (without the chicken), and the nutella pie (bigger than you can imagine and delicious).  The marscapone appetizer is also great, but I find I usually don't have room.  Can be very crowded, so I tend to go off times.  Parking is not usually an issue.  The wait staff have been consistently helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience. David was very friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. Great drinks and great food. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant! There is plenty of parking it's located in a shopping center area with a strip. The have an indoor and outdoor seating arrangement. I made a reservation on a Saturday night and didn't include one of the children in the party they were very accolading. Upon entering we were seated and greeted promptly. We were soon seated afterwards. The server was friendly, patient, knowledgeable, and attentive. Everything I ate was good and I'm not big on Italian. The salad, cheese ravioli, salmon, and chocolate cake were great. At the end they asked how we wanted to split the check. Very thoughtful even though one person was paying. The restrooms were clean and overall I have a great impression of this place. I will definitely return and highly recommend. This is a gem!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here last night with family and friends. Food was awesome and the staff was excellent.  Pizza and Lasagna were both cooked perfectly.   Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"OMG! Mama Ricotta's! How do I love thee, let me count the penne vodka pasta with salmon! Yesterday to cap off our eclipse viewing fun, a group of new friends and I visited this amazing restaurant on my recommendation. I have been going here off and on for about 10 years and they NEVER disappoint! Everyone enjoyed their dishes (e.g., salmon dinner, pizza, lasagna, etc.) and I bought a couple of bread puddings for sharing at the table. Splendid"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and it was AMAZING. Our waiter was great and timely. The food was fresh, authentic and delicious"}
{"text":"Following a busy Sunday, I was having a serious craving for pasta. Living gluten free, I don't often get the chance to enjoy pasta in restaurants. There's no notation on the menu or on the website, but after catching a Yelp review mentioning a gluten free offering, we took the chance and headed to Mama Ricotta's.

On a Sunday evening, dining on a whim, we were pleased to be seated immediately even though we didn't have a reservation. We were placed in the back corner of the restaurant, which offered a decent vantage point for people watching and peeking at dishes coming out of the kitchen.

Our server came and shared with me that most of the pasta dishes can be made gluten free by substituting a GF penne. I hemmed and hawed and ended up choosing the Carbonara. My date ordered a salad to start, and it arrived within minutes of placing our order. The pacing was strange, though -- he got his salad, bread for the table was delivered, and our entrees came within five minutes of one another. Generally, I'm pumped about speedy service, but it created an awkward timeline of our meal -- potentially because we were dining 20 minutes before closing time.

My meal was placed in front of me in a large, black ceramic bowl. Three greasy fingerprints reflected the light on the rim of my bowl, and a long streak followed around the edge from where someone in the kitchen had attempted to wipe my plate before service. On a white plate, this may not have been so glaring, but it definitely caught my attention. The kitchen needs more clean linens, apparently.

My pasta was delightful. The flavor was perfect and it was delivered at just the right temperature. I was pleased with the portion size and with the generosity of the gentleman grating fresh parmesan over my noodles. I also sampled my date's short rib, and it was quite good.

If I wasn't so happy with the flavor, price and portion size of my gluten free pasta, the frantic service and streaky plate would have turned me off entirely. I'll give Mama Ricotta's another try when it's not so close to closing time, and hopefully they'll earn more stars from me."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food. The first time we went (pictures shown) we ordered shrimp scampi and chicken parm. SO GOOD! I rarely finish my meals but that does not happen here. You get bread with oil in the beginning the seasoning for the oil could be better. The second time we came (sorry, no pictures) it was half off wine bottles so we decided to do that. I got penne alla vodka with added chicken and my boyfriend got Chianti raised short rib. Mine was SO good and again I ate it all and my boyfriend was obsessed with his meal saying how soft and tender the meal was."}
{"text":"Great food! The penne vodka was great!  Get the Nutella cheesecake! Service was great and prices were reasonable too.  Will return"}
{"text":"We visited today for lunch and ordered the carbonara and it tasted rancid and old!!!! It was AWFUL, we sent back and bolted!"}
{"text":"Ok I've been eating Italian, real Italian, all my life with my friends and family through New York and New England and even in Italy and I am blown away by the authenticity and quality of the food at Mama Ricotta's - I've lived in Charlotte for about 2 years now and have missed this place until today, New Years Eve 2014. It's not really in my hood but decided I wanted some Rigatoni, Yelp'd it, and these guys came up. I've driven by it dozens of times and to be honest, thought it may be a sandwich/sub shop or some other take out type strip mall joint. DON\"T BE FOOLED by the unassuming street front. Go inside and check it out!! I literally stopped at the reception (yes, I was greeted and welcomed) and had to smile. While taking in the inviting, Italian Chalet ambience that looks like it should be situated on some Mediterranean bluff, I was directed over to the bar to pick up my take away order. The kind gent behind the bar, who was on the horn taking other orders, glanced over with a quick smile to let me know he knew I was there. This is something I always notice in a restaurant or anywhere customer service is important - does that staff look past you or do they make an effort for eye contact? Based on the time frame from order to when I actually arrived (10 min) he was able to guess who I was and promptly went to packaging my order. Needless to say I was already excited - it smelled like my Auntie Rita's (not really my aunt) kitchen on Sunday afternoon. An oversized handled bag (re-usable) was filled with what appeared to be my order plus maybe another 2 patrons orders. Everything was kept in a warmer cabinet (not under a heat lamp) until I arrived which was also housing baking sheets full of tear apart rolls...they'll change your life, for sure. I had a moment to look around their bar/lounge area which I will certainly be back to. I didn't see the wine list but it appears you'll most definitely be able to find something you like - I saw lots of good opened bottles meaning you can get it by the glass. There is a wood fired pizza oven as soon as you walk in and I saw a few being carried out by the staff that looked really nice. The bar keep thanked me, wished me Happy New Year and off I went.
I ordered the Rigatoni with Meat Sauce and the Chopped Salad. Absolutely amazing!
The pasta was cooked perfectly - great texture and flavor. The gravy was bright red and full of fresh tomato flavor. The meat was tender and possibly rough chopped meatballs. The wife thought there should be more gravy but I thought it was just perfect. The salad was certainly a masterpiece. Chopped is certainly the right name for this salad. Everything in it was chopped so that it blended all of the flavors of the salad in every bight.  Olives, Pepperoncini, Tomatoes, Blue Cheese, Nuts (Walnuts??), Lettuce, Kale, Carrot, Onion, Chick Pea.....all I can say is, Damn!
Needless to say, I'll be back, lots - Can't wait to work my way through their menu. 
Thanks, Mama!"}
{"text":"Shortly after moving to Charlotte, I fell in love with Mama Ricotta's.  I blame it on the goat cheese and mascarpone dip, which was my first bite of food on my very first visit to Mama's.

Mama's is the type of place where families feel equally comfortable as couples on hot dates.  The dining room is cozy with large family-sized booths plus intimate tables for two, vintage family photos, and a large wood-fired pizza oven.

My recommendations:  goat cheese and mascarpone dip, mama's salad, chopped salad, housemade burrata, any of the pastas, pollo bianco, bread pudding.. and so much more.. 

I posted a full review on the blog, but these are the highlights."}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS meal.  The best Italian food Ive had since moving from NYC.  Authentic meals, fresh ingredients and excellent little details.  Must try the chianti short ribs ~ yum"}
{"text":"We went out with friends to try this restaurant. We order apps of Mozzarella and Tomatoes, Bruschetta with Mozzarella (you have to ask for the Mozzarella). We did ask for additional Balsamic Vinegar. The addition made them from delicious to outstanding! The house made Mozzarella was so creamy and smooth. As a group of 4 we decided to do the family portion Chicken Parmesan with angel hair pasta. There was very little tomato basil sauce, but we asked for additional and they gladly brought it. The flavor of the Chicken Parmesan was on point. The side of angel hair pasta was enormous and way more than 4 adults needed. 
If anyone left hungry it was their own fault. Portions generous and very tasty. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure we had drinks full and cleared dishes to keep things tidy. 
We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I think I will just get right to why it was given a one star because other than the one really big bad part it was an okay evening (nothing to write home about) that I would have probably given a 3 star.  

Our food arrives, I ordered the cheese ravioli but added shrimp to it for an additional $6.  When it comes I begin to eat my first shrimp and see it doesn't look cooked.  I really inspected it, like always the lighting is low for \"the mood\" so it was hard to see.  I look through my other shrimps and they all still look very gray.  I ask others at the table and they agree.  When the waitress comes by to check on us I genuinely asked for her opinion as well and she too says it doesn't look cooked - it's raw shrimp! She takes it to be re-cooked and it comes back all well and good but now I'm not really feeling the shrimp so I avoid it.  The manager comes by and asks \"is the shrimp to your liking now?\" To my liking? I don't feel like this is like beef where I confused rare, medium, and well.  Shrimp is either cooked or it's not.  

My bill comes, and though I didn't ask for it I somewhat expected them to comp the $6 shrimp charge.  Nope.  It was still one there.  I looked up the possibilities of what could happen from eating raw shrimp and it stated that it would most likely cause food poisoning if anything.  Call me crazy though, but I would hope places I go to eat would help me avoid getting food poisoning from their food.  I felt like I got no apologies, no customer service for a fairly big screw up, and I could have gotten really sick from their mistake on a holiday weekend no less!

I don't think I'll choose to go back here again from this experience.  I might if a member of my party requests it (because other than that it wasn't terrible), but I will NOT order a meat dish from them again."}
{"text":"Delicious!! I heard so many good things about this restaurant and finally tried it! Now it is one of my favorites in Charlotte. Their pork ribs are outstanding and I now crave the goat cheese and mascarpone appetizer. The portions were huge. My boyfriend and I splitt the pork ribs and we were both stuffed. Everything I've tried at Mama Ricotta's has been fabulous!"}
{"text":"I loved this Italian restaurant and thought it was extremely affordable! That being said we got 2 glasses of wine, 2 beers, a small Tuscan salad, penne alla vodka with chicken, polka alla griglia, and the chocolate cake-- and spent about 60ish dollars. We loved every single bite. Service was extremely nice and we got our food quickly. They also had delicious garlic rolls they give you in the beginning. Loved the experience."}
{"text":"It has been about a year since I've been back  only because I live in south Charlotte  and this restaurant is not close to me 
The food is wonderful fresh and I've been  The food is wonderful fresh and  delicious. Came here today for lunch and there was hardly anyone there. Nick was our waiter with excellent service and selection. I was pleasantly pleased with the chicken pasta dish and  short rib cheesesteak sandwich - awesome.
Will not wait another year to return.

FYI - - - lunch is a excellent time to come here"}
{"text":"This terrific casual Italian place in Charlotte's Midtown neighborhood is a great spot for lunch, dinner, or a couple of drinks after work. The food is wonderful, particularly their Penne Alla Vodka and their humongous calzones. Service is always friendly and prompt, and the covered patio overlooking the Greenway is a great spot in warm weather. There are better Italian restaurants in Charlotte, but for the price, Mama Ricotta's is consistently on target."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed this restaurant several times before. Last night was definitely a change. We had the calamari as an appetizer and was disappointed. It used to be spicy with peppers but was pretty plain last night. I also had the Lasagna for my entree which was not what I expected. Another party in our group ordered a large salad as their meal and was brought a small salad. The waitress didn't know how to handle this mix up. Very disappointed with this visit."}
{"text":"I absolutely hate to write negative reviews, but in this case, it's unfortunately unavoidable.

I honestly have no idea how this restaurant has the rating that it does, because it is an extremely poor example of what Italian food is.  The best way for me to sum up the food here is: One step below Olive Garden and Ragazzis.  The food is watered-down and bland, Americanized 'fake Italian' dishes that cater to those patrons with unsophisticated palates who don't know the difference. 

I ordered the Pasta Carbonara when we are here, and I have no idea how they classify what was placed in front of me as 'Carbonara'.... It was basically a fake from-the-jar Alfredo sauce on top of undercooked vermicelli with some frozen peas and bacon thrown in.  In order to be Carbonara, the dish must have a sauce comprised mostly of whisked eggs, pasta water, Parmesan, and seasoning.  Calling what was served \"Carbonara\" is just wrong, and is an unfair representation of Italian food.

The wine was actually fairly good (I think we ordered a Pinot and a Riesling), and our waitress was very kind.  She was so nice that I felt bad about hardly touching my food, and didn't want to tell her how bad we all thought our meals were. It really wasn't her fault that the food was awful!

There are several other Italian cuisine restaurants in the area that are actually real Italian, and are far better than Mama Ricottas (for ex: Vivace, Fiamma).  If you enjoy real Italian food and/or are a foodie, save yourself the time and money and search out another option.

Sadly, the only reason that I even gave this place 2 stars is because the service and the staff were pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"I was back here a little while ago as a friend loves the place and though I can think of several other Italian places I like better, I do like the folks and the food here.

Portions are good sized and service is good as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this restaurant based on a Yelp recommendation. It was awesome. The penne Ala vodka was delicious. The tiramisu was unbelievable. Nice size portions and delicious flavors. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Great chopped salad, full of flavor.  Incredible house made ravioli, perfect texture to the pasta and perfect cheese.  Top that off with a delicious dessert and stellar service to boot, and it all adds up to a flawless experience.  Wish this was located where we live.  We would come here every week at least."}
{"text":"Purchase several dishes for a family gathering, and the family size shocked us all as it was small...2 portions worth/dish.  The taste was good, but -for the price- expected much larger portions.  For family orders, there are better deals elsewhere."}
{"text":"My experience here was good. Host or owner was very nice at the front, helped me with anything needed. I ordered the ravioli in a vodka sauce. The sauce was thick buying felt like they used a meat sauce and could have been creamier. They bring bread but it just looks like seasoned frozen bad, not bad, just not something for a good Italian restaurant.  I would probably try somewhere else next time or order something different. It is not a bad restaurant at all just I have had better"}
{"text":"Best most authentic Italian around, and I'm a picky NYer.  Great food, but book ahead or the waits can be long."}
{"text":"Great place, I love the atmosphere, and the food is delicious. One of my favorite pasta restaurants in all of Charlotte. There's a server named Ben that has provided us with excellent service, he recommended a great Malbec for me since I told him I like dry reds. Ben, as well as Mama Ricotta's, have always exceeded expectations!"}
{"text":"I can't say much about Mama Ricotta's location, because it's in a little strip mall type area, and I hate those. Moving right along....

Mama Ricotta's is great, some of the better Italian food in Charlotte, as far as I'm concerned. It's a really popular place (if you can't get a table, try the Ethiopian place in the same complex--great food, never packed, yummmmy), so try to make reservations or show up either earlier or later in the night. Once you're at your table, though, everything's all right. 

Great beers and wines available, so you're always able to get well-lubricated over the course of a loud, heaping Italian meal. And the meals are ALWAYS huge. Their pastas are great--that's what most people order, as far as I can tell--as are their typical Italian restaurant salads and appetizers. You can get everything served Family Style if you like, which makes for portions that you won't believe. Great value, especially if you don't mind taking home large amounts of food to nibble on for the rest of the weekend. I love their Chicken (forget what it's called, but it's grilled with lemon), and I got like three breasts of it last time I was there, which is  nuts. 

If you love Italian, and love eating lots and lots, check it out."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. My hubby and I visit Mama Ricotta's fairly frequently. We chose to have our NYE dinner here with friends... and couldn't have chosen a tastier place to wrap up 2017. 

We were seated in a booth on the far side of the restaurant against the windows, and were slightly concerned that we'd be a little cold given the wintry temp outside. The heat was on full-blast, though, and we were SO happy about it - seriously, when are you ever actually warm in a restaurant?!

I highly recommend splitting the Chopped Salad -- the small ($7) is great to share with two people if you're looking for a little green before carb-ing out. Hubby got his usual lasagna and considering his plate was clean in 5 minutes, I'm betting it was awesome (didn't get to sneak a bite). I chose the Pollo Carciofi and it was seriously incredible -- my new favorite go-to meal for sure. Even better, I only ate half and have a super yummy lunch to look forward to this week. 

Thanks for yet another great experience, MR!"}
{"text":"I would rate this as the most authentic Italian food in charlotte. During the winter there is a great fire going on the patio making the patio still nice to eat. The portions are large which is great if your going for a family style dining, Prices are a little high but for the amount of food your getting its completely worth it. This is the type of Italian food you expect the traditional large Italian woman (and I mean large large not just slightly overweight but very rotund) to be making food in the kitchen. I have been to Italy two times and gives this place a thumbs up for best Italian food in charlotte - please do yourself a favor and go there maybe even bring your own marshmallows to roast :) ."}
{"text":"We loved it here! The family style entrees was great in portions. The ravioli and carbonara was excellent. We got calamari spicy and it probably was the best calamari I've had!"}
{"text":"My party had a reservation and we were seated immediately. I ordered a medium white pizza with chicken & #noregrets. It was so good! Bread and olive oil/ red pepper is brought out while you wait for your food. My cousin ordered the penne ala vodka and she really enjoyed it. Our server was super friendly and polite. I love the atmosphere or this restaurant and I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"A great place to take the family for an Italian night. They have portions big enough to share with the family or you can get an individual dish. I suggest not getting an appetizer if you're looking to finish your meal. It's still a big dish for one person. They bring out Fresh bread and oil before dinner, so that can be your appetizer. For dinner, I ordered the Penne Alla Vodka with chicken to give it some extra protein. For a red sauce it was actually very light. I also got their sangria which was delicious and highly suggest if you are looking for something light and fruity. The service was great and it didn't take long for our food to come out for 4 people. This is also a great place for a date or if you are looking for catering, they do that too!"}
{"text":"I have not had the pleasure of eating at Mama Ricotta's in a long long time until the night before a half marathon came and we were looking through options of where to \"carb load\" before the race.

We made reservations as our group of 7 was fairly large, they accommodated us and even called about 3 times to make sure we were still coming.  With a small dining space I guess they need to ensure their bookings so that they don't end up holding a table when they can really seat customers waiting for a table.

Fresh rolls with olive oil and red pepper flakes were a nice surprise... usually it's just the generic bread with oil and balsamic.  I found it to be a nice twist to an old favorite.

The restaurant itself has an old neighborhood-familiarity to it and everyone working makes you feel welcome and happy that you are there sharing a meal with them.

Its Italian, I don't know about authentic, but the portions are ginormous and the favors are comforting.

I'd say the only crazy thing about the place is the wait since it's so popular, but there are ways around it, reservations... eating an \"early\" dinner.  I'd say the earlier the better since it will give you more time to burn off all the yummy calories consumed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Try the Ravioli or the Angel Hair Pasta w/ Meatballs."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I've been to Mama Ricotta's but I promise not to stay away so long anymore.  

Mama Ricotta's has been in Charlotte for years and definitely is one of Charlotte's better family friendly Italian places. They have a decent sized dining room, a bar around the pizza oven, a regular bar and a nice sized patio that is enclosed in cooler months.  

I was here with my dinner group and there were 10 of us and at first our waiter seemed a bit off guard but he quickly got into gear. He explained draft beers are $3 on Tuesdays! Yay! There were 4 selections of which 2 were local of OMB and NoDa.

I went with the ciopino which I thank the Food Network for getting me interested in trying the dish and also ordered a small chopped salad. Even though the restaurant seemed busy, the food came out fast. I was only half done with my salad with the meal arrived. The salad was delicious and probably one of my favorite Italian salads. The ciopino was almost too beautiful to eat but I managed very well.  And then the tiramisu for dessert was light and slightly sweet which is just what I was looking for to finish the meal.

I enjoyed my time here very much. I plan to come back to try their other specialties and pizzas."}
{"text":"I ordered Salmoni Arrostiti Olivada. Oven roasted premium filet of salmon. Absolutely amazing. Highly recommended. We also ordered a few appetizers that was also excellent. No disappointments at all."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Mama R's. They serve consistently great food and as usual, their sauce/gravy was outstanding.

Give them a try if you're looking for some great Italian food."}
{"text":"When you think of a nice Italian restaurant, you don't think it would come in a strip mall, but Mama Ricotta's bucks the trend. Not only does the atmosphere & decor give the impression of a nicer Italian place, the food is pretty good.

While you may be thinking that this is a dinner only place, this is actually a really popular lunch place. There is usually a line during lunch, but it moves pretty quickly, especially if the outside seating is open. While the food can be a tad on the pricey side, I have yet to have a meal I haven't been happy with. They have plenty of selections for all Italian lovers so don't expect just the obvious options. 

I'd suggest this place as more of a dinner place, mainly because of the prices along with the portion sizes. If you lunch it here, it may be a long afternoon at work trying to stay awake. And with their wine selection, making this a date destination isn't a bad idea either."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of Mama Ricotta's. The bread was so delicious, but when we were out, we were never offered a refill..bummer. 
I ordered the grilled chicken entree and it was really good. The side items were only decent, spinach and broccolini. 
The BEST part of the meal, the dessert! The cheesecake was AMAZING! I only had a few bites and it was enough to satisfy my sweet tooth."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here and we loved it! We came in on Friday night during the dinner rush, but we never felt hurried. My wife had the rigatoni with meat sauce while I opted for the ravioli with meat sauce. Our server, Ben, suggested we start out with the tomato and mozzarella appetizer and he even pointed me towards the Malbec, which was perfect with my dinner. A really great night, we look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Mama's is solid Italian food.  Great wine selections by the glass & bottle. 

I love their Tuscan Salad & add shrimp.  The small is plenty for a meal.

They have a great patio with a fireplace table that is cozy.  The patio can be enclosed & heated so they use it all year round.

The servers are always friendly and helpful as are the staff at the host station and mgmt."}
{"text":"For the first time ever I ate at mama ricotta's tonight with my family, I went because my cousin told me it was good.  We ate family style and it was pretty good, I wasn't a fan of the caesar salad because the dressing taste like a tangy mayo.  Other than that it was pretty tasty food.  The service was excellent, our waitress was really nice and very promp.  We were in and out really fast, the longest wait we had was to be seated and that was about 10 minutes or so."}
{"text":"Mama Ricotta's is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Here's why. I like the atmosphere and I love the food. I like Italian and MR has some if the best Italian food in the city. The staff is good as well. My favorite dish is the chicken meatloaf served at lunch? It's a must try? Promise you'll like it."}
{"text":"Once again I had an amazing experience at Mama Ricottas. I made a reservation on open table via the restaurants website and it was so easy and convenient.

We started off with the Goat cheese and marscapone dip because - of course! It's so amazing, I always order it. My main entree was the Pollo Bianco, a delicious chicken breast dish served with melted mozzarella, prosciutto, and a mushroom cream sauce. It was served with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and steamed squash and zucchini. This meal was melt in your mouth delicious. My friends loved their dishes as well, one of which was the same Pollo Bianco and the other was the Pollo Carifoci. Not sure if I spelled that right but she loved it. This dish was chicken with artichokes, capers and a lemon butter sauce - their version of chicken piccata. 

Dessert was great, however I did get it to go because I was stuffed! Chocolate cannoli cake. Absolutely amazing. 

Our server Abbi was attentive and extremely welcoming and did an amazing job. 

We will be back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"We are repeat visitors here as we love the Main dishes. The salads are amazing, too. Previously, we have had a few blips on the radar with soggy veggies and spotty service. Our visit a week ago was stellar. Everything was completely on point. Our request for a booth smoothly managed. Our salad order taken and filled immediately. And the entrees with accompanying sides were delicious and perfectly seasoned. A great night out!"}
{"text":"This is not real italian food to me. The sauce isn't right. The chicken parm is so thick it's like an entire chicken breast, and the seasoning on the breadcrumbs is so salty it took away from the rest of the dish. Chicken parm should be super thin and crispy, and this was just a disappointment. The sauce tasted plain and sweet, like it wasn't seasoned. I was surprised that our meal was so lackluster considering the number of 5 star reviews this restaurant has. We probably won't come back to Mama Ricotta's. I'll stay home and make pasta from scratch."}
{"text":"As good as it gets, in my opinion! I absolutely love this place! I take my family whenever they come into town. Great atmosphere, wonderful staff, and great food."}
{"text":"Everything was EXTREMELY salty. I could kinda see how the flavors might have been good, except it was buried under a ton of salt. I would write more but I've got to put my feet up so they don't swell."}
{"text":"Consistently good, very reasonable prices. The service is not always great. I guess it depends on what server you get. But the food makes up for any bad service. Highly recommend the pizzas, chicken parmesan and lasagna. They make a terrific meat sauce!"}
{"text":"Our server Leslie was a perfect waitress and very knowledgeable about the menu items. 

The appetizer was decent, the entrees were also good, not the best I have ever had, but really good overall. 

Where this restaurant shines the most is the dessert, every dessert I've had/seen was well priced for the huge portions you get. The cannoli was very good, probably the largest cannoli I have seen, the shell was very fresh and the cream inside was good. I think it could have been more sweet and less ricotta but still I very much liked it. 

I definitely will be back, if you go no question get a dessert."}
{"text":"I've eaten there twice now, and really enjoyed it both times. This IS exceptional because I'm not a big fan of Italian cuisine! We ordered our food \"family style\" both times. Lots of food and lots of fun that way. 

We had the Chicken Parm, the Chicken Carciofi, and the Cheese Ravioli. All were outstanding, especially having been preceded with the Tuscan Salad and \"Mama's Salad\". Fanatastico!

Great food and great service. I'll go back again if I'm in downtown Charlotte in the future."}
{"text":"Plastic in my food ,and the MOD wasn't that accommodating.. I use to be a fan !! Things happen,but Terribly disappointed in how management handled the situation."}
{"text":"Ive had good and bad experiences here- Ive been three times: Overall I would go back ive decided 

Decent prices and decent (not wonderful) Italian food. 

The first time I ordered the vodka riggies- which came recommended...While they were ok I make much better at home so I wasn't impressed. My family didnt care for their lunches either 

2nd time- I was sick so I ordered soup and salad- I dont think its fair to judge on this- my boyfriend raved about his meal (he has a special pasta with lobster sauce) 

3rd - I finally found something I really enjoyed here ! I had the Pollo Carciofi ...delicious! I did substitute the polenta but the chicken was fabulous ...I will definitely come back!

I also had the red sangria which I enjoyed more than Maggianos 

Service has always been great- try to call ahead if you can"}
{"text":"This is a great Italian restaurant! I've been here a couple times now and have always had wonderful food.

Note the portion sizes are pretty large so come hungry or with a friend or group! (They do come in individual portions or family size). It's great if you're looking to try a bunch of different things.

The two times I've gone, I've seen birthday parties, girls night out, date night and big family gatherings. 

As with almost all Italian restaurants, they serve dinner rolls. These are delicious plain but even better dipped in their oil. If you're sensitive to spice, be wary as the oil has some heat to it.

Their salads are also generous in portions. I went with my boyfriend and we split a small Tuscan salad prior to our entree. We ordered the family size ravioli with meat sauce which is enough to feed 2-3 people. The cheese filling is delicious!! 

I can't wait to go back and try some of their other dishes like lasagna and pollo Romano.

Ps: if you're an Open Table user, they are on there!"}
{"text":"When the craving for pasta hits - you just can't let it go unanswered- you turn to your trusty Yelp app to figure out where to go. After seeing the pictures of giant plates of chicken parmesan smothered in cheese we decided on Mama Ricottas. 

I was shocked at how busy they were on a Sunday night! We were seated immediately but after sitting down we saw people waiting. The atmosphere was great. A dimly lit Italian restaurant just as we were hoping for. Service could have been better, but I think our server was just over it by Sunday night. He probably worked a double or two over the weekend-- I get it. 

We ordered a bottle of wine and started in on the bread and olive oil. The calamari sold me because of the cherry peppers. However, I didn't realize we needed to order it Rhode Island style for it to come out this way. In my excitement I didn't read close enough. Was disappointed when it didn't come out with the peppers, but now I know for next time. My server offered to have it tossed, but since it was our mistake, I declined. 

The chicken parm was just as big and beautiful as it was in the picture. Took over half of it home. I would prefer a little more sauce (the marinara was great), so next time I would just ask for it. Boyfriend got the lasagna, which he loved. For $12 it was a great deal. 

Overall, I felt like the food quality and atmosphere was a great value for the price. Great place for a date night-- we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The anipasto app is the best thing you can get outside of Brooklyn. There is no Italian south of jersey that can even compare. Trust me. I have searched north Carolina for 7 years to find something even tolerable and this is above and beyond."}
{"text":"Mama Ricotta's has a big downside - notably it's in a strip mall right on King's Drive.  That makes it easy to access, but it also means that you are likely to dismiss the place as having no atmosphere.  You would do yourself a disservice by doing so (it is worth noting that Villa Antonio has a similar problem on South Boulevard).

Assuming you step inside - rather than dining on the patio - then you make a transition into a great little Italian haven, and you won't regret your decision.  I'm not sure about the patio.  Perhaps once the construction in the area is done and you can see the Little Sugar Creek greenway (assuming that is possible), then it will be okay.  For now, the view is pretty bad.  For now, sit inside.

The service of the staff is great.  We have never found ourselves wanting of anything.  The second the glass is missing an inch or so, they are right there to ask if we would like more (or just refill it).  The bread is plentiful.  The food is delivered promptly.  Even the wait to sit down has never been a problem - but we usually arrive early.  I would suggest reservations if you like to eat later.

When it comes to the food, prepare to eat heartily, because you'll get plenty of it, and it will be full of lots of stuff you probably shouldn't eat.  So if you're on a diet, you might want to think twice.  Otherwise, dig in."}
{"text":"Executive Chef Tom is inventive, creative and a proponent of using locally grown ingredients as evidenced by the exquisite mushroom ravioli I just scarfed that was adorned with a myriad of different types of mushrooms all of which were hand-foraged from a local source.  Enjoy your faves from the menu but also do yourself a favor from time to time and listen to the specials.  Chef Tom is on it.  (Also, Server Sheena is my new favorite!  She's a genuine sweetheart.)"}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner date with the hubs. We has reservations and came in on time. We waited just a few minutes. We got sat in the patio area that's fully covered. Although I don't mind the patio area, it was insanely hot. Almost miserable hot. I was sweating and this was at night during the winter time! I looked around and saw people wearing t-shirts and tank tops. I mentioned something to the server and he said he would ask them to change it and said that if we wanted to eat inside then we would have to wait again for a table. Ugh, annoying. 

It was my husband's first time here and I always raved about this place to him. Last time I was here I overheard our server mention the specials to the tables next to me. I don't know if they are doing specials again but we weren't offered any. Kind of a disappointment. We started off with the calamari. They were breaded good and the sauce was delicious. My husband also got the salad. I got the penne alla vodka with chicken and gluten free noodles. My husband got the same thing but with whole wheat noodles. We noticed our food took a little longer than normal. All the tables that got sat after us, after we got our appetizers all got their foods before us. We finally got the food and I was pretty pleased with the gluten free noodles. The texture was good and it was hard to tell that they were gluten free which is a good thing. My husband also liked his whole wheat noodles. During the whole time, our server was pretty distant. I think he was pretty turned off that we complained about the heat. He filled up our waters once and then towards the end he asked about dessert and that was pretty much it. 

I'm hoping next time is a better experience. Not just for me but for my husband. I seriously love their penne alla vodka though."}
{"text":"One of the last great Italian restaurants in Charlotte. Delicious every single time. A larger bar area would bring new energy to the place, and maybe some nights with live music , but otherwise, if it ain't broke, don't fix it."}
{"text":"I have been here twice recently. Once for lunch and once for dinner. I love the patio here and enjoy the overall feel of it. The calamari is decent but the goat cheese app is something I frequently dream of!! It is amazing. It has marinara and toasted bread points for dipping. I have had the spaghetti with meat sauce and the ravioli with meat sauce. The angel hair is made in house daily and just to die for. The ravioli is cheese filled and the meat sauce is a lovely combo of meat and chunky tomatoes. 

The food is awesome and the service is good as well. I noticed they have a pizza oven as a center piece so I would love to try their pizza next time. But overall a great find for a really decent price. They also have family style dishes which is one of my favorite things ever so I plan on trying that very soon as well. A def must try at least once!"}
{"text":"We arrived early for our reservation and were immediately seated. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and suggested their specials. The food was very good. I added a dollop of homemade ricotta to my dish and it was sublime! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everything about our experience this evening at Mama Ricotta's was good but not outstanding. 
We came in fairly early and were seated immediately, which was nice. They provide free bread and oil, but the bread didn't seem very fresh at all so we didn't touch that other than a few bites. For an appetizer, we started with the goat cheese and mascarpone dip. The tomato sauce was great, and the tangy cheese provided a good balance of flavors. For our entrees, my girlfriend ordered the pollo bianco and I got the lasagna. The pollo bianco was really good - the mushroom gravy went well with the mashed potatoes and chicken, and the broccoli and cauliflower were amazing except for 2 broccoli florets that were severely burnt! The lasagna I had was good, but it was a bit too cheesy for me. Don't get me wrong, I love cheese..but it really just tasted like layers of lasagna noodles with a bit of ricotta between them and a ton of mozzarella melted on top with a bit of tomato and meat sauce on the side. I would have loved for a bit more flavor throughout. 
Our waiter was a bit awkward as well. He did a good job keeping glasses full, taking orders, etc. but just seemed like he wasn't sure how to interact with us. 
All in all, the food and service were solid, and I'd be willing to come back..but I also wasn't blown away by any aspect."}
{"text":"The pollo Bianco was delicious, our waitress was very helpful and told us we could substitute the sauces out-
Family oriented restaurant with options for family portions-
Service was great with a pleasant server, food got out pretty quickly. Server was new but knew about the options available and was overall attentive- 
Prices were reasonable"}
{"text":"It a nice intimate setting. I love the music and ambiance- even for lunch. We had the preferred penne pasta with vodka sauce. The noodles had a lil after-taste, but the salmon was fresh. The sauce is delicious. We also tried the bruschetta- needs more bread for heavy dippers: like myself. Calamari was good.... the shrimp scampi had wayyyyyy to much basil and parsley!  The natural flavor of the pasta was taken away! I'll come back, but next time- I just want some simple salmon and maybe veggies."}
{"text":"Great place if you're looking for authentic, delicious Italian with good service. Our server (whose name I don't remember sorry!!) was amazing and knowledgeable. He chose a wine that was fabulous. And the special was a butternut squash ravioli that was to DIE for."}
{"text":"Mama Ricotta's is like a nice warm blankie in the winter: comforting, familiar and shareable. I've stopped by Mama Ricotta's many a time and, frankly, it's always been at least a good if not great meal. The service has always been friendly (especially in the bar for some reason) and even when things haven't gone perfectly, they have always offered to make it right. Big points here. 

Since I've been here so many times, here is a rundown of a few of my personal favorites:

Goat cheese & marscapone dip: Exactly the nom-ness you would expect. Warm creamy dip topped with tasty tomato sauce and served with grilled crostini.

Pasta Primavera: Pretty basic, but a light and colorful veggie angel hair dish. I've only ordered this with the EVOO sauce but I'm always adding extra spice to give it a kick.  

Butternut squash ravioli: There is a fancier name to this in house, but you'll see what I mean. Delicious, tender butternut squash raviolis with an orange creame sauce, bits of proscuitto, walnuts and sage. It's ass  on a plate and it's amazing.

It's been a while since I've had dessert here, so I really can't comment on that. However, I have been here for brunch and it was asi asi...but really, Mama, you'll know I'll be coming back. Solid resto, solid food and solid service."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place and specifically will arrange time in trips to Charlotte to nip in for lunch or dinner.

Why *only* four stars then?  Well, the last trip wasn't so great overall.

My order was fabulous - we started with the Goat Cheese and Mascarpone dip which is a necessity if you go.  Seriously.  For my dinner I went with the Pollo Bianco, which was phenomenal.  Chicken with prosciutto and mozzarella with a chianti mushroom sauce and a side of mash.  Super delish.

My wife's order was a little less fortunate.  She ordered pasta with marinara and added meatballs.  The pasta and sauce were good, meatballs just okay at best.  Super disappointing after comparing both the app and my meal.

Service was great as always, and I wouldn't hesitate to go back!  Maybe will just order something besides the meatballs next time."}
{"text":"Loved it! We were seated outside and I loved the cute little fireplace and string lights. Nice place for a date. Hubby and I ordered the family size carbonara pasta and it was delicious. The noodles were nice and thick. The sauce was creamy and so tasty. The bacon chunks gave the pasta the perfect salty crunch and flavor. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"You know my rule- if Frank Scibelli's name is on it, it's going to be delicious. 

The Warm Goat Cheese & Mascarpone appetizer is a must for a group. I also love the house made mozzarella and tomatoes. Their Chopped Salad is one of my favorites. I like to get that with a soup. Big fan of the meatballs. They are made with turkey, ricotta, and prosciutto. Delicious. My buddy Fritz always gets their lasagna. 

I like this place because it's pretty versatile. You can take your family, a date, do a girls' night, grab drinks, etc. They have a nice little bar area and their new patio is fantastic. 

Service is always is great. Super friendly staff. Thank you Mama's for being such a consistent go to spot."}
{"text":"Most of the Italians I have known have mothers and grandmothers that are very likely to tell you, \"You're so skinny! You need to eat!  Sit down and let me cook you something.\"  That kind of woman, who can cook me something anytime she wants, must be behind Mama Ricotta's.

It's very warm and inviting inside, with bright reds and oranges and fun paintings, while still being dim and intimate.  The great wood stove and friendly staff that greets you certainly sets the stage for the evening.  We started with the goat cheese appetizer which was creamy and decadent, though didn't scream \"goat cheese\" to me.  It was very good, nonetheless.  For my main entree, I got one of the great meat sauce pasta dishes which is everything you expect great Italian food to be.  I was also impressed with the wine list (which comes to you as more of a book than a list) and the many small-production Italian wines that it contains.

Though a little tough to find, given it's strip mall locale, Mama Ricotta's is a must-try!"}
{"text":"Service was good and the food was great. Came out surprisingly fast too. I would give the restaurant 5 stars but my only gripe was that there menu was a little short. Other than that, it was a great place. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Mama Ricotta's for at least 20 years and the food has always been consistently good,.  The owner is a --- ---- but he does have great food."}
{"text":"While eating a late Saturday night dinner with my husband the entire staff cleaned around us.  From the b floors to breaking down tables.  We will never again dine at this place.  Food was nothing to write home about, average pasta."}
{"text":"We visited this place on Saturday and was so disappointed.  Our wait was one hour and a half without prior reservations.  We sat outside in the heat with a toddler.  When we were notified that table was ready, we were seated back outside in an open area, still hot and nats flying everywhere.  The manager explain there was a wedding party and no seats available inside.  We asked to be moved to the other side where the fans were blowing so the bugs would not get all over the food and was told as soon as table was ready we could.  A second waiter came out to discourage us from moving in a very condescending manner.  We did the appreciate the service and left.  Disappointed with service, lack of accommodation and only got to taste  a piece of bread before the nats took it.   It would be nice if you could wait in a cooler area also"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I wanted to love this place. I've heard nothing but praise from locals. Tonight was my second visit, and I can firmly say, \"I am not in love.\"

My first meal at MR was lunch with coworkers. I ordered a calzone. The crust was bland and the filling seemed sparse. I was underwhelmed but my coworkers raved about their dishes. I figured I should just order something else next time. C'est la vie.  

Tonight, a friend and I headed over to MR for dinner. I started off with bruschetta that tasted freshly made but had an overpowering acidic/vinegar flavor. The bread was already soggy like it had been sitting for a bit. My friend had calamari that she didn't care for at all.

We both ordered slow cooked brisket (I think the waitress said about 7 hours.) with grilled veggies and mashed potatoes. The entree was good, and the portion was huge...more than enough for two people. Leftovers are in my future. Of everything I've had at MR, this was the best. Still, I wasn't blown away by it. It was just good, not great.

On each visit the wait staff has been very friendly and attentive. Our waitress from tonight (wish I could remember her name) was super friendly and helpful. She did a great job.

My friend and I weren't complaining about the food but our waitress asked so we told her what we though of it. And the manager came out to tell my friend the calamari would be removed from her bill, and offered her a free dessert, which was a very responsible and nice gesture. I was mildly annoyed because I don't think she even acknowledged my presence. At this point it didn't even matter. I don't see a return in my future. 

I don't eat a lot of Italian food but next time I'm in the mood, I'm on to the next one."}
{"text":"Mama mia!  

Mama Ricotta's has been around for a while-vacillating between standard and pretty good Italian food.  I have to say, the past couple of times I have been eaten at Mama Ricotta's, it has been really great! They have stepped things up a notch or two, that's for sure.

The service is fast, friendly and consistent. The rolls they bring out have not changed. SO HARD to eat just one.  Impossible for some...

They have changed up the menu-adding some modern, lighter options but have kept their golden standards. My favorite is the chopped salad with romaine, gorgonzola, garbanzo beans and walnuts. The walnuts are chopped so finely, you can barely detect them. But they add this subtle nutty crunch that is outstanding. Calamari is great and the warm mascarpone dip is...drool worthy.

My husband always gets the penne a la vodka with chicken---every. single. time. The bites I snag are always excellent!

I also discovered a new favorite wine from their menu--Dreaming Tree Crush.  This red is delicious and subtly sweet.  Very easy to drink (maybe a little too easy).  It's actually a Dave Matthews collaboration!! 

If you haven't been to Mama Ricotta's in a while, you're in for a pleasant treat!!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried that many Italian restaurants in Charlotte yet, but this one is the best so far.  Low lighting creates a classic, relaxing atmosphere that is also suitable for families (meals can be served family style if you like).  The classic dishes are fantastic, but I haven't had great luck with the more original dishes (pork with grapes, while it sounded good on the menu, was not so tasty after all).  My food did come out burned once, but the waiter responded so apologetically and the turn around on a new dish was so fast that it didn't matter.  The manager came by shortly after as well and I think my meal was free  - customer service here is key.  It reminded me that a mistake in the kitchen won't ruin your meal if the people who work there care enough to fix it (looking at you Cabo Fish Taco!)"}
{"text":"We were looking for a casual, family friendly Italian spot for dinner and chose this place after reading the reviews. We were not disappointed. Very nice decor - the wood fired pizza oven between the bar and the dining room is a nice, rustic touch. 

Hubby and I really enjoyed the herbed rolls and olive oil that comes complimentary - the kid not so much, so we ordered garlic cheese bread. Since the kid wanted to skip the cheese, they added extra slices of the bread. That was much appreciated. The rooms and the bread were flavorful, soft and warm.  I started with the caprese (mozzarella & tomato appetizer on the menu), as that is always my measure of an Italian place. The tomatoes were ripe and the mozzarella very flavorful. I did have to add balsamic, as it only comes dressed with olive oil. 

The kid chose spaghetti with meat sauce (and a meatball). He liked the meatball a lot, though he complained the meat sauce was \"spicy.\"  The meat in the sauce did have a kick, so heads up if you have a kid in your party that's weird about stuff like that. 

Hubby had rigatoni with a bolognese sauce (he added ricotta) that he enjoyed. The meat in the bolognese had the same spice kick, but Hubby is a grown up and loved it. I ordered the cheese ravioli with a butter and sage sauce (you get a choice of sauces). It was amazing!  The butter sauce was a thin cream type sauce. I expected the sage to be fried crispy, but it was not. No matter, it was a terrific dish. 

Definitely a good place to enjoy a good Italian meal with the family. I wouldn't suggest it as a romantic date night spot though, it's much too loud on a busy night."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night, which also happens to be their scheduled \"Date Night\" deal. We decided not to go with the deal cause we already knew what we wanted. 

Calamari. 5/5 due to crispy edges and chewy squid! I was never a fan if an Italian place would overcook the squid. oh, and the marinara? YUM.

I had the ravioli and my boyfriend had the carbonara. Both super delicious, although a popular favorite is the penne a la vodka! All their sauces are creamy and well-seasoned.

Tiramisu. Holy crap this was by far the best tiramisu I've ever had, and I believe for that to solely be based upon the fluffyness of the cake, and lightness of the (whipped?) cream filling. 

the ONLY reason I didn't give this place a full 5 stars is due to the long waiting periods during our service. We were seated in the outdoor area (included a working fireplace in an insulated tent) and there were 2 waiters assigned. some times they came to our table at the same time or nonstop. then there were periods when we needed something, and they weren't anywhere to be found. very strange."}
{"text":"Great Italian food, carefully made with fresh ingredients. Pastas were perfectly cooked and graciously topped. I was pleasantly surprised by how great the food was and the waitress was very professional and outstanding. Portions was fairly large. The food was delicious and brought out in a timely manner (no over-lapping of courses), and we had a wonderful time overall :)"}
{"text":"Took the girls here for Mother's Day and sat on the patio, which is even more attractive with the new greenway. Unfortunately it rained so we could not take a walk after the meal. We had a reservation and were seated within 7 minutes. Excellent waitress, good food. A local favorite."}
{"text":"I love Italian and this dinner did not disappoint. We went on a Wednesday, and were happy to hear it was half price wine bottle night! Our waiter was wonderful and made several recommendations, including a Barolo which was excellent. I had the Penne Alla Vodka with chicken. The menu noted it was spicy, which I am sensitive to. Our waiter offered to have the chef skip the black pepper or scale it back. I chose to scale it back and it was the perfect choice. It still had a kick but not too much for me. My Dad also had the same meal and enjoyed it. Also per the waiter's recommendation, my husband had the Chicken Parmesan, which is his favorite. He thought the chicken was a bit dry but he still cleaned his plate. Our aunt had the same meal and also dry chicken. Overall we had excellent service and a very good meal. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We had such a lovely meal at Mama Ricotta's on Christmas Eve! We are very relieved to find such good Italian food here in Charlotte, NC...this place is on par with what we were used to having in Northern NJ/NYC and Chicago. Angel hair pasta was cooked to perfection with an absolutely perfect marinara sauce and phenomenal turkey prosciutto meatballs. We also had a lemon, white wine, artichoke chicken; very juicy and served on a bed of fluffy, cheesy, Heavenly polenta. Ratatouille was also cooked and seasoned to perfection and they did a fantastic job with the bread pudding and house made gelato. The portions at Mama Ricotta's are very large, prices reasonable...good drink menu too. We had very comfortable outdoor seating in front of a fireplace and prompt attentive service. I was totally impressed with what a saw in terms of their pizza menu and the indoor wood fired pizza oven which diners can sit near, in a bar type seating style. No question we will be visiting again soon!!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I were in town to visit a client and decided to check out this restaurant based on yelp reviews. Well we were not disappointed we both had their penne vodka with slight variations and it was amazing! Their cheesecake was also delicious!!"}
{"text":"A Charlotte Classic!  Everything on this menu is awesome!  I've been training for a race and have been \"carb loading\" I can't get enough of the Rigatoni with meat sauce and the Penne, Broccoli and Chicken.  I always end up with a to go box for lunch the next day.  

Mama if you read this bring back the Spedini Salad!

Oh and the pricing is pretty good for Catering!  We ordered several platters of pasta for a birthday bash.  Hot and yummy and way easier than cooking."}
{"text":"My wife's favorite Italian spot. She loves the penne ala vodka, made with pepper vodka!  Fresh baked bread is amazing.  Tried a slice ifU daughters pizza, very good!  Service is usually really good.  The last time we were there the server was slow but very friendly.  I would put this in the top 5 Italian eateries in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love the remodel. The food here is a bit simple but good for the style of Italian.
By simple I mean a bit bland. But the portions are excellent and the service is very good. Best for families. If you are looking for something creative or inspired this is not your place. But if it is a family dinner this is an excellent choice ."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant years ago. The food is a little on the salty side my last two visits. But it has very good classic Italian dishes."}
{"text":"I went here with a visiting cousin in early December. He had gotten a recommendation from another business traveller, so we gave it a shot. The meal was very good. The service was OK. The bread and oil were good, but the waiter was very puzzled by the request my cousin made to add grated cheese to the oil. The beer choices could have been better, but that is a perennial concern I have at most restaurants in Charlotte. Portions were reasonable, sauces good. It was a happy surprise to find out that the owning family was from the same area of NYS as we were, and we had a nice little exchange about \"home\". Desserts were killer. I was completely oblivious to the decor or muzak....but I was pretty much engulfed in a catching-up conversation with my cousin!
I plan on driving into town again to eat here...but since I live an hour out, it's not feasible for me to commute in *just* to eat very often. This is a place I would take guests to."}
{"text":"Overall didn't live up to everyone saying we must try. First I do want to say the bartenders were awesome and the server was nice. We decided to try for restaurant week and I think that was a mistake. Waiting I ordered a sangria, something was off and my husband smelt and tasted and agreed. The bartender tasted their mix and said the same so easy enough I substituted for a glass of wine. Got seated on time and sever was super friendly. We ordered all at once. Started with risotto balls they were really good. Then we got the penne vodka which was good but noodles were too al dente. The ravioli also came at the same time but were boarder line cold. The cheese inside was dense and not melted at all. Our server didn't bring the food so we didn't see her for 10mins. Then our food came, husband got chicken parm which was good but really can get that anywhere. I got the pork Ragu and the pork was tender but had no flavor and super dry. After 10mins of waiting for the server to check on us I finally told her and asked for a side of sauce, it took another 15 bc she had to come tell me there was an upcharge then go put it in. By the time it came my husband was done so I just had them pack it up. They said they were still working out the dishes for restaurant week since it was night one? Then we waited over 30 mins for them to bring us precut cake! We were pissed at that point because we had been then for An hour and half. Then the manager came over to basically tell me Ragu is usually dry... um no I get it everywhere and yes it's not saucy but not with a watery sauce with no flavor making the top noodles dry. They gave me the sauce with my box to eat later. The cake was ok kinda dry. Overall not impressed for my first visit. Literally every course but appetizers had an issue. I may try again not during restaurant week we will see."}
{"text":"The food was  good, I ordered a chicken parm and it was huge. The tiramisu was very good. I was satisfied with the portions. However I didn't find the chicken parm to be anything above average.

The service was good and attentive."}
{"text":"Amazing.  High quality, great prices, huge servings.  The crostini goat  cheese appetizer is probably the best appetizer I've ever had- huge portion, and delicious. 
I love their meat sauce- the combo of 3 meats is so savory, and filling.  The cheese ravioli is delicious. Their specials change all the time, so definitely ask.  You can find some scrumptious off the menu stuff that way. 
Love the servers, and the ambiance.  Great place for Date Night."}
{"text":"A little overpriced.  The food was overall pretty good. I know a few other Italian restaurants that I would pick first just because of price.  I wasn't disappointed with the food, just not extraordinary.  Service was good."}
{"text":"This was a good restaurant. I was with a group of about 10 people. Apparently on Wednesday there are 1/2 price wines so that was a plus. Appetizers were great, we had a samples platter with all the Italian staples. I had the veal Marsala which was a little sub par from what ice had in the past however I tried others' meals which were all great.  We had tiramisu and the Nutella cheese cake both of which were great but enough for all to share. 

All in all good restaurant and great for groups."}
{"text":"I recently went to Mama Ricotta's with a friend and a family member.  We ordered the full size chopped salad, a pizza, and a calzone.  Everything we ordered was terrific.  The chopped salad was full of vegetables and the dressing (the house vinaigrette) was fantastic.  The pizza was one of the best - perhaps the best - I have had in Charlotte.  I haven't found a Charlotte pizza place that I love (being from Chicago I am a total pizza snob), but I thoroughly enjoyed the Joe's special at Mama Ricotta's.  The bread and olive oil that they place on the table at the start of the meal are also really tasty...

The service was great.  Our server was attentive, and she was wonderful about getting us samples of a couple of types of wine.  It helped us to select a bottle that we ended up really enjoying.  

If I had a complaint, then it would only be about the cost of the wine.  The wine list is pricey, and that stood in sharp contrast to the prices of the entrees and appetizers - which I found to be very reasonable.  

All in all, this is a great find.  I would definitely recommend Mama Ricotta's if you are in the mood for good Italian food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"What is it with this place? It's like a weird mutant baby of Ruby Tuesday and the Cheesecake Factory born in 1994 - I swear they even have the same mix of fun n' funky jams you've heard in your favorite RT's playing in the background. They most definitely have the same feel - messy food paintings full of edgy, contrasty colors, that damn jewel tone color scheme that immediately calls to mind fancy Mall, opulent textures bandied about, willy-nilly. I've given Mama's three chances to transcend the bad decor choices with delicious foods, and she's failed me, every time.

Dinners - universally too salty, and if salts-everything-before-tasting-it me is saying that, well. This preserved, pickled thing is inescapable - if it isn't a preserved roasted pepper overwhelming your salad, it's a pickled artichoke or so many Kalamatas (yay Greece) smothering your pizza that any chance of digging on the housemade mozz is gone. Even Bruschetta tastes like it's been doused with anti-aging liquids and sat at the bottom of a very deep fridge for who knows how long.

In true Olive Garden style, salads are overdressed before making it to your table, so it's all a wilty, mixed up mess. That ain't how they do it in Italia, kids! That's how they do it in Bottomless Breadstickville.

Service is probably where they've spent the most energy and it shows - people are quick, smiley, knowledgeable. But try three was brunch this weekend, and the Benedict was so Stouffer's (accompanied by the blandest breakfast taters I've ever not eaten, and seriously, what cheese was that under my two asparagus spears, Muenster? Srsly?!) that, like I said, I give up. Che cosa una delusione."}
{"text":"I met my cousin here for lunch. She loves his place but I've never been. There doesn't seem to be a lot of parking- that for me can be a tad bit frustrating. The ambiance is soooooooo nice- it's really intimate, not loud, low lighting; definitely recommend for a date or brief business get together. The lunch prices are perfect- you get a lot for what you order. As for the dinner prices I'm not so sure. They looked a bit pricey to be getting the same serving size. I ordered the primavera pasta because I saw it in yelp. Boy was is tasty! Lots of veggies , how I like. I didn't get any protein added and I glad I didn't because you really don't need it . I was given 3 sauce options and I choose the basil and tomato sauce - as the waitress recommended. The staff was extremely attentive, service was exceptional! I even say the manager just going around and making sure everyone was okay and happy. 
I will definitely be going back here to try other Hong's on the menu."}
{"text":"Mama Ricotta's is consistently flavorful with good service. Normally, I'm here for lunch and get the pasta primavera. They are generous with the vegetables and portion size. The meat option to add to the primavera is not worth it, as I find the chicken as well as the shrimp to be rather bland. Additionally, the wait it never long and the staff is friendly. For $9, this is an economical lunch option.

During dinner, the line isn't usually too long. The food is delicious and the pastas are very hearty. I recommend the lasagna, as the portion size is filling. My favorite appetizer is the goat cheese and mascarpone dip. If you're not sharing, this could be a meal in itself. Best part of any meal are the garlic rolls. 2 bites size, warm, soft, and garlicky of course."}
{"text":"I called and asked what the soup of the day was as was told it was tomato cream , great I wanted soup and salad. When I got there and order the server said the soup was butternut squash,I told him I called and they said it was tomato, he said 'no'. He didn't even go check and in the kitchen to see if perhaps that was the soup at lunch time and they still had some , he just said No. we were hungry so we ordered dinner which was very good, just disappointed by the staff."}
{"text":"Great lunch recently at Mama Ricotta's.  This is a place I dined years ago when I lived in Charlotte and was thrilled to see things were as terrific as ever!   I look forward to having dinner there when I am back in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"If I could give a 4.5 star I would. Fantastic! I've been here a few times and each experience has been great. Let's start with the staff. Friendly and helpful. Beth, behind the bar, is so nice and really knows her stuff. The food. Ok, I'm jumping straight to dessert. Nutella  pie!! I could stop my review right there and still be at a 4 star. That's the real deal. The angel hair pasta dish does not disappoint. It's the pizza that has won my heart. The first time I ordered it, I glanced at the price for a large, 14 inch pie and was surprised at the almost $20 price tag but said to myself, everything else here has been unbelievable, so I'm going for it. Reminds me of the scene in Pulp Fiction when Vincent Vega asked \"Is that a $5 milkshake? We're talking milk and ice cream, right? (after tasting it), That's a great f*%@ing milkshake\".  Yep, you get what you pay for! I ordered the Joe's Favorite (no, it was already named that when I arrived). The homemade sausage is out of this world good. Great crust, wonderful flavor. One of the best pies I've ever had. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"The waitstaff were very nice but the food fell short. We had the bruschetta, shrimp scampi and Joe's favorite pizza. All of them were just okay, not great."}
{"text":"After living on Italy for two years I've just found a peace of Sicily in Charlotte. Because I like antipasto I order a plate that wasn't on the menu. The gently waitress did her best to convince the manager that accepted the request and thanks for the Chef that did a great job. It was an original antipasto that any Italian could value))) They have great wines and fresh beer.  But the service got from me this five stars review)))"}
{"text":"I used to work here about 10 years ago and it was and is the best Italian restaurant in Charlotte. It's not just that the food is unbeatable (I mean, who can have just one of those garlic knots?), but the owner and management are great. We always had such a great time working (it's easy when the food is good, you feel good about making recommendations). We also almost always bought some food before the kitchen closed and took it home! Now, when I come home to Charlotte I always try to get my parents to go there with me! Try going for lunch when the ginormous portions are a little smaller."}
{"text":"Delicious food (chicken parm and cheese pizza), paired with a bottle of wine (50% off ALL bottles on Wednesdays!)...SO GOOD! 
Service was great and the ambiance was really nice. Low lit, not too kitschy, music at the right volume. 
Highly recommended for Charlotte Italian and I will be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"It was slightly above average.  The bread and oil was decent.  I had the Pollo Bianco and it was amazing. Everything cooked to perfection!  My date had the Penne, Broccoli and Chicken and it was alright.  I thought it was a little dry and was looking for a creamy sauce that kept me going for more bites. Desert was awesome.  We had the chocolate cannoli and I highly recommend you to try that.  I thought it would be too rich but it was on point.  Our server was great and very knowledgeable. We took our time at the table and didn't feel that she was rushing us out the door.  I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"OMG. I finally found great pizza in Charlotte! :) The white pizza is amazing and their pepperoni is some sort of butcher fabulousness. Takeout was easy and quick. Will definitely be back soon for dine-in!!!"}
{"text":"It was pretty average Italian food, nothing to write home about. The bread they bring to the table before dinner wasn't very good.  No taste. I ordered the cheese ravioli and added two meatballs.  They were about the size of golf balls and pretty good but when I got my bill, they charged me $2 each for the meatballs! Craziness!"}
{"text":"For one of Charlotte's top rated Italian eateries, Their chef has a lot to learn about serving pasta. We ordered family style rigatoni with meat sauce. When they served the large platter there was barely any sauce, maybe one ladle in the middle. In Buffalo, we like a little pasta with our sauce. not the other way around!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Mama Ricotta's. They are the perfect place to dine with a larger group, as they take reservations and offer family style portions or individual portions.

The family style portions are reasonably priced and plenty for 3+ to share. We also love their fresh bruschetta. Their Caesar salad is great too. 

From pasta to dessert, and a date to a family dinner, we love their food!"}
{"text":"it was good. the bread was extremely fresh. tiramisu the best i have ever had!!  will return again in future."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW: We received a gift card to give it another try, so we went during restaurant week to get the best bang for our buck, and the chance to try more things. While nothing was crazy salty like our first experience, nothing we had blew us away either. Everything was completely average (except for the lemon blueberry tirimisu which neither of us cared for). Suffice to say, we'll be going elsewhere when we want good Italian."}
{"text":"This was the best dining experience that I have had in a long time!!
The salad and lasagne were delicious and the service was delightful. The servers all made me feel like they truly wanted me to enjoy my meal.
I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. One of the few/only places to get real Italian food. Plus not only do they know what Italian beef and giardiniera are, but have the sense to combine them on an amazing brick oven pizza. You will fight filling up on the bread and apps as they are amazing, but try and have restraint for the entrees. Love love love Mama Ricotta's - we always take family when they visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"Here on June 14, 2012.

Had amazing food here. Chicken breast dishes give enough food to bring home another meal.  Tasty food with traditional italian seasoning. Suace homemade and delicious. Easy to park. Has outdoor seating, too."}
{"text":"Great service and food, but the atmosphere left a little bit to be desired.  Maybe it's because I ate dinner at 6:00pm on a Tuesday and sat in the bar.  There just wasn't much going on, but this is a good thing, because my food was out in 10 minutes!

The Rigatoni was awesome and I'm a fan of the little rolls they bring.  The hand-packed ricotta added to the flavor of my dish and the dipping oil for the bread was a nice touch.  I didn't see much on the wine list to my liking, so I got a beer.  Decent selection on draft.

I'll be back for the lasagna soon..."}
{"text":"First time was amazing.. Great service and food!"}
{"text":"Really didn't expect this level of food and type of dining experience! 

We started with the goat cheese appetizer. Fluffy and creamy, it was the perfect start. 

I also decided to have a whiskey cocktail and I'm always nervous about cocktails. This one was excellent! Had either Rosemary or thyme and was just perfect. 

My husband and I split a salad with salmon on top And the short rib gnocchi. They were both excellent. The short rib fell right off the bone and the gnocchi was full of flavor and pillowy. 

Last, we shared Nutella and chocolate pie slices. The slices were huge!!! Definitely preferred the Nutella pie over the chocolate pie. 

Service was great and it was just a lovely experience and sit down meal. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed here. It's so well priced especially if you get the family style. Their appetizers are so good and I haven't had a main pasta dish that I don't like. The carbonara is my favorite for sure."}
{"text":"Y'ALL CLEARLY HAVE NEVER EATEN OUTSIDE OF CHARLOTTE. Mama ricotta's is a 1/2 step above olive garden, now ive never eaten at an oliver garden but thats what i imagine. its pretty standard mediocre italian food that emphasizes alot of heavy cream to create flavorful dishes, which is just so not italian. 

Not that there is anything wrong with mediocre italian food, it fills you up, but 4 stars is crazy. Both times ive had the penne alla vodka, once again its pretty mediocre. 

Fried calamari was fried calamari, it did not kill me, but i laughed when they served it with hellmans chipotle mayo as the side (hello cocktail sauce? maybe a tomato sauce?). 

I will say its rather inexpensive so compared to a luce or vivace i can see this being a fan fav."}
{"text":"Absolutely scrumptious! One of my co-worker recommended this place to me several months ago.. and I finally got around to dining here! I love the atmosphere- family photos adorn the walls, fine, white clothes and tableware set the tables. The wine barrel semi-wall is really neat. The restaurant is segregated into various areas, such as the pizza bar with someone stretching and throwing dough in front of you, high tables, low tables and a wine cellar area. 

Now to the food- 
I started with the fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and basil- fresh and delicious. 
Pasta Primavera with cream sauce- angel hair pasta with fresh veggies cooked to perfection and tenderness with nicely seasoned creamy sauce. Oh my goodness, I will be returning! So worth it. 
I believe my friend ordered the Penne Alla Vodka, which wasn't anything spectacular. We tried each other's entrees and she loved mine. 

Next time I visit, i'll try and save room for dessert. 

Staff was welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"I had a reservation for 3, I changed it to 2, but it wasn't updated in the system when we arrived (I had called too to let them know) Whatever no problem. They seated us at an awkward table for 6 outside in a cold corner. We ate here for our wedding anniversary, so I hated we didn't get a better table with our reservation. 

Service was average. I had the chicken parm and goat cheese polenta & it was very good. Big portion sizes. I tried their chocolate martini & it was SOOO weak they might as well have given me a glass of milk. :(  ! 

All in all a good meal but not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"i enjoy the food from Mama's it is my go to place for a good meal and wonderful service."}
{"text":"The food and the Server Ben was AMAZING!!! the only thing I would change is have something like crayons available for the children for the waiting on the main course.. Other than that it was the Bomb!"}
{"text":"I'm in NC for business, and asked around for a good italian place - This was told to me as \"the best Italian in charlotte\"

We took a walk over there and noticed this nice place at the corner of a strip mall. Lots of well dressed people inside, so it must be a decent place right?

Wait staff was good and attentive, and quick.

Everything was just OK. Bread and olive oil/vinagerette dip were OK, Goat cheese and bread appetizer, just ok. 
I had the veal milanese, with arugula and onions, and a  side of asparagus (4 dollars for like 7 little baby 'gus's). Only ok. 

They had a special on beers \"All Italian beers on sale\"
-what italian beers do you have?
Peroni. Thats it. Hardly a special.

Not bad, but wouldnt visit again. All the dishes were typical with no risks, and no reward."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go--food and service are always great.  Wednesday night, half price bottles of wine.  Families, date night, special celebration, this place is home--they treat you well.  The hostess is always pleasant and helpful.
We sat on the patio tonight.  Shared the Tuscan Salad and then the Rigatoni with meat sauce.  You will be taking a doggy back because the portions are big! It was my BDay, so they brought me a cannoli--wonderful night!  A restaurant that's great for the family to gather, the service is always happy and courteous--great food and value!!!
With this nice warm weather, maybe go on a patio tour-who has the best patio in Charlotte!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very delicious. However, the salt content proved to be a bit extreme.  Great service!!"}
{"text":"Great food, fine cocktails, excellent service provided by Kelly.  We noticed this place fairly close to our hotel. I looked up the Yelp reviews and decided to check it out. Good choice."}
{"text":"Stopped by for take out. Our Air B&B hosts suggested it as a dinner for the two of us to share. We are in town on business and dinners are late.

Ordering was easy and it was ready with no wait when we called ahead.

We split the angel hair pasta with two huge turkey meatballs. It was good and made for three meals. I ordered the Momma's salad (or something with a similar name) and it was okay. I'd skip it next time."}
{"text":"Very very good. A tiny bit pricy for italian food but none the less it was very tasty"}
{"text":"I went here with my dinner group of 10 people. We were given the most delicious bread with a nicely spiced olive oil.  I ordered the ravioli, which was cheese filled and offered a choice of 3 sauces.   I chose butter and sage.  Very good and quite a sizeable portion.   I did leave one ravoili on the plate to be lady like ; )  But, I wish that I had better less greedy so that I could have enjoyed leftovers the next day!"}
{"text":"Most over-rated Italian food (or just restaurant in general) in Charlotte. 

I would say that Mama Ricotta's is just marginally better than The Olive Garden. Don't even bother wasting your time here unless you like burnt, watery, flavorless sauce. 

I got chicken parmesan. The chicken part was really good however, the sauce was AWFUL. 

My wife got pene ala vodka and it was just OK. 

The service was excellent for how busy they were! 

Nothing special here.

My favorite part honestly was the salad. They had a really good dressing. 

If you want the real deal, go to OGGI!!!!! 

(I am 100% Italian and grew up eating home-cooked Italian food so I am pretty picky when it comes to this)"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this place is SO GOOD! I came here for New Years Eve and ate my little heart out!  Everything, from the appetizer of bread with ricotta and tomato sauce to the pasta and salad, was absolutely DIVINE. An absolute must try!! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Someone at the photo shop down the road recommended Mama Ricotta's for lunch, so my son and I went. My son is a college kid, so he wanted pizza. It was fabulous. Now we go every time we make the trip to Charlotte (an hour) for camera gear. He has taken a couple of friends as well.  

My son could eat the bread and flavored oil all day. It is really good. The pizza which is what we always get is terrific too. So, I can't speak to the other dishes, but they look great. I want to try some of those soon. 

Every server we've had has been terrific both inside and on the patio. They have a cover on the patio and a fireplace going when it's cold. That's where we ate last time and really enjoyed the outdoor feel."}
{"text":"Recently, my husband and I decided to grab a quick meal prior to the theater. We chose to go to one of our very favorite restaurants- Mamma Ricotta's.
We can always count on a delicious meal and great service. Friday night was no exception. The wait staff is generally very good, however, Friday we had Ben and he was exceptional. From the moment we were seated he was attentive, efficient, knowledgeable and fun. He made certain  we had  a scrumptious, meal  and excellent wine and still had plenty of time to get to the theater!"}
{"text":"I must start off by saying we have enjoyed the food very much each time we have ate here!
Tonight we really weren't happy with the service that we received while eating dinner. I asked a few questions about the menu and the servers response were incorrect or asking me a question back. When you are paying $20+ per dish you want to make sure you will enjoy your food or at least I want to know. I asked what polenta was because obviously I've never heard of it and servers response was \"you never heard of polenta\" and than goes on to tell me it potatoes that had a sauce on them. Well hate to break it to you but I goggled it as soon as she walked away and come to find out \"she didn't know what is was either\". 
I find it kind of rude to ask the same question to a customer that they asked you than make up what the food is and not go ask what it was. Few other questions we asked about the menu such as do you have a house salad? Response was you can just pick any of them. Well come to find out the one we picked dressing couldn't be changed than goes to tell us which one is the house salad that we could actually pick our dressing for. I could go on and on of smart remarks and incorrect information that was given during this dinner but I will stop here. With this said hopefully they see this review and get their servers on board with knowing their menu."}
{"text":"What a nice treat! The bread, to start, was fresh and seasoned with Italian herbs, and served with olive oil & red pepper flakes, yummy! The shrimp and crab risotto was delicious, creamy & buttery, a true risotto. We also ordered the Pollo Alla Griglia, a seasoned grilled chicken, served with mashed potatoes & the vegetable of the day, which I substituted for the grilled asparagus, delish! The service was great and the wine selection perfect! An enjoyable evening in the patio, and somewhere we will return!"}
{"text":"Went during charlottes restaurant week, it was just OK. The marinera sauce was bland...their pizza is great tho :)"}
{"text":"Went with a huge group, where we dined family style. I was able to try multiple offerings, and every single item was fresh and delicious. A great staple in the Charlotte area for a night with friends, a place to bring out of town guests, and bigger parties for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!! Thank you Yelp for the recommendation. My daughter and I felt like we walked into grandmas kitchen as we entered the front door. The smell alone brought back so many memories. Our waiter Ben was top notch! The service was by far the best I've ever experienced. Our tastebuds were in heaven the entire meal. The bruschetta and homemade mozzarella is to die for as well as the Rigatoni with meat sauce. This will be a regular spot whenever we are in town. It's totally worth the wait!!!!!! I must admit that all of the other diners left with to go boxes except us. We were so full, yet kept saying just one more bite! Thank you for a awesome experience and the perfect ending to our mother daughter day."}
{"text":"Perhaps they need more staff at night. I waited 15 minutes for them to cut 2 pieces of tiramisu to go."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today with my wife. We started with the bruschetta and the toppings were good. The bread was very soggy as if it sat on the line for a few minutes, but overall it was good.
We both ordered the pollo carciofi which was good. The mix of flavors and the lemon were smooth and we enjoyed. It was however pretty salty. I believe artichoke hearts are salty and were included, but if you know that, back off the salt. Would go back again, service was really good and friendly staff. This was our first visit here."}
{"text":"Very good local favorite for Italian.  The bad news is that everyone else in Charlotte knows that.  The good news is that they accept reservations.  

Like Buca Di Beppo, they offer many of their dishes as large family style options. Unlike Buca Di Beppo, they also offer everything as an entree for one.  And the food is significantly better.  

I loved the complimentary bread brought to the table which tasted like small soft dinner rolls brushed with garlic.  The olive oil with a hint of crushed red pepper was a great companion to the bread.  My chicken Parmesan was excellent, although with a slight imbalance between cheese and sauce. (More sauce please!)

All in all, an excellent option for a great Italian meal in Charlotte and one I hope to revisit on a future trip."}
{"text":"Bookmarked for six months, I was finally in this part of town and in the mood for Italian food. It was an excellent choice and I have to double recommend the warm goat cheese and mascarpone dip to start. Excellent, excellent, excellent!

I had the ricotta with meat sauce as my main. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was excellent. I asked for the added scoop of ricotta cheese but it really wasn't necessary with the freshly grated cheese on top. Lots of pasta, it went home in a box and was a full lunch meal the next day.

My wife chose the pork chop special, which was served with sliced apple in a delicious sweet gravy. Absolutely excellent and again, more than enough to take home.

Service was excellent and the food was excellent. I'm sure we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Mama's is participating in Restaurant Week with a four-course meal for $30.00.  I took a peek at the menu and thought I'd give it a whirl.

I made reservations (which were probably not necessary) through Open Table for early Sunday evening.  I was seated immediately and my server came out to take my drink order.  There were three options for the first course, two for the second, four for the third and three dessert options for the final course.  I made my selections and the waiter left to put in my order.
He returned quickly with what appeared to be some soft yeast garlic rolls with some olive oil for dipping.  Soon the bruschetta, my first course, arrived.  It was the tastiest bruschetta I've ever had.  Heaps of diced tomatoes and basil protecting two pieces of toasted Italian bread, drizzled with olive oil.  They set the bar high up front.  Unfortunately, the next course didn't meet the same status.  I had chosen the penne a la vodka pasta which was rather mild in taste.  The one saving grace was the pieces of pancetta scattered throughout the dish.  The third dish helped bring us back closer to our starting point.  The veal milanese was very simple with a veal cutlet pounded out, lightly breaded and fried, topped with arugula, cherry tomatoes and Parmesan cheese.  The cutlet was huge and left me enough for dinner the following night.  I ended my meal with the nutella pie, a delightful combination of nutella, marscapone, and peanut butter in a graham cracker crust.  Fantastic.

The food was very good and the service was excellent.  The location was a little difficult to find, but it's worth the reward."}
{"text":"I moved to Charlotte almost 5 years ago and just had my first Mama Ricotta's experience. I know, this practically still makes me a Charlotte rookie. I have heard so many of my friends rave about this place, and it's been on my list for some time now. When my dear friend Jessie invited the boodle and I to join them for NYE dinner at MR's, I just couldn't say no. Mama Ricotta's and good company... sign me up!

We had a 6:30pm reservation and the boodle and I arrived about 15 minutes early. I wasn't sure what to expect with the place being in a strip mall. It was warm, inviting, and beautifully decorated inside. Exceeded my expectations for sure. 

We were seated promptly at 6:30pm and our server was incredibly friendly. MR's was offering a NYE menu as an option, but it was not required. Jessie and I did order the NYE cocktail special which was a black cherry champagne beverage; it was delicious. The fresh bread that came to our table was a garlic-y, buttery bread. It was so good! 

I am rather plan when it comes to meal time. I stuck with the classic Angel Hair Pasta was homemade tomato basil sauce. It was so good! Boodle ordered the short rib over gnocchi and it was amazing. I had a few bites and wished I had ordered it. 

There is plenty of parking at Mama Riccotta's and everyone there was really friendly."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for restaurant week last week. It was delicious! First off, their menu had 4 courses and all the portions were large! I took my entree for lunch the next day. I chose the blueberry lemon tiramisu. This isn't normally on the menu, but I think it should be. It was delicious! I also enjoyed the chicken piccata. What really made the experience was our waiter, Ben. He had to be one of the most friendly and happy waiters! His energy completely made the night! I can't wait to go back for another dinner."}
{"text":"Since last Queen's Week fiasco, I've been ordering the lunch penne alla vodka to split with the bf and it is delicious on the regular. 5/5 stars for this. I decided to return for Mama Ricotta's new Queen's Feast Menu since they have been doing so well with their normal service and food. We decided to have an early dinner before they were overwhelmed with Restaurant Week diners during their normal dinner hours. 

At 5:30p, we were seated in a booth right away and our server filled our water glasses and brought out those meh tasting garlic buns (might want to season the oil dip)...The server was very attentive throughout the meal and filled our water glasses more than a couple of times despite the incoming dinner crowd. This was kinda of an odd meal for me and I couldn't evaluate it as much as I would have liked because I got my first medical school acceptance phone call before the first course came out and I was a little dazed (but yay!) sorry not as many pics this time! 

Appetizer: 
Tomato Soup: nothing special at all..very rustic style tomato soup. This comes in a very small cup and I never received the crostini that was supposed to come with it. 
Arancini: the bf liked it but, I thought it needed more seasoning. Good sized portion though. 

Second Course: 
Penne alla Vodka: definitely not as good as the regular penne alla vodka quality. The sauce was a little soupy and a tiny bit bland. 

Entree: 
Tomato and Shrimp Risotto: very al dente, almost undercooked. The shrimp was cooked and seasoned perfectly though. The bf didn't really like the fishy taste from the risotto, I'm guessing they used seafood stock for this. I didn't mind it as much. 

Dessert: 
Lemon Blueberry Tiramisu: I was hesitant to try it but, it was actually really good. Very refreshing with its take on fruit. 
Nutella Cannoli: Very good! The filling was delicious, the perfect combination of crunchy and sweet. 

It was an ok Queen's Week Meal. I wouldn't really get anything again besides the desserts and the penne alla vodka."}
{"text":"Great food! And they probably have one of the bet lasagna a in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"On two separate occasions I have attempted to come to this establishment.  The first time was Restaurant Week so I understood they were busy and there were no tables available...no problem.  Saturday solidified  the fact that I will never attempt to go there again.  We were searching for a dinner spot and decided we wanted Italian.  We are aware it's usually packed so  we called first to assess the wait.  We were told by the person on the phone that there was no wait so we headed right over.  We arrived 10 minutes afterwards and there was suddenly nothing available nor did the hostess offer to take our names just in case something came up.  She kept telling us we could sit at the bar. When we explained we just called the hostess began to tell me about other patrons that had reservations, which had nothing to do with the fact that I'd just called and confirmed availability.  Ultimately there was no sense of customer service and I was very disappointed with her tone and the way she handled our visit.  To avoid ruining a perfectly good day we left and found a location that could offer the level of service we deserved."}
{"text":"My husband read this is the best Italian in NC, so we didn't mind driving to Charlotte to see for ourselves. It is wonderful! Great food, Amber is a fantastic server, ambience is lively and lovely. If you haven't tried Mama Ricotta, please do!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Looks can be deceiving. I avoided this place (even though I heard it was good) b/c of the name and location.

Lucky for me, I was bored on a Monday and felt daring. Very nice interior, extremely friendly/hospitable service, and very good food. 

I really liked the goat cheese app. and I will be going back here again."}
{"text":"OMG. SO DELICIOUS!!

We made reservations with open table, so we were seated within minutes.

Our server, Mikayla, was wonderful! She was able to explain the menu while steering us to specific dishes based off what we told her we liked. She was quick and attentive - the staff continued to pour our wine glasses full for us and the manager came by to ask how everything was going - perfect service!

The food was unbelievable! I've had pasta before, but not like this - everything was superb!! My only regret is we had no room for dessert after this meal.

The best tip about this place: I signed up for their eNewsletter online and in the first email had a free appetizer coupon to use!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and stumbled upon Mama Rocottas. I had no idea what to expect but I was quickly sat with the ever so lovely David. My wine never went empty and he was pleasure to talk to! Which that's all a gal can ask for really, good conversation and a wine glass that never goes empty. Plus, my entree which David recommended to me was awesome! I had enough to take to work with me the next day, YUM! If y'all are ever in charlotte give it a try but make sure to ask for David. You won't be disappointed! Give this man a raise!"}
{"text":"The food was good and plentiful. Waitress was friendly, and kept checking us and refilling my sweet tea glass( this is a pet peeve when I have to ask). We ordered the calamari appetizer, chicken parm and chicken cioffa, and bread pudding for dessert. All items can easily be shared."}
{"text":"An enjoyable Saturday evening dinner for four. Bruschetta very good.  Lasagne hit the mark, Chicken carciofi also very good.  Two other chicken dishes were a bit underwhelming.  W"}
{"text":"Synopsis:  Better than average food and service, but you are going to pay for it.

Mama Ricotta's (or as I call her, Mama) is literally one of the first places I ever ate in Charlotte.  Unlike a lot of places in Charlotte, they got better over the last 15 years, not worse.

The best way for me to describe their changes over the years has to be: intelligent.

Their growth was intelligent because they kept the items which were successful, and rotated in new favorites while changing with the times.  A lot has changed over the past 15 years regarding what people in America are looking for in food, they've been able to stay relevant while not losing their credibility and identity.

As for value, it is in line with other quasi-casual Italian restaurants around Charlotte, which (IMHO) are all generally over priced, there are some more fairly priced options but you do have to look for them a bit more.

All in all you should not be upset with your experience at Mama's."}
{"text":"Excellent place.  Food is solid.  Service is great.   Just outside uptown - Uber cost covered by the non-uptown prices.  We are going to be here regularly."}
{"text":"To start off, the front of house staff is amazing, we were a few minutes late for our reservation but they held our table and seated us with smiles. Very friendly and helpful. Our waitress Diana, pointed out her favorites on the menu but also gave us information about any other dish we wanted to know about. I never once had to ask for a refill, it's like she knew what I wanted before I had to ask for it. If I'm not coming back just for the food alone, it was for the outstanding service."}
{"text":"I made a reservation a couple of hours before we planned on arriving - a Thursday evening.  We got hungry, so we decided to go early - assuming it wouldn't be THAT busy on a Thursday night.  We were pretty wrong.  We were told that it would be 30 minutes (basically the same time we had reserved).  No big deal - to the bar to grab a drink.

Four minutes later, we were told that our table was ready.  Great - except, I need to close out at the bar...and if we would have known we would be seated so quickly, I would have waited and just ordered a bottle of wine.  Oh well, to the table with my beer in hand.

Sat down - got waters and bread/olive oil (which was great).  I ordered a small Caesar salad and the chicken parm.  The other three split a full salad (it was huge...if there's three of you, you don't need the family size salad) and had their entrees or pastas.

Pastas can be single serve if you're hungry.  I was able to finish half of the chicken parm (basically one piece of chicken and half of the pasta).  We all ended up taking three boxes home after passing on the desserts.  

A couple qualms.  Even on a Thursday night, the place was crowded (not so bad) - but it was loud...very loud.  We would have probably stayed and had dessert or another drink, but we could barely hear each other anyway - so we did not.  The restaurant is very dark.  Maybe people (other tables) were using their phones to read the menu.  Many it is part of the ambiance - but, other restaurants have \"light up\" menus.  

Was the food good? - Yes, it was great.
Service good? - Yes.
Good value? - Yes, chicken parm entree was $20 something, but gave me two good size meals.
Other issues? - Yes, loud and dark.
Would I go back? - For sure, with the right set of people.  It's much more of a friends place to go.  I wouldn't do a first date or meal with the rents.

P.S. - I ate the leftover chicken parm for lunch today - it was still great!"}
{"text":"I heard of this place but had never indulged myself until recently. We were seated immediately and once we ordered our food after 5 minutes, we received our food after 3 minutes! Literally, I've never gotten great food so quickly! I was impressed, so I will definitely be back."}
