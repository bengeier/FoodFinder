{"text":"Kind of surprised at the bad reviews, but this place is packed on weekdays. I ordered the Pho and it was prepared differently than the usual style I like, but it was pretty decent. One of my colleagues ordered one of the grilled dishes and it was delicious (according to him)."}
{"text":"Nourriture honnête et pas dispendieuse. Il faut amener son vin. La soupe royale aux crevettes et noix de coco était délicieuse. Le serveur m' a proposé de commander aussi des lanières de buf car c' était de tradition de tremper le buf dans le soupe. Ce fut une bonne suggestion. Mon Pad Thai au poulet était aussi très bon. La portion était tellement grosse que j' en ai ramener la moitié a la maison. ma voisine de table a bien aimé son sauté de légumes au poulet. le service a été très efficace mais difficile d' avoir le service en Français. Le stationnement est difficile en avant."}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price. The place is busy but not so busy that you won't find a table.   Lunch menu is limited to speed up service.   Lemon Grass beef on vermicelli is a personal favourite.   The owner has a unique sense of humour and always works the cash.  Bring your own wine."}
{"text":"\"Manager\" felt the need to come to my table and explain, at length, how an ordering mix-up was my fault and that they would not allow me to switch my meals.   A simple \"no\" would have been fine and I would have been on my way eating the (mediocre) food that I didn't want.... But when you feel the need to go the extra mile and berate me at my table and be a complete a$&@ole in front of my family, that's when I draw the line. You were beyond rude and I hope this review costs you far more than the $9 you would have had to spend to comp the meal I did not want."}
