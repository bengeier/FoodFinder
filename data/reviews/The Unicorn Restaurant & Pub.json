{"text":"I ate there with my parents tonight for the first time. The service was outstanding. My dad had the Reuben and my mom had the perch. My wife had blackened chicken Alfredo. The food was very good. This restaurant reminds me of a higher-quality supper clubs in the Midwest. I feel the prices were very fair and the sides they came along with our meals were great."}
{"text":"Had the Reuben and the French onion soup. Was so delicious! Highly recommend ! Service was awesome too. My son had the Shepherds pie which was great too!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Siri, because there was no sign denoting the Unicorn, except a packed parking lot. What was recommended to us as a steakhouse happened to have an Irish flair, just perfect for the Sweeney's and McGivern's in attendance.  Ryan enjoyed a huge cut of prime rib, and I had the bourbon salmon. The prime rib was cooked as requested and fresh and flavorful. The salmon was well prepared and the whipped Yukons were perfect. Try the Colcannon: whipped potatoes with cabbage and kale. Irish eyes were smiling!  We all shared a wonderful meat and cheese platter, and unlike many we have had, it was packed with many different meats and cheeses - plenty for 4 to share.   The service was good and the old world, dated interior lent itself to the fun of a hidden gem.   One area for improvement: the Guiness was a little too cold."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while and I don't know why we waited so long to go back. The food was excellent. Generous portions and not too pricey. The service was attentive. Did not have to ask for anything twice. We went here for the potato skins. They were excellent as was everything else. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was here for a private party, but the food was excellent. I had the Lake Erie Perch and my wife had the Chicken Cordon Bleu. Both were excellent. The atmosphere is cool. The service was excellent. Next time I'm in town I will definitely stop here."}
{"text":"Have eaten here 3 times, excellent food. The Clam Chowder is the best I've had in Ohio, wish I was in the area more often.  The prime rib sandwich, Rueben and burgers are great. Service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Don't expect a fancy restaurant... it's more old school in the country.  BEST PART: GREAT SERVICE  Excellent steak! Food overall is impressive."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and stop into this Irish themed restaurant for some prime rib. It's to die for. This isn't some fancy 5-star restaurant, but fits in perfect in Grafton.  Other favorite meals: fettuccine alfredo, fish and chips.  Great bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"It is so nice to find a restaurant that withstands the passage of time.  We went there last night and found it just as wonderful as ever.   The service was outstanding. There were a variety of appetizers. The coconut shrimp were huge; the stuffeded mushrooms were yummy. The meal was  delicious. Two of us got the gaelic steak which was tender,  flavorful with a delicious sauce that did not over power the steak.   The fresh baked loaves of bread were a nice addition. Unfortunately we couldn't eat another bite. ...so we didn't order dessert.   The atmosphere was comfortable and cozy. A great experience for food and service."}
{"text":"The Unicorn has been a Grafton staple for years. Service is always good, and the food plentiful.  On this occasion I got the Fish and Chips. Decent but I think the fish could use a bit more seasoning and it seemed a little underdone. The fries were okay. A bit over cooked and I may have gotten the last of a batch.  My dinner companions enjoyed their meals quite a bit. Next time I'm there I'll opt for something else."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner! Had the perch dinner and it was great. Service was out of this world. Can't wait for our next meal at the unicorn."}
{"text":"The Unicorn has been my brother and my annual stopping place for the \"kick off the holiday\" meal.  We never have a reservation and are always quickly seated.  Our standard is the filet mignon and baked potato meal and it has NEVER failed to satisfy.  In fact, I have had filet at many more pricey restaurants and often they don't measure up to the one I had at The Unicorn.  The wait staff is very attentive and the food is served quickly.  This is an Irish Pub and they do serve Irish fare.  The bar area always seems to be lively and full."}
{"text":"We came here for a banquet for a private party. The food was absolutely delicious - a type of Gaelic chicken and fresh sides. The service was good and friendly and the atmosphere, while dark, was open and welcoming."}
{"text":"Love the Old World atmosphere! I usually get the Reuben sandwich and it's fantastic. The corned beef they use is great quality. I've also had the quessadilla and it is always satisfying. I've always received good, friendly service here, too."}
{"text":"Epic road trip stop 2. The pooch and I were in need of sustenance. This place looked perfect. A neighborhood Irish pub in rural Lorain county. This place is authentic Irish, not faux Irish like Flannery's or the Harp. The bar felt like a medieval inn from a movie like Willow or Monty Python's Holy Grail. Yet it still had this Lorain county-veterans drink here-stop taking pictures with your phone you city slicker vibe to it. Very dark inside, even at 11:30 in the morning. I ordered the perch sandwich to go with Uni-fries(waffle fries) and pounded a GLBC Conway Irish ale while i waited. They offer a Uni burger(which i assumed was my most coveted lifelong delicacy, unicorn meat), but I still went with fish. Order was up quick as hell before i could even finish my brew! Great service. Total was ten bones.   Sandwich was small, but tasty. It had some sort of house tartar sauce that was delectable.  They gave me a pickle, ample fries, and a reason to talk about unicorns for a week. So glad i stopped in."}
