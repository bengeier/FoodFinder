{"text":"The atmosphere is relaxed and inviting and the service was impeccable. A nice vice sand excellent place to hang out in.  I tried a few things :  - Their onions rings are very good. Prepared well, spicy mayo sauce was on point... YUMMY!  - Jerk chicken is SPICY... then again, I can't take spicy at all but it was spicy. Can't comment either way, I didn't know what I was getting myself into. LOL.  - The asian drink not for me, it tasted weird, tried another drink with gin afterwards, it was really good.  Overall, a good experience!"}
{"text":"Really great option in this area. Tucked upstairs on Duluth across from Reservoir this place successfully combines great food in a good looking but comfortably divey atmosphere, super friendly staff, some fun and affordable cocktails. I wish there were more local beer options but they've made a fair start. I think maybe there is fun dancing here, I hope and pray this is the case.   I tried the jerk chicken and it was badass, crispy skin, delicious jerk sauce nice and spicy on a bed of rice and beans, salad on the side to cool things down, super filling portion, really lovely with The Kentucky Pear cocktail. I was so happy that the food was this good, can't wait to hang here again."}
{"text":"Unique cocktails and great bites!   I ordered the Canard Buffalo, duck in buffalo sauce with blue cheese sour cream and pickled jalape√±o. They were spicy! It was a small bowl of three drumsticks covered in the special sauce. Very tasty.  The fries and mayo are delicious!!!! Fries are large slices of potatoes.  The Michelada is like a margarita but with a bit of beer inside. I do taste the beer... To me it's odd. I might prefer the Asian Mary, which is a blend of wasabi, soya sauce, and other juices. That was nice to sip on. The Kentucky Pear (bourbon, Belle de Brillet, apple juice, and more pear juice) was very sweet.  Wonderful service!! I like the vibe of this dive bar, it's super clean and serves delicious food."}
