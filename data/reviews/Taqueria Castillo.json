{"text":"I love this place randomly discovered it on the way home. I've had the burrito , Carne Asada fries, tacos, torta, Sonoran dog, and pi√±a loca. This place has the best Carne Asada fries in phoenix the only thing I really don't like here is the tacos not much flavor. But I love everything else highly recommend."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by small amount of reviews. This place is legitimately amazing and delicious. Yes the area is questionable but never felt uncomfortable or uneasy on sunday 10pm. 

Very humble and nice workers.

They accept credit/debit card. Definitely a big plus.

As for the food:
Sonoran Hot Dog: (the best I've had so far in phoenix). I've never been to a hot dog place that grilled the bun. It was unique and yet an amazing idea. Ir reminded me of a Texas toast with the flavor of your usual sweet Sonoran bun. The problem with Sonoran hot dog is that you rarely taste the actual hot dog(wiener/frank/sausage or however you refer to it), here you could taste the bacon wrapped hot dog. The beans are simmered in chorizo which adds a twist to the usual sonoran dogs I've tasted. They add the usual tomato, onion, mustard, ketchup, mayo and guacamole. 
Definitely a most. 

They name themselves a Taqueria. So we had to taste the tacos. We had pastor, asada, cabeza and tripitas. They had authentic street taco flavors. The asada and pastor were definitely the winners. The pastor was not your typical pastor/adobada flavor but very good. Their salsa are very tasty. The red is really spicy but with the taste you would expect of a mexican street taco place. 

Overall the hot dogs were the winners. Too bad they advertise themselves more like a taqueria than a hot dog place. But try this its definately a must. A plus is Fridays and Saturdays they are open until 3 am!!!"}
{"text":"This taco truck deserves 5 stars all around! The food alone is so delicious! $1.50 each for carne asada tacos. They are pretty small but they are so worth it. They also serve other things as well but the tacos are my go to! They have an enclosed tent with a tv for dining in. 

You won't be disappointed with tacos here! Yum!"}
{"text":"My wife and i have visited twice before and we have yet to be disappointed, the food is great for the price and the atmosphere is relaxing. I usually get the sonoran hot dogs and asada tacos. I have tried the asada torta before and its great. They serve horchata, chompurrado and mexican coke, plus a few other drinks."}
{"text":"This taco stand is at a perfect location for me when I want a late snack but don't want fast foods. The carne asada tacos are my favorite tacos to get here. For a $1.50 each it can seem pricey to other people but once you taste the taco  you understand why it's ok to spend $1.50 per taco
The sitting area is really nice in winter months here in AZ they have standing heater lamps everywhere while you eat Ina enclosed tent. They also have a TV set up mainly(Spanish shows) but very nice set up. In the summer months they have fans installed above the enclosed tent which is pretty awesome because most taco stands don't have these amenities. 

The sitting area is always clean, the outside of the taco truck is always organized which makes me feel good because it leads me to believe the inside of the taco truck is clean."}
