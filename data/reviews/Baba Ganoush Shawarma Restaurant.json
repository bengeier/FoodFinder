{"text":"terrible food... over priced   mashed potato with no milk or butter really? under cooked french fries your favorite? a garden salad that's bigger then the main course? 5 small pieces of chicken breast kabob... 1 pita bread for 2 plates?  i would NEVER pay 35$ again for 2 plates of terribly prepared food  i will never suggest this place to anyone who is hungry  this order was for takeout and it will be the FIRST and LAST time ever going to this terrible establishment."}
{"text":"A shawarma shop without shawarma, saying they stopped serving it for the night despite over two hours left before closing.  No wonder it was empty.  I left."}
{"text":"Amazing delicious food! Had the turkey plate. Was served with a whole wheat pita and house salad to start off. Then came the main dish.   Never had shawarma like this! It came monster portions. A long plate half lined with well cooked yellow rice and the other half was again lined with big portions of turkey meat well cooked. Came with three side sauces: tamarind sauce, yogurt sauce and hot sauce.   Highly recommended!  Pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I have become a regular at this restaurant for two main reasons, the falafel and the grilled eggplant. Both the best in the GTA (And I have been to A LOT of falafel places). The location is a bit strange, but once there the food is great.   Besides the food, the two owners/chefs are incredibly friendly, I receive a wave and greeting every-time I walk in (along with most people), it gives it a small town friendly restaurant vibe.  The prices are very reasonable and the portions are usually quite difficult to completely finish."}
{"text":"i tried this restaurant last week after hearing good things about it! i got the shawerma platter for 12.99! at first i thought it was a little pricey, but after i seen the portion, it was worth it! rice was tasty, chicken was good! i like how they give you the salad in a separate container! also comes with pita bread! i would recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"I drive coach bus and was in town with a group to the Monticassino place hotel. I try to go and get shawarma whenever I can because we don't have any good shawarma in my home city. This place was just down the road and am glad I went. Huge portions, really good, fresh food and the owner and hostess were some of the nicest around. This place is also the cheapest price I've seen in Toronto for shawarma. If I'm ever back in this part of town again, this'll be my first choice for dinner."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. Their shawarma, schnitzel, falafels, skewers, and etc are amazing. I have tried almost everything on their menu and was not even disappointed once. It is all homemade food and prepared by hand. They are really nice people too, making you feel very welcome. Also the place is very pretty. Great atmosphere. I would go out of my way to eat there. I highly suggest going there for lunch or dinner, or even both."}
{"text":"This place has the smartest restaurant set up of all time.  Definitely just a regular ol' schwarma place. But in order to eat there, they make you sit down first, thus creating a false atmosphere of \"dining in\" (and having to tip), when really, they still just make the foods, put them on trays, and you sit down (they called us up to pick our toppings...really she just came over and said hi to us, and thus it warrants a \"sit down\" restaurant feel).  The food was good though, although the pita was stuffed with all the toppings on the bottom, and then chicken on top, so you end up just eating chicken, and then all the toppings afterwards.  I'd go back if I was in the neighbourhood, which is really never, but if someone asked me for a good place to eat around the middle of nowhere, I'd suggest this place."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing. I had the shwarma plate. Comes with salad. Choice between mashed potatoes, fries or rice. Had the rice it was delicious. The chicken was very tasty and juicy. Portion size are huge, so much food. Hot sauce was good too and they also serve pickles, peppers and pita bread."}
{"text":"Had the shawarma plate ($12.99). The meal came with salad, pita, pickles and pickled peppers. The meat was thickly sliced, which differs from the typical thinly slices of chicken from other sharwma joints. There was a choice between rice and potatoes. I got the rice and it was amazing. Would come back when I am craving for sharwmas again"}
{"text":"love the food here! friend was raving about this place so we took the first opportunity to go there and visited this place. it's a bit of a long way out to get there but the food is totally worth it! As my friend said it's the best falafal in town and it is! crusty outside and soft and moist inside. ppppperfect! and oh um the baba ganoush is aaaaaaaaamazing! and the portions are huge and the prices are cheap for the portions.  we had soooo much food... I think it was official overdose. I couldn't eat for the rest of the day...  so good."}
{"text":"The restaurant was empty when we got there. Order the lamb chops and salmon shish kebab. Didn't like the food at all. We got the salmon to go with rice and the rice tasted burnt. The lamb chops came with mashed potatoes, we didn't like it either. The salmon was ok but the lamb was disappointing. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Great overall dining experience!! Had the chicken pita and ohh yea it was delicious.  Great flavours and my biggest judge of a good pita, it wasn't dry and made fresh. I was visiting from out of the city and will be back with friends to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food , great service. Fresh, delicious and affordable every time. North york's best kept secret!"}
{"text":"I really really liked the sandwich I ordered here - it was the Pita Kefta with all the toppings including a really yummy hummus and well marinated coleslaw. The meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly and the additional hot sauce I asked for was no joke - it gave a really good amount of heat and taste without being overbearing. So I don't live in North York and the chances I'll get to eat here again are slim to none, but if you have the chance to grab a bite here, take it! I wish I could pack this place up in my luggage and take it back to San Diego with me so I can taste more good stuff!"}
{"text":"Phoned them with short notice to cater a work event for 15 people and they were very helpful. Good feedback from all people on the food quality and freshness. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"It pains me to give a negative review to what is clearly a small, family-owned eatery, but if the food's bad, it's bad.  I wasn't especially hungry, so I opted to just share a plate of hummus with a friend, because it's impossible to go wrong with hummus (or so I thought). We were delivered a plate of complementary pickles and hot peppers, and this seemed to be a good, promising start to the meal.  And then the hummus arrived. I think I can safely say this was the worst hummus I've ever eaten. The presentation was fine but the taste... I think they had blended chickpeas and tahini and that was the extent of their preparation. It was essentially completely tasteless. It didn't have that garlicky, lemony bite that one expects out of a decent hummus. It had also been sprinkled with what looked like a spicy seasoning, but it too was devoid of taste.  I should note also that my friend had ordered the Pita with Lamb and a couple of pieces of the lamb were essentially inedible (i.e. they were rife with gristle and tough fat).  It's a shame because the service was quick and efficient."}
{"text":"This little spot, tucked away in a nondescript strip mall across from Downsview airport, is a real find.  We all had shish-kebab dinners.  The steak ones featured excellent quality meat and the chicken one was also superlative.  All came with huge salads of mixed greens, carrots and tomatoes, nice warm and thick pita, and really excellent lentil rice.  Unfortunately they were actually out of shawarma, as they seem to do a big lunch business and had a run on it.  Prices are very fair given quality and portion size.  In addition to the pita, you also get pickles and peperoncini for the table.  Friendly, homey service.   PS:  The next strip mall has a Service Ontario branch that is not too crowded - if you need to go to Service Ontario you could do well by stopping here for a meal."}
{"text":"I sort of want to give this place 3-1/2 stars, but oh well.   This weird little nook, way down on Sheppard, is barely noticeable if you drive by. I've gotten their take out a few times and also eaten in once.   I've had their chicken shwarma and falafel pitas and sampled some other dishes. Generally, I find the portions quite large and the food quite good, but it's a bit of a crap shoot with the chicken shwarma. I've had it a couple of times where it has been very good and another time I thought the meat was chewy, fatty and full of gristle. It's being cut off of a big hunk on a spit, so I guess you get whatever comes off at that time.   The service has always been great and very pleasant."}
{"text":"We ran into this place trying to grab something to eat. Have to say the place from outside is not as fancy as some of the downtown restaurants, but the falafel in pits is delicious, fresh, fast and cheap. What can I say? If next time we went to that area again, definitely gonna visit the place."}
{"text":"Visiting this Restaurant on my lunch break sometimes. this is One of the best shawarma place around. They serve freshly-assembled toasted pita bread wrapped around chicken that has been slow roasted all day, alongside diced tart tomatoes and crisp cucumber, and slathered with tahini, hummus, or garlic sauce. Each mouthful gives you savory burst of flavor that will keep you wanting more until you will have gobbled up the entire thing before you know it. Always tasty and fresh. Good selection of salads/side dishes. Price is about $8 for sandwich."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience . I came at 12:20 pm and was served with Shawarma pita . The meat was dry and cold . Feels like it was cut a while ago and was sitting on a tray. When I complained that the meat is cold , nothing was done to solve the issue, I was offered to purchase another meal.   Unhappy with food and service.   Hope you will have better experience."}
{"text":"Had some delicious falafel in a pita today for lunch. Price was $7.99 including side salad or fries. I tried the greek salad, which came with the usual veggies for a north-american style presentation (green/red pepper, tomato, cucumber, iceberg) and a nice greek dressing with pre-crumbled feta. The falafel was excellent, fresh cooked to order with tasty chili sauce, tahini, and vegetables in a warm pita pocket. The server was friendly and the cook asked me how everything was when I was done...I responded positively. I'll be going back soon to try the namesake shawarma."}
{"text":"Walked in and was pleasantly surprised to be greeted so warmly by the owner and the hostess. We were promptly seated after they asked if we wanted to dine in. After we looked at the menu and placed our orders, within a minute we were served whole wheat pitas with a generous portion of salad. The meat was succulent and cooked to perfection, the mashed potatoes were buttery and soft, the pita warm and fresh, the rice with lentils was simply the best I've had in ages. Overall you will feel the passion that this owner has put into his place, food, service and quality to be the best you have experienced from the time you walk in until you leave. Was not expecting much when I looked at it from the outside and the location but this place is f*in amazing hands down!!!!"}
{"text":"I dont usually give 5 star because i think usually either service or the food is not equally good. But hands down for this little restaurant for both service and food. Ive been craving for pita for a week and did some research on places nearby my work. This restaurant popped up and google reviews were not too appealing for their services. Anyhow, i went in and gave it a try. Not only i was greeted immediately by manager or owner while hes having lunch, the 2 cashiers were very friendly and offered suggestion. I got my lunch in seconds, i went back to office and i could not stop after the first bite. I immediately want to try everything on their menu, and i am 100% sure i will return.  This place is a must go."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in to try the humus with foule and egg as well as two entrees - the filet mignon shish kebab and the chicken breast on a skewer.  Our comments are as follows: a) The décor is nicer than, say, Meron; b) It was quiet for a Saturday night; c) The humus was melt in your mouth and delicious with lots of foule (fava beans) and olive oil; d) The pita was fresh and warm; e) We ordered rice and salad with both entrees and the rice was tasty despite not being basmati but had tasty lentils in it; f) The chicken was tasty and moist;  g) Best of all, the medium rare filet mignon was GREAT. We'll be back with our kids.  Thanks, Baba Ganoush."}
