{"text":"Their foods are great and the proportion is larger despite the relatively moderate to cheap price. The service is ok. Tht said, they dun accept credit card tho, which is not convenient. Btw their black tea is quite ok indeed"}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times now, most often for Hong Kong style breakfast on Sunday mornings.  Interior decor is a mixed bag of gaudy and bland, with specials listed on posterboard, assorted red and gold ornaments hanging here and there, and aquariums full of live seafood visible in the dining area.  Service is typically fast and no nonsense; order-by-number is the name of the game here.  The wait staff is rather robotic, so don't expect any small talk.  Tables are set by dumping an handful of chopsticks, a stack of plates, and some tea on the middle of the table.  There are multiple menus with a dizzying array of options but I generally stick to the breakfast specials for $5-6.  Food is served quickly and is generally fresh and tasty although I have noticed a distinct downsizing of portions recently, likely in an effort to avoid raising prices.  All in all, it's a no-frills kind of place serving simple food quickly and inexpensively - good for a quick fill but not for a first date."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese restaurant. Lunch specials are reasonable and come out quickly. Dim sum selection is good but can be a bit greasy. BBQ pork and roast duck isn't bad. 
Not a lot of Chinese restaurants on the north end of Markham which is why I eat here more often than I normally would if there were other options."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ Pork and BBQ Crispy Pork with rice. 

Very large portion and delicious. 

Not the cheapest but tastes good.

There is a wide selection of food at this restaurant. A long time neighbourhood Hong Kong style restaurant in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Good food but AWFUL service. My mom raved about this place's food but as soon as we sat down, our server brought over four green teas and waved with his hand for me to move my purse. The table was huge and he just HAD to put the tea down where my purse was. My mom ordered the food for our table and the server forgot to bring over one of our main dishes. Since nobody checked on us or even acknowledged us because we were the only non-asian people in the restaurant, we couldn't ask about it until we waved over one of the managers. The staff were all hanging out and talking, obviously too busy to be actually doing their job. The food was good and cheap. But the servers would not even look at our table or at us when they passed by to do table checks. Our server especially was so rude, and we had to ask a different server for our bill since he never checked up on us. We finally saw our server again when he brought over the check, and said thank you, still not even making eye contact with us. The bill was 44.60, and usually as a server myself, I tip 20%. He did not deserve more than 10%. My mom put down a 50$ bill, and was fishing in her purse for change. I told my mom that was more than enough tip for bad service, meanwhile another server who was cleaning up our table gave me a dirty look for saying that. Sorry but you do not get rewarded for poor service."}
{"text":"It's a restaurant with a huge (6 or 7 page) menu, and a BBQ and a bakery section. It's pretty inexpensive but the dining hall is not going to win any cleanliness contest. The food is OK and it is crowded almost all the time due to people in nearby offices coming in for lunch and even for take-outs after work. The restaurant is open till 3:00 in the morning so if you're in the neighborhood after midnight looking for food (although I don't know why you'd be since there's almost no nightlife in this part of Richmond Hill) then this restaurant can be a good destination for inexpensive, passable food with big portions. The bakery is always offering discounts like 3 loafs of bread for a dollar (hint: they are not freshly baked) but I guess it's better than throwing them in a dumpster. All in all an inexpensive eatery, nothing fancy with OK tasting Chinese food."}
{"text":"It used to be OK and I used to dine in often. But recent visits really disappointed me. The chicken was dry and deep fried squid was over burned. I would be cautious to go again  unless someone would pay for my meal."}
{"text":"LOVE their chicken wings, fish siu mai, and ice lemon tea!!

Chicken wings ($4.50 for 5): Their chicken wings are so crispy and the saltiness is just right.

Fish siu mai ($2.80 for 5): The fish siu mai, OH MY~~~~ so yummy!! They have the best fish siu mai in town!
they have 2 kinds of siu mai, one is the dim sum style (pork inside), one is the street food style (fish inside), TRY the street food fish siu mai! SOOO GOOD! I look around and always see 3, 4 other tables ordering it. The fish siu mai is so big and there's a lot of fish meat inside the siu mai, so soft, and taste sooo good with the sweet soy sauce that they put on the dish. (I uploaded the pictures of fish siu mai) MUST TRY!

Ice lemon tea ($2.75): LOVE the ice lemon tea! Their ice lemon tea taste better than the other places!!

{"text":"I enjoy their combo of dishes from the wok. Good quality, fast deliverable and family friendly setting. I like the pork chop with thousand island sauce and fried squid here."}
{"text":"If you are looking for chinese fast food this is the place for you. There are LOTS of selections and very cheap. It is a very big restaurant however for Saturday or Sunday lunch you might have to wait. 
My favourites: richmond court fried rice, black egg congee, intestine dish, HK tea.
The food is nothing to write home about and the service bad. Service is done quickly like they do not have the time of day for you, no time for any questions. The food is 3* and service is 2*. Do not expect gourmet cooking and certainly not a place for business discussions and quiet dinner. Tea is usually served in glass, glass looking very used. Why do people go back to this restaurant you ask? Convenient location, fast, adequate food, good portion and overall cheap. Wanted to give them 2.5*, didn't want to give 2* and deter people away. Make sure you do not go with high expectations, food is okay other than that everything fails. Ok, lady at the cash register is quite nice, and everyone else looks grumpy and zombie like."}
{"text":"Been going here for maybe five or six years now.

It isn't amazing food, but when you're hungry and need a fill up, this is it. It's also open very late.

The food is served in Chinese \"family style\". When you order a plate of chicken fried rice, it's meant for everyone at your table. Myself, I just take it as a single meal!

I've had several other dishes here over the years, all of which I'd definitely recommend trying. I often order the shredded beef over crispy noodles with black bean sauce whenever I'm looking for a noodle fix (I'm a rice kind of guy). It's always delicious.

Fried dumplings are good and size and very appetizing, as are the sandwiches.

Don't expect their bubble tea to be anything special. If anything, it may be a little sub-par, but that isn't what you're here for anyway.

The owner, Mark, is always around and very helpful. He works as hard as his entire staff.

I'll be going here for years to come, and I've always introduced new friends in the area to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to get a BBQ pork and steam chicken on rice. It was weird, chef took chicken out if clear plastic bag (like the ones at grocery store), which is odd for a restaurant that serves Chinese BBQ. Chicken tasted foul and awful, wasted my money. I hope I don't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"Avoid this place if you can. Their food isn't good and their service is really bad. I ordered noodles with roasted pork. The noodles didn't taste like anything and the pork was salty and cold. They also forgot some of our orders and when they arrived, they were also cold and bland as well. The servers were also rude. They spill your food all over the table and place your dish as far away from you as possible. You'd be better off spending your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"1 word sums up the food at this Richmond Court location. Bland.

Go to the highway 7 location instead. After eating at the Bur Oak one, I'm not surprised why it's like a ghost town at 8pm while the highway 7 location is always full. 

Service was good though. Probably because there were only 2 tables of customers including mine."}
{"text":"Beef brisket noodle soup: 
Price: $5.99

- Beef brisket were super tender, sufficent amount
- noodles are the thin chinese egg noodles, which were cooked just right. Not overly done
-Broth was not too salty

The bowl overall was 4/5.


 Baked seafood on fried rice:
Price: $10.00

Seafood contained squid,shrimp,scallop and fish, which were all lightly battered, and were not over cooked, especially the squid.
The cream was OK not too salty or overwhelming
Fried rice was seasoned perfectly

The rice overall was 3.5/5.

HK milk tea hot:
Price: $1.99

Nice and silky...does not come with sugar, so you can adjust it to your liking

Tea was 5/5

Service is what you would expect at any  chinese resturant.
Nothing special but gets the job done
3.5/5 

Definetly a must try late night resturant!
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Taste of the food is good but we found they added too much MSG.
Very convenient located in the neighbourhood with lots of parking spots. Price is in average as we can find better deals at other restaurants with the same quality of food in the area."}
{"text":"Friggen terrible.  Didn't have the steamed rice I wanted at prime lunch time and messed up my drink order as well.  It must be hard to pay attention when the store is empty."}
{"text":"I must say this is the worst restaurant I have ever met in Canada. As a Chinese, I felt shamed with the cuisine here. How can they provided the dishes in such a horrible way! If there was zero option, I definitely would choose that."}
{"text":"Prices are greater for either breakfasts or lunch food or even afternoon tea if your around in the area. The food if decent nothing that makes you wanting to go again other than the price for a decent meal. Another reason why this place is pretty good is that it's open til 3 in the morning so it's good for those who are hungry at the middle of the night."}
{"text":"No matter for breakfast, lunch, dinner or a late night snack. This is the place I've come to at least once a month for around 8 years. Breakfast is always on point forgot which combo letter it was but i always get the omelette, sandwich and satay beef noodles substituted with instant noodles, delicious!  I like coming here at night a lot when i'm craving dimsum, their siu mai is pretty decent. Lots of different variety on their menu and inexpensive prices with a decent sized portion that can fill up to two people!"}
{"text":"The food here has become absolutely horrible in recent years.  Food presentation and serving size are passable, but taste-wise, the food is horrible.  Moreover, the food here doesn't seem to taste very fresh.  Yes, it's very affordable in price here, but so are lots of other restaurants and cafés, but with way better quality."}
{"text":"This place has a floor detergent mixed with greasy wall stink when you walk in, and I guess that's why the staff leave the front door wide open even when it's -5 outside.  The ladies behind the counter are gossipy, and you hear them rant about customers all the time. 

I've tried their coffee once, and that was also the last time I'd buy coffee from them, ever.  It was abnormally bitter, acidic, and close to being the worst.  That poor pot of coffee must have been sitting on the burner for hours.  

Their buns are alright - quite large with a good amount of filling, and really cheap.  Although I'm guessing they're wrapped in plastic because some have being stored overnight. 

As for the dim sum bamboo baskets lurking in the back, I'd say skip them. Once I got some microwaved shu mai and beef patty rice from their dim sum cart, and there was a hair threaded through one of the shu mai's.   Yew."}
{"text":"Food is horrible. The green onion pancakes have no green onions and are extremely dry. Service is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Dad brought us here for breakfast today, feeling nostalgic with this location in Times Square. Apparently, it was quite famous way back when I was younger.

The bakery located right at the entrance distracted me for a while - I love looking (salivating) at buns and cakes.

My brother ordered a tuna sandwich, toasted. He enjoyed it (even the small bits of vegetables in the tuna mixture)!
The server messed up our order of milk oats with toast and gave us thick toast instead. However, we decided to just stick with the thick toast since my brother wanted it. The toast came with jam (something like orange marmalade) and sweetened condensed milk. My favourite part: dipping the deep-fried custard buns in the condensed milk = HEAVEN.
Lastly, we also had fried turnip cake with beansprouts. Although the turnip cake was rather addicting (I'm a sucker for turnip cake), the dish was really oily!

Anyway, I left the place full and content (though my condensed milk craving just multiplied)."}
{"text":"Menu is pretty standard.  We like the beef with black bean sauce and crunchy noodles, spicy squid and several rice dishes.  Friendly service, and easy takeout. 
Bakery isn't great. 
Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"a classic Cantonese food place for all suburbanites (actually I would consider it an institution at this point). the name has been around forever and I've been going since its original Hwy 7 and Chalmers location. 

Food quality is ok - if you're going to rate it against the legit Canto food places, I would say the food here lacks flavour (actual flavour, not sodium flavour). However, it is open late all the time, and I would rather pay $10 with a group of friends to eat some decent food vs shelling out $20 at some chain resto down the street for mediocre food. 

Garlic veggies, pan fried turnip, and the baked spaghetti are my favourites here"}
{"text":"Great for a quick cheap meal.  This location seems to have larger portions than the location at Bur Oak, probably to maintain competitiveness with so much selection so close to it.   Ordered the duck noodles, fried beef noodles and a side dish and it came out to $20 with leftovers!  Unheard of.  Service is curt and fast.  This is in the style of the street market food in HK and China so it is definately consistent with that style.  I would ask them to thin out the sauce in the crispy noodles.   All else is fine.  Cleansiness is acceptable.  Go for a quick cheap meal.  Lots of selection of noodles, congee, one dish meals."}
{"text":"You get what you pay. Poor waiter service. A cheap quick-and-go eatery. Last choice to pick in nearby area."}
{"text":"If you only have 20 minute lunch break, this is the place to go. Typical hong Kong cafe food and price."}
{"text":"According to what are displayed on the wall and electronic billboard, I ordered the clam and thousand years egg congee, another soft shell crab fried rice.  The clam adds a fresh seafood taste to the congee which entice the appetite.  I usually have the soft shell crab alone and not mixed with anything.  But the fried rice tastes very good.  Though after a while the soft shell crab is not crispy anymore.  So next time has to eat fast.

Although both cost a bit more than the normal dishes, it worth to try."}
{"text":"Loud, busy and offering about 300 Chinese dishes and even sushi what more can you ask for. The food is not the best of the best but still very good and the prices are ridiculously cheap and the service is prompt. Dim Sum is decent but I really love the beef brisket noodle soup and their barbecued pork and roasted duck. Open 24 hours too so a great place for after the club. My go to for Chinese in Richmond Hill. Last time I was there 4 of us ate like kings and left with multiple doggy bags all for $70."}
{"text":"Breakfast portion is really small compare to other Hong Kong style restaurants at similar price range. 

Food is either tasteless or too greasy."}
{"text":"This is a good place that has a lot on their menu. It's a nice default place as food is good, prices are fair and it is fairly easy to get seats. 
This is not a place to go to impress a date, but a nice place to go when looking for something cheap to eat. 
The dough fritter rice noodle rolls are pretty good here!"}
{"text":"ok, the restaurant is a typical Hong Kong style, with lots of varieties in the menu. We ordered a bowl of rice noodles and one bowl of dumpling, so far so good.
The service is oK, compare with the one in TIme square, seems like this one is more friendly. 
They have wifi,  and a TV to watch while eating."}
{"text":"Food:
Decent for Chinese diner. Don't expect healthy options. Portion size is good for the price.

Service:
I have been here on a dozen occasions, usually late night, and the service has never been good. Meets expectations for this type of establishment. 

Decor:
Dated decor, questionable cleanliness.

What I return:
Yes"}
{"text":"I was craving for cuttlefish ball noodles for a couple weeks and was itching to buy a food processor just for making my own.  Then my mother reminded me to go to ?? for a bowl and buy some extras home to saturate my cravings and save my money and effort from buying another machine for my limited kitchen space.  So today I went, after reading other fellow yelper's review.

I have a bowl of cuttlefish ball noodles.  Decent.  Another bowl of Chinese dumplings.  Reasonable and better than the cuttlefish balls.  I saw others order the beef tendon noodles and looks good, and mentally make that as my next week's list.

Service is quite good.  The place is pretty clean.

I planned to buy some BBQ when I leave originally, and then I saw the Chinese mochi!  And then I saw they just finished making more mango mochi!!!  And then I saw the staff cannot stop herself from \"tasting\" them.  So I bought that together with other dessert.  

OK for mochi dessert that I've got, 5 stars!  The cashier was nice enough to remind me to keep the mango mochi in the fridge (sorry it didn't make it to the fridge, I finished them in 10 minutes...).

I will be back, for my mochi (and other food).

Oh yea price is reasonable.  Done in is $20 for the 2 bowls including tips.  Dessert is $15.10.  The value of the dessert supersede the noodles... stay tune for the beef tendon next time :)

--------------
The red bean coconut cake (?????? when sour.  I will stay away from it"}
{"text":"A long-time local restaurant that always has seats if you need a quick bite. Served a large selection ranging from stir fries, seafood, bakery items, noodle soup, congee and HK style cafe drinks.

Dishes:
BBQ pork - regular
big portions and quite tender. Not too fatty. Typical BBQ stuff, served cold

Stir Fry Rice Noodles with Beef in Black Bean sauce
Was a disappointment. There is less than a handful of black beans in the dish and the rice noodles is bland and tasteless. The noodles were also kinda hard, like they stir fried straight from the bag. There are 3 coloured peppers but overall the dish lacks flavour. Had to add soy sauce and chili oil to spice it up.

I've had better dishes from here. The grouper with cream corn sauce on rice and the beef brisket noodle soups are usually good. Their egg tarts are the best, esp when they come out fresh around 3pm.

I'd say their HK style fushion dishes are better than their stir fries. It's a hit or miss at this place."}
{"text":"I have to admit the buns are tasty. Except that I found hair in the stuffing of their bun...twice!! And also a metal strip apparently from their dish washing brush in one of the dinner course..which is probably the reason why my dad got stomachache that night"}
{"text":"I think this is a childhood favourite! When I was younger I much preferred the location further up at highway 7 and Chalmers. For this remaining location I come maybe once a month since I have an errand that takes me to that area. They still serve the same stuff and the portions are gigantic. There is dim sum available during lunch hours. They also have a bakery and barbecue area. 

There is a lot of variety with the menu. They offer typical Cantonese/Hong Kong style food at an economical price. They serve my favourite ice cream red bean drink and they do it the best here! Tables are turned over fast. Through my experiences, I think their service is much better compared to when I was younger but I think it depends on the servers moods (kind of a typical Asian restaurant service experience)."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious and open late. The service I've gotten here is always pleasant, if a little slow, but super nice. The food is the perfect amount of greasy for late night munchies and especially good for big groups because the orders are plentiful."}
{"text":"This place should be made into a parking lot. I'm sorry but the food is just a write off here. Let me start with my main concern first. We found a 3 inch wire inside our food! WTF! When we told the waitress about it she just laughed and said nothing. Okay? What about sorry or I'll take that dish off the bill. This place is f'en sad and depressing. I'd seriously eat off my washroom floor before coming back here. Oh and the kitchen staff don't wash there hands after going to the washroom. Good luck if you decide to come here."}
{"text":"The decor is nothing like the other places we've eaten at in Toronto. It looks and feels much lower grade. The dish I had was good though. I ordered half roast pork and half roast duck over rice. Only problem with the food is the hoisin sauce was gooey. It wouldn't even stick to the meat! I just ended up not using it. Oh, the hot tea in regular water cups wasn't attractive. No one drank it. There's just something dirty/not right about drinking hot tea from a small water plastic cup. My kids wanted water and I didn't even ask for it. Something about this place made me think twice about having them drink anything here. 

One positive fire sure is that you can buy Totoro toys for $2 in the hall way."}
{"text":"So... last night I finally summed up the courage to give this place a try. I don't know what it is about this place that makes me so skeptical to eat here. Other than the fact that it's open late night, it's your typical Cantonese style cuisine, located behind the big sign of Times Square. 

I would say this place is great if you're looking for a late night snack or after a night of drinking, however, I wouldn't necessarily come here otherwise. Plenty of other places you could choose from during the day. In my opinion, this place is sort of more like somewhere to quickly fill up your stomach. The ambience could use some improvements, and the service requires more friendly staff members. 

The food is pretty mediocre, but big in portion size (hence why it's awesome to come here after drinking or whatnot because you get super hungry - and the 3 stars). I got the Yeung Chow fried rice which was decent, but lacked a little with regards to the rice being a little too soft. I'm no fried rice expert, but usually the rice is a more on the chewy side."}
{"text":"Definitely A-OK! I've passed by Richmond Court all my life and always wondered what was here. Since my parents moved nearby, I decided to go for their breakfast. 
They've got dimsum and a breakfast menu set. I tried:
Chicken steak and egg with a side of buttered bread - the dish was a bit under seasoned but a dash of salt and white pepper did the trick
Deep fried squid tentacles - I'm not entirely sure how I felt about this one. I always order it whenever it's on the menu but the Richmond Court one has a bit of sweetness to it. It's a little unusual but not bad.

I wanted to get some dimsum but I saw the dimsum take away counter and it was cheaper... gonna hafta get that next time I visit my parents. Oh yeah... they're open late too so I gotta try their regular menu."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for almost 20 years...always find their food pretty good. Today we ordered a BBQ rice dish and asked them for the green onion ginger sauce..the boss then tells us now we have to pay for it! $0.50 isn't a lot of money but this is just BS!!! First time I heard of a Chinese place charging you this"}
{"text":"This place has been around for decades. The food is pretty average so I'll make this review short. 

We ordered the pork chop casserole with tomato sauce and the curry braised beef and tendon. The curry beef came out in a flash, around 5 minutes. The flavour was typical of  hk style curry and doesn't warrant any accolades. At 14.99 a pop though, the price is steep and isn't reflective of the quality. 

The pork chop with tomato sauce was better. But it took substantially longer for it to come out, almost 20 minutes.  The fried rice underneath the pork chop had the perfect al dente consistency , and wasn't soggy from the sauce. The porkchop also had a nice crisp to it.

The service is surprisingly very good , the waiters always seem to be on the lookout to refill tea and always managed to refill our glasses before it was empty. Pretty speedy and attentive. 

Overall, this place is fine for a quick bite to eat for hk favourites but food quality isn't top notch. For the price, you can find better elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is the ultimate last resort location for food.
They are always open and always seem busy.
They also make all kinds of food, from bakery to sushi, to BBQ.
However though they do everything, they are not particularly good at anything. You would only come here if there were no other options. Usually late night meals. The food may not always be at its best here; but I am more than happy that they have been around for such a long time, satisfying my many late night cravings through my tennage years"}
{"text":"Richmond court restaurant does it all. A bakery located at the entrance butts up to the barbeque pork, duck and cha siu hanging in the glowing red light of the warmer. Drinks are made behind the counter and live lobster are kept in the aquarium under the television. 

The menu consist of the typical Cantonese style cuisine of a variety of fried rice, noodles and congee. However my favorite of them all are the baked chicken casserole on rice with tomato sauce or a cream sauce. The chicken they use is typically fried to give it a nice and crispy texture so it doesn't become soggy when the sauce is on top. This place has a huge selection of dishes like no other and the service is noticeably volume driven. I give this place a 3.5 star because a jack of all trades is a master of none."}
{"text":"Place is not that fancy. If your looking for laid back place and something quick then this place is good to go to. We went there during the week so we didn't see the cart rolling around. Ok place."}
{"text":"Pretty much a legend in Richmond hill. I remember coming here with my family and family friends almost twenty years ago. They used to be super busy but these days, not so much... Since Congee Queen, there's never any line ups here. Rightfully so, Congee Queen is significantly better on all levels. 
A nice alternative though if congee queen is too busy, you can come eat here. There's never a line up here. 
Their ho fan, rice noodles with beef and vegetables is my favourite. Always has been, probably always will be. 

They don't accept credit card so bring cash or debit card."}
{"text":"Sentimental..... That's how I feel about this restaurant. Growing up in Richmond Hill I frequented Richmond court because the asian grub was hella bang-on and mad cheap. I remember going there as a kid slamming that fluorescent hot and sour soup and eating deep fried salty squid until my belly hurt. I remember going there as a teen, ordering the whole menu and smoking butt after butt in that closed off glass smoking area. I remember going there last month and re-living all my childhood experiences. 

I won't lie, the quality of food there has gone down a bit over the years, but it is still one of the top places to secure Chinese food in the Richmond Hill/Markham area. When I'm fiending hot & sour, that Cantonese noodle crunch, or that ideal texture perfect jelly rice noodle, RC always delivers for me. If you are a bun/pastry lover they have a whole section of it by the mall entrance, I've only ever tried the pineapple buns which are sweet, solid, and stellar. 

Let it be known I do not vouch for this restaurant as a Dim Sum venue, I've had it a few times and it can not hold a candle to other fine restaurants in Markham. Another point to note is people often confuse this location with another at 328 Highway 7 E. As far as I know, this location I am reviewing is the classic spot. But see for yourself. 

Ideal Order

Hot & Sour Soup
Cantonese Noodles
Richmond Court Fried Rice
Deep Fried Salty Squid
Rice Noodles w/ Black Been Beef
Beef w/ Ginger & Green Onions
Assorted Sweet Buns
Hong Kong Style Milk Tea

I work at Woodbine and 7...guess where I'm going for lunch today."}
{"text":"This place is great if you're in a pinch and need something quick and hot to eat.  The decor and staff are nothing special and typical of most Chinese restaurants.  The staff are not the most friendly and are relatively attentive at times.  You'll have to really wave them down if you want to order or would like more tea.

I usually order a beef brisket noodle bowl, wonton noodle bowl or various dim sum snacks.  The food is always made to order and served hot and fresh.  I always make sure to order a hong kong style milk tea as well to keep me up at night.

Overall a great place for a late night snack when nothing else is open or around.  The best part about this place is it is mega cheap.  Last time I was here with two other people the entire bill was less than $25!"}
{"text":"Not gourmet, no fancy decor, and some dishes are just ok, but it's cheap, fast, open and busy 'til at least 2am, and some of their dishes are very, very good.
My go-to's are the \"Gon Chow Ngau Ho\" or beef soya sauce ho fan noodles, which have an authentic flavourful 'wok-hei' taste, their yummy ham sui gok which they call 'savoury triangles' dim sum (lol - since they are deep fried rice pastry filled with ground pork in a sweet-ish sauce, and shaped like footballs, not triangles). They also do great deep fried squid tentacles, amazing lemon chicken, excellent milk tea, as well as the house red tea, plus simple but yummy sandwiches, and the mango pancake is not to be missed :)"}
{"text":"2.5*
Had a craving for some criiiiispy noooodles, was in the area (*gasp!* so far north?!) so popped in here for some Chow Mein. 
The service was very non-chalant. Actually, the waiter started walking away before we were even done speaking a few times. I think i was lucky i was with a Cantonese speaking friend, or we might have been ignored completely! 
As usual, they brought over the delicious tea right away. We then got a HK style Milk Tea (yum!!), dumpling with noodles in soup and Cantonese Chow Mein. The dumpling noodle soup was really good. I also really liked the Chow Mein! I like to sprinkle the chili oil on mine for a little heat.
Atmosphere left something to be desired, and the service could definitely be improved. But the food was good."}
{"text":"I'm biased with this because my family and I have been eating here almost every Sunday since I was 5. This is our OG go-to restaurant whenever we can't choose what's for lunch. The staff here is also very nice. We get to skip lines sometimes hehe. Seriously though when it comes to menu items, they have a large extensive and inexpensive menu with Chinese BBQ, seafood, dim sum, noodles and rice/spaghetti dishes. I tried almost everything on the menu ngl. My regular order lai fun noodles with beef tendon (6.99), with a side of pineapple buns with butter (2.29) or egg and ham sandwich (4.79). I've tried almost every topping you get with your noodles, it's all so good! Overall will probably be coming here every sunday of my life."}
{"text":"This place is great if you are straving at 1:30 am and McDonald's is not an option. The food is insanely cheap and served ridiculously fast. The meal in the picture cost $35 and was served within 15 mins of ordering. However, the food wasn't the tastiest and we did find a hair in one of the dishes. Lastly, only dine here if you have someone who speaks Chinese, otherwise it would be difficult for someone who is not acquainted with the menu to order."}
{"text":"Love this place!
How can you go wrong when you are greeted with four separate and distinct menus? Something for everyone!
Especially enjoy the dim sum, bbq pork and what we consider plates.
Portions and plates are served family style, service is good, attentive and quick.
Very fair prices! 
If it's not on the menu, I suggest asking"}
{"text":"Food was uninspired, tasteless, and felt like it had been sitting around for ages. After ordering what you think it would be difficult to mess up - General Tso's, beef with chili sauce, and bubble tea - we finished none of them. The roast duck, ordered as an afterthought, was equally bad. 

It's there, it's cheap, it didn't smell that much like garbage, and we felt full afterwards - beyond that, nothing going for it."}
{"text":"We had soft shell crab with rice, was delicious despite have a strong taste of butter. Deep fried tentacles were bland, beef ho fun was good and lastly we ordered beef ribs on a sizzling hot plate.. took awhile for beef ribs to come out but they were delicious. Decor is very dated and pricing was decent. Washroom is a hassle because its in the basement and down 2 flights of stairs but at least they were clean and there is 3 stalls!"}
{"text":"Alright. Richmond Court Restaurant is a good option if you're looking for authentic Hong Kong style dishes.  The restaurant itself is inside a Chinese Plaza, but has plenty of seating. There is also a bakery affixed to the restaurant, so you can get some bread or pastries on your way out.

The service was decent and we were seated quickly, even during the height of lunch time (11:30-12:30pm). The restaurant can get pretty loud, and the decor is a little démodé, but the food itself was good. 

I had braised duck noodle and a Hong Kong style milk tea. Their braised duck is fresh and really delicious; their portions have gotten a little smaller over the years, but it's enough to fill you up. Because their milk tea is so popular, it is always fresh and never oversteeped. They serve it without sugar, so you are free to add as much or little as you would like.

The prices are not the cheapest, but are acceptable considering its quality and their service. 

I would definitely recommend Richmond Court Restaurant if you're in the area and looking for a decent Chinese meal."}
{"text":"Before heading up to Toronto, I was reading reviews from Yelp! and found this restaurant.  After seeing that this was a 4 Stars, I decided to go there for breakfast during my trip.  When we arrived, the staff(s) were unfriendly, the service was slow, the food was oily/greasy, wasn't the cleanest place, the drinks came much later than the food (when we were almost done) and the staffs were arguing among themselves on pricing of the food on the menu.  When we asked for the check, we paid in cash + 10% tips.  We counted the money 3x, and left it on our table.  As we were walking out, the cashier came chasing after us because she said we were short $8 ($3 for food; $5 for tips).  She was unfriendly with an attitude!  Everyone who went with me had diarrhea.  I do NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone (unless you're asking for an intestinal disorder characterized by abnormal frequency and fluidity of fecal evacuations).

The only reason why I have to give a 1 STAR is because it is a required field before I can post."}
{"text":"Speedy service, owner is very nice and she always give me suggestion what to order. Best HK style Cantonese restaurant in Markham but not the cheapest . Always had pleasant experience 
Price has gone up but speed is what they win my heart and food quality is acceptable to hkers taste"}
{"text":"Not the greatest to eat at. Food isn't so great, and the prices aren't exactly cheap. There are plenty of other places in the area that offer a similar menu, though I will admit that Richmond Court offers a lot of various dishes. I don't think I'll come back here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for cantonese noodle and other comfort food. Best in town stir-fried rice noodle with beef and satay sauce
Other signature dishes are beef tendon / brisket."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for at least a decade. But nothing seems to have changed.  

At first I was craving their beef brisket ho fan, which is how we ended up there. But then I got distracted by one of the tables eating lobster e-fu noodles.....so that's what we ordered.  Also got beef rib on sizzling plate. 

The lobster e-fu was alright. Lobster was a pretty decent size with a satisfactory amount of meat.  The beef rib sizzling plate was sweet?! 
The menu (in Chinese called it black pepper beef ribs). I would have expected it to more salty/ spicy than sweet. 

All in all, the lobster made up for the beef rib fail.  Although, after the meal I still wished I had stuck with my original craving for the beef brisket ho fan. 
Next time...."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken fried rice and the general tao chicken, the waitress didn't speak english, they didn't accept visa or debit card. They brought me cold green tea while I waited for the food. The chicken fried rice was ok at best, and they give you alot for $6.50, but I've had much better. The general tao was nothing more than boneless chicken wings, I brought it home, I couldn't eat it, it was absolutely disgusting. When the waitress brought over the bill, it was $17.52, they look at they money like hawks, like they're suspicious of you, unbelievable. I used to come here all the time 15 years ago, now, it feels like your entering foreign territory and they don't want to have anything to do with you."}
{"text":"My first time here.  I figured i would try this place because nothing else is open.    Waitresses and waiters seem to just chill and play with their hair.  Chopsticks are dirty. Bowls are just stacked together in front of me and they didn't distribute it amongst my group. So far very unimpressed. Service is so bad. I'm sitting next to a door with duct tape on it. Venue not very nice either.

My first dish is beef and chili sauce.  Id give it a 3/5.
Second is e-fu and mushrooms. It's much better than first.

I had to go up to counter to pay bill. Not sure if that's the norm there.

Overall score is 2 for me."}
{"text":"***1/2 stars

Richmond Court Restaurant is located inside Times Square in Richmond Hill on the ground floor.  When you enter the restaurant you will find a bakery and also barbecued meats section which leads into the restaurant.

It is quite spacious and there are flat screen televisions showing whatever is on Fairchild Television.  

The service here is quite slow and they are for the most part understaffed.  A family friend of mine really loves curried crab, but unfortunately does not get a chance to enjoy this dish often so I brought him to Richmond Court to try their fantastic curried crab.

Now - everyone has their preferences in terms of how they like their curry.  Some like it hot, some like it creamy, some like it mild.  The curried crab at Richmond Court is a mildly spiced, creamy and sweet type of curry that is perfect for dipping.  We ordered \"Little Pork Buns\" with our order.  The bread resembles Challah and was served piping hot.  I will add though, that their curry is quite oily.  We had so much sauce left over that I ended up getting it to go (why waste such a yummy sauce?) and the next day when I took it out of the fridge, all the oil had floated to the top and I filtered that like porno on a family-shared computer!  It was quite tasty tossed with soba noodles...

The market price was $23 for the dish, and we were served a complimentary soup which was a broth-y Duck & Winter Melon Soup."}
{"text":"Been coming here more often after church on Sundays. Their breakfast specials end at 11 and that's about the time church ends, so it's perfect! When I come, it's usually full. It's safe to assume that this place has decent food. I wouldn't say their food is bad, but it's not great. I definitely have had better, but this place does it if I have a craving for good HK milk tea and a butter pineapple bun.. NOM NOM! Service is decent and nice, sometimes quite hard to flag them though. Overall a good experience, with the exception of... you guessed it right, FLIES during the summer time. Lately I haven't seen much, so either they stepped up with cleanliness or this summer has been oddly cool for flies to breed.
Anyway, I recommend this place.. that's if you have never tried Mings Noodle Cafe hehe :)"}
{"text":"Don't expect good service or exceptional food when you come here. This place is very big and run down, their menu is huge and serves everything from dim sum, HK breakfast/cafe style food to baked goods.

I came here for breakfast and got one of the combos. The food was OK, messily put together, pretty carelessly (but hey what do you expect?) The servers don't say anything and slam plates onto the edge of your table and walk off. They talk amongst themselves and gossip while standing around lol. 

Its okay for a quick meal but only if you are OK with the careless food and service."}
{"text":"This is not the Richmond Court of the past. The quality of the cooking has waned. My simple test of a plain bowl of noodles in soup says a lot. The noodles are no longer crunchy. I suspect the supplier changed and the chef over cooked it - twice (I gave them a second chance in one sitting)! 

The other dishes we ordered were uninspiring. The vegetable was not that fresh, but I'll give it a pass as the cooked dish was a borderline pass. Need some \"wok hay\" though.  

Lastly, cleanliness isn't their strong suit. Bowls made it to our table with rice from the previous guest; however, the rice has been cleaned by the dishwasher. Don't pay attention to the decor as it's been the same since the day they opened (such as the carpet, and I'll go out on a limb on this one, the dishwasher). In other words, I would treat any green pass or yellow card suspicious. Go at your own risk, but I did survive last night, but would probably be a couple of years before I return. Hopefully they don't get red carded."}
{"text":"Came here today with my sister after church, unholy is how I felt walking out. Ordered the Russian boursh, pork and cheese bolognaise baked spaghetti, and the fried dough wrapped with rice roll. We were served with a nice hot bun with some butter at first. But everything just went downhill from there. The cheese was a Kraft singles slice, and it seemed like old grounded up cha sew instead of ground pork. Served with a nice portion of ketchup instead of tomato sauce, I would've settled for canned tomato sauce over whatever that was. Boursh was mediocre but it's okay, and the rice roll... Well the fried dough was very crunchy, don't know what to say. Currently writing this review while trying not to borderline vomit my bed, just don't come here anymore, the place is no longer the same."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I actually like this place but compared to the Chinese restaurants around the area, it's sub par.  It's a great place for a late night snack as it is open very late and the food is passable.  Anything baked or fried is good.

This is the Chinese version of a greasy spoon diner."}
{"text":"I'd give Richmond Court zero stars if I had the option. Ordered chicken breast in tomato sauce with rice. Inedible, chicken tasted like a plastic silicone implant, sauce was so sweet you'd think they poured a cup of sugar into my container with soggy rice. By far one of the most disgusting meals I've had. Big lover of Chinese food and I've seen far better than this."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I ate there twice lately and the food has gone bad. It's disgusting. Will never go back again although I live two minutes from it. Terrible! Terrible! Terrible!"}
{"text":"Come here for late night Chinese food. It's one of the better ones and almost always packed. Don't come for high quality Chinese, but it's probably better than some of their other grimey ones around here."}
{"text":"* Their ice milk black tea is the best.  Not too strong, exactly the way I like it.  
* Bakery is good.  There is a wide selection of bread and pastries in their bakery.  Bakery is good.  
* Food: I used to love their roast duck noodles, but recently the quality is going downhill.  There is too much fat in the duck skin.
I recommend: SIngapore noodles, curry beef on rice, dim sum, and everything else, except the meat from their roast meat counter.  The duck is fat, and the barbeque pork is chewy and fat.
* Portion: huge! 1 dish of fried rice or noodle can be shared among 2-3 people.
* Service: you shouldn't expect the service to be good in a Hong Kong style restaurant, so I can't say I am disappointed.
* Cleanliness: as long as you don't look under the table, then it is fine.  One time I asked the waitress to sweep the crumbs and the bones and she refused.

My conclusion: Despite the bad service, I have been going to Richmond Court for 18 years!  
The food (most of it) and the price is good."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant for so many years. I say 31/2 star because the service is quick and food is pretty good. The only thing I don't like is when you order noodles with BBQ meat they separate the noodle and the meat. The portion of meat is so much you can't really finish it. The charge is more also. I can't imagine how woman can finish it either."}
{"text":"Sometimes I think that I can be blinded by Nostalgia and Memories that never seem to go away.  I'm probably not the only one as most HK people always claim that the Milk Tea in HK is much better quality.  I'm probably one of them as I always think that the Thick-walled Tea Cups in HK only exist there and the ones here are either less thick or doesn't have the same characteristic.  

I was quite satisfied by both the quality of the Milk Tea here and the Made-in-China overused Thick-walled Tea Cups here at Richmond Court. I've always enjoyed their Milk Tea or even Coffee/Tea combination and I still continue to do so(+0.5 Star).

I was less than happy when my Condensed Milk/Peanut Butter on Baguette Bun finally arrived when everyone finished their choice of Drink and the XO Sauce Radish Cake.  Overall its an essential HK style Cafe that comes with that authentic style of speed, service(...), and selection although I would be hesitant to order any Japanese Sushi there.

Side Note: I noticed that most of the women working there had some pretty hip-happening hairstyles.  Maybe they get sponsors from a neighbour hairstylish.  Check-it-out!"}
{"text":"Nice little local HK style food.  It's good for a quick and easy meal. It's not fancy, fine dining, or place to come looking for.  It's a great stop, if you are in the area and need a quick fix of Chinese."}
{"text":"I've dined here for many years and it never disappoints as a quick go to spot for Chinese food and dim sum. It's been a year or two since I've been back but today, it was just as good. 

The only two things I would warn you about, though, is the amount of salt they have in their food and their creepy downstairs bathroom; other than that, service was good and food was food. 

Dont come here if you're looking for a fancy night out. Quick dine in though, good to go; I ordered food for dinner of two (that would've fed 4-5) and the bill was only $50. Not bad."}
{"text":"This place is like a chinese style food court more than a restaurant. The interior of this place is old and dingy. There are many choices on their menu, but I have to say the food quality is just okay. There are other places uptown with same style of food and same price range that are better."}
{"text":"Good food with mediocre service. Service you'd expect when you walk into a typical Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is a staple for late night foods. Big dishes, decent quality, decent priced Chinese food. I like their duck and noodles. Not the best service or cleanest restaurant ever, it's a no frills kind of place. Overall recommend"}
{"text":"Summary: late night hang out spot is definition of varied comfort food from Hong Kong.

Top Must Get: The 'dual bbq rice' 
Top Regret: Red braised beef noodle soup
(It's not red.)

Take you back to the 1990s Hong Kong. The grubby look, the dozens and dozens of options on the menu, the very loud service staff, the old school feel... 

The food is what it is - filling, served quickly, fairly priced, and decent tasting. It's not winning awards, but they accommodate large groups, they open late, and they got variety. 

I almost want to give it 4 stars for nostalgia-inducing-environment... but 3 is where it's at."}
{"text":"Richmond court has two locations in close promixity to one another. There is one in the Time square plaza which I'd bigger and there's an actual restaurant. Then there is this one which is a little further west along hwy 7.  This one is much smaller, and is mostly a Chinese bakery withva small selection of Dim sum items and a hand full of table.

My review is for the latter. I really enjoy eating Chinese buns. The pineapple buns are my fav and if you're lucky enough to get them while they are fresh from the oven then it's just heavenly.  The only dim sum item I've tried is the vegetarian mock meat dish. Other than the pineapple buns they make pretty good garlic buns, which rivals any restaurant. They use a sweet buns dough combined with the salty garlicy spread. There's nothing else like it.  

The prices are pretty reasonable. If you buy six or more buns, you don't have to pay tax."}
{"text":"I didn't get to try the dim sum, but the entrees (crispy wontons, pan fried crispy noodles and fried rice) we ordered were not bad.  There were only a smidge of grease and no headaches from MSG.  I doubt this place serves anything that has MSG, which is makes it even better.  And of course as traditional Chinese restaurants, it was family style so we had leftovers even with our party of 5."}
{"text":"Order their House baked rice, big potion with a pork chop, and assorted meat,  very good value.  WE also order the double Fried ChiuChau shimp balls and crab meat cube....I think this dish is one of the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"Who said there is no good places open late at night in the suburbs???    My go to place whenever I have a craving for good food late at night....late meaning midnight.   They are also open during the breakfast and daytime as well but I rarely go then since there are other choices and frankly don't want to always eat there.   I go many times late at night due to sports but don't want to be boozing it up afterwards at bars.  Here you get a great selection of Chinese food in an environment that is quite busy even at midnight (I seen people line up late-not a long line but waiting to get in).  

If you are searching for decent food in Richmond Hill (especially late at night-I think they are open til like 2am or so), they is the place!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Great location, speedy service, huge menu selection, affordable and amazing hours until 2:00am-2:30am. I usually call them to see when their last call is.

My friends and I found ourselves these past few weeks after hanging out late on the weekends past midnight to see where we should go, and we always end up back here.

If you're looking for late night food satisfaction, this place never disappoints."}
{"text":"I've been at this restaurant with friends, family, and coworkers. This review is not for their barbecue, noodles, or rice dishes. All which I've tried before and deserves 3 stars at most. I've also tried most baked goods in their bakery, including their fresh fruit cake. All of the above is passible and deserves 3 stars, but their mango cream pancake is deserving this 5 start.  

It's a very thin pancake filled with fresh ripe mango and whipped cream. It's not overly sweet,  like most Chinese desserts with creams normally are. All together it worked really well. 

I originally wanted to buy the durian pancakes for father's day but they already sold out.  So definitely head there earlier in the day if you want to pick one up.  I'll be back to try it out."}
{"text":"It's famous here, it's been here forever.  I only go here when everything else around is closed.  So i guess there isn't really much of a choice.   The food here is alrite.  Everything seems kind of blan to me.   They could add a bit more flavor to all their food.   The soup noodles especially seems like it's all made by the same soup base which is really faint and they just throw whatever in you ordered.  Other dishes have a lot of oil in them.  And the drinks have huge chunks of ice cubes in there so really you only have less than half a cup of liquids.   Again, i only come here at night when everything else is closed but if i had a choice i wouldn't come here."}
{"text":"I ordered French toast for afternoon tea and it was done very poorly. The toast was soggy because it soaked up so much oil. I couldn't even bite into it because my mouth would be full of oil. The service is always terrible there so don't expect any type of it.
The only thing I liked was their HK milk tea."}
{"text":"Blah! Inefficient customer service and the quality of food resulted me with a private date with the Porcelain King for fifteen minutes.  After enduring a one hour and four minute flight with the unruling Delta Airlines from New York's JFK to Toronto Pearson International Airport, my family and I crave for Chinese comfort food as we were immensely famished. We ordered noodle soup which the braised beef noodle soup was salty, spicy and poor quality in meat. The meat lack substance.  Bubble Tea is priced at CAN $3.75 but no choice of mango.

There were no waiter in sight to hail for our bill to be tallied, plus our waiter disappeared to oblivion along with a small lump sum gratuity. I had to personally walk to the cashier to get our change as the wait staff was completely unavailable to be disturb from their precious time. 

N.B. Richmond Court only accepts cash and debit cards, NO other form of credit cards (American Express; Visa; Master Card; Discover; or JBC) are accepted."}
{"text":"Food is generally bland compared to others like congee queen. Food is not bad. It's just not as good as the others I've tried."}
{"text":"This rating is for the Hong Kong Style Tea only and service. The restaurant was super packed when we went. We only wanted Hong Kong Style Cold Tea and they make the best here. We got about 15 of them and they were so fast. Very Impressed. Can't speak for the food but i can assume it was good it was a packed full house.Oh right and its Cash only. They said Debit too but guess what the machine is not working. So be sure to have CASH when coming here."}
{"text":"Best beef noodle soup ever. The brisket is so tender and the portion is huge. I tend to stick to the same menu items but they offer a huge selection on their menu."}
{"text":"I overall love this place. Love their late hours and selection of food. You can be craving anything Chinese and know that you can come here and satisfy it. I particularly like their dimsum at night, and it's not even that pricy. I mean their decor can be more updated, but it's still clean. Other dishes such as their congee, beef noodle soup and fried rice noodles are all also good. Staff is nice and prompt."}
{"text":"They don't make pizza.  Surprised?  When you sit down in this simple but large restaurant, you are handed no less than 5 menus.  They serve everything from noodles, to congee to sushi--Oh My! (ode to John Pinette).  They make everything except pizza!  So, \"how is it\" you ask?

Considering this restaurant has no clue about picking a culinary theme, they do an awesome job and juggling so much variety.  You would think that they can't do it all well if they do everything, but I say \"Nay Nay!\"

They have great, gargantuan noodle dishes, enough for two meals.  They have standard dishes, and a list of sushi, dim sum and of course-BBQ Hong Kong style!  This is the place if you or your group can't choose between sushi and Chinese, and spaghetti.

The key for me is the BBQ.  When I had my company offices located a block away, I ate at Richmond Court at least once a week for a decade, but now I have to plan a stop with other errands.  They always have the BBQ treat hanging in the glass cabinet at the entrance, but on certain days...

Today was that day:  The crispy skin Roast Pork had just come in.  Succulent and tender, crisp and salty, it is worth it to be there on the correct day of the week (it changes).  A 2 or 3 combination of meats on a bed of rice for about $10.  I can never finish the rice.

The service during the lunch hour is fast.  They churn through the patrons as fast as the kitchen can serve up the goods.  And good it is!

On the way out, you can pick up some of the Chinese baked goods at the front of the store.  I recommend the Coconut Cream Buns!  But they don't make pizza--yet..."}
{"text":"My second time being there, first time was maybe 8 years ago. To me it doesn't look clean, portion of food is big, tastes okay. Their lemon iced tea tastes good. I don't know if I would visit anytime soon, because it's nothing special to be honest, not a fan. Many other Hong Kong style cafe has better food and atomsphere"}
{"text":"This place is great for late night eats, and when we're craving a quick, easy canto dish. My husband always gets the BBQ pork/roast pork on rice and the portion is pretty generous. I stick to wonton noodles.

I would steer clear of their dim sum menu, even tho it's so cheap. Quality/taste are not very good."}
{"text":"I've been to this place for breakfast a few times with my family, and it was pretty good. I feel like the restaurant itself could definitely use an upgrade though because the silverware, plates, tables, chairs, etc. all seem pretty old. Also, I find their choice of media to play on TV to be pretty questionable at times.. I mean, does anyone actually like watching aerobic workout videos while they're eating?

Moving on. I really liked their HK style French toast. It was thick, and the outside had a really nice crispy texture. The flavor of the French toast in combination with the syrup and butter was seriously addicting.. I always found myself wishing there was more after I was finished with it. The rice noodle rolls were pretty standard.. I think they would definitely be better if they were softer. The pineapple bun with butter was about what I expected, so I didn't have any complaints about that. The \"omelette\" (basically just egg with ham) was a little strange to me. There was some sort of yellow-ish liquid inside of the omelette that I found to be pretty odd. The satay beef with vermicelli was a very simple bowl of noodle soup, but I actually liked the flavors way more than I thought I would. The beef was soft, and the flavor of the satay beef mixed surprisingly well with the vermicelli and soup. We also ordered a large vegetarian platter (not positive this is what it's called) to go. It was really good, but I honestly wasn't a huge fan of the curry variation.

The service was straightforward and to the point, but they do seem to be a little understaffed most of the time (waitresses speed walking everywhere). The prices were more than reasonable. Overall, this restaurant seems like a good place to go for a quick, simple, and cheap meal. The food is very worth it for the price, but there are definitely better restaurants out there in this area. I would still gladly come here again. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"One of my favorite place to eat in Toronto. 

This is where we usually stop for afternoon tea or lunch.  I think it's either inside or around \"Times Square\" on Highway 7.  

My favorite is the toasted \"pineapple bun\" with butter...and HK style milk tea.

I also like all the noodles and congee."}
{"text":"This is seriously authentic Chinese food. Not that Americanized stuff! Very large seating area, plenty of free parking, and open late even during the week. Had the 3 BBQ combination and loved it!"}
{"text":"I've frequented the bakery part of Richmond Court for years now, having never visited the restaurant this review is just for the bakery portion (obviously).

The cakes are made in the typical Chinese method, in that they use light whipping cream and not the rich sugar cream, like the friends at Ruelo or Chocolada. It makes a great change from the norm every now and then. The pre-made cakes come in a variety of flavours like Mango Mousse, Fruit, Chocolate Mousse, and Black Forest. 

The also have an assortment of pastries like egg tarts, really sweet rice cakes, custard buns, red bean cake, black bean, etc. Their turnover is pretty frequent so you don't need to worry about the softness of the bread. 

There is nothing innovative about their line and in terms of presentation, it's a bit lacking; I've been to much better Chinese Bakeries, but Richmond Court is a pretty stable supplier if you live in the area or happen to be passing by. The hours are great and there is rarely a lineup."}
{"text":"Truth be told...I've been dropping in here about 3 times a week for the last 2 to 3 weeks on my way to work, getting here closer to 8, is better than getting here closer to 9.  The parking situation gets messy.
I seem to have taken a liking to the fried noodles.  At $2.25 for a full box, it's a nice snack/lunch option.  I also get a BBQ pork bun for $1.20.  I'm happy with the prices, and I have the BBQ bun as breakfast on the way to work.  Stopping here is probably about the only good thing about choosing to take hwy 7 to work."}
{"text":"I've concluded that I'm pretty Asian... as in - love asian food, having constant asian cravings, like my hole-in-the-walls, set meals, and paying a super cheap price!
But there are so many types of asian foods and cuisines that I can never get it all in one place............ UNTIL NOW.
It was my birthday.... and i wanted to make sure I ate somewhere that had everything I wanted.... which included:
1. Baked Pork Chop rice
2. dim Sum
3. Red Bean Ice.

Seriously... where can i find that? Not getting 1 & 3 at a dim sum restaurant..... maybe 3 @ a bubble tea place, and 1 would be at a traditionall chinese diner.... and then my mom suggests Richmond court!

First of all - I always go to the one at times square... their pork chop rice is THE BOMB.... it's the only one I go to when I'm at home. There's something about their meat - the way it's cooked, the spices, the sauce.. I don't know but it's addictive... she suggests the Bur Oak location and tells me that they have 1, 2, and 3 at the SAME PLACE! SOLD!!!!!!!!!!

I walked in at noon, scared that it was going to be packed on a saturday, but luckily there were still a few tables available. There was even a large flat screen tv with the world cup playing.

I ordered all the goods - the baked pork chop was everything a more. Large pieces of soft, and chewy meat on a bed of tomatoey rice. Steamed dim sum came out and the shrimp dumpling were large and chewy. I have to admit that the rice noodles were overly thick and too tough, but I didn't care.

The red bean ice was creamy and soooooo satisfying. everyone was crazy full and the bill came to about $8 / person - Cha-ching :)

Perfect Birthday Meal! yum yum yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"I posted the picture of a steamed bean curd roll that i had for dinner. While I was eating it I thought that they left a shrimp tail in it, so I spit it out and it was a plastic wrapper that said 71-90. I'm so pissed off right now and disgusted!
How do you miss something like this while preparing food?"}
{"text":"Average Cantonese food with average service . Like many Chinese restaurants in the Toronto area its cash or debit only, this holds true for this place as well and they plaster the sign in front of the cash register to make sure you see it .

We ordered wonton soup, fried chicken cutlet with curry over spaghetti, a dish of roast pork and duck and salted cod with chicken fried rice .

Overall the food was OK nothing spectacular, but if I had to choose my least favorite dish that night it would be the roast pork since it was very dry.  Conversly, my favorite would be the fried rice . 

Service was a little below par but we came late and I guess everyone was tired. Maybe it's just me but the waitresses all seem to be out of it and in their own little world. If you want delicious Cantonese style food this is not the place. Average Yes, great No."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot! Lots to choose from! 

My favourite dish is the seafood rice noodles with XO sauce! 

But the friendly staff are pretty good at helping make the best recommendations for you!"}
{"text":"Quick, convenient service with an extensive menu to choose from. I'm always a bit apprehensive about places with a list for a menu because that usually means the quality of dishes goes down. In this case, it sorta does.

It's a quick bite for Chinese food. Portions are okay and I stick to fried noodles or sandwiches. 

Not that clean of a space from my experience. Really they need some upgrades to their furnishing but also new kitchen equipment. Even their tea pot was all stained with sauces And you just start to wonder what else is on there... 

Prices have seemingly gone up a bit, but such is life in this day and economy. I think it's about the same as any where else serving this type of food."}
{"text":"Terrible service, borderline food

Waited forever for seating at an empty time, had to wait and then ask for a menu, and basically wait for everything meanwhile the waiters just loitered and talked. Food portions were large but bland in flavour and proportions, as most of the plate is rice and sauce. Waiters were also extremely rude, they basically try to avoid you and then when they serve you, they serve you in the rudest possible way that they could get away with.

Service is terrible but if you're nearby and need some emergency food especially at night when they're still open, not bad. Otherwise, don't drive to get this."}
{"text":"So I have it a try yesterday and order the same stuff as the one in Richmond hill. My son order the ham egg and cheese sandwich. It definitely not as attractive as the other location. The fish ball and wonton noodle soup has less taste. The service was quick. I think I would come again if it's late at night otherwise there is lot of better restaurant around."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place around Markham for a late night bite. Staff isn't the most attentive or english speaking but they get the job done as long as you dont ask to many questions. I wonder why I'm always the only white guy around!?"}
{"text":"Good food and good portions. Not too small portions and not too much MSG their food. My favourite is their soup such as chicken corn soup and wonton noodle soup. There's always seats and not too crowded :)"}
{"text":"We ordered several party trays from here on Saturday. I did a little bit of research first and for the price, this was the best option. Their dishes ranged from around $25-$40, depending on the dish, which I think is the way to go. Congee Queen had every dish at the same price of $34.99 regardless of what you were ordering, so say a platter of deep fried squid was the same price as a platter of bok choy.. not sure how they came up with that one.

We ordered Chicken Wings, Deep Fried Squid, Deep Fried Pork Chops, Fried Rice and Shanghai Noodles. All for a decent price, and large portions. 

The noodles were a tad soggy, but tasted good. 

It's a good option if you need to order large quantities for a party, for a good price."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Richmond Court. I've always thought the food was pretty good but there are so many places to choose from these days and more conveniently located closer to home or work. This visit was for a late dinner with a couple of friends who also happen to be colleagues.

The menu is quite extensive, with something to please everyone. We finally settled on Steamed chicken with ginger and green onion, green beans with minced pork, and soft shelled crab fried rice, all fairly simple dishes.

The food arrived fairly quickly and my companions allowed me a moment to take pictures of each dish before digging in. They know the drill.

As expected, the food tasted good, with the fried rice being my favourite of the three dishes. It had more crab than I expected. Good! The green beans and pork, seasoned with preserved black beans, had a lot of flavour and was also very good. The chicken, on its own, was subtle but was very good with the ginger and green onion sauce. I love that sauce.

Overall, the food was as good as expected. The presentation and service could have been better. Bowls and plates were chipped and very worn. I didn't come here for 5-star service or decor so I guess my expectations were met. Good food."}
{"text":"Richmond Court Restaurant gets an extra star for nostalgic value alone. This restaurant is a old-time staple for the area and delivers all the typical Hong Kong cafe food items. You can get the set meals with milk tea, fried rice and noodles, dinner dishes to share or pick up a Cantonese bakery items in the front area. 

I prefer to come here during 'tea time' to grab a set meal, usually a pineapple bun with a pork chop and a milk tea under $10. The service is nice but brisk and mainly speaks chinese. Thankfully all the menu items have translations so you can navigate with little issue. They open early and close late, so feel free to drop by anytime you are having a craving for comforting Chinese food."}
{"text":"The restaurant didn't change a lot over two decades, even their staff...  Huge menu selection, cuz they keep adding new items into their menu.  We used to come here for breakfast, afternoon tea, or even late night snack.  Full of good memories here...

But now, we came here whenever we need a quick meal...  as their food quality is getting worse... especially in the past couple years.

I used to love their beef brisket rice noodle in soup (???).  But after my recent visit, I guess they are out from my restaurant list.  Beef brisket has no taste at all...  I felt like I only having rice noodle and soup... I am very disappointed...

My husband ordered black pepper beef on rice, and he said the beef tastes funny...  Not like what we can have in other Hong Kong style restaurants...

So now, I can't think of any reason to come here anymore."}
{"text":"This place is incredibly mediocre. The decor is bizarre and the food is just ok. We ordered dim sum, general Taco's chicken, fried turnip patties and Chinese broccoli and nothing was memorable or noteworthy. There are definitely better options before midnight but if it's late and you're hungry (like we were) that's the only reason why you should consider this place. If you're looking during the day, stay away."}
{"text":"They were one of the top and authentic Chinese food restaurant 10 yrs ago. Since then, food quality has gone down, service is crap while prices have gone extremely high. One of their store also closed down due to lack of customers. 

HK style milk tea is no longer genuine, the portion for soup noodles is crazy small. The once famous pineapple bun with butter is a total joke, bun is lukewarm with thinly sliced butter. 

p.s. DON'T try the pad thai, it's put together with ketchup sauce, little shrimp and chicken while noodles are overcooked!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today. The food was ok and the price is acceptable too but I found the food mediocre. The onion pancakes way too greasy and falls apart, the shrimp dumplings were extremely sticky and overcooked, and the squid was greasy and not crispy enough. 

The service wasn't that great either. We had to try and flag down a waitress for a good 5 minutes. When we made eye contact with a few people, they ignored us. When we finally ordered, the food took a lot longer to arrive than expected.  The waitress gave us our food, gave us our tea and then never came back. Even when we wanted to pay, we had to try hard to flag someone for our bill. 

This is one of those restaurants that is very forgettable."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Nice selection of food and is open late till at least 2:30 am every day!  Food here is pretty good.  They have the usual Cantonese food and snacks including bubble tea.  I've tried the noodle soup, rice dishes, dim sum, sushi, bakery, bbq pork, all are pretty tasty.  

We were here today on a weekday at 1 am and the restaurant was still pretty busy which makes it great if you are concerned about safety eating out late at night.   Service is ok, great location and it's just so convenient to come by for late night dinner/snack when everywhere else is closed."}
{"text":"Think Lobster cooked well and served on bed of yummy noodles. 
Did I mention the way the dish is served looks as if the Lobster is swimming in the noodles? In a brothy sauce that's mild in flavor but delicious?
Did I mention I am not a fan of seafood? Did I mention I usually can't stand calamari, but when they deep fried the little squid cupper suckers of our little squid friends, that they were al dente, flavorful, and yummy?
Seriously, I have had Chinese food in SF Chinatown, Oakland Chinatown, Los Angeles, in Dublin, Ireland, and yes, even in Laramie, Wyoming. But I must tell you, that this is the best Chinese food I have ever had. Hong Kong style that is authentic to the hilt.  Dim Sum is available for dinner!
With the cold biting at you outside, it was so nice to sit down, have a cup of tea and pig out on some wonderful food with  wonderful friends. 
Richmond Hill, a suburb of Toronto, is a little shining gem of Canada. I only wish I had more time to hang out and try all the authentic places of Singapore cuisine and more. However, coming here was a great treat on my first trip to Canada. 
Cash only."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving this place under 3-stars...I mean, they try hard at least, and it's literally the only Asian restaurant open after midnight in all of York Region!

I normally only have two things in here: Braised Beef Noodle Soup, and their 5-piece siu mai (NOT the dim sum one) if I'm hungry. The noodle soup isn't bad, though a little on the oily side. I do like their siu mai though, but I'm rarely able to finish all five pieces in one go.

Their iced tea is terrible though. Service isn't much better.

It's weird though...this restaurant offers EVERYTHING. BBQ, bakery, Chinese-styled western food, sushi, dim sum...I'll give them effort for that, but as the saying goes, if you try and please everyone, you'd end up pleasing no one."}
{"text":"Richmond Court Restaurant is simply one of those places you go to because you know it's open. It's not 24 hours, but who in York Region would still be out past midnight? If you really are, the Richmond Hill branch opens till 2:45am everyday. :)

The Markham branch is quite tucked into the parking lot, especially considering the entrance on Bur Oak if you're driving. The restaurant itself is unsurprisingly smaller than the one in Richmond Hill, and quieter as well. Menus are pretty much all the same though, give or take some chef specials.

I had the beef brisket noodle soup, which is usually what I order in the Richmond Hill branch as well. It tasted okay, the one here was much more bland than Richmond Hill, but I did feel the one in Richmond Hill to be too oily in the first place. Of course it's not authentic, but it does get a little tiring to go to Pa Pa Chang or Mei Nung all the time for authentic Taiwanese noodles.

Service is typical HK style cafe type of laissez-faire DIY kind. Don't expect good treatment here.

Richmond Court's Markham branch is a good option for those in the north or east end of the city. There's a lot more options as you head south or west though."}
{"text":"It used to be a better, but Richmond Court is a decent HK-style restaurant that's in this part of Markham. Noodles and fried dishes are pretty decent.

My fav is the baked pork chop rice, I don't think any other place has anything that's comparable.

The dim sum take out in the morning is a great deal, usually decent, but the only annoying thing is they often sell out of the good stuff quickly and they don't make more to sell."}
{"text":"Great good and cheap prices
What more can you ask for

Love going to the take out dim sum section next door for their chicken mushroom rice and hk style milk tea"}
{"text":"Richmond court is your typical no frills Chinese Diner: OK quality, good value.

Pros:
Lots of items to choose from
Good value

Cons:
Food is average at best

Let's get this out of the way first.  If you want a nice fancy dinner, you're obviously not going here.  Having said that, if you want an enjoyable meal with good portions for what you're paying, this place is a good bet.

I've been here for lunch and dinner in the last little while.  When you come in, you notice this place is a lot bigger than it seems when looking at it from outside.  There are tons of tables here and it's very rare that you will have to wait long for a seat when you come. As soon as we sit down, we're presented with 4 different menus.  Richmond Court offers plenty of variety to choose from.  They have their own bakery, a Chinese BBQ shop, all day dim sum as well as your standard regular Chinese restaurant fare.  That's pretty convenient if you come with a party all with different tastes.

When I came for lunch, I ordered from the Chinese BBQ portion of the place.  My GF got the won ton noodles and we ordered a dim sum dish for our little one.  Having all this choice already came in handy.  Not many places can fill this type of order in the city.  I had the roast pork and soya chicken combination.  It comes on a very big place with a lot of each type of meat.  It could of used some veggies but for the price, it was good.  The same can be said of the other dishes we had.  Again, the theme of this place is good value.

For our dinner time visit, we ordered from the set dinners that are main stays at Chinese restaurant.  You pay a set price for a certain amount dishes.  The dishes you can choose from are all on a list.  We ordered a beef dish, a bok choi dish and half a soya chicken.  Going along with the theme of this place, great value, OK tasting.  Set meals come with soup but you will need to buy bowls of rice.

All in all, you're getting what you pay for here.  If you come here looking for a decent meal with good value, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy the food at this restaurant and maybe it was the time we came here but I did not enjoy 2 out of the 4 dishes we got. We got the pineapple bun with butter which was okay. Then we had beef intestines noodles which usually had a great aroma when it hit the table and it didn't this time around. We also ordered the baked rice with ox tongue in tomato sauce and it wasn't amazing. Lastly we ordered a baked rice with fish in cream sauce it was delicious. My mom and I had a theory that we came in at the wrong time when the head chef was eating his dinner so that the noodle and ox tongue rice wasn't good. Then when we noticed that the staff was done their dinner and we ordered the baked rice with fish, it tasted amazing again. So avoid the 5-6pm hours (if you believe in our little theory)!"}
{"text":"One of my go-to's for late night Chinese food. Classic Chinese menu with everything you want from general Tao chicken, dim sum and broccoli beef. While not the best dinner ever, it definitely hits the spot. I recommend the chili beef"}
{"text":"This place was a real treat. Tasty and reasonably priced Chinese food. If you are looking for chicken balls or lemon chicken this place is not for you.

Probably best to order a variety of dishes to share dim sum style. When we were there we had the bean curd spring rolls which were great. It tastes a little fresher than a regular deep fried spring roll. We had some fish cakes and fish dumplings. Both good. The stuffed eggplant which had a yummy sauce with it. As well we had the fried turnip cake which surprisingly had meat and shrimp in it. So if you are vegetarian be aware of that.

After lunch we picked up a few things from he bakery for later as we were full enough from lunch.
Would totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"I would say little less then 3 stars but definitely worth more then 2 stars.

Been a long time sporadic customer. I think the quantity and quantity has dropped throughout the years.

Great late night place if you're looking for Chinese food court type food plus a little more - huge menu selection!!

Today, I ordered a Baked Portuguese Chicken Rice, the portion did get smaller over the years. The sauce was ok, not too much butter which I admire. Boneless Chicken was slightly fried (or heavily stir fried), tender, and nicely portioned for a meat eater.

Would have wanted to see some potatoes and onions in the mix and maybe some coconut sprinkles to garnish. Take-out was actually finished baked in the oven - the way it's supposed to.

Take-out total was $10.15. Most places will include a drink for that price.. so in this case maybe $1 more expense then others, but nobody else open at this time."}
{"text":"I went back for breakfast one day. Good extensive breakfast menu.
I had a sandwich with some kind of meat in it. Not only was the meat delectible, the bread that it was served on was made fresh of sweet bun dough. Incredible stuff."}
{"text":"We were in the plaza to pick up some cool sexy clothes from fahion compass and dropped in again. It is good because they have everything you can think of on the menu and it is cheap
Years pass and they still don't have the parsley dumplings. It is \"sold out.\" In English we say \"it is not available\" because when you always say \"it is sold out\" it means you had it earlier.
Anyway hot and sour was good, dumplings were good, they got the noodles wrong and so on."}
{"text":"Great late night stop, portions are a good size if you want to share with others. Take out is always quick, staff friendly many have been there for yearrsssss.
Not the cleanliest place."}
{"text":"This is not a restaurant grade cooking, I ordered a curry beef brisket with rice, OMG, I never see such a bad presentation dish ever.....the beef brisket taste like sitting in fridge for years, the curry sauce looks like dark yellow jello without any curry taste. The rice was not even hot(just warm). The server was not polite. This is the first time I have been to this location and for sure will be my last time. I keep this comments short because I don't even want to spend my time to talk about it anymore.....Yelp please add -5* options for us to choose"}
{"text":"Although I couldn't savour Richmond Court's array of in-house treats, I had the opportunity to taste their Mango Mousse cake, which, I must add was the ultimate desert option and immediate salvation to thine soul. I must've experienced divinity everytime I took a bite. The 5-star rating is, as a result, exclusively for their cake. A wise man once said, \" to predict the quality of a crate of apples, just sample one.\" I am sure this would apply in this case as well."}
{"text":"We've gone here, on and off, for most of the 10+ years we've lived in Markham.  As of last week, we saw a sign that this location was now closed and that they have moved to Times Square.   Wish they would have given notice..."}
{"text":"Quick breakfast, no line and fast services.  They have a great cup of milk tea.  The fish fillet congee, shrimp wonton, fry dough and fry dough with rice noodles are also good.  The crispy port are good but it not warm, the skin were crispy with no bones."}
{"text":"This is the to go place for anyone, any group of people at anytime of the day. They serve everything you can find in a typical chinese restaurant with dim sum and chinese bbq as well. They also serve a wide variety of chinesr style drinks including some that you might not find anywhere else (e.g. milk with egg).

Quality wise they hold a strong, solid and steady quality. They have been around for as I know which proves this is a legit restaurant and is still doing very well after all these years. What makes this place good is its cheap price. It is always a bit cheaper than other restaurants around here. Moreover, this place opens till LATE. it usually opens till 2:30 past midnight and it's perfecr for people that wants some quick food late at night when everything else is closed."}
{"text":"I seriously don't know how they're still opened till this day. This place is so unsanitary and I wouldn't find anything particularly special about the food other then their all day dimsum. Food is overpriced and customer service is terrible. I dropped my chopsticks and asked for another pair. The server only payed attention to me after I asked the second time. It's not a place I recommend anyone or my friends to go to."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my benchmarks in Richmond Hill for well-priced and abundant Chinese fare, but in the last few months the quality of the food seems to be dropping and things have become a little average. The char siu was one of my favorite dishes because it was flavourful, crispy and well-executed, but has become too fatty, slightly undercooked and resembles boiled meat. The quality of the dim sum also has taken a turn for the worse. I've tried most of the items on the menu and it's quite a shame, I've been coming here for years but now look for some new options as far as a Hong Kong-style take-out in the area."}
{"text":"Back in rhill this is THE spot for late night food. Well it was... a few years back when nothing would be open at 1am... 
this was one of your few options if you were hungry at 2am. 
Richmond court is basic hk food and dimsum that is mediocre but comforting all at the same time. Eating here at midnight makes my tummy feel good.. but if i was here for lunch i wouldn't be so impressed. 
This is more of a convenient place to eat rather than a 'great' place to eat but its got a ton of options though from noodles to dim sum to congee. 
Not a bad late night spot. 
**service is A-OK at best**"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant to provide great tasting dishes.  I love the way they cook the food as it reminds me of the quality of food I would get years ago along Dundas  near Spadina.  We are always seated promptly and the tea is very hot.  We have frequented this place many times."}
{"text":"I frequently visit this place!

Why?
Flexible late hours, wide selection of food, real HK style food and drinks.  

My family got to know one of the servers who's worked there for over 15 years, Mark, that always recommends excellent dishes for us everytime.

They open until 2-3am depending on the day of the week.

We've tried many things on the menu, and they're always made well on a consistent basis.  If you come earliar in the night before 9pm, you'll be able to order BBQ meat (duck, pork, etc.)"}
{"text":"4 stars for food
3 stars for ambiance
3.5 stars for service

This is a typical HK style cafe that has almost everything you can think of.  Came here for breakfast this morning and there were 4 or 5 menus...the dim sum special before 11am menu, the dim sum set menu, the HK style western breakfast menu, the noodles, rice, etc menus.  I'm not actually a huge fan of breakfast at HK style cafe because it includes dishes like macaroni soup with ham & peas which I don't really care for.  My daughter and husband love this!  I like the fact that they have dim sum as well and I was really surprise that it was pretty good.  The set menus are also a good deal which comes with hot tea or coffee.  It's a great place for family with lots of selection for everyone.

This place has been around for at least 10 years and I totally forgot about it.  The place is quite spacious that probably can accommodate over 100 people.  There were 3 dim sum dishes that I liked the most which were the black bean spareribs steam rice, BBQ pork steam rice rolls and Chiu chow steam dumplings (meats & peanuts)......these were just as good as some of the fancy Chinese dim sum places like Dragon Boat and Premier Banquet.  The prices are also really reasonable, our total bill came to only $33 for 7 dishes and 2 milk teas.

If you're not looking for a fancy place but just want some good Chinese food, this is the place."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here as a pre-teen with my family for casual breakfasts. 

12 years later I only came in because I was desperate around 7PM on a Saturday and everywhere else was booked. 
Spoiler: I am going to trash them. 

My boyfriend and I got seated quickly as the place was half empty (bad sign). 

The waiter took our orders right away and we waited for our food. And waited. And waited. 

First, there was the dish cart (that employees empty dishes into from tables that leave and wheel it to the kitchen). But nope, this dish cart stood there and every time somebody would finish a dish I'd hear a huge crash behind my head. Ffs. Absolute 0 consideration. 

My vermicelli in soup comes out first and I dig in. The noodles were literally the worst grade you can find. Each mouthful I took had the hard chunks in it where it wasn't cooked properly. I added the spicy sauce in the tin container and it made my noodles sour?! I love my carbs but I left that bowl 90% full. 

The beef with guy lan (Chinese broccoli) was ok in presentation. Generous amounts of beef, big stack of veggies. Yet, the veggies were sooo old. You can tell when you bite into the stalk. 

My boyfriend's canton chow mein was crispy even though I didn't ask for it to be. Fine, we'd eat it anyways. But the seafood in it was so fishy. No, no, no way. 

The lemon ice tea I got at the end costed $4?! It was legit 50% ice. 

Richmond Court has severely gone downhill as the years went by. There's so many more (better) options around this area. I suggest you go a little further for them."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place as I usually come here when I'm too busy to cook dinner.

My go to meal is the corn & fried fish with rice.  They're very consistent in their quality and quantity of each dish.  


HOWEVER - I do not like finding hair in my food, ever.  & it's usually a very unforgivable offense for me.  The hair was underneath all the rice which I assume it to mean the cooks don't wear hairnets to prevent this issue from happening. 

[a picture will be up shortly] 

Can't come back, won't come back."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars
Richmond Court has been around for ages and it serves mediocre Chinese food. It's a mix of Hong Kong cafe style and conventional food court food. Good place to grab a cheap bite. My sisters and I came for breakfast and we got things like congee, macaroni with egg and sausage, steamed roll with deep fried dough stick, and deep fried donut. Standard fare Chinese food.      
There's also an in-house bakery section. Never tried their stuff but it's been there as long as the place has opened so I'm guessing it can't be that bad.

Ambiance: 3.5 stars
It's after Chinese new year but they still have the dragons up and there are so many of them! They are hung up around the restaurant and gives the whole place a good festive aura. Big spacious restaurant so you don't normally have to wait for a table and they're open late so that's a bonus if you're hungry late at night. Everything here is a little worn out but it has a nice 80s vibe.                

Service: 3 stars
If you're a regular here, you'll probably get slightly better service but all in all, it's standard Chinese restaurant service. We got whatever we asked for."}
{"text":"Richmond Court Restaurant is one of my top choices for Hong Kong Chinese style food. I've frequented Richmond Court (and its other location in Markham) for years now and I can't really deny the quality of food there. The service is pretty standard - nothing to really pick at.

REALLY busy during lunch hours, around 12-1PM, so if you're able to avoid those times, do so. You'll get your food and be out the door faster.

I recommend several dishes from here:

1. The Black Pepper Beef on Rice is always nice. Slices of beef with onion, corn, carrots, peas, and rice smothered in a thick black pepper sauce. Savoury and peppery, you can't go wrong with this dish.

2. Beef and Vegetable Chow Mein. Slices of beef and vegetables (depends on the location... it's usually Chinese broccoli or bok choy -whatever they have on hand) on a bed of yellow chow mein noodles. They do a good job of frying the noodles and the parts lathered in the sauce gives the dish a nice texture contrast. Crunchy and soft... I drool every time I think about it.

3. Pan Fried Turnip Cakes.... they're essentially like fried potatoes, but with an asian twist. Bits of green onion and pickled veg are embedded inside and they give that nice fresh and salty flavour.

Honestly, I don't think you can really go wrong with anything from their extensive menu list. Fast, delicious, and you can't go wrong with the price."}
{"text":"Where does the love for \"lam yoon\" come from? I think it's the unapologetic greasiness of the Taiwanese Beef Noodles (hong shao niu rou mian), the hot Horlick that they serve in a glass that makes it impossible to pick up without burning your fingers, the never changing staff, the availability of your fave hk diner food. 

On any given visit, I might order the beef noodles, hk style egg/ham sandwich, hk milk tea, fresh egg tarts, wonton soup, beef tendon noodles or condensed milk toast. Always always always love it. It's hk comfort food, it really is, and this place is always open so late. When a group of friends can't agree on where to go (sushi? no, someone's had sushi yesterday. Korean? No, not feeling like digging through pork bone. Viet? no...too slurpy), we can all agree on Richmond Court as a happy compromise.

Now, I'm not saying you should come here because the food will blow you away, or the service. But there's such an appeal to it! It appeals to me like those old American shows who talk about going to their local greasy diner - That's this place!"}
{"text":"The food here is tasty (but lower quality) chinese food that is fast.  I like coming here when I'm in a rush and need my order delivered the moment I put it in, which is what this place does, so I appreciate it.  Waitresses usually don't speak English, so you better learn how to point at what you want.  You get what you pay for, so I can't complain...the best part about this place is the speed of their service.  They want you in and out of there as quickly as possible, so when you're in a hurry and know exactly what you want to eat come to this place.

PS - Their washrooms are nastyyyy.  Don't use them."}
{"text":"Richmond Court Restaurant Bakery is 2 store on the left of Richmond Court Restaurant sandwiching Lucullus Bakery.

If you look through the front window from outside, you will not see anything because they are all fogged up!! When you walk in, you will know why... there are steamers warming the dim sums and the rice they sell. Dim Sums are $1.75 per order and Rice with chicken/beef/spare ribs are $3.50 with tea or coffee.

There are also Chinese buns and Western style cakes... I have to say the slice cakes are the smallest I ever seen! priced between $1.50 to $1.70, they are so thinly sliced!! It is an embrassment when you trying to get it for your friends and they wondering how cheap I am when the cake slice is so small!

The lady that served me just give me that tiny cake slice and asked me to hold on to it and go pay at the cashier?!! Gee... at least help me put it in a bag or something.. 

There are some seatings if you do decide to eat in... but I don't think it will be a pleasure experience, since you will smell like dim sum after and your glasses might be all fogged up because of the steam...

Good selection of Cantonese Comfort food: congee and noodles.. which is good for any time of the day and all priced reasonably.

Service always fast and efficient. And trust me, if you are hungry and it is past midnight.. what Richmond Court has is good good food!

HK milk tea is quite decent too.. not too many places you can find those old traditional thick rim tea cup..."}

Seems like the food quality is going downhill...

The steamed fish dumplings was one of the worse I had! So doughy with too much flour and taste bland too. Even the frozen one I get from supermarket tastes better than that!

The deep fried wonton though is decent, maybe I just like anything that is deep fried with sweet and sour sauce?! The wrapping though was quite crispy. I finished the whole order by myself...

Milk tea was meh.. 

The only good thing is the Free Wifi.. We ended up hang around here for 90 minute on X'mas Day when a lot of other business were closed for the holidays.

$3.99 for our afternoon tea set that comes with a drink, though reasonably priced!

Service is still friendly and efficient..."}

WORST EXPERIENCE + FOOD POISONING.
I first compared this restaurant to a ghetto China restaurant, but ahaha this is incomparable.
I'd rather eat in China with the kitten-sized rats, they actually serve better food~
welp, for me, never again~ XD"}
{"text":"There prices have gone up a lot in the past year there calamari used to be around 8.50 and now there like 13 dollars"}
{"text":"This location is not the same as the Richmond Court in Richmond Hill. The food quality at this location is a lot worst. Even though the menu is the same, what they make in the restaurant and the bakery is a lot less than what they can offer. The stuffed green pepper that we had was weird it did not look correct (looks somewhat grey) or taste right. The soup noodles in takeout form looks like it has been coated with something. There was one time when a customer was complaining how fishy their fried rice taste. 

Not sure if the food is worth the price that they list it."}
{"text":"Never sat down to eat here but it's a good grab-and-go place. They're constantly baking fresh Chinese pastries throughout the day and it smells so good when I go in the morning and during lunch. Prices are reasonable. Don't forget to order one of their delicious milk teas for $2.40 to go with your bun! Order from the bakery counter if you want to customize your sugar level. If you order from the restaurant side, they'll add in (a lot) of sugar for you."}
{"text":"TLDR: It's an okay Chinese food place to visit if you're looking for a meal for under $10. 

Came here with a friend on a Saturday afternoon around 1:00pm. We weren't sure where to go, so we just looked for a place with a lot of people - which, became this diner/Chinese food place. We were seated fairly quickly and handed menus - which were in English (to all those who don't read Chinese ahah - this includes myself). 
The menu is must like the typical Chinese diners, plus a little more dinnery food items (lobster, crab, entrees). 
We ordered a wonton noodle soup, fried dough covered with rice noodles (forgot what that's called), and chicken curry with rice and a half coffee/tea drink - our meal came out to be around $25. What stuck out the most was  their wontons - they were super big! But other than that, the food was okay."}
{"text":"This place is in desperate need of a renovation. Eating here feels like I'm eating in my friends Chinese family members basement. 

It is affixed to a small Asian mall, with a bakery at the mall entrance. Side entrance from outside brings you right into the restaurant. 

Service here sucks, I thought it was maybe because of me being the only non Asian person in the establishment, but fellow Yelp reviews have stated the same. I've been 3 times, always the same. 

Food is ok, sometimes good, for the price but never great or out of this world. I come back here solely for the PRICE not the quality of food. 

2/5 for me."}
{"text":"A safe choice for late snackers or if you can't decide on what to eat. Their food makes you full, not make you want more of it. They have a few good staple foods like the iced red bean freeze and some of the noodles. 

Prices are considered to be cheaper than other restaurants of the same nature. 

They have a staggering amount of items on the menu but try to avoid ordering fancier stuff like the sushi and seafood. 

I would say the service is of typical Chinese quality. Lots of Westerners come so they are more English-speaking friendly than other places."}
{"text":"Richmond Court or Nam Yuen (South Court) has been a fixture of the \"Golden Plaza\" (Wong Gum) shopping center by Highway 7 & Chalmers since 1992/93 era. It is right in the corner near the Chinese supermarket and is hard to miss.

Side note: \"Wong Gum\" Plaza is named after a famous shopping arcade in Hong Kong, notably Kowloon's Sham Shui Po area, which in the 1980s was famous for stores selling Apple 2 clone computers and hardware and accessories,  and ahem the vendors there being the early pioneers of bootleg software on 3.5\" floppy disks. Games were like $1.50 a pop, and pretty much started the revolution of A$N CHEAPNE$$ where HK ppl believe as a result of such rampant availability at low prices, that  software, services, media, music etc should be made more available cheaply and widely, an attitude and perhaps ingrained culture, that sadly persists to this day amongst some consumers. Why do you think A$Ns and AZNs love low quality low tech bargains or copies of originals? Can't afford a Rolex? Get a RoDex instead at the night market for cheap! Or a Prada wallet? Hey there's PraPa, don't fret. You don't want to know what the clone brand of DKNY is called.

Their success throughout the years has allowed them to expand into the Times Square plaza about 5 minutes away, with much bigger and slightly tidier digs, although last time in 2003 when I passed by it, the bigger and supposedly much better looking place started to look a bit old and tired.

This first location of Richmond Court has a local HK style cafe feel, more stripped down, where expat$ and A$Ns alike flock here for the usual classics, HK style western food and drink, coexisting with HK Cantonese common fare classics like won ton noodles, shui gow dumplings (10+ years ago used to be the best in town), beef brisket noodles or over rice, and related ilk.

A decent affordable place if you're in need of basic Cantonese comfort food, although I'd argue if you need congee, you may want to try (if it is still around) \"Dai Fai Woot\" right in the corner closer to Chalmer's side (perfect snack into the moderately late hours of  pre midnight even for the A$N after his golf game).

Easily 4 stars by San Francisco Bay Area standards, but for the pickiest of A$Ns and locals, and due to its history/age, I'm slotting it at a more grounded keepin it realz 3."}
{"text":"Their food quality varies all the time... sometimes their wonton noodles are super soggy. Other times, it's amazing. 

I order takeout and buy bakery goods here. I don't remember ever sitting in the restaurant. The takeouts are often quickly done, occasional mistakes on orders, and the food not always hot. 

This place is a 2 star for me.... but deep fried fish skins for $2.50 are SUPER YUMMY and crispy and go very well with hot soups! I couldn't find this on the menu, I saw someone else with this dish and asked the waitress. Will come back for fish skins :)!"}
{"text":"Plates.  Utensils. We're pretty dirty. Found a pair of chopsticks with green mildew on it. Don't get the drinks here as its pretty shitty. Found one with a hair inside the bubble Tea.  The food doesn't seem to be of quality hence the name food court .Food seems to be loaded with msg and lots of it. Was so thirsty after. And it is expensive too. Thought it would be cheaper due to the quality of the food.  But charge you like it's 5 stars restaurant. Waiter and waitresses looks like they don't even want to work there.  Maby due to management and wage issue."}
