{"text":"Close by,  but probably overlooked, it's a standard falafel place I'd say.  Hot sauce is spicy enough,  falafel made fresh.    Not too busy, but ample seating is available.     I ordered 6 small falafel pieces at $4.50 before taxes.     They also have coconut sweets like cupcakes that are pretty delish."}
{"text":"This is one of the greater mid east joints in toronto. My friends rave about their mini falafels that are bite size and delish, but I always settle for the kefta kebab dinner with rice and salad. Portions are generous.  It is extremely clean here! There are seats with tables to enjoy your food, and you can stand at the front and watch your food being made.  The workers are all very kind people.  Will always go back without a doubt."}
{"text":"This is the best sharwarma joint so far in my book. The thing that makes their sharwarma better than others is their garlic sauce. The owner is such a humble guy, great food great people definitely woth going back"}
