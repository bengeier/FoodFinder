{"text":"Had lunch on a recent Friday afternoon. We started with the Cucuzza Fritti, panko crusted planks of zucchini with an aioli. They were delicious and crispy, seasoned with  fresh cracked pepper. The aioli was creamy and tangy. 
We followed with the Classico pizza which had mozzarella di bufala, roasted tomatoes, carmelized onions and sauteed mushrooms. It was very good. The tomatoes were sweet, the cheese creamy and the carmelized onions were a revelation. The only complaint was that the onions were sparse. My first piece had none at all and they really were the star of the pizza. The crust was thin and crispy. We had good service from our waitress even though she seemed to be waiting on every table in the restaurant. Overall a very tasty and pleasant lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I am in Cleveland I come here and the food has always been perfect!! Authentic fresh Italian and family owned! Five stars for the food but service can be alittle better!"}
{"text":"I feel like a slug rating this place two stars, because they deserve at least 5 stars for their choice of ingredients. Good quality stuff goes into their food. My challenge is that I'm not a fan at all of the paper thin cracker crust. If you are like me and favor the thicker, saucier, Chicago-style type of pies, you will leave this place feeling empty. My husband and I ordered appetizer, salad, and pizza, and felt that we had little more than a snack. It would be a great place to stop in downtown before or after some drinks at a bar to take the edge off, but it's not quite a destination spot for me."}
{"text":"Will be back! I travel to Cleveland several times a month.. Found this place on Yelp and it was wonderful!
Casual yet quaint...perfect little place for any occasion.  Authentic Italian food, with great atmosphere. Something for everyone.
A little pricey, but we'll worth it!"}
{"text":"Crostata's menu is simple, yet clearly authentic and well- executed. Everything appears to be made in house from the handmade ravioli to the grated cheese on the table. A beautiful wine list was explained to us by the hostess upon being seated. Servers were efficient and caring. My daughter had pizza which was thin ,crispy , and delectable. I tried the house made cavatelli with meatballs/ everything was out of this world and delicious. For dessert, we had the the limone napolean- to die for. You can tell a lot about a restaurant from the staff and these folks seemed to genuinely be happy and proud of the food they served. Another indication is the restrooms - which were spotless, well stocked, and unisex- very forward thinking place to be sure. Oh- I almost forgot- a great selection of Italian imports for sale as well. Get here, people!"}
{"text":"Upon arrival, the hostess greeted us. She had a slight attitude, but gave us a nice table by the window. Our Waitress was very slow , had a little bit of an attitude and definitely pushy . My wedding soup was excellent. The NY Strip arugula salad was only ok. The steak was a little too fatty. The crostata dessert wasn't that great . You could tell that it was made in house and they make a lot of them and freeze them. Not a good technique . It's a close call between 2 & 3 stars. The owner was nice and remembered my name on the way out, so they get 3 out of 5 stars. I may return in the future ."}
{"text":"Definitely in my top 2 pizzas in Cleveland, and probably the most authentic to Napoletano pizza you can get in Cleveland. We've never had a bad experience here. I'd eat it everyday if I could!"}
{"text":"Usually i'm a fan of the thick crust pan pizzas, but I had been craving the thin crusty goodness of an authentic Neapolitian pie.  Apart from your typical mall pizza reheating establishment,  I was having the darndest time finding a place that would satisfy my hand tossed hunger. It just so happened that Crostastas had just opened a bit ago and it was practically right down the street from me.  

As you walk in you see the open kitchen with its huge brick wood fired pizza oven (apparently imported brick by brick from Italy) where the 'Pizzaioli' creates his masterpieces.   My Husband and I shared the 'Insalata Mista' (mixed greens w/ strawberries and balsamic vinaigrette) and a Margherita pizza (just San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, basil and ex.virgin olive oil).  Both were excellent.  The pizza was the perfect combination of crispy and chewy that I had been craving, with sweet tomatoes, fresh basil, drizzled rich buttery olive oil and creamy mozzarella.  It was simple but those simple ingredients worked so well together, hiding nothing.   Crostatas makes simply one of the best pizzas in Cleveland hands down."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in the Cleveland area.  I grew up in NJ and have yet to find good NJ/NY pizza in the area until now.  Drove 30 minutes and it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Truly authentic Napolitano style wood fire oven pizza.  Ingredients are top shelf, as is the atmosphere and service.  

This is how pizza is meant to be made.  If you can't make a trip to Italy for the real thing, then experience it here.  Best pizza in Cleveland!

As if the pizza isn't good enough, the wedding soup also won me over, and that is no small feat!  It is the closest to \"mom's\" as I have tasted yet."}
{"text":"If you want REAL Italian food, you must try Crostata's!  My husband and I decided to split some appetizers rather than ordering a main course. The wedding soup was authentic and homemade. The meatballs were as good as mine :-) and the arancini balls were delectable! We also had a few ravioli to go with the meatballs! Even though we were very satisfied we decided to indulge in dessert. Okay, you absolutely have to order a cannoli. My mom made the best, but these were a close second (I had to say that or she would haunt me from heaven).  We each had a few bites and took the remainder home. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I was stopping by this place during a business trip. Their pizza is simple and impressive. You don't need a billion toppings. I got the Prosciutto and Arugula Pizza. It came with those two ingredients and a little cheese. Simple and perfect! TRY THEIR PIZZA NOW!"}
{"text":"We loved absolutely everything. Wedding soup, ravioli, breaded zucchini, pizza not to mention the tiramisu and cannoli. Overall very reasonably priced. We will be back again very soon"}
{"text":"Loved the wedding soup and pizza.  The dessert was to die for.  Server was excellent.  Great, clean restaurant.  We'd rather patronize local businesses and we will be back."}
{"text":"Crostata's is the real deal; authentic Napoli style pizza. The owner's commitment to authenticity is admirable -- for this area it's one of the few wood burning ovens that gets hot enough to bubble the crust. Just walking in you are hit with the aroma of Italia! Also : no pepperoni (which kills pizza, really) and wonderful toppings such as carmelized onion, buffalo mozz.  In my book, his (or NY style which is unavailable in CLE) is the only pizza  worth the carbs.


As for the location; it's close to my work, so good for lunches , but what a strange place to put such a restaurant. Certainly it would fare better in the more tony east suburbs such as shaker, beachwood, pike? Open a branch please!"}
{"text":"We came here based on the reviews. We were very disappointed. We got the prosciutto and melon - the prosciutto was dried out and the melon wasn't ripe (they didn't even use the usual cantaloupe). When we told the waitress, she just said \"oh.\" The cavatelli was tough, not melt in your mouth. The meatballs and pizza were very average. I think we could have made better at home. The service was poor and slow (and we went super early with only about 5 other diners there)"}
{"text":"Very nice artisanal style pizza with a great crust that gave a delightful chew, and a delicate sauce; but basil leaves on top were left in the oven too long, so that was not so pleasant a bite."}
{"text":"While I fully agree with the excellent pizza ratings the real star of the show is the potato encrusted sea bass. Never had better. Aranchini and zucchini are excellent appetizers. The salads are amazing: Caesar, prime rib on arugula and strip steak salad are wonderful. If you are fortunate to be in the area for lunch then do NOT miss John's favorite roasted beef and red pepper sandwich. Can be busy from 6:15 to 7:30 and no reservations for smaller groups."}
{"text":"Having travelled around Italy for a bit, I can tell you that this has the most delicious authentic pizza I have ever had here in the United States. It's absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza that I have ever eaten. The crust is delicious - well everything is delicious.The wood-fired stove makes a huge difference.  Their pasta and sauce are homemade and very special.  I also love the salad with the strawberries.

I don't normally eat dessert, but they have this lemon napoleon dessert that is so light, airy and delcious - i am still craving more.

This is one of three restaurants that I always make sure I go to when I come to visit my family in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Everything was great, food, service, and even the pistachios. The decor is excellent and the washrooms were immaculate. A little bit on the pricy side, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"this pizza rules! they use basil and fresh mozzarella and only the freshest ingredients! in the top 5 pizzas ive ever had! crust is awesome! great salads too and very friendly service-pop is a ripoff though-you get a small glass bottle for 1.75 we had 2 each, it was 7.00 for 4 little sodas. everything else is great though"}
{"text":"Loved it! Nice inside. Comfortable. Small inside but not too cramped. They have a pizza oven from Italy. Service was good and friendly, we got there about 1:00, the lunch rush was really kicking in. 3 of us had the grilled chicken breast, it was delicious! Breaded, perfectly seasoned, crisp on the outside, but not too crispy, and tender on the inside. Thin, so it was easy to cut. My husband had the stuffed ravioli with the meatballs. He said they were great! We will be going back!!"}
{"text":"Great gem of a restaurant. Usually head there once a month. Service always very friendly and italian food prepared great!"}
{"text":"Wonderful thin crust pizza with fresh ingredients.  Excellent, friendly service.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Restaurant is a bit too cold.
Soda is served in tiny bottles instead of fountain-dispensed. Annoying. 
Plus side:  they are gracious about customizing and super gracious in general.  They remade my pizza due to my misunderstanding and it was perfect the second time.
House made cheese ravioli is AWESOME.
Nice dessert selections.  Nutella calzone is excellent and beautifully presented.
Parking lot is a little tight but manageable.
Fantastic restrooms.
Big plus!  They are open all day, not just lunch and dinner hours."}
{"text":"Went to this place on the recommendation of a foodie, but was REALLY not impressed.  Bad night, perhaps?

It had all the fixings of a promising place (with gorgeous antipasti on display on their prep counter, and even teased with some great appetizers.  But the pizza, the piece de resistance, fell flat.

Upsides: risotto ball with chevre was absolutely delicious.  A creamy blend of the risotto and chevre, and the tangy tomato sauce that was just acidic enough to cut through the parmesan.

Downsides:  The pesto is made with walnuts!  Even though it says pine nut pesto on the menu, it also contains walnuts.  Why!!!???

The pizza dough fell flat on at least two levels:  the crust wasn't thin enough to be anything distinctive, and held none of the woodfired oven flavor I'd been hoping for.  The dough seemed so dense and overly glutenous, as well as tasteless that I could have thought they pulled it frozen out of a case of premade crusts.

Disappointed.  That said, the toppings were really good."}
{"text":"This was by far the best food and service that we have received the week we have spent in Cleveland. My son declared his pizzza the best ever. My husband raved on his pasta and sausage. I also tip my hat to our server. She was great. It was also the first service personal that we have seen smile in this city."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  First of all, we found this place through the owner of a pizza place, Pauly G's, in Brooklyn, NY....we have been going here, and bringing all of our friends for the past 2 years....now that we live be in FL and cannot come often, we find an opportunity to re-visit every time we are in town.....their risotto balls and antipasto misto are the best....their home made spumoni is OUTSTANDING.....everything in between is TOP NOTCH!

Always great service, outstanding food and good value!"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner and we got the antipasto misto appetizers and the Classico pizza. Appetizers was a sample of charcuterie, cheese, and olives with home made bread made from pizza dough. It was delicious! 
The pizza was amazingly good too. Home made caramelized onions, tomatoes, and dough. Great pizza! Good service and nice place. Great experience for an Italian dinner!"}
{"text":"There is nothing more gauche than a television in a dining room. What do they think they're running here? A TGI Friday's? 

They have a Stefano Ferrara oven which many consider to be the \"Ferrari of Pizza Ovens\". The only problem? They use it like it's an '83 Reliant K. The pizzas spend a lot longer than 90 seconds in that beautiful oven. A pity really. (To be fair, Valenti's has the same oven and their temps are even lower and cook times longer.)

The food tastes fine, but the experience could be soooo much better if they just got rid of the tv and decided to get serious about their dough.

No reservations, no bar to wait at."}
{"text":"Crostata's is absolutely one of both myself and my family's favorite pizza restaurants in Cleveland! Outside of Little Italy, I challenge you to find a better spot for fresh pizza in Cleveland. You can't. 

The food is so fresh, you think that you are sitting in Italy. The caprese salad is incredible, the pizza is amazing, and there is a variety of entree choices. The service is great, although the decor of the restaurant seems too \"sterile\".  Parking is convenient and free. 

Crostata's needs to be added to your \"go to\" list. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"This is the closest thing to the kind of pizza you get in Italy can be found anywhere in this area. Thin crispy crust, fresh ingredients, cooked perfectly-in a word-awesome. I have a friend who was brought up in Italy who I sent to this restaurant. He said this pizza really reminded him of what he got in his hometown of Bologna."}
{"text":"I don't know why I waited until this week to sample some of the best pizza in the Cleveland area. Between Crostada's and Sweet Basil, I'm set!

The ambiance of this randomly-located restaurant is a comfortable, familiar one. Everything is nice, but not too fancy. The smells were incredible. Well, duh.

The specials, such as ravioli, looked amazing, but I couldn't not order pizza at Crostadas! Are you kidding me? Anyway. I started with the Wedding Soup. A nice-sized portion with a delicious breadstick -- a little tease of the wonderful dough to come.

My husband, friend, and I ordered two pizzas to share, which was just enough (any more and I would have been stuffing myself, because Lord knows that, with the delectable wood-oven pizzas, there ARE no leftovers). We got the Margherita D.O.C. and the one just below it -- don't remember the name, but it had smoked garlic (huge cloves) and roasted red peppers. I was definitely more of a Margherita fan, as the smoked nature of the garlic was a little intense for me. In fact, I pretty much know that whenever I go to a place like this, the Margherita is the way to go.

Now, it was delicious. It deserves five stars. Have I had better? Yes. However, it was great,  and pizza here is really special, and that's what I'm rating it on.

Service was friendly, but took a really long time. They were sort of busy, but not overly so, and I know the pizzas only take like a minute and a half to cook, so I'm not sure what caused the delay.

Um, and I can just say that I am writing this review in a dark room nibbling on some of our NUTELLA CALZONE that we took to go. Genius!"}
{"text":"Fresh food,  family owned, and authentic.   Their sausage is made in house and is so good that they sell it to the public.     All of our pizzas and appetizers were excellent."}
{"text":"Really nice mixed salad with Balsamic and had stuffed shells. Sauce was spicy and good. Prices were a bit high.  Service was fair."}
{"text":"We have eaten here numerous times.  We unanimously agreed that the house-made ravioli is the best thing in the menu.  And we cannot figure out why the heck they just don't add the Filet Mignon to the menu because it is a special every night. Huh?  Take that Fred Flintstone steak off the menu and add the filet. My OCD self wants to help them reorganize the space. They literally work in the smallest counter space.  Get all that alcohol off the counter and up high and give yourself more room to place desserts!  And the counter in the front is wasted space with all those boxed cakes and stuff like that.   Service is slow during busy times like Friday and Saturday nights around 7pm."}
{"text":"yeah yeah, its a quote-unquote real pizza place, thats for sure. even compared to the places in europe. which always makes me wonder about the whole \"you can't find REAL pizza outside of italy, feh!\" attitude. i mean... one; define real pizza, and twol i'm pretty sure san marzano tomatos are exported globally.

anyways, a small italian menu with the deadly nutella calzone on the dessert menu. all the pizzas are real italian-y fair with my favorite, fried egg and capi. last star is a save out for some eency service issues (its a tad spotty) and some minor inconsistencies with the capicola, which to be fair, i find to be a really inconsistent ingredient.

the crust/bread is excellent and is probably one of my top pizza crusts ever, the wedding soup is hands down the best in the cleveland area, sauce is sweet and orange, and the mozzarella is sliced not shredded. aka autentico italiano or whatever.

nice small area, and a sort of homey upscale-ish vibe with clean walls decorated with \"typical italian restaurant\" decorations, and a charming little lego house thing on the front desk to add an adorable family touch for anyone jaded by the above \"typical italian restaurant\" decorations. another subtle touch is that the TVs are more often than not on some sort of Formula 1 race. VERY italian."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and a couple of woodfired pizzas and we were quite pleased.  It was pretty darn good wood fired pizza.  We had a Quattro formaggio (add arugula) and a margarita DOC pizza.  Both were very good."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for Italian food. We had the much acclaimed Margherita D.O.C. Pizza, and shared the arancini, grilled eggplant, and stuffed peppers. The pizza was probably the best I've ever had - the crust is perfect. The tomatoes are perfect. The buffalo mozzarella is perfect. You get the picture. It was really light for a pizza. The arancini was delicious and not too heavy. The eggplant was super thin and perfectly grilled. The stuffed peppers were fine - this is never an item I'm particularly fond of. My one complaint would be the tiramisu - it was not especially tasty and was previously frozen. There was a thin layer of ice remaining. Skip that and have a perfect meal!"}
{"text":"Ordered the zucchini appetizer. It comes with a mayo like dipping sauce that needed more of a kick. We asked for marinara. Zucchini was nice and crispy but could have used some salt. Also ordered the sausage pizza and cavatelli with meatball. Meatball was tasty. Pasta is homemade. Thought pizza was ok. Didn't care for the sausage. No Citizen Pie. Prices are reasonable but prob wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Saturday night. It was packed. We got a seat in the corner. I liked that. 

We ordered a antipasto salad and a pizza. The antipasto platter was huge. A family could eat it. There was just 2 of us. We ended up bringing some of it home. The pizza was good as well. Very crispy and soft crust. Perfect combo. Brought that home too. They were also good leftovers.

Service was just ok. The girl taking care of us was not that personable. Didn't really talk or smile at all. She seemed like maybe she did not have enough experience... possibly. I did not think she cared or was very good. The Hostess was nice. So I think it was our server. 

Prices were on the high side. Food is good and the quality is there. So your paying for it. This is good for date night. Not necessarily family night. 

I'll go back."}
{"text":"This place is nice and seems like a place families like to come for simple fresh pizzas.  It's pretty good.  The arancini was delicious.  The pizzas were cooked perfectly with fresh ingredients...true italian style pizza.  Though the margherita pizza was great, the prosciutto e arugula wasn't that great; I wish the prosciutto was cut up a little rather than placing huge pieces of the meat with some arugula.  Plus, the service was pretty slow and the place wasn't that busy.  But overall, I think the food is worth coming and trying.

Also, if you like nutella, they sell a huge tub of nutella for like $60 or something like that....my girlfriend and I did think about it."}
{"text":"A nice restaurant. I enjoyed a great pizza for lunch and need to bring my husband back for dinner. A nice, bright space that is casual but very enjoyable."}
{"text":"This is just like visiting a trattoria in Italy.  Servers are great and the great grandson of the cook is really nice. A family restaurant to cherish."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience.  The pasta was fresh and delicious.  I enjoyed a large bowl of wedding soup.  Missing a dash of salt but otherwise tasty.  Our pizza was comprised of fresh basil, artichokes, and peppers.  The sauce was on the sweeter side.  The crust was thin."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed. The food is amazing! The service is very good and the atmosphere is warm and friendly. Everything is homemade and delicious. Best thin crust wood fired pizza in Cleveland! Skip Little Italy and go to Crostatas if you want amazing pizza! The pasta is excellent too! Get the Cavatelli with sausage! Their sauce is so good you'll want to clean your plate with their fresh homemade bread!! The wedding soup is so good you'll think your Nonna was in the kitchen and made it just for you!! The Insalata Mista is really good, enough for two people to share. Definitely save room for dessert, the Napolean Al Limone is to die for! You'll dream about it for months after!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, authentic....The homemade cavatelli with red sauce is a real treat. The pizza's and salads are perfect.  Save room for the nutella calzone :-)."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my husband and it was fantastic! We got the stuffed banana peppers and the Italian sausage pizza and were in heaven! It was just like the pizza i used to get in Europe. Nice thin crust and full of fresh ingredients. If you want great pizza go here!"}
{"text":"Molto deliziosa! We ordered several appetizers and salads and figured we would order a pizza but we were too stuffed from the appetizers to even think about pizza. We enjoyed the Antipasto Misto which was an assortment of meats, cheeses and olives and the stuffed artichoke. The antipasto was the freshest I've ever had and was accented with an out of this world balsamic reduction. The artichoke did not impress me nearly as much, I found the leaves much too mushy. For salads, we ordered the Caesar and Caprese, both were unbelievably fresh with the perfect amount of dressing. I did, of course, save room for dessert and thankfully so because it ended up joining the ranks as one of the top ten best desserts I've ever eaten. I ordered the lemon napolean which consisted of amazingly light and crispy layers of pastry dough, sandwiched between some seriously delicious lemon curd and topped off with some real whipped cream and drizzled with a raspberry sauce.

The only thing stopping me from giving Crostata's 5 stars was the service. Upon being seated, we waited, no exaggeration 20 minutes to even be acknowledged by our server and it was another 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive at the table. I couldn't imagine going here for your lunch hour as we were here for almost 2 hours, so getting in and out seemed out of the question. For lunch, it was a bit on the expensive side but I am always willing to pay more for quality so I was one happy camper upon leaving."}
{"text":"I am not a big pizza eater. I was in the mood so I tried this place. The Alba was fantastic, but the cannoli is exceptional!"}
{"text":"This place is such a surprise! I never would have guessed that this small pizza place on a random corner in the burbs would have some of the most delicious pizza around.

I'm with Rachael N. -- after trying a bunch of places, I think Crostata's tops Dewey's and Bar Cento. I think it rivals Angelo's, but in a different way...

Crostata's values authenticity. They really care about their food and how to prepare it well. I came here for lunch and we ordered the panko zucchini slices and Classico pizza... and it was so delicious. The zucchini was freshly and perfectly fried with panko. They had some aioli on the side but that was a little too much with the parmesan already sprinkled on top. I'm not complaining too much though. 

The first time I had the classico was when some friends brought home leftovers and re-heated it with the very specific instructions given to them by the people at the restaurant. (They said not to do it any other way. To me, this feels so legit. You know it's good!) This pizza is so good--perfectly caramelized onions, tomatoes, and mushrooms with fresh basil on perfectly baked thin crust. Not too heavy, not too light...

I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for good pizza!"}
{"text":"If they lowered the price I would give it 5 stars. Solid pesto shrimp pizza, and really good fried zucchini"}
{"text":"Loved it! The pizza is fresh and very good. Like the friendly atmosphere and side dishes. Worth the drive and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I called in a lunch order for take out on Friday on my way to clinic.  The restaurant stands by itself and was very clean when i went in to pick up my order.  The margarita pizza was delicious with the crust being thin and good flavors.  Eventually, I'd like to go back and sit down and eat here, but the food leaves you wanting to come back for more"}
{"text":"No thank you. We ended up here one night coming home from the mall. The food was WAY over priced and nothing to rave about. The portions were small and we laughed knowing what the price tag was. The two stars was for the hostess that was very nice to keep a conversation with us for a few minutes. After that the service was just as good as the food, blah. I feel like they want to be \"upscale\" but can't hold up to it. We were happy to pay the check just to get out of there. 

If you really want to try eating here go for lunch with friends, order a pizza and split the bill. The ingredients are good and the crust is thin. This is probably the only item worth buying."}
{"text":"Extremely authentic family style Italian restaurant.  Great food and customer service.  Hidden gem well worth the visit either with family, friends or even business lunches."}
{"text":"The most authentic Italian pizza anywhere!  There is not much more to say, because this place cuts no corners, just prepares phenominal pizza using an Italian wood-fired brick oven that leaves a crisp, slightly charred crust.  In addition to fabulous pizza, they also serve pasta dishes as well as salads."}
{"text":"This update only needs two words:

Nutella calzone."}
{"text":"OMG. The worst service ever. We ordered an appetizer and it took 40 minutes. My husband ordered the Margareta pizza and I ordered the Cavetelli and meatballs. My husband's pizza was served 10 minutes before my meal. My dinner was shy 1 meatball. Once I was finished, they brought 2 more. The pizza was doughy and everything was under seasoned.  My husband ordered a second beer and the waitress brought a different kind. Overall it was a really disappointing dinner."}
{"text":"After seeing a high rating and their great reviews in yelp, we decided to give them a try. Upon entering the restaurant you see their nice open kitchen, they have a variety of dried pastas for purchase to take home. We were seated promptly in the dinning room, the only downside is that the tables are right on top of each other. Reading the menu everything sounded amazing. Service was good, not great. 

We ordered the the arancini balls, melanzane alla Griglia (marinated and grilled eggplant). Tonno Carpaccio (seared ahi tuna, mesclun greens, mozz, ginger and sesame dressing). Quattro Formaggi pizza with sausage and farm egg). The presentation on all the dishes was spectacular and was cooked perfectly the problem was nothing had any flavor. The salad had way to much dressing, (even though we asked for the dressing on the side) the eggplant was really oily. Everything seemed to lack any seasoning, it was just bland for our taste."}
{"text":"Absolutely THE best!

Time after time, visit after visit this place puts out the finest pizza in the city. It may not be the same style as some other popular favorites, but they remain the most exciting pies in the area.

We typically start with the Caesar Salad. Just the right amount of crunch, dressing and great croutons. Perfect. We're addicted to the Prosciutto Arugula Pizza. Light, lemony with a crust that has my wife begging for the ends!  This always reminds me of the pizza I had in Milan. It is just that good. To finish, we really enjoy their tiramisu. We also love the Nutella Calzone, but typically can't finish it ( and it doesn't warm well at home)

We're told, the secret is the ultra hot Italian oven.  Perhaps. Honestly, we don't care! All we really want is the great stuff that come out of the oven! We'll always come back for more!"}
{"text":"My first time at Crostatas, even though we live just a few minutes away.  My daughter and I went on a Thursday evening and the restaurant was pretty full.  We ordered (2) Insalata Mista salads, which consisted of fresh spring greens, strawberries and a balsamic dressing (homemade), which was accompanied by a warm and chewy breadstick (yum!).  We also ordered the Margherita pizza with italian sausage.   Our meal was Excellent, the pizza was chewy with just the right amount of crunch and toppings.   Service was a little bit slow, but other than that, I can't wait to go back.....soon!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped in after passing this restaurant so many times over the years.  The Wedding Soup passed my wife's litmus evaluation with flying colors! We had the Quattro Stagoni Pizze which was vibrant with fresh ingredients.  Not the best we've ever had but very good pizza.  Coming back to try some Anitipasti which looked amazing!"}
{"text":"It was OK.  The pizza was a little sparse and floppy.  The flavor was fine but not something to rave about.  Might give it another go given the strong reviews by everyone else but I just wasn't blown away"}
{"text":"nothing better than a good thin-crust pizza with fresh, simple ingredients....I don't like to mess up a good thing by slathering it with too many toppings.  Ranks right up there with the best pizza places in NYC and I will definitely travel the 30 min it takes for me to get there when I get my pizza cravings  ;o)"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to check out Crostata's because my sister in law and brother in law have raved about it. We started with salads and the risotto ball appetizer. The ARANCINI Risotto balls were amazaballs !!!!!! Then we ordered pizza ( the Classico and SALSICCIA .) The favorite of the table was the Salsiccia ! So good. I ordered the cavatelli's and sauce with meatballs. I loved the marinara sauce but it was a little runny for my liking. My daughter and husband loved there meatballs. Last but not least there partly imported and homemade Spumoni was so good. My daughter ate the whole portion. Dworf itself would go back and try another pizza and the lemon dessert next time !!"}
{"text":"Crostata's IS all that.

There is nothing like this in Cleveland. This pizza reminds me of the pies I had in New York City. The super thin crust is chewy and light. The high quality toppings just melt in your mouth. 

We started off with Cucuzza Fritti (deep fried zucchini) and the Peperone Ripieno (sausage stuffed hot peppers). Both were amazing. The marinara on the peppers was perfect and included a huge fluffy warm bread stick. 

We then moved on to the Alba (San Marzano tomatoes, capicola, arugula, fresh egg, grana padana cheese and olive oil) and Margherita D.O.C. (SM tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, basil and olive oil) pizzas. This is by far, my new favorite pizza. It's just perfect. Thin, flavorful and not full of sauce. The toppings are allowed to really shine. And can we say FRESH MOZZARELLA?! Oi vay!

To end this perfect meal, we had the Nutella Calzone. Yes, I said Nutella. Warm, chewy, sweet goodness.

Culinary perfection."}
{"text":"We came here after a funeral with a party that started at 8 people and grew to 17. The staff was patient and accommodating , even when it came time to split up the bill. This is a very hospitable establishment. The food is very good. I recommend the pizza, house salad, chicken cutlet and the Nutella calzone. Just bring a crowd with at least 3 kids if you plan on knocking off that calzone. The pizza is unquestionably the best on the east side of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Service was friendly but awful,  food was sloppy and had little flavor, the manager was very rude.  The worst i ha e ever seen!  He followed our party out to our car! First experience at Crostata's was delightful each attempt from there sadly declines each visit and that will be my last, I have been in the industry my entire life."}
{"text":"Great food, nice folks! Literally can't go wrong here! If you don't want the pizza so many choices to choose from. The rice balls are a favorite as well as the Cesar salad!"}
{"text":"Once again Yelp hits the nail on the head. This is very good...not great but should not be missed. 

This kind of pizza is hard to find; thinner crust, woodfired, mozzerella...not the gobs and gobs of cheese. 

I also had their Pasta Fagoli soup, which I could have done without. A bit disappointed about their wines coming in a juice glass, but it was good enough

Service was also 4 stars...good, not great. 

Nice little Amiance but not too small as other reviewers indicate. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza place.  It's amazing how close it tastes to pizza in Firenze! Graci"}
{"text":"Went here recently with another couple. I had the pork cutlet entrée which I would rank as average. It was served with a side of salad which left me wanting. Some pasta or other side would have filled the dish out nicely. All of the others in the party had the pizza which got rave reviews. I will have to try that if we decide to return again. Overall I good meal though.

My only other criticism was that the wine was served in want I'd describe as a juice glass. If your patrons are spending $7+ on a glass of wine, please get some economical wine glasses. I felt like I was having juice with breakfast not wine with dinner."}
{"text":"Honestly it's something about the pizza that's very good.  I was very skeptical of this place because I'm always eating the American style pizza. Boy was I wrong. The pizza was very good and it just tasted authentic. Service could be a little slow but so can other restaurants. The Nutella calzone was delicious to top of the day. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Good service.  Menu difficult to read if you don't understand italian."}
{"text":"My brother used to live in Italy, and I visited him there a couple of times several years ago when I was less experienced with the world of food. Before going, some uncultured Americans told me (paraphrasing) \"pizza might come from Italy, but the pizza there is plain and terrible\". Americans are obviously used to the \"everythingbutthekitchensink\" pies that Pizza Hut and Papa John's have brainwashed us to think is good pizza. Sadly, I was a brainwashee and when I went to Napoli, I ignored their pizza. Blasphemy! I mean, for real?? What dummy goes to Napoli and doesn't have pizza? This dummy, apparently! The pizzas at Crostatas look exactly like they did in Napoli. So glad, because now I can make up for my sins.

I asked our server what the difference was between the regular margherita and margherita DOC. Was told that the DOC is made with buffalo mozzarella and was much creamier and smoother. Sold! Also tried the funghi and the alba pizzas. The margherita simply had San Marzano tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, basil and evoo. The funghi, same, but with shrooms minus the basil. Alba had capocollo ham, arugula, fried egg. Such deliciousness in the simplicity of the Neapolitan pizza.

For dessert, we opted for some spumoni and... get this... Nutella calzone. Whuuuut??? Yes!

This was a pizza only visit, but along with the other pizzas we didn't get to try yet, they also have very interesting entrees on their menu that are worth repeat visits to sample."}
{"text":"Amazing. Some of the best pizza I have ever had. So crispy and soft at the same time. Perfect. Service was good. Our waitress was very attentive. We called ahead and made a reservation because we had 8 people. The inside is really well decorated as well. Will definitely go again"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic, feels like your eating with family. Such a beautiful and clean restaurant. The staff is always very friendly and the prices are super reasonable for the high quality of their product. We visited Saturday evening with our 2 year old and all though every table was full, it was not loud or overwhelming. We had conversations with 2 of the tables near us and truly felt as if we were among friends. Their pizza is so delicious that we always order that, but I do plan to try the pasta soon as it is made in house. We enjoyed the crostini appetizer with olive oil, salsicca pizza, and the caprese pizza. We can't rave enough about the quality and authentic flavor!! Also - I want to add, they are closed on Sundays which I personally think is awesome!!"}
{"text":"It was my first visit to Crostatas, and I had a very enjoyable meal. The ravioli and meatballs was excellent. Our waitress, Vanessa was extremely nice and helpful. A great experience overall."}
{"text":"Oh boy. Crostata's makes the most delicious pizza that I've ever had in my life, without question.

I really don't even know where to start. I usually come to Crostata's with one other person, so we usually split one appetizer and one pizza and that's the perfect amount (although let's be real, I could eat some crazy amounts of this amazing pizza). For appetizers, the arancini is my absolute favorite - it's rich and creamy and crunchy and delicious in every way. I've also had the stuffed peppers which are great too, but I really can't not order the arancini - it's too good.

The pizza is perfection. Everything from the thin-but-not-too-thin crust to the amazing toppings are just.. perfect. My personal favorites are the caprese and the prosciutto with arugula. I've had the alba, and wasn't sure what to expect from pizza with egg on it.. but of course, it was delicious. Crostata's doesn't disappoint. The pizza takes a little bit of time to arrive, but it's totally worth the wait. 

I've tried a few different desserts here and they've all been pretty good, but the one that stands out in my mind is the lemon napoleon. I love lemon desserts and this was a great balance of tart and sweet. 

I love Crostata's."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza. Perfect crust-crisp and chewy, a little char and smoke. 
Appetizer of prosciutto, figs with gorgonzola & balsamic,  and grilled asparagus was delicious. 
I'm stopping in whenever I'm nearby. Do they serve breakfast?"}
{"text":"Best Italian for lunch on the east side of Cleveland.   Mista salad and pasta fagioli are my favorites."}
{"text":"I do not like to review restaurants without going more than once, but this place was so good I must share! I went here with my inlaws they gave me a bite of their pizza, I was so regretful that I did not order it!  It was so different but delicious.  It had maybe arugula and some dried Italian meat.  I am dying to go back and order it.  I ordered a sausage pizza which was great, the sausage was homemade but too safe of an order for a place with so much flavor.  We had the risotto balls as an appetizer and they were creamy and delicious.  They serve wine in juice glasses which is suppose to be how they do it in Italy, I wouldn't know.  Their salads looked awesome but did not get one....another regret! Until next time"}
{"text":"We went on a weeknight at around 5:30pm and were warmly greeted. The appetizer and the entrees came fast except for the artichoke. Our waitress did warn is that it would take 15 minutes to prepare.

It finally came when we were halfway done with dinner. And when my wife opened it and started digging in, it was frozen cold in the middle. We complained but they only offered to reheat it instead of taking it off the bill."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza, perfect salad with amazing hot breadsticks. Felt like I was in an out of the way restaurant in Italy. Will definitely come back when I am in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Trying to get them to name a salad I request all the time not on the menu. Arugula with Grilled Chicken. Help me out Montana! 

The Eaton: Arugula with Grilled Chicken"}
{"text":"Great pizza. The staff is always friendly even when super busy. Hard to get a seat during the weekend but the takeout is just as good when we eat at home. Never been disappointed and we get from here twice a month"}
{"text":"Another example of Yelpers coming through...

Decided to get out of the house on an incredibly cold day here in Tropical Cleveland (-20 wind chills) to visit Costatas.  Many of the reviews I read describe the restaurant well enough, so I'll just comment on our meal.

Apps
Arancini - highly regarded here on Yelp; they were solid
deep fried zucchini - very tasty

Pizzas
Margherita D.O.C. - excellent; the kids demolished it
Alba - the arugula was not overpowering, and any pizza with a fried egg is $$$
Salsiccia - there was A LOT of sausage on this one, and it had that perfect Italian sausage spiciness

Dessert: Tiramisu, Cannoli, Gelato.  All were enjoyed thoroughly!

Great service, although the pizzas were a tad slow to come out given the lack of customers, but a minor gripe.  We'll be back..."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great layout and a family friendly vibe.  It's great for large groups and big italian families.  They didn't even mind when my 2 year old cousin needed to walk around the restaurant with her sippy cup to keep from crying.  

The waitress was really nice and explained everything on the menu to us in detail.  She even went and asked the chef about some of the ingredients to avoid allergies.  I loved the authentic family style serving platters and the presentation was beautiful.  This is for sure a great place to take visitors or the family for a yummy night out."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Started a new job on the East side last week and made a point of stopping here on my way home (West side) after work.  Last time I was here was 4 years ago when I lived on the East side and we ate at Crostatas often. Then and now ranks as one of my top 4 favorite pizza restaurants in CLE.  It was just as good as I remembered.  Had the Quatro Formaggio and tried the Aroncini.   Both were excellent.  The Aroncini was much better than others I've tried elsewhere.  They've added to their menu and my next visit I'll definitely try the homemade cavetelli or ravioli.  You can add meatballs or sausage.  I can't say enough great things about Crostata's.  Get there, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment after reading all the glowing reviews. First let me say that the restaurant itself is very nice, clean and has friendly efficient service. 

The reason I traveled out of my way to eat here was for the wood fired Neapolitan style pizza my wife and I both love so much.  We both were very disappointed by the sub par pizza we were served. The outer crust was bone dry and of a cracker type of consistence. It may have been that the dough was old and had lost its moisture content but either way it was bad 

I do hold out the possibility that it was just a off day, but that day the pizza was just not good. As a side note we did have a appetizer \"fried risotto\"  which was very good but we traveled an hour to have their pizza."}
{"text":"For purveyors of the pizza , this palace of pie is particularly pleasing. 

Crostata's pizza is awesome.  If you go there and don't get their pizza, I don't want to know you. I love me some pizza, and this is the best in Cleveland.  They imported a specialty stove, which they have mastered.  I have several criterion for rating pizza, as described below.

1. Leopard spotting.  A good wood fired stove, used properly, gives the bottom of a crust spotting that looks like a leopard.  A little bit of leopard spotting enhances the flavor and texture of a crust;  it's more crisp and leaves less of a mess.  The bottom of one of these pizzas would satisfy fellow yelper Jenny C's insatiable love for leopard printed clothing and decor. 

3. Crust gauge.  The thinner the crust, the better. That means the more slices you can eat, with more toppings and flavor, without feeling like a beached whale after you're done. On the other hand, crust that is too thin results in a high tip sag factor (see factor 3 below).  Crostatas crust gauge successfully strikes this balance.

3.   Tip Sag . You know that disappointing feeling when you pick up a piece of pizza, and the tip of the pizza goes limp and toppings spill off?  That's due to a crust that's not cooked enough, or is too thin to support the toppings on it.   The crust here is on the thin side, but can be handled properly with one hand without the toppings spilling off the tip onto the plate.  That's because a good wood fired oven cooks the bottom of the pizza, making the bottom crispy which provides more tip support.  

Crostata's obviously knows how to make a good pizza.  I like the Fungi, or any of the Margharita pizzas they offer.  

They have other good stuff too.  I like the insalata mista, which you can split with another person before the pies come out.  Or don't get it, and get an extra pizza."}
{"text":"Omg sooooo good!!! That was the best cannoli I ever had! I wish I order two of them! The pizza what amazing too!"}
{"text":"I moved away 20 years ago and crave authentic, Italian food. I kept seeing posts on facebook about Crostatas and couldn't wait to try it next time I was in town! My daughter and I started with a caprese salad and fried zucchine. The salad was fresh, well seasoned and loved the splashes of sweet balsamic. The zucchine was crisply adorned with Panko breading and came with this to-die-for dipping sauce we were told was a blend of mayo, horseradish and evoo...yum! Next we enjoyed some cheese ravioli and cavatelli. The pasta was just like Grandma used to make and the sauce had just a hint of sweetness. Delizioso! We decided to take some of everything home, along with a sausage pizza to go so we could save room for dessert. Wow! It was tough to decide, but we went with the cannoli and vanilla bean gelato. See the food porn pictures I posted, as I know your mouth is already watering! And I was flattered when my daughter said the server, Montana, reminded her of me because she was so friendly! It was more than I would've normally spent on lunch, but we got a lot of food and it was so worth it! And by the way, I also heard our server remember someone's beverage of choice and they hadn't been in for months! I miss home. The only bad thing about sharing our experience is that I'm sure there'll be a wait next time!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! Our food was  phenomenal and the service was impeccable. Being in the food industry for years I appreciated our server (Sharon) taking the initiative to ensure that our dining experience was flawless. She definitely succeeded. From the 1st course to their desserts-save room for the tiramisu-Crostatas will not disappoint you."}
{"text":"Crostadas is excellent. The ambience is friendly and laid-back. The service was prompt and capable. The pizza we had was delish.

My wife and I shared a caramelized onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, and buffalo cheese. Excellent. The crust was definitely the highlight of the pizza, though it was almost overwhelmed by the flavorful toppings. (I love too many toppings, so that was fine by me.) The mushrooms also stood out. Most \"pizza mushrooms\" are fine, but bland. These 'shrooms were rich and full of almost concentrated mushroom flavor. One pizza fed us comfortably; half a pizza each was only a little more than we typically eat at home.

The water glasses were tiny, but our server kept mine topped off. (This matters to me.)

Finally, we rarely get dessert. I don't know why my wife decided that she wanted it that day, but I'm glad she did. They baked raspberries into their ricotta cheesecake and had a raspberry sauce that they poured on top. I'd never had ricotta cheesecake with berries before, and it was awesome. Even though the cheesecake itself wasn't quite up to North End (in Boston) standards, adding the fruit made it nearly so.

We never fight over who gets the larger half of the pizza or who gets more bites of dessert. For this meal, we did both. I did regret one thing about the meal; after we were back on the road, I realized that I hadn't tipped enough."}
{"text":"Loved it! Everything taste so fresh. The pizza taste exactly like it does in Italy and the desserts are to die for. I seriously couldn't stop eating. I will definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"Driving here may be confusing because it's surrounded by residential areas.  Every person we were at dinner with was like \"As I drove here I was thinking 'Are we eating at someone's house?'\" It's a little strange but the place itself has a homey feel so it's kind of fitting!

We went on a Friday night and it wasn't super packed but almost all the tables were filled. Our server was very nice and our food came out relatively quickly (for the amount that we got...).  We shared 3 appetizers which were all DELICIOUS.  Arancini are two GIANT fried risotto balls willed with meat and cheese.  They were nice and crispy on the outside.  The deep fried zucchini (probably my favorite appetizer) was hot and super crispy.  The stuffed hot peppers were also great; the sausage stuffing was bomb and the peppers had a nice kick to them.

Then we shared the Margherita and Alba pizzas and the cavatelli.  The crust on the pizzas here are no joke! They're on the thin side and had just the right amount of crispiness.  They put the toppings on there so it's a thin layer and not a heavy bulky thing on top and that way the pizza is easy to eat and light.  The cavatelli was also doughy and yummy.  Probably some of the best pizza I've had in Cleveland."}
{"text":"TOP NOTCH HONEST OLD WORLD ITALIAN FOOD! Excellent taste, fresh ingredients, and made dishes, friendly service, clean and well decorated interior. There really isn't a single bad thing I can say about this place, other than eat here as soon as you can!!! You just don't see a place like this outside of Italy. ~ KayZ"}
{"text":"In summary: It's good...but suffering from the Highland Hypes.

So I've heard people rave about this place been wanting to try it for awhile.  After testing some golf clubs at Golf Galaxy Crostatas seemed like the perfect place to wrap up our big suburban adventure.....  

What better way to wind down the evening than starting with a mommy's little helper?  The wine list was passable.  So I passed and went straight for the good stuff.  Crostatas has two types of whiskey: Dewars & Crown.   I don't Do-wars, so I ordered a Crown & Coke.  The pleasant waitress brought me the following items.  Separately:

1) A 8 oz glass filled with ice;
2) A black pint glass sized straw;
3) A 10 oz bottle of Coke;
4) A 1 oz shot glass filled with Crown.

So I poured #4 into #1 splashed in some #3 and stirred with #2.  The upside of this was that if you wanted another you only needed to reorder #4.  

This do-it-yourself mixology was like the fondue of drinking.  Like the Melting Pot it was kinda fun.  In a weird, I'm making my own drink at the table of a suburban pizza joint way.  (Please note, the very nice waitstaff repeatedly noted that they were not bartenders; So this is coming from the loving place.).

The pizza?  (Full disclosure, I'm a Geraci's kinda gal) Crostata's pizza was pretty good.  Mind-blowingly-life-altering-amazing pizza?  No.  

Our table ordered the Salsiccia (basically sausage) and a Margherita (basically cheese).  I tried both and the crust was far and away the standout of both pizzas.  Wood fired pizza ovens do magical things.  This is a proven fact.  I read it on Wikipedia.  The sauce was not too bold, but was flavorful and was a nice pairing with the rustic style crust.  The toppings were clearly quality, but, for my money, the sausage at Geraci's is better. 

So after trying Crostata's I understand why people are raving.  I'm just not one of them.  And that's OK.  I also think The Beatles are overrated."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here today. I ate at another joint which claims to offer pizza di Napoli. It doesn't compare. Instead of writing bad reviews about those \"other places\", I decided to impart my 7 years worth of dining experience at crostatas to you. 

A little bit of background: my SO was born in Rome, Italy. My father in law and the whole family is from Napoli, Italy. We've been given plenty lectures on what makes a real authentic Neapolitan pizza. And roman cuisine in general.

I saw a few previous not-so-happy yelp reviews. Let me tell you. Here's what to order for two people:

For your protein and vegetable, get either
1. INSALATA BISTECCA: salty & sour, lean
it's a big plate, with lots of arugula, well seasoned with lemon and salt. The beef is tender, very reasonable portion for two, not greasy at all. Occasionally this dish would come out a bit too salty for me. If you are sensitive to salt, tell your server to reduce salt.

OR
2. COSTOLETTA di MAIALE: meaty, sweet, substantial
Organically, locally raised hogs for your dining pleasure. 2 or 3 pieces thinly pounded, very tender pork chops. Because it's breaded, the calories will be higher than the bistecca. I used to tell them to NOT to bread my pork chops, but honestly, the breaded version goes well with the romaine and balsamic dressing. They use quality balsamic vinegar. It's sweet not sour at all. Lots of romaine. 

For your carbohydrate and dairy, get
MARGHERITTA D.O.C: milky, sweet, chewy yet crispy. Like a dream. You won't want it to stop.

this is the default flavor of Neapolitan pizza. When you go to a new pizzeria, you want to see whether they know what they're doing, order this flavor. We've tried all flavors on the menu. In the end we always go back to doc.

At crostatas, the cheese has a good balance with the tomato sauce. I want to describe it as \"milky yet sweet\". The reason: To be a certified Neapolitan pizza place, you must adhere to strict ingredient requirements. These two ingredients are most popular / beloved by most chefs, which is what crostatas used in margheritta doc:

A. San Marzano Tomatoes: a type of plum tomato that's sweet and low in acidity (compared to Roma tomato for example). If you use an acidic tomato sauce, your pizza will taste acidic...then you'll try to compensate with sugar...hence some not-so-great margheritta pizza you've had in the past.

B. Mozzarella Di Bufala: it's trademarked. The milk must come from buffalo raised in Campana region. Buffalo milk has twice as much fat as cow milk. Hence the intense milky flavor.

The dough is chewy, yet the crust is crispy. pizza here gives me an impression that it must come from some \"thousand-years mother dough\". The other places's dough feels a bit \"juvenile\", portion not as substantial yet more expensive.

You don't need 100 ingredients as toppings for it to be a good pizza. Simple but good ingredients on the right dough, so classy, so warm, so good.

OR

Pesto
Pesto with shrimp

Dessert: spumoni or tiramisu. Get an espresso. Helps with digestion. So claimed the Italians.

Order the above dishes. You will want to give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I never go out for Italian food unless it's truly Italian. Well my friends, this is truly Italian food...and I can vouch for it being that I recently spent almost 2 weeks eating myself silly through Italy with my husband. 

The pizzas are made in a pizza oven and are very tasty. Crispy, yet chewy thin crust with a homemade tomato sauce made from San Marzano tomatoes (we asked) and fresh mozarella cheese. What could be better?

The salads are huge (big enough for 2 and then some) and the few pastas on their menu are all homemade- watch them roll it in the kitchen behind the register. The ravioli is to die for amazing. Meatballs are very good as well, and not as rich as I expected. 

If you are searching for some true Italian food, check this place out. You'll be happy you did. Just remember you are still in Cleveland (not Italy) and bring a coat it's chilly in there...brrr!"}
{"text":"Liked this place very much. The food was delicious, the prices reasonable, and the service very good. The fried zucchini appetizer was probably the best I've ever had. Things came from the kitchen astonishingly hot. We had a fish special, the steak on arugula, and a pizza. All the dishes were very good. The pizza, however was special. Stretched too thin for my taste, but around the outer circumference where it had a little more substance it was superb, near perfection in flavor, texture, and tooth. I'd love to make dough so good!

I'd love to have a chance to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"Here in Cleveland, WOW!  I recommended this restaurant. Every Food I ate was excellent."}
{"text":"Crostatas is a full experience of taste and flavor from the start to the end.  Delicious appetizers with special remark for the Arancini, wood-oven traditional Italian pizzas and several dessert choices as tasty as the rest (try the lemon Napoleon for instance).

Try Crostatas once and you will become a fan!"}
{"text":"Great service and excellent Italian food. The staff was very attentive and our waitress kalley went above and beyond especially when it came to our little one. We will definitely be returning for more!"}
{"text":"As an avid explorer of new restaurants, every now and then I come across a certain type of experience that serves as a wake-up call. One so memorable, it leaves a lasting impression upon me that borders upon a life-altering type experience. My latest life-altering foodie experience took place in a suburban pizza joint called Crostata's Pizzeria in Highland Heights. 

Crostata's has been open for less than 2 years now and apparently it's still one of the best kept secrets in town as each time I've visited, the place has been practically empty. It's most likely due to the bad location and lack of advertising, but hopefully word of mouth and glowing reviews as seen here on Yelp can help spread the word and keep this place alive.

The corner of Bishop and Highland Road used to be the location to an Arabica Coffee house. Today you'll find an old world style Pizzeria with charming Neapolitan architecture, complete with a terracotta roof. Inside it's more of the same. Authentic rustic Italy is well pronounced, including the giant wood-fired pizza oven, said to fire pizzas at 900°F, cooking them in just 90 seconds flat! 

As for the menu, it stays focused on what they do best: soups, salads and pizzas, with a few choice appetizers. On our latest visit, we sampled the Arancini which were risotto balls stuffed with meat ragu, parmigiana and marinara. A superb way to start the meal.

The menu features 13 different pizzas, 10 of them meatless. Don't even try and ask for pepperoni either. First of all, Pepperoni isn't authentic to Neapolitan pizzas. Secondly, this is not an a-la-carte pizza establishment. The pizzas to choose from are already thought out and go by names such as Quattro Stagoni, Margherita and Salsiccia. (Refer to the menu for descriptions). 

The pizza we ordered was titled: the Alba, which consisted of San Marzano tomatoes, capicola, arugula, fresh egg, Grana Padana and EVOO. While I appreciated the crust and fresh ingredients, I was a little less than thrilled with the strong flavor of the arugula. But that was my fault. I'm not a huge arugula guy and I overlooked it because I was sold on the fresh egg the pizza came topped with. If you like arugula, this pie might be for you. If not, you have 12 other wonderful creations to chose from.

When asked to see the dessert menu, we declined and said instead of dessert, we'd like to order another pizza instead! This time, we ordered the Margherita D.O.C., topped with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella di bufala, basil and EVOO. Simple, but superior to all other pizzas I've ever had. The dough was chewy, yet firm enough to hold the toppings. The crust, with just enough char from the wood fire. The buffalo mozzarella, creamy with hints of almond. The tomatoes and basil, fresh and arranged in a minimalist kind of way to not weigh down the pizza and to ensure everything was heated just right. 

Those used to topping crazed pizzas such as \"Supreme\" and \"Meat Lover\" styles might get the feeling they were ripped off with the lack of toppings here until they realize less really is more. Each ingredient is so fresh and the flavors so pronounced, it's a blessing no one topping dominates the rest of the pizza. Each ingredient is to be celebrated and the ratio Crostata's uses almost seems like a science. 

I look forward to sharing this relatively unknown gem with other family/friends in the near future. This place deserves success and I hope it receives the recognition it most certainly deserves. If only Crostata's was located in a better location such as Rocky River, Ohio City or Tremont, there would be no more discussion about Geraci's, Mama Santa's or Angelo's. This would be the undisputed king of pie in this city and not even by a close margin either."}
{"text":"Small family house, a piece of Italy in Highland Hts.

Delicious  thin, crunch and balanced pizza."}
{"text":"We took my husband's dad out for his 76th birthday here. Our waitress was Montana. Our 14 year old daughter gave her grandfather a bag of Lay's potato chips since he eats tons of them. (He got lots of other gifts too.) Our waitress noticed the chips and said, \"Oh you got laid.\" Our daughter was really embarrassed and my husband and I were stunned. The only bright side was that my father in law doesn't hear all that well and missed the comment.  That was the single most inappropriate thing a waitress has ever said in front of me.

I'd add that we sat there with empty drinks for a long time before having to call over Montana to get refills. We also had so many empty plates on our table at one point that since we had no room we stacked a couple on an empty chair to make room.  Their A/C wasn't working that night and people were complaining but what I can say is that there are things that can be helped and some that are beyond your control. The A/C was beyond their control. The service issue was not.

We'd planned to bring in a friend's daughter soon when she is training at Progressive. We will not be doing that now. Their food is quite good but that experience was really something I will not soon forget.

btw I didn't plan to post this here because it wasn't a food issue but I contacted them privately with no response so they either don't care or they don't read their messages."}
{"text":"In my quest for the best stone oven pizza in northeast Ohio I think I have found it. Unbelievable dough, homemade sausage and the perfect blend of tomatoes and mozzarella cheese baked to perfection. The mista salad was perfect and not to mention the fresh cannoli made on site. Can't wait to go back and highly recommend to all. This is REAL Italian."}
{"text":"First, some background... I was born and raised in New York City and think that NY pizza is the best in the world. Almost nothing in Cleveland comes close. 

Given that, Crostats is very good. And, having also visited Italy, I would say their pizza is more like what you would get in Italy than you get in the US. 

The food is all consistently good to excellent and very high quality. The Antipasto Misto is very nice, though I wouldn't say it was the best in Cleveland. The Cesar salad is very nice. The bread sticks that come with it are great. We have tried several of the pizzas and they are all very nice. And make sure you save room for dessert - they make all their own desserts and the Napoleon Limone is fantastic, enough to make you cry with joy. 

A couple of downsides. My wife and I have been several times; they don't take reservations and some times the wait is long. The wait staff is nice, but I think is sometimes a little short staffed and thus a little inattentive. The biggest downside (the reason I don't go there more often) is that it is I think very pricey. I realize this isn't a neighborhood pizza place, but the last time we were there: one antipasto, one salad we split, two pizzas, two glasses of wine, and one dessert with two coffees, and it was around $80."}
{"text":"This is a Cute family restaurant, very friendly wait staff, and the portion size for the salad and soup were huge! The salad had the perfect amount of dressing and toppings which goes a long way for first impressions. The Handmade cavatelli were perfect and the meatballs were excellent as well. We are giving this restaurant only 4 stars though because for an Italian restaurant a major part of any review is the house red sauce - which in this case had a wonderful taste but was a tad too watery in consistency and probably only needs a bit thicker of a base. This made Our cavatelli sit in a watery sauce bed rather than be coated. That being said, we had a great meal and We will definitely come back for more soon!"}
{"text":"my husband and i had dinner their last night, and it was great.. We tried a little of everything from pizza to several app, and everything was amazing so glad we found this little gem. Bravo."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. We ordered Italian wedding soup--superb, Italian sausage sandwich, and a sausage pizza , all delicious!   Looking forward to returning soon with friends."}
{"text":"Excellent. Tasty. Have never had a bad meal or bad service. The Napoleon Limone is a delicious dessert."}
{"text":"Didn't expect anything special as we pulled into an empty parking lot around noon, but were pleasantly surprised as we walked into this fairly unassuming place. The host was welcoming and the ambiance was decent, but all of that didn't matter once the food started coming out. 

I live in Chicago and while we have great pizza, I must say the crust on the pizza here is absolutely perfect. We had a simple Margarita pizza as an appetizer and meatballs and ravioli for lunch. The sauce on the pizza was robust and thick and tasted fresh. I poured some of the olive oil they use on the pizza and the whole thing just popped with flavor. The large ravioli were cooked perfectly with a bite to them and tasted like the pasta was made to order. They served the meatballs in the same marinara sauce and was packing a fragrant blend of fresh herbs. I'm here on a work trip and we didn't talk shop throughout our lunch and the following day we ordered 4 pizzas and picked it up for the local guys here. We were all very impressed

This place is a gem and I highly recommend the food here!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Lovely ambiance. Amazing pizza and appetizers. Best tiramisu in all of Cleveland. (Maybe the entire state!) I've never had a bad experience there. Servers are nice. Food is great."}
{"text":"When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie ... That's crostatas. This is great pizza and food and service. All around great place to eat."}
{"text":"Fantastic. I've had their chicken sandwich, pizzas and wedding soup. Some of the best authentic Italian food on this side of Cleveland. The location is beautiful and the staff is great. Make sure you ask for bread and oil too!

If you are here during lunch you might just be lucky enough to enjoy the workers prepping ingredients... Nothing better than the smell of fresh basil to make you want to come back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and panini. Had the Nutella calzone for dessert... It was Awesome!
Everything was homemade and worth every dollar."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, and creative choices make this place a winner.

My friends loved the large Chicken Caesar Salad. I like the pizzas.

Service can be slightly slow - usually (and strangely) after the food is delivered.

Tea is not good and tastes like it's off a gun even though it's brewed."}
{"text":"Great brick oven pizza. Service was not so great. One server waiting on the entire restaurant. We got waters and then waited for an exceptionally long time just to put in our order. Luckily the food did not take too long to make. Food was great but then had to wait again to order dessert (Nutella Calzone = phenomenal!). She did keep my water full though! And she did apologize for the service. You would think that the owner would have cared enough to help the server out, but he was just kind of hanging out. I would come back for the food, but probably just for take-out."}
{"text":"After trying a different pizza place earlier in the day at a restaurant in Little Italy and being very disappointed, I was a bit suspicious about Cleveland's pizza offerings.  Reluctantly, I took a chance and ordered the Classico as well as a Caesar salad.  The service was fast, friendly, and on-point.  The food was amazing.  I would recommend this place to any pizza snob out there."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Italian food! Fresh ingredients prepared right then and there make crostatas worth every penny. Homemade pasta, thin crust Italian style pizza and a host of delicious locally sourced meats and vegetables. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Went for a weekday lunch with my mom - our recap:

5 stars - staff: very friendly, and I loved that almost everyone I saw working were women!

4.5 stars - price: overall very reasonable pricing

4 stars - food: mom ordered a panini and I opted for the Classico pizza.  The pizza had delicious toppings, but I found the crust to be a bit soggy.  It was a bit better when I reheated leftovers in the oven the next day.  It is a solid pizza choice, but not legendary must-eat pizza, as other reviews might suggest.

2 stars - ambiance: the interior was dated, furniture was old, and there was no outdoor seating (sad especially since it was a warm summer day)"}
{"text":"Great pizza place on the east side for folks searching for a rustic spin on ZA using fresh, vibrant, delicious toppings on a thin, perfectly baked crust.   I personally have never had pizza quite like this but left Crostata's a happy man with a full belly.  Food comes fast and exactly as ordered. 

We started with the Antipasto Misto for $12, what a platter this is!  Lots of meats, cheeses, and olives which were not only tasty but properly presented, kind of kicking myself for not taking a picture with my phone and uploading.  The platter beat out La Dolce Vita in Little Italy IMO.  

Our pizza for the night was called Quattro Stagoni for $15.50.  This pizza consisted of roasted red peppers, mushrooms, artichokes, basil, marinara, and Italian sausage. We both really enjoyed this pizza.  The crust is fantastic and goes perfectly with the toppings.  Not too cheesy, not too saucy, definitely a healthy but delicious spin on pizza.  If you are expecting a big, greasy, topping overload kind of pizza (Chi-town style), then coming here may not be for you.   Check out their website for great pictures of the pizza.  

At Crostata's you pay for the ingredients and it really shows with the final product.  This place is definitely not for everyone and it might leave some people a little 'empty' if you expect to get 'more for your money' but for all you other foodies out there that just want a nice night out with friends or family without having to deal with the Pizza Hut crowd, Crostata's is perfect.  I'd even say it has a date type atmosphere.

There is more seating then it appears from the outside.  Beer, wine, and cocktails are available.  I opted for a glass of red for $6.50 and it fit the bill perfectly with the food we ordered.  I was even picking at the Antipasto platter all day Sunday, stayed just fine in the fridge.  I'm planning on taking down the rest of the pizza for today's lunch."}
{"text":"It's a nice Italian restaurant. The pizza is very good. It has a very nice atmosphere. It's a little pricey for dining weekly. The cannoli is out of the world and is a must for your visit"}
{"text":"Super delicious and one of the best pizzas and sides ever! The staff is wonderful and the service is beyond great!! I'll always go back for a visit and some good food :)"}
{"text":"We just left Crostata's without even eating. Not one person greeted us even though the hostess, a server and man seating the guests were standing right in front of us. There was a waiting list and after standing in front of these three employees for 5 minutes (while the hostess took phone orders and texted on her cell phone) I asked \"can you take our name down\"? We sat for 20 minutes and then left. It was a bizarre experience and we will not return."}
{"text":"Best authentic tasting brick oven pizza in the area hands down. Good service and great food. It's a little small, but seems to manage well."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, you can tell the ingredients are fresh and premium. We had the fresh house made pasta, sauce was amazing and flavorful. The pizza had their homemade sausage which was great. The desserts, cannoli and tiramisu, were great too! The staff was friendly and did a great job. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza near Cleveland, hands down. Get the Margherita DOC with Bufala mozzarella, and you will agree. Only downsides - reservations with parties of 7 or more, and they can't make too many pizzas at once. If you do come with a big group, don't be shy about eating while others wait for their pizza, or yours will be cold by the time theirs come out."}
{"text":"The worst pizza I have ever had, and I usually say there is \"no bad pizza, just better pizza\". The sauce had NO flavor at all it was just plain diced tomatoes and the toppings were scarce.  To ad insult to injury, they wanted to call this \"gourmet\" and overcharge for a tasteless pizza.  Don't waste your money- I would rather eat cardboard Little Caesar's."}
{"text":"I was so impressed by the service I got at Crostatas. And the food was amazing. The best Italian food I've ever had! Overall a deliciously wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing 4 stars! A Little Italy restaurant in Highland Heights. If you go, you must get a pizza - what they are known for and the arancini balls appetizer. 

However, our service was horrible. We had a waitress that must have been new... she took our plates before we were done eating and talked over us when we were ordering. We were ready to order and she would not stop talking listing all of the specials for the day. We debated even leaving a tip. She kept checking up on us too much throughout our lunch and did not have a good presence."}
{"text":"I treated myself to a 100 mile round trip drive to sample Crostatas' Neapolitan pizza  after getting out of hospital today.  I ordered a MARGHERITA D.O.C. with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella di bufala, basil and EVOO that was baked in their artisan constructed wood fired oven.  

It was outstanding!  The crust tapered from the subtle, soft and chewy center to a crisp and flavorful cornice made from Caputo 00 flour.  The tomatoes were bright, full bodied, and definitely San Marzano's.  The mozarella, di bufala, was smooth as silk, with a sweet overtone.  I sampled the Parmesan in the shaker, and it was definitely freshly grated.

I just ordered a coffee, and when a Caffè Americano arrived I was pleasantly surprised.  It was excellent also, by the way, as was the waite staff.  I also appreciated my conversation with Angelo at the counter as he described the construction of their prized oven and how long it took to \"temper\".

You will not be disappointed by Crostatas if my experience with the Margherita DOC was any indication!

They also sell the very hard to get Caputo 00 flour for the home pizza makers."}
{"text":"Amazing. A must try. Pizza is as good as the pizza I had in Venice, maybe better. 

Wish the arancini was available in a vegetarian version. Bums me out that the meat isn't just in the sauce and marinara could be subbed out. 

The lemon dessert is to die for."}
{"text":"Great lunch. Started with the Caesar salad. Big enough for two. Best croutons ever and perfectly dressed. Sausage pizza was amazing. Great crust and the sausage was fresh and tasty. Cooked to perfection. 

Service was great. Nice place to bring kids. Will be back."}
{"text":"Mama Mia, this is good pizza.

My foodie friend and I went on a search for good pizza. After searching a few yelp sites, he suggested Crostatas. \"OK!\" I said. And off we drove to Crostatas.

I'm not a huge pizza fan (although I swear by Chicago's Lou Malnati's pizza), but after having Cleveland's pizza, consisting of Pizzabogo, Dewey's, Donato's, Bar Cento, and Angelo's (which is probably the best out of all them...minus this place!), I really wanted to find some good pizza.

And boy, am I glad we stopped here. We ordered the Alba pizza- tomatoes, capicola,grana pandana, EVOO, egg and arugula. Oh, it was amazing. Crispy yet chewy, said my friend. It was sooo good- so flavorful, on this thin crispy crust, where the egg was perfectly a medium over easy....Mmmmmm. Everything about it was great.

Service was great too. I got a little glass diet coke bottle and was confused about it...since I've only seen the plastic ones. When inquiring about it, the waitress stated that the owner only wanted to show true \"Italian\" things, like serving the pop in glass bottles, cooking the pizza in a stone oven, and so on.

So worth it. Definitely stop here. Mmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"I love wood-fired pizza because I am a self-proclaimed pizza snob from NY, so I always have unfair comparisons. Wood fired italian pizzas are a different style that I always love. This place is really cute inside and out, and everything sounded awesome. I ordered a sausage pizza and then another one I added chicken to. Unfortunately they forgot to add the chicken to my pizza, which was disappointing. I waited 30 mins to get home and eat so the pizza had lost its crunch and was barely warm- totally not their fault because the flavor was there. I would imagine fresh, it would be 4 stars easily. Definitely willing to try them out again."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped by because we saw it featured on New Day Cleveland.  We are super glad we did.  She had the homemade cavatelli with meatballs. She said it was the best ever.  I had the one of the specials, the 28oz Steak. Omg both of us had great food and service.
The we had the homemade desert. 
It was very good and light it was the Napoleon Limone."}
{"text":"Everyone in Cleveland or visiting Cleveland needs to try this pizza. I had it for a second time and was blown away. Great pizza. Everything about it is great."}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Wow!  Amazing food!  We honeymooned in Italy for two weeks and this flooded our hearts and bellys with Almalfi and Firenzi deliciousness.  I highly recommend.  Our server Adrienne was so good and accommodating.  Delicious. I am so glad we came here and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza!  Real iltaian pizza. Ingredients fresh n simple. If you think about going some else. JUST 4 GET ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"While I've never been to Naples I have had authentic stone oven pizza in the Mediterranean, and this place is better than most. I wouldn't waste my time with anything other than pizza though."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza in Cleveland. Anyone who gives it less than 5 stars needs to get out of cleveland more because this place is the ahizzle"}
{"text":"This place clearly tries to serve very authentic Italian food. But I don't think they succeed in everything. My experience from traveling in Italy a few times is you always come out completely full out of a restaurant. This isn't the case with Crostatas. I went with my husband and we ordered 2 dishes, which is what we normally get when we go out. We actually went to get more food after we left the place. The portions were small and didn't have much to them.
I did enjoy the pizza, it had the authentic thin crust and good cheese but it was more of an appetizer portion rather than an entree size pizza.
I would recommend this place if you want to try some good Italian food but be prepared to either order a lot (and they're not cheap!) or don't go on a completely empty stomach."}
{"text":"This place serves my favorite pizza in Northeast Ohio. A heavenly treat. Their dinner salad is also to die for. And the service is attentive and friendly. No hesitation: five stars for this place."}
{"text":"I taste of Italy in Highland Hts., Ohio. This is a small, quaint, Italian eatery with an authentic feel and taste. I have only dined  here twice. Each time was amazing. They are known for their thin crust pizzas, of which they have many unique varieties to choose from.  Tonight is feel plain, margarita pizza with fresh basil sprinkled on top. I also decided to add in a side of the grilled eggplant. 

Both items were awesome. This is a great local authentic Italian restaurant that is actually family run. Some of the staff is from Italy. It's a very good local hidden gem. I highly recommended for simple, tasty, authentic Italian food."}
