{"text":"Hands down THE BEST BUTTER CHICKEN in the GTA!!!I took a friend here for a birthday dinner and we where quite impressed. Friendly staff, good service and most importantly the food is as authentic as it gets."}
{"text":"Potions are very small with the high teen$ price per dish. You barely can find any meat in the curry dishes. We ordered the whole chicken tandoori but more like a 1/2 chicken on the plate and I don't see any white meat. Even with Groupon it's still not worth to try it."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic especially the the tandoori lobster risotto and the tandoori chicken. I have eaten around the world and this is some of the best Indian food I have had. You can tell it was made from scratch. The ambience in restaurant is nice. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"(3.5 stars) 

Ordered takeout from this restaurant with my Groupon Deal. The restaurant is kind of tucked away in the strip plaza next to Vaughan Mills and had to circle a couple times to find it. 

I order 3 entrees including butter chicken, 1/2 tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala. All came with a piece of naan. The naan was little too thick compared to others. The entrees were tasty and are made fresh to order. However, the portions were rather small, especially for the price that is charged for each dish ($14-$16). Other than that, I'm quite happy with the service and the food."}
{"text":"Really delicious Indian food. We had butter chicken and goat curry. All tasted unique and home made. The place is tiny with a simple decor. The staff very welcoming. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best Indian place by far. Great pricing, nice atmosphere and fantastic customer service. We've been there few times and will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after purchasing a Groupon - $22 for $40 worth of food. The place is small, with around 12 tables in the establishment. The decor was cool, with photos of the london tube signs. 

We were quickly seated since there was only 1 other table aside from ourselves. The first thing when we sat down was a piece of hair on the napkin with our cutlery. GROSS. We were then given menus - which looked like take out menus (maybe because its a new restaurant). They had a couple lunch specials priced from $9-$12 bucks which seemed okay. We decided to order from the regular menu to get our monies worth. 

We ordered butter chicken with naan - $12, goat curry $12, with a mango lassi (price unknown because it wasnt on the menu - but when we got the bill it was $7! Are you kidding me? Thats one pricey lassi...) We intially ordered 2, but thank goodness the server only heard us say 1 lassi. 

Portion sizes were quite small. The goat curry tasted decent, but the butter chicken was a tad sweet. The mango lassi basically tasted like mango yogurt. The naan bread was good.

Overall, without the groupon, this place was not worth it. You'd get so much more value at an indian buffet."}
{"text":"Authentic and amazing tasty indian food.  I don't think I have had better indian food in Toronto.  The butter chicken and goat curry are fantastic.  The restaurant is nice and clean.  I hope to be there again soon."}
{"text":"We used a Groupon for a dine in $23 for $40 worth of food. We ordered a kebab roll appetizer, goa chicken curry and daal batti entrees. 
The appetizer came with the entrees, not earlier. The kebab roll was good, but it went downhill from there. The daal batti was horribly dry and tasteless and I found a stone chip in the daal. They served only one plate of the garden salad although there should have been 3 plates of that. The Goa chicken curry was okay but the portion size was super small for a $16 entrée. The butter naans accompanying the entrées had literally 3 drops of butter on them.
I would not recommend this restaurant even with the Groupon let alone at regular price. Stay away, but I don't need to tell you that -- the restaurant barely had any customers while we were there on a Friday evening."}
{"text":"It's an amazing experience! The restaurant is definitely underrated. Everything we had was fresh and made to order. Delicious and generous portions ."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal food. Authentic spices and herbs make the food fresh and full of flavour. An excellent choice is the goa chicken (green curry, coconut, mint and coriander with chicken). Highly recommend this place for a good experience with Indian food and great service."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal!  Dropped in an hour before close on a Sunday, and we had a great meal that completely hit the spot.  The waiter was very prompt and polite and our food came out quickly!

Had the goat curry and the chennai chicken with rice and naan-  both dishes were perfect. 

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family because we had a Groupon deal. We ordered a few dishes: the tandoori sampler, chicken 65, lobster curry, kadhai chicken, chicken korma and mutton biryani. Let me first start off by saying these dishes were way overpriced for the amount of food you were getting. The tandoori sampler was $29 and were only given paneer, chicken and kababs (not that many and some pieces were cold). I have been to other establishments where I've bought a tandoori sampler for $18 with more variety (even included fish!). Overall the food tasted good but it definitely lacked heat. 

The bill totaled to $135 ($55 with Groupon deal, not including tip). I would not come back here again and I do not recommend this restaurant to others, especially because there are so many Indian restaurants available around the GTA that have better prices and food.

{"text":"Came here for a groupon deal.  Had trouble finding the place.  It is located south of rutherford but on the north west section of vaughan mills.

Waiters are very polite and friendly.  We ordered the $20 lamb korma with butter naan and the all new jumbo tiger prawn dish with butter naan for $20 (which is not on their menus because it's a new dish).

The lamb dish tasted great, but lacking in quantity of meat.  For $20, everyone expects a nice portion size!  Most people will not return to this restaurant because of this little portion size.  I found about 7-8 little bite sized cubes of meat in the dish.  Sauce was fantastic and the meat quality was very good.  The lamb was tender and moist.

The jumbo tiger prawn dish is 11/10.  The sauce was fantastic.  The vegetables that came with the dish was generous and fresh.  Green peppers, broccoli, mushrooms, sundried tomato, onions, garlic, spices...  Mmmm yummy.  I found 5 huge tiger prawns inside the dish each one cooked perfectly.  This is the BEST shrimp dish i have ever had in an indian restaurant.  Highly recommended and i would come back and eat at this restaurant just for this dish!

The butter Naan bread arrived hot and fresh but i could hardly see any butter on the naan.

Overall we enjoyed our food and would return again for that shrimp dish!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night, about an hour and a bit before they closed. The restaurant was empty when my friend and I arrived. But once we sat two other groups arrived shortly. We were greeted right away and the server was very polite and recommended some entrees and drinks (try the Mango beer. It's different but delicious!). We came with a Groupon and I had called the server in advance to discuss the terms and he was very helpful. Reservation was easy.

I don't eat Indian food that often but the food here was really delicious. The food did not taste or look like it was made in a hurry or half-assed because it was an hour before closing. Highly recommend the Goa Chicken Curry with basmati rice. Wish the entree portions were bigger. For dessert I had the pistachio ice cream, again it was delicious. Will be coming back here again and recommending this restaurant to friends and family.

They are located in the plaza next to Vaughan Mills mall, next to Miami Fades barber."}
{"text":"Small sized restaurant. 
Ordered a lamb dish and shrimp curry. Flavour was good. The shrimps were very small. Size of a penny. 

Small size portions that do not equate to the price on menu. Was surprised. 

Naan and roti are crispy rather than fluffy. 

Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I have been here several times since they opened about one year ago. I have allergies to gluten and lactose, but, Colaba has been able accommodate my needs and guided me to items on their menu that were safe for me. My kids love the food here too including their vegetarian dishes.  

I have been to several restaurants in the GTA that one might classify in similar ethnic category, however, Colaba stands apart by way of delivering consistently high quality ethnic and fusion dishes. Unlike most of their competition, Colaba prepares each dish to order, no hot tables here. This takes a few extra minutes to prepare, but, the result is well worth it. 

In addition to an eclectic menu, very noticeable are the fresh herbs that are incorporated into the dishes, creating an enjoyable vibrant taste and aroma with lively texture. Colaba's dishes are less oily than their counterparts, so for me, the dishes are lighter, brighter, more interesting and easier to digest.  Colaba has also been good to adjust the heat of their dishes to suit my family members differing preferences of spice levels. 

This cozy family run restaurant is easily accessible at the outside central plaza north of Vaughn Mills mall, just south of Rutherford. The family and staff are caring, genuine and are a welcome option for those of us that prefer delicious, freshly prepared foods."}
{"text":"Overpriced and for the price the food is also not good. Ordered a chicken korma and being from indian background, i can make much better korma at home."}
{"text":"This restaurant is kind of hidden away in the Vaughan mills plaza.. The both times we went there it was pretty empty though a few people came in for takeout. 
The first time we went there we had ordered an appetizer plate called chicken 65. It was really good and definitely hit the spot. 
The second time we went there especially for the chicken 65 and when we ordered it we got a completely different plate. The chicken was not at all spicy and tasted of poor quality.. 
It seems like a family owned business with only one waitress who is very nice but we weren't served any water until the end and our order wasn't taken until I had gotten up to ask if she was ready to take our order. 
Colaba is not an indian restaurant I would recommend."}
{"text":"In sum: this place totally ripped me off. Tiny portion sizes and overpriced.

I really felt like Indian food so ordered Butter chicken and Tikki Nasal for pick up, plus basmati rice and a side of okra. The bill came to $50.

When I got the food home and opened it up the container was more than half empty. I didn't even get 1 chicken breast worth of meat in either dish. It was a complete rip off. I ended up eating both meals (my wife didn't like it and made something else) then I made eggs for dinner cause I was still hungry. The rice went uneaten.

Absolutely terrible.

What's worse is that they gave me a brochure that said 10% off with cash on pick up. I paid cash and they didn't give me the discount. Now that really pissed me off."}
{"text":"Fresh, high quality ingredients served in  traditional recipes. The menu even includes some of the famous Indian street food that is extremely hard to find in the GTA. Such a gem of a restraint tucked away in a busy shopping plaza. But as all good things in life are, they come in many shapes and sizes and are normally not the easiest or most obvious choice."}
{"text":"Amazing meal! We had the butter chicken, samosas, veggie pakora and garlic naan. It was fresh and delicious. Waiter was great, very attentive and nice. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"There aren't many Indian restaurants in the area, so Colaba Cuisine is a pleasant addition to the area. We came here for dinner on a Friday. The restaurant was small and cozy. The decor was nice, on one side were photos from India and the other were what looked like London Tube signs.

There were lots of choices on the menu, and almost all of the dishes come with a \"salad\" and rice or naan bread. The Colaba Masala Fish, for instance, does not come with naan. We ordered the butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, and the goa beach fish. We received a single dish of salad, which consisted of raw vegetables: bean sprout heads, some cabbage, tomatoes, and carrots. I didn't care for the salad much, and we were only given one even though there were 3 of us. The naan bread was really good, and so were each of the dishes. The chicken tikka masala was spicy even though we asked for mild, though I did like the spiciness of it. It was odd to see the fish with a green exterior, but it was definitely tasty as was the gravy that it was served in.

Overall I thought the food was very good. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"It was almost 9pm and restaurant closes at 10. We were craving for Indian food. It's next to Vaughan Mills. We looked in the window and it looked old and only a couple seated in one corner. Eventually we decided to try the place. It's quite small and shocked to see their prices are way too high compared to most Indian restaurants. Prices are even higher than Host and nearby fine restaurants. We ordered four dishes. Chicken korma, goa fish curry (served in square dish with 4 pieces of fish and filled with sauce) goat curry and butter chicken. Garlic nan are flaky and crispy which I find it different from other places.  We don't mind paying the price for delicious dishes but when the food came in small square bowls filled with sauce and less meat - that ruined my expectations on this restaurant.  Will pass this place."}
