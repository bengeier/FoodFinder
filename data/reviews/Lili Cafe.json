{"text":"I've only been in Pittsburgh for a week, so I don't want to jump the gun by declaring Lili my favorite coffee shop in Pittsburgh. But considering I've been here maybe half a dozen times already, it's certainly my most-visited. For me, this place is pretty close to perfect.

Pros:
1. Delicious, inexpensive (of course, I'm coming from Chicago and New York, so my idea of inexpensive is a little skewed) drinks. I've had a couple of iced lattes that were really spot on at $2.75
2. Satisfying chai that tastes a little bit different from your standard Oregon Chai concentrate
3. Green Manalsihi Smoothie--all sorts of fruit and spinach and juice, blended to a gorgeous green. Again, reasonable at $3.75
4. $1 day old pastries that honestly do not taste a day old--they could sell them for full price and fool me
5. A front room that is more social/buzzing (though by no means loud) and a back room that is more quiet and perfect for studying

BONUS: Everyone here, from baristas to customers, seems to be a major babe with more tattoos than Pittsburgh has bridges

The only con I can really think of is that it's a bit out of the way for me, but there's a bus stop literally right in front of the store, which makes it pretty convenient. Trying to time the buses can be a little annoying because they come very rarely and I don't have a bus schedule (seriously, does Pittsburgh make bus maps? I've looked everywhere I could think of and haven't found one), but this place is worth it."}
{"text":"Wow, what a pleasant surprise on Polish Hill. I had read about this place a while ago, and finally made the trek up the hill. 
The owner was patching a wall when we walked in (i like an owner who puts in his own sweat equity) He was pleasant and welcoming. Actually it was close to closing time and the brewed coffee had cooled, so he warmed it up with the steam nozzle which was fine, an quite accomindating.  My freind had iced coffee and iced tea (which they brew there in small batches) and he enjoyed both. The cookies were great the atmosphere cool.
I found it very comfortable and inviting. I hope to return soon and try more of the coffee and food items."}
{"text":"I love eating at Lili Cafe.. no detail is missed here!  The food is all awesome (the black bean burrito with avocado is my favorite!), great bakery treat options for dessert, a wide range of drink options (including my favorites- \"big berkey\" filtered water and locally made pressed juices) and they even have sriracha sauce which not all places have.  I seriously eat here like 2-3 times a week!  I love to sit outside when the weather is nice, but theres plenty of seating inside too.. and free wifi!"}
{"text":"Lili is a punk rocker owned and operated vegetarian cafe. They have excellent coffee, the food is well conceived, and the space is invited and relaxing. Try the \"Mind Cure\", their signature drink that contains espresso soda, coffee, and cream. Great art on the walls and good records spinning in the corner."}
{"text":"holy Fuck...where else can you hear black Sabbath @ 7 am...I thought I was the only one to do that!! egg/cheese on rye...with veganaise...Awesome!!  common place coffee...hell yea..."}
{"text":"I stopped in Lili somewhat unintentionally on my way up to Mind Cure records, directly above.  I'd been walking most of the morning and needed something to drink, but I became hungry as well when I saw their modest selection of sandwiches.  They guy at the counter was friendly and genuine as I talked to him for a few minutes as I decided what to get.

He brought my sandwich and drink to my table, which as others have said is a nice touch.  As I was sitting there, a few other people came in who had obviously been there before, and they were greeted as friends.  The iced tea I got was good, and the sandwich, toasted to perfection on a cold day, hit the spot.

When you look around Lili, you realize it is truly a Polish Hill cafe.  Along a window ledge and wall are numerous black and white photos of people and places around the neighborhood.  The rest of the art inside grabs your eye as well, but it fits in perfectly with the vibe there.

I'm already looking forward to getting back there in some warm weather to sit at one of the tables outside, or do some good people watching through their big windows.  Lili is definitely a place to check out if you're in Polish Hill."}
{"text":"Great Americano! Lili Coffee Shop is giving all my other favorite coffee shops a run... my Americano was PERFECT. The cinnamon raisin bagel with peanut butter was delicious, and the other food looked good, too. The atmosphere in the front is bright and friendly, and the back is cozy and homey. 

I've been meaning to try this place ever since I moved to Lawrenceville, and I'm mad that I waited this long! I can't wait to go again and will definitely be visiting regularly."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on my first visit to lovely Polish Hill. We got 2 mochas and a hot chocolate (it was 25 degrees and 5 in the afternoon). First of all, the prices are insane! If only it had been earlier and we could have gotten some cheap cappuccinos. The mochas were a little milky and sweet, but some people like it that way. The crowd on a Saturday was pretty normal, seating was limited but they have outside seating, too. The barista was very friendly and the punks outside here and Gooski's all said hey to us, so the locals seemed nice, too!"}
{"text":"Wish I could review the place, but alas, I walked in 20 minutes before closing time to be told by the none too pleasant girl behind the counter that she was closing up for the night.  Another time, perhaps?"}
{"text":"Love this sunshiny spot! The omelette & coffee were perfect."}
{"text":"I skipped out of work and went to Lili today for a late morning coffee and a lox bagel. If you ever have a chance, you should do the same. Its a funky, cool little cafe and coffeeshop nestled in the heart of the famous/infamous polish hill neighborhood. They do really great veg/vegan sammiches, but they have real cheese, eggs and lox as well. They have an old lp turntable and i *think* they borrow vinyl from the record store upstairs so prepare your brain for some groovy often eclectic beats while you dine. The coffee here is really good. Im not sure who their supplier is, but i dont drink alot of coffee and i think its pretty good. I used to live close enough to walk to this place, and i really miss it. Toss on an old black band t, throw on some shorts and ride your bike on over to Lili cafe, grab a coffee and a snack, and if its nice take a seat out on the patio and soak up the sun. So cool."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick cup of espresso and had no complaints. Strong brew with lots of crema. My wife had a latte and it was well crafted as well. 

Not much seating, but definitely a good place to stop alone or for two. We didn't have a chance to try any of their food but it looked good and wasn't too pricy."}
{"text":"so impressed - great little cafe with a huge menu & drink list. i wanted to try everything. will definitely be back!

i got the kimchi rice bowl, added a fried egg. ginger lemon tea. $9.75... cant beat that. i wish i had take a photo but it looked too good"}
{"text":"In order to finish my rounds of the Pittsburgh coffee shops, I've begun going to those that are a little out of the way of my normal driving routes. I went here today in order to check it out, mostly because I'd heard from some coworkers that it's a pretty cool place - I should have connected the fact that all the coworkers who mentioned it were a little punk/hipster and arrived with less expectations. Either way, the coffee wasn't amazing - served from a push-pot - high acidity and hardly any forward notes. My macchiato was more of a dry cappuccino, which is kind of my pet peeve at coffee shops. Making a macchiato properly is a requirement for me, meaning a double shot (preferably pulled short) stained with milk foam; all of this should fit into a demitasse. There are other variations, I just judge you if you use them. We also had a pastry, it was old, soggy, and sad.  I personally don't think it's a great idea to wrap baked goods up in plastic for over a day - because they generally get soggy in coolers. So, not the best, on the plus side though, everybody has really nice tattoos and the actual shop is comfy with a great view of the Polish Hill area. And they sell Red Star Kombucha, which is locally brewed and awesome. If I lived on Polish Hill, I'd get used to the coffee and set up shop here, but it's nowhere near worth driving to."}
{"text":"If you don't look the part don't bother. 

After recently moving here from NYC I've been on the hunt to find the perfect place to grab a cup and read a book. I walked in to stares, but no smiles. I ordered a large coffee to stay, but the barista gave me a to go cup. I noticed other people had ceramic cups, so that was a little disappointing. I sat down and read a chapter, but didn't feel comfortable staying much longer. I clearly stood out which didn't bother me but i guess other people don't want a \"shady side\" looking person in their shop. 

I will say the food smelled great, and they have a yummy looking menu. I would've definitely come back for food had the atmosphere been a little more welcoming. 

Different strokes for different folks. Hopefully other people have a better experience."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!  Literally one of the most unique and cutest coffee shops I have been to.  Everything from the great coffee to the awesome vintage and artistic decor should lure people in.  I just found this place and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Calling Pittsburgh home for many years, allowed me to wander the neighborhoods, finding the tucked away spots that are close to everything.  Polish Hill is exactly that, tucked between Baum Blvd. and the Strip District, bordered East/West by Downtown Pittsburgh & Lawrenceville, it is a community fitting for a resurgence, a re-birth.

The one vestige that has harbored the bold souls that found this enclave years ago, is Gooski's.  A Polish Hill institution that has weathered the years well.  One cannot consume alcohol all day & night ( some may argue this statement), so it is only fitting that the newest Landmark for the community be a coffee shop.  Named Lili, in honor of Rob & Carrie's daughter, the space is calming and comfortable.  

On my last trip to the 'Brugh, I made it a point to stop by my old haunts 
( The Beehive,  Starbucks on Carson St., Primanti Brothers in the Strip, etc.) and to find a few new additions.  Lili Coffee Shop is definitely a gem.  I spent 3 hours here, bumped elbows with friends coming & going, even got a great recommendation for a Massage Therapist in the neighborhood (the next review...)

The cuisine is perfect:  Quiche, Chili, Cookies, Brownies, Granola, Biscotti, and of course great coffee, chai, tea, etc.  I had the Quiche, savory to the last bite and made from scratch by a local baker/chef (Blythe makes everything! )  Rob's easy-going nature and great customer service make the experience seem like your stopping at a friend's house.

There is also a small room in the back for studying or an impromptu jam session.  The location is convenient, just off of Heron and an easy walk from anywhere on Polish Hill.  With-in the same building, there is a Record Store (second floor, Mind Cure Records, a project of Polish Hill resident Michael Seamans and Dan Allen. The vinyl-only shop will sell from a stock of about 8,000 records, including local releases. ) and a Comic Book Trove (the third floor will host Bill Boichel's Copacetic Comics, which is relocating to Polish Hill from Squirrel Hill, where it's been since 2001.)

Make the trip, take a walk with your dog (yes, Lili Coffee Shop is dog-friendly) and stop for a great cup of coffee with a new friend.  I will definitely return when visiting Pittsburgh again.  Oh, and I almost forgot, they serve a great Brunch on Sunday for $6.75 ( It is a steal!)"}
{"text":"Brunch here on Sunday is a fixed menu, which we didn't know.

I went to order and said, \"Can I get anything I want?\" and the woman at the register said, \"You can do whatever you want,\" referencing only what I can assume is 'the man' and then proceeded to tell me that no, I couldn't get what I want, it was brunch or nothing. Hahahahaha. We still laugh about it.

Aside from that, our food was excellent. It's a cozy place and I would definitely come back to try out their full menu. When I'm allowed, that is :)"}
{"text":"Nice little story book coffee shop on the hill.
Picturesque spot.  
Great for people who live in the neighborhood or visit from afar.
You'll see tattoos, bicycle messengers, townies, guys holding their babies in those sling support things that look really weird to me  on some guys : ), and people walking their dogs that sit down with their coffee at the outside tables.
It's a great hangout type of place that you don't find too often anymore.
You should go and support them and keep this type of place alive in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little gem in polish hill. Great coffee and treats! try the quiche! it's delish.. they also make their own handmade ice cream sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love the menu, the people, and how the food and drinks are prepared. My two favorite things to eat are the breakfast burrito and the rice bowl. My two favorite things to drink are the matcha latte and honey cardamon latte.  Nice neighborhood spot to run into sweet familiar faces, read a little, meet a little, and chill a little. Long Live Lili!"}
{"text":"I never would have known this café existed and thanks to a friend for suggesting it.  A hidden gem in Polish Hill.  We went for Sunday brunch-it is a small coffee shop which does have a back room with more seating.  For brunch it is a set menu of a few items and the regular menu offered during the week is not available.  Def. leaves you wanting to go back on a weekday as they have an extensive menu. This is very vegetarian & vegan friendly.  On Sunday we had our choice from a tofu or egg scramble which came with toast and a salad. The salad was fresh with sliced grapes and a tasty dressing.  Since I got the egg scramble sans mushroom but with cheese, onions and spinach I got the toast with a whipped chive butter.  Everything tasted amazing. As an added bonus your brunch came with tea and they have many flavors.  The décor inside is cute and a great place to hang out with friends and enjoy a cup or tea or coffee. Plenty of street parking."}
{"text":"This neighborhood coffee shop is full of laid-back charm and zero hipster 'tude ~ step inside and immediately feel warm and welcome. The barista's first words to me - an answer to my question about payment - set the stage: \"Yes, we're cash only but we do take I-owe-you's if you don't have enough on you!\" Huh?!? It's clear the owners aim to create a sense of community here, and there's a real feeling of goodwill. 

Sit inside or out at small, round European-style tables, or cozy up in the back room - a neat sofa-and-chair-filled space with children's toys and books and an array of vintage musical instruments and electric guitars for anyone to pick up and play. AWESOME. 

Compelling artwork hangs from the walls, sculptures peek out from the shop's nooks and crannies, and vinyl records spin on a vintage record player. 

All in all, it's a nice space to spend some time in, and nobody is going to rush you out. I had a big latte, which was quite good, and a macaroon, which was even better. My bill was under $5."}
{"text":"I hate to reveal this but this is the hidden treasure coffee shop in Pittsburgh. I absolutely love this place- the location in Polish Hill is perfect and the place is a perfect blend of spunk and character. The people who work there are laid back and great, and the patrons who come in are from around the neighborhood and very Polish-Hilly. The food in particular is great. I've been enjoying tomato soup and grilled cheese many times this winter, as the hot food is a perfect counter to the drabness of weather outside. As a vegetarian I really appreciate and enjoy places that serve good veggie food, and this place is perfect for my kind of taste. They even serve dinner a few nights weekly, and I've heard the food is top-notch. Definitely a recommend!"}
{"text":"Trendy little hipster place in Polish Hill neighborhood. Nice corner entrance, outdoor seating, small but quaint and a bit late 1960's retro.  The coffee here is solid. I had a Guatemalan on this morning, was very earthy, very good.  Pasties and treats are abound.  Good little place to go find if you're nearby."}
{"text":"You want to know what's fucking bullshit?

Lili's not being close enough to where we live, that's what.

This place is awesome, way more awesome than most coffee spots. Every now and then you'll see these lists created by some self-proclaimed know-it-all who names the top 10,15,20 must go to coffee shops in Pittsburgh and these goofballs seem to forget about Lili's. 

The place makes great coffee, serves great food for the price and provides a cozy atmosphere that is super fucking kid friendly.

The little bastards have their own little kid cave filled with cool kid shit.

The staff and clientele are good people, the kind of people you don't have to fight the constant urge to prevent yourself from punching them in the face repeatedly...

Even though we reside in greenfield for now, we still make the trip on a fairly regular basis.

P.S. Good sturdy chairs they have."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I'm kind of lame because I wasn't aware of Lili until I read the Post Gazette article regarding it.

It's in the middle of the up and coming (but don't tell the hipsters holed up there) Polish Hill and its bright red sign sticks out pleasantly amongst the drab row houses surrounding it.

The inside is eclectic and interesting. Posed figures walk up walls and odd art gives you something cool to look at while you sip your coffee. Their lunch selection seems interesting enough that I made a mental note to come back and try it. Their posts on Facebook about their weekend brunches make me feel like I need to go back very very soon.

The lattes we ordered were good, not great. I'm a bit spoiled with my close proximity to Tazza D'Oro, what can I say. My large latte came in a tall, glass drinking cup which I found kind of cool in an off-kilter way. Kinda like drinking wine out of chipped mugs while wearing flannel.

The pineapple upside down cake I bought was gooey and delicious. All of their  other homemade baked goods looked killer as well.

The barista behind the counter was bearded and all smiles and even brought out drinks to the table, something I didn't expect but turned out to be one of those little, warm things that make a place stand out.

I definitely want to check out Lili again, even if it's a bit too far away to be my local haunt. I'm especially interested in their brunch and lunch selection."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for Sunday brunch after visiting the Killer Heels exhibit at the Frick. We were all dressed up in our heels and 1950s dresses...and we did not fit the vibe of the other clientele at all. I loved Lili but my friend felt a bit uncomfortable. It was busy, but we did find a table in the back room. The staff were all very friendly despite the rush. I wished that they would have had the whole menu available-I really wanted to try the burrito! The post toast was great and surprisingly filling-I did add cheese and egg though. The cardamom (n?) latte was amazing and I loved the decor. I personally can't wait to come back, just be ready for a lot of black and tattoos. To each their own :)"}
{"text":"-6  If you would like some coffee served with a fresh plate of attitude this is the place.  If you are looking for unecessary argumentation that will ruin your day, this is the place.  The main dishes here are things that you would order for breakfast, but are served all day long.  The server will not acknowledge your presence when you come in.  They will be eating and chatting with regulars before you order something.  They will look annoyed because you are there, then take your order and serve you food only to then proceed to sit down with regulars and do some more chatting and eating.  Oh, ooops, she forgot to serve the woman in the corner waiting for her coffee.  The most slack worthy performance I have ever seen in my life.  It is really ashame because Polish Hill is a nice area.  It would make for a nice day out if you could stop by there to get some comics, records and enjoy some food/coffee.  For now I think I will pass on the coffee."}
{"text":"Great 3-level experience coffeeshop/record store/book store on a somewhat hidden corner in Polish Hill ... if you don't drive through Polish Hill, you'd never see this place but, it's worth seeking out and patronizing ... a sizeable menu of eats (mostly vegetarian, unfortunately) and all the usual caffeinated beverages in a nice bohemian/homey atmosphere/vibe ... 
  I had a mocha which was among the best i've ever had and bonus points - they had almond milk as an alternative to cow milk & soy milk ...  
  I highly recommend you go upstairs to peruse the book store and record shop before or after you caffeinate ... lots of gems to be found ...  
  Only negative was the small number of 4-chair tables being monopolized/held hostage by the laptop/iPad types (and no coffee in sight) even though people who had bought food and etc were looking for somewhere to sit .  This is rude passive-aggressive b.s. and you see this at other places like Espresso a Mano  and other cafes... if you're one of these people that do this - F.U. !!!  I'd love to see the baristas/manager intervene when this is happening ...
  I  hope to return many times ... hurray ... i love to discover a new coffee joint ."}
{"text":"Vegetarian perspective-

Lovely hidden coffeehouse and cafe gem in polish hill. We enjoy it most for its food menu which is vegan and vegetarian friendly. 

Coffee varies from very good to mediocre. Many drinks are on the cheaper side but volume for a small chai (also mediocre) is very small.

We love the tempeh rueben, vegan banh mi, and their salads are fresh and generous portions.
Be aware that on Sunday they don't do their regular full menu and have a brunch special of the day which we shared once and it (a stew) was delicious and very filling.

Service is always excellent, baristas are super friendly. There is a bathroom and back room seating."}
{"text":"Lili is perfect for us \"cafe campers\" who need to get some work done while also getting our java on. There are more tables inside, though if you're lucky, you'll get one by the window and experience the sunlight too! I love cafes that offer food in addition to coffee, since it really allows you to park yourself there for an extended period of time. What separates Lili from other cafes in Pittsburgh is that their food isn't just a grilled sandwich that some college student made haphazardly using their panini maker. HELL NO. Lili food rocks!!!! I started my morning with their delicious breakfast burrito and a cappucino. What a beautiful day that was. 

Parking is street and free (no meters). Not really difficult to find a spot, the bus does also go there. I know some people have complained about the baristas being clique-ish etc, I didn't really get that feel at all. And I have zero tattoos. They definitely have a \"regular\" crowd but I've noticed that to be the case for most of these places. They even have all these inclusive signs hung up like \"refugees are welcome\" and \"black lives matter.\"

I would ideally give the place 4.5 stars but I'm feeling benevolent so we'll round up. The only reason is that the mason jars they use for free water reeked of rotten eggs (think hydrogen sulfide smell - if that means anything to you).  But really, I feel if I had asked for a glass from their collection, they would have helped me out, so it's on me for not asking - but they should rethink their dish-washing policy."}
{"text":"I was in search of a coffee shop one late morning and remembered Lili.  I'd heard and read about this little coffee shop tucked away in Polish Hill, downstairs from Mind Cure Records.  I decided to give it a try.

The atmosphere definitely has a locals-only kind of vibe, somewhere between hipster and hippie.  It's not that I felt unwelcome there, but I wasn't really feeling the love either.  Service was not overly friendly or helpful, but not rude either.  I decided I needed a lot of caffeine and went with a latte and one of their signature drinks called the Mind Cure.  The latte was a latte.  I wasn't sure about the Mind Cure, a combination of coffee soda, espresso and cream, but once all the flavors mix together it became my new favorite drink.

I'm stuck between 2 and 3 stars because I would stop by again but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way.  I admit I see the appeal as a neighborhood hangout (as several people were camped out there with books and laptops).  However now that I've been able to recreate the signature drink, it's a little closer to the 2 stars."}
{"text":"Four stars for the brunch, but two for the service and atmosphere, so three stars fairly sums this place up. For starters, the pastries, coffee, and brunch offerings are all very good. The brunch in particular is a great value! In addition to a full plate of hot, high-quality food you get an orange juice and coffee for only $10! It's the price of a cheap diner, but with far better offerings. The menu changes weekly, and it's always something fresh and delicious with the option to make it vegan if necessary. They also seem to alternate between savory and sweet brunches, which is nice. It keeps your options open. I went with a group and we had savory goat cheese and pepper stuffed french toast with a raspberry drizzle on top. There was also bacon and a spinach side salad with a delicious vinaigrette dressing. Everyone loved it! I've also been back for cups of coffee, which were quite nice. I love a simple cup of coffee and a place to read a book more than almost anything else.

The problem I have is with the clientele, employees, and general atmosphere. I get it, you all love living in Polish Hill and want it to stay small and undiscovered. Does that mean you have to be rude and unfriendly to everyone without an inch of grease in their hair or ten facial piercings? I've never once been smiled at or given anything more than gruff, brusque service here. Sorry my day job requires me to look a certain way. I promise it's still okay to treat me like a human being, not an inconvenience to be gotten rid of. The snobby atmosphere (coming from people who probably haven't even been to Portland no less) is the biggest drawback about this place to me. I love the food. I love the visual appeal of the place. I love that there is a record store on the upper floor. I just rather dislike feeling hazed every time I come here."}
{"text":"I was meeting someone from Polish Hill, who says this is her favorite neighborhood cafe. I can see why! It's cozy and I love how it feels very local (they have lots of flyers up about events happening in Pittsburgh). I found that the menu offered lots of healthy and fresh choices at a great price. It's the kind of food that you would eat and feel good about eating. I got a kimchi rice bowl that was topped with a fried egg, and a pot of jasmine tea to share with my friend. I usually judge a place by how strongly I want to go back, and I very much want to go back to Lili!

The cafe has wifi and outlets. I saw lots of people there for work sessions, so if you need a new writing spot, Lili would be a great place to check out. The only downside is that as a person who doesn't have a car, the buses that go that way are not as frequent, so it will be difficult to go back. I hope I'll get a chance to soon though!"}
{"text":"very cool little coffee shop in the neighborhood i grew up in! good prices ,friendly barista, good coffees and baked goods. what the are open early ?cough cough (jeet in bloomfield now opens at 10 wtf) what they have simple syrup? cough cough crazy mocha (sugar doesn't melt in iced coffee) all in all i dig this place  and  would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I stopped in for iced coffee and late breakfast before a busy day. This place is great. It's small and covered in artwork, with tables both inside and outside. There's even a play nook for kids! I ordered the iced coffee and bagel with lox. The coffee was good, and im picky. It definitely hadn't been sitting for too long. The bagel and lox were good as well, with a generous portion of the fish. The atmosphere is quiet and laid back, if I was a student I would study here. The menu is fairly extensive in terms of food, with everything from granola and fruit to tempeh and bang mi. The prices are very reasonable, with all the food topping out under $6. Overall everything id want in a coffee shop!"}
{"text":"I went there once on a whim. I wanted to work from a coffee shop, but also some place that served food as I tend to work for hours without stopping.

Lili (pronounced \"Lily,\" not \"Lee Lee\" as I had previously thought) has a great menu - vegan and regular. The staff is really nice and I think the prices are just right. I was there for five hours, cozy and unbothered. Definitely my new go to for daylong projects!"}
{"text":"Now that I am living in Polish Hill, I realize that most people in the area have become accustomed to going out to surrounding neighborhoods for a lot of things.  It is nice having so many wonderful things nearby and easy to access with a walk or a quick drive, BUT what would be even better is there being more businesses here that are starting to cater to everyday needs and one of those needs for me, is my not made at home coffee fix (there is something about someone else making me a yummy latte that tastes better).  

Lili, now accepting debit cards (a huge plus as I would not have come here much before as I seldom carry cash), seems to also be expanding what they offer.  It looks like it is becoming more of a neighborhood cafe.  You know, how Panera tries to market themselves as your neighborhood bakery cafe. 

I am happy to have this as a part of the neighborhood but there is also room for plenty of improvement.  Like later hours, more food options, etc."}
{"text":"First time I tried to find this cafe I didn't...but don't give up. It's so worth it when you do
So the first time I came I was in search of golden milk tea
Tumeric and pepper milk honey it's an elixir supposed to help with body aches and pains I think it works and it tastes good so that why I came
That first visit I had a yum vegetarian Ruben a good hearty Sammie plus the golden milk 
All sorts of coffees and lattes and all sorts of milks
There are some inside tables and a couple outside.
The menu features everything from bagels to French toast bahn mi tempeh offerings plus vegan and vegetarian
Plus wolf teeth vegan donuts very nice
There are books to read and games to play 
Records and cassette tapes it's a nice vibe
The folks working there are all friendly and happy to explain their offerings 
Today 9/24/17 they have a fund raiser brunch for hurricane relief. It's a win win you buy yum food and they donate the money
Parking is easy to find on the street 
I'll be back"}
{"text":"This is a great little local cafe in the Polish Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. They offer a variety of teas, coffee and other specialty drinks. The back room is adorned with some local art for sale and there is the cutest little nook with some books and toys for kids. Maybe not the best place to go if you're looking for a super-fast breakfast. This is more of a sit-and-chill kind of place. While the service can be a little slow depending on the time of day and the crowd, the staff is always very friendly and the place is kept very clean!

I would recommend stopping by on a Sunday for brunch--a full meal with juice and tea/coffee for only $10. (Just beware-- they open later on the weekends!)The food is always fresh and healthy! They have a pretty large menu that is very reasonably priced, but the food availability greatly depends on what is able to be pre-made and what they have left. They have a lot of vegan and gluten-free options as well. I was very surprised at how delicious their Tempeh Reuben was!

This place is definitely a little gem of Polish Hill and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"A clean, well lighted place for coffee. Quiet too!

A friend of mine recently introduced me to this unknown spot hidden among the steps of Polish hill. 

They make excellent espresso drinks and a great cappuccino (To me this means a smaller cup with a thin layer of rusty foam containing a strong, bitter beverage.) They have a small assortment of pastries to go with your beverage.

The are three areas to sit: a small outdoor seating area that terraces up the hill, the main room seems to have plenty of empty tables seating up to 4, and a back room that is both quieter and not as warm on sunny days. Lili's has free wifi and there are ample outlets for your laptop.

Great place to chill and have a quietly productive afternoon."}
{"text":"Lili is a new fave for my \"caffeinated lunch\" fix. Great little selection of sandwiches - I love the vegan Banh Mi(!) and the tempeh reuben is good too. Sandwiches come with pickles on the side; major plus! They play excellent music (I wouldn't expect anything less with Mind Cure up above to curate the selections) and the shop is generally hip, but not in an exclusive way. Rather, it exudes a rad community vibe that you will either want to be a part of or feel repelled by because of your inability to feel comfortable in a genuinely cool place. Disclaimer: nobody is going to befriend you just for walking in the door and you might get a sunburn if you sit on the patio on a sunny day."}
{"text":"Rarely do you find a coffee shop with both excellent coffee drinks AND delicious food but Lili's has both. In addition to the ubiquitous lattes and cappuccino they have some really delicious specialty drinks (try the mâché latte for a unique and delicious take on a traditional favorite. Even their brewed coffee is exceptional. 

The food choices go way beyond the usual fare found at most coffee shops. Tons of vegetarian and vegan choices - carefully prepared and all delicious! I love the Bahn Mi sandwich and the tempeh Reuban is good too. I come here often and I have never been disappointed in my food, drink or the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would love to rate higher, and if someone had brought it to me, I probably would. Their food offerings are somewhat limited, but all delicious. I've ordered foods and coffees both times I've been here. I live right down the street and was excited to see such a promising cafe so nearby. 

Unfortunately, I have to reiterate what others have said - the culture here is very clique-ish. If you're prepared to brave rude stares and be excluded from casual chit chat, step inside and purchase a treat. Then leave."}
{"text":"We had planned to go to Lilliput but they were closed for vacation so we headed over here, their sister cafe, for breakfast. Their bagels and coffee were tasty, service was great, and the art and atmosphere was fun. It's kind of a hipster place, so when I walked in, I thought it would not be kid-friendly but they really seemed cool and friendly with the kids. There's also a cute little play space in back."}
{"text":"The decor and ~atmosphere~ of this place is great. I've been twice and go all the time to the 'sister' cafe (Lilliput located in the Pittsburgh Filmmakers). They have a great variety of vegetarian and vegan food, and really good coffee all pretty cheap too. The baristas/servers are always very friendly. Also there is a back room with more seating if it looks like you won't find a seat in the main room, and they have a gender-neutral bathroom."}
{"text":"It's a great little fixture in Polish Hill - definitely should be a list of best coffee places in the 'burgh. 

Not only is their coffee cheap but there's a record store upstairs! I think I could be under house arrest in this building and I'd be content.  I just wish they had more space for seating, but that can't really be helped."}
{"text":"One of the coolest spots in the city. Polish Hill has its own identity and Lili seems to fit it. The correct decor with awesome coffee. But really, I come her for the Tempeh Reuben. Vegetarians (and vegans) should run immediately here to try it. 

There's also multiple rooms and multiple businesses happening at once at in one building which is such a positive force and a great model. An easy 5 stars."}
{"text":"Lili is everything that the other reviewers have said it is; welcoming, beautiful, friendly, cheap and delicious. This place has become a sort of communal living room for us in Polish Hill; you come alone and you're guaranteed to run into friends.  Rob is wonderful and has let me pay with quarters and has taken IOU's when I was really broke. In the warmer months, the front patio is a great place to hang out and read a book with your dog, maybe meet some new people. I've heard complaints about the coffee, but it's gotten muuuuch better and is consistently delicious now. 

Seriously, go get lunch at Lili Coffee (I recommend the burrito or the tempeh reuben)."}
{"text":"this place rules... good tunes, rice bowls, bagels, sandwiches, coffee... do it all plz."}
{"text":"Ever want to step inside a postcard picture and enjoy the atmosphere as if you are a part of the fairy tale world?

This is Polish Hill, a cuddly, charming neighborhood with sweet Polish grandma's you'd want to hug randomly.

Lili's has this infused inside.  Whether you are alone or not, you get a feeling of being hugged when you are here.

Art, Staff and decor is stunning.  Coffee is fresh and strong. They use actual metal spoons to stir, that they wash. 
Upstairs is a record shop(VINYL ONLY!!) and comic book store

Cooler than any neighborhood or coffee-shop in NYC and infinitely more sincere"}
{"text":"If you live in Pittsburgh, go here right now. Seriously. Everyone go. I'm so glad my friend took me to Lili. I got a simple latte, but it was so wonderful I shed tears of joy, and the environment is really chill and beautiful. Walking into this cafe is a lot like walking into wonderland. The art, pamphlets, music, everything is fantastic. All of the food looks incredible and most, if not all, is vegetarian or vegan. I can't wait to try more of it. 

Attached are some niche shops that are also fantastic. 

I noticed right away that Lili supports a lot of local places too, and that's the punk thing to do. Local supporting local is a win. 

If you guys can't tell, I'm really excited about Lili. I only wish it were closer. It's not cost prohibitive (cheaper than Starbucks), and it's simply lovely. Go. Now."}
{"text":"I was here for a friend's book reading last night. nice Iced coffee no bad vibes. I did not try any food just a simple iced latte it was fine. 

Its the kind of place with an artists eye, lots things to look at I never really got bored, very small intimate space though. Its the kind of place I would curl up with a book in a rainy day if I lived closer to the area. Polish Hill itself is worth taking a troll around. St. Anthony's chapel boasts over 5,000 relics. If you're into that sort of thing. 

My order was not taken by a barista she looked like some sort of desert godess who just stepped out of a burning man dance circle. Tall blonde Tan with interesting tats up and down her arms and sticker star tan line in the center of her forehead. I was in complete awe. Not sure where she came from but it wasn't Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick espresso before our night out. I loved the neighborhood and this place does not disappoint on charm or coffee. Atmosphere is very artsy and very hipster. There were people working on their laptops (ie. free wifi), but the space is small so I would get here early if that's what you're planning on doing. I would love to go back again and spend more time here!"}
{"text":"Friendly neighborhood coffee house! The space is bright with plenty of nooks for quiet conversation - including a children's hide-away."}
{"text":"Love this place. Situated at the bottom of a precarious slope, Lili Cafe is a neighborhood favorite. I knew I would love this place when I saw the entrance display: \"Refugees Welcome.\" It is definitely quite hipster in its ambience - you HAVE to check out the inside. Great place to work as well - fast WiFi, many outlets, lots of tables. Also, the food is great for vegans/vegetarians. Every time I come here, I make sure to grab their avocado toast, which is fresh avocado on top of a piece of toast (rye or multigrain or white). There is also veganaise (vegan mayo) on it, which is quite delicious (and won't induce a cardiac arrest). Finally, they sprinkle a bit of this yellow garnish (not sure what it is), but it is delicious. I've also tried their honey cardamom latte, which is amazing. Finally, their hummus (sprinkled with some olive oil and spices and served with tortilla chips) is extremely fresh and filling. Big fan of Lili Cafe and will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Super cute little coffee shop with wooden floors and the unfriendliest vibe I've found in Pittsburgh.  I'm a newb to Pittsburgh and I'm used to people wanting to shoot the sh*t with me.  Not here.  Not a customer nor an employee was warm or friendly.  Does this place think it's too hip for me?  Think again, yo.  You are in Pittsburgh, not South Beach.

Despite not liking the cliquey atmosphere, I did love the look of the place and the relaxing old dixieland jazz music.  I might actually return here to study.  The coffee smelled really good - but I had chai."}
{"text":"This is a great little cafe nestled in the boughs of the charming Polish Hill neighborhood - it has an excellent vibe, first-rate coffee/espresso, and a commendable menu selection replete with a number of vegan options.  I really like the stellar artwork that bedecks the walls. Usually coffee shop art is tacky, banal, and/or amateurish - however, I've found all of the art on display in Lili to be both interesting and aesthetically pleasing. Lili's is the antithesis of an insipid commercial chain coffee shop -  it's definitely among the best hangout spots Pittsburgh has to offer.

***Update: I recently went to Lili's, and I guess the artwork rotates regularly. The stuff I saw today was really really poor quality."}
{"text":"Three words: Honey Cardamom Latte! I can't think of a better way to start the day! Sure the setting is super cool: artsy and chill. The service is friendly. And, the menu for both breakfast and lunch, is fantastic. Everything from pastries to omelets to bagels to sandwiches sounds great. I had a black bean burrito filled to beyond lifting with all things healthy and yummy (beans and brown rice and cheese and salsa and spinach and tomatoes and corn and avocado......). It came with nacho chips and little cups of salsa and sour cream. Super delicious and so huge that I (the girl with the incredible appetite) could not even finish it. Still, my memories will be all about that latte."}
{"text":"Okay, so I hate to be the debbie downer around all these 5 star reviews....but I was not impressed with my first experience at Lili Café. I discovered this place on Yelp after searching for new vegan/vegetarian friendly restaurants in the area. They have different tofu and tempeh options that come in rice bowls and various sandwiches. 

The restaurant itself is very quaint with a little patio area for outdoor seating. I stopped in 2 hours before closing and already, almost everything was out of stock, so I was not able to get what I originally planned on getting. Instead, I ordered the tofu banh mi, which to my surprise, was pre-made, refrigerated, and simply heated up when ordered. Call me crazy but I was expecting everything to be fresh. The banh mi came out half of it warm and the other half still ice cold. The bottom of the sandwich was soggy and the old tofu was completely dried out and chewy. I give them props for trying to stay true to the traditional banh mi ingredients. If it was fresh, it would've been 100 times better. While I was eating, there were about 10 flies trying to attack me for my food. The door was open so I guess it's unavoidable, but I'd like to enjoy my food without swatting flies away the entire time."}
{"text":"In the words of my partner, the Lili cafe experience is \"a delicious, healthy meal, served with a side of Scorn.\"

He and I have been to Lili a handful of times both separately and together, and it always seems like the staff have nothing but disdain for our presence.  What is it about our visage and manner that offends them so?  Too few tattoos?  Not enough vintage Riot Grrl band patches on our bike saddlebags?  One example: My first time for brunch we ordered at the counter, but because there were staff milling about tables, I did not think I needed to bus my table when we were done.  We got up to leave, and a very pissed-off-sounding staff person intercepted me to say, \"you need to bus your own table; we don't DO that here, asshat.\"  Okay let me emphasize that she definitely did, in reality, not say the word \"asshat.\" I'm taking creative liberties so you can properly appreciate the scorn dripping from every syllable. 

So there's the Scorn.  There is also the tasty food. They don't seem to much want our type of business, but we definitely want their type of food.  I have only had brunch, but my dining partner raves about how their sandwiches are some of the tastiest and healthiest in town with many vegan options. The brunches are delicious fixed-price plates-- usually a yummy vegetarian and a meat option each Sunday.  We had some sort of top-notch veggie scramble with a side of toast and potatoes, if I recall.  The front patio is airy and adorable in nice weather.  Just be sure to bus your own table ;)."}
{"text":"Although I've lived in Polish Hill since November 2010 this is the first time I've ever ventured into Lili's, and it most certainly will not be my last! This morning I took a few friends from Squirrel Hill on a walk around the neighborhood to explore and enjoy some exercise on our various sets of stairs. We decided to treat ourselves afterwards to breakfast and coffee and wanted to stay local, so Lili's was the place!

   As we walked in just after the place opened at 8 AM I first noticed and enjoyed the tile fresco on the floor of the exterior entry. We then entered behind two gentlemen and were treated to some relaxing classical music as we perused the menu boards. The two gentlemen were obviously \"regulars\", judging by how the barista (owner?) knew exactly what they wanted and brought their drinks to them without even having to take their order. I love the type of neighborhood-oriented establishment where people know you this well! After some browsing we placed our orders. My one friend ordered the lox (fish) with capers and cream cheese on a bagel with coffee. I ordered an apple, spinach, and cheese melt on a cinnamon raisin bagel, as did my other breakfast partner. I ordered an iced mocha, and I believe she ordered an espresso. At the last minute I added a blueberry muffin to my order because it looked too good to pass up!

    We sat at a nearby table and began to converse as other neighborhood residents entered for their caffeine fix en route to work. I shared my muffin with my friends, and it was delicious---moist and tasty. My one dining partner received his lox bagel almost immediately and remarked about how good it was. Our bagel melts took longer to come up, and the barista (owner?) apologize for the wait. To say it was awesome is an understatement. The atmosphere overall was very relaxed. After we ate we decided to explore a bit and were pleased to find out there was a back room with more plush seating and even a cute kids' play area built-in under the staircase that leads upstairs to two other businesses. 

    Living in Polish Hill you sort of have to compromise on leaving the neighborhood for most of your basic needs due to our dearth of commerce. With that being said I hope to now become a \"regular\" myself at Lili's, and I can't wait to take my partner here on my next weekend morning off for brunch!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop, cafe. Had a great iced coffee and a tasty lemonade concoction.  Vegan food choices are very nice, as well as the vegan sweets which were very good. Staff was super and helpful. Will definitely go back to try some more things. Had lots of vegetarian and regular food choices as well."}
{"text":"This place wins on location and low-key vibe. I always come here when I'm craving a lox bagel because their price is lower than any other breakfast eats place around me and every other place is too far away. Lili Cafe has an awesome little nook at the front where you can read, listen to records, cassettes, and CDs. The staff is always friendly and inviting. They have an extensive drink and food list. Their coffee and espresso options are delicious. I highly recommend giving this place a shot."}
{"text":"Great little place, very neo-hippie vibe ... I dont know I'm nearly 40, maybe I should say hipster or something,  but think funky art, obscure records playing, tats and piercings, Robotech colored hair and patchouli nearly overwhelming the smell of coffee brewing. Everyone is super nice, no one's scoffed at my lame jokes or lack of ink or dreads, or my penchant for buying a single hard boiled egg to go that i carry in my pocket ... oh yeah, and they make a damned good cup o' joe. 
For these reasons and more, I've usurped the dukedom here :-p Long live Duke Don! Lol

Ps. If you're rocking a Sunday morning hangover, do brunch here and grab yourself a Mindcure. Your brain will thank you."}
