{"text":"The  Guilin noodle soup is fantastic and flavourful. Noodles with beef brisket, half a hard boiled egg, delicious fermented vegetables, crunchy peanuts, fresh cilantro.  Don't forget to add the chilli oil. It's a great dish with a variety of textures; would definitely go back when in Calgary."}
{"text":"As far as I could gather in my halting Mandarin, Gui Lin Noodle houses a cooking style from Guizhou Province, mainland China and as also perhaps tucked in on the side streets of Taiwan: in a plain small venue 1/3 filled only with other Chinese peoples, we discovered okay fare...  The BBQ pork with steamed cabbage on rice, steamed fish on noodles with a separate soup, and a mild complimentary Chinese tea didn't make us sit up with the remotest 'wow.' Hence that overall we'd rate it at about 3.25.   As said, it was somewhat reminiscent of Taiwanese fare in smaller lower-class restaurants, but even there I'd rate it about the same. Nothing to get excited about, and as over there, not worth returning for.   But to you it may be worth a try (is a door away from Han's, our reason for finally going into City Plaza, but the latter closed Sunday).  Glad to experiment but just not there for us."}
{"text":"Love their brisket Taiwanese noodles, especially with an extra order of pickled sour vegetables.  A little disappointed that they hiked up the price again.  Their congees are tasty and good price.   They only accept cash.  Would liked it better if they accepted credit card, or at least debit card especially given their food items are getting quite pricey."}
{"text":"So my friends and I were starving for food, only to stumble upon this traditional Chinese restaurant. This place was good. I often get myself the special house fried   Rice because it has the mix all meat and sea food. It felt good to eat with every bite. This place is averagely small but your really there for the food. Menu selection is limited. There are other Chinese foods besides this place. With a shared washroom that needs a key outside the restaurant and into the small food court. Staff is good and not as busy. Food tastes delicious but nothing unique to make it stand out differently besides the fact that they serve food freshly cooked. Getting here is limited to street parking. Recommended for people who like traditional Chinese food."}
{"text":"Tried the Guilin Lamb Noodle Soup today. I'm a fan. It had lettuce, peanuts, pickled veggies and lamb.  The broth was very flavourful and if you add some chili oil; its even better."}
{"text":"Meh. This was my third try at Guilin Noodle and I think I've given up. I've never had anything that really impressed me and this last visit was really quite disappointing. I got the crispy fish with noodles and broth on the side. Nothing really worked. The broth was okay, but the noodles were on the mushy side and INCREDIBLY slippery and impossible to manage with the provided plastic chopsticks. The fish was nicely fried but almost devoid of flavour. There were all sorts of pickled bits and peanuts in there but they did almost nothing to perk up the flat, boring experience. On the table is chili sauce, black vinegar and soy sauce among other condiments, but I thought that adding any sauce to this slippery, mushy pile of noodles would make it impossible to eat- more impossible, I mean, as even though I can eat quite competently with chopsticks, these were really, really hard to convey into my disappointed pie hole.  Service was super fast and friendly and the price was... okay, but there are just so many better places to have lunch, even in that building."}
{"text":"Guilin Restaurant resides in the space where the old Double Greetings used to be.  Guilin brings cuisine from mainland China.  We tried different dishes:  - Dumpling Soup - I like the dumplings which are obviously hand-made; broth is pretty good; small bowl - maybe 8 dumplings - Jar Leung - Deep-fried Chinese Doughnut rolled in rice sheets - quite tasty - Beef Chow Fun Guilin style - tastes just like Beef Chow Fun to me - Fried Noodles Guilin style - lai fen or thick rice noodles fried with pieces of beef and little shrimp with cabbage, carrots.  It was good.  I like mine spcied up with the chilli oil. - Beef Brisket Noodles (dry style) - really tasty with beef brisket cooked with spices like star anise.  Comes with a half egg.  I like this noodle dish that came in a bowl.  I still like mine spiced up with chilli oil.  Tea is free.  The restaurant gives out a card for the no. of dishes you order and the 10th one is free!"}
