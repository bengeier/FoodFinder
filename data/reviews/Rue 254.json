{"text":"I love this place! Just popped in not knowing anything about it and was really happy I found it! Sat at the bar for a tasty glass of wine and was so pleased to have a wonderful bartender, Heather, who actually had a personality! A great personality! Heather went above and beyond to tell me all about the place, the menu, and helped me get a great seat at the cozy fireplace. I know this will be my new favorite place because I felt right at home from the minute I walked in the door, thanks to Heather! By the way...I was a single female walking in here and usually don't get treated so nicely as a single female. I will be back often! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very nice experience. Long way from old Winking Lizard and, for those who remember, Miller's Dining Room. Dinner for four adults and two children was more than capably handled by a very friendly wait staff on a busy February Friday. All meals, including those with special requests, were served without issue and tasted delicious. Of special mention was the beer battered perch meal which was not only fantastic but huge. The servers were especially good with the children, ages 7 and 10. We will be making this a \"go to\" restaurant. Looks like a lot of time and effort was put into this venture."}
{"text":"Went to Rue for the first time for lunch the other day. My server was terrific and the meal more than met my expectations. I will be back soon. An excellent addition to west side dinning."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the food. Steak was ordered  but after ordering waiter explained they were out of that particular steak. They offered another steak substitute  which cost more. After some persistent discussion they agreed to charge the price of the original order  The salad was tasty but very small portion. 4 out of 6 meals were  served with wrong sides and barely at room temp. This is a new restaurant but they really need to step it up. Not sure we would return. The noise level was horrible . They need to do something about that as you have to shout to talk to the person across the table."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at the new Rue 254 tonight. Place was packed. It was nice to see what they did with the place from the old Winking Lizard. Nicely done inside. Our table of six had issues with their order. They ran out of particular steak but it was substituted with another at no additional charge. My husbands and my strip steak had a lot of gristle but still flavorful. My BIGGEST COMPLAINT is the NOISE LEVEL upstairs. It has an open ceiling with no noise buffer at all. I could not hear the conversations going on at my table, much less my girlfriend sitting next to me. I felt like a third wheel.  It seemed like all the tables were competing with each other to be heard.  I'm sorry, but I want to be able to enjoy my dinner and my friends and be able to talk and be heard and not have a shouting match. I won't be back again until they resolve their noise issue.  It was not a happy evening for me."}
{"text":"Just had a great meal with my in-laws and kids at Rue 254.  They have a great early evening special program that extends to 8 pm on Sunday's.  I had the french onion soup and excellent filet.  My kids had the burger and fish and chips and both gave a thumbs up.  We will be back for sure.  I'm looking forward to sitting on the patio when it's warm outside."}
{"text":"Its an ok place. Fish was a bit mushy thou. Also, kind of over priced."}
{"text":"Hmmmm. The door was locked at11:50 am today  even tho they  open at 1130 for lunch. As we were leaving, the host came over and opened the door and said he wondered why no one was coming in.  My $17 \"big salad\" lunch was supposed to be full of roasted vegetables and topped with shrimp.  Well it was lettuce with a little bit of really small chopped vegetables, including some inedible stick like asparagus, and a few undercooked  shrimp. My friend's salmon salad was substantial and she loved it.The music was loud  and the server was so inexperienced I felt sorry for her.  Not worth $50 for 2 for lunch, my friends."}
{"text":"Had the Rue 254 Burger was not impressed.  Did not have any flavor and fries were cold.  I expected more out of a $14.00 Burger.  I am giving it a 3 because of the updated decor."}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service.  It took us over 30 minutes to get our drinks.  Then one of our dinners was served 20 minutes after everyone else in our party.  Seems like the bar and the kitchen aren't well run."}
{"text":"The renovation was an improvement.  We dined during the holiday season so the restaurant looked festive.  Question what the decor will look like when the decorations come down.  Very limited wine selection.  Four of us dined and ordered four different entrees.  Duck burger,pasta,city chicken and the lamb sandwich.  None of the meals were hot.  The food quality was fair.   Having a quality independent restaurant in Westlake is rare and we really wanted to enjoy Rue.  Unfortunately we must continue to wait."}
{"text":"I would skip over the naysayers and try this place out for yourself.

My wife and I had a fantastic experience. We tried both the apple and blistered tomato \"toasts\" as well as the meatballs for appetizers. All of which were delicious. 

For her entree, my wife ordered the roast chicken. The chicken was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. My wife is very picky, and she was delighted. 

For my entree, I ordered the Rue 254 steak with a side of the au gratin potatoes. The steak was delicious, and cooked exactly to my order. The peppercorn sauce was a nice touch. The superstar, though would have to be the potatoes! Very unique presentation, and great flavor. 

Our server was very friendly, and accommodating. The manager also stopped by our table to check on us. 

Despite ordering several appetizers, entrees, and several drinks, our check was still very reasonable. We will surely be returning sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Just had Sunday Brunch at Rue 254.  Service and food were top notch!  Such a nice diverse brunch menu.  Something for everyone.  We had the homemade artisanal breads, a true bargain at $6.00.  I had the egg/hash special, it was delicious and very generous portion.  Our entire party enjoyed our meals.  Everything from pancakes and eggs to much more adventurous brunch items.

Prices were very reasonable.  Although we were not drinking this morning, nice to know I could have ordered a Mimosa or a Bloody Mary had I desired.

Highly recommend Rue 254 for brunch!  Also, look forward to dining outside once the weather permits!"}
{"text":"Great time with friends. Calamari and rue steak was awesome. Wine list nice. And Sandy gave us great service."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences ever. Way overpriced...small 30-40 dollar wine list. Dinner was awful ,my wife ordered the shrimp and artichoke salad . Artichokes tasted like right out of can greens were funny tasting. I ordered fish and chips which the fish was like mush.Appetizer was 2 small pieces of toast with apple slice on it for 5.00. We would have gotten shrimp cocktail but the shrimp were 5.00 Each! So 30.00 for the average shrimp cocktail. Dining area same as old Winkin' Lizard with a new paint job. Half of the back area is taken by a couch and table with 1 chair on the side A couple were sitting there with the guy having his feet on the table...must of been from the trailer park .Keep going and pass this place up go to Parkers in Avon instead. Oh also we were both sick that evening from the crappy food...enough said."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here this evening, and everything was spot on, from the freshly baked bread, to the perfectly sauteed brussel sprouts, to the expertly prepared \"Rue 254\" steak. 
Decor is modern and unobstrusive. White tablecloths, but not an overly formal atmosphere. 
The only thing I would like to see changed is the wine list; wines by the glass are pretty limited, and we don't need (or want) a whole bottle of wine for two people.
As to the other comments regarding noise level; this was absolutely not an issue for us in the dining room. Granted, we were there early in the evening, and so the restaurant was not full, but the noise level was not high at all. We were able to carry on a conversation in a normal speaking voice with no problem."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times and each time has been enjoyable. Food is good (love the toast options on the appetizer menu!) and the service is prompt. Nicely decorated and renovated. I did give 4 stars and not 5 due to the prices- they aren't terrible, but are a little high for what the food is."}
{"text":"Nice design, kinda Classy Chic. Service was friendly, but slow. Food was mediocre. 

Had the fish fry and upgraded to Perch. Didn't realize it was beer battered. Not my cup of tea. But there was a ton of it. 

Also had the clam chowder. Good, but not great. We also had a flat bread pizza with something like Indian style chicken. Tasted like pizza with Indian style chicken.  If that's what your into, it may have been good. 

Lastly, there was a hot chicken Caesar salad. It was ok and the best dish on the table. 

If the slow server had been grumpy, no question this would have been 2 stars at best. 3 stars gives the benefit of the doubt to poor ordering off the menu."}
{"text":"I will not be coming back for dinner or recommending them to anyone. Upon arrival our party of seven was told we would have to wait before we could be seated for our reservation. Even after greetings, a round of drinks, and sharing pictures, we were told our table still was not ready. Would we like more drinks? The lounge is designed to look like a living room, including a fireplace, and is very nice  but we were getting hungry! Some tables were rearranged so that we could be seated about an hour after our reservation. Our server was very nice but not up to the task. She brought drinks we did not order and struggled to fill the two water glasses being used. After appetizers, which were tasty, she delivered salads to incorrect recipients. After much waiting. Four or five of the dinners arrived. Many minutes later, the remaining dishes appeared. One of the entrées had been waiting so long that it was no longer hot and needed to be sent to the kitchen for reheating. The food was good to mediocre and the service bordered on neglectful."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the 1st time last evening with 5 other friends.  Interior is very nice...service was good; however, food did not even come close to our expectations.  We started with calamari and stuffed banana peppers.  Peppers were okay...calamari was very chewy and a very small portion for the price.  Clam chowder was the soup of the day and it was just ok.  I had the mussels and they were honestly the worst I have ever had.  VERY fishy...I find it hard to believe they we PEI mussels.  Broth was good but the mussels were not.  2 of the people had the fish...one had the cod the other the perch.  Only 2 fish filets to a plate that were mushy, not flaky inside with a overly large pile of fries.  For the price more filets were expected.  One person had the walleye and while he said the flavor was okay he unfortunately spent the rest of the evening in the restroom.  The person who had the sirloin said it was good as did the person that had the mushroom flatbread.  Bill was over $200 (we did have some drinks) and for that price we were all terribly disappointed in the quality of the food.  Overall a very disappointing evening."}
{"text":"Really great spot. Food was good. Really innovative cocktail list. Our server heather was AMAZING. She made us feel so comfortable and welcome. She was really funny and on top of it. We will definitely come back again and request the same server."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in both the dining room and the service.  Also, the prices were much higher than expected for a restaurant of this style.
The evening began very bad when the hostess seated us right under a a/c vent.  Very uncomfortable.  We were moved to a different table.  Shortly after, the same hostess tried to seat three more couples at this table and all asked to be moved.
The main dining area is in a low hard ceiling area and lost of windows which results in very high noise!  The room needs major acoustic treatment to be acceptable.
This place started as a Miller's many years ago, then changed owners (forgot name) and my wife and I ate there several times and always had a good experience.
Later, it became Winking Lizard which was always noisy - but expected that in any Lizard place.
When Rue 254 opened, we expected more like Miller's and the follow-on place, but actually was more like Lizard - a noisy sports bar.  With way overpriced food.
Contrastingly, on our way out, we walked through the bar and lower level which was much quieter.
So ... if Rue 254 changes its prices and quiets down the upper level, I may go back.  But probably not.  There are many other nicer places around."}
{"text":"Super disappointed by our experience.  My wife and I split the meatballs and shrimp cocktail and both were poor.  I've had better shrimp from a grocery store and the meatballs had no flavor.  With two drinks, a tab of $85 is ridiculous.  I will never go back and am not surprised we were two of very few people there.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Above average food and drink options. Hours are a little weird. First few visits were in the dining room and service was average. Then the bar a a few times and service was better."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here. Excellent, attentive customer service. The food was great. We had the 254 Steak and the Faroe Island Salmon. Superb. Had the Mezze Plate as an appetizer. Make sure to order the Au Gratin Potatoes. Everything made from scratch. Creme Brulee for dessert. Wow. Place was packed. Lots of happy diners. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"It's not the Winking Lizard anymore. Not a family friendly location anymore. I miss the staff and the friendly faces."}
{"text":"Went here last night for an annual Christmas dinner to go to somewhere new and so happy we did! An order of the olives as the appetizer was perfect - warm and flavorful and enough to share. Entrees ordered: Rue 254, side of Au gratin potatoes, and roasted chicken. All were done and prepared wonderfully. Never really order dessert, but did tonight. Had the apple crisp. Very good. Not too heavy. Sat in a high top in the bar area which was loud, but not deafening and could still hear my dining companion across the table. The decor in the bar area are B&W framed quotes are fun. All around a good experience. Will be back to sit in the dining room."}
{"text":"Definitely loved the atmosphere and look. Was super quiet which is nice for a date night. However, I was not too impressed with the food. I ordered a 1/2 roast chicken with mashed potatoes and it was swimming in oil. I asked the manager when he came by to ask how everything was what it was and he said it was the au ju sauce but I think it was way too thin. Also, the food was not hot. My husband ordered his steak medium well and they served it medium. All this to say we had a wonderful evening talking and enjoying the atmosphere and each other's company. I would go back because I try everything three times before making a decision because you never know what could be going on at the time you're there. 

P.S. We ordered there salted caramel affogato for dessert and that was delicious!"}
{"text":"We were curious about the new restaurant replacing the Winking Lizard.  The host and servers were all very pleasant.  However, slapping a fresh coat of paint on the walls and jacking up the price of everything is probably a poor business decision.  You might want to change the name as well.  The definition of Bistro:  a small or unpretentious restaurant.  This place wreaks of pretentiousness!"}
{"text":"We had a baby shower here this past weekend and WOW! We were hosting it and were told we could arrive at 10:30 am as we were doing a brunch starting at 11:30 and being on time we were met by numerous staff members. They helped us carry up all our decorations while still being VERY professional and helpful they helped us set everything up. It was such a dream. We had close to 60 people coming and they made everything move so smoothly. Now to get to the food and service! The food was fabulous! (chicken Milanese, strata, Pear Gorgonzola salad, French toast etc) it was like we ordered the food and what we got on our plates was just made even though it was a buffet! The service continued to be great i.e. All attendees were always served drinks and food replaced as warmers got even close to being low even with all the craziness of our families. After the shower we went downstairs and got a good look at the restaurant and bar areas and WOW again, what a beautiful set up. By the looks of the people eating in the restaurant side looked like they were really happy with what they were experiencing give RUE 254 your business and highly recommend them for your private parties!"}
{"text":"We went with a small group to celebrate a birthday and we had a lovely time. The food was well thought out, balanced, and flavorful.  The waiter did a wonderful job, knew the menu well and even made suggestions for gluten free adaptations for the one in the party with dietary limitations. We will definitely go back. The charcuterie was a hit."}
{"text":"I'm not from the area, but it seems like a hidden gem. Not too busy at the bar on a Wed night, which was perfect. Bartenders were very attentive to their guests.
Unique twist on the wedge salad--egg and pickle?? WORKS!
Bolognese was pretty traditional, and fantastic!
Could use a larger wine selection, but not bad.
Porterhouse was huge-pork BTW....looked amazing. 
Slightly Greek twist on the menu?
Would be a great date spot if you want to chat and chill."}
{"text":"Started with flatbread and calamari. Perfectly executed. The calamari was so fresh and delicious we found ourselves slapping the other's hand away. The flatbread was generously proportioned and made with premium ingredients (wild mushrooms, awesome blend of cheeses, arugula). Entrees matched the standard. My Rue 254 Steak was tender and flavorful and just the right serving size. Salmon was paired beautifully with a balsamic glaze and the crust did not impact the tender moist and properly seasoned experience. The vegetable spaghetti devoured and a bacon Brussels sprout flatbread massacred by my sons. This, our first visit, summed up by my 8yr old \"we can come here more often\", and I think we will!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Ordered a bunch of different apps, and they were all amazing! Our entrées we delish, service was great,  no complaints here.  We will for sure be going back!"}
{"text":"I had Father's Day brunch with my family at Rue 254.   The restaurant atmosphere is very nice, but the service and food were quite mediocre.  Going around the table, I had a chance to sample everything from pancakes, home fries, breakfast sausages, French toast, fruit, coffee and omelettes.  What can I say?  The quality was quite poor.   The pancakes were rubbery, the sausages tasted of mostly fat (cheap), the omelettes were quite poorly made, and the coffee was rather poor as well.   I can say that the French toast was well done, but that was by far the exception.   Honestly folks, a meal at Bob Evans or Perkins would have been far better, and we wouldn't have had to wait an hour and a half between sitting, ordering, receiving our food and finally getting the paycheck.  Maybe it was an off day, but I was embarrassed for having suggested it."}
{"text":"Taki has done it again.   Very nice decor     wait staff is very courteous and professional.   Appetizer mussels and tuna were excellent.  We had the Lamb French dip.  It was great.  Different but great.  The burger was simple but fab.   Don't know what more to say.   A solid four stars."}
{"text":"I took my friend here for a birthday dinner.  The only nice thing I can say about the place is our server, James, was very kind and patient with us.  However, the dining experience overall was appalling.  The first things we ordered were drinks.  I ordered the Moscow mule and my friend ordered a bloody mary.  The Moscow mule was so terrible I couldn't even drink it.  I drank maybe 3 sips from the glass.  We then ordered an appetizer of warm chips and blue cheese fondue.  When it arrived the chips were so burnt they were nearly black.  We sent them back, the waiter then let us know that they make the chips at the beginning of the day and the entire batch looks like that so there was no way for him to correct the problem other than to take them off our bill.  We both ordered the French onion soup, I will give them the French onion it was good.  However, easily could've been store bought.  For the main course I ordered a burger and my friend ordered the dayboat scallops.  The scallops were barely seared and were extremely gelatinous inside.  We sent them back and when they came back the chef brought them out with an extreme amount of attitude.  She then asked my friend to eat them in front of her to make sure they were to her liking.  It sounds nice but her demeanor was that she was extremely displeased with us.  I don't know if this is a typical thing for a chef to do since I traditionally never send anything back to the kitchen in fear that it will come back covered in spit.  I was thrilled I opted for a burger since it's nearly impossible to mess up.  Our bill was 77 dollars and I can't say I ate anything that was good.  I will never come back to the restaurant again and based on the amount of people that were inside the restaurant at 8:00pm on a Friday night, I must not be alone in this thought."}
{"text":"My friends and I celebrated our annual Christmas get together at Rue 254 last night.  The atmosphere was very nice and festive.  Our waitress Sandy was exceptional.  We had a great time.  The food was good.  I had the roasted chicken and the starter salad.  Both were enjoyable.  I would go back to try some of the other entrees to see what stands out."}
{"text":"This week, I found out Rue was under new ownership and was excited to check it out, again! We have been many times, and have always had nice meals with friendly service. However, if last night was any indication of the direction in which the new owner is headed; count me in!! 
We started the meal with two new appetizer specials: scallops and oysters. I typically do not order scallops out, as they are rarely cooked to my liking, but Tracy (the loveliness behind the bar) insisted. They were PHENOMENAL! Paired with an edamame and corn salad, perfect on a warm summer night (wouldn't turn it down in the winter eitherI don't eat oysters, but my fiancé said he could have eaten 20 more, they were so delicious!
We also had a chance to meet the new owner, Tony. He struck me as a high energy, hands-on owner with tons of experience. I am so excited to see what else he has in store for the restaurant! I can tell you that this was, by far, the best meal I've had at Rue! 
Tracy and Matt are two of the best in the business, and I am always happy to see their faces behind the bar; extra happy to see their excitement for the future of Rue 254, matched only by mine! Good job, Tony!!"}
{"text":"Mashed potatoes with everything . . . really?  My husband had the cod (with mashed potatoes) and I had the filet (with mashed potatoes).  I have to note that this was their early evening special which runs until 8:00 p.m. on Sundays.  It includes a starter and the entree for $19.95.  The downside is that you can't substitute anything.  Therefore, you end up with fish and mashed potatoes or steak and mashed potatoes.  It also came with brussel sprouts which were quite all done.  I ended up leaving most of the mashed potatoes and sprouts on my plate.  We both had the french onion soup, which was tasty but a tad salty.  We both wish we had ordered a salad instead.  For the cost, I am not sure why anyone would bring their kids here but there was a large group with about four kids.  The parents let them wander around.  Not the restaurant's fault but it would be nice to go to a nicer place without kids running around.  What the polite way of telling someone to rein in their rugrats?

The server was very nice and attentive.  

Guests were dressed in everything from jeans to dressy clothes.  Keep in mind that the wait staff dresses in dressy white shirts and jeans covered with a long apron."}
{"text":"Did such an amazing job transforming the whole restaurant!! The food and atmosphere is awesome!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is sophisticated while relaxed; menu is varied; great wine list by the glass and bottles; We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is GREAT!!  Had the French onion soup as an appetizer, Rue 254 salad, Rue 254 steak with sides and the Moulton lava cake for dessert.  Everything was delicious, will definately make this a regular dining spot....You will NOT be disappointed:))))"}
{"text":"The food was okay overall, but the awkward service pushed the overall experience down to two stars.

On a Friday evening we were seated right away without a reservation. The dining area was quiet. It made for a good spot to chat and relax for awhile. This replaced the old Winking Lizard and offers a variety of seating options. They have two dining areas, a bar area, and an outdoor patio. The parking lot in back is large and provides plenty of parking. 

I ordered the Dayboat Scallops. This was probably not the best option. The farro risotto under the scallops was delicious. I enjoyed the fresh asparagus on top too. The risotto alone would make a nice meal. The scallops had a nice flavor, but otherwise were all wrong. Again, I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered scallops since I've only had them from fine dining restaurants.  The scallops were gray and stringy. The texture and color were all wrong. I don't think it was a food safety issue, but merely poor preparation. My mom had the Pork Milanese which she enjoyed, but it didn't wow her. I think my aunt felt the same about her entrée salad. The portions on all of our meals were generous for the pricing.

The service was very awkward. First, I must say that our waiter did check on us often. He also refilled waters and brought our bread and meals in a timely manner. The awkward part was when we ordered our meals. He was really pushing drinks initially, but then was doing a hard sell on soups or salads before the meal. This is my pet peeve, but this alone would have been permissible. When we declined starters and drinks he commented \"I must be a piss poor salesman since I can't sell you anything.\" I frequently dine out and this was a first for sure. Maybe I should have returned the awkwardness by letting him know we weren't drinking because we'd been at my grandmother's funeral most of the day."}
{"text":"A colleague suggested lunch out, and since I haven't tried Rue 254 yet, we ventured there. 

First impression walking in: I was impressed with the renovation. The feel is very sophisticated, but not overly stuffy. It is bright, open and airy. We sat upstairs, facing Detroit Road. 

The service was prompt and friendly. The menu had loads of interesting options, but not too many vegan dishes. I ended up ordering the french onion soup and the pear/salmon salad (minus the salmon). Both were tasty choices, but the kitchen forgot to hold the bacon on my salad. I spent more time than I'd have wanted digging the bacon out. Not an unforgivable sin, though :) 

When the check arrived, the server mentioned that he removed $4 since I did not get the salmon on my salad. That was an unexpected and nice surprise! 

While things were not exceptional, they were definitely A-OK. I'll give them a few months to work out some kinks and give them another try."}
{"text":"Good food!  Excellent happy hour and the baretenders Heather and Tracy were very personable and friendly!  Thanks for great service!"}
{"text":"At lunch a $17 lamb sandwich should be a star. Price is not a concern when the item fulfills the promise. This failed miserably.  Our waitress led us to believe a salad was included--it was not.
I enjoyed the space but I will wait for them to earn more ratings."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant yesterday. We were very happy with it. Wonderful atmosphere and great service. The food was good. We were there for lunch. They had a nice lunch menu, which was pretty reasonable. I like that they offered a prixe fixed lunch, which consisted of soup, salad and half a sandwich. It is very cozy and quaint. They also have beautiful outside places to sit. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Thank you to such an amazing staff at Rue 254 for giving my family another memorable experience. Taki produced a wonderful brunch menu that pleased all our guests. The servers, Sandy and Kathy, did an awesome job! The guest's needs were always met and they helped maintain the flow of the baby shower.  The managers, Christina and Mark, helped answer our endless questions and accommodated all our needs! Everyone there truly made my sister's baby shower a happy and blessed afternoon. Thank you again Rue 254! Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"After driving past this restaurant several times my husband and I decided to stop for dinner one evening. The outside of this restaurant along with the \"bistro\" on their sign fooled us into thinking this was a casual eatery so we arrived wearing jeans and sweatshirts and felt TERRIBLY underdressed. This is definitely a more upscale place than it appears from the outside. 

That said, we stayed to eat and ordered the cheese curds appetizer (very tasty), Rue 251 steak with their \"famous\" gratin potatoes, and the Dayboat Scallops. The food was good but my steak was WAY overdone - I ordered it medium well and it was burnt. The potatoes had a terrific flavor and the portion was huge but there was a crunch in the middle that indicated they weren't fully cooked. The scallops were the star of our table and so well-cooked and delicious but the portion was very small, especially for the price. Our total bill came to nearly $80 just for food as we both ordered water to drink. 

Service was fantastic and ambiance was wonderful but I doubt we'll dine here again. Too expensive for a meal that didn't deliver."}
{"text":"A nice addition to an our growing independent restaurants on the west side of Cleveland.  If you have not seen the inside since Winking Lizard, stop by for a drink/bite soon.  It's quite nice and the remodeling adds ambiance.  We have enjoyed every meal/drink/appetizer and especially like the outdoor patio.  The staff is very accommodating as well.
I am celiac and although they do not have bread/pasta there are many choices and will work with your dietary restrictions.  
Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Super impressed. All worked so well together especially for an opening night. Class act but cozy and friendly!!! LOVE this gem of a place. Will definitely be regulars! 

Started with a bottle of house Zinfandel wine - really great for the price. Two in our party got the Bootlegger cocktail - it tasted very light - thinking it would be better straight up or with minimal ice. 

For starters we had the Burrata. I love Burrata and this was good but needed more seasoning and maybe just olive oil and some herbs.

After the appetizer a bread basket came out - whole wheat rolls....just okay and butter served was super cold so hard to spread. Recommend restaurant serve room temp. 

French onion soup was tasty and good sized, filled with plenty of awesomeness! Would definitely order again!

Our table ordered the roasted chicken - was delicious!!! Moist, great flavor, the greens were perfectly seasoned, and the sauce was yummo. 

We also had the fish and chips which were \"proper\" .... Would make the Brits proud. 

The filet mignon was tender, cooked as ordered to perfection and well seasoned. 

The Au Gratin potatoes were THE BOMB!!! And I hate Au gratin potatoes! These were something else....and amazing. Gruyere maybe. Delicious. Definitely order these!!

For dessert we ordered one of each!!! Salted caramel ice cream with espresso poured over, creme brûlée, apple crisp and chocolate molten lava cake. Okay....all were AMAZING!!! But my goodness we are all in L-O-V-E with the salted caramel espresso dessert. SO FRIGGIN DELICIOUS!! OMGenius!!!!

Kathy was our server and we LOVE her. So nice and helpful and we will always request her. 

Come here now! Great addition to Avon!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional restaurant! Very classy yet casual. Had reservations but arrived a half hour early and enjoyed relaxing with drinks and an appetizer on the soft seating by the fireplace. The food was superb...Nonnas meatballs as a starter were tasty and the ahi tuna and stuffed banana peppers were outstanding. The staff was friendly especially our waitress, Elizabeth, who provided great service throughout the night. Very impressed with the restaurant and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very casual and relaxing .  Food choices are excellent .  

I opted for the filet and it was delish! 

Can't wait to try more off the menu !"}
{"text":"Food is great, drinks are the way they should be!
Need new light fixtures.
Great outdoor patio.
Great building with Cleveland history."}
{"text":"A group of six went for dinner this past week. Walking in was wonderful to see the transformation from the old Winking Lizard. It is sophisticated, clean and airy. There are no signs of the former Winking Lizard. We were seated upstairs facing Detroit Rd. very comfortable by the fireplace and felt like a perfect place to celebrate the season. 

Our server Sandy was knowledgeable about the menu and offered some great suggestions. She was a great server who was efficient and engaging. Would ask to be seated in her section the next time.

The food was good, in my opinion, but nothing stood out as being remarkable. I would go again to see if improvements have been made in the kitchen, but only because the atmosphere and server were top notch."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is awesome! Very relaxed and nice! The staff was great and our server James was one of the best servers I've ever had. He was amazing at suggesting appetizers and entrees, along with choosing the perfect bottle of wine to go along with the scallops the majority of our 7 person party ordered. The scallops were cooked to perfection, but the appetizers were something I may skip next time, which is why I docked a star. However, the cocktails made by Caitlin at the bar were outstanding, and I was over all very pleased with my visit! Will definitely be returning soon for those scallops!"}
