{"text":"Had the chicken and waffles at the squirrel hill block party, was amazing

The chicken was crisp and tasty, the waffles were perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Refreshing and different.. I had the pleasure of trying out the food truck today at lunch..  and one word sums it up  \"FUN\".  When you open up the container... the aroma - reminded me of aroma of a visit to \"kennywood\" funnel cakes.. etc. I chose the chicken n waffle.. its two tenders cooked in the waffle.  I always inquire whats the most popular menu item - when ordering.   This was it baby.. and I can see why! 

The chicken tenders were fresh and bursting with flavor.  Plenty of dipping sauces to choose from - including syrup.. I went for the hot and spicy of course... jalapeno ranch and it was a wise choice on my part.. because it was so good!!!   Now I need nap! Thanks Coop Chicken and Waffles!"}
{"text":"This place is the nun's buns, guys. I stumbled upon this place at a food truck festival in Homestead. The weather was absolutely disgusting, but the chick-n-waffle 100% made up for it. If you don't know what you're ordering when you order it (like me), you think you will be getting chicken with waffles. NAY. You are getting a waffle with the delicious fried chicken MIXED IN THE WAFFLE BATTER. This is not a drill. It was awesome, and I will dream about it. I can only imagine everything else is just as good. Try it or regret it! Just kidding...but seriously."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high... the chicken breading was soggy and not crispy and was rather flavorless. The waffle was pretty average. I wish I had more to say but I don't. I chased this food truck around for 2 weeks trying to eat here and when I finally got there it was a pretty huge disappointment. I think if I blind folded an east end hipster who gave this place a 5 star review they would prefer Giant Eagle fried chicken over this place. Carmi on the North Side still holds the belt for chicken and waffles in Pgh."}
{"text":"Yee Haw! The Coop serves up great chicken and waffles. It's a food truck with a sense of humor. 

First off, the truck itself resembles a barn an the people inside are friendly and courteous. 

The chicken is delicious and contains no added hormones, or antibiotics. The Belgian waffles are tasty, too. They have a wide variety of syrups, honey and fruit toppings which are self-serve. 

Yes, it's a limited menu, however I'm a fan when the result is this good. 

Check their location on their website."}
{"text":"So I finally had me some CHICKEN AND WAFFLES honey!.... yes I did...  

Anyway... I went to that there Christmas light up night shin-dig and they had one of them there Coop Chicken and waffles trucks that there. 

It was good except for the rubbery egg I had on my waffle. They also had creative syrups like Siracha hot maple syrup which was the highlight of my dish.

Definitely a must try with the creative syrups."}
{"text":"You know when you have a craving for something you've had before and when you finally get it again it just didn't measure up to what your mind and taste buds had envisioned? Well, I was craving some Coop Chicken and waffles for weeks! Finally tracked them down today in the strip. Didn't even need to look at the menu. I ordered the Hen, 3 piece chicken tenders on a Belgian waffle. Well, let me just say that not only did it meet my expectations, it was even BETTER than I remembered. And last time I even had it with some fabulous Dancing Gnome IPA's. 

Look, I can't imagine how you get any better than this. Might just be the perfect indulgence. I don't know what they're doing in that truck, but as long as they continue, I'm gonna be looking to find them. Yeah, they're that good. The chicken isn't your typical tender. Nope. It's spectacular on its own. And the Belgian waffle? You have to taste it to believe it. Oh, and there is more than just your standard maple syrup. How about a Sriracha sauce that combines sweet and hot. Or maybe a jalapeño honey? Yeah, I'm talking some delightful options to complement this amazing dish. Trust me, you can't go wrong. And the people working the truck? Super friendly! What more could you want?

So if you see them around, try them. I'll probably be somewhere around with my belly full and a smile on my face."}
{"text":"I don't like chicken and waffles, but decided to try their dessert waffles. My cinnamon roll waffle was amazing! The service was fast and friendly, too."}
{"text":"We first met at the Monroeville Food Truck Convention.  It was  at first sight.  We hate being apart.  Wherever Food Truck goes, I will follow."}
{"text":"So, I don't mean to brag but a food truck right outside of my work selling chicken and waffles?!?! 
Long lines but worth the wait for sure.  I paid $9 for a giant Belgium waffle with 2 chicken tenders. For an extra dollar I got an egg on top. It was perfect for TWO people. Totally, wish I would have shared! 
The chicken had a spicy flavor in the batter and was so crispy and delish!
I can't wait until the The Coop food truck visits again!"}
{"text":"I have never had chicken and waffles before but I decided to try them after I have seen this truck at a few places around town. OMG... if I wouldn't gain 50 pounds I would eat this every day! The waffles are soft and the chicken is crispy with a kick of heat. I absolutely love their food!!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat chicken and waffles for many years now and today was the day... I got the Chick N Waffle which was delicious. It came with 2 chicken tenders baked into a Belgian waffle with an over easy egg deep fried which I broke so the yolk could splash over the waffle. It was down right delicious and the sriracha syrup was interestingly good!! I am definitely and big fan and hope to indulge in the future."}
{"text":"The Coop has become one of my favorite go-to food trucks! I've been here a few times now and somehow each time they manage to shatter my expectations! Just truly stepping up the bar to the next level! I decided to get a fried egg on \"The Chick\" which was 2 Chicken Tenders over a waffle with some Chipotle Sauce and Syrup! Anytime I see this truck around I'll stop and I'll definitely drive out of my way a bit to grab a bite too! If that wasn't enough, the workers are so friendly and can strike up a conversation in just about anything! Just an overall amazing experience!!"}
{"text":"I think I might be in love with a food truck. Sorry husband, but my new food truck boyfriend is slinging perfectly seasoned, expertly fried chicken tenders paired with slightly sweet, crispy-yet-soft waffles. Add a dash of hot sauce or maple syrup, or be bold and try their amazing sriracha syrup or jalapeno honey. Whatever combo of condiments you choose, this spicy-savory-sweet chicken 'n waffles dish is simply comfort food perfection.

I was too full to try their dessert waffles (apple pie or cinnamon roll were the offerings on the day I was there), but I'm pretty sure if I had, I would've immediately stowed away on board the truck and abandoned my current life in pursuit of nothing but chicken and waffles for the rest of my existence. 

Seriously, this is some good food. They do one thing, and they do it well. Go find them immediately, and please sneak me a waffle if you see me hiding somewhere nearby. Thanks in advance."}
{"text":"The first time I went to the The Coop, on a recommendation from a friend,  I was blown away. It was yummy! Chicken hot, crispy and juicy. I could not wait for the truck to come back to our office location. I would have given it a 5 Star rating then.

Fast forward a month and the truck is scheduled back from 11:20 - 2. Perfect for celebrating a friend's birthday lunch - which was planned for a week and a fav of the 4-5 attending. Sadly, I was held up until and didn't get to the truck until 1:15. 

When I arrived, the owner/cook announced to me and another lady in line that there were only 3 pieces of chicken left and she wasn't going to make anymore. She explained that she didn't make any money that day so she was going home. While I was standing there talking with her, 2 other people showed up (there are now 4 in line) and one said there were others coming at 1:30. She said she was done for the day. I reminder her that she was scheduled until 2 and that i knew our company lunch didn't even start til 1. She clearly was ready to go home. The waffle machine had already been turned off. So, I bought 2 of the 3 tenders and she had her helper turn the waffle machine back on to make my waffle and the one person left. 

When I sat down to eat my chicken it was dry. Seriously dry. I don't know how long it sat before I got there but it was dry and the waffle soggy. The flavor was fine but the texture and quality lacking. I would rate it a 2 or 3.

What tipped the scale for me was the attitude. I don't blame anyone for wanting to close on a bad day but, like any business, you post your hours and you suck it up. I ran into 2 others headed to the truck on my way back to the office. That means they just lost 5-6 customers that I know of and who knows how many would have come in the last 30 minutes. With that attitude, and the not so great lunch, I am barely rating this a 3. Not sure if I will give them another try."}
{"text":"Another thing that I'll be tweaking for all the time!! So I tracked down this food truck today and had the chicken waffle, (it has chicken fingers cooked inside the waffle) with sriracha syrup and a cinnamon roll waffle they were both soooo good! The chicken was crispy and seasoned perfectly and the waffles were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle! I'll definitely be stalking them now lol"}
{"text":"We tried the Coop Chicken and Waffles food truck a while back and haven't been able to stop thinking about their food ever since. I started following them on Facebook so we could see where they're going to be. Today we went to the Strip District just because they were there. The gal in the truck even remembered us! How cool is that? 

Their food is off the charts great! The Belgian waffle is crispy and perfectly holds its place with the beautifully seasoned and pretty sizable chicken breast pieces. They have maple syrup, sriracha maple syrup and a delectable jalapeño honey as some of the topping/dipping choices. That jalapeño honey, oh my my what a happy surprise that was. I got the Chick with 2 pieces of chicken and hubby got The Hen with 3 pieces. Last time I got The Chick 'N Waffle with pieces of chicken cooked right inside the waffle. All are incredibly tasty and pure perfection in a styrofoam container - it's a food truck, you need that. 

Yes, after round 2 I'm definitely upping my rating to 5 stars. Well deserved and we will come find you again soon!"}
{"text":"First time I ever ate waffles and refused to put syrup on them! I could not believe how sweet and moist they tasted. The chicken was a great size and the breading was crunchy and flavorful. This food truck goes without competition as #1 in Pittsburgh in my opinion 10-10 would recommend bomb.com"}
{"text":"Was this an okay meal? Yes. Was the waffle fluffy and the staff awesome? Also yes. Would I stand in line for thirty minutes again for it? Probably not. They are definitely waffle connoisseurs. They're fluffy, fresh, and flavorful. I got the chicken inside the waffle because I've never tried the two together and it doesn't get any more together than that. The chicken just tasted like they season it with salt and pepper. Me not eating beef or pork has left room for me to try lots of chicken and I didn't feel this one was cooked with love. I was expecting a salty and sweet combination and my taste buds were deprived of. But they don't skimp in the amount of waffle and chicken. I will give them that. They also didn't get flustered at the very long line."}
{"text":"Wow, One of the best chicken and waffles I have ever consumed.  The chicken is big, delicious, moist, tender and flavorful.  There is syrup, hot sauce, jalapeño honey (nice), sriracha syrup and at least one more that you can put in a small cup for dipping or drenching.  
You can find their location on the website.  The website also states that nothing is ever frozen and the chicken contains no added hormones, antibiotic or steroids."}
