{"text":"I love authentic mexican food and this is as good as it gets! Great new restaurant in a great location. Love the food! I had a combo meal and it was hot and delicious. The service was very friendly and the owners were there and very attentive. I'll be back and I'll be bringing my friends and family next time."}
{"text":"Took 20 mins to get our food and it was cold. Had to send it back and it seems like there is only one cook. I am sure I'm going to  wait another 20 mins to get my food. We told the girl no beans bc my BF is allergic to it and still beans on the plate. I won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"You know finding great Mexican food is really hard to find.  Being from California, AZ southwest style if Mexican food is different.  I do have to say though this carne asada burrito is freaking delicious!  Great flavor!  Most places want to impress you with the portion size,not here.  I don't know about you but I'll take quality over quantity any day.  Next time I'm around these parts I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here because we wanted to try it. They got my boyfriends order wrong even though it was just one of the combos. They fixed it for him though. Both his and my food was average, nothing special, I can't even say that it is authentic since. The food tastes bland and my neighbor's for is much better than theirs. Their prices are a bit high for the quality and amount of food they give also. Definitely will not being going back any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is super duper clean, and the salsa is tasty, but I cannot recommend. If you do go, do NOT get what they are trying to pass off as Carne Asada. It looked like prefabricated, prefrozen thin squares of \"tasteless, school cafeteria mystery-meat\". What a shame because I was so excited to try this restaurant out."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great price on fish tacos on Friday.  Tucked away in a far corner of the plaza so look around the corner or you won't find it."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner!! We had the 2 enchilada plate, green chile plate, and the chile relleno plate   All were delicious as usual. There food has a slight kick to it which you can kick it up with the tabletop salsas. Please eat here. We want this restaurant to stay around a long time. Dinner for three with drinks and chips $28."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here one evening.  I had the #2 taco & cheese enchilada, my husband had the #10 two soft carne asada tacos.  The Food was delicious!  We joined the clean plate club and plan to return, again.  We were also impressed with the red salsa which had a solid kick to it, but not too much.  I just wanted to add that the restaurant was clean and they are open daily from 6am to 10pm."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever. Incredible staff. Comfy atmosphere. Refreshing escape from Chains. Mom and pop feel."}
{"text":"Ew, this does NOT taste like real Mexican food! If I had brought my abuela there she would have beat me with her chancla! 
My man and I ended up with food poisoning, we didn't order the same thing nor did we share food. I was able to peel off the \"cheese\" from the enchilada- like a piece of tape!!"}
{"text":"They definitely live up to their name. I had the two cheese enchilada combo. The right amount of cheese, and the sauce was right. Some places have a sweet red sauce, which is wrong. Beans and Spanish rice were properly seasoned. I also got a shredded beef taco, the meat was great but not enough."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant. The service was great and the food was delicious. Being from California, I hadn't found a place in Arizona that had good menudo. The menudo here was fantastic. It wasn't greasy and had the perfect amount of flavor. I also got a carne asada burrito to have later in the day and was just as happy with that. The burrito comes with rice and beans in it and had the perfect amount of carne asada in it too. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed several things from this place, however my husband is a different subject, either his order is wrong or when trying something new the meat seems very chewy.  the carne burro's are great, fish tacos are tasty, good enchiladas, along with great breakfast burritos.  Great staff :)    

It seems when we order late in the day that things are not as fresh.  My husband ordered steak fajitas, it was tasty but the meat was way too chewy, hope next time is more tender for him.    I have a few friends that have said the same thing late in the day things are not as fresh as lunch.  Hope this is helpful for the business and hope it changes.   I look forward to trying other things from here."}
{"text":"Enjoyed everything!  Especially salsa that is reminiscent of salsa in Mexico. Will come back Friday for fish tacos. That will be the real test. Watch for updates"}
{"text":"I don't know about authentic. I guess it depends on what part of Mexico. But it really doesn't matter because everything is really good. Especially enjoy the enchilada sauce and the green salsa."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the food at all. I had the meat and bean chimi. It was basically a huge enchilada as in was drowning in red sauce. The flour tortilla wasn't even crispy.

On a whole I won't be visiting here again. The lady at the counter was rude, and every time she tried to take my order she was interrupted by the cook.

The restaurant is very clean. The service was quick but I'm not sold on the food."}
{"text":"The food isn't awful but I got charged 2x for one meal and they wouldn't just reimburse me or take it off our next meal. They wanted bank statements and kept saying it was pending after like 11 days. Said it happened to other people and if treated the same way I'm sure they lost more customers. Would rather go to the Taco Bell in the same parking lot for same food, less money and not paying twice."}
{"text":"came her on December 30, 2014.  service was good and come to find out the the place has only been here a few months.  Ordered the egg/chorizo breakfast burrito an d it was awesome. Also order the carne asada burrito for my wife and it was a hit. The enchilada combo plates for my two kids were also a good value and had very good flavor. Would have given them a 4.5 but that is not available here. I wish them the best of luck and I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and was not disappointed! I had two enchiladas with red sauce and they were pretty filling. I love mexican food and will definitely be coming back! The girl who helped us was really nice and the environment was clean!"}
{"text":"Stopped in again since we were in the area. Carne asada burrito was good with a lot of carne asada. Meat was overcooked but not dry. Salsas were good with a nice range of mild to spicy   Carnitas tacos were flavorful but also tad dry, the green salsa made them perfect. 

For the reviewers who complained about paying for chips and salsa, they charge $1 for a decent basket filled with tortillas and homemade salsa. Seriously....totally worth the money if you are desiring chips. 

Only unfortunate item for me is, I only drink water and tea. They only have soda style raspberry tea, which is way too fake tasting for me. Luckily I had a bottle of water in the car. 

The server was young and lacked much personality but she answered questions for us. My guess is that she's shy. Overall we would give it a 3.5 but rounded up to 4 since that's not an option."}
{"text":"Excellent - clean and quick!
I forgot to mention the food is Awesome!
Great littler take-out joint!
Taco tuesday's Here you GO!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this little place! The menu might be somewhat limited but what they do have is down right YUMMO! The Cheese Enchiladas have such a great flavor, I find I just want more and more. 

Tonight I tried the Fish and Carne Asada Tacos and was NOT disappointed. Great sauce on the Fish Taco with a squeeze of fresh lime was most pleasing to the taste buds.

In the past I have also tried the Green Chili Chimichanga as well as the Carne Asada Burrito. I just want to share this place with everyone and the pricing is more than fair! Definitely worth a try and then come back for more!"}
{"text":"I'm not one for hidden fees. Was not told the coke bottled drink was $2.50, as sign says $1.99 for bottled drinks. So I was not happy to see I was charged $2.50. I would have gotten it regardless, it's the misrepresentation. 
First time here not impressed with the flavors. Nothing special about the Menudo,  was bland, taste better at Ranch Market. Although the enchilada wasn't to my sons liking, i liked that sauce was homemade.  I may come back to try them....but not the menudo."}
{"text":"Authentic home made Mexican food! Love how they have that family vibe! Very friendly!"}
{"text":"For a little strip mall, fast food restaraunt, Enchiladas is the real deal. Initially skeptical, we traded our usual trip to Giants Burgers to try Enchiladas. Authentic Mexican food. Not a culinary adventure by any means but well worth a stop to get an authentic home style type dish. The Menudo is well done. Tamales are actually pretty decent. Tacos are good. The chilaquilles are awesome! Mom and pop shop. Nothing fancy but clean eatery."}
{"text":"Food was ok I thought it was a bit pricey for what it was . We ordered a chorizo burrito and a chorizo plate . Had to pay for chips and salsa, even though we ate there. I don't know about authentic ! We will not be returning ."}
{"text":"Terrible service, girl that works front counter is extremely rude. Food took Forever. So many good Mexican food restaurants nearby that treat you like they appreciate your business. Will not be back."}
{"text":"The lady at the counter was rude. She was on her phone when we walked in and finished up her conversation like we weren't even there. Then instead of a greeting she started with \"are you ready to order yet?\" When our food came up, she was on the phone again so it sat for a couple minutes. We walked up to get it ourselves. The food itself was disgusting. There was practically no chorizo in my CHORIZO burrito and it tasted like they opened up a can of beans and threw it in cold. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on impulse. Did not disappoint. The Huevos Rancheros is amazing. The sauce is very tasty. The service was excellent as well. Food was brought to our table, along with piping hot tortillas. Would come back for sure"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place for Sunday menudo. I get it regularly and it's always deliecious!"}
{"text":"Great food... Love their Albondigas and menudo on the weekend is best I can find in this area. Also great customer service!"}
{"text":"I ordered the cheese enchilada combo. I got very nervous when I heard the microwave used three times and I was the only one in the restaurant. The beans were good. The tortillas in the enchiladas didn't taste like they had ever been in the oven. They were mushy and undercooked. The sauce tasted like Las Palmas. The rice was very strange. I didn't eat any more after one bite. I think it had been sitting in the refrigerator too long or something, and looked like couscous. There's too much good Mexican food in the valley to eat mediocre stuff."}
{"text":"Good food, authentic taste, friendly staff, and very well priced! A gem Hidden in plain site"}
{"text":"Was here for a company lunch... Decent food and ambience is very authentic Mexican... I ordered fish tacos which was good but it had a fish bone which got stuck in my throat ... I had to go to urgent care to get it removed later on... I can't imagine that this was not taken care of by the chef... Horrible experience as it did not work in my favor... My colleagues were upset as well as we did not expect this kind of problems to arise in a restaurant of such high caliber."}
{"text":"We were excited to try somewhere new. Sadly this wasn't the right choice to keep that excitement alive. 
The Good/Neutral: The chicken taquitos and chile relleno were pretty tasty. The rice, beans, cheese crisp and enchilada was standard. 
The Not Good: other foods were not so good. The fries were terrible (luckily our son still ate some). Also, they had small portions that don't justify the prices. $4.50 for a tortilla and cheese (cheese crisp which was actually a quesadilla)? $3.50 for a half bag of chips? Speaking of chips, that brings me to another negative: the service. They forgot to give us our overpriced chips and so my husband drove all the way back over there. They didn't offer anything for the inconvenience. Nothing extra. Not even an apology. 

End summary: stick to someburros or even Filibertos for quick Mexican food. Pass on this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and service, and the cleanest place I have been to in the area, very nice I loved the enchiladas.  Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a bowl of menudo, which may tell some of you how my Saturday night went - but that's another story!  It's a small restaurant that is located in a strip mall.  And, as is often the case, these type of locations have hidden gems that might get overlooked.  I was greeted with a warm hello, and I immediately noticed how clean the place was.  I ordered the Menudo Grande and a bottled water (again, Saturday night!).  I sat down, and minutes later my order came out in a real bowl, with a real & big soup spoon. No plastic here, which is fantastic.  I added lime, cilantro, and some red pepper flakes into the bowl.  I found it to be delicious, and when I was done I was ready to leave Saturday night in the dust and start my Sunday.  I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, you definitely have to check this place out! The restaurant is super clean and the customer service is awesome. I usually get the carne asada tacos or burrito which I definitely recommend.  If you stop by on the weekend try the menudo! Always yummy never greasy."}
{"text":"My wife and I were really in the mood for enchiladas when we saw the restaurant and thought why not. My beef enchiladas were really good, but my wifes chicken enchiladas were better. The salsa was very fresh and so good. It was a good spur of the moment choice."}
{"text":"Clerk was very pleasant, place very clean.  The food was pretty good and would come again."}
{"text":"Authentic its definitely not. However its pretty good for what it is. Not the greatest but by no means the worst. I had the taco and tostada plate. i didn't really like the rice but everything else was pretty good. The service was quick and the restaurant was very clean. I think its a family restaurant so that was nice. My only complaint is that chips and salsa isn't complimentary but thats okay. Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Great alternative to Filib's and such... I've eaten in a couple of times and the lady (owner I assume) was super nice and the establishment was clean."}
{"text":"Was in the area unexpectedly and looking for a quick lunch. Came by this small place in a grocery store strip mall and it was great.

This is real Mexican food. I ordered the chips and salsa and a taco/enchilada combo plate. The salsa was mild but fresh, the chips were fine but nothing great. My combo was very flavorful. I used the rest of my chips with the beans.  They have two taco sauces to use and tried both. The green was a little sweet for me so I mostly used the red.  

Will be back next time I am in the area. If you live near by, lucky for you."}
{"text":"I wonder where some of these reviews have ate real authentic mexican food. I can tell you one thing it sure is not here. My wife and I ordered the enchilada combos. Mine beef, hers chicken. The beef taste like something out of a can. While there I noticed there was a large can of red  sauce, La Palma or something like that. Have seen it in grocery stores. The tortillas were horrible also. There s nothing authentic about this place except the Spanish speaking employees."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch and the food was fantastic for this price point.  We ordered the cheese enchiladas, tamales, green chili burro with red sauce, rice and beans.  It was really great with the chips and salsa along with the red and green hot sauce.  They were all very good.  I was very happy with what we ordered.  The owners really took pride in the food and the service that they provided and that was appreciated.  I would highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Not particularly good or bad. Just another fast Mexican food place that you can easily drive by and not notice it. I had a chicken burrito that did not impress. The place is clean and the owner seems nice. But unless I'm absolutely craving Mexican food for some strange reason,  I'll probably just drive by."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos here are bomb!  Definitely going to come back again! Super nice owner as well!"}
{"text":"First and last time eating food from this place. Ordered a carne Assad burrito, 4 tacos, and 4 rolled tacos. Got home and started to eat my burrito and found a \"toothpick\" inside. So I am thinking why is there a toothpick in my food and gross who used this toothpick? When I called to inform the establishment about the toothpick the employee was not surprised. He will however let the cook know about the toothpick and will gladly make me a new burrito. No thanks I am not into eating foreign objects hidden in my food. I think my money should be refunded but this was not offered. Had to go to Taco Bell for dinner."}
{"text":"I'm really liking the chorizo and egg breakfast burrito!  Quite tasty! I'd like to see a little more on the plate, like a side of fruit or some type of delightful side to \"finish\" the plate.  But taste wise, it's up there!  We'll have to make a return trip for tacos.  Can't wait to check out the menu :)"}
