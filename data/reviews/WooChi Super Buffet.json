{"text":"Well -- that was quick....

I wrote my review for Woo Chi in March of this year.  We'd had a pretty good experiences there after the remodel and up to that time.

Since then it has already gone down-hill FAST!

We started noticing that the entrees were not kept warm -- and would often be cold by the time we got to the table.

And ALL the chicken in every chicken entree was dry and over-cooked and very chewy -- sometimes we wondered if Woo Chi was putting out food from the day before and just microwaving it and putting it back out.

Lastly I love putting hot mustard on their egg-rolls. The mustard used to be HOT but now it is not hot at all -- like they're stretching it with something that isn't hot mustard.

Anyway -- after all this happening 3 or 4 times in a row -- the last time we went we both agreed would be our last -- until they're under new management or remodel again etc.

BTW -- the staff there are generally friendly and nice -- so it's sad to see the place take a dive so soon.

---------------------------

3/9/2017:     We used to go here when it was Eastern Buffet and now have been a couple of times since the remodel.

Everything I've tried so far is pretty good (an improvement over when it was Eastern)--and the buffet tables are always kept well stocked.    

I haven't tried the Mongolian BBQ--so I can't comment on that.

The staff is reasonably friendly and the waitresses/waiters are generally attentive--or fairly easy to flag down if you need something.

We've only been for dinner so far and it has become a lot more expensive (I think it's $14.95 per person).

I considered giving Woo Chi 3 Stars for that price--but decided the food was good enough to raise that to 4.

We'll give lunch a try soon and see if that makes it more affordable--and will update then."}
{"text":"Beautiful renovation. Food was good. All that money to renovate and they didn't do the bathrooms. They are the same disgusting bathrooms as before. Why would you not do the bathrooms when they are so important?  I would assume the kitchen was not touched either. Won't be back. Sorry."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and good! Service was attentive! Above average buffet for a good price!"}
{"text":"I am in Mesa from Chicago, my three kids took me for lunch today. We had phone coupons for 15% off the meal (or) 2 for lunch at $14.99.  They would not accept our coupon, or that of a neighboring table, they had printed coupons. Only coupons from the newspaper, then why have it on-line? Ridiculous! Good food, very clean, but kind of a disappointing finish to our meal. They need to work on the marketing!!"}
{"text":"UNBELIEVABLE.  

We used to go to #1 Eastern Buffet (now WooChi Buffet) up to three times a week.  

We recently went later on a week night, 1 1/4 hour before their posted closing hour.   

The food trays were empty, or almost empty...

The \"FOOD\" (IF ANY) looked like congealed GLOP....  

GLOP: GOOEY SLOP.  

The servers were racing around removing dirty dishes and wiping down tables...

No attention to us at all after delivering glasses of water, 

Water glasses delivered with dirty, wet hands from cleaning tables.  EEK!

As our dishes piled up the servers raced around FRANTICALLY, 

Wiping with DIRTY cloths, Pushing Chairs Around, Sweeping Filthy Floors.... 

SWEEPING!!!!?  SWEEPING the floors next to and even under our feet!!!!

Meanwhile owners / managers sat amid the mess tallying up the day's receipts?!?

THE FLOORS (NEW TILE FLOORING HORRIBLE MISTAKE) FILTHY, DISGUSTING!!!

No mopping was seen, floors looked like a herd of cows gave birth on them!!!

We couldn't believe this experience!!!!  GROSS!!!!

As we left I asked to speak to the owner or the manager or SOMEONE INVESTED

Some dopey guy came to the register and I told him WE WILL NEVER BE BACK!!!

I told him if he wanted to be closed at NINE ON THE DOT or whatever...

THEY SHOULD CLOSE AT 8 or 8:30.... 

NOT HAVE EVERYONE SCURRYING AROUND WIPING, SWEEPING FILTH!

DISGUSTING FLOORS NEEDING TO BE MOPPED NIGHTLY....

But NOT ON RESTAURANT CUSTOMER'S TIME!!!!  

They brought in an elegant wine thingy at the entry.... 

BUT WHO WANTS A GLASS OF WINE WITH THEIR AIRBORNE FILTH?

They replaced individual scoops of a QUALITY ICE CREAM...

With CHEAP crappy frozen yogurt!!!

WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?!?!?!  

INSANITY.... UNSANITARY INSANITY!!!!

I had gotten FOOD POISONING here once, BEFORE THIS REMODEL!!!!  

The Manager / Owner / Whatever he was.... 

All he had to say was \"Our buffet is CHEAPER than others!!!!!\"????? 

RUN.  Don't Walk.... RUN!!!!  Or GET the RUNS!!!! 

WE ARE DONE WITH THIS PLACE.  

COLOR US GONE, GONE, GONE.

Too Bad.  Bad.  BAD.  BAD, BAD, BAD!!!!  

G-O-N-E."}
{"text":"Great buffet. The food isn't greater than any other buffet but the variety of options is. Interior is nice too, doesn't look like the bare minimum decoration you'll see at some Chinese buffets. Only complaint is the lack of toppings for the yogurt machine. I did the lunch buffet, I can only imagine the dinner spread to be better. Would recommend for sure."}
{"text":"Yummy! 
You certainly get your money's worth, hubby and I had dinner on a Saturday evening. 

About 12.99 per person our total bill came out to 32.00 which was with tax included.

Sushi, seafood, crab, shrimp, fried seafood, deserts, raw fish, soup, egg rolls! Huge selection to choose from."}
{"text":"I love the new beautiful designs that they did to the restaurant. The food was decent for a buffet. There are many choices of food. The service was good for a buffet. The waitress always had our plates taken away when we were finished eating. None of our drinks were empty because she would keep giving us refills. I would most likely return with my family again."}
{"text":"Food offerings were delicious. Sushi & rolls offered here were decent. Pork buns were awesome. Service was nice, booths/tables were stained. This place gets VERY busy. Hopefully they clean the stained booths."}
{"text":"Eaten at quite a few buffet places but none this good! Staff was super polite and food was excellent! Really surprised by the variety and quality of the food, especially the sushi. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came for lunch and honestly we left satisfied. The food was good and we tought that the lunch price was alright. I loved the variety of sushi."}
{"text":"Amazing buffet with lots of options.  Always hot and fresh choices.  I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Very Good buffet 
Clean,friendly staff
Fresh food Lots of variety 
Only negative thing to say is that their fountain  soda has that Mesa water smell to it.
Other than that it's a great place to eat.
For lunch all you can eat cost 23.50 for two people with all the soda and food you can eat.
Highly recommended 
Will go back soon."}
{"text":"Wow!! We went there for lunch today on the recommendation of a waitress in the area. Clean! Huge selection! Reasonable prices. The best restaurant I've been to since moving to the valley 18 mos ago. Besides the food bars they have Mongolian BBQ, and a large selection of sushi."}
{"text":"Food was great came in for lunch...first time here...the interior is nice...waiter service was prompt...but as any Chinese buffet their not social...there is no beef n broccoli..but chicken n broccoli...food was fresh and very tasty...had a nice selection of sushi and Mongolian grill is always a hit with me...
8.99 FOR LUNCH????  That Is A Great Price...
This Is Gonna Be One Of My Favorite Places For Lunch...Gonna try The Dinner Soon..."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in the area.  Very large selection including a Sushi bar and kept fresh. Also, everything including the restroom is very clean."}
{"text":"I don't even understand why and how this place has bad reviews. It's so pretty inside. The food is awesome. I've never seen it dirty at all and I've always had awesome service. 

We probably go to this place like once a month. It's really nice and worth the cost."}
{"text":"I'm here now the sewer smell from the bathroom is nauseating ... I've killed flies at my table and the floor is sticky under neath my feet... would not stay if it wasn't my husbands bday .. don't want to ruin his day"}
{"text":"Kids wanted Chinese buffet for dinner, so I yelped some options. We chose this place based on the reviews. There is a nice chinese food selection available including crab legs, sushi bar, and Mongolian grill. Most the food items were hot, others lukewarm. The food was ok, not that good- pretty typical of average buffets. Some of the foods had a strange cigarette ash taste. They have a big dessert selection, and service was good."}
{"text":"I took the wife here after a recommendation from a friend and I'm glad I did. The variety of food including sushi was far better than any other buffet. We got there at 11:20am and they were starting to get busy, by noon it was almost packed but the large area made it nice to move around. If something was out, they were very fast about getting it filled right away as they have someone waking around and checking. Once out a guy has a Mic for the cooks line and once in a while you can hear him tell the cooks to make stuff. Oh btw 2 buffets and I had a soda and the wife had a water and it came to 25 bucks AFTER TIP! All in all I was pleased and will be going back."}
{"text":"Clean! Big selection, crab legs on Sunday, sushi all week. Sushi very good for a buffet, fresh but small selection."}
{"text":"No. 
Just awful. 
I wasn't very impressed by this place when it was under the other name,  but now,  they're just dreadful. 
There were black things floating in my soda as if my glass had never been washed.  When I pointed it out to the waitress she gave me attitude. 
The quality of their food is incredibly lacking.  Their Mongolian grill meat is bathed in some sort of beige meat goo,  and even after they've added seasoning it tastes as bland as eating paper. 
The ambiance is much nicer than before,  but it's obvious they redecorated at the expense of better quality food. 
Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"A cut above your typical Chinese buffet. Popular with locals and the senior set. 20-minute wait for a table before 6:00 pm, but good humor in the line. Wait staff attentive and polite, even when they try to wisk away a plate from which you haven't yet finished. Good selection of old favorites plus some you don't see enough, like Mongolian beef. Sushi also popular, but ribeye steak from Hibachi grill was kinda tough. Clean place with fresh food brought out regularly. Soft-serve ice cream machine, but only dishes and no cones (*sigh*). Place has liquor license, and some of the wine offerings seemed pretty reasonable. Prices seemed good, but there is a posted two-hour maximum (sorry Homers). Like many restaurants in the  Mesa/Phoenix area, closing times on the weekend (9:30 pm) seemed early to this East Coaster. Will go again!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre food, first and last visit. Neither wife or i enjoyed the food, still looking for good oriental food in mesa."}
{"text":"When I rate this a 5, I'm rating it for what it is, a Chinese food buffet. Very clean, fresh food, attentive yet unobtrusive staff, yummy food, no MSG or trans fat, reasonable prices, big selection and interesting decor. This is a safe bet."}
{"text":"Very clean and food is kept fresh and hot!  Pluses for any buffet, especially an Asian buffet. Great place to go if you want to try a number of different dishes. Servers are extremely attentive, as well."}
{"text":"I went there when it by the old name, probably same owner, did see the same hostess, short on food, snow crab legs, did not stay long"}
{"text":"I could not agree more with that guy down a couple comments Justin.P  for the price it was well worth it. I would go for lunch again any time"}
{"text":"I asked if they take competitor coupons because the old buffet did, but they said no. That's when I should've walked out. The woman ringing up a to go order stated with an attitude that there were no tables available & that I'd have to wait. I saw a table being cleaned so I let her know that one was opening up. When I was seated I told the server that I wanted a water with no ice, & she brings me one with ice. I had a walker with me & one male employee moved the walker so he could get a cart by, but then didn't put it back. The food was mediocre, & I had to spit out part of the dumpling & pot sticker because they seemed undercooked. Unless they put coupons in the paper, I will most likely not come back to pay $13 + tax for poor food & poorer service."}
{"text":"Food good and fresh , place is clean . Very attentive servers/cleaners , will deffineyly come back here  next time"}
{"text":"Great food, But could be a more warm. I Would recommend eating there! Great have this fear and very clean."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Buffet food in general, but this one is better than the average. Food is fresh. Mongolian bar, sushi and desserts.
Prices are normal, service is fast and attentive. The place was reopened last January,  so everything looks nice, clean."}
{"text":"This is the best buffet in Mesa. My daughter and i eat here at least once a month and the food is amazing. the tables and decor creates a great atmosphere and minus a couple of the workers everyone is very nice. I am so glad this was built so close to home and we have seen the growth just in the last few months, so now i needed to spread the word. Woo Chi is the best!"}
{"text":"Not the cleanest place toe at in. Every where you go there is dirty tables and serving areas. Crab legs are the worst i have every seen. Broken up bits and pieces in the crab leg tray. No decent ones to pick from..Water in tray looked dirty. Food on the buffet tables were cold and I throw out most that I tried to eat. Poor service. I would not recommend this pace to anyone. What a sad thing to behold. I don't see them being in the business that long. Steer clear of this place and save your money and go somewhere else that cares about you and that you eat."}
{"text":"Decent price. Bland ,partially hot , clean but just not impressed I probably would not return here not because anything was done I just like I said was not impressed all of the courses were very similar and nothing really stood out but I mean for like a $9 Chinese food buffet and basically Southwest AJ what do you want"}
{"text":"As far as Chinese buffets go, this is a good one. It's very American. It's always busy. There are always tons of snowbirds.

All that aside, it's always clean. The staff is always attentive and thankful for your business. I like that there are good sushi options, and Char Siu Bao, Dou Sha Bao, seaweed, octopus and sweet coconut dumplings. The old folk usually aren't rushing those tables, so I get what I want. 

The buffet also has all of your usual buffet fare, with a Mongolian grill, hot dishes, desserts, salads and stuff like soup, pizza and even a chocolate fountain. I am wary of the chocolate fountain's sanitation. How many Augustus Gloops have floated in there? As tempting as warm, flowing chocolate is, I can't. I am a sucker for the sugar peanuts though! 

I feel like such a glutton when I'm here, but we all need one of those days a time or two! I do just enough to feel satisfied, and grab only what I know that I love. If you're being bad, make it worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"I like this buffet, I feel the food here tastes better than other buffers around. The food seems to be coming out fresh. There is a man that stands at the window to change the food out."}
{"text":"I had weight loss surgery in January. 
After a family funeral, the family wanted to go here to eat. 
I asked if it was possible to pay a reduced price as I would only be able to eat a few pieces of fruit. I even had a card from my surgeon's office explaining my surgery and the fact that I can't eat regular portions. 
I was told they do not accept the card and that I would have to pay full price even if I just ate the fruit. 
I refused to give them full price, so I got to sit and watch my family eat. 
I will not be returning and will strongly advise others to avoid, especially those who have had wls."}
{"text":"Love this buffet!! Love all the fresh seafood and its 7 mins away from home!  The crabs and all the dumplings are really good. Must try!"}
{"text":"This is a very clean kind of upscale Chinese buffet, food was better than most Chinese buffets, not so generic. Hostess was kind of a dick, he said he would seat us and never did... a waitress instead did, after asking to be be seated. Our waitress rocked! Very good with keeping our table clean of plates and getting refills. Very recommendable."}
{"text":"This place is not better than when it was #1 Eastern Chinese Buffet.  It got remodeled in the restaurant area (though the bathrooms were still kind of dumpy) but the food is the same.  We went on Sunday night around 4:45.  They are very unorganized or something as it takes a long a time to get seated and there were plenty of empty tables.  There was not enough wait staff or bussers and it seemed like they didn't know what they were doing.  The whole while we were there there was at least 10 people waiting to get in, again not for lack of seating.  I can live with that for now.  The food though was the same, a fair assortment but most of it was tepid.  The crab legs are still very small as well.  I mentioned the warm food to the manager? but he didn't seem to really care.  They did not adjust the bill or even apologize.  I doubt we will go back.  For $13.99 per person it's just not worth it.  The new Mongolian Grill in Apache Junction was much better for the money and everything was hot.  We will go back there."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and so worth the price. I've eaten twice with my family. Worth the drive too. We travel 30 minutes to eat there too. The only buffet I will tip 20%."}
{"text":"WooChi provides a good selection of items. Options for those who may not like Chinese and want some American style foods are also available. 
Their food does have plenty of flavor to all of it. I usually try a little bit if everything when visiting buffets. I have been here about 9 times. 
The sushi bar has a decent selection and is always fresh. 
They have a great fruit bar with watermelon, peaches, grapes, etc.
They have a Mongolian grill available. 
A soft serve yogurt machine. 
The cold mussels are never debearded and it is annoying having to pull the beard out and get jalepeno and other toppings all over your hands. Better than leaving the beard and ruining the taste I guess. 
The peel-n-eat shrimp is always perfectly cooked.
They have updated their cocktail sauce and it is a much better blend of sweet and spice. 
Desserts are the typical affair macaroons, lemon cake, chocolate cake, cookies, they do have a chocolate fountain. 
I like both their egg drop and hot and sour soup. 
Chicken wings actually have the hair fully removed, sadly the meat in the wings is usually overcooked and dried blood pockets in them. 
I do love that they offer both spring rolls and egg rolls. 
The entree dishes are restocked quickly. 
Overall another average buffet. Unfortunately this area doesn't have another option for a Chinese buffet within 8-10 miles of here."}
{"text":"Really liked everything I tried..the Sushi bar was very good..only suggestion would be to add more choices for the desert bar and more beverage choices, but the food is very good."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what this food was, but it wasn't very good if it was supposed to be Chinese."}
{"text":"If you're looking for lots of delicious seafood, this is the place.  After 4:00 the crab legs are added to the clams, fish and shrimp on the menu.  It's not all seafood.  There was also roast beef, chicken, Chinese, sushi and even a Mongolian BBQ.

The choices are great.  The food fresh and delicious.  We really like visiting this place but so do so many others.  The price is about the most reasonable around for a seafood buffet.

Love it!"}
{"text":"Re-open under a new name and new ownership

The food is very fresh and delicious and the service is excellent and we really enjoy it.
They have the freshest Sushi and Sashimi of most buffets"}
{"text":"I hadn't come here in a while. Last time I came it was called something different. It was 1 Eastern Buffet. Now it has been completely remodeled and looks very nice. The price went up The food is also very good just like it was before. Recommend this place for anyone looking for a good Chinese Buffet in East Mesa."}
{"text":"The remodel is nice! The food is fresh and good. Customer service is good no complaints. Must try place"}
{"text":"This Buffet is so good. We hadn't been as before it was bought and renovated it was a Chinese Buffet but it was NOT good, it even had good violations ... so we were reluctant to try WooChi's. It was a great surprise to us that the food at Woochi's is excellent and it's constantly being refilled and the quality is very good. The restaurant and washroom are clean as well. The selection of dishes are many and the sushi bar is great, the grill is an added bonus and very good and the dessert bar is awesome. You will be happy if you choose the Buffet, it will NOT disappoint. Prices are decent and they will give 10% for seniors or if you're lucky enough to get coupons in a newspapers you get 15%. They will only give one discount. 
Cheers and thumbs up for WooChi's...
Enjoy"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's not perfect but it is clean, very well priced, good assortment of food and they're doing their best"}
{"text":"Extreme food poisoning is best way to explsin this food. Undercooked, cold, old, food and for Fathers day you git the special of paying full dinner price all day long to puke your guts out."}
{"text":"Food here is fresh and it also has a sushi bar, which not many Chinese buffets have.  The main reason I came to this one is for that, but was pleasantly surprised that their main Chinese dishes were fresh and flavorful.  Sushi was great!  California rolls and Las Vegas rolls were fantastic, especially since you could get as many as you wanted!  Place is moderately priced, but is worth it."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time earlier this week and it was absolutely delicious.  Normally kind of leery about Chinese food buffet is as most of the food is old and they always seem to be staring you down to see if you're wasting food. This buffet is different they had great atmosphere great Decour and the food was some of the best I've had at a Chinese buffet in my life"}
{"text":"This place came recommended. The food was all fresh and excellent with a wide selection including fresh sushi. The price was more than reasonable...under $20 for dinner. Definitely above the average buffet."}
{"text":"Was really excited about this place because of the large sushi election they present at their buffet; unfortunately, large selections do not equate to great food. The food was mediocre. Not great, not super fresh - just meh. Our server was awesome but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great meals, beautiful decor, fresh food. We've taken local & visiting friends and family and they were all impressed. The youngsters love the choices. Another plus is the way the serving tables are designed with plenty of room & no lines."}
{"text":"Best buffet I've been to in years.    What a gem

Big selection of food and fresh also"}
{"text":"The food was alright, just the same as every other Chinese buffet. And of course, they have their dinner prices; which you would HAVE to pay even if you don't eat the crab legs, ect. So what did I have? I had: Egg Drop Soup, Shrimp with Celery, Chicken Wings, Crab Legs w/ Melted Butter, Water and a Diet Pepsi. When you don't grub a whole lot, expect to pay a lot anyway. 

As far as the service, it wasn't that good, which was probably my fault. I was dining alone so I brought and wore my headphones when eating. My waitress probably didn't want to bother me while I was into my movie when eating. I only spoke to her once for my check.

Atmosphere? I didn't like how the place felt crammed (where I was sitting). Yes, there was a lot of people there for the dinner rush, but I never like how buffets stuff so many tables and chairs so close-together-back-to-back. It's annoying sometimes.

Yes, the decor makes the place appear upscale, but with all the cramming, it's a bit uneasy when you're trying to dine comfortable. Would I go back? Probably not. They won't miss me. Just as long as their back-to-back tables and chairs are filled...."}
