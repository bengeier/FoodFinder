{"text":"The Dugout is no Old Timers (former name). It has been completely remodeled and is clean, bright and family friendly. The food is fresh, not frozen, and is delicious.  Everything is house made. Don't let the exterior dissuade you. This place is excellent!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Guaranteed the best Wings around!  All their food including Philly Steak Sandwiches, Hamburgers, Meat Ball Subs (Sliders) are so good and very reasonably priced.  
The place under the previous owner was called the Old Timers and quite frankly was not very nice.  However, this all changed when the current owners completely renovated and remodeled the bar and grill to give it a baseball theme--hence the name The Dugout!  It's now very clean and attractive looking inside and for sure kid friendly.   I personally love their Jumbo size chicken wings! yummy, yummy! I have been back numerous times with friends and family  and never have been disappointed!  They are currently open for lunch and dinner Tuesday through Saturday.  However, I believe their opening days are about to change so you might want to call them at 704 821 4553 to be sure.   Oh yes, they do carryout also!  I can only  hope they get the support they need to stay open because it's a nice alternative to other lesser bar and grills in the area."}
