{"text":"The food was homemade and fresh; however, was disappointed the Roast Leg of Lamb was well done and dry. Was also disappointed two of my orders were sold out, the Lamb Chops and Sausage appetizer. It was a Sunday night dinner for three birthday celebrations. Would think twice about returning again."}
{"text":"Just tonight I was craving for Greek food, went through a frantic search for this restaurant, as a result I can't believe this restaurant is closed! Definitely my go-to spot for lamb chops and roe dip every pre-music hall concert, Danforth would probably never be the same for me without it. So here's a harsh lesson for me taking this gem for granted. Please open soon, I can't bare without having the best roe (taramasalata) in the city :'("}
{"text":"I hate taking chances with new restaurants because I'm so frequently disappointed, but not this time! I'm mean the last time I ordered in spanakopita (from a different place) whatever arrived was inedible and full on gooey cheese and not much else. Avli's spanakopita, on the other hand, isn't in filo, but the pastry was light and crunchy and the filing perfect. Food arrived piping hot (delivery dude apologized for being late, but I'm pretty sure he wasn't), the greek salad was fresh and tasty (although a bit of vinegar in the dressing never killed anyone). Moussaka is also very tasty and well spiced. It's a rare day when I finish a delivery meal feeling genuinely satisfied, meaning Avli's my new go-to when I'm in the mood for Greek.

My only disappointment was that I didn't take a chance on the saganaki (my favorite!). When restaurants mess that one up, they tend to do so spectacularly, so I decided to hold off. I'm pretty sure this place will get it right though."}
{"text":"We went to Avil for a late lunch while on the Danforth after walking by. Something drew us in, it wasn't the red butcher paper on the table. ha ha 

The owner presented us with a $15 three course menu and a big smile. The selection was great, I dare anyone to find something that they wouldn't like to order on the lunch menu. 

The food was great & there was so much food that we ended up getting a doggie bag!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant & authentic Greek food. Prices are very reasonable. I had the octopus.  The best I ever had.....even better than the one I had in Greece. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are in TO"}
{"text":"We have been to many restaurants on the Danforth and this is one of the top choices.  There dips are amazing and can be a meal them self.  There lamb and chicken were perfect and the potatoes out of this world.  Great wine selection also. Over we feel you can't go wrong with this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place what's with the low reviews and low ratings? One of the few places I tried in Greektown, looking to try whole buncha others but will definitely be coming back here regardless. I would agree with calling it the best lambchop I had by far, but again, so many other places I haven't been yet. We shall see."}
{"text":"One of my happy places cause they accommodate my food allergies and cook with pure olive oil and free-range meat. I have visited this place at least 50 times over the years. The stuffed eggplant is divine and I love the simple Horta Vrasta. Another family favourite is the lamb shank in tomato sauce. We ask for the orzo replaced by okra to make it gluten-free. The chicken livers are the best I have ever tasted with lots of onion and mustard seed. They have a great dip platters. You can choice from a variety of traditional Greek dips. My favourite combo is skordalia, melitzanosalata and black olive tapenade. They always bring us lots sliced cucumber to replace the pita as they know we don't eat bread.

The service is always warm, friendly and accommodating. They consider their repeat costumers apart of their extended family and are often seen giving out big hugs and thanks when people coming in for a visit."}
{"text":"So I went here with my dad because astorias line was too long. Service was good and food came out pretty fast- except my dish was horrible. I got some Feta and lamb pie thing. The crust was thin and dry and all I tasted was salt from the feta. Literally a salt lick. I would have sent it back but he already had gotten his fish (which actually looked pretty stellar, and what I maybe should have ordered). When she asked me how it was I told her right out that it was too salty, but they didn't do anything to correct."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!

A Greek colleague of mine suggested to try Avli and I've been there today. I had a very delicious appetizer and mousaka. The best mousaka I had in Toronto I can say! The server recommended us a Greek wine for this food to have a complete experience.  It was great! I'll make Avli one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto"}
{"text":"I grew up near Greektown and I've tried almost every greek restaurant on the Danforth. Although I enjoy many of them, Avli is definitely one of my favourites. The owner is often there, and he takes pride in presenting very delicious food from his country. 

I've sat on the patio and inside, and both times got prompt service. They have some affordable wine too, which is nice. 

My favourite dishes I've had are: 

1. The home made Bougatsa (greek custard dessert) is out of this world!!! 
2. Spanakopita - I really like it here - it's home made and not too sweet. Some people might not like how much dill is in it, but I quite enjoyed it.
3. Dips! They have all sorts of dips. The olive tapenade is my favourite thing to start with. 
4. The CALAMARI!!! It isn't deep fried, and it's stuffed with tomatoes and garlic. SO. Good."}
{"text":"There were 3 of us, we went into Avli last night for dinner, all was tense. Just kidding. The place was slow so we had great service and the food was a little different and unique. Both my friends had the Lamb Fricase which was in a light creamy sauce served with artichokes. They both loved the lamb. 

I went with the traditional Chicken kabob with potatoes and rice. Starting with a Greek salad. My friend had a broiled octopus which he squeezed lemon on and shared with us all. I have never enjoyed octopus like this, its usually rubbery and un digestible however this app was not, it was tasty and edible. Kinda looked like chicken.

Anyways the food was great, we took pictures and put them onto FB and tweeted for all to see."}
{"text":"Visit here often with family. Most of the food here is great with authentic flavours. I have had the meat platter, seafood platter, lamb shank, rabbit pie, pasta which were terriific. I would highly recommend the garlic shrimp which is delicious. Their bread/flatbread is also very good along with the house made dips. The decor is very soothing and inviting, once they had a live band playing. The service is also very good, it is pretty expensive but so are all the restaurants in this area."}
{"text":"The food is authentic and delicious (we had vegetarian moussaka, eggplant, beans, etc.), but somewhat overpriced.  Dining experience was okay.   

Reason for two stars was that the server gave my veg girlfriend a non-veg moussaka, and did not handle the situation well, at all.  Unfortunately, moussaka (quiche-like) is one of those dishes where the first time you realize there is meat in it, is after it is in your mouth."}
{"text":"Avli Restaurant is still among the best on the Danforth and was one of Eddies and my favorite places but it has seen better days. My friend Chris use to work here and that's what brought me here in the first place.  When they get the food right, it is so good but it isn't consistent.  That being said, on a bad day it is still better than most on the Danforth and that's why the 4 stars. I usually order the lamb shank served on a bed of orzo with sun-dried tomatoes in red  sauce. This can be mouth watering on a good day."}
{"text":"I've been going to Avli for years and am convinced it is the best Greek restaurant on the Danforth.  The food is uniformly terrific and Lambros, the chef/owner, is a kind and generous host who welcomes his guests like family.

There are lots of highlights, but here are just a few:

1. The Dips.  It's worth making a trip to Avli just for the dips.  Their taramasalata (a common greek dip made from fish roe) is light and creamy and by far the best I've ever tasted.  Melisanosalata (eggplant, onion, mint, olive oil) is delicious and refreshing.  Kopanisti is a fantastic dip made from feta cheese, chilis, and roasted pepper.  Skordalia is a rich, creamy dip made from roast garlic and potato.  Even their tapenade (served complimentary with bread when you order)  is unusually good - not too salty and infused with orange zest.  

2. The mezes.  You can go to many places on the Danforth and get stingy portions of uninteresting mezes (\"little plates\") but at Avli they are generous and perfectly cooked.  Calamari (fried or, better yet, grilled and stuffed) are tender and never overcooked.  Chicken livers, sausages, dolmates (vegetarian vine leaves), tomatoey mussels in white wine, octopus, spinach pie...they will all make you smile.

3. The vegetarian options.  This is something that also separates Avli from the pack.  You can be a vegetarian here and get food beyond \"vegetarian skewer\" or spinach pie (although the spinach pie is terrific - made with house-made flaky pie crust, rather than the standard filo dough, and packed full of spinach and feta cheese).  Their vegetarian moussaka is rich and filling.  Their baked lima beans are surprisingly delicious and the baked eggplant with pine nuts is sweet and unusual.

4. The pies.  You won't find these in many places on the Danforth.  All the pies at Avli are topped with a house-made pie crust and loaded with savoury fillings in the clay dish underneath.  Best?  The rabbit (I don't eat rabbit, but I've guiltily tasted the sauce.  Wow, it was good.)  The chicken, mushroom, and rosemary pie. 

5. The lamb shank.  Served on a bed of orzo and rich with sauce, this lamb shank is so tender, you will eat more of the big portion than you intended.  

Most of all, the kitchen staff just care about the food.  Some of the bigger restos on the Danforth churn out their food like assembly lines.  At Avli, because the owner is also the chef, you get food made with love.  And it shows.

Avli is not a place to go if you want souvlaki.  While they serve it, you could probably get it cheaper elsewhere.  But if you want authentic Greek food, come to Avli.

Vegetarian score: 7/10.  Good, solid choices for vegetarians, but it is, after all, still a Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"I am nearly ashamed to admit this: 
I had never tried a restaurant on the Danforth until this month! 
Thanks to a TeamBuy deal, it finally happened though and we went to Avli for dinner.

Let me start this with mentioning that I give them 3.5 stars.

Avli is a smaller restaurant with a rustic touch that makes it quite cozy. 
Our dinner party consisted of 4 adults and a toddler, so we were fine. But I think space could be an issue for larger dinner parties.

The service was friendly, however slow.
Upon arrival we were greeted friendly by an older guy who I think was the owner, then a waiter took over and we were seated immediately. 
After that he could have been more attentive though.
Especially at the end. 
I was waiting quite a bit for the chance to notify someone that I'd like the bill. Our waiter was in the back chatting with 2 other staff members, while the \"owner\" (?) had disappeared. (When we left, I noticed that he had sat down at an outside table to watch the people on the street... Uhm, ok....)

Now to the more positive: The food was good.

They brought us free bread that came with some kind of spinach dip as a starter.
One of the waiters walked around holding a tray with different appetizers ($3 a plate) and we decided on one that appeared to be baked olives served with garlic mousse.
(On that note I have to give up Avli thumbs up for this idea. 
I know, normally I would have never ordered any of the appetizers, but seeing them first made the difference.)
Now for the main courses we ordered the Salmon, the Stuffed Chicken Breast, the large Chicken Skewers, the Chicken Skewer on a Pita and a side order of fries.

The salmon was cooked with caper berry and in lemon sauce and came with sautéed arugula.
The fish was amazing! It  was melting in your mouth.
The stuffed chicken breast was made with rice, dates, cashews, raisins and fresh apples, then topped with saffron cream and it also came with came with rice pilaf.
The chicken was very good. Moist and tender, the way you would expect a good chicken breast. Personally, I did not like the saffron taste, but my husband didn't seem to mind.
The large chicken skewers were served with baby new potatoes and rice pilaf. 
I didn't get to try this dish. But my father-in-law loved it so I am sure they did a good job.
I had the chicken skewer on pita and it came with with fries.
It's kind of a simple dish, but I really enjoyed it.
The fries were great. Crispy and golden, just the way I like it. 
We ordered some extra tzatziki on the side and that went very well with the meat and the pita.

All in all, the food was really nice and I have no complaints here.
We all left pretty stuffed and had no room for dessert. ;)

For me, Avli doesn't make it to 4 stars only because of the issue with the service. But nonetheless, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that the reviews below are of the same restaurant I came to love over the years visiting Toronto.  Granted that I have not been to Avli since 2005 (personal circumstances have prevented me from coming to TO since then).  However, it was wonderful then.  

I particularly recommend the mezza (small plates of appetizers).  The taste of everything I have ever tried there is heavenly, putting our Greektown in Detroit to shame.

As a vegetarian, I am very sensitive to being brought the wrong food.  I never had this happen in my 5 or 6 visits to Avli.

I highly recommend that you try Avli and make up your own mind.  Then, Yelp about it to let us all know the score."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a deal, so when I saw that Avli offered a $25 three course dinner, I invited a friend to check it out with me.  Leaving the Chester station, you pretty much can't miss it, which is very convenient when you're directionally-challenged like me.  Walking in, it was nicely decorated and I saw my friend waiting at a table for me.

Our very sweet waiter brought us lots of delicious bread to nibble on while we waited for our orders.  I had the sausage appetizer, which had more tomato sauce than I was expecting, but was delicious.  I really enjoyed it.  The lamb shank for my entrée was also well seasoned, and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender.  I didn't even need my knife!  I couldn't finish it all, and was unfortunately a little put off the next day when I saw how much oil had accumulated at the bottom of my take away box.  The dessert I chose was ice cream with sour cherries, but I wasn't impressed with the cherry sauce.  

The server was a very sweet older Greek man, who felt the need to explain how we use the debit/credit machine, which was amusing for us.  

All in all, a pretty good meal at a good price, but the regular menu's pricing is shocking.  I would never pay the a la carte prices for what you get here.  It's good, but it's not THAT good.  I'd probably return for their lunch prix fixe, since I'll live in the neighbourhood soon."}
{"text":"As good as Greek food gets in Canada :)

With my return from Greece last month, I was hankering for some delicious Greek grub.  I had an amazing dining experience in Crete called Avli and so after reading the reviews on Yelp, my choice was clear.

We feasted like ROYALTY here at Avli, enough to put us into a coma for 13 hours!!  For starters, we had the DOLMADES (my fav from, Greece) - which was one of the best DOLMADES I've ever had.  We had this eggplant appetizer that wasn't on the menu but they walked around with specials for $3 a plate and we grabbed one.  We also had the traditional Greek Salad called the Village salad and it was fresh, was not highlight, but good still.

For mains, we had the MEAT MOUSSAKA and the GRILLED LAMB.  It was sooooo delicious.  Their Moussaka was sweet and had fresh big chunks of potato and bechemal in it, it was very traditional, just like in Greece.  The lamb was very tender and done medium rare, just like I had asked for - it was delicious.  The potatoes it was served with was divine.  I ate sooo much, I was ready for a nap right after!

The whole meal was great, the service was awesome - fast and super friendly.  very attentive and catered to exactly what our needs were.  I would come back again in a heartbeat.  They really captured the Greek-feel homemade dining experience in the heart of the Danforth.  I would go and try everything on the menu!  A bit pricier, but worth the money for the quality of food!"}
{"text":"This gets a review based on the food provided at the Taste of Danforth. I took off 1 star bc I know it doesn't reflect the tru experience  at the restaurant. 

Although the line up was long for $5 each spare ribs, lamb, and grilled calamari, it was definately worth the wait.   Not only was the piece, and tasty, he's the type of guy to give you an extra if he he feels the one you got was small. 

It was finger licking good. Come have a try!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the friendliest staff on the Danforth. The only problem is the food really wasn't good. Dips and apps were weak and the seafood platter for two was large but mainly covered in butter (after I asked for no cheese on my Greek salad as I don't eat dairy) and rather over cooked. They also stuffed the calamari with chopped onions and tomatoes. Not good! I won't go back anytime soon. I only gave it a shot because my wife bought a Deal Find deal and we live within walking distance. I don't like to be slanderous so I'm hoping this criticism will help them improve because poor Greek food on the Danforth is a recipe for disaster."}
{"text":"I'm so sad to hear they are closing because of the owner's health after a serious car accident. Such lovely food and great service. The Danforth will not be the same."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best Greek options on the Danforth. All of the places that we used to go have gone down hill. We like the menu; lots of vegetarian and seafood options. They took good care of us, we were pleased."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review specifically in praise of the seafood pie. The name does not do it justice. Huge and filling, salmon, shrimps, scallops, mussels, mushrooms, in a tomatoey spicy liquidy sauce it's a classic Greek take on a bouillabaisse, but uniquely Greek, I'm pretty sure they make it fresh, wow, $19 and worth every cent.

The Greek village salad we had with it was fine, nothing special, but WOW, that seafood pie! We'll be back."}
{"text":"We Went there on Saturday for lunch , we where the only one in the restaurant , at first we thought that its not a good sign , but after we ordered and had our lunch , I must say that it was great , the food was very good ! We had the fixed lunch menu for 15$ ... 3 course meal"}
{"text":"The food was mediocore and the service was slow. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My review is based on their food and delivery service. 

1) Delivery was 20mins late - I understand things happen, but it would have been nice to get a call letting me know it wouldn't be on time. 

2) The side salad I ordered came without any dressing, and consisted of bagged shredded lettuce, one slice of tomato, 1 slice of cucumber, 1 olive, and some feta cheese. I've had better side salads from fast food chain restaurants. 

3) The chicken and mushroom pie was delivered in the tin it was cooked in. The top was burnt, and the over all taste was okay. Not horrible, not amazing, just okay. 

4) The mussels. Yes, we ordered mussels. I was weary at first but I figured why not. They actually were good, better than just okay, but again nothing amazing. 

Overall, I wont be ordering from Avli again."}
{"text":"Originally coming from the Mediterranean, I really like Avli's food! Everything is recommended except the hummus. The lamb shank and rabbit are great dishes!"}
