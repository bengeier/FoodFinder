{"text":"Expensive, cold fries, didn't get gluten free order correct...might as well drive to five guys."}
{"text":"My boyfriend got the Classic burger and my first thought was that it looked even better than it does in the picture on the walls. Cheese was perfectly melty. I tried it and it was delicious. Juicy and the sauce on it was great. Very good burger.

The fries were really good too, but just they're fries so not really much to write home about. I got the chicken tenders because I generally prefer chicken over burgers. The chicken tenders were alright, crispy good batter, not too flavorful but to be fair it isn't their specialty. 

The service is great, and friendly. I took off one star because the dipping sauces for the chicken leave MUCH to be desired. I've tried three now and they're just so plain. Added to chicken that needed more seasoning, that's pretty bad. The honey mustard is watery and bland, and the buffalo is also too watery. They could make that dip more tasty, thick and fun by maybe adding blue cheese or ranch to it."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite place to get a burger, i love the burgers, but i can agree the service can be quite slow when they're clearly not busy. However I went here on a Friday just before 6 and they were closed. everywhere it says its open until 11, so i'm very disappointed they were closed at prime dinner time."}
{"text":"Great burger and shake!  Excellent service, they deliver the food right to your table. Very clean and cool atmosphere. Definitely recommended for a quick dinner or lunch for the family."}
{"text":"There were probably 5 people in the restaurant when we arrived and after we ordered it was well over 30 minutes to get our food and drinks. Then to top it off our fries were barely warm when we got them. I told them and they basically smiled and said nothing. They should have done the right thing and brought us fresh hot ones but ignored it. The burger was OK but just OK. Way overpriced and unbelievably bad service."}
{"text":"Not a bad little burger place, certainly better than the traditional fast food alternatives. Still, the meat is lacking and the ingredients weren't as fresh as they could be. It definitely won't beat out Five Guys or Clive but it's a good option in the area if you need a burger. Despite that, the milkshakes are actually really delicious, possibly being the best I've had in Calgary recently."}
{"text":"I have visited this Boardwalk Fries & Burgers location twice since they opened in the summer 2015. With a lack of other fast casual burger joint in the area, this chain is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood.

Boardwalk can be most easily compared to Smashburger, with a range of set burgers plus the option to customize your own burger. The menu also includes turkey burgers and homemade milkshakes.

While the burgers and fries are very good with no complaints about any aspect of the meal, I don't get the same OMG feeling that I get when eating Five Guys. For that reason, I rank the restaurant 4 stars.

I will add that I haven't had a chance to try the milkshakes, yet, but I look forward to trying the peanut butter shake."}
{"text":"We visited on a quiet Sunday night and both enjoyed our burgers and onion rings. The young man working was pleasant and the food was good. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Who takes 30 mins to make fries? Now I understand some places get rushes but with a construction site of like 60 people and only 30 mins to eat you think they would be a little bit quicker. Won't be back, neither will any of those 60 workers. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"The owners and workers here are amazing. Every single time we've come in they have been so friendly and accommodating. They go above and beyond to ensure quality service. They clean their machines every night and everything is always so clean."}
{"text":"The burgers are ok! Nothing really awesome but not terrible .. The service was ok as well... I like the location.. But definitely this is not my favourite burgers place... I would go back again only if there is no more options available ..."}
{"text":"I have tried this location 3-4 times and it gets slower every time.  The fries get cold and the fellow up front was tasked with both taking orders and making shakes so they weren't done when the food was (even though the food took at least 20 minutes)."}
{"text":"I love their chipotle bacon poutine and banana milkshake. poutines are awesome!!!! If you're looking for a chill placenand some comfort food, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The service was awful I had to wait half an hour for my burger and fries and milkshake, is understand waiting that long if there where 50 other people here, but it was me, my friend, a family of three and another guy. It sucked."}
{"text":"Not a ton of restaurant choices in the West 85th area, but Boardwalk is a very clean restaurant serving up burgers and shakes.   Does it compare to other burger joints in Calgary?  No.  But for convenience and friendly service, it does in a pinch.

I was seriously craving a milkshake, and Boardwalk definitely delivered on that front - their peanut butter milkshake is amazing.    The burgers are just meh - not the freshest toppings, but not horrible either.

As mentioned, the restaurant itself was spotless and clean, and the employees working there were slow but very friendly and polite.   Will definitely go again when I want my burger fix but don't want to drive very far."}
