{"text":"Yes!!! Back for the second time.  This place is fantastic.  Love the ambiance and service is spectacular!  Corn Manti, Kung Pao Cauliflower...delicious!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places for cocktails and weekend dinner. The \"Say no More\" gin cocktail is our favorite cocktail.
The Salumi Board and the Short Rib entree never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Went back for Sunday brunch; this place is very consistent with respect to food, vibe and energetic hostess and wait staff. Had prosciutto eggs Benedict and shared a KILLER order of French toast sticks. Heaven."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Excellent service with 5 star quality food and cocktails. Will make it a point to visit again the next time I'm in PHX. Highly recommend. Hostess asked everyone who entered the door whether they had reservations or not which tells me they probably get pretty busy at times. Would make reservations just in case because if it was crouded on my Wednesday night there, it's probably impossible to get in on the weekend."}
{"text":"Great food and cocktails.  Really unique. And a very nice happy hour.   I really liked the small plates which are half off during happy hour."}
{"text":"We have been back several times since my review below, and have noticed changes they have made. It's been a good improvement and we are cautiously optimistic. I would give it 3 1/2 stars at this point. 

OLD REVIEW:

Our several visits to Stock and Stable gain mixed reviews from us.  We have been there about 10 times. The food has been decent to very good. However, the last three visits have been unsatisfactory, and may be our last ones.  We brought a professional colleague to brunch a few weeks ago. When he placed his order, he asked them to hold the pesto and the cheese.  The server asked him if that was a personal preference or did he have an allergy. This is an inappropriate question when a customer asks for a specific accommodation. He responded that it was an allergy, but we are quite certain he would have preferred a little more privacy about that.

Today, we brought a group of 11 in for brunch and had pre-reserved a table for 13. They were seating us at a tall table, and we interrupted that to tell them that we needed accommodations, because three members of our group could not balance on higher chairs.  Although there were many places they could have seated us at a traditional height table, we had to get into a skirmish with them to accomplish our goal. The hostess remained rather sour toward us during our entire stay.  In these two instances, they definitely have demonstrated that they are not accommodating to people with limitations, which is rude, embarrassing, and I thought illegal. In any case, they had better step up their game. There are very many choices for great dining spots in the area, and they would be wise to remember that."}
{"text":"Overpriced... ALL of our food was under seasoned. NY steak had no salt/pepper or seasoning and was over cooked.  The \"shrimp cocktail\" has no cocktail sauce, which was more of a seafood salad... Which was also lacking seasoning.  Definitely not worth it if you're coming here for the food"}
{"text":"What can I say, the reviews are pretty close, we had the Cuban sandwich and the bread used was a complete miss, wrong change it, crazy thick cut multi grain on a Cuban is wrong!  The Bloody Mary mix was good but the house Vodka is the bottom of the list. Service, was fair the touches to the table far to infrequent, too bad because the food was \"good\". Nice vibe and the location around the place is getting better everyday.  We might be back but it's not calling to me."}
{"text":"Really really unimpressed. Small over priced drinks. Salmon was over done and dry, sent back  and was still  dry second time around, I think it was frozen, not fresh. Never refilled my water, $13 for brussel sprouts.
I'd skip this one, lots of better choices."}
{"text":"It was ok definitely not a place I would ever go out of my to come back to. I ordered beet started which was good and kale side. Had to send back kale because it was way salty and my husbands felt his chicken was salty too. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Brandon our bartender recommended great drinks and food! I can't wait to come back and try more. Get the Salumi board and Cubano sandwich. Excellent service and all!"}
{"text":"Great Friday Night spot for the Fried Chicken !  Awesome served up on a Board with BIG biscuits - Salad and special Honey Butter ... A fave of mine and GREAT wine selection

the Roasted Brussels Sprouts and Philly Cheesesteak Rolls are the BEST"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday and the staff was very friendly. The food was excellent, we had the Chicken and Mint Salad and the Grilled Cheeseburger.The fries were delicious. They have a second bar upstairs that is opened at night that we got to see. I have not seen anything like it in Phoenix. We will definitely be back for a drink and dinner"}
{"text":"I started out wanting to like it. Too many things changed my mind. The waiter altough very nice  took a while to get drinks.  I did enjoy the small plates. My husband and I decided to share an entree which there were two maybe. We got the chix and so dissappointed when it came a quarter of a chix looked like it was plopped on a plate. No presentation what so ever. I think for the cost you could have had a vegetable and a grain and still made money.  The noise level as the night went on got really loud."}
{"text":"We were a party of five on Easter night when there were only four tables seated all in the outside area.  One of the tables had a toddler who was loud, misbehaving and whose parents were encouraging his acting up.  When we asked one of the employees to please deal with the situation they rudely refused stating that it was \"a family friendly restaurant\".  When we tried to get some satisfaction from the pumped up and ridiculously rude assistant manager - explaining that three of use were former servers and restaurant managers and knew exactly what should be done - he paraded out to our table in a huff and asked us to leave and never come back.  To say it was outrageous would be a compliment.  PS - the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Went here for a date night. Try the Busty Lou cocktail and Philly Cheese Steak Egg Rolls. Yum!  The night we went there was one bartender, so the drinks were slow. The A/C was freezing!  The Beer Butt Chicken and Cream of Spinach are to die for. Skip the Cubano sandwich.  The patio is very nice. Reservations don't mean anything, we were sat by the servers station."}
{"text":"We love it when we're \"mooved\" by a new restaurant with a great menu and has something to offer. You know we wouldn't want to \"steer\" you wrong. We expected the newly opened Stock & Stable in the hip, happening compound called The Colony on 7th Street to be serving up plenty of old fashioned meat 'n' potatoes kind of grub. It ain't necessarily so, pardner. There's more than meets the eye. And mouth.

Stock & Stable isn't the cow palace kind of steakhouse we were expecting despite the moniker, the bovine portraits adorning the wooden walls and the chic, modern, copper-ceiling tiled \"saloon\" feel it has. The name is a nod to the venerable, nearby Murphy Bridle path through the North Central Corridor. The smart, classy \"gastropub\" (a name that's bandied around way too much these days, much like the \"restobar\" of the early 2000's) is the incarnation of Chef Joe Absolor, formerly of The Clever Koi, Parlor and R&R. 

We were pleasantly surprised at the variety of fine comestibles available. Stock & Stable goes beyond the \"chuckwagon\" fare you might be expecting with a name like that. 

Consider starting with something from the \"Shared Plates\" offering. (You might not even want to share.) We tucked into the almost misleadingly labeled Pork n' Beans. There's no barbeque and it's nothing like the Van de Camp's you might be imagining. Served chilled, you get a generous plate of green beans, smoked onion cannellini bean pur√©e, heirloom tomatos and guanciale--a slightly bacon-like cured pork jowl (of which we wish there were more.) A hint of mint in the dressing brings out a burst of summer flavor. $12

More light and fresh shareables like Fruit Cocktail, Frutti di Mare, Roasted Cauliflower and more tempt you to return.

The Baby Gem Salad is a miniature reimagining of the classic Wedge Salad with five fist-sized halves of sweet lettuce with a tomato confit, shoepeg corn, almonds, a cheddar-y shopshire blue cheese with buttermilk vinaigrette. A scattering of succulent pickled grapes will have you begging for more. $10. 

There's more than \"meats\" the eye at Stock & Stable. Pasta! We opted for the housemade Farfalle with Schreiner's sausage, clams, shrimp, heirloom tomatoes and crispy artichoke. We loved it, but they skimped on the actual pasta. Crostini provided gives you a chance to sop up the tasty broth. $14

Five sandwiches make it hard to choose, but you can't go wrong with the Cubano. Two slices of country bread are stuffed with a mouth-watering, tender pork shoulder smoked on the premises. Pad it with mortadella, provolone cheese, Tony Packo's sweet-hot pickles (a to-die-for Ohio specialty that packs a punch. Get some at AJ's) and dressed with yellow mustard. The succulent pork is $14. 

More sandwiches like the Turkey Bacon BLT, Grilled Cheesburger, Crispy Chicken and Tuna are also up for grabs. Each come with your choice of frites or side salad.

Big appetites will love the Double-Cut Pork Chop topped with a warm compote of roasted peaches for $19. The sweet and tender chops satisfied, but could've been a tad bigger. You can also Beer Butt Chicken, New York Steak, Swordfish or Trout. 

The menu changes here and there according to seasonal bounty, so you'll want to check in from time to time. Our summer dessert pick was a tasty, housemade Peach Shortbread with Whipped Cream. 

The \"fire water\" cocktails on the menu won't disappoint, but don't miss out on the \"secret\" Honor Amongst Thieves speakeasy upstairs after 6 p.m. for some boozy fun. 

Stock & Stable offers late night options for night owls and weekend brunch. Feed 'n' supplies are locally sourced whenever possible from places like Noble Bread and Lux Central for pastries. Don't miss their Social Hour with treats like Chili Cheese Curds, Deviled Egg Dip, and Philly Grilled Cheese. 

All in all, it's a right fine round-up at Stock & Stable."}
{"text":"This is my second time to eat here since it opened and my second review.  I enjoyed my dinner and cocktail this time just as much as I did last time but its still way too loud.  Last time they were out of desserts but this time they had them all so we got a the Key Lime tart and shared it.  Yummy!  My dinner date and I decided to walk upstairs and check out the bar after dinner and we were both very impressed with the space.  Will have to go check it out soon.  Keep up the good work but can you do something about the noise level?  LOL"}
{"text":"I'm giving them 2 stars because our server was a very nice young man and tried his best to please. Also, the ambiance of the place is quite nice with little touches like a leather covered cocktail menu that play into the name which is cool. 

However, we were disappointed with the food. I ordered the steak and eggs which was supposed to be a  5 oz NY strip but I'm not sure that was the actual cut of meat. I asked for the temperature of medium and got a well done piece. A sin against beef. Also at the table was pancakes. Although the portion size was enough for 3, the cakes were heavy, cold, flavorless and without the honey the menu claimed they had. The cakes did not come with sides. The preference would be a smaller portion of cakes served with at least one side. The maple syrup was cold. We asked to have it heated but their heating lamp must not be functioning properly because after 2 attempts the syrup was still very cold. 

Last, the online menu is not aligned with the actual menu. We came for the Belgian waffle as seen online, but found they were not on the menu upon arrival. 

Overall, a disappointing experience but the place has potential. They've got work to do."}
{"text":"Lamb pasta was ok. My husband got the Cubano sandwich, which was awesome! Definitely would recommend that dish, plus the vibe was awesome. 

Overall, would recommend and will be back soon to try new dishes. Happy hour wines were also a plus."}
{"text":"I really liked this place and the people there are really friendly.  I'm even more impressed, however, with the speakeasy upstairs and in the back -- Honor Amongst Thieves, which appears to be part of the same company.  That place is AMAZING in every way."}
{"text":"I live up the road. Decided to come here today by myself. Food is delicious. I'm a vegetarian, so some plates available - but that is what you get at a place named Stock & Stable. Meat lovers will really enjoy this place. The staff are super friendly. Really good for a place that just opened."}
{"text":"Damn near disgusting! I got the pancakes and they had almost no flavor what so ever. Completely void of taste. The lemonade was not to my liking. I will say, the server was very polite and respectful. On the other hand, I did ask him to warm up my syrup which he could not do. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Special was sold out at 7:30. Service was mediocre at best. If they improve the service they could get another star."}
{"text":"New in our hood  and will not be back.  Low end furnishings and mediocre bar service was not what we expected. This is the problem now living in central Phoenix with everything going in quick hastily setting up shop with not feeling of roots what makes this area unique. Another overpriced culinarily disaster. Door really wanted to enjoy but just more of the same."}
{"text":"We had never been before, so a friend and I had to \"check it out.\" We dropped in for a glass of wine. It was a Monday after work, so not out of control busy, but not completely dead either. Our server was very friendly and attentive. I didn't pay, so not sure about price. I'll check when I actually have to pay. There is seating at the bar. I would definitely try again."}
{"text":"This restaurant opened recently, and seemed like they were working out the wrinkles service wise. It was very good. Our waitress was friendly, helpful and attentive. The burger I ordered was expensive, but huge and delicious. I don't know where they get their pickles, but they really added to the great taste. Initially I was disappointed with the quantity of fries, but as it turned out it was just right, and also tasted great. I was driving so didn't enjoy any cocktails, but my friends were very happy with theirs. All in all, a really nice place I recommend you try."}
{"text":"Very poor service and food.  The chicken was burnt and dry; I would not recommend it. The waitress, unbeknownst to us and without request, apparently decided to add premier liquors to the couple beverages that we ordered, because our bill reflected upsells.  This place refuses to split bills for larger parties, or at least it did for us, and our waitress was rude.  When a manager was requested at a subsequent time, the staff member refused to get one.  A manager later called and was rude and disinterested herself.  If I were the employer, I would be very disappointed.  As a customer, I am disappointed."}
{"text":"No just no. We were way too polite to admit that a Denny's steak tasted better than the two we ordered last night. Over cooked, bland and greasy as bacon. The mashed potatoes are bomb and the drinks but man i'm glad it wasn't a first date..."}
{"text":"Was not impressed that the chef (owner) will not substitute cheddar cheese for American.  NO SUBSTITIONS!   Come on chef, no cheese for me?"}
{"text":"Very good steak and service. We originally sat outside and had to move inside due to the wind. They were kind enough to accommodate us. The waiter inside was very funny and we enjoyed the service. I imagine that on a nice day it would be great to be outside. I'll definitely be back!  Good for a casual date night."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Stock & Stable, however I wound up leaving disappointed. 

I ordered a rib-eye and a Caesar salad, over all the food was very bland and to me not worth the money. However, the drinks were delicious.
 
The service was good despite having waiting 15 minutes to get our drink orders taken. Which was made up for when he asked if we had been upstairs to Honor Amongst Thieves, which was our next stop. He took us up there personally."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday and heard great things about it. Ambiance and decor was awesome. My drink, the old Cuban, was delicious. Everyone in my party said they loved their choices for drinks as well. Now comes dinner. I ordered the ribeye and it came out timely with a decent portion size. I ordered it medium rare and it came out well done, like really well done. The knife that I was given barely helped cut it. My friend got the blackened salmon and it also came out over done. It's a shame, the seasoning on the protein was on point but the execution, not so much. Might head back for the drinks, not so much for the food."}
{"text":"Where to begin?  Very noisy, nice decor, but hard to enjoy yourself when you can't hear the other members in your party.  We ordered the salami board.  It was a good amount and perfect for sharing.  It was the cocktail menu that really turned us off.  None of us were familiar with the ingredients.  It's kind of intimidating and not cool when you have to google what each ingredient is. I understand trying to be unique, but there are limits!  I ordered the Green Acres...what a bizarre drink.  Maybe I don't have the right palate for this restaurant, but I did not like it at all.  Also, our group sat at the bar.  The service was less than impressive.  I felt like the bartender was just put out trying to deal with us.  She seemed annoyed, and barely checked up.  I may or may not give this spot another chance.  They have a great concept but a lot to work on."}
{"text":"Unfortunately consistency is not a strong point of theirs .. I've dinned in and had the Kung po cauliflower and it was super tasty, the asparagus, service and yummy drink was up to par. But fast forward to today when I'm feeling under the weather but despite that I work my way up to call in an order and drive to pick it up. 

On my pick up order I went with the Kung po cauliflower minus carrots and wanted to try something new so I went with the crab Mac n cheese. Once I arrived home I was greatly disappointed when I got my food out and seen my Kung po had very Lil veggies and no cashews wtf ummmm nothing like what I had when I dinned in. Crab Mac was as seen online and tasty but if you dine in or pick I expect the food to be the same. 

When I called to let them know I was told oh would you like to come back we can fix it. Um no like I told her over the phone the whole reason I ordered takeout was because I was feeling under the weather. Not sure I'd return to dine in but I do know for a fact I'll never order to-go from here and to think I actually left a tip when I paid uggh 

Get it together Stocks & Stable"}
{"text":"We were able to visit Stock & Stable for brunch while on vacation. The service was friendly and prompt. The menu was unique and very tasty!"}
{"text":"To the chefs and bartenders you would have gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for the waitress (I wish we could remember her name). Food and drinks were amazing.  Service was actually good; until we got our check.

We were there during happy hour (which waitress did point out to us about three times).  2 of us in party  of 4 decided; let's get cheese burger that is on happy hour menu because hey it's only $6 and includes fries.  When we order waitress asked if we would like salad instead of fries....well sure we thought (even if uncharge would still be worth it).

Our party wasn't being cheap; about 6 drinks; sausage plate AND 4 entrees. So when we got check:  we were charged for $15 burger.  When we ask waitress her exact response was \"ohh; that is a smaller burger and i didn't know that is what you wanted\"

NO offer to make it right or even meet in the middle.  She just kept saying how right she was.

So IF you want to order off happy hour menu be EXTREMELY clear with wait staff because they WILL NOT make it right and I will not be back because of the poor service."}
{"text":"First of all, I'll be clear - I'm not in to writing reviews everywhere I go... it's usually done if it's really good or really bad - or more importantly - 'memorable' in some way...

So Traci and I (who eat in the nearby Arcadia area 4-5 nights a week) decide to try a place that has clearly been on our radar, has the buzz and been open a while.  It's hopefully found it's mojo, and should be 'singing' by now - as they opened in (approx) October of 2016.  Today is March of 2017 and it's a Thursday.  So how do they do?  Traci and I sit at the bar for dinner and here we go...

We're greeted by Jackie and the entire bartend staff (who clearly share the guests for quick and prompt service) and has immediately made an impression:   knowledgeable, warm and comforting with a clear awareness of everything on the drink and food menu....  Already off to a good start...

We get a couple cocktails as we watch them being made - clearly hand-crafted with a little extra effort... love it... already impressed.  Traci had the Stock and Stable Whiskey Sour and I had the 'Remember the Maine' (unbelievable, look on the menu for ingredients).  Life is good...

On to dinner... we start with the brussel sprouts (honey butter, pickled crasins, breadcrumbs with a drizzle of balsamic) - and as you all know - they can be 'great', 'good' or 'no thank-you' - depending on how they're prepared.   These were charred to perfection and amazing.  Well done!  Traci got the braised short rib for dinner and I got the beer butt chicken.  Both were fabulous - nicely prepared and 'fresh'.  Not warmed from the day before.  They truly had a 'prepared for you' TODAY feeling.  Continuing the good experience....

We passed on desert.  But Jackie made us aware of the SpeakEasy upstairs and after settling up with our tab, she personally assisted us to the the very cool upstairs bar for a nightcap.  Walked up the stairs, found a place at the bar and Ryan greeted us with thanks, appreciation and a genuine appreciation for our business.   I asked him for his recommendation for a good 'brown liquor' night-cap drink and without flinching - made us a couple unbelievable Manhattan-style drinks.  Sometimes you just have to trust the good time you're having and have the wait-staff use their experience to impress, comfort and make you happy.   These guys delivered.  Unbelievable evening!  Would not have changed a thing!

Although the amazing 7th Street restaurant corridor is loaded with great options - you owe it to yourself to give this place a try and follow our lead.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!  It is truly a 5 star experience!

Have a good time and CHEERS!

{"text":"I generally only post when I'm annoyed but this place is cool the staff are amazing and the food is really original and super tasty . Makes a cranky person happy"}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! Great place to go unwind after a long work week. I felt like I was on vacation. The mirrors utensils I walked in. The live band, our great waitress Julia, great and distinct mimosas, out door patio, and delicious assortment of foods makes this place a must attend again soon. And P.S. you can watch football while you are there."}
{"text":"Total trendy hipster joint with pretty damn good food I had the New York steak they say it was Prime but you probably was I ordered it medium it was more medium well could have been because they cut my steak before I came out and all the juices ran out next time I'll make sure to order it uncut also got the braised beef that was pretty delicious super tender full flavor made them better if they use wine and save B stock to Brazen in but overall very tasty also had the pecan pie and the banana cream pie both were good but the banana was way better now the service was excellent came in on a Friday the hostess told us it was an hour wait we decided to go somewhere else as we are walking to the car the hostess ran out and caught us and said there was a table that just left if we wanted to wait few minutes to have it cleaned then our server explain how all their many worked told us some of the good things and was able to ask any question that we had about the menu these things are hard to find lately but you definitely find it here definitely will be back very soon"}
{"text":"I must say, way beyond my expectations! The facility is great as the music as well. We loved the quieter patio for dinner. My for roses whiskey was served well and the burger is an A. The Cubano sandwich is an A++++ amazing. Try it! 

Our second time here tried the chicken sandwich and it is the best in town!

This place has become one of our favorites! From fantastic creative veggie dishes like beet salad to wings this spot is great. Always a hip happening crowd and good music."}
{"text":"I love trying new restaurants and rarely am I disappointed. This is the first restaurant to disappoint me in a long time. I ordered the rolls as an appetizer and the beer butt chicken as an entree, because it looks good on these Yelp pictures and I love chicken. Everything was overly salty and drenched in butter/oil. I couldn't taste anything but salt. The service was sub-par. Our server really made me feel rushed and they didn't even have a line of people waiting or anything. The only reason I am giving it a 2 star instead of a 1 star is because of the ambiance. It also gave me stomach issues the next day."}
{"text":"Went to Stock & Stable on Saturday night and I'm glad we did! The Double Cut Pork Chop was amazing and I'll definitely be back for that dish again! My wife had the Trout which she thought was fantastic! The sides of Tuscan Kale and Asparagus were good, but it would be great if a side was included with the entry. Enjoyed the vodka cocktail How 'Bout Them Apples so much I had two! Recommend that the restaurant add a few more options for the wine by the glass as options were limited (3 reds to choose from). If you're a gin fan then the Say No More, Mon Amour is recommended as our friend enjoyed two of those!

{"text":"The worst service ever!
Waiters & waitress are lacking basic server skills.  
Management could careless.  
Food does not compare to other 7th St. Restaurants.
Pricing is inflated beyond the norm.
This place will not survive the 7th street competition.
Don't waste your time or money.

{"text":"I had the privilege of being invited to their soft opening, what a great concept. All the food and drinks are made from scratch and everything is made fresh. This place reminds me of restaurants that I've been to in San Fransico and Chicago, the food was fantastic. I had the pork chop which was delicious and I also had part of the New York strip which was also amazing. The ambience is something special, it's elegant but comfortable and so many details went into the interior. They also have a great patio and they have a very chic upstairs lounge. The service was exceptional and the staff was very well-trained on the menu. I expect this to be a big hit once it opens to the public on Friday."}
{"text":"Went today on the brunch recommendation of of a manager at another of our favorite places and it was fantastic! Lyndsie was our server and did a great job of recommendations. Started with the Bloody Mary,  had the Prosciutto  Benedict, The Cubano and the Chicken Fried Croque Madame (big toast, gravy, steak, and egg)....All great. Finished with a cocktail.....The Irish Kick!!! (Irish Whisky, Dewars, lemon juice, lg cubed ice) and my wife, who is not a scotch lover (actually hates it!!!), loved this drink! We came from across town and it did not disappoint!  Great covered outside seating."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good music and our waitress was nice and checked on us frequently. I had the linguine which was way too spicy for me. Had the menu indicated spicy, I wouldn't have order it. My boyfriend enjoyed the chicken and asparagus. Afterwards we enjoyed a couple cocktails upstairs"}
{"text":"I have to give it up to Paul the bartender on this! I came in for dinner after a long day. I was starving and ordered a Ribeye medium rare... the steak came out and I cut into it, guess what? It was closer to medium well! I called the bartender over, not being a jerk and showed him the cut, I said I am starving and I'm not going to send it back. He offered me to have another one made but I was to hungry to wait. When the bill came he didn't charge me for the steak. I wasn't expecting that. I was more suggesting that he let his cook staff know that medium well and medium rare is far apart. We conversed a little and he said to give us another try. The way Paul handled this situation is the reason I will return. Good job Paul!"}
{"text":"Employees are amazing! Jeremy was very helpful with suggestions. + Prompt greeting and service! Love the vibe where everyone seems to be happy to see you and work there. Burger is amazing. I know...who can screw up a burger? Well, S&S knows how to put the right flavors together. Delish. Daughter enjoyed the NY Strip with some tasty side sauces. (They were still happy to bring her ketchup...she's 11...).
Can't go wrong ordering the cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food is great. The fried asparagus is the best on the menu. However, the salmon entree should be skipped... veggies and sauce were great on the dish but the fish itself was dry. The desserts are all wonderful. I took off a star because the last few times I have gone I have had the slowest service. The restaurant is clean and bathrooms are maintained."}
{"text":"What a great little surprise! So much unexpected flavor in every dish. I got the Philly cheesesteak egg rolls with a side of broccoli rabe. Wow. So amazing- I will definitely be going back. The Brussels sprouts are also phenomenal! Prices are beyond reasonable for the size of the dish and the quality and taste of the meal."}
{"text":"I believe since this was my first time and it was brunch I may have had higher expectations then normal. I've driven by to many times to count. The place is nice inside and out, the patio is great during cool weather. The service we received was good, very attentive and friendly. We all ordered something different from a pretty simple menu which can still be challenging. I ordered the biscuits and gravy which had the right amount of salt with biscuits that were fluffy and moist, topped off with a sunny side up egg. Others ordered French toast sticks. I didn't feel compelled to order any cocktails on this particular day but the list looked amazing. So the 1 star missing is for the next visit for cocktails to determine if I can change my score. I recommend going on a Sunday after 1 to enjoy a non crowded meal.  Everyone enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"My wife and i had an excellent meal here last night.  We had mixed reviews from friends but we loved it and will recommend and will be back.  We started with the jallapeno popper which was made with a huge Anaheim pepper with a wonderful flavor.  On our waiters recomendation i had the black cod which also had calamari, clams, and shrimp.  It was a perfect 10 which i cleaned every bit of sauce from the plate.  My wife had the salmon dish which she said was cooked perfectly and paired well with an amazing sauce.  Our waiter Scotty took great care of us and we had a wonderful dining experience.  5 stars."}
{"text":"This review is based on cocktails and decor only. 

Came in for a few drinks on Monday night while we were figuring out dinner plans. Had heard great things that were supposed to come from this new place so we were pretty excited. 

First impressions of the decor was that the place looked amazing. Rich colors, county accents with leather and wrought iron, looked great!

 After staring at the drink menu for a while trying to figure out what in the world all these fancy words meant (thank you Google dictionary) our party of 4 ordered the Green Acres, 2 Solera Gomez's and the bartender's Blue Ribbon drink (rummer time(?)). Our excitement disappeared as soon as we took our first sips. Now I've had some bad drinks, usually it's the bartender pouring too heavy, but these just tasted awful ingredient wise. They didn't blend well at all and just seemed like someone was trying to be too artsy and out there. We all looked at each other, said ok chug em down and let's go somewhere else cause it was obvious we didn't have the palates that this place was concocting for.

Hopefully their cocktails will be switched up regularly to something more edible or we may come back for just wine and to sit on the patio to enjoy some appetizers..or we could just go to Postinos which always impresses."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and were literally the only people in the entire place. The d√©cor and music were modern and appealing. I ordered the Cubano ($14) and the Tuscan Kale ($6). 

The warm kale salad was definitely large enough to share. I liked it but not enough to finish it (even sharing with a friend). I wish there was an option for a simple side salad.

The Cubano was a good size and pretty tasty. The smoked pork shoulder was delicious. The service was good but it was a little pricey for lunch."}
{"text":"Stock & Stable is a great restaurant. The ambiance is casual, but nice. The outdoor seating is wonderful and there is a very large bar inside. 
A waiter suggested the kung pao cauliflower. I was hesitant at first (because I'm not the biggest fan of cauliflower) but it was delicious! I would highly recommend. 
Overall the menu is a little pricey, but worth it. I will be back."}
{"text":"N.Y.  strip steak was 75 % fat!!! My lord...I had to keep spitting out pieces of fat.  36 bucks???? It came out sliced (leaving all the juices behind)...causing the steak to get cold.  You add 2 bucks to an old fashioned because of bitters????  Who adds money for bitters??? An old fashioned is a well drink..yet not considered a well drink on happy hour..so they charge the extra money for bitters.  Never seen anyone do that.  Was our anniversary...and it was a wreck.  Overpriced....had better steak at Applebees.  With the name of stock and stable...steaks should be amazing.  Also for the price of steak..a small amount of potatoes and mushrooms shouldn't cost extra.  Total bill after 4 alcoholic beverages on happy hour..a ribeye...a NY strip..mushrooms..and potatoes was around 130 bucks...way too expensive."}
{"text":"We tried stock & stable last night for our Friday night date night. I am an avid Opentable user and do not like going to a restaurant with out a reservation but when I tried to book a table, it said that they were no times available for the entire night. So I called and the hostess, Alexandria, told me that if we got there right away then we could get a table otherwise they were booked until 8PM. Alas, I went back to Opentable to try and book something for after 8, still no availability. So we immediately ordered an uber and arrived to see that there were 9 (I counted) vacant tables and it was 6:40PM. Alexandria told me that they were all booked for 7:00 resos. We went to the bar and noticed that there was always at least two empty tables for the entire night. Alexandria was not rude or unpleasant, they just don't know how to operate reservations. When I was in college I was the maitre d for four years at a $16 million dollar restaurant (Mastros) so I get frustrated when I see restaurants not efficiently running the dining room. 

More importantly, the food was good. The bartender with purple hair was incredibly nice and had great recommendations of what to order. She told us her name but after a few titos, I could not remember. We enjoyed the food, atmosphere and sitting at the bar. Just spend a little time teaching the hostesses how to use Opentable and maximize capacity!"}
{"text":"Had the brunch here this morning. Everything was perfectly cooked and delicious. We had a chicken fried steak sandwich, a Belgian waffle, and a veggie hash. All were fantastic. We will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Had a nice brunch at Stock & Stable. Brunch is pretty lacking in the valley and the choices are limited. I had the Vegetarian Hash & egg and a waffle. Both were very delicious. The wait staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is open and hip. We will definitely be back. I wish all wait staff at restaurants wouldn't serve drinks by holding the rim of the glass. Using the stem or lower part of the glass would be better."}
{"text":"Wow!  From start to finish this was amazing!  Came here with the family, including my 10 year old, to celebrate a graduate school culmination and this place did not disappoint!  From the amazing, unique drinks to the appetizer, steaks, beer butt chicken, fantastic sides and salads, this food was top-notch!  Our server was very attentive and the vibe was laid-back.  We did a lot of searching for a great restaurant and S & S delivered!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  They have modified their menu which makes it 10x better than it was before. Fruit cocktail and Gnudi are by far my favorite appetizers. They added a tuna sandwich to their sandwich selections which is now my favorite sandwich. To their main entrees they added swordfish and trout! Love this place."}
{"text":"Just had the Crispy Chicken Sandwich with fries. Sooo good, the batter was just as described on the menu and the fries were delicious. Waiter was super cool and explained the menu very well.  Multiple waiters and waitresses stopped by just to check in... group effort. Would definitely return.... like tomorrow lol."}
{"text":"I'll probably have to update this review the next time I eat here because I was too busy talking to pay much attention to the finer points of our dinner.  So, take this for what it's worth but I really enjoyed my meal and I will be back.

Went for dinner on a Wednesday night with a cousin from out of state.  Got there at 6:15pm, promptly greeted and seated.  We elected to sit on the patio.  Typical nice October night in Phoenix.

My first impressions, very comfortable, casual restaurant.  Since we were there so early on a week night parking wasn't an issue but I could see it being a little challenging on a busy weekend evening.  It's next block south of Culinary Dropout on 7th Street so if you've been there you know how busy this part of town can get but we didn't have a problem at all getting a space.

We get our table outside, waiter came by to get our drink orders.  Neither of us had alcohol so I didn't even look at the available choices.  I had iced tea which was a little better than normal iced tea.

My cousin ordered the 10 oz New York steak.  It looked perfectly cooked from what I saw.  He wolfed it down pretty quickly so it must have been good.  He ordered a baked potato with bacon and sourcream.  Typical side for a Minnesota guy eating a steak!  That was a sizable potato and it also looked pretty darn tasty.

I ordered the grilled cheeseburger.  It was fantastic.  Perfectly cooked to medium.  The stock and stable sauce was delicious if not a little messy.  I was too busy talking to pay attention to the flavors but it was definitely worth a repeat visit.  It was a messy eating experience but sometimes those are the best.  The fries had a special seasoning of their own which I really enjoyed but again, too busy yapping to pay attention to what it was.  Next time I'll do better.  :)

And there will be a next time.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on Saturday. It wasn't super busy and we got seated right away on the patio. Covered patio which was perfect for a warmer April morning. We got the Stumptown cold brew coffee, prosciutto benedict, and basic breakfast. Great service. Wonderful chill music for a nice relaxing brunch with friends! Definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"This is the worse place I've been. Came here w one friend for happy hr and ordered the chicken and waffles. They fryer were on too hot and it was way too crispy so it would just break off in big pieces. The chicken had a rubber texture and a distinct smell to it. I'm not one to send it back so I just ate the waffle. All this for $14.

Additionally, they service was terrible. He never once check on us. Took forever to get another drink to the point where I had to ask the bus boy to go get the server. The server arrives and takes our order for more drinks. He proceeded to bring the check along w the second round of drinks. We paid that tab and had to start another one dedicated to drinks. Keep in mind it was not busy at all and open tables everywhere. Never will return!"}
{"text":"I must admit I was a little hesitant to try out Stock and Stable at first. I'm not really sure why, I was just nervous that it would be another trendy hipster kind of spot with a great atmosphere but mediocre food. But boy was I proven wrong! My husband went for dinner on a Friday night and everything from the service to the dessert was absolutely lovely.

To start, we got the smoked corn manti - if this would have been a bigger portion, I could have had it for my meal. It was delicious! A little sweet from the corn, and little savory from the cheese, and a perfect way to start off our meal. My husband got the braised short rib for his main and had great things to say about it. The only downfall for him was the mashed potatoes. He said they didn't have much flavor, but the rest of his meal was on point.

I had the crispy chicken sandwich and I have been craving it literally every day since. It was AMAZING! Literally the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. The chicken was perfectly cooked and very crispy on the outside without falling apart, and the slaw on top was seriously to die for. I had zero complaints with my dish.

We ended with their salted caramel cheesecake, which is huge btw, and it was absolutely scrumptious. Here's the only downfalls from our experience with Stock and Stable:

I'm currently pregnant, so I ordered a cocktail off the menu and told our server about my \"condition\" so she made sure it was made with no alcohol. However, when I finished the first and ordered a second, the bartender made it with alcohol... I only found that out after having a drink of it. No bueno. Our server assured us she had told the bartender no alcohol, so who knows where the fault lies, but it's pretty darn important to make sure there's no alcohol in a mocktail for a pregnant woman, so it definitely should not have been overlooked.

The other issue is with the hostesses. I've been to Stock and Stable twice now, and both times the hotesses have barely even acknowledged us when we walk up. They just look at us and wait for us to say hello and how many are in our party. No smiles, no niceties, nothing. It's a pretty downer way to start a restaurant experience, so I highly suggest either training them up on how to greet people or hire new hostesses who know how to smile and act nice. It's a big turn-off."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in the mood for brunch and stumbled upon this spot and were happy we did. The service was good, the atmosphere was great and the food was delicious. We did not have a single complaint. I will definitely be telling my friends about this spot."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and staff. Food is good quality with a nice spin on modern American food. 

Had the Cuban Sandwich (with Tony Pakos Pickles) and it is heavenly. 

Egg salad app is good but nothing too special. Crab app is good."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and everything was great! Food was delicious and outstanding service...our drinks were always filed before they got empty. Shared the beet salad, fritto misto, farfalle pasta, and chicken sandwich. The beet salad is a must!! Great flavors and texture...who would've thought to add almond butter! Fritto misto is served ceviche style and is nice and light. Farfalle pasta is homemade, good flavor, although least favorite of all the things we ordered. The crispy chicken sandwich is really good as well, good breading, not too heavy, and good kick from the hot sauce. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best Pork Chops I've had.  Rivals  5 star steakhouses, at twice the price ( even Perry's in Texas ).   They give you a steak knife, but I cut mine with a fork -   Fantastic seasoning / flavor too !"}
{"text":"This place is no joke. It was absolutely fabulous! We had the salume board, which was the best we've ever had. After that we had the beer chicken, and since my husband eats chicken every dang day, I was blown away by his assessment that it was the best chicken he's ever had. Mac n cheese, awesome, two thumbs up on the asparagus. But the real win was David with the mustache. Dude knows his food, but more so knows incredible customer service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with my son.  We both loved it!  Scott greeted us & politely informed us that they would be opening for lunch at 11 a.m. which was 15 minutes away.  No problem, we sat in the outside patio seating and it gave us time to look over the menu.  Scott brought us ice water and was excellent at describing what was on the menu.  We started with an appetizer that was linguini with seafood, artichoke hearts, tomatoes and sausage.  It was excellent however, a bit spicy for us but delicious nonetheless.  I had the Cubano sandwich which was spot on and I would order it again in a heartbeat.  My son had the Chicken & Mint salad and he loved it, not sure where the mint was, guessing it was in the mix of things but the swoop of creamy cashew butter was great.  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and seemed like a good place to grab a drink. I can't speak for the rest of the menu but the salumi board was not very good and way over priced for what it was. I'm open to giving it a second try but the price of the food seemed quite a stretch for the quality. I guess you're more so paying for the atmosphere?"}
{"text":"Cocktail... ok.  Cauliflower appetizer... amazing.  $28 for a NY Steak... completely mediocre.  It came on a plate with zero sides & for that price should've been good.  It was only ok... was over it after 2 bites.  Great wine selection but limited menu.  I ordered by elimination, meaning I got the only thing that sounded alright & it was just that."}
{"text":"This was my first time and definitely won't be my last. Such an awesome place. The service was great. Our server quickly greeted us with waters and made sure to answer any questions we had. The prices are great! 
Only $5 for morning cocktails. I had the mimosa to start and it was so good. My friend got coffee and they bring you a personal French press which is so great! I love fresh coffee! For breakfast I had the croque madame and wow I'll be getting that again. It was so good and brought back memories from when I lived in France. I can't wait to go back to this place again in the very near future! Next time I'll be back to try out the happy hour!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch--we got there at 10:30 and the place was almost empty--understandable because of being a holiday.  the restaurant is nice looking--I had a typical breakfast and the food was fine--nothing interesting.  There is something off about this place--the service wasn't bad--but it wasn't right--here are things that were strange.  I am a tea drinker--i ordered hot tea and the only tea bag they had was chamomile.  I know how  herbal teas are popular now-- all that they had was chamomile-a very odd choice as it is usually used at night to calm ones' nerves (oh wait--maybe now I understand)--there wasn't a black tea--ie. earl grey, english breakfast or even a lipton tea bag available--so i ended up not having tea this morning  (which does make a girl cranky)--my friend and i ordered a drink--they brought her gruet first and then after several minutes brought my virgin mary--really they couldn't bring the drinks together?  it is not like the place was overwhelmed.  They overcharged my friend for her gruet--only by a $1 but made no effort to resolve it even after my friend brought it to their attention.  As we were leaving--now about 11:30 they posted their $5 specials on mimosas--did our server mention this when my friend ordered the gruet?  Nope.

the menu is trendy--but not particularly interesting--they would have been better off with doing a straight ahead menu and doing it well.  there is something off about this place--maybe because they are still working stuff out-I might go back because friends want to go there--but it would not be a place that will come to mind that I want to return too--"}
{"text":"I've been here on a few different occasions and have never been disappointed. If you're looking for a nice night out, and willing to spend a little more than a casual dinner, this place is great! From the cocktail and wine list to everything on the menu, my friends and I always enjoy every experience."}
{"text":"My tastebuds have been craving Stock & Stable's special Friday offering of Fried Chicken and sensational accouterments. A friend and me were running a bit late for this lunchtime offering, so we called ahead to ensure they hadn't run out, after securing the answer our hungry hearts desired. We ventured into this establishment and ordered our libations and the Fried Chicken specials. Nirvana appeared within 10 minutes, less really, the libations had kicked in. 

We'll definitely return during the typical lunchtime period, with an appetite and lust for more of this delectable, delightful and tantalizing taste bud sensation. Yes, it's that good.

The Bartenders are superb and their service is excellent."}
{"text":"Omg you have to get..... Philly egg rolls, noble rolls, green beans, mushrooms! Damn sooooo good! We also ordered feta & watermelon salad, beer chicken & mash potato. All good but the top 4 were awesome! Service was good also!"}
{"text":"I definitely liked the chic and casual environment and we were seated immediately. The menu itself looked very appetizing. We ordered our drinks of the Coco Verde and Old fashioned and were given waters in their signature cups. The gentleman who was refilling our water cups and our waiter were very polite and generally checked in on us here and there to see if we were enjoying ourselves. We ordered our pork belly buns and they are a high recommendation on the list. We also ordered the bolognese and the beer butt chicken w a side of pesto Mac and cheese. The bolognese pasta was definitely my favorite because of the pasta itself. It was a good texture and perfectly cooked. The beer butt chicken was seasoned well, maybe a tad less salt but that skin was definitely to be desired. The pesto Mac and cheese was a nice addition w the creamy sauce and pesto combination. For dessert we ordered the chocolate brownie which was nicely topped w caramel and ice cream. The one thing I like about this restaurant that out to me was the consistent picture perfect presentation on each dish. As an amateur food photographer that is what made my day as I look back over the pictures. Definitely will return to try more soon"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. My wife and I went with two friends and we very pleased. The food was outstanding as well as the service and atmosphere. I'm surprised at the mixed reviews since our experience was so top notch. Regardless, I would definitely recommend and look forward to a return."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend that you check this place out if you are in the neighborhood.  The food is very good, reasonably priced, and the service was excellent.  The waitor gave us some very good recommendations on what to eat and even included a little backstory on some of the ingredients and where they came from.  My only complaint is the bar upstairs is extremely dark, a little too dark in my opinion, but I suppose that is what they were going for."}
{"text":"Service was immediate and courteous. The Food never disappoints. We always leave here with anticipation of returning. Now to walk upstairs to enter the speakeasy- Honor Amongst Thieves for some Specialty Cocktails"}
{"text":"We've been there a handful of times and just love this place!! The speakeasy upstairs has a great atmosphere and an endless choice of cocktails.  The restaurant downstairs has a creative and diverse menu (last night we tried the philly cheesesteak egg rolls & short ribs for dinner. Both were amazing!)  Our server was wonderful.  Brunch is yummy too.  I'm surprised they don't have 5 stars on Yelp.  Try it!"}
{"text":"So what's with the ampersand trend lately? Seems like all the hoppin' new restaurants are named with two arbitrary nouns and an ampersand thrown in between them. Not saying that I have a problem with it, just an observation. 

Anyways, I met a friend here after work one day, and we decided to kick off our S&S experience by boozin' it up at Honor Amongst Thieves (now THERE is a kickass name), the speakeasy in the back and up the stairs. First thought upon walking in: holy shit is it dark. I know, I know, it's gotta have the whole speakeasy vibe. But they could turn it lights up just a smidge and still maintain that. They did a great job with the environment though, with the plush leather chairs and giant wall of illuminated liquor bottles. The bartender was nice and attentive, and didn't hesitate to answer any questions we had and provide his own recommendations. I ended up going with the Stole Fashioned. It was fine, perfectly acceptable, but not mind-blowing. To be fair, I'm kind of a snob when it comes to old fashioneds. But I likely would not shell out $10 for another. 

We headed down to the restaurant after our drinks, really just looking for some snacks to graze on. It's a pretty open space, not terribly crowded with enough room to easily walk between tables. There weren't too many people there when we arrived, but it was still pretty noisy even though we were seated more towards the back. It took a bit before we were visited by our server, who was nice enough, just not terribly attentive. The service was in general was fine. It seemed to take quite a bit for us to get our food, despite it not being too busy in the restaurant. When it came time to pay, the server returned my friend's check without the card? She asked about it and the server looked momentarily confused before throwing out a vague apology and rushing off--presumably to find it. She returned a few minutes later with \"Oops! It must have flown out on my way back!\" 

I appreciated that their menu was pretty succinct, but still diverse. We decided to go with the squid ink cavatelli and some frites. The cavatelli is life changing. Get it. And don't be freaked out that they look like little worms :) The frites were fine, but nothing to write home about. 

My friend had the Eastern Promises, which I also had a sip of. In theory, this drink should be my Mecca. I love Thai tea and god damn it if I don't worship bourbon like a deity. But it was just... Disappointing. My friend told our server that she wasn't very into it, and she was nice enough to comp it for us on our check. 

Overall, fine experience. Wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I'd come back if someone else suggested it. The cavatelli was for sure their saving grace."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in a long time! Amazing drinks and delicious food with such delicate flavors. You can tell that a lot of time, thought and taste went into creating the menus! We had the beet salad, sloppy Joe tostada, corn pasta, and panzanella salad. Everything was divine :) Our server Erin was awesome and gave us great recommendations, a yummy sample beer, and a tour of the bar upstairs! Can't wait to go back as soon as we're in town!"}
{"text":"Stock and stable is a very nice place for a sit down lunch or for dinner. The scenery is great and goes well with the location. The food was spot on and menu was small and well executed. Will absolutely go back to explore the rest of the menu. I had the pork belly dish was melt in your mouth good"}
{"text":"Jeremy took care of me at the bar. Great service, excellent attention to detail. He highly recommended the beer butt chicken. The way he described it, I simply couldn't say no. And he was 100% right- it's amazing. I had to stop myself from grabbing the plate and licking it (haha, just kidding, but not really). 

All of his drinks were immaculate. So was the pumpkin cheesecake. 

Great service; great food; cool vibe. Thank you"}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch on a weekday and we really enjoyed it. All of us raved about the food. I had the crispy chicken sandwich and it was incredibly good. Husband had the burger and loved it. The decor was really welcoming and the service was great. We will go back! No one was on the patio because it was a little warm out but it looked really nice."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a business dinner with a larger group and found the atmosphere and service great, but the food a little lacking. Hardly any options for someone who doesn't eat cheese or meat. I know that's specific but usually I can find more things. Had the brussel sprouts and they were boring with little flavor for an app. Dinner I had a sea bass special. Fish was cooked well and sauce was good. Best part was the bread that came for dipping. Tried the sticky bun for dessert and it was incredibly disappointing. Dry in the inside and not enough cinnamon with bad icing - who knew icing could be bad? The drinks were good so I'd recommend for a happy hour."}
{"text":"Very noisy.Food was decent.Liked the sharing aspect of the menu. Staff are pretty and pretentious with little serving skills as it appears the rest of 7th street. Maybe a good lunch spot."}
{"text":"Food, drinks and services are great. My favorite restaurant and been there several times. Love their food and atmosphere. Going to have brunch soon."}
{"text":"The food was great, especially the meat and cheese board. The drink menu is top notch. Only complaint is they served my NY Steak all cut up like I'm a child and I'm like 30. This was double confusing since they got the temperature wrong."}
{"text":"5 of us enjoyed a nice evening at Stock and Stable.  Totally fun and energetic vibe.  Nice draft beer selection!  Food was good - ordered 3 appetizers - totally devoured the Sweet & Sour Meatballs and steak egg rolls.  My favorite though the stuffed pepper.  All of us liked our dinners.  The fried chicken was very good and well seasoned.  Only complaint is it was too much food!:-)  Definitely will return, we want to go have fun in the speakeasy!"}
{"text":"A Saturday brunch and we stumbled onto this place. Great food! I highly recommend the Cuban sandwich. And it just happened to be their two-year anniversary and we celebrated with .01 ros√©. Nice! The service was great and everyone so friendly. Happy weekend. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for pre-date drinks! Very quiet. We sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks, and didn't eat. Super cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Killer food. But I was severely disappointed when the bartender didn't offer water when sitting at the bar, and we had to ask after 20 min. One person wasn't drinking and she just sat there. Took forever to get a menu. I don't blame the service entirely, maybe understaffed, but without a doubt he was far nicer to the guests around my girlfriend and I. We did nothing but sit at his bar and it appeared from the first minute he wanted nothing to do with us. I've bartended and served and I hate having to give these reviews. But his service was rough. My girlfriend is much nicer than me so I didn't say anything. Again, great food. But if you're not a regular prepare for rough service."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour had to wait for service only 2 wine for happy hour red that was not on menu and rose then left."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I have had most things on the menu (I am a little sad that they took the \"jalapeno\" popper off) and everything is good.  The cocktails are great - I like the whiskey drinks like \"Church on Time\" and \"Remember the Maine.\"  They also have solid wine and beer lists.  Apps like the kung pao cauliflower and egg rolls are awesome.  The mains are good too but I can't seem to stop ordering the burger and fries or the chicken sandwich. (that sounds lame, but they are really good)"}
{"text":"In the area as we live way over in the Far East Valley and decided to give Stock & Stable a try. I love trying new places, we showed up around 1:30pm on a Saturday, so unfortunately we were stuck with their brunch menu. The picture of their board is what drew me here and it is not on the brunch menu. As we stood at the hostess stand reading both the brunch menu and the regular menu, food was going by us and it looked damn. We could have waited 20 mins but we decided to go ahead and get seated on the patio. First and foremost it was a beautiful day, the patio is in front of the restaurant in a shopping center called The Colony right off 7th street and Missouri. My husband ordered the burger and fries and I ordered the chicken sandwich with a simple salad and the best dang chili vinaigrette. While basic food on a brunch menu my husband ranked it up there in his top best burgers. The fries were hot and tasty with sea salt. My chicken sandwich was deep fried but not greasy and the pickles and bun made this a great sandwich. We will definitely be back and I look forward to trying the board during their everyday happy hour starting at 3pm."}
{"text":"Sat outside on the patio, amazing weather. Started with the salumi board, great selection of meats. Fried chicken special was a great surprise! The rib-eye was cooked to perfection. I can not wait to come back and try another signature cocktail."}
{"text":"Went in cause I'd heard good things. Looked at the menu with my date who had been there before. Nothing looked good to either of us. She said the menu looked different than last month when she was there so we asked the waiter, Trent. He confirmed it was an all new menu. We got up and left without eating or drinking there. Somebody better fix that menu quickly cause you'll be out of business based upon what I saw of food choices."}
{"text":"Stock and Stable has disappointed me yet again. I made a reservation a month ago and had to wait for 45 min due to the incompetent hostess, which sat 4 tops with two people. My reservation was at 8pm and we did not get a table until 9 pm. The hostess made an attempt to make things better by giving us a free appetizer and one drink for a table of four that ordered  appetizers, wine bottles, entrees and dessert.  
I went there with a friend for happy hour and the  waiter was a bit sassy when we asked him to pre order some drinks before happy hour was over. 

Then today was the last straw, a group of us showed up early and some folks decided to join us and the hostess stated they could not accommodate several additions to our party and the restaurant was basically empty. I am not sure who is running things there but customer service is not a main focus.  I called the Herb Box next door they were able to accommodate us and have a great time!!! BTW they have a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"I really love this semi-new spot. Their service and food is excellent and one can usually get a table out or inside. Their speak-easy upstairs bar is amazing and there is plenty of backside parking. We had a lot of veggies, hummus and a wedge salad and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"It's nice to see this part of town become alive, the new plaza called The Colony is a really cool concept for locals to dive into but the real gem is Stock & Stable!  We have eaten her a few times now and to be honest it's been a great improvement.  There is a stuffed lamb pasta that is to die for, the French onion dip made our friends all fight for the last scoop:)  it's delicious.  We tried almost everything on the menu now and nothing disappoints The drinks are Top Notch, I can't tell you the last time I had a cocktail crafted like the ones at Stock&Stable.  It makes me really enjoy the drink and look forward to trying something new.  If you've saved room for desert a must is the Affogatto, some of my friends don't even like coffee but have to get this desert every time!   I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If you grew up in Central Phoenix as I did, then you can empathize with the fact that the 7th Street corridor is becoming more and more unrecognizable from years gone by.  What was once a landscape dotted with small to medium size businesses ranging from craft stores to equipment rental shops is now absolutely jam packed with new restaurants everywhere you look.  So many in fact that I feel like some will inevitably fail.  Its just too saturated for all of these places to survive.  Only those that can carve out the right niche and step up their game to impress the increasingly sophisticated palettes of the CenPho crowd (and deliver value) will last.  Tonight with a free cocktail coupon in hand, I met up with my Dad for dinner at S&S to see if this place has what it takes.

S&S advertises themselves as a gastropub with an emphasis on simplicity.  Where it relates to the decor, they certainly come as advertised.  Simple (but fairly elegant) wooden tables and chairs, soft lighting, and a surprisingly large restaurant (seating for almost 200) that somehow retains a fairly intimate feel.  It can be a bit noisy in here when full, but for the most part I couldn't have been more relaxed just sitting in the dining area.  The staff was super friendly and unassuming all night and served as a great compliment to the meal we had.

I've heard from a few folks who've been here for brunch, but not a soul who's done dinner here.  So I was flying blind on this one for the most part.  The waitress recommended the Sweet and Sour Meatballs as a starter.  Good call.  Admittedly the sour note wasn't very well pronounced, but the sweet part certainly was.  Sweet potato, golden raisins and a little bit of fruit (I think it was persimmon) were in this dish which acted as something of a palette cleanser to the meatballs.  For my main dish, I always have a hard time saying no to short rib and this was no different.  My short rib was also dressed with the same fruit and sweet potato as the meatballs were.  The short rib itself was cooked perfectly.  The meat pulls off easily with a fork, was super moist on the inside, and only had a light amount of seasoning.  The meat juices here are really all the flavoring this one needed.  For dessert, I got the chocolate peanut butter mousse.  Came in what looked like a mini mason jar.  It may have looked small, but wow was it dense.  Think of it as the richest most dense Reese's peanut butter cup you've ever had, and that gives you a pretty good idea.  Both my Dad and I were stuffed to the gills, but super impressed by the creativity and the approachability of the food and the great service we got from our waitress.

Total cost for an appetizer, two dinners, two desserts, three drinks (not including my free cocktail), tax and tip came out to about $80.  So about $40 for each of us.  Admittedly we went pretty nuts tonight getting the most expense entree items on the menu (most of the entree menu costs half of what ours did), but boy was it worth it.  I'll be back to check out the brunch menu at some point, and would certainly come here to try happy hour as it looks like they've got about 10 food options for $6 each during that time.

Stock & Stable has hit on a winning formula which should keep them in business for the long haul here in CenPho.  Creative food, relaxed atmosphere, good value, and unpretentious.  Pretty much everything you want in a neighborhood haunt.  Another 7th Street restaurant down.  A gazillion still to go (assuming I can keep up)."}
{"text":"Really excellent food, service and ambiance. We were with a large party for work. Everyone enjoyed themselves and the food and drink. It was a hopping place, even on a Wed at 5:30 pm. I will return."}
{"text":"Upper level of this place has a speak easy...super cool touch! Downstairs is a casual indoor/outdoor dining setting. Slightly overpriced but the quality and service were great. The menu is pretty eclectic, definitely strays away from the traditional. Overall great experience, look forward to coming up back."}
{"text":"I wanted to love Stock and Stable. It is literally a minute drive from where I live. I love the vibe of this restaurant. However, the food just isn't great. I had one of the crab appetizers (I don't remember what it was called) and it was a disappointment, especially because the bartender had told us that it was one of their more popular appetizers. I had the NY steak which was just okay. The parsley pesto and butter on the side made it good but I like my steak to be good as it is, without the need to put anything on it. Cocktails were pretty good."}
{"text":"I went to stock and stable for my 21st birthday and looooved it. I am vegan and Lyndsie, our server, was amazing!! Anything I ordered, she would double check if it was vegan and gluten free. The drinks were also amazing. She knew so much about the drinks and recommended the best cocktails!!!"}
{"text":"We've already been twice! Granted, we live just op the street. Everything we've tied has been delicious. My husband and I shared the salted cod tots and the crab dip featuring noble bread. Delicious. He had the cubano sandwich and I tried the carpaccio. Both were great. The cocktails are good too. We went just for drinks on Saturday and had a few of the bees knees and their version of a Moscow mule. Very refreshing, and I'm sure we'll be visiting again and again!"}
{"text":"Not that good.  Got the ribeyeand it looked more like a steak for a samdwhich than a dinner steak.  Was overcooked and they tried to tell me that the marinade makes it tricky to cook and it really was medium even though it had no pink.  Tasted like teriyaki beef you can get at any koyoto bowl.  The knife was so dull it would not cut the steak.  Over priced and pretentious."}
{"text":"Overall experience three of five stars.  Food quality was good, service fair, atmosphere not so good.  Appetizer was great , had the meatballs served on sweet potatoes and enjoyed them. The Cubano sandwich was excellent as was their chicken.  Received the wrong salad dressing and waiter unresponsive to the issue.  Waiter gave us the feeling we were a bother to him.  The layout of the restaurant is all wrong.  Tables way to close together and little in the way of any privacy.  We found the noise level inside not ok and recommend going outside if the weather permits.  Did not feel welcome here at all and will not be back."}
{"text":"So...It was a great addition to the area but just wish these new restaurants weren't so trendy and expensive. I went with a group of 7 ladies for a friends birthday, they took our reservation and were even about 15minutes late and nobody said anything; showed us to our table right away. We had great service and our waitress was super friend. I loved the atmosphere with the big patio and plenty of seating inside as well. I would definitely be back to sit at the bar, but not for the food.

We decided to share a few appetizers for the table. We got the Salumi Board...DEFINITELY not worth the $25. Had a few pieces of bread, some thin sliced salami, a couple wedges of cheese, jam, and some mini sausages. I think it should've been half the price; pretty disappointed. We also ordered the Fermented Beets (yummy), Brussel sprouts (tasted like brussel sprouts), and the chili queso dip (small portion). If you're in the area, stop by for a drink and a shared plate, just know you won't get much for the price."}
{"text":"We stopped in last weekend for happy hour after our dinner down the street at Ticoz.  I enjoyed a really nice glass of Sauvignon Blanc for $5 - what a bargain!  Lively atmosphere, nice decor, and friendly bartenders.  We checked out the menu, but nothing is really drawing me back in food-wise.  Who knows...we'll let them get settled and consider a brunch in the future."}
{"text":"This was a great experience! Ambience was fun, outdoor seating was perfect during perfect weather. Waiter was attentive, very helpful in making food decisions to drink suggestions. We had the meat and cheese tray! Delish! Also order Kung Pao Cauliflower a must try!!! It was all around a great night of food and drinks! Upstairs you can join the bar area if you want to but the restaurant was idea for us! Happy Eats!!!"}
{"text":"Bad experience!  Went for happy hour. Ordered 2 drinks on what we thought was happy hour and ordered a shared plate from happy hour menu. All was great!  Then ordered 2 more drinks after HH ended and decided that we would split a entree and salad. First bill had drinks we didn't order. Then real bill came ..... 94.00!!!! Really?
Come find out my husband's drink was not on HH. NIce of them to tell us.  NOT!  Way too expensive for 4 drinks, salad and entree.  Not impressed at all. Second time there and our last. We wanted to give them a second shot."}
{"text":"I had a new work colleague in town and I was driving around trying to find Joyride Tacos without my phone for its GPS. We found Stock and Stable, and on the spur of the moment, we went in and grabbed a couple of beers and some food. I couldn't believe what a knowledgeable waitress we got on the beer department - and she recommended a sour that was just out of this world. Then, I tried a burger and fries and it was the best thing I'd eaten all week. Their fries are fat and full of parmesan, crispy on the outside and soft like mashed potatoes on the inside. Unique! The burger was to die for. My colleague had some kind of salad and she was raving about how good it was. We thought it was a cool vibe and we're so happy to have run into the place. Midway through our meal, the GM brought over the beer and spoke to us -- super nice guy, not the normal \"Everything OK?\" question, but a real conversation. I would say that this place is going to be on our list as a go-to destination from now on!"}
{"text":"Everything was great.... except the brownie to ice cream ratio was off. One more scoop of ice cream is definitely a must."}
{"text":"Food and service spot on. Great cocktails. The brisket  cheeseburger is amazing. The beet salad?  Fantastic!  Only drawback?  Noisy."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I don't live in Phoenix but I've been trying to make my way through the new 7th St restaurants every time I visit. I ended up at Stock & Stable for Easter brunch this time, and it was such a good decision!

The restaurant was pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table. We asked for a table outside and got a seat in the sun, which was okay with us (the hostess asked first). Note to S&S: on hot days, maybe don't put the silverware out until the party is seated, since it heats up and is too hot to use! In retrospect I shouldn't have been too surprised by this, but they had a special Easter brunch menu, instead of their normal brunch, which had looked amazing and that's why we picked to come here in the first place. No matter though, the Easter menu looked delicious and we settled on the salmon and Dungeness crab scramble and the Scotch egg with a side of toast. 

The scrambled eggs were for me and I was so pleased with my dish. The eggs were cooked with the crab, chives, and Mascorpone, there was a sprinkle of arugula, and a good-sized piece of grilled salmon lay on top of it. When I first started eating the eggs, I had my sunglasses on and couldn't see the crab, but I did notice the crab taste. After I took my glasses off though, I realized that the egg to crab ratio was like 50-50. There were also large enough whole chunks of crab that I could pick a couple out for my husband. The eggs were creamy and the crab tasted fresh. I thought the salmon was a little overgrilled, but I like that charred grill taste so I'm not complaining. It was a nice accompaniment to the eggs, which I thought were really the star of the dish. My husband seemed happy with his meal too. The Scotch egg is a 6 minute egg wrapped in sausage, breaded and fried, over an arugula salad with grapefruit. I didn't have any of his food, but he ate the whole thing.

I'm not sure I'll ever be in a position to recommend a brunch place in Phoenix but if I am, I will for sure mention S&S. My sister-in-law says their dinner menu is great too, so hopefully I get to test that out soon!"}
{"text":"Great potential, interesting looking place , very casual, nice bar. Service very friendly.
As far as the food; the shrimp cocktail was more like a flavorless ceviche, the steak in the dry side for a medium rare, flavor average.  The beet salad excellent; but suggest to incorporate more beets.  Good experience overall.  I am looking forward to return and see the improvement."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place. Why not Valentine's Day? Reservation made, great. Get here, one of the hostesses refuses to seat us at a table closer to the heaters because \"they have other parties coming in and it's for a four top\". At the time of this post, which is 2 hours after being sat, no one has been seated at that table. 

I ordered the double cut pork chops. I understand the kitchen may be backed up due to it being Valentine's Day. I ask for the pork chop to be seared with a brown crust. The server, Aaron, hesitated and responds with ok. At that point he should've made it known that the double cut pork chops are broiled and not seared. The pork chops come out and they are not brown at all. They haven't been seared at all. I let the runner know I asked for the pork chop to be seared with a brown crust. He says it's well done. Thanks, but I didn't ask for a well done pork chop. 

They take the pork chop back, sear the already well done pork chop, and bring it back out. I take a couple bites and it was like eating paper. Completely ruined. I called Aaron back over to explain that I still would like the pork chop, but this one wasn't edible. Before I could explain that I just wanted the pork chop broiled less and seared more, Aaron cut me off and said \"the kitchen was already pissed that you wanted it seared so they aren't going to make any substitutions because of how busy we are\". Irrelevant and insensitive. 

I asked for the check and Aaron brings it, along with an apology about the food stating he just knew they weren't going to change anything when he already knew what I was asking. I politely let him know he could have no possible clue what I would like because he cut me off. He takes our card and returns to let us know our meal is on him and that he again apologizes. 

I'm pleased with his final solution, but not pleased with how we got there. I was hopeful about this place. I appreciate his gesture, but I do hope the service improves. The twice baked potatoes and creamed corn are phenomenal, as well as the crab mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed our meal, restaurant has a cool vide, I had the beer butt chicken with kale and my wife had NY strip steak and mashed potatoes. Both meals were delicious and cooked to perfection. 

Honestly, I wasn't going to try the chicken because it just didn't  sound right but I must say it was possibly the best chicken I have ever had.  I'll come back agaib."}
{"text":"Stock and Stable is a fantastic restaurant if you enjoy good food and poor service. Order your drinks before dinner if you expect to drink while you dine. If the frustration hasn't killed you by the time you're done, head upstairs to the speak-easy and wait another 35 minutes to be served  a beer. Ohhhhhhh the frustration. I'm here now and i want to leave but I ordered a drink 30 minutes ago- should be here any minute."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Portions didn't match the prices. Julia our waitress was AWESOME. She knew the menu ( which is small) and was very professional. And very attentive to us.  Maybe next time will stick to the appetizers and happy hour."}
{"text":"dinner, on the patio. service: excellent, food: pretty darned good - covatelli  with seafood: scrumptious, double pork chop: very good with kind of an applesauce, beer butt chicken: very good various wines were all good, a bit pricey (is that a shock anymore?!), on desserts. pretty noisy even on the patio and on a weeknight (is THAT a surprise anymore?!). good experience, will definitely go back - maybe lunch the next time."}
{"text":"I love the food but the service is so so. Last week the server overcharged all of our happy hour drinks. I thought I try to go again tonight.  I walk in, half the tables are empty but the hostess will only sit us by the bus station or kitchen door. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"Seriously the best food we have ever had and well worth the price. Plus the staff was so nice and attentive. We can't wait to go back! The hassleback potatoes were good, but the twice baked potatoes were AMAZING."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour and we're super impressed. The atmosphere is fun and nice, yet still casual. The food and drinks were a great deal on happy hour and we definitely plan to come back for dinner! After hh we went upstairs to Honor Amongst Thieves which is a speakeasy style bar that was super convenient!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice and have had drinks upstairs multiple times. The food menu is fantastic. Service has been excellent every time we have been and the drinks are great. We have done everything from a business lunch to a date night dinner to drinks with friends. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"7 of us went to have Brunch on a Saturday at Stock and Stable on 7th Street. Since this is a new restaurant we decided to forgo our favorite Brunch stops and try out Stock and Stable. When we arrived there was one table outside and one table occupied inside. The service was slow and it took a while to get our drink order of Bloody Mary's. The Bloody Mary's came with a  1/2 of sausage link and a lime in a low ball glass. Not what I was expecting but they were good and spicy. For Brunch I ordered the Steak and Eggs and the Steak to be cooked at Medium and the Eggs over Medium. When my plate arrived the Steak was Rare and the Eggs were runny. I will occasionally eat a rare Steak if the flavor is good and the meat is tender, however there wasn't any flavor and the Steak was a little tough. Not what I was expecting from a Restaurant called Stock and Stable and the d√©cor showing Cows. Speaking of the D√©cor the Blue tile surrounding the Bar looked awesome. A few other dishes that were not up to par were the Croque Madame and Biscuits and Gravy. The Croque Madame didn't have enough Pork Shoulder in the middle of the two pieces of thick bread and the Biscuits from the Biscuits and Gravy plate were dry even the gravy couldn't help. I understand that when a new restaurant opens up there are a few things that can improve but the food should come out of the kitchen with no flaws.  Maybe I may return to this Restaurant when it has been open for a while. Maybe..."}
{"text":"From beginning end, this place delivered! 

Awesome cocktails broken down by alcohol preference. 

Kung pow cauliflower and Caprese appetizers were on point. Flavorful and interesting. 

Filet and beer but chicken w street corn and fries to complete the meal. Filet was like butter, chicken was crispy and juicy, corn and parmesan fries were great compliments. 

A great birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Delicious at every turn. Bellinis. Awesome. Burgers. Nom nom! Only criticism is the bar is a little slow and not very intuitive of patron needs."}
{"text":"Food isn't the best quality, but it's edible. The service is good depending on who your server or bartender is. The first time I went the bartender seemed very unhappy to be there. Fortunately, his shift ended and we ended up with a great bartender. The atmosphere was awesome!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried Stock & Stable for the first time last night because we had heard from friends that it was really good, and they were definitely right. We didn't have a reservation, but were able to be seated outside right away, which was fine with me because I love sitting outside and they have a great patio. Even though it was over 100 degrees during the day yesterday, you couldn't tell here because they do a great job of keeping it cool without soaking you with misters.

Right away, we were really impressed with the draft beer list. They have a lot of lesser known options, and we were both able to try beer that we hadn't had before, recommended by our server, Andrew. Andrew was awesome, and gave us great recommendations on food as well. It was the best service we've had in a while, and he was actually honest with his opinions and told us when we asked about a menu option he didn't like :) 

For dinner, my boyfriend had the Beer Butt Chicken with a side of frites which he loved, and I had the Cubano. I hadn't really thought to get that myself, but I was trusting Andrew's recommendations and I was really glad I got it. So good! The frites are really good too, and are seasoned with rosemary and parmesan. 

At first, I thought this place seemed kind of expensive, but you get a ton of food for those prices, so it's really not bad. For happy hour (M-F 3-6p), they do $6 burger and fries, so I definitely want to come back for that! They also have a cocktail bar upstairs called Honor Amongst Thieves, which I can't wait to try. We don't really like cocktails so we were unsure, but Andrew let us know that they also serve all the beers that Stock & Stable has on draft."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try Stock & Stable for quite some time. They have a nice patio and the weather was just right so I thought I would give it a try. They have a nice selection of drinks. The price seemed a bit on the pricey side but they were well crafted and tasted great. We started with the Kung Pao Cauliflower. It was excellent! 

Next on to dinner. The Salmon was good. Descent portion cooked just right. 

I also ordered a NY Strip and this is where it went wrong. The price is $36 just for the steak and they served me a vein end NY Strip. Not only was the 10oz portion very small when you add the chewy connective tissue in the middle of that steak it was absolutely awful. I would expect any restaurant with a name like theirs to serve quality meat. What made it worse was the chef sliced the steak as part of the presentation. So if they didn't know it was a garbage piece of meat when they put it on the grill they should have noticed it when they cut the steak. Honestly I can go to a national chain restaurant and get a better steak with a side and a salad for a lot less than the cost of the dog food I was served.

Overall this place is trendy. They have a nice atmosphere and the service was excellent. My only complaint is their menu is overpriced for the quality of food I would expect from an establishment such as this one. I don't mind paying for a quality meal but this certainly wasn't quality."}
{"text":"I have heard so many mixed reactions to this place... It's fairly new and that being said, it's fairly slow. Personally I think they're cocktail options are poor. They have a separate menu for drinks however NONE of them looked appetizing and there weren't many to choose from. The wine list is even worse!! I wanted a glass of Ros√© which they had but they only sold it in a bottle.. I don't really understand that concept. The food was good! I got the cheeseburger but again I only had 2 options for cheese and only a few options for sides...
Amanda was our server and I thought she was awesome!! A couple of my friends didn't feel she was attentive enough on drinks but she was super sweet and answered the 10,000 questions we asked.
Lastly, they do have a very cool speakeasy themed bar upstairs. And by cool I mean literally.. It was freezing!!! My friends and I could barely stand being in there. 
I recommend trying it but I probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Great place for an intimate dinner as well as a night out with friends! Tried a few if their apps, including the Fermented Beets with heirloom carrots, goat cheese curds and almond butter, the Roasted Cauliflower with guanciale cream, herbs, breadcrumbs and an egg yolk jam, the Beef Tongue Pastrami and my personal favorite, the Lamb Agnolotti which was excellent!! Their Beer Butt Chicken was definitely my favorite of the scarce entr√©e selection, but the NY Steak and the Double Cut Pork Chop didn't disappoint, especially paired with the Tuscan Kale. As far as cocktails go, the Cottontail was my favorite of the few I tried, and the least favorite was the St. James Infirmary (a bit bold for my liking), all in all it's definitely a place we will revisit and a great addition to uptown. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I finally got to stop by Stock & Stable, and were quite impressed. 

The service was excellent. The AGM made a point to swing by and welcome us, and the servers were very attentive. And what a gorgeous restaurant, to boot! The beer list was also smartly chosen, too. Hard to do, nowadays.

A wonderful smoked corn manti to share was a great way to start. The manti was perfectly al dente with this ridiculous butter sauce. I could have licked this plate.

We also tried the jalape√±o popper, and these crazy people serve it with stuffed with a soft and melty marscapone mixture. It was pretty perfect. 

Then I got the fish, a black cod with this tasty tomato sauce with so much flavor. My fianc√© got the Cuban sandwich. He was happy with it. 
 
I would certainly come back for more. I am particularly interested in their brunch!"}
{"text":"Server was amazing - let me get that out of the way. He was great! But the food, wasn't super impressed with. I ordered the N.Y. steak and it tasted like it was burned. The parts that didn't taste burnt were way too salty. I got the steak sauce on the side, thinking it'd be like their own house made sauce. 99.9% sure it was just A1 sauce put in a small bowl. On top of that, you had to pay extra if you wanted a side to go with your meal. For how much I paid, I was not impressed. 

The saving graces for this place was their waitstaff, decor and their cool rooftop bar. Maybe come here for a drink but not for the food."}
{"text":"Scotty..... Serving is not a job for you. First of all, you do not know how to greet a table... 3rd time being there and this is the 2nd time you were our server. Both times were horrible. Today, we left without ordering because your service was the absolute worst. You refused to accommodate my mother's food allergy on mother's day out of all days....."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite meal that I crave at least once a week. I can't begin to describe how delicious and flavourful everything taste but it undoubtedly soothes my appetite. 
But first, I want to credit how amazing the service is from the host that takes my order over the phone, to the server that brings me water as I wait and to the bartenders that are extremely knowledgeable of their wines and very accommodating. 
I typically call in my order for pick up or I will have a glass of wine at the bar as I order my dinner to go. Although the ambiance of this place has an upscale trend and amazing bar, while at the same romantic with the lighting and rich dark wood... I always show up in my pajamas or gym clothes, head straight to the bar and receive the same cordial treatment as anyone else.
Note-the menu has changed a bit but still just as delicious is not better. The portions are extremely generous for the price and I always have left overs. The to go containers are pretty legit and dishwasher safe for reusing.  Definitely recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"Celebrated my wife's 30th birthday here with 13 of her close friends and family.  Over all the experience was enjoyable but there were a few issues along the way.

Setting up the event was simple and difficult all at the same time.  I set up the reservation with the gentleman that answered the phone for the group and he confirmed it but also said that a manager would have to call me back to fully confirm the reservation.  This was on a Thursday and Wednesday of the next week I still had not heard anything back, so I called to confirm the reservation.  I was transferred to the manager who told me that he had been on vacation, which is not a big deal but have someone else cover your job or have your staff let customers know it will be a week before they get a call back.

After talking to the manager he did confirm the event and told me that he would be sending an e-mail for confirmation right when we got off the phone.  I never received an e-mail (yes I checked the spam folder).  As I had already got confirmation over the phone I was not to worried but if you say you are going to email then send an email.

The day of the event went pretty well.  We had a single server for the table and he took care of everything with no issues at all, I wish I could remember his name, as he did an amazing jog..  They manager did put together some great whiskey tasting flights for the group and our food was all served at a single time, which is amazing for a table of 15.

My biggest issue was with the whiskey selection.  I chose Stock and Stable based on what they had listed on line for their whiskey selection (me and the wife are big whiskey drinkers) because we were planning on trying some really rare whiskies.  Unfortunately they literally only had 1 out of the 5 we were expecting to try.  Other then that everyone enjoyed the food and the atmosphere, I would say the price is a little high for what you get and have had better food other places for the same or less.

Overall the food and whiskey selection is a 3/5

The service while there is a 5/5"}
{"text":"Stock & Stable is an American Gastropub. They offer New American Cuisine that slants Italian on some of the offerings. The dining room is elegant and masculine with lots of dark wood and leather. There are many portraits of cows. It looks sort of steakhouse like to me. They also offer a large bar, traditional tables, benches, high tops and patio dining. 

We started out by sharing the Fermented Beets. The red and golden beets were very tasty and were tossed in an almond butter dressing along with crunchy fried goat cheese curds and lots of very crisp carrot ribbons. It was delicious all together. The carrots were raw but hard and crispy like maybe they were soaked in ice water and were just texture for the salad.

I had the Tuna Sandwich. It's enormous! (prepare to share or to take half home) It's very elevated tuna that's incredibly DELICIOUS and Spicy!!!!!!!!!!! THIS SANDWICH IS NOT your mom's tuna. THIS SANDWICH IS NOT FOR THE FAINT of heart.  They serve the tuna on what taste like thick sliced grilled Noble Bread. They add muenster cheese and Calabrian Aioli. It messy and full of lots of flavors! There are a lot of flavors going on. Really delicious and one of the best sandwiches I tasted all year! I picked the mixed green salad over the frites. They offer this Calabrian Vinaigrette that also is absolutely delicious and spicy. This plate is not for the masses. Really delicious and spicy!

The No Baloney (Mortadella) Sandwich is just ok and not as elevated as the tuna sandwich. The sandwich we got was like sliced lunch meat that was lightly grilled on both sides of the meat pile. It might have been more enjoyable if it was like a steak of mortadella that was caramelized on both sides. The sandwich is suppose to be spread with an unusual combination of maple mustard and chipotle herbed aioli. My husband asked for the sauces on the side. We both liked the taste of the chipotle herbed aioli but they seemed very strange together and we weren't sure about either flavor mixing with the mortadella. The sandwich came with tasty Frites that were nicely seasoned with fresh herbs and grated cheese. 

Tried the Key Lime Pie for dessert. It had a nice tender delicate graham crust. The filling was creamy and a little limey. It was topped with a generous serving of fresh made real whipped cream. 

Our server was friendly and efficient. He tried to get us to order the hamburger because they ground the beef in house and is a specialty here. I guess that explains the cow portraits.

Like from any other restaurant some things we liked better than other things.

3.5 stars rounded up because three out of four were winners!"}
{"text":"This is truly one of our fav places... fantastic brunch!!! Amazing Happy Hour! The most fabulous dinner and lunch! Yes, we have been here several times for all of these and keep going back. The bartenders ROCK!!! Especially Sam... The service is amazing. The steaks are to live for. The wine list is awesome. Affordable and approachable!!!!"}
{"text":"I came in yesterday morning for brunch. I love the decor. I grew up in the Midwest. The decor definitely reminded me of a rustic, country restaurant with a modern, dressed up flair. I loved the cow paintings! The $5 Bloody Mary was decent. Not amazing. The server was very attentive, funny, and knowledge about the menu. I had the Prosciutto Benedict. It looked small but was very filling. There was more prosciutto than expected and the flavors were in great. The ONLY issue- a benedict should come with a poached egg. This came with a (slightly) soft boiled egg. They are close but not the same thing. Poach it!!! I would recommend this place even though they don't know their eggs and I would even try it again!"}
{"text":"First, I love this new Colony area...when Pure opens up, this place will be poppin'.  GF and I went here for brunch on a Sunday. I ordered the crab benedict, she ordered the Belgian waffles. Drinks? Yes, I got the port of call and she got the eastern prayer (prob messing up the names, but you'll know which ones I mean). Anyway, my benedict was terrific! Lots of crab and shrimp with poached egg, hollandaise all over toast. I asked for Frank's red hot on the side, which I recommend if you want a kick. Her Belgian waffles were good, I tried them...a tad dry, but fresh blackberries were a nice touch. My drink was outstanding, I highly recommend during the summer. It was very refreshing, I could have had 2-3 more. I tried hers...it tastes like a spiked Thai iced tea, so yeah. Decor is homey, comfortable, what you'd expect from a trendy new spot in midtown. For my money, I'd hit up Daily Dose or Ocotillo before I went to S&S again. But I'll prob be back for dinner at some point."}
{"text":"Way too expensive, decent. French fries are called frites, but resemble Sisco frozen packs. Wings are good but difficult to eat. Sauce is weirdly plopped in middle. Cocktails are like every other \"craft menu.\" Seems as though they add champagne to classics or put anything bourbon and call it mixology. I want better for that much money spent."}
{"text":"We have been twice now and the food and service have been on point both times!  One of the best burgers I've had in Phoenix and the Philly egg roll app was amazing!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner when they first opened and I was not impressed.  However, gave them another chance for brunch and Whoo hoo!  So good.  They have an amazing selection of brunch items and I've been back so many times I tasted everything on the menu and it's all fab.  Highly recommend for brunch.  I have not been back for dinner but I may in the future."}
{"text":"The service was seriously wonderful! Every two minutes someone would come by and refill our water and make sure we had what we needed which was nice. The crowd was around 40-50 year olds. The menu was not huge but what we ordered was very good! The menu prices range from $14 to around $30, with most things being around $20. We got the Cubano sandwich and the burger and also split the philly steak egg rolls. The cubano was delicious! The poem was nice and tender and then bread was really chewy and good. The burger was really good as well. It was juicy and tender and had two patties with cheese melted in between. They forgot to put the egg rolls in and brought our dinner out first so the waiter comped the appetizer and brought them out with our dinner, which was very nice. They were also great- super cheesy and beefy and came with spicy mayo to dip them in. The waiter was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and all their drinks. Overall this place was good for a date night, just a little more expensive than I wanted!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ended up here after leaving another lunch spot because we didn't like their menu. I decided on the Hollywood & Vine cocktail and it blew me away! I love intriguing drinks and this one topped the chart. We arrived just in time to order the deviled egg dip, it was decent, needed a touch more flavor, as in salt or even mustard. We also shared the basic brisket cheeseburger and cauliflower appetizer, both were outstanding. The brisket burger had a ton of flavor, the french fries on the side were cooked to perfection. We will be back and I mean soon... like this weekend soon!"}
{"text":"Cute little place. Nicely decorated, friendly service, easy parking. Food was ok. I ordered the ribeye and a side of fries- a little charred on the outside and I have cooked better on my grill. Husband ordered the cod and loved it. Pretty expensive for what you are getting- $28 bucks a steak I would expect the side to be included, not extra. Overall fairly pricey for what you get, but cool atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Yumm! I can't wait to go back--though my wallet might not appreciate it. 

Stock and Stable is perfect for a trendy date night. So far, I have tried the Beer Butt Chicken ($16), the NY Steak ($21), and the Eggplant Parmesan ($12). While the Beer But Chicken is good, I don't exactly think it's worth the price--plus, since it's boned chicken, you might want to factor in how elegantly you can dissect boned chicken if you're out on a date. The NY Steak on the other hand, is hard to find fault in. It is well sized and comes with some amazing dipping sauces.

They have happy hour from 3-6pm, which serves as a great opportunity to try out some of their cocktails for $3 off.  My favorite drink so far is the perfectly sweet bourbon based cocktail called Church on Time ($11 Regularly/ $8 HH).

Also, if you're up for drinks after your meal, ask your waiter or bartender to show you how to get up to the speakeasy-style bar called Honor Amongst Thieves upstairs for some unique drinks."}
{"text":"This review reminds me of a Date- 
Stock & Stable being a really Hot Guy you've heard some positive things about and he definitely Looks intriguing, but upon Actually going out with the guy you realize he's really nothing substantial under the surface!! And dang it you really wanted to like him!!
Such is the case with Stock & Stable. Heard raves but the minute I stepped in the door it began to under impress. Hostesses were lackluster in their welcome while I stood waiting for a table to clear they made no effort to engage in conversation. The atmosphere was cool and had interesting details but you need to be able to hear your conversation. The restaurant isn't very well designed for buffering the noise- like a garage, the noise may not be bad when it's quiet but it was Friday so it was difficult to hear each other across our table! 
The food was interesting...most lacking the punch of what I have experienced elsewhere. Nice presentation on some meals but again nothing that Wowed me! I guess I may have been more excited about the experience if our server would have been more passionate about the menu and making his suggestions. Our meals weren't disappointing or bad but in this area restaurant competition is Tough and this establishment just isn't on point- perhaps they are still finding their groove. The pasta we shared was lovely but left my tastebuds disinterested. My Cuban sandwich was pleasant enough with the sweet pickle for contrast. My fianc√© had a burger that looks wonderful but it was greasy. My cocktail was delicious though. 
Again, genuinely bummed that we didn't hit it out of the park in this one cause I was super excited to check it out for Date Nights! With so many other interesting places to try I just don't know if I will be going back because we both left thinking...Marginal. And what's up with no Salt & Pepper?? We chuckled that maybe that would have Saved this review...our Tastebuds need coffee to wake up from their nap. 
Also, servers- you are an important factor of the evening! Your guidance, passion for the food and welcoming pleasant manner can determine the evening for customers. Perhaps if you were more engaging I would have enjoyed the evening more who knows??
If you follow my reviews you will see I'm usually very generous with stars- and I wanna be kind but 2 was all I could give 3 just seemed over generous."}
{"text":"The value alone makes this place a great choice and hangs up on your usual avenues in dining and drinking. 

The ambiance is spot on. A nice wrap around bar in the center and tables surrounding. Stop cooled down and pretty perfectly placed for a sundown drink. 

Ordered a lot so try and keep up. 
Port of call - perfectly balanced sweet coupe cocktail. 
Dog and pony show - quasi Moscow mule sub gin. Prob the easiest to drink when it's 100* out. A table favorite.
Carolina red - personal favorite. Most flavored cocktail, I could see this as a hit or miss for most. Not a new drinkers cocktail. This guy has some heart to it.
Solera gomez - Least favorite. But not bad, expected a tad bit more sweetness but had a touch too much bite for the group
Remember the Alamo Pitcher - They have cocktail pitchers, multiple choices too. Really great idea. Fun way to share and commune. Def jump down this road because it's served in a classy glass and packs a bunch of flavor and balance.

Roasted cauliflower - solid side dish. A good amount of salt, perfectly cooked cauli, good texture with the breadcrumbs. Could've used more of the cream sauce. That stuff was legit.
Salt cod tots - A fun little fish tater tot. A tad heavy on salt but two people at the table absolutely loved these. Ate every last bite.
****Beef tongue pastrami - By far my favorite dish. It's playful, full of flavor, perfectly cooked. I could eat this guy every day and still want more. ****
Potted crab - not good. Most pricey app but he least favorite. Texture was too wet and soft. Crab was lost in the mix. Wouldn't get again. But definitely didn't ruin the experience of the place.

Overall I loved stock and stable. Small personal preferences prob knocked them down the one star but I'd recommend it to anyone. I'll def be back and do another gauntlet of food and drink soon. There is still around 30 other dishes and drinks to try. See y'all soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for bunch.  Two words: vegetable hash.  Flavorful, balanced, delicious. Brunch drinks are real reasonable too."}
{"text":"Decor/ambiance is very nice. Most of the things we ordered were pretty good, but I feel I have to rate it overall as 3 stars given the price.  

Good/not bad orders: rib eye (10 oz, tasted like beef teriyaki), short ribs, chicken and mint salad, ny strip (came with a weird spicy green sauce on the side that was kind of unnecessary), side of mashed potatoes (smaller than you would think, but it's pretty rich/creamy/cheesy so it's satisfying. Just overpriced), brussels sprouts.

Less good orders: The fish of the day (Chilean sea bass) was overcooked and a little tough on the outside. Also its description includes baby clams and shrimp, but I think it's pur√©ed into tomato sauce because there were definitely no clams or shrimps on my plate. The Caesar salad was overpriced, the only good thing is that it comes with avocado toast. Would recommend the chicken and mint salad over it. 

It looks like this place has good happy hour deals that would make it worth coming here, but otherwise I think I could find food that tastes just as good for a better price elsewhere."}
{"text":"Soooo wanted to like this place...sadly it didn't happen. Great service!  Way over priced for the board...even for happy hour. Wasn't a great fan of anything we tried. Might try again, definitely for cocktails but food, not sure. Loved the open and decor restaurant."}
{"text":"The drinks were okay, and the food was mediocre at best. It's also expensive for what you get. I wouldn't recommend this place. There's a lot of other places that are better on 7th street."}
{"text":"Pros: 
Ambiance 
Kung pao cauliflower. Yum! 
Service (Aaron is the best server and he is the sole reason why this rating is four stars and not three)


Cons: 
Substitutions are \"politely declined\" by the chef. A little pretentious? 
Rosemary French fries leave a lot to be desired. They're soggy and not very rosemaryish."}
{"text":"Speakeasy bar upstairs is lovely... cozy, romantic hideout.  Food downstairs was ridiculously salty.  Spoke w/GM, he was awesome, but prob won't be dining there again.  Sorry, too many other choices out there.  A restaurant has to nail it every time to win my business."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a group of friends, and we had a ball. Julia and Jason took care of us. The cocktail menu was great with many delicious and interesting options. My hubby got the steak which he loved. I was getting my tuna casserole on, and it was just like grandma made, but better. I also heard there was a speak easy upstairs. When I figure out the password, you know I'll be checking it out."}
{"text":"We had brunch here for the first time and were very impressed! The decor is great! Huge bar, funky/comfortable furniture and eclectic livestock art!
The brunch menu is pretty concise and there's something on there for all palates. My wife had the Prosciutto Benny which was pretty good. It wasn't the best she's ever had, but she liked the pesto and arugula that was included and the sauce though quite pale was tasty. She found that the prosciutto was  a little too thickly sliced, and that there was slightly too much of it. (Never a complaint about too much from me!)
I had the Cubano sandwhich with a salad. It was really good! Generous portionof smoked pork and ham with lots of melted cheese and pickles. The bread for both dishes was perfect! Crispy crust, light fluffy inside and mine was toasted wonderfully and glazed with oil which I love! The salad was also a nice mix of leaves with a tasty and balanced vinaigrette. I was going to try their chicken-fried staek and egg, but it seems it's served a la carte without any sides. I asked if it came with any and was told that it was just the fried steak and egg on the plate. I suppose I could have added a side of fruit for $4 but I generally dislike fruit at brunch, being a savory kind of guy. I would have ordered that had it come with a handful of salad or slaw on the side, just so I could minimize any nutrition guilt. 
The only do French-Press coffee so don't expect to order an espresso or cappuccino, but the coffee was dark and flavorful. I had their iced tea which was fine. 
The Hostess was friendly and our server was also top-notch answering all of our questions. 
We are interested in seeing what this place will be like for dinner. I can imagine with a bar that huge there might be a bit of a scene developing there.
Once I try their dinner menu, I will update my review and possibly upgrade them to a 5-star."}
{"text":"We were totally caught off guard! Everything was decadently delicious. We couldn't of asked for better service or food.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a happy hour the other day. Not very many food options on the happy hour menu. They did have a burger and fries option for $8 and that is what I went for. The burger was pretty good, nothing super special but the fries were very crispy. My wife ordered their chicken and mint salad and that had really good flavor. It was basically like a chinese chicken salad, very good. We also got a side of the pesto mac n cheese. Pretty cheesy and had good flavor overall. Drinks were delicious. Their specialty cocktails are very balanced and not too sweet. Would definitely return to try some more things on the menu. Entrees are not cheap though so plan on spending some extra money here."}
{"text":"Really liked it, will definitely go back. I had the cubano, which was very good. My friend had the beer butt chicken - I wish I'd gotten that - amazing! The au gratin potatoes were to die for. The only negative was the deconstructed apple pie dessert, which was very bland. Great atmosphere. Friendly server. We went in a Thursday night, so noise and crowds were not a problem."}
{"text":"QUALITY is the best word to describe this place 

The drinks were very well done. 

The service was on point even for a busy Friday 
 night 

The food quality... Fork tender premium cuts of meat cooked perfectly and farm fresh (super high quality) veggies... Need I say more? 
 
Well done for a brand new restaurant still barely open a full season.  I say this because new restaurants always have kinks to work out as does this one, I'm sure. But to be so young and still manage to impress is deserving of the high rating.  I'm so glad to see someone finally do something different!! If I see another pizza place going up in central Phoenix, I am going to lose my mind!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a business dinner , atmosphere was very nice and service was great. 
Had the NY strip , casesar salad and egg rolls 
The steak and egg rolls were amazing ! the caesar is more of a wedge salad with 3-4 big pieces of salad , needed more dressing and wasn't a typical caesar. I would say this wasn't up to par with the rest of the food. Will definitely come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"We dined here tonight and had an awful experience. For starters we are in the restaurant industry so we are very understanding, and we especially understand how customer service is supposed to be handled. We ordered our apps and received them after we put our entrees in. Our appetizers tasted spoiled rotten to the point we had to spit it out. This was our first dining experience and having such a bad experience with our starters made us feel concerned about how our entrees would taste. Mind you, all of this tasting of the appetizers happened right after we took our order. We were so disgusted we didn't want to eat any other food for the potential risk of receiving our entrees which would contain similar ingredients our appetizers consisted of and did not want to risk having to feel displeased nor waste any food. Instantly we tried to notify our server because we didn't want the food to be prepared and wasted. We couldn't see her so we grabbed the first person we could find and let him know we needed to cancel our order before it was started. We let them know it's nothing they did personally, we however would like to cancel our order. Our server then came out afterwards and confirmed we needed to cancel our orders and we apologized for any inconvenience. We would like to mention we felt embarrassed for even having to do this because it is an uncomfortable situation to be in. After this situation happened, next the gentleman we notified of our issues and decided to come back to our table and inform us he was thankful we cancelled our order because he was thankful he could order it because \"it was awesome\". His comment was very rude, passive aggressive, and unnecessary. We already felt rude for having to cancel and the comment he left was very unprofessional. I spoke with the manager on shift and he was very kind. This team needs to learn how to give proper customer service because how situations are handled truly influence whether or not we would return, and as of now we will not return nor recommend this place."}
{"text":"The service was amazing our waiter was really friendly and knew the menu very well. The food was pretty okay I ordered the pork with the stuffed peaches and my boyfriend ordered the chicken; both meats were dry but the pork had a little sauce that helped. The one thing here though that you must try is the roasted cauliflower is amazing and made the overall entire meal I probably would've gave this place a 2-2 1/2 stars if it wasn't for the server and the cauliflower."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times I'm not sure how I haven't reviewed it before! I love coming here for a quick happy hour (Monday-Friday 3-6pm) featuring $3 craft cocktails, $5 well drinks, select wines, and beers as well as half off appetizers. I personally love the Busty Lou {Absolut Vodka | Pampelmousse | Fresh Lemon Juice | Champagne} let's be real, anything with champagne is going to be great! A must order appetizer is the kung pow cauliflower with cashews, cilantro, and bell peppers- I don't know what it is about it but its a fabulous flavor explosion in your mouth. Most recently I ordered the burrata and tomato appetizer and my server was kind enough to remind me that the tomato is a jam that is spread on the toast and not an actual tomato. Yes, it is stated on the menu but I definitely missed it and it's always nice to have servers who look out for their customers (however illiterate we may be!) The presentation was great and the creamy burrata was fresh and delicious. I will continue to come here and encourage you to as well!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, once for brunch and another for happy hour. 5 stars for service for sure, you get orders right away, drinks are cheap, bartenders keep you company. Food is good, I recommend the lamb ravioli"}
{"text":"The wife and I went to Stock and Stable for the first time for a date night.  We have a 2.5 year old and 5 month old so our date nights are sporadic and treasured, but we were happy we went here.  

The interior is dimly lit and felt speakeasy-esque, which I liked a lot.  The service and food were both excellent.

We started with the dirty fries and they were amazing.  My wife got the cheeseburger and I got the crispy chicken sandwich and we were both very happy with our choices.  Even now, I'm eating the second half of the sandwich a day later, reheated in the microwave, and it's tasty enough to motivate me to write this review.

Drink-wise, my wife got a couple of glasses of white wine and had the rambling man.  You might balk at a peach/whisky drink, but this was amazing.  I'm no somm, but I enjoyed every last bit of my glass.

All in all, we had a great experience and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a friends birthday party and enjoyed a nice meal and a couple drinks. For dinner, I settled on the butt chicken which was told to me to be one of the more popular dishes. I did enjoy the chicken with its citrus and herb flavor. The portion was good and was glad I ordered it.  I added a side of asparagus to go with the chicken and the taste was on point. Many tried it and concurred. Now if I could just accept the $6 price point.  For drinks, I had the Mission Hard Root Beer and tried my buddies Smith and Wesson pitcher.  The root beer was great and would order again for sure.  The Smith and Wesson was okay but doubt I would order in the  future. Many drinks to choose from here so there is no need to settle. The setting and staff were great and we all had a very nice evening.  I would stop by again but avoid dropping $6 for asparagus."}
{"text":"Went to S&S for lunch today and our group of 4 enjoyed it. It's a really hip, attractive space. The dining room as big sliding doors that open it up to a nice patio area.

Service was solid and the food was tasty. I had the Cuban sandwich and was impressed: thick, buttery slices of delicious bread stuffed with ample amounts of pork and cheese, along with mustard and pickles. Yum. Served with a generous amount of fries. It was $12 so a little pricey for a sandwich at lunch, but I left full. The salad eaters at my table were happy with their meals as well."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a few friends. Food was not what I expected.  Very greasy and almost diner like in its preparation. I had higher expectations based on the prices. Not really worth the price."}
{"text":"Having a great dinner I have no complaints about the food which is amazing but our server... SHOUT OUT TO AMANDA who is AMAZING, thank u for all the genuine service... Only suggestion...maybe do an amber ale on draft ;-)"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite brunch places! The shrimp and crab benedict is delicious! Staff is always very friendly. Coffee is great."}
{"text":"Nice ambience. Stock & Stable is located in an upscale, up-and-coming area of Phoenix. If you sit outdoors on their posh patio, you'll also have a view of the Circle K gas station down the street. It's kind of unique in an endearing way. They have a great beer and wine list, though the selections for food seemed a little narrow and heavy. Restaurant was much quieter than the other places nearby. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love the cocktails here.  Bourbon with blackberries - heck yeah.  Gin with lavender infused ice cube - give me one.  A drink made with cotton candy - sold.  The salumi board is nice to snack on while drinking but the kung pao cauliflower is easily my favorite."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for happy hour and we were both surprised by both the quality of food/drink and the prices. We were able to get great appetizers for a decent price with a great atmosphere. After 6pm the upstairs bar turns into a cozy retro lounge area that we were extremely impressed with. The service is amazing."}
{"text":"Super delicious food! I'm sure our waiter felt like I was grilling him but all of their food choices sounded so good that I had to ask lots of questions. I didn't know which route we should go down: lots of small plates (which are hearty portions BTW) or a small plate and entree. The hubs and I ended up starting with two of their specialty cocktails: I had the Busty Lou (in honor of my ample bust-not) and he went with the Sonoran sunset. Mine was better it was grapefruity and I dig the hell out of grapefruit. The hubs's cocktail was almondy and I like to eat almonds not drink them--can't handle that.

Anyway to the food! We shared the jalape√±o popper and the linguine. The popper was less of a popper and more of a torpedo. Big, but great flavors. Don't expect it to be your run of the mill TGIF frozen jalape√±o popper because it's not. It's so much better than your average popper so respect. The linguine was phenom. I wanted to put the leftover broth into a coffee mug and take it to the house. But I didn't want to embarrass the Hubs. Our salad course was good too! I love a good panzanella salad and this one was top notch! I'm not crazy about burrata like some people are so I would have enjoyed this salad more without it but whatever.

The NY steak was perfectly prepared and seasoned. So good. That's really all you need to know about that. The frites are more like your traditional French fry. IMO if you are going to call a potato product a frites they have to be like matchsticks. The mushroom side was really solid.

And let me not forget their fricken awesome 80s music station that they are tuned to. I could sit there all night and get lit up listening to Hall and Oates do their thing. Super solid music going on."}
{"text":"Super close to my office and currently our go-to spot for a Friday happy hour! The bartenders & servers are also super friendly & their happy hour bites are some of the best"}
{"text":"We've earn here for both dinner, and brunch. Neither disappointed. For dinner, we sat at the bar, and tried an assortment of things. Both bartenders wanted to make sure we enjoyed our time. I ate the Cuban sandwich, and loved it. 

After dinner, one of the bartenders walked us upstairs to Honor Amongst Thieves. We had some cocktails there, too, and really enjoyed our time. 

Today we went back to Stock and Stable for brunch, and had a great time! I got some coffee, which came by French press. It was awesome. Ordered the biscuits and gravy - which is one of the best I've ever had. Definitely looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely not for vegetarians. There only veggie option is a salad and a few appetizers. I ordered the crab Mac and cheese, with the option to take the crab out. It tasted a little funky but I was told there was no meat. Minutes later my face and body had swelled and became covered in hives. Paid and left to get a benadryl. Love the drinks but probably wouldn't eat there again"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and a great date night ambiance! Small and intimate for sure . Love the wine list that was affordable. Please ask for the wine list ...also the plates of the small braised beef and the beer butt chicken (lol) plate were top notch!  The service was ultra quick that our plates came out in ten minutes or less! Love it !"}
{"text":"Awesome place great ambiance! Our waiter Lorenzo was amazing!! The green beans rock and so does creative drink menu!"}
{"text":"Met up with a friend for lunch here while visiting Phoenix for the weekend. The food was great and very fresh. Service was friendly & quick!"}
{"text":"So disappointed   As a regular patron of this establishment so sad the pork chop is now gone. I ordered the new one. It was dry and unappealing.  Also instead if us both ordering the pork chop we ordered the salmon which was also dry and not great.  So so disappointed as this has become one of our fave places to frequent. Now. Not so much. Too bad stick and stable. Sometimes change is t the right thing to do."}
{"text":"This is officially my favorite restaurant in Phoenix! Where to start? I asked about gluten and our server, Jeremy, told me they could pretty much make anything not requiring gluten work for me. S,o no linguine, but lots of stuff on the menu is gluten-free without modification. We started with the white bean hummus which came with an delicious mountain of very fresh vegetables; the mixed carrots were like candy. This might sound like a weird complaint, but there were so many veggies that we could have used more hummus. (The hummus itself could have been a tiny bit zingier.) I'm doing whining; everything else was perfect. I had the perfectly cooked pork chop. The herby butter sauce was sinfully delicious. My husband had the Caesar salad with chicken. About the dressing he said, \"It has so much garlic in it, it ought to be illegal.\" We shared the grilled asparagus which must have been prepared over a wood fire because it was distinctly smoky, a good thing in my view. We shared a bottle of the Ano Verde Pinot noir. It was as good as any Pinot noir I've ever had, and at $40, a very good value. And then we discovered that bottles are half off on Mondays and Tuesdays, so we only paid $20 for it! We didn't have room for dessert, so obviously we'll have to go back. (Hint to my husband) I love the decor and they were playing blues, but not so loud that we couldn't talk. Jeremy provided excellent and charming service, and then at the end of dinner, showed us upstairs to the speakeasy. Another patron told us it's crazy busy on Friday and Saturday, but it was delightful on a Monday night. And we discovered white port; who knew such a thing existed? Definitely have to go back."}
{"text":"Good food. 
Overpriced cocktails. 
Decent service
The layout is a little odd. Crowded speak easy upstairs around the back. 
Not a bad place. But not one of our top spots. 
We wish the EEG Entertainment group would've replaced this place instead of Casa Anejo next door."}
{"text":"A friend and I visited for dinner on July 19th - this was our first visit.  We normally go to Culinary Dropout just down the street.

Parking:  We arrived at 5:30 p.m. and there was plenty of parking in the huge lot behind the restaurant.  Did not see any valet service so not sure if that is available.

Service:  We were immediately sat at a table near the bar.  Our waiter (Matt) was excellent!  Other staff members that we came into contact with were very friendly.

Food:  I had the Double Cut Pork Chop.  There were two rib bones - everywhere else I've had a DCPC it has been only one - no big deal at all.  It was served with a mixture of peaches and onions on top.  My 'mental picture' when looking at the menu was one of having grilled peach halves on the plate beside the pork chop, with the pork chop showing the grill marks.  Although the presentation did not match my 'mental picture' - it was o.k. and very delicious.  The pork chop alone was $19.00 - would expect that there would be a side item included (don't really consider the peach/onion topping to be a side).  Ordered the Asparagus ($6.00) and the Frites ($6.00) as sides.  Had the Blackberry Tart ($6.00) for dessert - the crust was like a brick; you could not cut it with a fork or even a knife so I just ate the lemon custard & blackberries.  My friend had the Tuna Sandwich with Frites ($12.00) and he stated both were tasty.

I rated this experience as 3 stars instead of 4 as I'm not yet a 'fan' - while the service was great and the decor nice, just sort of feel that it was a bit over-priced for the food value received.  I'll give it another try and then update this review as needed."}
{"text":"QCame here for happy hour and ordered everything from the cauliflower up. Not a bad thing on the happy hour menu. I had a delicious Stout my wife had a great Chardonnay.
 The food was delicious. We really enjoyed the above-mentioned cauliflower  and the cheese steak  egg rolls  interesting and tasty. Morgan was delightful, the service was great.  The atmosphere is welcoming and cozy , we were not being beaten to death by the music. 
Will definitely be back with more friends and family."}
{"text":"amazing food.  Loved the beer butt chicken and the mashed potatoes.   

The salmon was not as flavorful but what was under it totally made up for it.   The taste exploded off the fork.  Amazing 

We will be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Brunch was very delicious, I ordered their \"Grilled Cheeseburger\" and a Bloody Mary. Soft buns, juicy patties, crunchy pickles and crispy lettuce. The Bloody Mary was very tasty as well. Just enough alcohol and spices."}
{"text":"Decent new restaurant. Waiter was ok. Ambiance was nice, a bit on the louder side though. Outside patio looks really nice and would be perfect for fall/spring when it's not too hot out."}
{"text":"It use to be really good. My partner and I went there a lot. Recently they have changed. I get Their Cuban sandwich a lot. Even though it is not much like a real Cuban sandwich , it was pretty good! It was full of sliced Pork, Ham and Cheese. Now, They have changed the bread, have put a little pulled pork,  and I mean a little ,some cheese with their pickles and mustard, and that is it. I am very Disappointed!  Also they have now raised their prices! They also have added their Pork Chop back on the Menu, but it is no longer stuffed. I have not tried it. I probably won't at this point!   Sorry guys! If it was Great Don't Fix It!"}
{"text":"great roasted turkey sandwich and salad...so much flavor!  kind service and excellent cocktail, I love the taste of mescal in my shaken and up drink.   I will be back for a great looking happy hour and will give the 5 stars then"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! The food was incredible. The cocktails were likewise awesome. If you are looking for a \"fun\" cocktail this is where to come! Five stars!!"}
{"text":"Yep, only two stars from me for this place. My friends and I were so excited to try this place after talking about it for weeks. 

Being on Open Table-5 stars
Building/restaurant itself-5 stars
Hostess-5 stars
Service-5 stars
Food-1 star

Sure, that should probably bring it up to a better star average, but it's really about the food every time right?  Party of 4, we liked 1 out of the 5 dishes we ordered and shared. 

Started off with the potted crab and the roasted cauliflower. The potted crab is basically a crab dip served with grilled bread. The bread is from an outside source which is a thick sliced white/sourdough type. The potted crab was a pot of crap! Hardly any crab flavor let alone any flavor at all. Not even any spices. 

The roasted cauliflower was even worse. What really disappointed me in the cauliflower was that our server recommended it over another side that I wanted to try. She even said \"oh the cauliflower is the way to go because of how flavorful it is\". Did she mean it was the least flavorful? I hate to say that too because our server was really good. 

Moving on to the main events. Two of us had the NY steak, another had the chicken sandwich and I had the Cuban sandwich. 

The steaks were served sliced. I actually love this concept and it reminds me of a famous place in New York (I have a personal rule against naming another restaurant when writing reviews no matter how poor). I was so excited for the first bite and again was let down. Zero flavor, not even any salt and what was worse was all the fat and gristle, like hard gristle. Gross! It was like this on both steaks! 

As for my Cuban sandwich, it was decent. I think the bread they used is the wrong choice as it's just over powering and takes away from the important stuff between those two slices! 

The winner was the chicken sandwich. Fried chicken breast with sweet and spicy toppings. The bread for this one is a bun which nicely complimented the important stuff! 

As I said, we liked 1 out of 5 dishes. That's pretty disappointing. I think simply adding some salt to a few of those dishes would have helped. Speaking of which, what is with these trendy places not having salt and pepper on the tables? Your food is not that good, get over yourself! 

Sorry Stock & Stable!  Look at your reviews, people like your place but hate your flavorless food!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here! Got the buttermilk chicken biscuit, reallyyyyy good! A little dry, would probably ask for more syrup next time, but the biscuit was almost as soft as a pancake and the chicken was great! Mimosas are really good!! Friend got the crab eggs Benedict and didn't love it. Not a lot of crab, and the sauce was a little weird, more like a bisque."}
{"text":"Didn't eat there but the drinks were amazing. I told the bartender I love St Germaine and he made me a drink on the spot. That's a good bar tender!
Awesome drinks and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our first time. What a great restaurant! David took such great care of us. He really understood the menu in great depth, asked probing questions to match the perfect meal to our palettes. The special of the day, a wild caught halibut was Divine! Chef Joe knows how to cook fish beautifully. The asparagus was so delicious. And their wine selection is diverse. They made date night extra special. We will be back again and again! Thank you David, thank you Joe! And thank you Pedro for your attention to detail and Claire for your wonderful recommendations!"}
{"text":"This place is esthetically pleasing. Although the food and drinks aren't quite up to par. The patio seating area is nice, when there aren't bugs flying around. Nice addition to the growing uptown Phoenix area."}
{"text":"They have a decent happy hour with more than one wine to choose from.  The burger and fries for $6 is a great deal.

The menu tries too hard to be trendy but the staff is super friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Super hospitable staff opened up the restaurant to us even though their soft opening isn't until Monday! Tried the salmon entree with pea pur√©e, strawberry spinach salad with walnuts and goat cheese and that was after opening with yummy charred broccoli and gluten free mac and cheese- creamy and delicious! Can't wait to return when they actually open!"}
{"text":"I am only writing this bad review because yesterday my boyfriend and I tried to go to Stock and Stable, and we were both actually pretty excited to try this place. We knew it was a Saturday afternoon/evening so we went online through their website and even made reservations. Then when we showed up they told us they were closed because someone bought out the restaurant for an event. We were both pretty disappointed especially because we made reservations and then drove from Tempe.  As much as I wanted to try it, I highly doubt I will go back. How will I know that I won't show up again just to be shoo-ed away. If you are thinking about going to this place, I would suggest calling ahead to make sure you can actually eat there....even if you make reservations."}
{"text":"This was a great find. The ambience is modern and interesting. The staff is young and hip and very pleasant.  The food was delicious. We had the salami board. We would have liked a little more cheese but otherwise it was yummy. My husband had the double cut pork chop and I had the spinach salad. Both were excellent. The pork chop was cooked perfectly and the salad was very flavorful.  For dessert we had the chocolate peanut butter mouse. We would have liked it fluffier and more airy with more peanut butter flavor, but never the less it was delicious. We will be back for sure. I am hoping for a perfect chocolate martini with my next meal."}
{"text":"I had the veggie hash with avacado and a poached egg with a side of toast, and coffee.  The service was great our waiter was phenomenal, and the food was beyond good. Ate it before thinking to photograph."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. My husband and I went there on a date night. They had a great bourban selection. The food was very great! The atmosphere was pleasant. The service was good. I would definitely recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"Had the best dining experience in my 14 years living here in the valley. Our waiter Ian was amazing!!! We ordered appetizers and an entree that we would not normally order, but did so per the recommendation of Ian. 

Everything came out tasting fantastic!!! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Not sure where to start, as this was an early birthday celebration for me and I was excited as I had never been here. My friends made a reservation for us and we walked in and got seated right away. Started off with a bottle of bubbly, I think it was LaLuca Prosecco and that simply just hit the spot. For our appetizers we got the Kung Pao cauliflower and the Frutti Di Mare. Both were simply amazing. The cauliflower was exceptional if I may add. 

For dinner we switched to a bottle of red (unfortunately don't remember the name) and for my dinner I got the the Rib Eye, and my friends got the Bolognese and the Hot fried chicken. Everything was just done tastefully and was delicious. 

Server was very friendly, very attentive and took good care of us. The manager also stopped by when dropping off food and said hello. Nice staff overall. 

For desert we got a piece of this crazy flavorful cheese cake that made me want more. The restaurant made it special and put a candle on it. This was an amazing 

Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for a recent meeting, we decided to check this place out as it was local and not a chain / really glad we did!

The service was fast and friendly; the real standout here however was the food!! In true gastropub style this was innovative and delicious!

Our group of 5 decided to order a bunch of appetizers; the white bean hummus was delicious ( it looks a bit thin but more than makes up for this in taste ), the Shishito  peppers were great, but the two standouts were the Kung Pao cauliflower, we ended up with a second of that one and even our one non adventurous eater enjoyed this fish assuming it was chicken and not an actual
Veggie!! And the seafood plate was a surprise - more of a ceviche and so fresh and delicious!

The appetizers were so good we just kept ordering more and skipped the mains entirely. Good beer and wine selection to wash the food down and placed looks great with a nice low key vibe"}
{"text":"First time here I had a fancy drink it was a little pricy!! But then we went down stairs I had the most delicious twice baked potato and hummus with veggies dish !! The service was fast food was good the ambiance lovely ! It's a great place to meet up with friends ! I'll definitely be back and dreaming of that potato!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! Great atmosphere, drinks, food and service!! Sat at the bar and the bartenders were so much fun, social and gave great recommendations. Definitely try the Whiskey Sour and the Philly Cheeze Steak Egg Rolls."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch last Saturday. Possibly is result of being a new restaurant or perhaps the \"C\" team was on staff but visit was pretty disappointing.
Music was way too loud. Service sub-par. 105 degrees out and had to ask twice for ice in tea.
Ordered the crispy chicken sandwich -- this was a pre made chicken patty on store-bought bun. (Was told use Noble Bread on other sandwiches so expected a bit more from buns) At least the pickles were good.
My friend ordered the burger--again, store-bought bun and was told could not cook beef to temperature. For a place touting 'Stock and Stable' expecting a rock-star level burger. Would have had better sandwiches from Chick-Fil-A and In-N-Out.
Definitely not the quality product have come to expect based on other restaurants in the area. Hope they get it turned around as this is an interesting concept with potential to be great."}
{"text":"Was not thrilled with this place. Came in looking very much forward, and was met by excellent Decour and a nice atmosphere. We were seated promptly, but then it took about 15 minutes to be served water. The waiter claimed that there was confusion between who had our table. This is with the restaurant not even a quarter full.

The no substitutions thing I can understand, but if you're paying $15 for a sandwich, you should be able to swap a side for an up charge and not have to pay the full price. It's not that upscale of a restaurant to demand such a thing.

There is an aura of attitude that is not yet deserved.

The wine selection, while interesting, is very limited; they did not offer a Pinot Noir. In addition, there were no flavored (limon, raspberry, etc.) vodkas.

My meal was indeed tasty, but nothing incredibly special. The fries with truffle and Parmesan were good, but not the best I've had.

It's a new restaurant, and I think with time they will work some of the kinks out. I would recommend waiting until then to eat here. 

Will try something else next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The service was really great and the prices are not bad for such a nice restaurant! Our waiter (I forget his name but he was very flamboyant and sweet) got me a free dessert (a yummy warm brownie) for my birthday even though it was a week away and was super personable! The fries my friend got with his burger were sooo yummy but my bolognese pasta was even better! My friend works for the same company that owns it and they gave us a discount as well. Very great service!"}
{"text":"Meh. Service was't too good. Server definitely made us feel like we were an inconvenience. Gee. If I didn't know better, I'd think she was paid to serve . Food was OK, but the prices are a little high. So many choices in that area I think I'll pass on Stock and Stable and try somewhere new."}
{"text":"This was a great lunch choice for my business meeting.  The crowd was mostly professionals at lunch meetings it appeared. I had the Cuban Sandwich with a side salad. It was amazing and full of flavor. Frankly, I could have taken half of the sandwich home but I choose to eat instead. (So much for portion control). 

The service was fast and the server was on top of her game, even with a large group being there. 

I would recommend the patio if possible as it is fully covered and gives this venue a SoCal vibe. 

There is also a full bar which I didn't have a chance to try, but I will looking forward to sampling the offering in the future. 

Check out this great spot!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!

Been talking about this place for a bit and finally decided tonight was the night. Wow what a great night. Only thing that could spoil it is thinking how lame I've been for not trying it sooner. 

To start we had the lobster mac and cheese. So creamy and a slight hint of lemon. The only thing that could make this better is if they threw in a couple pieces of crusty bread to mop up the sauce with. Felt a sin to waste such cheesy creamy greatness. 

On to dinner...I went with the braised short rib. So you know when you order food in a large group and you look across the table and notice someone's dish? That feeling of food envy that washes over you? Well this was that dish!  The blend of flavors was super and it was pretty to look at as well.  Order this!!

My friend got the New York strip. It was sooo yummy. Cooked perfect. He also went with the asparagus. I love asparagus any day but this dish was extra good. The smoke on the grill added just enough flavor to really set it off. 

As if that wasn't enough I saw the dessert board and on it was \"affogato\". What is this I wondered?  Isn't gato equal to cat?  Hmm what kind of dessert has cat?  Turns out it's marscapone ice cream and you pour fresh French press coffee over. OH MY. Why isn't this on my breakfast menu?  The man the chocolate cake. It was so warm and gooey. 

Oh wait, our server Arron was awesome for sure. Very knowledgeable about the food and attentive enough without being a pest. 

I'll be back here for sure. Hardest part will be trying something new when what I ordered was the ultimate in goodness."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich is sooooo good! Our server was attentive. We will definitely be going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Gonna keep this short and sweet. We have been meaning to make it there and why didn't we get there sooner? Didn't get to tell a manager this so if you're listening.... Well done!!!! Food is so fresh and the flavors compliment each dish. We will definitely be back! Recommend: Sweet and sour meatballs."}
{"text":"We had a delicious brunch here!! I can't speak for dinner, and I do agree the brunch menu was slightly limited - buuuuut better to do a few things GREAT than many things AVERAGE, right? :)

Everything was super yummy, I had the chicken and biscuit (see photos) and loved it. Service was quick, split checks without a problem, and the location and patio are adorable.

Highly recommend sitting outside, it is kept well-cooled for Arizona. They do take reservations which is a plus, though it wasn't super busy (I heard they are more popular for happy hour, and we did see an extensive drink list!).

Hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"We had the cheeseburger with fries (frites) and cubano sandwich with a salad and we were all very happy and satisfied with the portions and taste. This is a cool place."}
{"text":"Yay!  A new restaurant that was spot on when it opened. Great ambiance, friendly staff, great service and good food. A friend and I ate lunch here today. We had the roasted cauliflower and split a Cubano sandwich. Cauliflower was tasty.  The sandwich was great -  toasty bread, ample meat.  Crisp waffle fries were delicious.  Definitely a treat. Can't wait to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Frutti Del mare and Noble Bread makes a great light lunch. Ask for Aaron. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Despite some so-so reviews, my husband and I decided to give this place a try over the weekend and we loved it!!  Yes, I would agree that it is pretty loud, but gives it a fun vibe.  I am sure it will improve once the weather improves and they can open the restaurant up more.  

We had the spinach salad which was pretty good.  Split the cubano sandwich was absolutely delicious!!!  Would go back just for that...fries that came with it were awesome.

We sat at the bar and had excellent service.  Got our drinks right away and thought the food cam out quickly...everyone who waited on us were great.  Then we headed up stairs to the bar. AWESOME and will definitely be back.  Decor in restaurant and the bar were well done.  Very excited for a fun new bar in the area!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Menu overpriced for sub par food. None of us were impressed by our meal. But shocked how much they charged. Next time I'll just get drinks."}
{"text":"Last night was my second time dining at Stock & Stable.  I wouldn't have returned after the first dining experience, but was invited as a guest of a friend and wanted to be polite.  The first time I dined there with friends, the service was horrible.  One of them had a dairy allergy which he advised the server about when he ordered. Later he asked about the fries and she told him there was parmesan cheese on them.  This really alarmed him and he reminded her that he has a dairy allergy and asked her to confirm whether they put parmesan on the fries.  Instead of being helpful, the server gave him a dirty look and walked away.  We had to seek the chef ourselves.  

Unfortunately, the service was horribly slow last night.  The restaurant wasn't that busy.  Server was nice, but very slow and needs training. We waited a long time for our cocktails.  Then we waited a long time for him to take our food order.  When food was served, we were missing a napkin and silverware, but server never brought one and we had to go get one from another table.  The server never checked back to ensure our food was okay.  One of our diners ordered her food to go and asked for a separate check.  Server never brought her check and so she finally had to leave and we covered her portion.

I think this place needs to change its management if it hopes to survive.  The server that we had last night needs training and the server from the first experience needs to be replaced."}
{"text":"Everything was overtop amazing, especially Kung Pao Cauliflower.  However, the salmon had such a fish taste/essence to it that it turned my stomach & couldn't get the taste out of my mouth.  My friend was embarrassed I said something & she said \"don't worry about it.\"  However, they really should have done something as I physically couldn't eat it.  I will go back despite this - just for that Kung Palo cauliflower."}
{"text":"Nicer additon to Uptown :) Happy that they supported Wilde Meyer Gallery for their artwork.

 For opening night,  the service and staff were very knowledgeable and helpful...  Great cocktails!..  I ate the fermented beet dish and I was very satisfied with.  I look forward to my second visit."}
{"text":"Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Stables? Just kidding, this ain't no Guy Ritchie production but they do serve some tasty brunch! It wasn't too busy around noon on Sunday when we ate here which made for a pleasant and relaxing atmosphere for enjoying our meals. 

After browsing through the menu I decided on the shrimp and crab benedict ($13) and a Stumptown cold brew ($5). The more I drink cold brew coffee the more I'm thinking I don't like it? Most times I've had it I encounter a bit of a sour flavor profile in the coffee which I have to mask by using multiple packets of sugar. This was the case today, as I had to ask for a basket of sweetener to make the brew more palatable for me. The sweeteners they offer here btw are honey crystals, stevia, and regular sugar (I think it was Sugar in the Raw). 

I did enjoy the benedict though. It was beautifully presented, with a well balanced portion of shrimp and crab with eggs, arugula, and some thick toasted bread on the bottom instead of English muffin. The combination of the creamy Hollandaise sauce with the peppery arugula, preserved lemon, and the natural sweetness of the crab and shrimp was nice. The eggs could have been a bit more runny for my tastes but that was just a minor point. 

Service was decent and we were checked up on as needed.

If I were in the area again and looking for a good place for brunch this would be a good option."}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant with a patio! Don't worry,  the patio has misters AND fans. I was actually cold in the summer sitting outside!! 

Came here during restaurant week, so I was able to try several different things. I started off with the Kung pow cauliflower. This was fantastic. It's breaded and soaked in their Kung pow sauce and served with peppers. Honestly, from someone who hates cauliflower, you couldn't even tell it was a vegetable. 

I ordered the beer butt chicken and my boyfriend ordered the pork Milanese meaning I ate both. The pork Milanese was like a chicken fried steak except fancier and you won't hate yourself afterwards for eating an entire one. The beer but chicken was so tender and moist, with a little crisp to the skin. Yum!! I also thought it came with a potato wedge, but I attempted to cut and bite into it, only to find out it was a lemon. Lest you not make the same mistake as me.

We ended with the chocolate cake and apple crisp. Honestly, you can't go wrong with either. Both are served warm and are really yummy! Lpl

A few downfalls, parking kind of sucks, especially on a busy Friday night."}
{"text":"Somewhat by happenstance, my friend & I came here for brunch. We were being ignored next door at Bevvy (surprised because that's not like them at all)so we decided to walk over to S&S. This is beautiful and had ample fans on the patio to keep us comfortable with the 90's temps. My friend ordered the biscuits & gravy and I ordered the Chicken and Waffle. Yum! Perfectly battered juicy fried chicken and they added some cinnamon to the waffle for a sweet kick. 

$5 mimosas & bloody marys...hard to find those prices in this area of town and they didn't make the drinks weak either! 

Glad we kind of stumbled across this gem...I'm excited to go for dinner next time!"}
{"text":"I have had happy hour three times in the last month and a half.  This restaurant has the best happy hour food in the area.  It is wholesome, the right size portions and the service is best in the area.  The manager should be proud of his or her staff.  Carrie served us the last time.  She was warm and welcoming.  Plus they have a cheese cake that is to die for and you should share it because it is so rich.  I also like that they serve happy hour on the weekends--very unusual.  Try the coffee with dessert.  It is from Lux coffee company--a local coffee company."}
{"text":"Another new place at the Colony in my neighborhood.  Great decor. Love love love the music--lots of 70s Blues and R&B.  Great service.  We had the garganelli, fresh greens, frites and the steak.  Everything was fresh, tasty and well prepared.  Good wine and beer selections.  Looking forward to exploring the menu.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Fabulous !! Absolutely Delish!!! Cocktails were soooo good! My sweetie had an old fashion and I had cosmos and they were PERFECT! And we are super picky. They food was beyond great!!! The phillycheese steak egg rolls and the bread rolls with the maple bourbon butter! WOW! Our server Shelby was super sweet and took great care of us. This is our new fave spot."}
{"text":"Kung Pao cauliflower cravable and worth coming back for.  Chilly night they were busy but sat us right away and our server was good."}
{"text":"Stock and stable is a pretty fun bar. It wasn't very busy when we were there last time but it is a very nice bar inside. The drinks were very good as well. After we left, we heard there was a speakeasy upstairs so we will have to come back at some point to go and check it out!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and the food wasn't anything crazy. They DO have this amazing cinnamon bread with maple bourbon butter that was SO GOOD and that alone will get me to come back."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I originally learned about this place because I saw a cute Instagram post of their \"What else is possible...\" mural outside. However, after checking out their menu, I knew I wanted to stop-in for their food too. We went on a Saturday around 3:30pm and sat on the patio since the weather was beautiful. At that time, they were offering their dinner menu. 

Chicken wings: Absolutely fantastic! The chicken was fried to perfection but not greasy. While the menu says it's a BBQ sauce, I would consider it more of a hot sauce base since it's spicy and vinegary. You get 3 large wings... the 3 largest wings I've ever seen.

Beef pot roast: Melt in your mouth deliciousness. The mashed potatoes were also really good. The portion is very generous, I could only eat half before I was about to go into a foodcoma. 

Fried chicken sandwich: I had a bite and it was just as good as the chicken wings. Again, the chicken was fried perfectly so that it was crispy but not greasy. My BF said it was the best chicken sandwich he's ever had! The fries were also really good, I definitely stole my fair share.

This is definitely a place I would love to come back to, especially for brunch since their brunch menu looks really good. Definitely check this place out, especially if you like craft cocktails... you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time dinning at Stock & Stable after my son highly recommended it.  They have very interesting menu and we tried different items.  I liked the Cod in cippino sauce, very flavorful.  Service was also great!  The restaurant has a cute neighborhood vibe, cozy and fun."}
{"text":"We are excited about the new restaurant row in our 7th and Missouri neighborhood and watch as each new restaurant builds and opens.  We have watched the Stock and Stable build and were anticipating the opportunity to try out this new offering.  
We browsed the menu online and commented that the offerings are a very eclectic mix of smaller plates and sandwiches with 3 standard main plates.  We decided to try it out.
Starting with drinks, the bar menu is very creative and the cottontail cocktail (I tend to favor scotch) was creative and refreshing.  The addition of the Thai chili was colorful but didn't seem to add the expected hint of heat.
For starters we selected the Tongue Pastrami and the Squid Ink Cavatelli.  The pastrami was very flavorful though the meat felt to be over cooked and a bit of a paste, the Cavatelli, was rather bland.  The tongue was served with tasty homemade chips.
We ordered a brisket cheeseburger and the Cuban sandwich for our mains, both where OK, neither remarkable.
Service for the most part was perfunctory and cold, three servers helped us and with one exception did not appear to be happy or positive about their work or restaurant.
The d√©cor is a mix of period with modern touches, eclectic would be one word to describe the space, for us it matched the undefined, unfocused overall presentation.  
The restaurant was very loud, and the acoustics presented the music as just large noise in the background.
Perhaps this offering just wasn't' what we were looking for.  We shall see how this works out over time."}
{"text":"If you haven't already I highly recommend checking out this little Phoenix gem. The restaurant has a beautiful relaxed ambiance, staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. Their menu is unique and provides a variety of options. Every few months they update their menu selection keeping things new and exciting. Also make sure to make your way upstairs, the bar service and cocktail selection will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Updated Review: We went back and gave Stock and Stable another try and it was a lot better! Previously, my main issue was the lack of attentiveness of the staff. However, this time the service was excellent and the biscuits and gravy were really good. I would go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic new neighborhood restaurant! Happy they are finally open! Great atmosphere, positive vibe all the way around. Our waitress, Shannon, was FANTASTIC! Shout out to GM Corbin James for making it such a great experience!"}
{"text":"I went for Saturday Brunch. For the short review: The ambience of the outdoor patio was great! The service was awful and the food lacked flavor including their sausage gravy. I don't plan to come back. 

It took over 10 minutes to order drinks after we sat down and spoke with our waiter. We ordered our food and drinks at the same time. 20+ minutes later we got our food but still no drinks! When our drinks finally arrived I realized what a ripoff their cocktails were!  $12 for a small old-fashioned champagne glass. (And this took you half an hour to make! At 1:30 pm, your place is practically empty!)

We were very specific that we wanted the bills split between the food ordered for here vs the food to go. The waiter simply split the bills by every party member.  It took another 10 minutes to pay the bill. 

I have a friend that loves this place. If it weren't for the ripoff cocktail prices and the horrendous service, I could see going back. However, the service was so awful that I will probably recommend The Yard just up the street instead."}
{"text":"Well...just walked out because my two friends and I sat there waiting to get greeted for over 15 minutes. At least acknowledge us or something so that we know that someone is aware of our existence. Super disappointed because we had heard great things, but you can't try the great food if no one takes your order! Not giving low stars because we were actually excited. Just sucks that our table got lost in the mix and neglected."}
{"text":"Can't get enough! I  this place! It's been open a year now and the food just keeps getting better and better! I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Gonna make this review short and sweet. The amount of food you get does not match the amount of money you spend. 2 salads, one with salmon, a side of mashed potatoes and 1 beer totaled $47 before tip. 

We are not cheap people but I'm tired of these trendy restaurants popping up in central Phoenix with these petite portions. They will not get our money again."}
{"text":"Good Food and Wine. Great Down town location.:)::::::::::::------///------------////-----."}
{"text":"Just hit this spot for the first time. It hasn't been opened too long but I like to give a place a few weeks to work out the kinks. We went for brunch today, I expected it to be overly crowded since its new but it wasn't, it was busy but not crazy. Hostess was cool got us seated right away. Our waitress was nice but slow. Not slow as in speed of movement but in thought process she couldn't answer basic questions about anything and she didn't have a lot to offer us as guests in a new restaurant. Maybe it was her first server job so idk but like i said she was nice so it was whatever. The menu was a good combo of breakfast and lunch options which is what you want for brunch, hubby ordered the beef tongue hash, I ordered veggie hash, girlfriend ordered biscuits n gravy everyone enjoyed their food. The flavor on the veggie hash was really good. I enjoyed it. Oh Yea they have $5 mimosas and bloody marys so we had two rounds of these that's always great for brunch...probably got them that extra half mark to get to four stars. They have a speakeasy lounge upstairs that opens in the evening I want to try. I will definitely be back other menu items looked good and it's in my hood."}
{"text":"Have been on 3 occasions & throughly enjoyed each experience.  I'd have done 5 but Tues Aug 1st our waiter was slacking slightly. We had to find him near the back on 2 occasions folding napkins or sorting silverware, which I completely understand is essential, but perhaps not while U have a table of 6 celebrating a Bday!! Food is terrific & wine selection vast!"}
{"text":"Good job EEG!  Great food,  good drinks,  Jason and the staff took amazing care of our group!  Thank you,  def. recommend and will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The menu is not complicated or prentencious  but let me just say it is mouth watering impressive. They have found a way to take everything up a notch and every bite is a party in your mouth. The Cauliflower starter is orgasmic and the steak was stupid delicous! Their cocktail menu makes you want to try everything at least once although that may hinder you from visiting their hidden lounge upstairs (too vibrant to be named a trendy speakeasy in my opinion). Take it from a self crowned foodie who loves to travel..this place is going places!"}
{"text":"The service was fantastic; friendly and attentive but we did not feel pressured to order. The coffee was really good. I got the chicken and waffle for brunch and it was okay. My chicken was a little over cooked and dry,but I was so hungry I didn't want to send it back. I also thought it had way too much powdered sugar! I would return to try something else because I like the atmosphere and I really liked the staff!"}
{"text":"I had several business lunches here and was completely satisfied. This was my fist dinner there on a date and was not disappointed. The food was amazing, with outstanding service and a pleasant fun nonpretentious atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went to Stock and Stable for my 55th birthday tonight with my family and it was disappointing sadly nothing about the food said ..wow The soup tasteless the short ribs were overly salted to the point where we couldn't eat it then I told waiter who let me reorder chose steak which was worse the manager came over saying his apologies and said he would take care of it but the bill came fully charged with comment on it customer didn't like first meal so I can not recommend this new place and with very few people inside my opinion is not alone not the best ending to my birthday celebration"}
{"text":"So happy this little gem is in our CenPho hood!! Service is great- Gabriella behind the bar was attentive and great! The cauliflower from the shared plate section is outstanding!!! Also had he beignets which were delish! They have a generous happy hour and Monday and Tuesdays 1/2 off certain bottles of wine!! A must go to!!"}
{"text":"I must visit if you're looking for a great brunch spot! The food is fantastic and so was the service by Aaron!"}
{"text":"Swing by for an afternoon cocktail while I was in the area.  Wasn't too busy and got a spot at the bar.  Had a tasty old fashioned drink.  Bartender was friendly.  They've got a solid mix of late 90s and early 2000s music going.  If you enjoy the likes of Third Eye Blind and Oasis you will enjoy the tunes.  They have a speakeasy above this place too that I will check out at sometime.  Great spot!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Good, solid dinner.  Not all the dishes were great, but many were something we'd come back for.

I'll start with the main drawback of the night.  Busy Friday night.  It was crazy loud.  We were near-shouting the entire time.  Now on to the food.

This place is all about sharing.  We shared every dish that we ordered between the 4 of us.  Even the steaks come pre-cut for sharing purposes.  We ordered the following:

Salumi board - Probably the best dish of the night.  5 meats, 2 cheeses, Noble bread, tapenade, some pickled veggies.  It was a good size and each component was pretty darn tasty.
Pork n beans - Actually green beans cooked in pork.  It was fine.  Beans were crisp and cooking in pork added some meatiness to a veggie dish.
Farfalle - Slightly spicy in a seafood broth, this was maybe the second-best dish.  The spice saved it from general mediocrity.
Gnudi - Decent gnudi, pretty heavy on the truffle.  These little suckers are pretty filling for their size.
N.Y. Steak - A good steak for a non-steakhouse steak.  Definitely need the butter and chimichurri on the side to liven it up, but it was cooked to a good medium rare (a little closer to medium) and had decent flavor on its own.
Frites - Decent fries, nothing special.
Tuscan kale - Decent kale, nothing special.

So even with the shouting, we'd probably be back.  It's nice that parking seems easier here than across the street at the Yard."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary with style boy were we disappointed 
We chose stock and stable because we had heard good things via word of mouth.
The service was very forgettable, we sat the bar and were left alone for what seemed like forever before she acknowledged our existence.....
I ordered the cheeseburger and it was less than tasty. Very well done not to my liking. My wife ordered the Arugula salad and was please with it. 
Our drinks...... when they came ......I was again let down!
I ordered the \"some like it hot\" and it wasn't very tasty.
I was told it was a very popular drink,  maybe it's just me but I didn't care for it. 
My wife's wine was fine.... Can't mess up wine I suppose.......
All in all it was forgettable experience. I'll probably give this place one last shot , because I believe in second chances just ask my wife!"}
{"text":"The food is superb - I love their king pao cauliflower.   Their drinks are superb, but the real differentiation is the service. Corbin and all the bartenders are amazing, and because of them (and the amazing food and drink), I will be a forever customer. Thank you guys!!"}
{"text":"Wow terrible service! While asking how to separate our checks to our server he said \"you guys figure it out, I have something to do.\" He then walked away. I would never rerun here again. You shouldn't either. His name was Scotty."}
{"text":"Just OK for weekend brunch at Stock n Stable. The outdoor seating at this place was really inviting. I ordered the prosciutto benedict with a small french press coffee; my husband ordered the croque madam (french toast stuffed with pork and topped with a poached egg) and a specialty cocktail. Both our dishes and were decent tasting and relatively creative (for breakfast fare), but portions were small for the price of $11-12 for each of our dishes.  My husband downed his cocktail with glee but my french press coffee wasn't so good.  It kind of tasted like they may have re-used the press w/o fully removing the grounds from the previous use, and the coffee was only luke warm. Service was cheerful and attentive, and the restaurant appeared very clean despite it's large outdoor exposure."}
{"text":"We like the layout and atmosphere but don't care for the food. When they first opened, we had the Cubano and an omelette. The Cubano had very little amount of meat and the omelette was small. We got the burger the second time and that was good. This time we got pork chop and beer butt chicken. Both were dried..."}
{"text":"Dined here Saturday evening with my better half. Enjoyed some libations and shared a few small plates including the short rib dumplings and the Cubano sandwich. The dumplings were tasty and served fried wonton style, topped with apple compote (seemed more like applesauce) and fried leeks (yum!). They were placed atop demi and a cauliflower puree which was a tad too room temp/chilled for my liking (don't place warm food on top of chilled sauce). 

The Cubano was tasty - a great ratio of bread to meat/condiments and the bread was not too thick and was just slightly crusty on the outside and pillowy on the inside. Husband liked how much we could taste every ingredient on the sandwich and it all worked really well together. I'm thinking the pickles were house made and they added a wonderful sweet tang to the sandwich.

The atmosphere is warm, calming and inviting - a bit of old fashioned meets modern industrial charm. Darker tones, muted lights and candelight offer a perfect vibe for date night or get together with friends."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, and nice service; we had great waitress named Shannon. The wine selection was not familiar but she was helpful in explaining things  and there was a cool list of cocktails. They need really more options or at least more flexibility with their dishes. Ie: shrimp cocktail is actually a multi seafood ceviche! Huh? And you can't just order a plain shrimp cocktail. The $24 meat/cheese board cannot be sold as just a cheese board. Why not? We did not want salami and sausage. Some cocktails can only be sold as pitchers, not singles. Several time we heard \"sorry, it's pre-mixed,\" or \"sorry, the chef can't do that.\" Everything was fine, nothing amazing but fine. My companions and I said we would try it again in a month or so with the hope that they have tweaked the menu. There are too many other places that have more options, especially for vegetarians. I'd probably give it an extra half star if that was an option but it's not a 4."}
{"text":"So exited that Stock & Stable opened! I've now been a few times- and very happy to have this as a new N Cen Pho dining option.

Favorites on the menu:
- Corn Manti 
- Potted Crab
- arugula Salad
- Cauliflower
- beer butt chicken

Seriously- it's all good!

With their craft cocktails, it's a great bar scene with inventive cocktails!

Love it!"}
{"text":"I went today w/ my friend for brunch. It's a nice atmosphere and out server was great. There is absolutely nothing there if you have dietary restrictions, so I ordered a side of fruit. It was good, wish they were vegan friendly but they don't claim to be so I suppose I shouldn't expect it. I attempted to get coffee but they don't have dairy-free creamers. Both restaurants next door can accommodate to dietary restrictions so if I was really hungry, at least I had options. It was a nice atmosphere and the restaurant was really clean."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out this place, but left with little urge to come back. The food was pretty darn good (hence 3 stars) but I had some of the slowest service of my life with a half-full restaurant. No place should take close to 40 minutes to put in your order,  10 minutes to even greet me after I joined my party a little later than they got there, and a longggg time for my drink. Pretty bummed the service was not nearly as great as the food :/"}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing early bird specials. Great beer and amazing ambience. We ordered 4 apps and it was so filling. Restaurant well worth the trip."}
{"text":"YES AND MORE YES! 

I was willing to come here 3 times in one week, that should be more than enough to tell you how impressed I am with this spot. I love coming here for my lunch break. The service is impecable. Every waiter I have had has been beyond helpful, cheerful, and speedy. They automatically set a positive environment for me. Weekends there are brunch and late night is supposed to turn into a lounge with a DJ. 

I got to try an array of different food from their menu and I loved ALL of them and recommend them as well.
- Prosciutto Benedict: perfectly poached egg with abundant holidase sauce, topped with arugula, salty proscuitto, and gruyere
-Cesar Salad: light vingarette like dressing on top of smoked toasty bread with avocado
- Crispy Chicken Sandwich
I didn't get to try their pecan pie but it looked like it was to die for. 

Everything was amazing; food, service, ambiance. It had the whole package. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Jeremy and Ben, best bartenders in uptown.   Been to a few places this week and they were far and beyond the best."}
{"text":"Tried out this place on a Friday night recently.  I was impressed with the d√©cor.  They have those popular Edison style lights everywhere, very cool.  Also pretty dark but not too dark.  All the staff I encountered were also very nice.  The place was pretty packed and noisy as to be expected on a Friday night.  We sat at the bar and the service was good.  I was impressed with their craft beer selection on draft.  I guess you could call this place a gastro pub but they also specialize in mixed drinks.  I tried one and it was good.  So was the beer.  

The food, on the other had, was hit or miss.  We started with the beet salad which was amazing.  I can't recall a better one that I've had.  Then we had the pork chop and swordfish. the pork chop was $19 and did not come with any sides.  The green beans were $6 but enough for two.  The pork was cooked just right, juicy and pretty tender.  My only issues was it lacked in flavor.  Salt helped some but not enough.  It was all right but I wish it has more flavor like it had been marinated or cooked on their grill!  I ordered green beans with that which were grilled and they were great.  I just wish the grill flavor was on the pork chop too!.  The fish, on the other hand did not seem like the freshest.  It was also a little dry, overcooked.   It was not bad enough to send back but  wasn't very good.  It was also very thin so that makes it harder not to over cook it.  I wish I would have tried the Beer Butt Chicken, that looked good.  Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time as my birthday celebration spot. It did not disappoint! Making a reservation was so easy and they were able to accommodate my large party of 18 people. The server was very attentive and recommended great drinks. All the cocktails I had were so amazing! For dinner I decided to get the grilled salmon and it was delicious. The salmon was cooked to perfection and the sauce had a nice flavor, but did not overpower the fish. Overall, I loved it and will venture back some day."}
{"text":"Great service, not your average steak and potato place!  Great service, must order fire cracker cauliflower appetizer and egg roll!! To die for! Drinks good, but a little pricy! Order New York vs Ribeye  ! More flavor and tasty!"}
{"text":"My review is pretty much based on Brunch...I have also been for a cocktail (which was yum), but have only eaten at Brunch time.  Brunch was SO good.  I consider my self a brunch expert too.  The food was delicious, the coffee was served in a really unique stainless steel cup, and service was on point.  We actually sat next door at Herb Box for 15 minutes before even receiving a drink before walking to Stock and Stable.  A great spot to go with a group too.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a great place to relax, feel comfortable and enjoy a few specialty drinks  it's clean , although I didn't have the food , the menu looked and sounded amazing , a must try for next time ,"}
{"text":"Light pours, pretty good atmosphere, great waiter/fair staff, okay food (steak average when came out for 2nd time, panzenalla salad had a drop of burrita,but cauliflower app was delicious). Too much competition....nothing memorable. 3 stars at best.  Moving on."}
{"text":"Great open and hip atmosphere. Decent selection of beers on tap. Philly cheese steak egg rolls were very tasty. As was the bucatini pasta with meatballs."}
{"text":"I went to Stock and Stable with a friend just a few days after they opened. I expected them to be packed for happy hour, but we got a spot at the bar. I can't comment on the food, but the drinks we had were just alright. The hh specials include 3$ off specialty cocktails and some food specials, which is a decent deal. I got a very odd green drink that had matcha, honeydew, and wasabi... it was super weird. I didn't love it, but my friend liked it alright. To be fair, the bartender offered to make a different drink, but I didn't think it was bad enough to warrant that. My friend had a gin drink with blackberry that was much more pleasant. The drinks that look the most delicious were the cocktails that came in a pitcher... not sure how large a party you need to order a pitcher, but I would like to try the one with the chai... yum. The service was fine and the food coming out looked good. I would definitely like to come back for happy hour another day and try some other drinks and some food. I also love that they get their pastries from Lux... awesome!"}
{"text":"We came here for my friend's birthday dinner. We had a pretty big group so they had to do three different tables for us on the outdoor patio. 

I ordered the Coco Malfada. It's a short rib stroganoff. The dish was definitely different. The pasta was a black pasta. The dish was very salty. I couldn't eat even half of it. My friend's mother ordered the steak and she said her plate was also pretty salty. I guess they like their salt here. I also ordered the How bout them apples cocktail. This drink was very delicious on the other hand. 

We had two servers but the service was very slow. One of our tables got their food before we can even put in our order. I would probably come back for drinks if I'm in the area but not food."}
{"text":"I rate this a 3.7 rounded up to a 4. Came here the other night for happy hour. The pros: the drink selection as well as the wine selection was great! Another pro their happy hour menu items are very substantial compared to other restaurants. From the happy hour menu, we got the Kung pao cauliflower, fruitti de mare, salami board and also got other appetizers that weren't on hh: short rib dumplings and crab Mac n cheese. We ordered a lot thinking hh items would b super small but we were wrong!! They were huge portions! Everything was delicious!!! We had extra bread from the fruitti de mare and from the salami board which went amazing w the left over crab Mac n cheese! They should seriously add some bread to the Mac n cheese! Very good!

As my entree, I ordered the short rib since it was highly recommended w a side of brussels sprouts. This is where I was a bit disappointed hence the minus couple points. The short rib was very tender but soooo salty!! The first bite w the glaze made me cringe. Way too much salt in the glaze sauce. So after wiping the sauce from the short rib, it wasn't as salty but needless to say I was disappointed w this dish especially reading rave reviews on yelp. And the brussels sprouts were super salty too. 

So overall the atmosphere, service and all the appetizers were amazing and worth trying."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal with a wonderful friend. Stoped in Phoenix for a layover for a few hours. This place is just a few min from the airport so it was quick to get there. Had the short rib dumplings and the seafood linguini. Both were exquisite. Prices are in the upper teens so yeah a little on the high side but you get what you pay for. The ambiance is fantastic and the signature drinks are well crafted. We had the Moscow Myles and I was impressed with the cocktails as well as the food. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"YOU MUST EAT HERE. My friends and I went for restaurant week, I heard the place was good, but all expectations were exceeded! 
The drink selection is great, we started with some wine. For the first course, we got the cauliflower dish which was unbelievable, the frutti de mare, and I got the arugula salad. All were delicious - and very filling. When we finished course one I was already worried I wouldn't have room for the entree. My two friends got the beer butt chicken and I got the salmon. Both were incredible, especially the chicken. It was super juicy and the seasoning was insane. The salmon was also delicious, one of the best salmon dishes I've had. 
For dessert, we asked for a to-go container and ended up enjoying the chocolate cake at a later time. 
I believe all the items we got are on the regular (non restaurant week) menu. This place is definitely on the pricey side, but if you are willing to splurge a bit you definitely won't be sorry. The service is also excellent, and the patio is super comfy."}
{"text":"We are just bar hoping and stopped by here and Sam our bartender is great he suggested great place for us to bar hop and not many will do that.. please keep up the great work 

Thanks Sam."}
{"text":"Currently in my top 5 of favorite spots in town.  Had a chance to meet the chef a few weeks back and it was awesome to speak to him about the menu and his favorite dishes on the menu.  As for me, I am a huge fan of the fermented beets, the farfalle plate and the burger.  The decor and the layout of the place is awesome.  There were not any shortcuts taken on having this place come together the way it did.  From the food, service, lighting, decor, ambiance, and just overall feel, this is an excellent place for  a date, or a larger party.  Not to mention the speakeasy upstairs that I always find myself stopping at after the proper meal downstairs.  Phoenix is only getting better for us foodies!"}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch and dinner. 

Brunch was good, not very crowded but service was quick and food was good. 

Dinner was decent. The crab Mac and cheese was a little too fishy for my taste but everyone else loved it. The Philly cheesesteak egg rolls were excellent, the aioli puts it over the top. The corn dog appetizer was okay, good sauce options but overall nothing Id reorder. 

My husband had the filet and said it was absolutely amazing, it was flavored and cooked perfectly. The creamed corn was spicy but delicious, the corn was crisp and sweet which brought a needed burst of sweetness between the cream and spice. 

I had the salmon, cooked how the chef recommended and it was moist and flaked perfectly. The salmon and the accompaniments had no flavor even though the description boasted Asian flavors. Other people tried it and agreed they would never order it, many stating it wasn't anything they couldn't just do at home. It may have just been an off night because other people have raved about it. Maybe if it had more sauce it would have boosted the overall dish. 

The cocktail drinks are creative and delicious, I don't know if you can go wrong with any of them. 

Service was excellent but both times it was difficult finding our server to get our check."}
{"text":"First order the green beans, you're welcome. 

Only reason this got 4 stars is the open design, close tables and the lack of acoustics create a lack of intimacy. You're kind of constantly listening to other people's conversations. 

Also.....only 1 steak dish on the menu......for a place called Stock And Stable found that strange and disappointing. 

Beer chicken was to die for!  Key lime pie (fresh from LUX) was a good finisher. 

Cocktails are good but a tad on the small side for the price. All and all I would return. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stock and Stable was a new choice for me. I had the ribeye chicken fried steak. The ribeye was on the thinner side. It was placed between two rather thick pieces of Texas Toast, covered in a sausage gravy, and too with two eggs, over easy. The sausage gravy was unremarkable, not much flavor, the two pieces of Texas Toast overwhelmed the meal. Due to the thinness of the meat, iI would ask for it with one piece of Texas Toast.  The location, ambiance, and service were wonderful. Overall, it was a positive experience."}
{"text":"I am torn between giving this place 3 stars or 4.  On the one hand, I really enjoyed the appetizers and dessert.  On the other hand, I did not enjoy my entree.

For appetizers, I got to try a little bit of a lot of them.  The hummus was great and I enjoyed the vegetables that accompanied the hummus.  There was the normal carrot and cucumber, but there were also some unusual vegetables tossed in there (like something that resembled a white carrot? and a purple carrot?)

The shisito roasted peppers were tasty, but 1 pepper was enough for me and it came with probably 15 in the appetizer so definitely make sure you have a large group to share those with.

The kung pao cauliflower was I think my favorite appetizer.  I would have liked for the cauliflower to be crispier, but it was still really tasty.  

The philly steak egg rolls were alright, just tasted like meat inside of an egg roll wrapper.  It came with a cheesy sauce to dip that I didn't try.

For my entree I wanted to get shortribs, but since I can't eat dairy I wanted to substitute the side of mashed potatoes it came with for something that didn't have dairy.  The waiter told me that the \"chef respectfully declines to allow substitutions\".  He told me that they could leave the mashed potatoes off my plate and I could pay to order a different side if I wanted.... wow, what a great deal /sarcasm.  If they can leave the potatoes off and add a different side... why couldn't they just do that without charging me $6 more?!

Anyway, so I didn't get the short ribs and ordered the cod.  I liked the little clams that came with it and the crusty bread.  The red tomato sauce was entirely too salty.  I only ate a few bites of it.

The other entrees didn't look that impressive either.  My boyfriend said his burger and fries was only \"okay.\"  If I came back I would probably load up on appetizers as my meal and skip the entrees altogether."}
{"text":"THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR BDAY CELEBRATIONS. I was looking forward to dining at Stock & Stable for my birthday. From the outside it looks cute and location is nice (central Phoenix). I have kidney issues which means, I rarely (if ever) eat steak. So I figured for my birthday dinner I will order the NY Steak. 1- it is a tiny portion 2- it was over priced for the portion and the fact that it comes with no sides. Food overall was just overpriced and small portion. In addition, my guests went to \"the restroom\" aka to ask the waitress if they give bday cake or ice cream for the guests (usually it's complimentary).. they said no. There was just no accommodations for for a special occasion. So, as much as it's cute on the outside... not going to be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent flavor. Took my family for our thanksgiving dinner and we were all very impressed:)  the restaurant is very nice and has a good ambiance and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I live down the street and have been curios to try this place for a while. Took my parents and mother in law there tonight. Great food and excellent service by our waitress Shelby. My mom said best waitress she's ever had. We got the short-rib entree, cubano sandwich, kung pao cauliflower, brussel sprouts, the chicken wings, the panzanella salad and the arugula salad. Everything was awesome although I didn't think the brussels were anything to write home about (the sauce was weak, not a lot of flavor). Definitely would recommend the Cubano."}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's Day night. Ordered the salmon and it was superb!!! Had Aaron as a waiter and while the kitchen didn't want to make additional changes to a dish ordered, Aaron came off short and cut off the person I was with as she tried to explain what she wanted. However, after the bill came Aaron came back and apologized for how he came off and made sure to rectify the situation 100%!!! I would definitely come back to this restaurant again and recommend it to friends!!! The food I had (minus the super dry pork chop the person I was with had) was amazing!!! Overall, definitely a place to put on your list to try!!!"}
{"text":"We went with a party of 4 last night to this new place in Central Phoenix. I heard great things about it so I wanted to check it out. The place is really loud. If you are planning to talk in this restaurant, it is very hard to hear. We ordered the beet salad which was great. And then ordered the cauliflower which was ok. I thought it would be better. The male server with stubble on his face was non personable at all. I noticed other wait staff being extra friendly and outgoing.He didn't really go over the menu, explain the concept or give any suggestions. I asked about a non sweet vodka drink and he showed me a drink that had Gin. I asked if he could swap Gin with Vodka and he said no. He said they have a full bar, which I could obviously see. But, wanted to try one of their signature cocktails. I ordered the pork chop which was good. Another person ordered the steak which was ok, a bit fatty. Overall it was ok. Would I come back? Not sure."}
{"text":"I love the patio dining area of this restaurant.  The soft colors of the cushioned benches and tables really bring forth the summer vibes to this space. It's so nice here Arizona that I find myself always asking for outdoor seating when I'm here. The main dining area is absolutely stunning. It's spacious and warm. Now, let's get to the food. I was lucky to try some of their new dishes recently. Please refer to my photos. All dishes were delightful and well seasoned. Their cocktails were exquisite to look at and enticing to the taste buds. For appetizers, I highly recommend the Kung Pao Cauliflower and the Philadelphia Cheesesteak Egg Rolls. I loved the Yellowtail as my main dish, while hubby adored the Beer Butt Chicken. It's a win win no matter what. This is a pretty casual cool date night spot for sure. If you haven't been here, I highly suggest you add it to your to do list. Until the next review, stay hungry everyone!!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday last night with a party of 8... Great food & drinks, good service, killer music and ambiance. We all had a great time! Nice addition to CenPho!!"}
{"text":"When you walk into a hip, trendy and new restaurant you automatically discount that the food is going to be as good as the overall ambiance....not in this case! Stock & Stable crushed in all categories! First, you have to get one of their fantastic cocktails. Yes, they've got cool sound names, but the bartender backs it up with a solid concoction! Next, the appetizers tasted great and were not the same old same old. Definitely try the unique Philly cheese steak egg roll especially if you are eating with someone from Philly! The Brussel Sprouts are the it vegetable right now and these did not disappoint while I still thought I was eating something healthy. The beet appetizer was on point! Very original and extremely tasty. Side note a few people in our party thought a few of the dishes were salty. Next we got a nice bottle of red wine to go with our dinner. The fish special was phenomenal; the red broth was delicious and they use Noble bread which is a huge plus. Other people in our party got some other dishes which quiet honestly I don't recall as I was really into my food (and alcohol). Decided to skip desert and head upstairs to a lounge, yes a lounge in Cenpho! Definitely give Stock & Stable a try well worth the reasonable prices for high quality."}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I came back to Stock & Stable and were extremely happy with our choice.  Cocktails were some of the best we had.  We had a couple appetizers the Kung Pao Cauliflower  and pork belly steamed rolls. WOW!! These were both some of the best things we've ever put in our mouth.

We shared the special (fried chicken dinner) and it was better than any fried chicken we've ever had.  We used to visit the south frequently and have never had fried chicken this good.  After dinner we went up stairs to Honor Amongst Thieves.  The music and vibe was the best in the city.  Remind you, it is June and the place still had the energy you would expect in the non summer months.

Looking forward to going back to both of these spots!"}
