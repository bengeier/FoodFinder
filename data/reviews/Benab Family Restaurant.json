{"text":"Ordered Dinner for 3(A), Curry goat with rice, jerk pork for 5 adults one child to share with lots of left overs. Curry goat and jerk pork were great. I would definitely go back for those two dishes alone. As mentioned in previous comments, there is a lot of seating but I wouldn't want to bring the whole family for a sit down dinner there. Next time I'll call ahead and pick up"}
{"text":"Great mixture of Chinese and Guyanese food at affordable prices. Didn't like the the clientele, seems to cater to the local 'hood' of the area, but aside from that, the food was very tasty. Roti was top notch and we enjoyed the curried beef. Meat was very soft and had the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"I know all the Pepole that cook there the food is really you got to get the good kind off food. Choy the worker he gives me free pop one guy have me lots of candy an chocolate I Love it"}
{"text":"Oh wow, another fantastic Chinese Caribbean place in this neighbourhood.  I tried the jerk pork fried rice along with mixed vegetables with shrimp and both dishes were huge in terms of portions.  The jerk pork wasn't the best I've tasted but it was fine and along with the fried rice, it made for a great dish.  The vegetables in the shrimp dish were very fresh as was the shrimp which were nicely succulent.    I took heed of some of the other reviews that it can be rowdy in there as there are many locals who enjoy the bar.  And the first thing I noticed was the stench of alcohol when I walked in in addition to the loud shouting from some of the people at the bar.  But they didn't give me any trouble at all.  So based on my experience, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm frequently at this plaza to dine at one it's numerous quality restaurants - be it Queen City, Border MX, or Soon Tofu. One restaurant that I had never been to at that plaza until recently was Benab. However, I was recently told by a friend that he stops by Benab to satisfy his Guyanese-Chinese cravings whenever he's in Mississauga. With that level of recommendation, I had to try them out.  I had always noticed a handful of people, who I presumed to be regulars, gathered outside Benab's entrance in the late evenings. That may have been one of the factors as to why I had never given them a visit before - simply because it felt like I had to go through a group of people just to get in. However, one night, when I was meaning to go to Queen City and just realized that their hours had changed, I was left with Benab as the only option available. A friend and I decided to sit down and have our first crack at Guyanese-Chinese food.  Upon entering, the inside is much like the outside - groups of people just chilling at the bar, drinking and socializing. However, around the corner was a much emptier and quieter dining room, which was much nicer than I had anticipated. We checked out the menu and were excited to see the diverse range of Guyanese-Chinese cuisine. Jerk pork chow mein!? Yes please.   We ended up ordering a jerk pork chow mein ($7.50) and a bhoongal chicken ($10.50). Check out those prices! These aren't puny portions either - these were monster plates. For the late night snack we were looking for, the jerk pork chow mein alone would more than suffice (at $3.75 each!!!).   The jerk pork chow mein came in a mountain of noodles covered in thinly sliced jerk pork. The jerk pork wasn't the best jerk pork I've had (Portland Jerk in Brampton gets that distinction), but I was more than satisfied with the quality for the price.   Having ordered a safe dish already, we wanted to try something we've never tried before in the bhoonjal chicken. Bhoonjal basically means that the curry is cooked down until there is no sauce and the curry flavour just clings to the chicken. Interesting. It definitely looked and tasted like nothing I've had before - the remains of the curry paste were really thick. However, I enjoyed the dish and would order it again.  The service was good considering the amount of patrons at the bar and the time of day.  I was pleasantly surprised with Benab and had to relay my satisfaction to my friend. Will definitely have to make many return visits to try more of their offerings. With Benab being the restaurant in that plaza open the latest now, I'm sure there will be plenty of opportunities."}
{"text":"I went here based on a recommendation from my girlfriends father.  Walked in with some friends only to get some oddly dirty looks from the regulars at the bar.  Had a beer and the jerk pork & chicken fried rice.  Food was spicy and absolutely delicious.  Got the bill and it came out to under $20 for two people.  They could easily charge $2-$3 more per plate without complaints.  Now I try to make it here once a week!"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be called Sijan, however they've changed their location and are trying to make this place more \"family oriented\" with lots of seating. However, If I had children, I still wouldn't bring them here. I usually get harassed by one of the many drunk men standing outside the front door or sitting by the Bar. Take my advice, call ahead and order for take out! But obviously what's stands out is the yummy Food! It's excellent! It's Chinese food with Caribbean infusion! My favs are the jerk pork, jerk pork rice, jerk chicken, roasted chicken and their wings. Their noodles are pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"So we finally get to try the food here after passing by so many times to go to restaurants next door. And we actually loved the food :))) The best west Indian- Chinese food we ever tasted so far. \"Wok Hei \"!!! We had a happy meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be called Sijans but now its called Benab chinese-guyanese restaurant. The new location here is better then what it was before when it was Sijans but it is still somewhat ghetto.    The only thing is that the food here is great and they give you a hugeee portion for what you are paying. In the front they have their regulars who are come in sit at the bar and just drink the day away. In the back of the restaurant they have lots of seating and is more family appropiate as in there are no drunk ppl hassaling you or bothering you. They have some pretty good chinese and guyanese food here. Why im giving it 4 stars is because the staff here is nice , they are trying to change it into a more family oriented environment and the food here just overpasses all that, its cheap and tasty."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE!!!! The drunks are always there and plenty of illegal activity happening. Yes great food but not a family restaurant due to the drunk regulars. I don't recommend it due to the regulars. Sadly they have contributed to their bad reputation."}
