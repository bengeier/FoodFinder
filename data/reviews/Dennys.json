{"text":"I've traveled a lot and lived in various places around the country.  Denny's is somewhere between a guilty pleasure and last resort.  Generally they're consistent from state to state and city to city.  I've had carry-out orders a few times from this location and every time there's been an issue such as missing items, instructions not followed, or the order missing altogether.  Each time I'm optimistic it will be better next time... and it's not."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! First of all when you walk in there is no hostess for about five minutes. Got to the table and it was sticky, menus were dirty, seat had lettuce on it and the floor was filthy. It was whatever because we were hungry. We ordered and when I got my grilled chicken sandwich it was raw. yes raw. Half was cooked while the other side was as pink as a new born baby. I immediately made them take it back for a new one which they did and fixed it. I bit into it and It was just nasty. It tasted like i made it myself with left over ingredients. Stick to their breakfast food! Our server was wonderful and it wasn't his fault our food was nasty so we didn't tip him bad. But the place was filthy. Not going to that one anymore, stick to the one by West towne."}
{"text":"always great food with great service.  Nothing too fancy but fills you up and gets you on the way."}
{"text":"I've been to this Denny's a few times, food was always hot and tasty. Nothing fancy, prices were consistent with other locations for breakfast. Service has always been pretty acceptable. If you need a quick bite stop here, also they have free wifi!"}
{"text":"Went to Denny's this morning for breakfast with my twins and fiance. We walked in the door and their was no hostess which is understandable if they are busy but they really weren't. We had at least five servers look dead at us as well as cooks and stood there for a good five minutes and still no one said anything to us so we walked out and went to the McDonald's across the street."}
{"text":"I got moldy fruit! The round hispanic waitress didn't even apologize! I left her a big fat zero tip. I guess thats what I get for going to a Dennys in the middle of asscrack nowhere"}
{"text":"Interesting healthy and affordable menu. I had the chili and salad. Service great. Who knew?"}
