{"text":"Best Philly cheesesteaks in Las Vegas hands down won't go anywhere else and I've been to tons of different spots nothing taste as good"}
{"text":"Listen! I grew up in South Jersey with the Philly skyline view from my back porch! Heard about this place! Watching the Eagles play Dallas... down 9-7 @ halftime... 3rd quarter... food arrives... one bite!!! Felt like home!!!! Only cheese steak I have Ever endorsed as a Philly Cheese Steak!!!! Then.... Eagles go 30-0 second half!!!! Just ordered them again!!!!"}
{"text":"the service was great, staff is awesome.
the food, it was ight nothing out of this world."}
{"text":"Been here several times now food has been great some people are new and need a little bit more training but otherwise the place is great food is excellent definitely would come back I prefer this to pops.
Mark the owner was very friendly on our very first visit giving out free drinks and made it very welcoming for us."}
{"text":"This place is my new go-to place for lunch, great food fast service, convenient drive through, couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Gotta say.. Place might actually beat out POPs for best Cheesesteak I have had since moving from PA.. Deff has an authentic feel to it.. Even down to knowing what a Whiz wit is.. Will deff be coming back.. Only thing right now POPs has over it is the Birch Beer and tastykakes.. Now if only I could find Yuengling.. I would be set."}
{"text":"Worst $11 I have ever spent ..  the philly chicken was so soggy & messy I couldn't pick it up to eat & the chicken was disgusting tasted like it was from a can. The whole experience was just not a good one. I never write reviews, but I was so upset.."}
{"text":"Good bread, excellent meat, perfect proportions of add-ons, fantastic flavor. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time and I'm convinced there is no better philly cheese steaks in Nevada period!! 
Very clean, fast, and organized. Don't sleep on this place!"}
{"text":"Best philly in town 
Got to try that #3 American chesesteak with grilled onion & salt and pepper & some cherry peppers bomb.com
Open till 12am even better"}
{"text":"Bought two philly's drove off to see they had forgot the other sandwich, went back and got it ... then drove all the way home to eat only to find not one but two hairs in my food.
I'm sure they do everything they can to prevent this from happening but it's absolutely gross to find hair in your food.
Don't think I'll be coming back to this spot, sad because I like a good philly."}
{"text":"Food was fast, hot and yummy! William was so nice and Rick was a great cook. Good job guys! The hubby and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Wowwww is all I have to say. Can't believe this place is back and it hasn't changed a bit and that's a good thing. The Philly cheesteaks tastes exactly as they did then they were at thier old location. The place is technically new so wasn't busy at the time I visited so the service was good and food came out very good and hot. I ordered a provolone cheesteak and chili cheese fries. Both were very good. I would highly recommend and forsure will be back!!"}
{"text":"Have this place a try for a cheese steak and would highly recommend.   Wife got steak and I got the chicken cheese steak sandwich and both were really good.   The fries were hot and crispy.  We will be back when we get another craving."}
{"text":"I am not a cheesesteak expert but this sandwich was delicious!  I had the mushroom cheesesteak with provolone and wiz.  The bread was soft and delicious, there was a good portion of meat and mushrooms. I also had the chili cheese fries, they were good but the sandwich was large enough to have eaten alone.  I will be back for more very soon. I will try the meatball sub IF the meatballs are homemade.

Went back today for lunch and had the Chicken Parm sandwich, not as good as their cheesesteak. I wanted to try the meatball sub but the meatballs are not homemade. Still give five stars for the cheesesteak sandwich."}
{"text":"Wow! Had the steak and provolone and it was excellent. Saw this place was coming and was excited, they did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Workers were very friendly. 

A few things to work on ( but not worth taking off a star )
1) workers need to get in tune with each other, they will get there... still seem new. 
2) dine in representation not the best. I suggest large paper boats. 
3) set up for drinks.. need a table near the drinks for straws, lids and napkins
4) music could be a little more... let's just say span all generations 

By the way the food and the employees were awesome!"}
{"text":"I had a Philly cheese steak and it was yummy. The sandwich was a nice size for the price and the customer service was awesome. I would definitely go back when I'm on that side of town. I've never had a Philly cheese steak from Philly so I can't compare but it was delicious."}
{"text":"I hate to rate this place for the service but my experience was horrible. Waited in the drive-thru for 45 minutes! Yes, that's right 45 minutes with only two cars ahead of me. I even called the store to see what the hold up was and their only response was, \"we're busy\" and to only find out there was only a couple of people inside the store. When I finally pulled up to the window, the lady greeted me with my total and nothing else. Not a hello, apology for the long wait, just my total. After I got my food and paid I didn't get a thank you either. Place is a joke, I'm not going back. Bring back Hot Dog on a Stick!"}
{"text":"Food is great been eating at steakout for many years best cheese steak in town by far"}
{"text":"Really hit and miss. Sometimes it's awesome, sometimes not. It's that inconsistency that is gonna stop me from going. Just went through the drive thru, cheesesteak was thrown together, fell apart when I opened it, and THEY FORGOT THE CHEESE! I called them when I got home and they assured me they put cheese on it. Guess my eyes aren't working! What ever happened to the customer is always right? Especially when I'm staring at the freaking sandwich while they're telling me they put cheese in it! Still looking for THAT cheesesteak spot!"}
{"text":"This place needs to figure out how to run a safe and efficient food business. I went on to pick up two cheesesteaks for takeout and waited close to 35 minutes. There were two people working - no other customers. The one at the register kept going back to help the cook - neither was wearing gloves when handling the food directly. When we opened the sandwiches at home, the beef and chicken looked like jerky. A 35 minute cook time will probably do it. What a waste of money. Go down the street for Capriotti's if you want a good sandwich."}
{"text":"The food is real good but the price is what isn't.. For 1 person it is over $15 for a lunch.  Just seems a little excessive"}
{"text":"I hope it's good... we have been in the drive thru for 40 mins.... there was only a single car in front of me and I ordered a single philly."}
{"text":"Amazing service and extremely delicious food. I got the pepper cheesesteak and the sweet and savory combination of flavors were to die for. Mike the cashier was extremely friendly and helpful and even came out to the front to offer to get us refills on our drinks even though we didn't ask. I will definitely be here plenty more times after today."}
{"text":"The 5 stars are for the fries and ranch.. I wish they would sale the ranch in bottles lol. I got the provolone cheese steak and it was pretty good it wasn't the best I've ever had but I would probably like the chicken philly better.. I would definitely recommend this place and I'll be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Best Philly Cheese Steaks in town.  Friendly and courteous staff.  You've got to try this place."}
{"text":"Yummmm just like home. This is the first take out so far since I've moved out here that I actually LOVE. I will be coming back"}
{"text":"Straight out of Philly. It all starts with the bread. Their bread? Straight out of philly, Amoroso rolls.  To you people who know, the bread makes the sandwich. This place is legitimate.  Awesome me steaks! Plenty of meat.  Cheese wiz if you prefer.  Stop by and help this place get past a possible tough location. THE FOOD IS GREAT!!!!"}
{"text":"One word...Amoroso's!!!!!!!!

Yelp is making me write more but wanted to drop the mic after Amoroso's...if you've ever lived in the Philly area you know what I'm talking about, they ship them in and taste as fresh as back home. The meat is great too, and they have cherry peppers. Haven't tried the hoagie yet but cheesesteak is legit!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to take my son and I to Pops for a cheese steak when I came across this place and decided to try it. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The cheese steak and my sons pizza steak were tasty but were very skimpy on the cheese. I mean what is a cheese steak without a healthy amount of cheese, provolone not cheese wiz. I had the special which comes with mushrooms, grilled onions, and peppers. These too were a little light. I would have preferred more onions and mushrooms. They also do not offer any military or other discounts. Next time I take my son to try a cheese steak I'll have him try Pops and get his comparative."}
{"text":"The 1st time I went I was pleasantly surprised.   The sandwich was hot and full and delicious.   Just like a Philly steak.  I talked so much about it that I convinced my dad (who moved here from Philly a month ago) to try one.  To say that we were both disappointed is to say the  least.  By the time I got back home it was cold and there was not a lot of meat for a $9 sandwich.  The next time I go I will let them know so that they can fix that problem.  I really want to give them another chance.  Not a lot I'd places to get a good Philly sandwich.  I'm rooting for you guys"}
{"text":"I grew up going to Eagle games and eating cheese steaks.  Stopped in today with my son and had 1 with provolone and 1 with whiz.  We both enjoyed our cheese steaks and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Cheesesteaks, cold sandwiches, and fries- simple but tasty menu, complete with a drive thru. Get your sandwich with american, provolone, or whiz, and add on onions. If you're really feeling dangerous, they also have pizza fries. Everything is made fresh and fast at this family-owned business.

EDIT: Dropping a star. I don't come by regularly but the second and third experiences were drastically different from the first. Food's still good but service leaves something to be desired, which is surprising considering they have sign spinners out to drive in more business."}
{"text":"The original! I grew up in Philly eating cheesesteaks and soft pretzels and missed them dearly when I moved to Vegas. I remember coming here 15 years ago, when they were on Decatur/Alta. They put plenty of meat on the sandwich and I always make sure to get extra whiz. Prices are reasonable and well worth it, especially considering this is the best cheesesteak in town IMO"}
{"text":"If the food doesn't win you over the excellent service will. Definitely a hidden gem in Las Vegas. I implore all fans of cheesesteak whether it be with cheese whiz or provolone to look no further and come to Straight From Philly."}
{"text":"The cheesesteaks where out of this world. The cheese fries and the pizza fries were awesome too. Friendly staff and most definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"Pretty good tasting sandwich. The size was a bit smaller than I would have liked."}
{"text":"When it comes to legitimate cheesesteak here in town we all pretty much head to Pops. I remember Straight From Philly Steakout from back in the day (used to be where Pops is now) and after eating here recently I remembered why they faded from the spotlight years ago. This place would draw long lines and people raved about the cheesesteak and then the quality started to decline and the lines did too. Not sure they will ever capture the attention they once did especially with Pops nearby. I used the drive thru and the girl who took my order wasn't friendly at all. She made me feel like I was bothering her by ordering a sandwich. When I first unwrapped the pastrami sandwich it looked so good there was a good amount of meat filled nicely inside the bread. The pastrami was a disappointment with very little flavor and the meat  was thin and gristly. If you base your pastrami on places known for it like The Hat (cali) or The Hut (AZ) the pastrami here will definitely not be up to your standards. The cheesesteak I had was so bad. Seriously the meat was flavorless and the grease was everywhere and it was a complete waste of money. The owner doesn't take feedback well here on yelp and instead just wants to believe their way is the right way. It to me tasted like they bought a case of Steak-umms from Sam's Club and threw it on the grill. I am shocked to see the way they respond to some of the yelp reviews on here. It's like Rambo's Kitchen rants all over again lol. I'd rather give my hard earned money to Pops where I have never been treated so badly for just ordering a sandwich and where the food is worth the money because I personally did not find that here."}
{"text":"It really is straight out of Philly and it's good love the cheese wiz. Eat there you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Delicious and quick/helpful service. The drive thru is very convenient. The peppers are a bit on the super hot side."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place after a class one time and thought I would give it a try. I had a typical Philly cheese steak with the fixings and the best part was the cheese wiz sauce. I asked why they use cheese wiz and they said that's how it's done in Philly, so I said Hook it up. The sandwich was very good , the owner was in there and I can see that he took great pride in his establishment and to me it reflects in the food.  Would I come here again , of course. If you are in the area try it out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with small chairs. Good affordable food on the go, I was visiting Nevada with my family and we saw multiple people quickly get food to go."}
{"text":"This is trully a philly cheese steak place. Las Vegas has a tendency to have restaurants that always say genuine but always have horrible food & somehow still stay in business for years. This is not one of those places. Every time I eat here it takes me back to Pennsylvania. I have to control myself from only going here weekly. I have tried many places including one near this one & none of them are even close to the quality that this place has. I will never eat a cheese steak anywhere else unless I visit family in PA again."}
{"text":"Saw the Ad on  FB decided to check in out being that my husband and I are originally from back east. It's wasn't bad but the flavor wasnt anything you can grab on to with nostalgia. It was just a cheese steak sandwich nothing more nothing less. Tastes good but so does the Capriottis cheese steak but the difference is Capriottis costs less. We had the cheez  wiz and it didn't pack a punch of flavor, I knew it was in there but just didn't taste it. Everything is al la carte so if you want fries its additional (no biggie) drink also additional again no biggie however....to add tomato, lettuce or mushrooms $1 extra per item. Again I'll pay for extras but lettuce? Tomato? Come on thats just silly to nickel and dime for 2-3 slices of tomato. Two steak sandwiches, two orders of fries, two drinks and an order or mozzarella sticks $42. I appreciated the young man who gave us our food from the drive through remembering he forgot to add tomatoes to my sandwich before I drove off, and gave me a container with some later to add however when We parked and I unwrapped my sandwich to dig in I noticed they also forgot my mayo and ketchup I requested on my sandwich (bummer) I checked the bag where the fries were...also no ketchup packets.  We came, we saw and we conquered...we won't rush back. Again not because it nasty it just was mediocre. No wow factor and a bit pricey for average taste."}
{"text":"I went to the one on Charleston and it was amazing. I really enjoyed the steak sandwich and fries. I love that you added hot peppers on the side to give it that extra spiciness. I was not disappointed at all. The reviews said it was the best in Vegas and I can agree with that as well. Loved my food and I will be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"This place is great!
The guys that work here are so nice.  Hands down best Philly cheesesteak in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I tried a chicken philly with green peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions & provolone cheese & added mayo. It was very good. It was flavorful & had the right balance of meat and veggies. The people were friendly & sandwich was cooked to order & fresh. I will go back next time & try it with the cheez whiz. The place is small with only 3 or 4 tables so a carryout is recommended."}
{"text":"Great Philly cheesesteak. Best I've had since returning to Las Vegas from Pennsylvania. Fresh roll, meat tasty and not a bit of fat. Service is wonderful! The owners are super nice and friendly. I'll be back again and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The delivery was quick and bread  so fresh. Could have used a bit more seasoning, provolone philly sandwich wasn't seasoned enough.
I'll try them again just maybe try something different."}
{"text":"First time visit and glad I went! Staff were friendly and efficient. Had the American cheesesteak and an order of fries which were really really good! Sandwhich was large and perfect to split with my friend. Can't wait to try other items on their full menu. Place is tucked in a small shopping center but worth finding."}
{"text":"I thought I would give this place a try . I was very satisfied it's hard to find a good philly in Vegas . I'll be going back"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after taking my dog to the wonderful vet across the street. Good food, good price, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The first time I went in I was not too impressed.  But I gave them another try. And the subs just seem to get better and better.  They do take a few minutes to make so call ahead.  Tasty steak and cheese !!"}
{"text":"Salt lick sandwich w/ a smidge of mystery wiz.... my order was  completely wrong and I'll stick w/ POPS for eve! this is garbage compared to the real shit!!!!!!!!!!!! To add insult to injury, I was blamed for the misunderstanding because I used grub hub. Talking about I need to call them? I guess the restaurant doesn't make the food? ??? what a fool I am!!!!! SMH TRASH"}
{"text":"Pete has awesome food and great service best in town. I wouldn't go anywhere else for a cheese steak."}
{"text":"Ordered the Philly Steak Special.  Bun was soft but the meat tasted like chuck and did not have enough salt."}
{"text":"Meh. I got the chicken cheese steak with peppers and onions and was pretty disappointed. It's barely seasoned at all (I don't think I've ever had to ADD salt to my fast food) and the amount of cheese on my fries was sad. I only live a couple blocks away, but the sandwich was soggy AF by the time I got home. I can't believe I paid $14 for this -_-"}
{"text":"VERY impressed!!!!  The rolls were amazing, soft with a perfect toast!  The meat was cooked perfect with just the right amount of grease and the cheese wiz was so good!  They are very generous with their meat and cheese!  Enjoy!  Best philly cheese stakes in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Best in town!! Best in the whole west!!

This place is awesome!! Awesome food!!!
Awesome people!! 
When I was a child my grandfather use to take me to a place in Philly that made the best Hodge sandwiches and cheesesteaks. I have never been able to find any place that's close to those sandwiches.... until now!!! 
My husband and I split a Italian and cheesesteak. They were exactly what I've been looking for. Perfection!! Best sandwiches ever!! New favorite place to eat!!
Of the two sandwiches, I'm partial to the Italian!! But I'd recommend either!!"}
{"text":"My brother in law treated us to a Philly Cheese Steak here for lunch. The Cheesesteaks are about as authentic as you can get. Very good, served quick and hot. This is a must go spot for lunch"}
{"text":"Scott, Kenny, and Andrew took great care of us and the sandwiches are delicious - exactly what you hope for at a cheesesteak place. Will go again!"}
{"text":"A very enthusiastic staff helped me pick the perfect sandwich to quell my hunger.  It was a classic Philly cheese steak with cheese wiz. Great bread.  The parm fries were on point add well.   I've never been to Philadelphia but it felt legit."}
{"text":"First time here. I like the staff. Very friendly. Helpful. Service is 5 stars. 
As for food. You won't be coming in for the fries or cheese sticks. They were ok. But the philly steak sandwiches  were AWESOME!!!!! I had the loaded #9. Stacy had the #4 with provolone. 
OMG. THEY WERE FRESH. hot and tasted like heaven. We will hitting them at least once a week. 
Oh. And they have a drive thru so call ahead and pick up at drive thru."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a Philly cheesesteak that has just the right amount of steak and cheese on a roll, this is the wrong place. The sandwich I had was skimpy on meat and cheese, mostly was bread. Huge disappointment, I suggest staying away from here and going somewhere else."}
{"text":"First time here. Service was great. Friendly and fast. Unfortunately, the Philly #9 was sub par. I got mine with provolone but there was barely any there so it was a little dry. I'm originally from Pennsylvania and have been eating cheese steaks since I was a kid. It would be ok with little cheese as long as the meat was very moist but it wasn't. Which is also understandable since its just a drive thru fast food but these things need to be considered in order to compensate for a good finished product. Reading other reviews, I see that some days are good and some not which leads me to believe the meat is not fresh every day. You would have to catch them on a fresh day or a cheese generous day. I got neither. :( bummer because I live close by and would like to have a local place that's consistent."}
{"text":"This place is awesome... Simple menu and quality food at a reasonable price. The guys are friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. We were super happy to have a cheesesteak place around the corner from us. Cheesesteaks were a little greasy but that's the good part. Fries also needed to be cooked a little longer and seasoned better but I'll still be back to try to the chicken cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this place. We got the #9 And Cheese Wiz Fries. The meat was cooked to perfection, great flavors and very good ratio of meat to bread. Service was amazing, super friendly!"}
{"text":"The food was above adverage.  Good amount if meat and good bread.  Nice to have the cheese wiz option more of a back east flare.  They will give you a refill on your drink if you ask.  Friendly staff  worth a try"}
{"text":"I was craving a cheese steak and looked at yelp for somewhere near Henderson to score one. I had forgotten this place had opened and decided it was worth a try. The gentleman at the drive-thru was friendly he took my order and they prepared it quickly. I ordered a pepper steak with wiz and some fries and took it home. One bite and I knew it was worth the trip. My sandwich was delicious and hit the spot. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Never again! Customer service sucks! 
Maybe the guy taking our order should listen to what we're ordering instead of trying to multi task. Because when we got our food we obviously had an order of fries missing! So then I had to get up and go order another order of fries! About $50 for sandwiches, fries and drinks for 4 people and we can't even get our food we order. Oh and why is it that there are way more veggies than meat in my philly???? This place is awful. Sticking to Pop's, at least they listen! Geezuz! My daughter couldn't even treat me out to simple meal without me getting pissed off!"}
{"text":"Thankfully there is at least on Philly joint in town that still cares about making a proper cheesesteak. They go to the trouble or ordering Amoroso bread all the way from Philly, they are very friendly AND they have a drive through. I picked up a huge order of steaks to watch the Super Bowl and they were magical enough that the Birds won the game. 

Fly Eagles Fly!

This joint is awesome."}
{"text":"Oh man this place was awesome!

Saw the Yelp reviews, was jonesin' for a Philly cheesesteak, so naturally I made the trek over here. Daaayyuuuum was this place good! 

I ordered the Philly cheesesteak w/ onions & cheese wiz, wife got the same except added mushrooms. Meat was melt in your moth tender. Plenty of cheese wiz (which is critical) and the onions was diced small which I liked, so they weren't crunchy at all. Got an order of fries with it. Seriously the food was out in like 3 minutes. 

Clearly a family owned business as two ladies were sitting near us and going in and out of the back area. One was super kind and brought over a bag of Famous Amos cookies for my son. The entire staff was super friendly and asked us a few times how we liked our food. When I said it was my first time they of course followed up with an \"I hope you'll be back.\"

To quote the Terminator...\"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"Ok so I have to own up, I made my first food review mistake  I accidentally reviewed straight from philly. The wrong place. This is straight from philly steakout and this is the real deal. Very cool experience with the owners and camera person that was there. Had a fun interview! The food here is delicious! New favorite philly place in town. Hanks will forever have a special place in my heart, but it's been gone for years. Just like hanks did, these guys import their bread from philly and it makes a big difference. Making yummy noises the whole time. They even have a drive thru! So my sincere apologies. Straight from philly is good, but straight from philly steakout is the best! I also challenge anyone who thinks Pop's is the best in town to try here."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money! Greasy with no flavor. I got through half of my cheese steak before the bread fell apart. The onions were barely sauteed and not cut properly at all. I love a good cheese steak but this place missed the mark completely."}
{"text":"I was spoiled by one place in LA that served what I thought was the best cheesesteak west of Philly.  The bread was perfect and the meat, cheese and mushrooms blended together into utter perfection.

Now I deliver for grub hub and I am in and out of restaurants all day.  I've begun to get a lot of orders fromStraight from Philly and decided I'd better give them a try myself.  

I was not disappointed.  The taste was great.  I would have liked a slightly crustier bread but it was very good.  The guys who work there are also friendly and accommodating.

There are a lot of cheesesteak places to try but this is now my go to place."}
{"text":"Truly delicious food! If you want a quality Philly sandwich. The staff is extremely friendly and energetic, service is fast, and the food's quality and quantity exceeds your expectations for the price point!

You won't get an imitation here! Yum!"}
{"text":"Straight Outta Philly is right. East coast native here. This place has the right ingredients which makes a Philly Cheesesteak what it is. Have tried most places out here and this does not dissapoint. The only disappointment would be that you want more. Thinking about whether or not to eat seconds is usually the case. Come by and five it a try."}
{"text":"If you Love east coast real Philly's then this is probably one of the best in Vegas/Henderson.  I'd go back.   4 stars based on what it is in that category."}
{"text":"Great place. Wonderful service! The food was really good. I had a number 7 and garlic parmesan fries."}
{"text":"I'm shocked this place has such a high rating. Maybe because the guy is from philly people think it's authentic, or possibly because he uses cheese wiz like Pat's. Anyway I don't eat hydrogenated cheese food product so I chose the cheese steak hoagie. The first time we went we were taken back because the lettuce and tomato were underneath the meat. Making them soggy and warm. We decided to give them a 2nd chance and requested the veggies be on top of the meat and cheese but they totally disregarded our request and made it the same as usual, another sloppy mess. I'll give them 2 stars because he does use Amoroso rolls and the Philly team's window art is cool."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, the one off warm springs I feel like it's better. But both locations are really good. I'm addicted to the philly cheese steak."}
{"text":"Sweet Philly Jesus this is a great hidden lil spot. I am a Philly fiend and since I moved to NV i've found good but not great, till now. The area where this is located is quite small inside but you can grab and go or if you luck out you can sit down and chow down. The staff is very polite and quickly delivers the goods. The menu offers quite a bit of options, unfortunately they do not have combo deals so it's a la carte. The philly's are large and lovely I opt to get them with the whiz, which I can't explain but makes it phillynomenal . The steak is cooked just right and has flavor not gnarly ness like so many other folks try to pass off. The Bread is soft and tender and holds in the meaty cheesy goodness. The fries are quite good as well and compliments the sandwich nicely. The two times I have visited, were great and I was able to quench my hunger. Keep up the good work and keep the good food coming!"}
{"text":"Friendly service , drive thru is on the long side and they didn't get our order right! No cheese whiz and I asked for no tomatoes and they did t give us that! 
Could have used more mayonnaise on the sandwiches!
Super Friendly though I would definitely give them another chance! Maybe dinning in next time"}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru and the service was friendly, food took some time but I am cool with knowing it is freshly made... I had a Philly hogie with whiz and mushrooms.. the sandwich was good size and stuffed full, but mostly with mushrooms and onions.. they do charge extra for bell and mushroom and lettuce and tomato not happy with that but I'd go back and try the chicken philly next!!"}
{"text":"This business took over the Hotdog on a Stick joint.   Awesome.  I'll take a nice Philly steak over a hotdog any day!   We arrived an hour before close and were warmly greeted by nice staff.  I ordered the Philly Fanatic Steak:  Provolone, American, and Cheez Whiz plus chili.   Never had it with chili and I must say that I am a fan.  

My wife had a the original philly with cheez whiz.   While standard for the whiz to be spread on the bread, my wife said she would have preferred it if they added more cheez whiz over the steak as well.  

The additional complimentary side of hot peppers for the sandwiches were amazing.  I had to ask for more which the guy up front happily gave to me.  

The place was clean.  The employees were amicable.  The phillys were delicious.   I'll be back again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Wow! Now I've never had a true cheese steak before, so I don't know how this compares, but it was so good! The meat was super tender and the bread was great. Right down the street from me so I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Hit the drive thru and grabbed a \"Wiz Wit\". I liked it very much and will be back for sure. Definitely pricey to eat there a few times a week, but once a month it's not bad when you need that Philly Cheesesteak after a late night out in Vegas. Ingredients used were high quality from the Rib-eye, Wiz, Soft Roll, Cherry Peppers. All top notch!"}
{"text":"Although this is a chain restuarant, their name is correct. I have only gotten beef and chicken cheese steaks (variety of cheeses) and fries here. Their cheesesteaks are some of the most authentic I have tasted. They feature ribeye steak your choice of cheese (yea, they have cheese wiz if that's your deal). The icing one the steak is that they feature Amoroso's bread which is the official Philly Cheesesteak roll and without which you can't have an authentic cheesesteak. This location is in a weird location almost into Anthem at the back of a shopping center, but worth the trip if you are around Eastern and St. Rose area."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a great Philly cheesesteak sand which, ya know the authentic kind from back east. After all, that's what the name claims to this drive they Resteraunt. Hankering all day, I got to work an hour early to make sure I could grab one before my 14 hour overnight shift. My friend and I decided to head down and see if this Resteraunt lives up to the name. 

We walked in and it was empty. A lady
Who I assume was family or the owner was sitting in the dining area writing and coloring with her kid, there was like 5 people behind the counter. ( seemed a little over staffed considering it was dead)! The decode was blah and it was not welcoming at all. I went to the counter to order. Pretty simple, two Philly cheesesteaks no onions and one with extra cheese and two chili cheese fries. The little girl behind the counter had to ask me three times to repeat my order ¿? Ok, I did... I'll let it slide. I ordered a drink and paid. I asked for a receipt. I waited... and waited... (insert suspenseful music here) finally I looked st her and said \"can I please have my receipt...?\" She chuckled and said.. \"Oh ahaha, I was wondering why you were standing here still!!!!!!\" WTF? Ok... first stirke.

I use the restroom and come out to get my drink... Oh wait!!! There's no drink machine? I ask the little girl where I get the drink. Not in the dining area but a back right corner behind two walls hardly seen.... ( Who thought that was a good idea? ) Wondering now if mom and pop have any idea about marketing or advertising putting the drink machine where people can see it might stimulate them to buy.... I digress... Strike 2

We receive our order and leave. .My mistake! I should have checked it before we left. My friend and I arrive back at work and eagerly open out food. His had onions and mine had NO EXTRA CHEESE! Officially irritated. We were so hungry we scarfed the food which was flavorless and lack luster And smashes the fries. After we are we looked at each other and said in unison, \"disappointed!\" 

I've eaten slot of little places in town for Philly's and I honestly have to say this one although not some or two star be cause they were at least clean, is at the bottom of the list. I won't be returning... Not for the price or the flavor... And side note: Your a brand new businesses with no customers.... But.u couldn't get two sandwiches right??? Doesn't say much for you."}
{"text":"Straight From Philly Steakout!!
Amazing!!!  I am now in love with this place. I ordered a Chicken Philly with green peppers, red peppers, provolone and fried onions. On a toasted bun! My meal came just as stated and on the menu.
The location is very misleading as SFPS is located a little off to the side, you will have to look a little for the building, parking is plenty.  The location is very small only about four or five tables for sitting,  but not to worry if you don't want to dine in they have a drive through and you can always order to go. Items not listed within the menu are Fire Fries, Parm and Garlic fries. I didn't get a chance to try anything else but the Sandwich. Cooked to perfection I could actually see and taste the cheese as well as the peppers, my bun without Mayo still gave off a buttery fresh taste, the seasoning  of my chicken steak was lacking in salt but I want to say maybe this was done for the customers benefit as everything else was right on point. I would absolutely come again and again and again but next time I would order French fries. At the rate of $9.00 per sandwich large enough to share cut in half SFPS will be my go to location. They also offer cold sandwiches, and the original beef Cheese Steak."}
{"text":"Well, just ordered delivery from this location. Received the wrong order. Called Yelp Customer Service, and notified them of my dilemma. Placed on hold while they contacted the driver & the restaurant. Driver said what was delivered was the only order at the restaurant & the restaurant said the driver picked up the wrong order. Doesn't matter, I the consumer got fucked! No lunch for my guests today, making me look like a total fool. Customer Service cancelled my order & my credit card will be refunded in 3-5 business days. It's a  holiday-fucking-weekend asshole! 3-5 days !!! Kiss my ass!!! I asked Customer Service what I should do with the food that was delivered. \" Well sir, we don't know what you should do with the food.\" Glad I have a big Rottweiler that likes Parmesan cheese fries. This is just a good example of technology that doesn't work. Get the the consumer's order correct & deliver the right order! Is that too much to ask!? Better yet, send a driverless car........they'll have an accident & I'll never be able to eat!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Philly cheesesteak spots in Las Vegas! Customer service is excellent and they give you a decent amount of food for a great price! Will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great Italian sub, probably one of the best i have had. Great food."}
{"text":"That was a really good cheesesteak. Just like home in jersey. Way better than pops down the street and they have a drive thru and dining room to sit down. What else can you ask for?
I got mine with marinara sauce and American cheese. The way it's suppose to be. Highly recommend and I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"So I  keep looking for a great cheese steak to match my favorite place in San Diego,  been to a few spots here in Vegas,  well I found this little gem of a place its close to home, but kinda hidden which for a local is great. Met with one of the owners, who's  from s. Philly, she doesn't like tomatoes, i thought everybody from the east coast liked tomatoes,   but that's ok, she's a very nice woman. Remember don't tell my wife I was here without her.  On to the food, got the cheese steak hoagie, meat was seasoned nicely at first I thought they were kind of skimpy on the amount of meat, but I was wrong, lettuce was crisp, tomatoe fresh, and I got mine with provolone and grilled onions, which were done just right.  I ordered plain fries, which were crispy outside and airy in, just the way I like em.  So I made a deal with the owner who promised not to recognize me when I take my wife ,so I don't get in trouble for going without her.  Next time I get the chili fries and Philly with peppers onions and mushrooms. Thanks for the great food,  see ya soon"}
{"text":"Finally was in the area to try this place out...it was so good...the meat was cooked perfect, just the right amount of onions and peppers, and the bread was nice and soft...my only issue was there was not enough cheese for me personally...I totally was expecting lots of cheese especially when I saw the pictures posted...but even without the lots of cheese that I was expecting it still is one of the best Philly Cheese Steaks that I have had in Vegas...but next time I will definitely ask for extra cheese..and the guys who work there were really cool"}
{"text":"Omg! So excited I found a Philly Cheese steak that actually taste like I'm in PHILLY!!! Definitely recommend this spot if you want to eat a good Philly steak sandwich! This is my third time coming here and I must say I'm definitely hooked!! The cook Kenny is awesome and the staff is really friendly and outgoing. Angelique recommended the # 2 and it was BOMB! can't wait to try the hoagies and everything else that's on the menu."}
{"text":"Ah, yes! So glad we took up the opportunity to try this place again. They didn't disappoint and the philly special was delicious!! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent #6. Mushrooms & green bell peppers with provolone cheese. Lots of meat. The chili cheese fries are delicious too. The Best steak sandwich in Vegas. You must try this place"}
{"text":"First of all. The place has a drive-thru. Can you say perfect! I'm always on the run and I never really have time to stop and sit and eat the drive thru was perfect. Although the prices on the drive thru menu were mismarked, it was pretty fast and effective.

I got a #13 American Chicken. It came in a nice sub bag with the companies logo. Once you take the sandwich out the bag it is wrapped in another two layers of paper. The grease was coming through these layers. If you've ever been to philly then you will know that this means authentic cheesesteak!!!! Yum. 

This was the messiest, sloppiest , most delicious sandwich I've ever had in my entire life. Have lots of napkins ready because it will get messy! I got hot peppers on the side but they were unnecessary . The flavor was amazing and I'm sure I'm going to have a heart attack later but it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"UNREAL , SO EXCITED TO HAVE FOUND THIS PLACE !!! great phillys, kind service, fast, hot, fresh and even has a drive through.  Excellent!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a dive, but the cheesesteak that comes from this tiny kitchen will rival any Philly place  I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Really authentic Philly Cheesesteak. The bread was awesome and a wide variety of cheesesteaks to choose from.   Staff is super welcoming and friendly.  Great place to get a real Philly Cheesesteak outside of Philadelphia."}
{"text":"Heard that the original owners were back in the area and had opened in the location that formally hosted a Hot Dog on the Stick. You can easily pass it if you didn't know it was there already, but hopefully better signage is on the way. 

Service was friendly and quick through the drive-thru and they offered an apple and a drink on the house with each sandwich. 

The most important part, the food...
Good portions and fresh ingredients as we've grown to expect. The beef could use another shake or two of seasoning. Fries are packaged in a plastic to go container with no ventilation...BIG no no. They sweat and become soggy. I am sure some folks like that, but I prefer crispy fries. 

Overall, good meal and service, but probably better if you have the time to eat in."}
{"text":"You can't get anymore authentic than this, unless you're in Philly! The bread is soft, the cheese wiz is authentic and steak is cut to perfection. Definitely recommend the #6 with chili cheese fries or cheese wiz fries."}
{"text":"I grew up in philly and I too agree with the reviews...this place is legit.  One of the best tries outside of philly of the \"typical\" neighborhood cheesesteak.  I recommend this.  I wish they had pizza fries and sweet peppers, but the steak is a good start"}
{"text":"So excited to see you guys back on the old neighborhood! Best cheesesteak in town by far! And I love that you have a drive thru now.  Family owed place that keeps the food quality high and doesn't skimp on the products like another nearby place. Welcome back!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a cheesesteak, which I'm always on the hunt for here in Vegas.  This place was recommended by neighbors on the Next Door App.  I have to say it was pretty good!  The bread was so soft the meat and cheese tasted great. It came out really hot like I like my food.  I also had the chili fries which were ok too much cheese wiz."}
{"text":"I used to go to Pop's quite a bit, but as the prices have gone up, the quality has gone way down.  Someone told me about this place and said the people that own this, were the former owners of Pop's.   Now unlike Pop's, they are not open 24/7/365, but they do have a dining room, so you don't have to eat in the sweltering heat of Vegas Summers in a crappy neighborhood.  We ordered sandwiches from here, for our staff at work last night.  I had the Provolone Cheesesteak.   Now, I will say that the meat was the most tender I've ever had on a cheesesteak.   Could not tell if it was an Amaroso's Bakery Roll, but it was good.   The two things that were slight downsides is that the Provolone must be sliced razor thin, because I barely saw it on the bottom of my roll and could not taste it at all.  It just tasted like a normal steak sandwich, minus the cheese.  Next time, I'll get the American Cheese and I'll ask for extra cheese.  The whiz is way too messy and cheap.  Also, the steak needed some seasoning.  It was very bland.  But I will take the great quality of the meat and it being bland over it being tough and seasoned.  I'll just make sure to grab some salt and pepper next time.  Overall, a great sandwich and look forward to eating there again next time I want a cheesesteak."}
{"text":"What can I say except that this place really has great food! We got #9 (philly), #21 (Italian), chilly cheese fries and mot sticks. Whatever brand provolone cheese they use taste delicious and isn't over powering. 

You only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because it was my first time trying and if the flavor don't change the next time I come I will give it a 5."}
{"text":"OMG, nicest, friendliest, coolest guys ever!  Super clean, a lot of food, and tasty!  If you love a Philly cheese steak, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. This is the original Vegas Philly Cheesesteak, best in town. Drive thru is quick and the food is always hot and fresh. Don't go to that other place on Decatur, this is the original owner of that place. Tastes better than ever"}
{"text":"One of the better cheesesteaks west of Philly no doubt! Perfect bread (amoroso) quality meat (not greasy) and perfectly grilled peppers onions mushrooms. I got the garlic parmesan fried as my side, I thought they were just okay, was expecting fresh garlic but it wasn't a make or break. Reasonably priced and high quality sandwich joint in Henderson (non-corporate) just how I like it! Will definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak I've had in vegas.  Generous amount of meat and cheese, would highly recommend.  Wife and I got 2 steaks and 1 fry, came in around $21"}
{"text":"When I heard that the original owners of Straight From Philly Steakout who used to be at Alta and Decatur where Pop's is today were taking over this spot from the now closed Hotdog on a Stick, I was excited. While in the area last night my hubby and I decided to stop here for dinner. I can't say anything tasted like I remembered or I am just ruined by Pop's.

Grilled Hot Pastrami Sandwich ($10) - Pastrami, grilled onions, pickles and provolone. The pastrami wasn't very flavorful. The sandwich looked good, but just was average in taste. The best part of it was honestly the bread. 

Cheez Whiz Steak Sandwich ($9) - I can't say after taking my first bite that I wasn't impressed. The meat really lacked flavor and the grease was ridiculous. Grease soaked through the wrapper and bread. I see the owner responds to the negative reviews for this listing and the bashing of Pop's by them is unnecessary. Pop's puts out a legit cheesesteak and I have no problem paying a couple extra dollars to get more sandwich and extra flavor from them. I really wanted to truly like Straight From Philly Steakout, but just didn't. 

Besides steak they also have a chicken philly and a few cold sandwiches as well a few fried appetizers. One plus is they have Cherry Coke.

UPDATE: So of course I wrote a review less than 4 stars and I mentioned Pop's, so the owner had to respond to my review with no class. To assume I have never been to Philly is just ignorant. There is certain way to respond to customers and the way it's done absolutely reflects the business you will have, or not have because of such tackiness. When you open so close to Pop's, which is well loved by many in town, you are going to be judged against them it's not like there's a huge cheeseteak market here. The meat I had here at Straight from Philly Steakout tasted low grade, lacked flavor and was absurdly greasy and that's a fact. Pop's cheesesteak is legit and I'll drive across town for it any day over coming here."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 2 times.  Their cheesesteaks with mushrooms/ onions and cheese wiz were tops.  The only thing they need to work on is the bread they use.  After the meat and everything is put on the bread it makes the bread gross and soggy.  It kinda ruined an amazing meal. I mentioned to the manager that it was very soggy and I didn't care for it that much.  He suggested that next time I ask them to grill the bread.
The 2nd that's me I came in I told them my sandwich was soggy and gross so asked them to toast or grill the bread. They did but it didn't stop the bread from being soggy.  If I come back I will just eat the cheesesteak without the bread. I just think they are using the wrong bread"}
{"text":"Amazing and with real cheese wiz. Owner is extremely nice and steak is high quality and cooked perfectly with nice soft bread. Second time this week. Good location, clean store and drive through to boot. In other words perfect."}
{"text":"Are from philly steakout. Good pastrami sandwich. They add mustard like you get on the east coast. Clean restaurant. Friendly cashier. Food came out fast and was hot. Fries were extra hot excellent. About $15 for a combo. Be sure to check out capriottis for a pastrami sandwich as well."}
{"text":"Best philly I've had in Nevada  must try if your in Vegas   Closest thing to Philly. Got 2 cheesesteak and fries. Man o man. Need some deserts though"}
{"text":"Best Philly cheese steak sandwich I've had in Vegas. I ordered 2 Philly specials one with provolone and one with American cheese, both ended up with provolone which is fine. I also got my mother the hot pastrami sandwich which was also delicious."}
{"text":"Went straight in and had the original! It was very yummtastic!
Dining room is like 2 tables, go through the drive through and eat in your car like a regular American for Pete's sake.
This is the place in Vegas for a good ol' Philly sammich.
Get in my belly!"}
{"text":"Excellent cheese steak!  Got the Philly with peppers, mushrooms, grilled onions, and all 3 cheeses, American, provolone, and whiz.  Delicious, cheesy, hot, fresh, not too greasy, good French fries too.  If I had one suggestion it would be to put the soda fountain where guests can use it.  I'll be back often, check them out next time you're in the mood for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! Best Philly steak you'll find in Vegas. Brand new location on Arroyo Grande and Warm Springs"}
{"text":"The absolute BEST Philly in town! Been there a couple times and the food and service has been impeccable each time. The bread is so soft and fresh, flown from Philly, might I add. Food is made to order so you can expect melty cheesy goodness each and every time. Consistent! Sandwiches are always stuffed to the brim and leave you wanting more. The cooks are great and the staff is courteous and attentive. Place is very clean as well. Inside and outside. The convenience of the drive thru is def worth mentioning! I will for sure be back!
Also I had #10 with light grilled onions and the Garlic Parmesan Fries!!!!!O M G!!!!!soooooooooo good!!!! This place is legit!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but wait time totally SUCKED.  Went through drive-thru and ordered the Special and Hoagie cheesesteaks and pizza fries.  All their sandwiches come on a 9\" amoroso roll, so there's no option for those that don't want to eat that huge of a sandwich, or those that want to order something for their kiddies.  The main street is so noisy that the girl thought I said cheese fries, so that's what I ended up getting instead of pizza fries.  I was the only car in drive-thru and I'm pretty sure there were no other patrons inside...I sat at the pick-up window for about 17 minutes!  Yes, 17 minutes!  There were at least 3 workers in there that I could see. WOW....I don't ever remember taking that long for one order when i worked at the Cheesesteak Shop in Cali.  Management/service needs to step it up a notch otherwise they won't last too long at this location...maybe one location is all they can handle."}
{"text":"Awful!! This was my first and last time eating here. Bread was terrible and the cheesesteak fillings (or lack of!!) were ridiculous. Never again."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place last night for my family and it was aweful all the way around. Went through the drive through along with one other car and it took a very long time. Plus all I had was 100 dollar bill which they could not change at 7pm. Got two steak sandwiches, a meatball sandwich, and two orders of fries. Total came out to almost 35 dollars and when I got home and looked at the food I was disappointed to say the least. The sandwiches were tiny, the meatball sandwich was so bad my kids who eat everything both said yuck. The bread on all 3 tiny sandwiches were hard as a rock. There were a couple fries in each order and the fries were not even close to being done. They were so soggy. We ended up throwing everything away. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"You guys come back to Vegas and I move to Los Angeles, Fuck my life! Best philly in Vegas period!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Had an amazing experience, thanks to the workers (Andrew, Kenny and Mikey) providing the best customer service as well as the delicious food.

Pros: the quality of the bread and meat was perfect and couldn't ask for anything better. Plenty of amazing toppings to choose from as well as sauces. Cheese whiz was great as well on the fries.

Cons: NONE

Can't wait to try the pastrami on the hoagie roll next time! Overall, you gotta try this spot out if you appreciate good quality food."}
{"text":"They lock their doors on the dot. If you want a cheese steak on a Friday night in Vegas, make sure you get here by 7:59!"}
{"text":"My first night was okay. I myself have never had a hoagie so I healed high expectations; It was \"Ight.\" The \"Philly\" on the other had, was \"Smooth\". The steak was sliced very fine and with the original Wiz Cheese topping, My entree was upheld and mighty filling. Over all, it was a fun experience. Although it my first visit, it won't be my last."}
{"text":"I wish I could eat here every day. The sandwiches are loaded with meats, peppers, and cheeses. You can build your own or try one they have created. The bread is soft. The fries are crispy on the outside, but hot and perfect in the middle. I recommend sharing a sandwich and fries with someone, because they are both large enough. 

I went on a trip a few years ago to Philadelphia and had several cheesesteak sandwiches while I was there. These rival those, for sure. 

The wait time is a little long, especially at the drive-thru but well worth it."}
{"text":"Where this Straight From Philly is located has been many other places in the past. Nothing seems to last too long. Will they suffer the same fate? Who could say? Only time will tell that tale. I can only tell you my story.

I came in on Thursday afternoon for lunch. There was one customer leaving when I arrived. I was the only person eating there. I noticed maybe two drive-thru customers. During my time in-store.

I ordered a cheese steak with onions, peppers, mushroom and cheese whiz. To me that is the ultimate Philly. Traditional to me and has all of my favorites in one sandwich. It came out quickly much to my happy surprise. Other Philly places have taken so very long. But like I mentioned, it wasn't busy. 

The sandwich was HOT! Hard to pick up even. So imagine that first bite with the molten yellow-orange cheese oozing everywhere. It was almost hard to eat but I had to keep going. Its so much better hot. I made a total mess with every bite. I wished I had a fork to scoop of the goodness but I settled for my fingers. Hell, there was nobody there to judge me anyhow. It was a craveable sandwich complete with salty and savory flavors all through the hoagie roll which was actually a little soft for my liking. I didn't want to let any of that go to waste.

The sandwich was $10. A little on the pricey side but not really unreasonable. It was a good sandwich in terms of flavor. Perhaps not the best or even biggest Philly I've had but solid. There is a lot they are doing right in this place down to the complimentary apples by the register. One per customer, please. There are a couple of things which irritate me though. The older gentleman, for example, who spent more time outside smoking than actually in ths store helping to cook. I suppose when its quiet he can afford to leave the store behind for a bit. I just don't like it. Another pet peeve, as I drove back to work I passed by another Philly Cheese Steak place not too far away. Less than a block before I passed by that store I saw a man with a large sign telling me to turn around and go to Straight From Philly. I don't disagree with advertising but to be so blatant so close to a \"rival\" seems unnecessary. I admit, it made me chuckle but I don't like it. Will that dissuade me from going to either? Not likely. I have been to both places and I happen to like both places. But they are different and respectible in their own right offering a different experience and atmosphere. I will go to each in the future depending on my situation and time frame. No need to resort to childish games. Ok, I'll get off my high horse now. Enjoy a sandwich wherever you choose to go. You can't go wrong with a Philly Cheese Steak."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I was a bit skeptical of trying this place at first as I simply wasn't a fan of the location. This sandwich spot recently opened in the same suite as a former Hotdog on a Stick location which looked very run down far too long. I must say that the new owners were able to spruce up the suite a bit when they took over, but it's definitely still hard to recognize if they are even open as their advertising is minimal. I know they say you should never judge a book by its cover, but that's what I did with this place and had I abandoned that mindset earlier, then I certainly would've been indulging in delicious cheesesteaks a lot sooner! 

Anywho, I decided to stop judging one Saturday evening and pop in to try a sub or two. I ordered a Philly cheesesteak with whiz, mushrooms, and hot peppers. Omg it was literally melt in your mouth delicious! I also decided to order a cold Italian sub so I could have it for lunch the next day. These employees truly know how to load up a sandwich and that sub was packed with layers upon layers of savory meats. I truly enjoyed every last bite of it! Plus the prices were reasonable per sub and the staff was fast and friendly. So next time you're in the henderson area and get a hankering for a bomb sub, stop by this place. You'll be please you did."}
{"text":"Loved our sandwiches here and it's super close by! Very hard to find a good philly in Henderson, but this place is on the corner of warm springs and arroyo grande. Not far from the galleria mall. And the food came out quick!"}
{"text":"I try to be honest in my reviews. I seem to remember this sandwich being a LOT bigger back in the day. I think 4 stars is generous. The sandwich was surprisingly small although tasty. I'm glad I ordered fries because I would have been hungry afterwards. Seriously, Jersey Mike's makes a better Philly cheesesteak."}
{"text":"I was so nervous to try this place because everyone raved about pops and it was so gross. I decided to give Philly Steakout a try and it was so good! I gave it 4 stars because my fries weren't all the way cooked but I'll be back"}
{"text":"Listen, folks! I'm a consummate foodie. I've stood in Philly in the snow and bearing sun to enjoy a cheesesteak. I know that no matter where I am, it'll never be like a south philly classic steak sandwich. This joint here is the closest thing to the real deal in all of Vegas. Straight bomb!"}
{"text":"Friendliest service and amazing Phillies.  Must get the Parmesan garlic fries!! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"A solid spot for a good Philly cheesesteak. The inside of the restaurant is on the small side with a few tables for dining in. That's fine since this seems more like food you grab on the go or for home. 

My husband and I went with the Pepper Chicken Steak, Philly Steak Special, and Fries (add garlic parmesan seasoning). The Philly Steak Special was my favorite. Both sandwiches came on chewy, soft bread with nicely flavored meat. There was just the right amount of cheese and veggies. The sandwiches were not greasy at all. The fries were good with the seasoning on top. They offer several seasonings to add to the fries that all sounded good.

Pricing is reasonable for the quality and size of the sandwich. Two people can eat for around $20 and it's plenty of food."}
{"text":"This is a fast food place with good quality. I must say that I expected a bit more flavor of all the ingredients or maybe some seasoning to add uniqueness. I will give it a try in a few weeks and look for improvements. It is possible that I have higher expectation having been to a few awesome places in Philly too. If you are looking for a quick bite in the $9 range, this is a good choice especially if you are looking to get out of your usual lunch routine."}
{"text":"I was pleased if you're looking for a good philly in Vegas then I would stop here. The meat was great and the buns are shipped from Philly. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Hands down, the place to go to for great philly sandwich! The restaurant has a drive-thru, so if you want a sandwich as soon as possible, you're good! My boyfriend and I decided to eat inside, and the place was small, you can tell because there's only four tables! The cashier who helped us out was really nice, and reassured us that this was the best place in Las Vegas to get a philly. We didn't wait long for our food to be ready. The philly sandwiches are all $9 across the board expect for two, which are $7 and $8. I ordered the Chicken Special philly, and my boyfriend had the Philly special. They were both really good, and I really liked that the sandwiches weren't too greasy. It's a good size sub, and will definitely fill you up on one sub, so the sides are a bonus if you're super hungry. With our sandwiches, two cokes, and a side of fries our total was $23, super reasonable for everything we got!"}
{"text":"This. Is. Home.

From the OG Amoroso bread, to the option of Cheese Whiz in your sandwich, their Philly Cheesesteaks are unparalleled in Las Vegas in my opinion. I'm so glad through all their relocations that this place still exists. If I could have the hots for an establishment, this place would definitely do it. Because I'm crushing hard on their food. 

Anyone who knows me knows I am a Philly Cheesesteak guy which is likely while I'll die early, but that being said, when you find a place that can really just straight up DO. IT. RIGHT... you stay loyal. So since I'm not a girl in a Chris Brown music video, this hoe will be loyal.

I recommend the Philly with mushrooms added. It's a new world of taste good that accents the steak very well. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"I was leaving a meeting starving and in desperate need of food when a sign caught my eye. \"Straight From Philly Cheesesteaks\". Best part? THEY WERE RIGHT ACROSS FROM POPS! That kind of aggressive, in your face marketing against competitors is something I truly appreciate. Naturally, I asked for a menu and headed straight to them. 

I ordered the cheesesteak special and the philly phanatic. Both were amazing!! Cheesesteaks are among my favorite sandwiches and meals. I'll be back and often! Make sure it stop by and have some. After I ate mine, I literally called the owner and told him thank you for reminding my why I love phillys."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good quality Philly cheesesteak in Vegas. So I was excited to see this establishment open so close to my house! I tried the provolone cheesesteak with the grilled onions and it was absolutely amazing ! Meat was tender and not chewy and had a great flavor. The staff was very friendly and made our first experience here delightful. I can definitely see myself coming here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"First time here , Service is great! Philly was a little bland to me and Needed a little more flavor."}
{"text":"This place is so good!! I literally think this is the best place for phillys. Although they close a little early I love this place. Just wish they were open later lol. I get the number 9 and omg it's delicious!!"}
{"text":"Try the number 10 and 2 with a ton of hot peppers! Makes for a damn good cheese steak!"}
{"text":"A nice surprise. We were looking on Yelp for a place for lunch and this was close by. Ordered the pastrami sandwich and kept my fingers crossed. I don't know about you but I've ordered pastrami from restaurants before that would barely passed for shoe soles. I was pleasantly surprised with a nice size sandwich (I thought I would have to take part of it home). The pastrami was tender and smoky, the bread was fresh and soft, and yes I ended up eating the whole thing. Definitely five stars"}
{"text":"This review is based on take out service only. I've had food from Steakout 5 or 6 times so far and each time my husband picked up the food so I haven't actually stepped inside the restaurant. My husband did tell me that the place was clean inside. 

Food - so far we have tried the Cheese Steaks, Fish and Chips and Chicken WIngs. For take out food it is really good. I especially liked the honey barbecue chicken wings, great flavor and just the right amount of sauce. Very reasonably priced. 

Location - The restaurant is tucked away in Athem near Vons which is great for us since its 5 minutes away from home. If you live in Anthem you'll understand how great this is since there's not too many choices that close. 

If you like Cheese Steaks I'd say give this place a try."}
{"text":"A small hole in the wall at a small strip mall. Not a lot of table space,with room for maybe 12-16 people. But, it is worth your while to go here. My wife and I both had a pastrami sandwich and they were very good. My wife liked that the pastrami was very lean. I liked that it was very flavorful. Since it is a philly-cheese place I should have a philly. I find there are few good sandwich places in Vegas. There a lot of OK places but none that are exceptional. I think this place is at the upper level but I have to go back and try a philly. I will go back and encourage others to try it. Watch for my philly review which will be coming soon.."}
{"text":"This place is the legit spot for a Philly steak sandwich! I ordered the Philly Phanatic Steak which has chili, provolone, American cheese, and cheese whiz. I opted for no cheer whiz though and it was absolutely delicious! The meat was tender, well seasoned, and not dry at all. The bread was soft and cushioned all the meaty cheesy goodness perfectly. I also ordered the Provolone Cheese Steak and it was straight to the point of what I wanted. Meat and cheese. Sounds simple, but sometimes it's the so called \"simple\" things that is so hard to get right and Straight From Philly Steakout gets it right every time. Service is friendly and straight forward. They have a big menu on the wall right when you walk in. The store is really clean and there is some seating in the store if you wanted to sit down and eat. The best part about this place that I found out is the meat and bread is literally from Philadelphia! That's why it tastes so authentic. So the store name Straight from Philly isn't just a catchy name-it's legitimately a Philly cheese steak from the PA. I do have to give credit to the cooks at this store though. They are so friendly and the care they put into making an authentic Philly sandwich really shows. I am so glad I gave this place a try. Also, they are located in a strip mall where an auto repair shop is so sometimes you have to be careful of cars coming and going in the parking lot. All in all, I think I finally found my spot for real hearty Philly sandwich. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"LEGIT! LEGIT! LEGIT!

I grew up in NY and NJ.  Part of my time in NJ wasn't too far from Philly so I've been missing this stuff so much.

So much of a great Philly steak sandwich is the bread and they ship in the real deal.  In style, this is closest to Pat's as I've had out here.  

I got the cheese whiz steak with onions( or a wit with whiz as it's traditionally known) and the onions were done right, little pieces, not long strands.  

Juicy steak, soft bread, perfectly grilled onions and the right amount of cheezy goodness!"}
{"text":"This is seriously the best cheese steak I have had in town in years! The staff was so friendly and interactive which was great. Angelique recommended the Philly Steak Special and I will be back for sure. There were so many items on the menu that I wanted to try so I also got the Grilled Hot Pastrami Sandwich which did not disappoint. I live on the other side of town but will definitely be back again for more. Keep up the great job! Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Just like the old days in the old neighborhood! I can't beleive they're back and boy are they back. Perfect sandwich! My inner fat kid is singing and dancing right now. 

Location is super easy to get in, right at the light, and they have a drive-thru. Thank goodness. Patio has area with sun and shade. It's super clean and employees really friendly."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic cheesesteak and don't want to have to go to Philly to get it - go here! My husband went to UPenn and this is our slice of Philly in Vegas! We've only had the cheesesteaks, they're so yummy we haven't explored the rest of the menu yet. The only other thing we've tried are the cheese fries, they are certainly a guilty pleasure of mine! 

Whether you opt. for Geno's recommendation with provolone or Pat's best seller with cheese whiz, you are going to enjoy a great cheesesteak!"}
{"text":"Sooo dam nice to have it Real again you guys are back on my map that's for sure so after I'm done eating the rest of my sandwich I will be sure to inform everybody I know that the Real deal steakout is back thank you Steakout God loved it"}
{"text":"A little pricey but definitely worth it if you eat it  freshly made. Staff super friendly and honest. 
Best Philly cheese steaks in Vegas hands down!
Rewards program soon to come."}
{"text":"Authentic cheese steaks and extremely hospitable! The parmesan and garlic fries were amazing."}
{"text":"Best philly I have ever had! The service was super friendly as well. The only complaint I have is the fries melted through the styrofoam box.  But I am for sure going to be a repeat customer. this is right down the road from me!"}
{"text":"Bombdocious!! Whenever you see the City of Philadelphias name incorporated into the name of the business I get Nervous..... but this is a hidden gem in the city of Las vegas! I was always taught \"If they dont have amirosa rolls then it aint A real Philly cheesesteak!! So Before even going to this place i called and asked \"me hat kind of bread do you serve your cheesteaks on\" to which he replied \"Amirosas\" we drove right over....

Small quiet place seats about 20-30 Great location fast service and Great Tasting Fresh Cheesteaks!! I will Be back...."}
{"text":"Philly cheesesteak special with mushrooms and onions was ok. I would rate it 3.5 out of 5. Fries was not worth the money. Would rate the chilli cheese fries 2 out of 5. Price is too much for what it is. One time experience for me and that's enough for this place."}
{"text":"The PLACE IS LONG-GONE!  It's not in anthem nor is it next to Island sushi off of Eastern Avenue anymore -- long gone! thanks a lot Yelp U which made me waste about half an hour of my life trying to find a place"}
{"text":"Great Pizza Steak sandwich, price was right for this hero and its actually in walking distance from home. Will be going back often :)"}
{"text":"First of all,  incredible customer service! I love cheez wiz so the cheese fries were my all time favorite.  I had the philly with mushrooms and onions,  so good."}
{"text":"We are so glad these guys are back in town! They are the best in the Vegas Philly world. Much more flavor than that other place down the street. Delicious meat perfectly seasoned and placed inside a perfect roll just right for the job. I love the combination of green and red peppers. Add provolone, mushrooms and onions fantastic. Must mention a free apple with sandwich. Great fries, crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Did I say I love this place?"}
{"text":"The food here is okay.  The garlic parmesan fries are way over-priced compared to the regular fries - a lot of salt and a little parmesan for $2.00 more than the regular fries. 
Called one Saturday evening at about 7:30pm (when they were supposed to be open, but the phone just rang and rang without being answered. Tried at least 3 more times, but still no answer, so I guess they just close when they feel like it regardless of their posted hours.  Called on another Saturday evening to place an order (as they have always recommended me to do) between 7:00pm and 8:00pm. Tried to ask about some sandwiches that we had not previously tried before, but the jerk on the other end of the phone rudely told me that they were busy and didn't really have time to answer questions. I immediately told him that we were no longer interested in his sandwiches and he could cancel the order. It have never been that busy any of the times we have stopped in and placed an order in person that would warrant his rudeness.  No matter, we ordered from Sal's Pizza that night and haven't looked back since."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food fresh and delicious!! If you are in the neighborhood you should try it. You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Best Philly sandwich I've ever had. I've not been to Philly, but have heard about the 'proper way' a cheese steak sandwich made. They used the cheese wiz and it is amazing!!! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Straight from Philly Steakout. They are now in Henderson just a few blocks from our home so we decided to try them out. Always fun to support local business and a neighborhood one as well. It's a quaint shop where Hot Dog on a Stick used to be. Menu is small and easy to choose from. As we arrived we were greeted at the counter and we perused the simple menu. I decided on the Philly fanatic sandwich and Josie had a simple cheez wiz steak sandwich. also some cheese wiz fries. Philly Fanatic; Chili Beef and all three cheeses, Provolone, Cheez wiz and American. Good sized sandwich and and a gooey awesome mess of meat, cheese and chili. Incredible flavor, I had to end up using a fork just because of how big it was and how it got a bit messy. I am okay with the mess, they did not skimp on the ingredients. The Cheese wiz steak sandwich did not disappoint either. Bread was fresh and had a great portion of meat as well. cheese fries had ample amount of cheese per fry.
Thank you for dining at Straight from Philly steakout. We will go here again, as a mattter of fact we have been back since out initial visit. Go check them out. Great people, incredible food."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the parking lot is a nightmare.  I won't hold that against them.  

The service was super friendly and super fast.  So they get bonus stars for that. 

While the food is tasty when i added mustard and hot sauce.  Read into that what you will.  There is also not much meat in the sandwich.   I ordered the wiz without and the gentleman taking my order had no idea what i wanted.  Then i order a wiz with add peepers and mushrooms and he ask what cheese i wanted.   That sandwich was mostly mushrooms and peppers."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out! My fiancé is an Eagles fan and he got a free drink for wearing an Eagles hat! The sandwiches were delicious and the service was great too!"}
{"text":"OMG, I have been very excited since they came back, This is the original Philly Steak that is now Pops, from what I understand, the owner sold it to Pops and now they are back to do some real business. I have been here multiple times already, and I have to be honest some days are not so great but for the most part, it is sooooo good. It make you crave for it over and over again. I just like the plain Philly Steak with provolone (#4 i think). Owner and employees are super nice too."}
{"text":"Best steak sandwich we have had since we move here 3 yrs ago. Place was clean, fast and absolutely great!"}
{"text":"First time going to this place, and man, do they make it seem as authentic as I imagine an authentic Philly cheesesteak place in Vegas would be. 
I'm at the window and the guy with the tastefully offensive tattoos says to me, he says \"Hey, whats kinda Cheese do you wants in ya sandwich?\" To which I replied, \"Dearest purveyor of Philadelphian goods, I would that you garnish my meal with your finest provolone, post haste!\" He turns from the window and is accosted by the voice on the drive thru speaker. Furiously pointing at his order pad he yells \"Why'd you ask him that? It's right here in the pad!\" He yells back \"Well I wouldntahadta ask if I could read your F***in' CHICKEN SCRATCHES!\" It was just as I imagine it is in the cheesesteak mines of Philadelphia.
 I got home with the sandwich and the grease had soaked through the wrapper! It reminded me of that episode of Fresh Prince when DJ Jazzy Jeff visited Will in Bel Air and he brought him a philly cheese that had totally soaked through the bag. They commented that the grease soakage is a true sign of a quality cheesesteak sandwich. Then again, I mean, how long is a sandwich like that gone keep? You'd have to assume he chose to fly from Philly, not take a cab like Will did. Still, that's at least one layover. Was the sandwich REALLY gonna be that good anymore? I digress.
Bottom line: The food is good. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Reasonable prices. I got the cheese wiz it was good. Had to eat it quick though bread did get a little soggy but other than that it was good. Big plus they have Cherry Coke on their fountain machine so oh yeah!! And free apples."}
{"text":"Just went through the drive-through and got a chicken mushroom cheesesteak with provolone and pickles. Meh. The chicken isn't really seasoned at all and is kind of dry. I grew up outside of Philly and this definitely doesn't taste like anything I've ever had in Philly. Also, the credit card receipt asks for a tip. This practice really annoys and confounds me. Do they ask for tips at McDonald's? I find it obnoxious when they are already charging $9.00 for a mediocre sandwich. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most authentic Philly Cheesesteak in town!! Great service! Friendly staff! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I drove through thinking I was ordering corn dogs but that didn't happen haha I then got the pleasure of talking to Scott and becoming friends! He built me the best cheesesteak and onions I've ever had!!  I'm obsessed!! Thank you Scott!!!!!!! I'll be back soon! Like.... tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"This is an update. Since the last time I went there and the cook took precooked meat from a metal pan on the warm side of the grill. That's a definite \"no\" in my opinion. I figured I would give them another chance since I love cheese steaks so much. Well, the same thing happened again. There was a older gentlemen there with a Straight From Philly shirt on so I asked him if he was the owner. I said, \"Hello sir, are you the owner of this establishment?\". He said, \"Yes I am\" and walked away. As I was standing there and looking at the cook taking precooked meat from that metal pan on the grill. So I figured he is OK with that process. Like I said in a previous review, they have all the right ingredients, but if they do not cook it properly it will not be a good Philly!"}
{"text":"Moved 3 days ago to our new house and this spot is a 3 min drive from the house and I'm soooooo happy it is. The employee at the drive thru was really friendly.  I had the philly chicken special. Very very tasty!!! 
Everything about is awesome only I would have wished for more meat on my sandwich. 
Can't wait to try the all the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm! This place has it all.. a convenient drive-thru, friendly staff, and amazing food. Decent price for the quality and quantity of food. Does take some time to prepare, so be patient. But totally worth the wait, since it's so fresh. Pizza fries are... unique?!? I recommend trying them at least once. We've only gotten the Philly steaks, not the chicken, but I can say the steak is on point. I give it the pregnant woman stamp of approval!"}
{"text":"Some good tasting cheesesteaks. I'm a philly native so nothing in the cheesesteak category gets 5 stars except my south philly spot, so keep that in mind. I got mine provolone with, and it came out great. Greasy, filling, delicious. Drive thru was as quick as fresh cooked can be, so top marks there.

Service, good. Food, good. Price, good ($8-10 per depending on your preference). I will be a returning customer as soon as my arteries recover from my last visit!"}
{"text":"Looking for a quick bite to eat driving through Henderson. Found this place on yelp. Reviews are spot on. Cheese steak came out quick, tasted fresh with soft bread and a good flavor. Don't hesitate to give this place a try."}
{"text":"I'm from South Philadelphia and these are the only cheesesteaks I've found since I've lived in Henderson that can compare to Pat's or Geno's. Great job guys, keep it going and I'll be in at least 2 times a week if not more. Loved this place and the employees are fantastic"}
{"text":"Great food! Reminded me definitely of back east. Good service. Not bad prices. Would of gave it 5 stars but the decor is a little boring. Tables are just kind of scattered. Was clean tho so I'm the end that's what matters."}
{"text":"Had the Philly with cheese and grilled onions and it was made to perfection. I the Pizza cheese steak as well. It was also really good. I will be coming back and bringing my friends from the east coast here as well."}
{"text":"First two times ordering delivery, all was good. Then today, National Cheesesteak Day....was a disaster. Sandwich was low on meat, no ketchup, and the garlic parmesian fries were soggy, undercooked, and useless. $20 for a meal I had to throw away.

That will be the last time I order from here.

Edit: contacted by owner and meal was credited."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Michelle and Michael are super nice, and you can tell they both care about what they do. Michael got us refills even when we were sitting outside, which I was super stoked about. Food is delicious and they have great prices. I got the Cheese Whiz and it's apparently actually cheese whiz from the can. Surprisingly very good. We'll definitely be making this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"This place is nice and clean plus they are open til midnight. The philly sandwich is amazing. Would have been 5 stars but they forgot my ketchup."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place! 

I ordered the steak with mushrooms  delishhh my bf ordered the steak, mushrooms & peppers, he loved it!

The cheese fries are basic...

Service was great! Friendly staff and the location is clean."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I ordered delivery and it came very quickly. While the delivery price was over half the cost of the item I ordered, it well worth it."}
{"text":"Cheese whiz steak is it!!! This place is really good. Staff are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Philly.  I ordered 2 Philly CheeseSteaks with Provolone loaded for my wife and I.  I have to say it brought back memories of eating a Philly in Philly.  It was EXCELLENT.
If you want a real deal Philly you have to stop here.  The staff was awesome but the Philly 
out shined.  I will be stopping in as often as possible."}
{"text":"Best Philly cheesesteaks in Vegas! Staff is super friendly and helpful! Has a total family feel and the food is out of this world! Love the presentation too- newspaper print is so creative!"}
{"text":"I tried 2 sandwiches with grilled onions and mushrooms - one with white American Cheese hot peppers and another with whiz and sweet peppers.  Both were excellent.  I wasn't sure if I wanted whiz but ended up really liking it.  Bread was excellent could have used more mushrooms.  Will go back."}
