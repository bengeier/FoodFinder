{"text":"There are so many kinds and they all taste fresh! Really really love this oyster place! You can spend around 30 dollars to try up to 10 kinds! Best oysters in MTL ever! I prefer Kushi from BC!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this farmers market and was thoroughly impressed at the quality of food offerings. Not much seating on a busy Saturday but if good oysters, cheese, meats etc is what your looking for without stuffy vibes here ya go."}
{"text":"We were happy to be part of La Boite aux Huîtres's first ever edition of the \"Merci pour les Huîtres\" event (\"Thank you for the Oysters\" event) in collaboration with Virginia Seafood. Three kinds of oysters were part of the event:  J&W Seafood from Lower Bay Western Shore, Massawadox Salts from Upper Bay Eastern Shore and Sewansecott from Seaside. A little suggestion, the next time you will pass by the Jean-Talon market, come visit La Boite aux Huîtres and slurp some fresh delicious oysters! We promise you will fall in love all over again with the sea because we did!"}
{"text":"This is probably your go-to place in Montreal when you're out for oysters, unlike other you get to choose from their variety. Each one is labeled with their name, taste description (in French) and their origin. As a first-timer I was confused by so many options, therefore I asked for a selection plate.  I got three oysters from PEI and two from BC - the ones from PEI had a fresher and more characteristic taste, therefore when I visit next I think I will go for the ones that come from the Canadian Maritimes. The only thing about this place that schuks (pun intended) is that the employees charged me 2.50$ per oyster YET all the while I saw them deliberately pick oysters that cost 2.00$ THEY OVERCHARGED ME in the end. AAAAAAAAAAAHHHH. And yes, there is a variety of oysters that cost 2.50$. Long story short, always pick your own oysters. Also they sell sea urchins for 3.75 per one, whose contents you fork out after they cut it open for you. Also they have some jumbo oysters, personally I will go for those the next time I visit here."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to visit at Jean Talon. The oysters are as fresh as you can get and the homemade sauce pairs perfectly with them. I tried their classic tasting menu with west and east coast, American and European oysters. It was a great variety. Just an FYI, it does cost a little more if you decide to eat there instead of taking it to go. It's worth it though!"}
{"text":"Oh man. If you like oysters, this is IT! All super fresh.  Amazing variety.  Really made my trip.   Too bad they don't allow wine these days but it just allows you to focus on the flavors of the Canadian east coast."}
{"text":"Prices and location optimal. Nevertheless, in times of rush hour, it can be a lengthy wait. One of the guys mixed up our order but apologized by adding 2 oysters on our next order, nice gesture. Quality is irreprochable and variety quite large."}
{"text":"Walked in and immediately wanted oysters.  Shucked right away and the guy working was very knowledgable about what he was serving and gives out good recommendations!"}
{"text":"Fantastic OYSTER BAR the entrance of Marché Jean-Talon.   Prices are expensive, but the quality is VERY good. Do not expect happy hour prices. =P Ranges from $2-$3.50 / piece depending on the type of oyster you get. Dining \"in\" cost extra cuz they shuck it for you. To-go is a little cheaper, but unshucked.   They have combos, or you can pick whatever you like.  If you're unsure have them explain the oyster taste to you.    We got a mix of salty and creamy oysters. Sorry can't even begin to remember where they were all from ... all over the world... many I have never heard of like \"Phat Bastard' ... , but every single one tasted fresh and wasn't at all too salty. Wish we could've ordered every single one. =) Comes with a side of fresh horseradish and lemons on ice.    Worth a stop in the market... great for sitting around, eating oysters, and watching the life of the market. :) Oh and if you like hot canadian guys shucking your oysters, this is a must stop ... *looks at someone in particular*"}
{"text":"Great fresh ice cold oysters with a fantastic selection from West coast (not my thing) to East coast (my thing) and Europe too. Small counter... Worth the wait. They also have fresh uni if you're there early. Lots of toppings though they're so good it's a crime to mask their flavor so go light on whatever you top with. Procrastination held out until now as I was there on 5/25/14."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh oysters and lobsters! We ordered a combo of 12 oysters in four different types, spending 30$ in total. The guy served us was so kind and welcoming. He explained the taste of each oyster and the the differences as well. Ah and don't forget to try the lobsters! They're freshly steamed and so chewy but in a tender way! Definitely will dine there again!"}
{"text":"Cela fait 2 fois que j'yvais. La première fois c'était a la fin de l'hiver et je ne me souviens pas si ils proposaient un bar pour les manger sur place. Je les avais achetées a emporter, avec un bocal de vinaigre mariné aux framboises pour mettre dessus. Un vrai délice! Encore mieux au printemps, alors que je les ai dégustées sur place. Tu choisis celles que tu veux, et il y a vraiment beaucoup de choix, si tu sais pas quoi prendre tu decris si tu aimes les huîtres fermes, plutôt salées ou pas, grosses ou petites... et tu mentionnes combien tu en veux. Ils te les ouvrent sur place et te les serve sur un joli plateau avec des morceaux d'ananas et des sauces a mettre dessus si tu veux. J'ai essayé un vinaigre avec des échalotes et ce qui devait etre du piment fort et c'était somptueux. Je me suis assise au bar, a l'ombre, et j'ai profité de la belle météo, de la bonne humeur de tous. Les huîtres étaient delicieuses. Il faut compter 2.5- 3$ par huitre. C'est le même prix si tu emportes ou tu manges sur place, avec juste le pourboire pour les ouvreurs a rajouter. Quand tu les achètes a emporter ils te les emballent dans un sac avec plein de glace pilée. J'y retournerai lors de mes prochains stops au marché Jean Talon!"}
{"text":"I love oysters.  I do prefer east coast oysters but there's plenty to choose from!  I'd say they have at least 12-15 varieties from all over the world.  They have tasting platters, a dozen for $30.  So fresh and tasty!  On Tuesdays, you can get a dozen malpeques (pretty safe choice) for $12.  I come here whenever I visit!"}
{"text":"Glad we discovered this gem in the Jean Talon market. The only improvement would be if they were allowed to serve wine/beer."}
{"text":"Fresh oysters of different kinds. We had a 6 piece sampler then another dozen of the raspberry kind from PEI. If you find yourself in Jean Talon Market, do try this place out!"}
{"text":"Top notch oysters and friendly service. They turn a blind eye to brown bagged beers nd wines as well ;-) SHHhhhhhhhhhh..."}
{"text":"La meilleure place pour les huitres à Montréal. Un must"}
{"text":"We got a plate of oysters while waiting for the rest of the family to finish shopping. We got the Explorateur -12 oysters (4 different types) from Europe, East Coast, West Coast, and America. Super fresh oysters, shelled right in front of you. The selection is amazing. Theres also lemon, their own infused vinegar mixture, and all types of tobasco. My favorite were the Kelly Oysters from Ireland. So large and deep, and very creamy milky texture. I'd come here again and just get those!"}
{"text":"I don't know what to think.  I had 2 items. One oyster and a sea urchin.  The Urchin was bad. There where flies thriving on them.   But the oyster, a giant blue Angel, was amazing. I was blown away on how a \"steak\" like this was in fact a slab of divinely salted butter.   So I don't know where to sit. Because a part of me is disappointed to see that they are ready to serve item that are borderline..."}
{"text":"Early Friday evening I decided to come shopping for the best turkey around and decided that before I go pick it up that I might as well have some oysters since they were looking mighty tasty.  Grabbed a dozen of the black pearls and sat at the bar, it was beautiful out the sun was shinning down, heavy flow of people chatting walking through market, loads of people stopping checking out the oysters. The best was the second batch of oysters I did the rocky shore and they were delicious, not as sweet as the first.  The younger worker I had was very polite and super knowledgable about the oysters and the ones he recommend I liked. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I was touring around Montreal, hit up the market and found this little gem of an oyster bar. There were so many different varieties that I was glad our server just recommended the $1/oyster Tuesday special they had. It was my lucky day! Not sure what type or from where it was harvested. I just know that it was fresh, briny, delicious, and tasted like the sea."}
{"text":"The first time we went to La Boîte Aux Huîtres was also the first time we ever tasted oysters. I was excited to finally try what I had seen on so many menus, tables, movies and videos. I remembered book passages where a character would taste oysters for the first time. I hope that I would like it. My boyfriend didn't know what to expect, and was mildly worried about eating the raw, living flesh. Would he gag? He didn't want to feel embarassed. We sat down at the counter, and explained that it was our first time. The waiter kindly suggested a few milder, sweeter varieties of oysters. We went for the Shigoku oyster, described as having a clean, fresh taste. We each had one.  We lifted the little shells to our lips, looked at each other and slurped. The shell felt rough and cold, and the oyster was slippery and plump. I first tasted the brine - slightly bitter, like the sea. Then I tasted the sweet, tender flesh, and marveled at how a simple organism like that could offer such a symphony of flavors.   We understood why people like oysters."}
{"text":"Good service, very friendly staff. Oysters are delicious. I'd give a 5 star of they had more sauces or garnishing given other than lemon and tobasco sauce. But it's very yummy nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Oysters of many varieties, shucked before your eyes, and presented in an adorable wooden box. They have both sweet or saltier ones, I like both so I had 2 sweet and 1 salty, while my companion had 3 salty ones. We agreed that all were delicious and perfectly fresh. On the side is some grated horseradish and lemon slices. You can also add tabasco sauce or malt vinegar. What else could you want? A nice snack, and great to enjoy with a bottle of cider purchased in the next stall."}
{"text":"A great way to start your morning at the Jean Talon Market.  They're just at the entrance as you walk you.  Sit down on a small counter, pick out your oysters, have them shuck it, and serve it on a small box.  Go early before it gets too busy."}
{"text":"Honestly, I've tried oysters in restaurants before and I've never been a fan as I thought they were slimy, icky and had no taste.  I know they are supposed to pair well with wine but I am not a huge drinker.  Anyways, once I saw this place at Jean-Talon and tasted a couple, I fell in love.  This place had at least 50 different types that were from the US, Canada or overseas.  I think I had a total of 9 oysters and each one had a distinct flavour.  Regardless, they were all delicious and the people were really nice.  Shucked on the spot for you.  If you go to Jean-Talon in Montreal, this little oyster stop is a must.  I will be back here next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 platters of different oysters from their huge selection. The y could not have been better. Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 5 oysters from the guy with a bowl cut at 1:27pm  He calls #25 and we are #24  At 2pm I go up to him and say \"Sorry Sur but we've been waiting over 30 minutes\"  He rudely says back... no you haven't been waiting over 30 minutes and actually scoffed and us.   I showed him my receipt and he has the audacity to say you're #24 you need to be patient wtf?!?!?   No I'm sorry you've actually been waiting 33 minutes or sorry I just spent the last 5 minutes knocking oysters around instead of filling your order....   Rude cocky idiot trying to wink at these two girls while not doing his job.   Great...great... if he's the owner I hope he doesn't make it."}
{"text":"Read so many reviews about this place so I went to the market just to have some oysters. I got a 6 mix which was $16. The guy gave me oysters from PEI, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. I'm not big on oysters so it was hard for me to really differentiate the taste of it from one another. I did like the small ones though because it tasted more delicious to me."}
{"text":"Man...if I won the lottery one of the first things I would do is come here and clean them out of their FRESH, plump, juicy, meaty oysters!!!   I can't help going here first whenever I go to the Jean Talon Market. Varieties frequently change, and they are always high quality.   The best part for me is the sheer variety! I haven't even tried the fried goodies like calamari here because I LOVE their oysters so much!"}
{"text":"Any visit to Jean-Talon would be incomplete without stopping at this oyster palace. For 30 cad you get a dozen oysters in a variety of combos. Delicious and their sauces are great additions."}
{"text":"Really delicious, great selection and fantastic service. Oysters are served shucked in a little wooden box full of ice. A delightful little stop at the Jean Talon Market. Super fresh oysters and affordable at an average cost of $2 - $2.50 per oyster."}
{"text":"Alright, I love oysters, I love open air markets and I love the chance to eat oysters at an open air market!  This afternoon while at Marche Jean-Talon we happened upon this small raw bar loaded with a ton of oysters. After walking past this kiosk a few times, my tummy got the best of me and I tried a few of their oysters. Let me tell you, I was not dissapointed.  The oysters were the best that I have had in a while and they had such a great variety of types that it was difficult to choose. The man shucking the oysters was really welcoming and made it a point to have a conversation with us. At the end of it all, the only dissapointing factor was that my bank account doesn't allot me the oportunity to eat all the oysters my stomach would allow!  Moral of the story, if you like raw bars, don't miss this one!"}
{"text":"A trip to the market just doesn't seem complete without a stop at this popular market stall. They have a large selection of fresh oysters on display, and you can easily find something you would like. We got a dozen oysters ($30) to share as a group, and we were even able to choose several different kinds to compare and contrast.  They shave fresh horse-radish, give you a couple wedges of lemons and a beautiful tin plate full of freshly shucked oysters to devour. There are bar seats along the stall and off to the side to slurp down the little sea-salty morsels. A great way to start a day at the market!"}
{"text":"We were in the area enjoying a number or local treats and saw the friendly face of Greg inviting us for oysters and couldn't resist. My boyfriend will never eat more than one and he ended up loving the 3 he tried and wanting more. The service was top notch and the recommendations he offered help us select the oysters that would be most enjoyable to us. He was even spot on with his suggestions for which mignonettes to use for each. I only wish that this place was closer to home so we could enjoy it more often."}
{"text":"Nestled in the corner of the Jean-Talon market La Boître aux Huîtres has great oysters and seafood. Typically have a daily special on their oysters like 12 for $12. Oysters were fresh and clean and the vinegar was very tasty. The staff is friendly and I would definitely go back for more oysters."}
{"text":"Oysters are delicious and inexpensive. Great value. Though you'll probably eat your oysters standing up while cuddling a sweaty stranger next to you, the experience is not compromised! I'm definitely an oysters fan, and rather seasoned in trying oysters from different spots. The oysters here were better than a lot of New York upscale seafood joints."}
{"text":"Stopped by while roaming the aisles of Marche Jean-Talon and couldn't resist trying some fresh shucked oysters from PEI (Prince Edward Island) and other local farms.  Ordered a half dozen, shuckers choice, and they shuck them right in front, pack it on ice and mignionette and other condiments are in bottles on the counter. I'm giving 3-stars because they weren't as organized and somehow our order got lost between the cashier and the shucker so they skipped over us and then started bickering between themselves about why it's so disorganized.  The oysters themselves were super fresh and cold and I wish I could have had a few dozen more."}
{"text":"This is Montreals best oyster joint! They have so many varieties of oysters to choose from- each is from different parts of Canada. What's even more amazing is on Tuesdays they have shuck for buck so oysters are $1 each! However you can only order 2 dozen per transaction. But credit cards are $25 minimum so you would need to add another regular oyster. Their spicy home made sauce to go with the oysters is heavenly! Just go you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A fabulous place to try some fresh local oysters to eat in my case for breakfast before exploring this vast market.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm back and this oyster stand is still so wonderful as the last time I visited. Actually this is the first time I'm in Jean Talon market and didn't even bother strolling around, being at La Boite aux Huitres turned to be completely satisfying experience.  I'm not sure if the place has grown more popular or it was just a busy day, oyster hungry customers kept coming. At first we were a little bit deceived by the small chaos surrounding the stand (one can call it bar as you actually can sit around it), but once the bottle of white crispy wine was in front of us and oysters ordered everything was perfect. No need to go to SAQ anymore, there is a stand of local Quebec winery just next to La Boite, they will supply bottle of wine or cider with their tasting glasses making the experience classy. We had a dozen of oysters for 30 dollars, good deal for the quality and another six, including the gigantic ones from my picture that were buttery and you have no choice but eat them in two bites. People were having good time around and we did too .... number 99 never appeared to claim his oysters, regardless of the persistent calls of the personnel, I hope somebody else ate them.....  So where would you like to be on a hot summer day in Montreal? For sure at La Boite aux Huitres slurping Canadian oysters and drinking Quebec wine!"}
{"text":"This place would be an easy 4-star review, but because they let you bring a bottle of wine (from the SAQ just a few meters down the road), I had to make it 5. Let all other business owners on Yelp take note: Booze = Stars. The more you have, the better They have a great selection of oysters. From huge ones from the NE United States, to small (but tasty!) Japanese ones. You can easily get a selection by the dozen, and it's by far the best way to try out what's on offer.  We had grabbed a bottle of white wine down the road, and we were able to sit at the bar and drink it with the oysters. When it comes to oysters, that's all I really need to have with them.  It isn't cheap, but we're talking oysters here. For what they're serving, the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Man, I'm a big fan of this place. Fresh oysters to order! Order however many you want, sit down, and someone will be shucking them right in front of you!  There's a huge selection and I, usually one to just randomly pick whatever oysters to enjoy, was able to get some more info from the lady at the cashier. I ended up getting an order of 6 different oysters for at total of ~$13.   I think that the guy who shucks the oysters usually tells you which one each oyster is when he hands them to you but he didn't do so for me. It's ok, because I mostly had my eye on the \"Phat Bastard\", a huuuuge oyster. The sign makes it sound like it's an oyster by \"Donalde Trumpe\". Do they mean Donald Trump? Or a caricature or him? Either way, it kind of fits. All of the oysters were fantastic and I wish I could come here often.   5/5."}
{"text":"Have been here a dozen times. Always have a dozen of oyster and share with my friend. When the time is right, I also have sea urchin.  Never have I been disappointed. I like it with several choices of sauces. I even bought a Jalapeno sauce from the stand.  Last time I was there I had a dozen oysters of a mix of 5 kinds from different areas west, east shores and Europe. Just ask for The Explorer which was 30$ plus tax."}
{"text":"I went here with my sister on our visit to the Jean Telon marketplace. The first time we passed it on a separate occasion we noticed it was very packed.  La Boîte offers so many varieties of raw oysters to choose from that are sourced from various locations around the world. Each type of oyster has a sign with its unique name and small description of what taste it has. Once you've decided what oysters you want, you order at the cashier, they give a number to wait to be called when your order is ready. There is counter seating and bench table in the area to eat your oysters. The oysters are beautifully displayed on a bed of ice and given with slices of lemon and mignonette, of needed. I personally like to slurp the oysters without any topping to get a good gauge of the tastes of the oysters. My favorites were the kusshi and french kiss oysters which both had a sweet finish. I would definitely go back to try some more!"}
{"text":"The oysters were fresh and delicious.  My only problem here was the sauce in the jars that's meant to be shared - all good, that was until I saw someone put their nose to the open jar to smell the sauce.  It made me wonder how many guests come by and sniff the sauce before that person.  I asked for sauce on the side from a fresh batch - one of the guys said no.  Ok..."}
{"text":"The variety offered by this oyster bar is insane. I love the ambiance of just sitting in the marché Jean-Talon and enjoying a beautiful day outside while slurping fresh oysters. They shack it in front of you and the people who work there give great suggestions. I personally love the creamy ones, so do ask the people behind the counter if lacking inspiration for what to choose."}
{"text":"If you like oyster a lot these folks have a lot of oysters to sell. There are at least 10 different types all of which can be sampled for a small price before you buy. They are located at the North side entrance so you really can't miss it if you are on the prowl for some wonderful bi-valves."}
{"text":"During my last Weekend in Montreal, I was at La Boite Aux Huitres slurping oysters TWICE.   I guess I must love them enough to make a repeat visit.  But what's not to love. Fresh Fresh Oysters and with varieties!! Skillfully shucked and beautifully presented. First time we ordered 4 dozen.   Then we back on Tuesday again for their $1 a shuck. $1 oysters another couple of dozen please.   Located at Jean Talon Market, you just cannot miss that."}
{"text":"I like that we can try oysters from different countries. We ordered 12 oysters from 4 different locations for $30: Oyster from Duxbury, MA, USA, Ireland, PEI, and Nova Scotia. The Ireland ones are very big and meaty. The Duxbury and Nova Scotia ones are smaller but sweet. They also offer oysters from other locations too."}
{"text":"Fresh, Friendly, and great knowledge of all kinds of seafood!  Great interaction with customers.  Found out we were visiting from NY and played some Sinatra for us!!!  So delish!!!  Come Tuesday for 1.00 Oysters !!! Loved the blackBerry, and the gooseberry!!  Try them all!!!  Maybe if your lucky enough Greg McGiver will feed you & entertain you too!!!   Big shout out to Greg!!!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for lunch with my neighbour because every other restaurant didnt serve oysters at lunch time. The variety of oysters is good and the girl who served us made sure we taste the best types they had. I highly recommend the Pink Moon oysters from P.E.I. -they were my favorite!  Most are between 2$ and 2.50$ a unit. Definitely worth a try if you are at Marché Jean-Talon!"}
{"text":"This neat little oyster bar is tucked away in the back corner of the Jean Talon market. Deffffffinitely a must if you're in the area. The oysters here are so so fresh and the workers are knowledgeable about how the oysters taste.   We asked for a recommendation of 3 oysters on the sweeter side and they recommended the French Kiss, and two other ones that I don't recall.   SO. DELICIOUS. Definitely don't forget to add the olive pomade sauce and raspberry wine-like vinegarette. The oysters were amazing and did not have any fishy taste at all."}
{"text":"This place is freaking amaaaaazing: oysters of all shapes, sizes and saltiness from east to west coasts. Your bounty is served up in a cute wooden box all shucked and pretty for you. The conversations and the people that you meet at the counter are always top notch and best of all? It's BYOB...nothing goes better with oysters than a nice white wine or a delicious bottle of champagne (the SAQ is literally 15 steps away, so you have absolutely NO excuse!) My only complaint is that the market hours aren't longer in the summer, so I cannot make this my dinner spot as the market closes at 18H on some week days: Boooo!  ***UPDATE: we wanted to have my birthday dinner here but the market closes at 6pm. The owner had some oysters put aside for me as a consolation...umm hello, best business ever! I am your most loyal fan La Boite aux Huitres! Bisous"}
{"text":"We read so many glowing reviews about this stand in the Marche Jean Talon that we knew we had to stop by for a bracing oyster breakfast (that's how you start your day off right on a Montreal vacation).   When you arrive at this no-frills corner booth, you'll find a dizzying variety of oysters to choose from. Helpfully, they all have flavor descriptors so you'll know what you're getting into. The French Kiss seem to be very popular, so we picked a few of those along with several other varieties. After staking out two adjacent seats at the bar, our oysters were shucked, plated, and delivered to us within minutes. And, they were a simple, delicious treat. Every one we slurped down was excellent, and it was a great momentary sojourn in our stroll through the market."}
{"text":"While strolling through Jean Talon on a spectacular sunny day, we decided to stop and try this cute little oyster counter we saw the other day, located on the north-eastern s corner of the market.  It's a simple bar, with a couple of guys shucking oysters, we did not want to do full on so we just tried a quicky of 8 x 1$ special of the day oysters.  They are served on ice in a cute little box, all the fixins like hot sauce, malt vinegar, and of course lemon are available and it is very friendly.  In the short time we were there we saw many regulars show up and chat it up with the staff, you can tell they get lots of repeats and so they should.  The hubby asked if this was a byob, and sure enough they said yes! So if your in the hood, and want to try something different then your all set.  Eating oysters in the market, can beat it.  They have a good size selection and the prices seemed more than fair, I do believe they sell to go so it's a great way to sample before you buy."}
