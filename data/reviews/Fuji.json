{"text":"Went to restaurant with 3 coworkers and found a cute little place that wasn't too busy. Now I know why...
We ordered 3 meals off the regular menu and 4 sushi rolls. They took an hour and a half to bring the menu items, forgot the salads, and 2hours to bring the sushi rolls. All the waiter kept doing was giggling \"sorry\" like a bad Seinfeld episode. 
Food was mediocre and don't even attempt the green tea ice cream... It tasted like Brut cologne with a slimy outer shell. 
I have eaten at a lot of sushi restaurants and I can guarantee I will not return here."}
{"text":"Ordered a meal with no mushrooms Togo.  When I got home there was mushrooms in it.  Called back and told them and the lady argued with me...Complete waste of money.  Will never return."}
{"text":"We were in the Concord area and decided to give this another try. The decor is neat with bamboo and paper lamps hanging, lighting is covered wit colored cloth on the ceiling. No issues with the owner this time and the waitress was wonderful. The rolls are buy one get the second free (at a lesser value) and they were fresh and good. We ordered the Nemo, Volcano, Canada and Crazy rolls. The rolls are smaller than most places but the value was there. Overall we would rate this place as average, there are better around...."}
{"text":"This is right up there with nakatos and kabutos. This was our second time eating there and even the sushi was good. Maybe even a little cheaper than nakatos and kabutos but don't get too excited bc I mean just by a dollar or two lol. Oh and we got free saki shots from our chef at the hibachi grill."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. This is my daughter's favorite sushi restaurant. They always have great customer service and the sushi itself is fantastic."}
{"text":"Fuji is a great place for Sushi, and I go here often for dinner. Staff is friendly, and they typically have a special on the sushi rolls. Our kids typically order some hibachi to go along with the sushi. 

I see a lot of comments about it not being a \"Date atmosphere\", and I would agree. But i would also say your date should be more into the quality of the food and YOU than the atmosphere. 

Fuji is one of our little hidden gems that we visit frequently!"}
{"text":"Buy one get one sushi roll special is great for sushi lovers, but you have to purchase 2 drinks to get the sushi deal.  Fuji is never terribly busy, so food and service is usually prompt.  Most of the restaurant is taken up by the new sushi bar/conveyor belt.  Decor is simple, with nothing really pleasing to the eye.  Not a place for a date or to take someone special.  Ideal for quick less-intimate business lunches.  Lunch prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Town and anywhere else around! I stand by that 100%. Everything is great, haven't had a single thing that was bad. When we go here, we go big, $300 worth of sushi easy. It's not expensive, just so good you will keep ordering more, no reason for drugs when sushi this good is in town, you will feel high....it's that good!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi. Probably the best in Concord but not the best atmosphere.  There's no music. Just a TV for the staff and the chef to watch a cheesy cop show."}
{"text":"Fuji is hidden back in a small strip mall in Concord.  There were probably only three tables filled when I was there during lunch hour.  Hint.....hint.

The decor is odd to say the least.  I should have taken a picture of it.  The food is below average for Sushi, and Teriyaki and Hibachi dishes.  From the reviews, this place has its fans.  I can respect the fandom but there is no way this place is a 4 or 5 star."}
{"text":"Thinking the bad reviewer just had a bad meal-we love this place.  I think it's the best area spot for sushi.  For the money it's great, we enjoy the atmosphere and love the food and it's where we go on date night given the option."}
{"text":"Best sushi you will find in Concord. Pretty much the bomb dot com. Comparable to sushi 101, and they have buy one get one half off."}
{"text":"This was my second time going here.
Group of 4 went into Fuji literally 5 minutes before they closed... and they still seated us thankfully!
we were the only people in the place and we had a lovely waitress who brought our drinks and appetizers out quickly. unfortunately because it was so late they had put away a lot of stuff, but they could still do any sushi rolls we wanted (which is all I personally cared about ) : ) 
They have a good ginger salad and their miso soup has mushrooms.
We orded 8 sushi rolls and they were all really tasty!
The rolls are buy one get one free with a drink purchase.

The only thing I don't care for about Fuji is the decor... You can tell they were on a budget when they selected everything but I give them credit for trying to have a cool decor theme."}
{"text":"Good sushi, better than a lot of places in Charlotte. Two rolls for the price of one. Although, small/medium sized rolls are on average $9.50. That's how they keep the two for one roll special. Nonetheless, I'll be back!"}
