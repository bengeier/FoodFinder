You have to try the perogies and the Hungarian French Toast if you're there for lunch."}
{"text":"I loved the meatball dish. Home made food  made with love and care. I could taste the fresh ingredients. I recommend the place."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing little gem... So authentic and super friendly.  Genuine Romaian owners making the best food ever.

So worth the drive.. a must !"}
{"text":"Food was good, service lovely, decor a bit trashy. The waitress was a lovely friendly girl wearing yoga pants. The resto is a bit messy with an old cook area in the dining room piled with stuff. They do make an attempt though, love that they decorated the tables and put out fresh flowers. I might get food to go next time. But I can cook as good as this. Meh"}
{"text":"Used this place as an excuse to take a leisurely drive out of Toronto and we were so glad we did. We told the wonderful server we were hungry even though it was only 3 pm, and she expertly recommended that we (2) split a goulash and a highpoint platter.  Everything was nuanced and delish--couldn't recommend a better path to comfort food bliss. Plan time for a post-prandial nap when you get home,  though."}
{"text":"Went to Highpoint restaurant today with my wife, parents and two children (2 years & 4 months) and had a great time. 

The food was fast and fresh and the hostess was as European as they come. What a great experience. 

My mother had the French Hungarian toast and it was dinner sized portions from the breakfast menu (came out as a sandwich with fruit bowl for \"desert\")

My father and I ordered pork schnitzel and perogees and cabbage rolls to split with the table and they were great. Schnitzel was well seasoned, perogees came with LOTS of onion and red pepper as toppings and the cabbage rolls were the star of the plate!

My wife ordered the chicken quesadilla  and said it was very good as well. 

Before our meal even came out the great hostess came out with a bowl of potato and leak soup for my 2 year old. 

All 5 of us ate a very filling meal for roughly $50. 

Will certainly go back!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch on the way back to Toronto.   Wow - this is a great little spot - we had perogies and a greek salad and both were spectacular.  
The greek salad wad huge with great veggies - the kind that actually taste like veggies as opposed to cardboard - and the dressing was nice and light and flavorfull.   The perogies were just perfect - home made, great ingrediets- yummy.  I definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"On a long drive up north we stopped here for a quick dinner.   I am so glad that we stopped here to eat rather than go to a fast food joint!!! The meal was prepared with love and it was delicious.  We had pierogi and goulash,  as well as a lovely salad.  The restaurant was surprisingly empty for a Friday night dinner hour.  The hostess and server was lovely and ensure that we had everything we needed.  I do plan on stopping here again the next time that we drive up Highway 10"}
{"text":"European comfort food. The schnitzel and perogies are delicious!! Just south of Orangeville on Highway 10"}
{"text":"Orangeville bound and need a place to eat, that's not bacon, eggs, or a burger?  Well, definitely make a stop at Highpoint, located right on Hwy 10, a.k.a. Hurontario for all your 'burbanites.

I had a bunch of places written down and really didn't feel like 'white food', so I stopped here instead and had no regrets.  My bf and I were the only ones in the restaurant, but it wasn't awkward in the slightest.  At no time did I hear that theme song from \"Deliverance\" playing in my head...

I believe we arrived at after 2pm and we were still provided with the Lunch Menu, score!  Menu items included pierogies, crepes, schnitzels, and other EE eats, and yes, goulash ($14.99 - at that price, I hope it's a HUGE shareable bowl) was also on the menu...as a dinner item.  I was soo hungry, so I ordered a Cauliflower/Potato soup (shareable!) + the Denis Platter which came with 3 mini-ish cabbage rolls that were the length of 3 half-hotdogs + 5-6 pierogies.  Sorry, I couldn't think of anything else, appropriate, to describe the size of them!

My only complaint is that stuffing of cabbage rolls and the sauteed onions that came on top of the pierogies were too salted.  That's about it.  Otherwise, great taste, prices were not bad considering portion sizes, and better than the typical food that you'd expect on the way up North."}
{"text":"If you are in the area and do not stop to eat here you are missing out on an amazing gem! It was a national holiday in Canada and I expected to see nothing but fast food places open. Then I saw this little place and decided to stop. I am so glad I did! Not only is the staff friendly the food is fresh and amazing! I can only imagine that if I was in Romania and wanted Transylvanian traditional dishes they would be just like this. Look at the pictures and decide for yourself... You will leave happy!"}

{"text":"The location of restaurant is far from anything, if it wasn't the great review from Yelp, I would probably never find out. It is nicely decorated inside. As we got there at lunch time, it was very  empty except 2 customers came for takeout.  We ordered the lunch special, pork schnizel and chicken schnizel with potatoes. The pork was better than the chicken as the chicken was a bit thick. Potatoes were a bit overlooked. We also ordered the cauliflower soup but found it was not so warm. Overall, it was good experience, but I 've had better schnizel somewhere else."}
