{"text":"Il y avait un restaurant de burritos un peu plus bas sur cette rue mais il a fermé il y a quelques mois au grand désarroi de plusieurs de mes collègues et moi-même. Depuis ce temps, nous cherchions un remplaçant avec le même désespoir qu'un douchebag cherche une \" date \" dans un bar à 2:30 du matin.   Nous croyions - espérions - avoir trouvé avec M4, mais malheureusement, ce n'est pas le cas. Entendons-nous, les burritos n'y sont pas mauvais, mais il manque le petit \" houmpf \" supplémentaire, un goût et une saveur qui vous poussent à tout laisser tomber et à vous consacrer corps et âme à votre passion brûlante pour les burritos.   Dans ce cas-ci, ma réaction était plutôt que c'est correct et ça peut être pas trop mal de temps à autre, mais puisque la barre était haute en raison de mon expérience passée avec un restaurant sensationnel, je suis un peu déçu de ne pas ressentir la même émotion en pensant à M4. Bref, nous nous en tiendrons à des repas occasionnels, satisfaisants mais sans plus."}
{"text":"This was a disappointing experience. I had the beef burrito. The burrito is essentially 90% filler of rice, beans, vegetables (extra cost), and salsas. I feel stuffed and regret this lunch in a profound way. They are desperately trying to cut costs and it shows. The salsas were average. I was very disappointed by the fact that the burrito was soggy and stuck to the tinfoil in which they served it.   In my mind, I can picture a burrito packed with delicious meat along with rice and beans to accompany it. No such luck here. You really get the impression that you are eating an imitation of a food rather than the real deal. That's what these franchises are often all about. Upselling you on toppings and profit margins at the expense of a decent lunch. Do yourself a favour and find the real deal elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have seen the M4 near Concordia and have always wanted to try it, so I was thrilled to see another one open so close to McGill. Maybe my expectation was too high but I was disappointed.  You mainly have the choice between a burrito, a bowl, tacos, or tortillas. The bowl is a dollar more, but looks pretty much the same. My friends took the bowl and I took the burrito. The difference in the amount of each ingredient was huge. The bowl probably had twice as much rice, probably because it is harder to close a burrito too full, but still. I had the pulled pork one. The amount of meat was not that impressive, but the meat was decently tasty. There were four choices of salsa, none of which were nearly as spicy as I would have liked it to be.   The price is not that cheap either. A burrito and a bottle of Jarritos exceeded 10$. For the amount and quality of ingredients, it is not worth it. I'd give it 2.5/5, extra 0.5 for that Jarritos and for asking me whether I was a student without me mentioning it."}
{"text":"Very similar to Chipotle.  Staff was really nice but the food quality was lacking. Wilted lettuce. Dry meat. Overall a meal that filled our bellies and kept my 4 year old happy."}
{"text":"One word \"mediocre.\" This is not Mexican food especially in the flavor area!  They burned the quesadilla! It stuck to the panini-like grill. The food just didn't taste fresh or flavorful. I ordered a burrito wrap and the bowl version with the same contents. The beans were dry and pasty. The \"Mexican\" rice was bland. Limited filler options. Their idea of veggies are oily green peppers and onions. The tofu was spicy but not flavorful. The guacamole had blotches of brown. The only thing that was tasty was the pico de gallo. The food was cheap. The service was friendly and fast otherwise. Unless your desperate, look somewhere else for decent Mexican food."}
{"text":"New M4 burritos opened up near McGill!!!! Great environment, clean and crisp.  Staff was friendly and service was fast.  Food is everything you'd expect! I'm used to chipotle back in toronto so this is exactly what I needed. They're very similar, expect M4 prices are more varied in terms of the meats (carnitas, chicken, steak, barbacoas, etc) unfortunately, guacamole is still extra.  Also, if you're a student you get 10% off! I didn't even know but the cashier asked."}
{"text":"Grabbed food late night and was not impressed. Similar to chipotle in NY but less tasty."}
{"text":"As someone who enjoys a good burrito I was curious when I saw that a branch of M4 Burritos was opening downtown close to where I work.  In addition to burritos they also offer burrito bowls, and tacos.  It sometimes gets compared to Chipotle but having never tried that chain I can't comment on that.  It is pretty similar to Quesada, another burrito chain, which also happens to have a location a stone's throw away from this one.  Since burritos are the main focus of this place it made sense to get one so I got a pork burrito and added tortilla chips and and a drink to make it into a combo.  So how was the food?  Well as a whole I was left feeling underwhelmed with my meal.  The pork was dry and everything in general seemed to be quite bland.  I added spicy salsa to my burrito but it wasn't spicy at all.  Even the tortilla chips were stale and could have used some more salt.  The prices also could have been better.  If you just get a basic burrito it isn't so bad but if you start getting extras like guacamole then the price can start to climb pretty quickly.  They charge over $2 just for guacamole which is a tad steep given how other places don't charge so much for those kinds of extras.  My combo was $13 and I have to say that given the quality of the food I feel like it was overpriced.  If you're a student make sure you bring your student ID with you because you can show it for a 10 % discount.  With Quesada up the street on McGill campus I doubt I'll be back here.  The experience leaves a lot to be desired and I feel like I can get better value for my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was one of my favourite places to grab a bite to eat when I was in school. M4 is one of my go-to lunch and delivery spots, and never lets me down when I'm on one of my burrito bowl kicks.   There are a couple of locations in the city that I know of - both east and west. The restaurants seem to be relatively in order and clean, which is always a bonus. I personally love their burrito bowls. There are a ton of add-on options - both veggie and not - accommodating the majority of eaters and those with food restrictions. I personally always order a vegan bowl and I've never been disappointed. I've also heard good things about their burritos from friends (side note: there are always $5.00 burrito coupons flying around). The portions are massive and 100% worth the price. The service also tends to be quick and very friendly.   I recommend this establishment to anyone who is on the hunt for decent Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Good, I don't see anything wrong with this place. Yes they charge extra for everything but it all works out to a fair price. Their chorizo is delicious,  and the other ingredients are tasty. The place is very nice and fresh. Better than Quesada, which is garbage."}
