{"text":"They are charging delivery. What is that?.. I give $3 to 4 dollars tip to the driver but the owner also wants a share. Not enough money with the pizza I guess. The only way I pay him for delivery is to stop giving tips to the driver, but I wouldn't want to order a second time if I know the driver knows he is getting nothing."}
{"text":"Good Pizza, fair price. They made a mistake once and gave me wrong pizza, in less than 10 minutes new pizza was at my door and let me keep the one that came by mistake."}
{"text":"We've ordered from Villemont a few times now and while we've definitely enjoyed their pizzas we also sadly found that the quality of the toppings and particularly the sauce is better from one delivery to the next. Weird.

We've also had their poutine and it's pretty forgettable. The fries are pretty good though.

Delivery times are acceptable and the price tag pretty decent for what you get. When they are on point with solid pizza, it's a 4 stars, when not... well 2 stars. So let's rate it an average 3."}
