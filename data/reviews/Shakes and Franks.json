{"text":"I usually get the chili cheese dog and poutine, and my girlfriend gets the pulled pork. Their milkshakes are to die for, better than the 5 dollar milkshake in Pulp Fiction...I guarantee it. It has become one of our favourite spots in the Beaches, and I have a feeling these guys are here to stay. Family-run and the people working there seem to really enjoy the business, which speaks volumes to the quality of the \"fast food\" they produce. I put fast food in quotations because while the service is fast, this is gourmet dining at an affordable price. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had a chocolate milkshake one afternoon strolling through the Beaches. Changed my life. Now trying to decide whether to name my first born \"Shake\" or \"Frank\". Really pulling for a boy!"}
{"text":"The shakes here are absolutely amazing. To date, my favourite has to be the apple pie shake followed closely by the jittery cow. The Salted Caramel and Vanilla shakes can also make very nice summer time treats. When you stop by you'll likely discover some kind of seasonal shake on the menu (e.g. the Pumpkin shake in October) so the menu is always a little different from what is posted on their website.  In short, if you're in the beaches and want the best shakes you can get, come to Shakes and Franks!"}
{"text":"The service was positive and inviting, the atmosphere was clean and modern.  I tried the Mac Attack frank, which is a bacon wrapped frank covered in Mac and cheese.. An excellent combination!  My only criticism would be that the Mac have more cheese, as it was very dry."}
{"text":"Finally made it in. I had a footlong pulled pork and a poutine. The hotdog was great and the pulled pork exceeded my expectations. It was topped with a vinegar based slaw which paired great with the pork. The poutine was very good and turned out to be great value at $6.50. Large portion compared to the typical fast food joints.  Next time I'll try a shake."}
{"text":"I had a foot long dog and was quite excited. Price was pretty expensive for a hot dog with two topping but looked great. Made it through half and had to toss away the rest of the bun. Bun was stale and ruined it for me. Also found service was shitty. I stood there for 5 minutes and had to ask someone to help me. A bunch of teenagers who don't really care working there."}
{"text":"So yummy. I had the best apple pie milkshake and chili dog here. Its in a nice neighbour hood with a great atmosphere. Can't wait to go back and try a different kind of frank and shake."}
{"text":"I haven't had a chilli cheese dog this good since I lived in Michigan. So good yet so messy but hey  its to be expected and yes I got onions on top too. Don't Kiss me until the gum takes affect.  I got the apple pie milkshake so delicilous and filling . This hidden gem is worth the trek to the beaches so go asap !!!"}
{"text":"Come for hotdogs. Stay for the shakes! Seriously, try the Nutella shake. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place as the fare seemed pretty average to me. The shoestring fries were quite good, and the hot dog itself was extremely juicy as promised, but I will take $4 street meat over this any day. Being finished on the flattop, you just don't get that same flavour and crunch in the casing that you do on a BBQ. I had mac+cheese with tomato and onion. My wife had the Greek dog (I think it is called the Opa). Quality of the toppings was good. M+C was sub-par. The biggest disappointment was the bun. Pretty much the equivalent of a wonderbread untoasted white bun. With all those ingredients I would expect some more creativity and ingenuity (and flavour!) to go into the bun... At least toast the damn thing.   Overall disappointed based on other reviews and the high rating."}
