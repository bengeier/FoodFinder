{"text":"Good small town food, friendly staff, and atmosphere, gave 3 stars instead of 4 because they are super slow. Plan on waiting 30-45 minutes once you order your food.   Advice to owner: Find a way to expedite orders quicker. My wife and I ordered bacon and eggs w/ hash browns. That doesn't take 45 minutes to prepare on a semi-busy morning."}
{"text":"If your looking for  burned  bacon and under cooked potatoes this is your best bet for breakfast. Every seat was filled, not because we all loved the food but because the service was a tad slow. They get 3 stars."}
{"text":"Terrible the food is not good and the place takes 45 minutes to an hour to get the food to you and they love to burn things. I would not come here again. The place is awful."}
