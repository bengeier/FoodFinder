{"text":"I love you Hidden Harbor! Scrumptious Gluten free options, drinks are delicious and generous serving of actual alcohol, speedy and kind service!"}
{"text":"Overall, a pretty fun experience. I loved the fun tiki decor, and the contemporary seating arrangements with the coffee tables. The servers/bartenders were attentive, and knowledgeable. I had two gin drinks; one from the menu, and one bartender's creation. I really enjoyed both. My only hang up would be the tuna tacos, which I found to be really chewy for ahi tuna. Not sure if I just got a fatty piece, but they were not easy to eat, especially sitting at a coffee table. Unfortunately, I'll have to get my tuna tacos elsewhere. Overall, enjoyed the place, and would go back for drinks."}
{"text":"Drinks were terrific and I appreciated how well thought out the whole concept was. Even the menu was adorable. Happy hour is legit with a half price menu for some classic drinks but it's only 5-6.  Every drink I had was delicious."}
{"text":"It's very nice and different. Love the ambience. The drinks look great. Each one looks different. Wish they also tasted as good as they looked. Nice to have another place to lounge in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Fabulous Tiki drinks.  Be sure to check out Tiki Time Machine Tuesdays.  The food is good too!!!!"}
{"text":"Drink: 5/ 5 Service: 5 / 5 Atmosphere: 5 / 5 Price: 5 / 5  DRINK: I've been here 4 times solely for drinks, and let me tell you I love Hidden Harbor. I never order cocktails at top restaurants anymore because they simply don't compare to Hidden Harbor. Talk about true and ingenious mixology. Nothing gets better than high quality and natural-tasting ingredients. None of that over sweetened, fake sugar drunk BS.    SERVICE: The bartenders are so friendly and efficient  ATMOSPHERE: Love the Tiki decor  PRICE: So worth it for the quality of drinks you are getting. They are the same price as restaurant cocktails but exponentially better."}
{"text":"As a tiki fan, Hidden Harbor hits all the right spots. Their originals are delicious and unique, and their classics are always accurate. They have great events during the week, such as Weird Science Wednesday, where you get to try out some wacky concoctions such as chartreuse cotton candy or homemade dippin' dots. The decor is fun and inviting. For food, I love the nachos with the spicy steak, and the poke bowls are super yummy. Hidden Harbor ranks among the top tiki bars in the country for me in terms of drink quality and atmosphere, alongside greats like Three Dots and Dash, Lost Lake and the Mai Kai."}
{"text":"Checked this out yesterday.   Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and fun and very knowledgeable bar tenders.   I had never been to a proper tiki lounge before, but this one seems to hit the sweet spot of authentic without being over the top.   I recommend the Tokyo Drift with the veggie tacos or the 1934 Zombie if your bartender knows how to make it."}
{"text":"Finally, a true Tiki bar in Pittsburgh. I made it my mission in life to visit all of the Tiki bars in the States and I can confidently say that this may just be right up there with Lost Lake in Chicago, Porco in Cleveland, a little bit of Frankie's Tiki from Vegas and a bit of Tolteca from New Orleans.  I have one negative-it is too bright sitting at the bar! Dim those lights!  Now onto the good stuff-the staff is super friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. The drinks take time to prepare (which they should!) and are prepared with great ingredients. The Ishmael and Hidden Harbor drinks were spectacular. I loved the ice sphere in the Hidden Harbor drink and the color was beautiful! Almost too pretty to drink. The Ishmael had several complex flavors such as clove infused rum, fig and almond extract. Take a walk around the bar and seating areas-there are lots of great Tiki items to check out. Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"I'm not really into bars... And definitely not Hawaiian bars, but I absolutely love this place. Drinks are presented nicely, and it's very comfortable inside."}
{"text":"Tiki done right. Flavorful, delicious and thoughtful cocktails from one of Pittsburgh's best bartending teams, enhanced by an atmosphere of minimalist-kitsch. There's always something new to try. This will soon be widely rated as one of America's 10 best tiki bars.  One complaint: why does it have to be hidden? Wouldn't it be easier to find if it wasn't hidden? And what are they hiding?  Also, they don't have lemonade. WTF, people?"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in, and had a blast. We started out at the bar, and ended up on the wrap-around-the-room-bench. Great open space, lots of woods, and a good warm aura. There were indeed high craft drinks, great balance with those coastal fruits and rum. We simply could not try all the drinks, but the house tiki drink was my fav, especially the different edible garnishes. Holly's fav was the cream and egg white one, right? But I tried it, and it was good! I wonder if they will make me the Zombie, if I asked? (It really is a Tiki drink). Let's not forget those niblets. What was that ahi mini taco? Devine. Hey, da 'Burgh (Three River's City) has a real Tiki lounge now. Next time, I am thinking of taking over a booth with some friends, and tackling one of those group drinks, and trying more of their tapas."}
{"text":"Great tiki bar. Great service. Strong cocktails. I love this place. The strong drinks with fruit juice can be pricey so beware of that."}
{"text":"Say what?! A tiki bar in Squirrel Hill? While they don't have many traditional tiki drinks (Jet Pilot, Suffering Bastard, Zombie, etc) they have some GREAT interpretations like the Greenjacket which looks like a kale smoothie but is a radically awesome moijto. Big props for having a great tiki cocktail -- three dots and a dash -- and doing it so authentically.   Go, people! Support an amazing new bar like this. Pittsburgh needs them!"}
{"text":"An amazing ambiance with amazing drinks and amazing food. Do try the pu pu platter, gives you a great sampling of all they have to offer."}
{"text":"One of the top 10 tiki bars in the country and they're just getting started! The drinks are at the height of craft cocktails. Carefully thought out, perfectly executed, absolutely delicious. This isn't a tiki bar with sweet, syrupy drinks- the drinks are perfectly balanced and the finest ingredients are used. You can absolutely tell that the juices are fresh. The rum selection is very impressive and the bartenders and servers know how to recommend the perfect one. The food is perfect for sharing with friends and the whole experience takes you away to a different place. Escapism is really needed in a cold/ cloudy place like Pittsburgh. Don't expect to get a jack and coke here. Try something new and you will love it. Absolutely one of the best places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Such a unique spot! The South Asian inspired decor is done in a modern creative presentation. The drinks are wonderful in their taste and presentation. The vibe is fun and relaxed. We tried a few of the food items and found the skirt steak taco delightfully spicy. The pork sliders were served on a type of corn muffin and they were also delicious. The ahi tuna salad with chips was quite tasty but next time I will ask them to drizzle some soy and lime juice. While very fresh, it was a little bland.  We will return! Especially since they have a nice happy hour deal with drinks and some of the Apps half off."}
{"text":"Great drinks, especially on weird science Wednesdays. A lot of fun for dates or drinks with friends. I love the sweet, tropical cocktails. I wish there was more outdoors space in the summers, but location won't allow it."}
{"text":"I went to Hidden Harbor for a happy hour celebration with people from work. My coworkers were all stoked to be going to this bar, so of course the expectations for my experience were high. Luckily, Hidden Harbor met all of them! I first ordered the Leaf and Bean, which arrived with a HUGE ice cube and a charred piece of cinnamon that was still smoking. It looked like a tiki torch! After this drink, a few other coworkers ordered a bowl (name unknown) which was perfectly tart and chilled. The alcohol content in the drinks were quite high, which is always better than receiving a watered down drink. I then ordered the veggie tacos, which came quickly and had a unique Middle-Eastern-meets-Mexican flavor. Probably the harissa sauce and lentils created that flavor profile. I did have to ask for hot sauce, but that's only because I tend to enjoy a high spice level with my foods. If you like heat, definitely ask for the sriracha because it paired well with the other flavors going on in the tacos. That said, the wait staff was courteous, the atmosphere was dim-yet-inviting, which was perfect for our group, and the food/drinks were delectable!"}
{"text":"Eight or nine of us decided to come here for some after work drinks on a Wednesday.  We got there as soon as they opened so it wasn't too packed yet.  The cocktails are a bit on the pricey side with everything costing at least ten bucks.  But they're also all pretty strong - and worth it.  The Tropic Thunder was a great choice.  A couple people in our group got the Volcano, a drink that's meant to be shared.  If you  (or someone in your party) also gets it make sure to record it being served - it's a fun experience.  The food's also good.  We got a couple pu pu platters, and a few orders of the meatballs and the pineapple tacos.  I don't do pork or seafood (which is fairly limiting at a place like this) but the pineapple tacos were enough to make up for what I couldn't eat.  The falafel croutons are a bit of a weird idea, but they work pretty well in the tacos.  The tiki theme is a little kitsch, a little charming and very unique for Pittsburgh.  It permeates everything they do, from the decor (be sure to take a picture with the giant tiki statue in the back), to the food, and even the servingware (enjoy the glasses you get your drinks in!).  It's a nice touch and a nice little place in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"Finally able to make the trip from Erie to visit Hidden Harbor. It was everything I'd hoped for. Bartenders are extremely polite, efficient, and patient, and the cocktails they were creating were excellent. We tried a mix of their house cocktails and off menu classics, and we were pleased with each. The Gardenia Grog was surprisingly floral and pleasant. A complex drink they pull off very well. Their frozen drinks (Josie's & Blue Steel) have some very unique and pleasing flavors to them. To those complaining about the price of the drinks.... you don't know what you're talking about. From fresh juice, to house made syrups, to top shelf rums, to complex recipes (where if one ingredient is off the cocktail becomes an undrinkable mess) you're getting your money's worth. Try making any of these at home, and see how quickly you've spent over $100 on ingredients, assuming you can track down the proper rums in PA.  Didn't try any of the food, but what we saw looked tasty. Decor is modern with just enough of a retro tiki vibe. Music was in the background and suited the more more modern take of the bar. If there was any suggestion I'd make, it would be on future menus to explain a little better what's in the cocktails booze wise. The lady next to us was nursing a Curse of Pele for a while. She liked it, \"but it's strong\". She had no clue \"navy strength\" meant 114 proof rum, rather than the 80 proof she's probably used to in cocktails.  Looking forward to a return trip to here later this winter."}
{"text":"Went here for date night with my hunny a few Friday's ago. Upon arrival, the bar and the seated area was packed so the hostess took our name and said it would be about an hour for a seat, but if any area at the bar opened up, it was fair game. We decided to wait because we were already out, so why not? I could not wait to order a drink because everyone's drinks around us looked amazing, and the presentation was so unique! The hostess saw a couple at the bar getting ready to leave, so she walked over to us and said that if we stood over by the couple getting ready to leave, then we could take their spots. (This was after about only 15 minutes of waiting. I thought that was super sweet of her to do that!) we settled in at the bar and right away, a bartender named Sarah greeted us with a smile and some menu's. I decided on the Tokyo Drift. I apologize, but I can't remember what my boyfriend ordered. The bartenders are entertaining to watch while they are making drinks. Sarah made our drinks by where we were sitting so we were able to watch her make them the whole time. I thought that was pretty cool! Just at first sight, my drink looked so neat! It was served in a literal gold fish, and it has a half of a lime (hollowed out serving as a bowl) with passion fruit boba's. Besides my drink looking super cool, it also tasted amazing. It was a cold February day, but sipping on my drink made me feel like I was on a beach somewhere in the Caribbean. We only had time to stay for one drink, but I can't wait to go back and try some other cocktails! I highly recommend trying out Hidden Harbor when you have the chance!"}
{"text":"Expensive, but worth it!  The atmosphere is really cool and the drinks are so whimsical!  It's tempting to drink your way through the menu.  The cocktails are so very pretty and they taste as good as they look.  The menu is limited and a bit pricey for such small portions - but the taste is quite good and it's advisable to eat some protein as you work your way through the drinks.  The service is good, but sometimes a bit slow if things are busy.  Hidden Harbor is a great place for an office happy hour or a birthday celebration.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Drinks and food were great but service was SLOW! There was a party there but they seem to mostly be drinking so i have no idea why our food took so long. Great vegan options. The polka bowls are pretty filling and offer so many options. The drinks made the wait worth it, especially the one that came with a back scratcher!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, food and service in a fun atmosphere. Hidden Harbor is must-try unique experience in Pittsburgh.   When I first heard of Hidden Harbor I thought \"Why would someone open a tiki bar in Squirrel Hill?\" But my visits have shown it to be the perfect addition to the area.   The staff is fantastic. Friendly, knowledgeable and incredibly attentive. I love that everyone seems to really know the ins and outs of their menu and how their signature cocktails are made. Our waitress recommended the Tropical Itch and the Gardenia Grog - both of which were fantastic.  You might expect that a place like Hidden Harbor would concentrate only on drinks and let the food be so-so. But this isn't the case. Hidden Harbor has a fantastic small menu. We had the Shrimp Ceviche and the Plantain Canoa. The Ceviche was fresh, lite and satisfying. The Canoa was a delicious blend of meat and savory plantain. My only gripe was with the plantain chips for the Ceviche - I was hoping for something crispier, while these were somewhat soft.   Go here by yourself and sit at the bar or go with friends and share some of their multi-person drinks. Happy drinking!"}
{"text":"Don't take a reservation over the phone, then tell us there are no tables when we show up. We stood outside for 30 minutes after arriving on time for a reservation, only to be told after 30 minutes that no table would be available."}
{"text":"Fun, Lively and Themed.  Place: Tiki Bar!  It's cozy, yet big enough to have your own space & not feel crowed.  Atmosphere: Mixed for a Friday around happy hour( age-wise), seating is bar, high top tables, booths/bench, with a few other tables.   Drinks: HUGE rum variety, daiquiris/manhattan (can be created with any spirit), flights, mixed cocktails - in the cutest themed and decorated cups - well done.  Drinks $8-15.  Service: Server was friendly and helpful.   Snacks: Had the vegan and chicken taco  - slightly underwhelming - Nah. Not a dinner place.  Overall: I would return again for drinks and atmosphere - try some other Rums.  I love a place that provides an experience and felt this place did a pretty good job!"}
{"text":"Nice environment, really cool drinks, very tropicals. The appetizers were really good, the pulled pork burgers :) :) and If you like rum this is your kind of place!  Comeeee"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Hidden Harbor. I was able to sit outside with my date and take in fun vibe of squirrel hill. This was important to me because I work in an office all day and it's so nice to be outside.   We just ordered drinks and let me tell you, they are on the strong side! I ordered the Mai Thai (spelling?). It was quite delicious with the fresh lime wedge perched among the ice.   Our waiter was friendly and polite. He recommended various drinks on the menu as well, which I found super helpful.   I highly recommend hidden harbor if you're looking for a unique spot with strong beverages."}
{"text":"Went to Hidden Harbor with a big group of friends- we were able to sit in the large area with benches and coffee tables (the rest of the bar is filled with typical tables). It was a great area to be able to walk around, talk with everyone, and not be cramped. Drinks are on the expensive side (cheapest mixed drink is $10). However, this would be the first time that I would justify the price- they are very unique and each clearly takes time to put together. The food menu is limited, so I wouldn't recommend it as a dinner stop. It is a great place to stop for drinks after dinner though. Very chill atmosphere and nice decor."}
{"text":"This was a cool little spot! I got the Puerto Escondido, which was killer and the cup was a cactus so I love that. I would describe the atmosphere as cozy-chic, which is how I love to live my life. I didn't sample the food, but my friend got the nachos and they looked great. The prices were a little higher than your standard bar, but you're paying for the experience and I can respect that."}
{"text":"How about this 'hidden' gem! Please allow yourself the indulgence and pay this establishment a visit. Do it right, sit at the bar.   As simply as I can state, order a snack immediately with the drinks when you arrive. Pay no attention to any associates you may be spending time with, they should order a drink while deciding what their drink should be. Just the easy way to go out all the time. You'll thank me later for that advice.   We got two of the cocktails from their fine featured drinks, and they were fabulous. After having the Night Ripper, I may have been affected by the caffeine. Couldn't tell if they were strong, well crafted, or simply both. What they were was delicious, and suddenly I was verbose. So we pressed our luck (or to perhaps shut me up by filling my mouth with edibles) and ordered more food and drinks.   The second round of beverages were as solid as the first. Normally my critique would be that these drinks could use one or two fewer ingredients. I'm a KISS method kinda guy. But I will truly never know, and the drinks were, to say it directly again, delicious.   The food also tickled my pickle in all the right ways. As a sauce and fresh guy, I think more sauce and cilantro could be everywhere. But that's me, the food was awesome.   Overall. Give it a go. Perhaps come back again. This visit allowed me to try the long awaited food from a lady I've heard much about in this region. I think the quality of the crafting of food and drink is very well done here. But be warned, this isn't fast food, or a chain. It's much better than that.   Also the service was solid, nominal in every sense. Whether it was meant to be perfectly invisible is unknown to me, no matter. It was a great time.   And also HEY! Matches!"}
{"text":"We went to Hidden Harbor for my birthday which coincided with Hidden Harbor's birthday! So, we got half price drinks, WIN. I got a drink in a golden fish cup, but I can not remember the name of it. It was herbal and tea-like, it was amazing. They also served it with these little balls of passionfruit(?) that were delicious. I was also surprised that the food was really really good. I got the jackfruit ban mi (I am sure this is spelled wrong) which was really tasty, my husband had the meat version and said that he had had better. He really LOVED the meatballs. We both really enjoyed the nachos.   Overall everything is amazing."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks last night. One catch, I'm pregnant. Most places have no idea what to do when you ask them for a mock-cocktail menu but Hidden Harbor lets you have any of their cocktails without the booze. I tried the pain killer. It was really good and quite fancy looking. A lot of the people in my party had food and really liked it. The ambiance was great. Loved the tiki men everywhere. I thought the cocktails were a little pricey but honestly most places are that same price now - about 10-12$. Would come here again post baby."}
{"text":"Really cute small tiki bar located in Squirrel Hill. Drinks are yummy and served in the funnest glasses. Great decor. We had a party of 16 and the service was excellent! I wish the menu was better. There is limited options and what we did order was bland and scarce. Had the tuna ceviche and hardly any tuna or flavoring was in there. Ordered the salted cod dish and Again hardly any cod was in there but  the rice was good. I would just stick to ordering drinks and go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place had a very cute, nautical, beach theme to it! All the drinks on the happy hour menu were beach themed. I got the pain killer drink which was pretty strong but very tasty. There wasn't enough seating/tables when we went in though. It was a cute place to go to once!"}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I visited last Thursday. We braved the below freezing temperatures, and we ventured out to Squirrel Hill to visit Hidden Harbor.   The interior design, the drinks, and the atmosphere was inviting and well worth my first time at a tiki bar. The drinks were great (and very instagram-able). I had the Fassionola Fizz, which was not too sweet and a bit creamy - right up my alley. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Came in for a couple drunks and tacos on the way to Kennywood and was very inpressed! Very chill atmosphere, well decorated, and with lots of island vibes. Have both the chicken and steak taco's to split with my company - both were amazing! I stop in and check them out! Very professional staff, masterfully crafted drinks, and outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"Okay, I LOVE this place! I'm so happy they put a spot like this in the area - I feel like it's been a long time coming. The vibe is so fun! It's a great place to come with a group of friends or for a date night. There are a TON of drink selections, each with a beach theme. The drinks don't disappoint - neither does the atmosphere. I definitely recommend stopping in here if you get a chance!  We came on a Saturday night. It was busy, but luckily three seats were open at the bar the second we walked in."}
{"text":"Fun Tikki drinks! Not many of those in the burgh - enjoyed both the environment and the drink quality. Overall, I prefer this bar compared to the other tikki lounges in Southside. The atmosphere is good for couples or a few friends. It's not too loud.  The fun part of this place is their interesting decorations and the glasses they use to serve the drinks in. Check out their menu because they draw out the type of cup they use for each drink! I like picking a drink based on the cup/glass they serve you in!  The place also has a food menu, it's mostly hot food. I wanted a snack like chips or something but they didn't have it. If you are hungry though I think it would be a good place to get some late night. I was way too full from dinner to get any more food while there.   We will definitely be back another time to try different drinks and food!!!"}
{"text":"Tucked away on Shady just past the Forbes intersection, Hidden Harbor had been on my list to try for a while, so I suggested it to a gal pal for an otherwise uneventful Tuesday night. Its unassuming front opens up into several cozy seating areas, both small and large, with a hand-carved Tiki statue looming over the scene from the back. The cocktails are fun and imaginitive, with an extra Tuesday night bonus being their throwback menu, which features tiki drinks from the last 5-6 decades on a green \"passport\" card that you can get stamped. We stuck to the regular menu, me with the Zombie (a rum-based cocktail with plenty of fruit and a nice bite of pomegranate flavor without being too sweet) and my friend with the rum barrel. We lingered over our cocktails, which are pricey but not out of proportion to their quality. I would love to come back with a big group!"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm mainly giving Hidden Harbor three stars because they have almost no food and one vegetarian option. They also had an underwhelming happy hour menu. I have mixed feelings about rating them three, instead of four stars, because everything else about Hidden Harbor is AMAZING, but I had high expectations and was disappointed. I had been told that the food was really good, but I guess the menu is still being developed because they didn't have the items I had been told about. The boyfriend and I did end up splitting the seared tuna and the pineapple tacos. Both plates were amazing, but not \"entree-sized.\" They seemed to fit into the category of \"small plates.\" After we finished the food we had a small conversation about going somewhere else to get more food and drinks. Womp womp womp.   The drinks we had at Hidden Harbor were also AMAZING and had unique and interesting flavor combinations. We ordered a flight of Zombies and another cocktail. All of the drinks were beautiful and tasted as good as they looked.  The decor was really fun and the service was wonderful. Our server was good at her job and really nice.   Again, the reason for my three star review is because although everything about the place was great, but what they didn't have left having a conversation about trying to find more food. I really hate the idea of being so unsatisfied at one restaurant that I need to figure out where else to go for more food and maybe another drink. I fortunately had room for a gelati from Rita's and it was very satisfying. I'm not sure I'll be back again, unless I have absolutely no concerns about needing something to eat."}
{"text":"I ended up at Hidden Harbor after not being able to get a seat at the neighboring independent brewing company.  When I first walked in, I was a bit bummed to enter another seemingly cheap tiki bar knockoff establishment.  I looked over the menu of tropical, mostly rum drinks and ended up ordering a Manhattan because luckily they had a makers mark hidden in the back.  Score.  However, once my mango chicken tacos came, and I had spent a little more time in the place, I began to realize this wasn't your normal Caribbean tiki knockoff joint.  This is the real deal.  Their rum selection is legit, the food is worthy of me writing a superior yelp review, and the bartenders are excellent at helping you learn about different rums and cocktail recommendations.   Independent brewery is a great place, but if you're trying to switch it up, hidden harbor is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Really cool place! A little hard to find at first but once we did, we were happy! We came after a birthday dinner for some drinks! They seated our large group in the corner booth in the front. It was perfect for us all! The atmosphere is cool and inviting. The theme is well established around the place. We all ordered our drinks and they were fun! They come in different fun looking glasses with umbrellas and more! The crab nachos were really good. Good atmosphere for groups! We will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a weekday for a quick happy hour experience with my friends. Everywhere around the space there's tiki themed decorations, and I found myself just looking around a lot. This place definitely has their teal-colored tropical tiki style branding down. The space isn't large, and it was definitely filling up as Happy Hour came to a close. However there was plenty of seating at the beginning, so I would recommend coming in a little earlier if you can!  We were slightly hungry, so we ordered the nachos to start. With the curried meat add-on it was a generous portion that was the perfect size as a snack for the four of us, but could have been a meal for one. We also saw poke and tacos on the food menu, which I definitely want to try out sometime.  For happy hour, Hidden Harbor has a specific cocktails menu with half priced drinks. We probably tried at least half of the cocktails on it, and none of them disappointed! I appreciated how a lot of them had nice garnishes which made them visually appealing on top of being delicious.   Service was very nice! I slid in an order for a drink 5 minutes before Happy Hour ended, and saw that it was charged full price on my receipt. I asked the server if I could get that changed, and they gave me a new receipt without a hitch."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  I am not a fancy liquor drink drinker.  I am a straight beer drinker.  I hit up Hidden harbor on a Tuesday for the soft opening.  The menu was limited (can be seen in other posts.  We came for drinks, so I knew had to get an umbrella drink..Heck we are in a tiki bar. (they do have some really nice local beers).  When in Rome....I went with the Tropic Thunder.   It had a lot of accessories, like a really sweet shark stirrer, a cinnamon stick, and some fresh mint and a flower.  Pretty tasty, but I am not going to break down the liquors and cordials because, frankly, I just don't know.  It tasted good, and that is all I got.  The ambiance is neat.  It doesn't feel like a street in Squirrel Hill, but it takes you to somewhere warmer and more tropical which was needed on our wind chilly day.    I will go back, probably order a fancy drink and let Hidden Harbor whisk me away to somewhere warmer."}
{"text":"Came here twice for drinks with friends. I love this place because there is no where else like it. The atmosphere is so fun and the drinks are delicious and creative. I love that they have drinks to share and everything comes in a cup that has character. The second time I tried the nachos and they were not that special. I would like to go back and try the poke bowl because the couple sitting next to us had one and it looked like they really enjoyed it. Each time it has been a weeknight and not overly busy. I have always been able to get a seat."}
{"text":"Went recently with my wife just for a fun night out. We really loved all the fun cocktails and we tried a few of them. While they are a little pricey you really don't need more than one.  The food is excellent, we got the nachos, chicken tacos, and steak tacos. I really wanted to try the Poke but we were too full. The couple next to us got it and it looked amazing. The nachos and tacos were both excellent, both made with fresh ingredients from Reyna's.   The food menu is much shorter than the drink menu, but we were OK with that. Although, they definitely have a little room to expand their food offerings, which would keep us coming back to try different things (HH Folks, check out the menu at Ono Kine Grindz in Milwaukee, spamasubi, purple rice and more!)."}
{"text":"This place is a must try on the pittsburgh cocktail scene! Also makes the best mock tails for those DDs out there!  We were so excited to see what would open next to the already popular IBC. This place does not disappoint for a hopping cocktail place!  Walking in this place has great tiki ambiance, a nice amount of space between bench seating the bar and individual tables. We came with a group and loved sitting in their big booths.  We tried the tropic thunder- excellent drink which delivered with a ton of tropical and fruity yumminess.  I was DD and had the BEST MOCKTAIL EVER. I asked the waitress to have the bartender make whatever he wanted and she came back with a beautiful passion fruit creation that was dolled up with hibiscus flowers and a real cinnamon stick. Best part- it was only $4 and easily one of the most delicious perfectly sweet cocktails (mock or not) I've had in the last year!  Music was also very catchy and fun vibe.  service was attentive and excellent.  I must return and will! Can't wait to show my friends this place and try their food."}
{"text":"Oh my god. Their syrups are made in house and drool worthy (especially thr fassionola, which is a mystery tiki syrup with a ton of different fruits). I wish they sold them individually.  We sat at the bar and only got drinks, as their kitchen closed at 10 (Thursday night). I don't usually like whiskey, but their krakatoa was still 10/10.   Everything about their ambience is well executed."}
{"text":"If you are in Squirrel Hill you should visit Hidden Harbor.  If you're not in Squirrel Hill then make a point to get there and visit Hidden Harbor.  An elite event brought me here, but the cocktails forced me back.  This place is so awesome.  On my second visit I decided to drink around the menu.  I started with the Tropical Thunder, which I had already tried at the event.  I think it was even better the second time around.  Perfectly balanced yet complex.  This was the crème de la crème of the cocktails at Hidden Harbor, but I was in for a splendid treat.    From there I went to KRAKATOA (SERVES 2).  This Tiki drink reminded me of Jamaica.  So refreshing and so colorful.  Another masterfully designed drink.  Moving forward I tried the Hidden Harbor.  This drink came with a magical ice wave that really made you wish you were sitting on the beach.  Again, just a wonderful pairing of different spirits.    Well with several drinks down I decided to try just one more.  I went with the Leaf & Bean.  Mind blown.  This drink spoke to me.  It said you know you want me, and I said you are so right for me!  It is was so tasty I ordered two.  How could I just have one?  The rye whisky with the tobacco bitters mixed so perfectly in my mouth.  This is a must try if you like ryes, even if you think you don't like ryes you should still try it.  It could possibly change your mind for good.      After my excursion I realized I had really spent some money.  Opps wasn't thinking much about that during my little getaway.  It can add up quickly, but seriously it was worth it.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Such a cool place to go for drinks. Immediately upon walking in, I was amazed at the ambiance and tactful decorations. Despite the cool temps outside, it felt like I was in Hawaii. I ordered a drink with ginger beer in it (can't remember the name) that I did not particularly care for, although it was made well and garnished favorably.  We shared pork sliders and chicken tacos during happy hour. The sliders had a sweeter bread and sauce on the pork was good, but I didn't care for the combo of the bread with the pork as much as I thought I would. Too sweet isn't good, especially with Caribbean food. The chicken tacos were a 'hair' dry, but contained a mango salsa of some sort, which added flavor and consistency. The chicken tasted smokey and was seasoned well. The bathrooms were clean and spacious, and easy to find.   Dropped a few stars due to the variety of drinks not being totally to my liking. I'm more of a berry drink person or coconut and actually do not care for lime. It was hard to find a drink with no lime on the menu and they also didn't have many fruity options that weren't frozen. I also thought our bill was a little high- got 2 drinks and 2 apps during happy hour and our bill was $30.   Overall, amazing atmosphere, good service, and great place to come with friends, but not the cheapest around. If you're looking to save a penny, maybe catch the happy hour, instead! (HH special: 3-4 drink options for $6 and select apps for $6)."}
{"text":"Some of the most delicious cocktails around! Every single one is unique and looks as great as it tastes. Appetizers are great as well, especially any of their seasonal nachos."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in Squirrel Hill!   I don't typically frequent Squirrel Hill because I find it out of the way and not that exciting of a spot to grab drinks in. A friend suggested we hit up Hidden Harbor on a Saturday night around 6 pm. The place was PACKED when we arrived. There was a short wait for a table so we decided to find a seat at the bar. A friendly bartender greeted us right as we sat down - this is corny but I love that the staff wears Hawaiian shirts. Our bartender was super knowledgeable about the drinks (all their tiki-style drinks have a ridiculous amount of ingredients so it's a toss up to choose one), he recommended the rum barrel as I wanted something strong but without an intense rum taste. The drink was delicious, and definitely strong. After the rum barrel I opted for a Tecate as the tiki drinks are kind of pricey to have multiple.   After having a drink or two, we ordered the nachos with pork. They were good, but nothing out of this world. Probably wouldn't get them again. Moral of the story - Hidden Harbor is cool for a yummy cocktail but not really a place you stay for hours."}
{"text":"Beautiful cocktails. Wife and I went for date night and had a really wonderful time. The Krakatoa for two was super tasty and served in a shiny pineapple, and the hidden harbor cocktail has a literal wave of ice in it."}
{"text":"They are coming up on their one year anniversary in January but this place is such a hidden gem. I love rum so I thought I'd stop in and check them out. I'm so glad I did I will certainly come back here on a regular basis. I have a Rum Passport so I need 20 stamps to fill it up. I currently have to stamps so there's work to do. The Rum Passport is a brilliant idea and fun for rum lovers. The variety is amazing this is an opportunity to try rum from all over the world. They also have mixed drink and shared drinks. This place is great for solo missions or groups they have something for everyone. The way they accent/garnish their drinks is nothing short of top notch. Reminds me of the details from the tv show Bar Rescue. I also had a mixed drink and appetite. The pork slider was delicious and the wait time was very short. Love quick service. The bartender explained everything to me and checked in regularly. My mixed drink reminded me of a Caribbean rum punch. Very tasty! The service was outstanding. The prices are fair and I feel the quality is worth it. Very clean amd safe environment. Parking lot nearby because parking in Squirrel Hill can be hit or miss. I highly recommend this place and look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"My friend recently had a birthday, and was able to get a reservation here same day, which was great! I was excited to go, since I had been wanting to try this place for awhile. The space is warm and inviting, and does make you feel like you are in a tropical bar (even when it is only 20 degrees out!). We had a corner space at the front, with a comfy couch and ottomans with a central coffee table for our drinks. My friend brought a cake from the Oakmont Bakery, and the staff didn't mind at all and even provided plates and utensils.   The cocktail menu is extensive and unique with a lot of island-themed drinks. My friends' drinks arrived in large shells illuminated red with some kind of waterproof light (nice touch). Since I am allergic to pineapple I went to the bar and ordered a custom drink, requesting Amaro with a slightly sweet mixer. The drink came out and I was told it had rye whiskey. Since I do enjoy a good rye I didn't mind, but I would have liked the drink I actually requested (and I didn't feel like being \"that person\" who returns her drink repeatedly). Since it was tasty I didn't mind, and simply ordered straight amaro on the rocks for my next drink.   We stayed for a few hours, and enjoyed the evening. The noise level is adequate and the service quick, so it is a great place for a night out with friends. But I think that I will stick to Bar Marco or Meat and Potatoes for a quality cocktail."}
{"text":"I stopped by Hidden Harbor last night with a good friend.  Having heard that there was a brand new tiki bar in Squirrel Hill (of all places!), I suggested we check it out.  My friend was game, and the weather was appropriately frigid, so we took the bus over so we could get a proper buzz on from island-themed drinks.  Upon arrival, we were enthusiastically greeted by the host, and were informed that no tables were available, but that we could hang out at the drink rail in the corner while awaiting one.  We decided to do that, so we hung out there while imbibing our first round of drinks: a fassionola fizz for me ($12) and an Ishmael for my friend ($11).  As the name might suggest, the fizz is a gin-based drink with fassionola (tropical fruit cordial), seltzer, and cream, and made for a light and refreshing start to the evening.  The Ishmael is a darker drink based on two types of rum that also includes fig, guava, and almond extract, and seemed quite stiff from the sip I tried.  Upon obtaining the drinks, after having been at the drink rail approx. 20 min, a table opened up and we were able to sit down.  Upon being seated, we decided to try the tuna tacos ($10).  For me, these were the letdown of the night, given that one order consisted of three tiny tacos, and I found them rather flavorless.  The seared tuna tasted like what I imagine cat food must taste like (bland and chewy) and the harissa aioli didn't add any kick--the only redeeming aspect was the falafel croutons.  After having consumed them and finished off our first round of drinks, we opted for a second round.  This time, I ordered the tropic thunder and my friend ordered the Josie's faraway vacation ($12 each).  In contrast to my first drink, the tropic thunder was a rum-based drink with various flavors, including bitters, absinthe, grapefruit, cinnamon, and lime.  To my surprise, the Josie's ended up being my favorite drink of the evening.  Also a rum-based drink, it contains coconut milk and cream, as well as basil and a hint of chili, and is served frozen, such that it tastes kind of like a mix between an alcoholic slushee and milkshake.  Had I ordered that drink, I can guarantee that it would have gone down *waaay* too smoothly and easily--so perhaps it's a good thing I didn't...  The ambiance was warm and had fun tiki-themed accents, including the wooden mask carvings that can be viewed in photos.  Service was pretty good, despite it being super crowded.  Given that they're currently in their soft opening phase, it's unclear whether the final menu will have the same items and whether the selection will be expanded.  I would hope that it ultimately includes some more substantial food offerings similar to its sister IBC next door--though the tuna tacos and the offerings there lead me to wonder whether they'd be similar in quality.  One additional thing worth noting is the poko-lulu drink, a bowl drink intended for sharing between 4 people, which seems quite popular based on my observation (disclaimer: you'll definitely need a ride home if you order it!).  If you're in the mood for something surprising and different, or just want to escape the depressing PGH winter weather, definitely be sure to check out this fun new addition to the Squirrel Hill community!"}
{"text":"Hidden Harbor is really good. The drinks are fantastic and the menu is really well laid out. I've had consistently excellent service.  When you arrive, they offer menus almost immediately. I've only ever had a 15-20 minute wait for a table or space at the bar.  The drinks are well made and they have a nice selection of stronger and fruitier drinks. The menu is really self explanatory of giving you an idea of what you're getting. While most drinks are rum based, they have vodka and whiskey based items as well. It's a really nice mix.   If you can get a spot at the bar, I'd recommend it. I enjoy seeing all the different drinks made.   I haven't had the food, but it looks good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time at Hidden Harbor. The atmosphere and decor were really great. The drink menu was full of specialty tiki-style drinks it was hard to pick which one I wanted to try. I ended up with the Ishmael and was impressed. It was fruity and flavorful without being overly sweet and sugary. Our server told us that is their goal....to serve this style of drink without all of the added sugar and fake juices. The Ishmael is: VIRGIN ISLANDS RUM, CLOVE-INFUSED JAMAICAN RUM, LEMON, FIG, GUAVA, ALMOND EXTRACT, MINT. The clove is very strong. It isn't too much, but it is definitely what you taste the most. I had a friend that tried the Green Jacket. It is like a Mojito without the club soda. It has cryo-muddled mint which was interesting, but to be honest they'd be better off with regular muddled mint. The cryo-muddled mint was mashed up into such tiny bits that it was hard to drink it without getting green mint bits all through your teeth. Don't order this one on a date or make sure you ask for a straw!"}
{"text":"A neighborhood gem! Great date night spot featuring fresh food; shareable cocktails; fun tiki décor; and friendly, attentive service. I really enjoyed the tuna poke bowl and jaguar shark. Gets busy - reservation recommended."}
{"text":"Great Tiki bar/lounge... Very upscale and the drinks were very intricate and detailed.. I had the hidden harbor and the tropic thunder... The place is pricey so don't be cheap... Delicious, I recommend the hidden harbor it's there signature drink and is great."}
{"text":"High quality decor, drinks pretty good and garnished very well. We love the ambience   The food was subpar. Sliders way too sweet, we don't eat lamb or raw fish and the other selections were not appealing. I'd suggest adding some awesome potato sticks, fries or mushrooms. Maybe falafel ....it would be cool to have designer popcorn , flavored in spices or something while drinking tiki cocktails"}
{"text":"It pains me to say it, but I have to downgrade this one.  I was super excited to try the new menu, because I have loved chef Jamilka's take on each restaurant she's been at.  This meal though, was not great.  All in all, it's an expensive place to drink and an uncomfortable place to sit...so the food really needed to bring it up.  But it just didn't.       I will say that I did enjoy the shrimp ceviche.  It was fresh and light and not filled with a bunch of raw onion (as so many ceviches are).  The plantain chips got a little soggy in the bowl with it and there weren't quite enough of them, but it was good overall.     The plantain canoe, though, was awful.   Really awful.  It was described as a sweet plantain, which led me to expect that it would be sweet and soft.  This thing was a dry hard rock - texturally unappealing and not even a little sweet.  The filling was actually pretty good, but the boat itself was the majority of the dish and was so bad that none of us enjoyed it even a little.  Perhaps it is indeed authentic and was served how it's supposed to be, but we all thought it was dreadful.   It was also on the small side for an entrée - it could have used a little something on the side to break it up a little.    In the end, I don't love it."}
{"text":"Hidden Harbor is a hidden gem. Fun cocktails unique foods make this place worth visiting time and again. Visited for my 22nd anniversary and might go back for our 23rd!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile but I'm never in Squirrel Hill when they're open. I've been to Hawaii a couple times and love some of their popular dishes, so there are definitely some things on their menu I still have to try (particularly the Poke). I went for happy hour tonight and ordered the Painkiller, Mai Tai and Avocado Nachos with curry steak. The nachos were tasty and the drinks were amazing. I'm not particularly crazy about overly-sweet drinks so I normally wouldn't order this style at a regular restaurant I went out to. These were a perfect blend of hand-crafted, fresh ingredients and I want to try all of them. This was definitely on-par with other high-end Tiki bars I've been to such as Three Dots & a Dash (Chicago) and Porco Tiki Lounge (Cleveland). Will absolutely be back soon."}
{"text":"Had my wife's surprise party here last Friday- this is an excellent and very accommodating event space for up to 16 people or so! The waitress did an amazing job keeping track of the checks through many rounds of drinks. On top of that, the food was delicious and the drinks were all very tasty. Adam (their event specialist) was so helpful! Great experience, absolutely would do it again."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place!!! The decor is awesome!! It's such a unique little spot nestled in the area. We got the shark drink which was delicious and super cute! They had a couple tables outside which was nice to sit at."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night around 8.30pm and the place was quite packed. We wanted to have a table for 3 and the receptionist told us it would be probably an hour until we would get seated. We were willing to wait at the bar and start with a cocktail. Surprisingly we got seated after only 30 min.  The place has a quite laid back, hipster vibe to it, which I really liked. The music was not too loud, so it was easy to have conversations without screaming at each other. The staff was super friendly, knowledgeable and fun.  Throughout the night we ordered pretty much every cocktail they have on the menu and none of them was a let down. From the presentation to taste to size, it was perfect! I very much enjoyed the Kokomo and the Fizz. All the flavor combinations were wonderful. Nothing too sweet and no flavor was overpowering.  Food wise we had the seared tuna, the pork sliders and the meatballs. I wasn't the biggest fan of their tuna, as it just tasted like cumin, and the rest of the dish such as the falafel croutins and the sauce did not really add anything to the dish, but I did enjoy the pork sliders and meatballs.  The music was a bit hit and miss, didn't really feel like you're actually at a tiki bar, they played music from the 80s to hip hop to pop, and everything in between.   All in all, I'll definitely recommend this place for an after work wind-down with friends. The drinks and staff are amazing!"}
{"text":"I got the daiquiri and it was soo good! A bit strong, but good for a lightweight like me :) The 3 other people I were with also enjoyed their drinks!"}
{"text":"Great cute spot!! Ahi tuna bowl was amazing with the coconut rice :) I ordered the puerto Escondido and it was delicious  my boyfriends mom got the Rum Cannonball and that was delicious as well!!!!!"}
{"text":"Eh, it's fine. The theme is fun when you're in the mood for something different than normal. However, you're definitely paying for that theme with the drink prices (I haven't tried their happy hour, but other reviews seem to recommend it). If the prices were lower, I'd probably would have come here more - simply because it was down the street from where I used to work and was clean. Additionally, it's one of my close friend's favorite places. But, personally, I don't think the kitschy cups and drink names are worth the prices.  Come here if you need a break from your normal routine."}
{"text":"Maybe you just need a vacation. Maybe you need a vacation, from your vacation. Maybe you just need a cocktail with some pretty flowers and an umbrella. Maybe you just need some good vibes.  Any and all of the above can be found here.  Now don't get it twisted. This is not just a bar with sweet tropical drinks. These are cocktails, crafted with artful knowledge and care. Regardless of what you normally drink, you will still find a delightful bevvy to suit your tastes here.  I ordered the Hidden Habor, which is quite the visual dazzler with a wave-like ice formation. It was not only beautiful to look at, but also very tasty. (And not too sweet!) I also took a sip of Josie's Faraway Vacation (Rum, lime, curacao, basil, chili, ginger, mint and coconut.) I have no idea who Josie is, but I want to vacation with her. While that might sound like there's a lot going on there in the flavor department, everything blends well together and the stronger ingredients are subtle.   While it was a little out of the way from where I was staying downtown, it was well worth the 10-15 minute travel adventure.   Can't wait to do it again!"}
{"text":"A great addition to squirrel hill! Hidden harbor has delicious drinks and fantastic food.   The tripleta sandwich was great and flavorful, and the plantain chips were fantastic. The sauce on the side was so so good.   The drinks are much more affordable during happy hour and I like that they tell you how much alcohol to expect in your drinks."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour on Friday night and as usual the drinks were great! The happy hour only runs from 5-6, so be sure to get here early. My husband loves their painkillers, so he got 2 of those! My favorite is Don's special daiquiri with Maggie's farm rum. I also got the Queen's Park swizzle which was really good.  I took off 1 star because I wish the service was a little bit better. We were sitting outside and the service just isn't quite as seamless as it feels like it should be, but no issues that would keep us from coming back!"}
{"text":"Although I've been to Hidden Harbor a large number of times I haven't reviewed it yet.   We went last night for their excellently priced happy hour for drinks. I had my favorite: two Painkillers at $6 each. If you haven't ever had a Painkiller I'd say drop what you're doing, head over and have one.   They're a great, classic, tiki-bar style cocktail that used to be popular. I love them because they're a) strong and b) simple. It's basically rum, OJ and Creme de coconut with some nutmeg sprinkled on top. They're super good and at happy hour prices a total steal!  We didn't have any food last time, but I've had food here a number of times. I'd say it decent. Some of the items are better than others. I'd say come here for the drinks rather than the food, but that's just me!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 - 4... Went to Hidden Harbor for happy hour with my wife on a Friday evening. The atmosphere will transport you Hawaii, it is very well decorated. The wait staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I enjoyed an Appleton old fashioned and my wife had a drink with gingerbeer and  rum. I think she would have given her drink a 3/5 but it was very strong. My old fashioned was pretty good.  We also enjoyed pork sliders and chicken tacos. I thought the pork sliders were good but a little on the sweet side. The bread was a little tough which made the slider a bit messy to eat. The chicken tacos were ok in my opinion ...seemed like it was missing a little salt and the flavors did not marry together as I hoped it would. The chicken was a little dry, but i may be nit picking.  I believe this place is a solid spot to grab some drinks with friends before going out, or a place to bring friends that may be visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"I was really excited to find out that we had a new Hawaiian themed bar in Pittsburgh. Especially one that serves amazing poke. I've only ever seen poke served at one other Pittsburgh restaurant and it didn't quite remind me of what I had in Hawaii.   The drinks here are so much fun and are made to perfection by the friendly staff.  Connor was our bartender when we were here and he couldn't have been nicer."}
{"text":"What a fun place! The drinks are tiki classics; new riffs on classics; and all-around amazing and fun. But don't think you can't get a Manhattan or Old Fashioned here because you can. The bartenders are serious professionals who absolutely know what they're doing. They've got quality ingredients (and ONLY quality ingredients. Don't bother asking for Watermelon Pucker or Bud Light). All juices are squeezed fresh daily, all syrups are made in house. There's an awesome collection of high-end rums for sipping like brandy.  And if you really don't want a tiki drink, have a \"Leaf and Bean.\" There's rye whiskey in it, with a cinnamon stick that's set on fire (and then extinguishes like incense) to add a smoky aroma to your drink. This drink belongs in ANY bar, tiki or not.  They have a rum \"passport\" available where, if you try about 20 (don't quote me) specific rums from 20 locales and get your passport stamped for each, you become a member of the Dead Parrot Society with a cool reward.  This is a wonderful stop on a hot summer night but just as much so on a cold winter's eve."}
{"text":"We joined friends on a frigid night for tropical drinks in this cute Tiki Bar. Our server was attentive and the variety of mostly rum-based drinks impressive and delicious. The food selection is not as broad as the drinks, but what they have appeals to vegetarians as well as omnivores and is well-executed. Our table of four tried five different drinks, the crab rangoon nachos, two kinds of poke, and two kinds of tacos. It was all delicious. The portions are modest, leaving room for calories from the drinks or dessert from one of Squirrel Hill's many treat shops. Parking can be tricky, so walk or ride share if you can."}
{"text":"I've had Hidden Harbor on my list for quite some time now but was never really in the mood for some reason. Squirrel Hill always feels a little out of the way and I'm not a huge drinker so the timing was just never there. When my friend asked where I wanted to go to celebrate my promotion I instantly picked Hidden Harbor. Who doesn't want to celebrate a big promotion at a tiki themed restaurant?!  As soon as you walk in the decor instantly makes you feel like you are on a island getaway. I completely forgot that I lived in Pittsburgh where it was currently only about 30 degrees and rainy outside. The place isn't that large so I would probably recommend making a reservation if you are planning to go on a busy night. We made one just in case and I was very happy we did. Almost all of the tables were full of people hanging out and drinking with friends and there was only about 2-3 spots open at the bar as well.  Looking at the drinks prices I was a little hesitant thinking this would be one of those restaurants that charges a lot for a \"fancy\" drink but there is very little alcohol in the drink. This is most definitely not the case here. While $15 for a drink may seem expensive it actually has the alcohol content of 2 drinks and you can taste that right away as you take your first sip. I ended up going with the rum barrel and it was the best decision ever. The drink was absolutely delicious! I can't wait to go back and have another one.  Sadly, I ate before coming not realizing they were going to have so many tasty food options on their menu. I would have really liked to try the nachos, salmon tacos, or one of the poke bowls. Now that I know this I will be planning to go back very soon!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! It was very fun to visit as a tourist in Pittsburgh. I loved all the cocktails and so did my friends. Would definitely recommend to others who are in the area. There were lots of different drinks to chose from so everyone was happy!"}
{"text":"I've visited this location a few times over the course of the past 6 months. The atmosphere makes it a great location to hang out with friends or significant other, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and the drinks are garnished with fresh flowers.   My favorite drink is called the Kokomo, with a close second being the fizzy one that tastes like a creamsicle. They pour with a heavy hand, so be sure to pace yourself here! Each drink is between $10-$15, but with how strong they are I feel like I am definitely getting my moneys worth and do not mind buying one and sipping for the duration of the stay.   It is not a full-service bar, so if you are expecting well drink specials it unfortunately will not be the place for you. On one occasion I got the pork belly \"sliders\", which simply turned out being two delicious regular sized sandwiches on Hawaiian bread. Definitely great for sharing!   This place is a great addition to Squirrel Hill, which surprisingly doesn't have more bars for how many young adult/older graduate students are in the area. They closed at 1pm on a Saturday night, so be mindful if you are looking for a late night on the weekend."}
{"text":"I've never been to the Islands but this place certainly makes me want to go! With all the tropical drinks and the tropical atmosphere, you just can't help it!   The restaurant itself isn't very big and is split half is the bar and half dining room seating. We only had drinks so I can't speak for the food but the drinks themselves will bring me back!   It's a great fun place to stop and grab drinks with friends. They even had several drinks that serve 2-4 people if you don't mind sharing. I will say that these mixed drinks are by no means wimpy in the actual alcohol department. I'm sort of a light weight and 2 drinks was too much for me because of all the rum! So if you're like me or someone who prefers mixed drinks that are more fruity, this might not be the place for you.   I prefer the Rum Barrel to the Curse of Pele as far as taste goes but, as you can see from my pictures, the Curse of Pele is served with a sugar cube lit on fire which was really cool! Every drink is served in its own special way like this, a different glass, edible flowers, lit of fire, etc!   Each single drink is between $10-$15. The bar tenders were very nice and I liked the relaxed tropical atmosphere. Will be back"}
{"text":"I LOVE Hidden Harbor! The Tiki bar in Squirrel Hill manages to be fun, yet avoid gimmicks that cheapen the appeal. Their drink choices are creative and tasty with just enough of a tropical punch to brighten your day during a long Pittsburgh winter.   The space is small, so during the colder months when there aren't any tables outside, it is important to arrive earlier in the night to be sure that you can get a seat."}
{"text":"Looking to slip away to a quiet little tropical isle where colors of the sunset and cool, cool rum drinks surround? You won't have to board ship or plane to escape the mundane anymore, because there's a hidden harbor of tropical delights awaiting. In Squirrel Hill. What?!   This lovely little spot is called Hidden Harbor, a place sure to make all your tiki and tropical dreams come true with well crafted tiki and tropical cocktails and themed small bites that whisk you away to an island vacation, if only in your mind.  A collection of top tiki bartenders (tikitenders?) create cocktails using the best of the best liquors and fresh ingredients. Wes, Max, and Greta (and sometimes Adam) shake up drinks like the Tropic Thunder, Fashionola Fizz, and the signature Hidden Harbor, to name just a few. Then there are the tiki drinks for 2 or 4...fun to share with friends for sure!  The kitchen was kind enough to adapt the pulled pork sliders for my gluten free needs by turning them into mini tacos on corn tortillas instead of the standard bun. Yum. You're gonna love these! My dining companion really enjoyed the sweet and smoky Chicken and Bacon Meatballs. Also on the menu are veggie tacos, ahi tuna tacos...and a selection of other tasty small bites.  Despite the name, Hidden Harbor isn't hard to find at all, it's right next door to The Independent Brewing Company on Shady Avenue. (In fact, both establishments share the same ownership.) Make a point of searching out this \"Hidden\" gem of a \"Harbor\" the next time you find yourself in need of a quick mental vacation AND a damned good drink. Ahhhhhhhhhhh......"}
{"text":"Ultra chic decor, atmosphere, and music in a laid back way.  Hidden Harbor has some of the best mixed drinks in this city expertly mixed and many created by Adam or one of the other talented bartenders. We had a CMU class reunion event here and the food and service was spot on.  Check out 'Alternative History' artist and DJ on Thursday nights.  GreAt mix of tunes from 80s and 90s euro invasion, post punk and 2000s best of indie Rock.  Rock on!"}
{"text":"Drinks: 3.5 Service: 3 Ambiance: 3  Came here in a group of 6, was seated at a booth table, which was a slightly too-tight squeeze. Would not be good for larger groups.   The Greenjacket (white rum, lime, mint) was fair, very minty and tasty, but not super wowing.  Ms Beffrey asked the bartender to surprise her with a zero-proof -- and the bartender delivered with a delicious fassionola/passion fruit/cinnamon concoction.  Did not try any food this time.  Ambiance was an interesting overall hipster vibe due to the combination of industrial (exposed rafters, exposed raw brick walls) and tiki (palm tree prints and giant tiki totem).  The music was slightly loud, but helped to cover the roar of conversation (pet peeve of Ms Beffrey is hearing everyone else's convos).  Good potential, and seems like solid bartenders, as the ability to whip up a surprise zero-proof that's delicious is surprisingly rare. Eager to see how this place continues to develop."}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour with my cousin which is from 5pm-6pm. Their drink prices aren't bad they are reasonable considering how nice the drinks are. The happy hour prices are great though! The first drink I ordered was the el Diablo it had tequila and ginger beer in it, it was good. The second drink I ordered was I believe the dons special daiquiri but I might be mistaken. The daiquiri was by far my favorite drink I ordered it was delicious it had passion fruit mixed in it I would definitely order that drink again. The whole atmosphere of the place is just adorable I love how it is decorated it isn't too over the top to make it look cheesy it is just perfect. The service was really good. I would like to come back again to try some other drinks they had on their menu! They also have a water fountain outside their front door that is for humans and dogs so cute!"}
{"text":"Great bar!! Max was our bartender and was super nice and helpful.  Food looks amazing!! But we were going to dinner elsewhere.  Definitely recommend!  Max told us they also use a merchant run, very high quality, that's made especially for Hudson Harbor.  Great place!!!"}
{"text":"What atmosphere! Adorable does not do it justice. Yummy yummy but a little pricey drinks. Great service. The food we tasted was minimal but their menu is also minimal. What we tasted was good. I'd like to go back to try more, especially the poke. It was a fun, but not overly loud happy hour crowd."}
{"text":"Feels like you're on vacation!! I seriously love this place. Tasty drinks at a tasty price--especially during happy hour (5-6pm). Been here multiple times but the sweetest was when they gave my friend a flaming birthday drink on the house!  Bartenders are fab and waitstaff are attentive! They do accept reservations if you call ahead!"}
{"text":"I love all things here. The vibe here is very young and trendy. Once you walk in, you see this beautiful tiki bar that offers you a large spread of fabulously ornate drinks. Each drink is garnished in a spectacular way; some of the decorations on the drinks that we ordered included a carnation flower dusted in powdered sugar, a twisted pineapple wedge, a flaming lime half and even a wooden back-scratcher (I believe that last decoration was on a drink called the \"tropical itch\"! If the garnishings weren't over the top for you, the glasses the drinks come in will surely do the trick. The glasses are in funs shapes like a fish, a shark mouth, a cactus, etc.  If you decide to grab a food item, I highly recommend the poke bowel.   *Note, this place is fairly popular on the weekends so be ready to wait for a place to sit at the bar or at a table."}
{"text":"The drinks are overpriced but what a great place! Got a really cool shark drink with lights and the dip is fantastic! I would highly recommend this place for a casual get together or unique date!"}
{"text":"I'm so digging the Allegheny Rum Punch and I usually HATE raw salmon, but the salt-cured salmon in the Lomi-Lomi is excellent! The flavors have melded together and seasoning is just right!   Wait a minute, I thought that the Allegheny Rum Punch was my favorite, but now the Tropic Thunder has surpassed it! And the Lamb Curry is ridiculous! Come on, man! And the Josie's Faraway Vacation drink is a lovely well balanced drink that is a tad on the sweet side, but not overly so.    Overall, such a lovely and intimate experience.  Love, love, love!"}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of tiki themed bars. There are two in Chicago that I frequently visit, so I was very pleased to see one here in Pittsburgh. Everything about the Hidden Harbor makes me happy. The decorations, the vibe, the drinks. Being a regular at other tiki bars, I noticed many similarities to the drink options (and that is not a bad thing!) My wife and two of our friends got a variety of different drinks and even splurged to get the group drink. All of the drinks that we had were delicious! I was not disappointed at all by the Hidden Harbor and I definitely will be returning in the future. I can't wait to explore the rest of the menu (and even try some food) and see what else they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Aloha!! After a long day at work, (up at 5 AM out at 3PM) I looked forward to going to get a snack and drink.   I was greeted at the door by the hostess and promptly lei'ed. Kitchy but a nice touch. I was also given a welcome drink even before my coat was off! Hooray! The room where we were seated was beautiful. The furniture was handmade and just was awesome. There were even carved gods around the room. It really made you feel like you were far away and not stuck in snowy Pittsburgh.  Drinks: Allegheny Rum Punch: Maggie's Farm rum, Wiggle Landlocked honey spirit, Boyd & Blair Stonewall Rum, lemon, demerara, black tea, mint, peach bitters.   This was my favorite drink of the night. I love tea and this was just sweet enough for me. It was refreshing but not overpowering. I like the simpleness of the recipe and how it was presented. The fact that it used all three rums made in Pittsburgh made it even better! Hooray for hometown rum.   Fassinola Fizz: Gin, lemon, fassinola (tropical fruit cordial), cream, egg white, seltzer, orange flower water.   This drink was aesthetically pleasing for sure. It is a light pink with a fluffy creamy top that just makes you want to dive right in. It was also topped with a beautiful flower. I didn't want to try it at all because I just wanted to look at it. I will say that I enjoyed the fluffy creamy top more than the drink. I thought it was good but it was a little bitter for my taste. But then again, I am a sweeter drinker so this could be just my weird taste buds.   Tropic Thunder: House 5-rum blend, lime, grapefruit, macadamia orgeat, cinnamon, grenadine, falerum (lime, ginger & clove cordial), curacao, absinthe, bitters.  This drink came with a twisty straw, a shark stirrer, and a umbrella. ****The shark is really sharp so do not put it in your pocket**** I loved the look of this drink. It came with fun things to make you want to order more of them. The extras put this drink number 3 on my list of favorite drinks of the night. It was fun to look at and a good drink.   Josie's Faraway Vacation: Arrack (Indonesian rum), Jamaican rum, lime, curacao, basil, chili, ginger, mint, coconut milk, coconut cream.   Number 2 on my list of favorite drinks of the night. It was a beautiful creamy white drink topped with a beautiful purple flower. I loved this coconut drink. I will even say that for how much coconut was in this drink it was not overpowering. I loved it!! It was frozen so I did get a brain freeze. But it did not stop me from drinking it down!  Snacks: Lomi-Lomi: House salt-cured salmon, tomato, red onion, cumin, jalapeno, citrus, wonton chips.   This was lovely. The taste that we were given was really something. The wonton was amazing. It was crunchy and was dusted with something that had a kick to it. The easiest way to describe the lomi-lomi is pico with pieces of salmon mixed with it. It was good.   Veggie Crostini: Shishito peppers, grilled onion, falafel croutons, harissa aioli, pineapple bun.  Ok, I do not know what a pineapple bun is, but you could taste pineapple in the crostini. The falafel croutons were awesome. They were just the right amount of crunch to top off the softness of the peppers and onions. The harissa aioli was surprising and also very good. You could taste how it mixed just right with the veggies.   Lamb Curry: Braised local leg of lamb, tomato, coconut, cream.  YUUUUMMMM. This was a perfect curry. The lamb was cooked perfectly. Not stringy or tough just broke apart in your mouth. The curry was mixed and had an amazing tasted to it. Not overly spicy but still had a kick. It was the crowning snack of the night.   It was a fun place and I can see myself going there again."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! The drinks are a bit pricey, but you're getting a delicious craft cocktail - so it's worth it IMO. The decor is cute and island-y. The food looked delicious but I didn't try anything aside from drinks. Service was quick and pleasant although they were packed!   Definitely would come back to explore the menu a bit more!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh needs more places like this! Ventured to Squirrel Hill on a Saturday and made sure to arrive right around the time they were opening since we didn't have a reservation. I'm glad we did, because one of the owners gave us a really awesome mini-tour of the restaurant and we had time to chat with him about it before it started to pick up (which definitely didn't take long!).  Everything in Hidden Harbor from the menu items to the decor is very well-thought-out, down to the smallest detail. Super impressive. We tried a good mix of drinks and bites, all of which were delicious.  The ahi tuna in my poke bowl was perfect. I also appreciated the shark icons next to the drinks signifying which ones were on the stronger side. The Kokomo (one of the less strong drinks offered) was a refreshing version of a Moscow Mule with coconut-washed vodka.  I loved how we didn't feel rushed even the tiniest bit, even when it started to get more and more crowded. I hope to return soon to take advantage of half-off happy hour (Tuesday through Friday from 5-6 PM) and to grab a drink at Independent Brewing Company right next door, which is operated by the same owners as Hidden Harbor."}
{"text":"The decor is somewhat retro industrial chic.   They got these Mad Men days stylish contemporary coffee tables, and movable blocks of wood that are used as chairs, which allow groups to collect and form.  Also, very nice to have a slab of wood with a soft long cushion seat along the front window, creating a nice large lounge area feel and a long linear collective seating space, fostering social contact and conversation, with a central coffee table structural setting, really creating a salon-like atmosphere.    75% of the menu space is devoted to beverages, and only three items on the menu were eatables.  One of the eatables was salmon with condiments, and posted price of $8.  But the three salmon strips in the dish were very VERY small, 0.5 cm thick, 5 cm long, and 1 cm wide.  You can find that price in Cambridge Harvard Square, but never should be in yinzer-land."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favourite bar in all of Pittsburgh. I've fallen in love with the atmosphere, the decor, the service - all of which are exceptional. They dress up their drinks that truly make you feel like you're somewhere tropical. This place is like no other bar I've ever been to. I highly recommend sitting inside to immerse yourself in the tropical theme, but sitting outside on a beautiful night is just as refreshing. This is a perfect place to have a casual hang out with friends. All of the drinks are wonderfully made - but seriously, pay attention to the sharks! Strong drinks are noted (which is SO NICE by the way) so don't take it lightly. The Rum Cannonball is a personal favourite of mine."}
{"text":"A super cute beach tropical themed bar in Squirrel Hill. My friends and I came for happy hour on a Friday. They have a ton of different drinks and some big shared drinks. We had the jaguar shark drink to share, which was adorable as it came in a shark. Even the happy hour drinks were all very aesthetically pleasing. Food wise, I had the salmon poke bowl. The salmon was delicious as well as the sauce. However, I was not a fan of the coconut rice. Overall, a fun place to go to and escape the Pittsburgh weather and transport to the tropics for an hour or two."}
{"text":"We didn't realize what a unique bar this was until our first drinks were delivered with the most beautiful flowers on top. The couple at the table next to ours was drinking from a shallow bowl that was on fire (they had very long straws)...can that be right? We also enjoyed the tacos that were on the menu. Lots of great flavor and just the perfect accompaniment to the fancy drinks. Wish I lived closer so that I could go back to try the drink that is delivered in the golden fish and also to have my favorite again, the Oka Kope Kooler."}
{"text":"Wanting to find something new I turned to Yelp this past Saturday night. And it let me to Hidden Harbor.  Some of my favorite things in life include: pineapples, banana leaves, mermaids, fun cocktails and funny bartenders.... and this place has them ALL. Seriously ladies, where did you get those aprons?!   Initially we planned on dining here as well, the hostess only had a small bench for us to sit at. We took it. We waited for a while but no one came to check on us... I'm guessing they might have been busy tending to an 8 top next to us... so we ate elsewhere and came back for some drinks. It was still very busy but we found a free space in the front with a little ledge bar.   The server said it would take a while for us to get a Fassionola Fizz so we ordered a Greenjacket and the Tokyo Drift (the one in a fun fish cup that's also on fire! woo)... I was expecting to be blown away by the Greenjacket.. but all I did was continue to check my teeth for green bits! Ha! It was good, but not great. We asked for our tab but our server already put in the order for the Fassionola Fizz, which was nice of him.... it was delish!!!!   Someone standing near us had the Leaf & Bean and it smelled heavenly. I will definitely check that out next time. Seriously loved all the gorgeous flowers in the drinks!  This is definitely a great place to go when you're looking for something new and fun to do, celebrating an event, entertaining out of town guests... Not really a place to do some serious drinking though as it can get expensive really quickly."}
{"text":"Super cute. Very friendly staff. Delicious drinks.  Who doesn't want to escape a grey Pittsburgh day and pretend you're in the tropics? My husband and I heard about Hidden Harbor from a couple people and decided to try it out for Happy Hour. I ordered a Daiquiri and he ordered an Old Fashioned. The Daiquiri was made with Maggie's Farm Rum, which is local, and it had the perfect amount of alcohol- not crazy strong, but it had a kick. Besides that, of course it had a Tiki Bar feel, and I really enjoyed the music- it was older beachy music. I'd be curious to try the food and some of the other drinks but my first impression was great and I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good.  Atmosphere is superb, location is spectacular, drinks were amazing, people there are nice... BUT the tacos weren't as I expected. Got the happy hour chicken and pork tacos. The chicken had chard/burnt/hard/crunchy/black pieces in it, and the pork was not flavored as I had anticipated. I expected more from the tacos, but they weren't bad at all - just not as expected. I think they were missing a sweeter element to them seeing as the place is island themed (especially the pork).   Aside from that - everything was great! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with a friend and was not disappointed. It's a tiki bar and he decor is tropical and fun. We sat at a cute little cocktail style table with a stool and bench and the table was small but it worked. We ordered food so our table space was a little crowded. I got the mofongo and it was delicious and filling. The drinks are to die for. Happy hour is from 5-6 and it's half off some of their house specials, about 6-10 options. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with some friends for happy hour because I work at a tiki bar in another city and thought it could be fun. Our server sucked, didnt have a personality wasnt social and when i told my friend to get a zombie he tried telling her not to get it as her \" first\" tiki drink\". It wasnt her first tiki drink FYI. We would have had a better time if our server  was nicer and had better knowledge of the menu!!"}
{"text":"We have been to Hidden Harbor a few times and each time we visit we can't wait to come back.  I wish this place was closer to where we live but then if they were we would never have any money!       The first time we came here we walked in almost right when they opened on a Saturday.  It wasn't busy and it let us really look at the menu and talk to the bartender to see what would be best for us.  The bartenders were great!  Very knowledgeable, friendly, and they helped me figure out what to get.         The second time that we came here was a lot later in the night on a Saturday.  Not too late maybe 930?  It was packed!  Great for them but we did luck out and had a cute cozy little spot on the side of the bar.  The little spot made us feel like we were special guest or something because it was just for two people and it was kind of behind the bar.  It was busy but we still got pretty good service from the bartender.  We had a few drinks, they took a few pictures for us which was nice of them, and we really enjoyed our second visit.       In the day time it was just a chill kind of atmosphere.  Nice reggae music that reminded my wife and I of our wedding/honeymoon in Jamaica.  At night they have the lights dimmed and it's a nice place to have a few tiki drinks with your loved one and just chill out for the rest of the evening.  We didn't try any food here because we had already eaten dinner both times.       The drinks that I had were the Hidden Harbor and Josie's Faraway vacation.  I really like both.  The Hidden Harbor drink is so cool looking.  The bartender said that they freeze the ice before to get it to look that cool and it just enhances the drink.  Since I do the driving I can only drink about two of these drinks.  I would love to taste more and I eventually will.  My wife's favorite drink here is the Leaf & Bean.  It is so cool looking as well but very strong.  It's not a fruity type of drink so if you're more into a strong kind of drink try this one.  They also have a few big drinks that you can share with your loved one.  Check it out!       We will be back hopefully soon and I only I wish that they were open on Sundays.  It would be perfect to have a drink here after brunch!  Oh well Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour, got a few drinks and some food. The drinks were inventive and fresh. Worth ordering the more complicated drinks not on the happy hour menu for full price. The food was just OK. We ordered the jackfruit sliders which were overly sweet and very difficult to eat due to the softness of the bun which had become soaked in sauce. The chicken tacos were fine but nothing to write home about. In summary, come for the cocktails, skip the food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic tiki drinks this is what he place.  I'm a rum and tiki enthusiast and have yet to be disappointed by a cocktail.   They use nothing but the highest quality ingredients and   make most of their own mixers in house. However, be warned that the drinks are higher end which means a couple will put you on your butt and you get what you pay for.   If your curious, try them at happy hour as they have a good selection of cocktails half off.   My favorite cocktail bars in Pittsburgh? Acacia, Hidden Harbor, and The Summit."}
{"text":"I think that this was one of the most fun and creative bars I've been to in a long time.  First of all, the place wasn't overly packed - and it was around 10 PM on a Saturday night. It wasn't impossible to hear my friends. We all ordered a variety of drinks, and everyone loved them. I wanted to try the drink that was to be split between two people, but didn't get around to it. The bartender was very kind and accommodating!   I didn't know what to expect with a Tiki bar, but it was super fun and not \"cheesy\" at all! Loved this place and I can't wait to come back when I am back in the burgh.  I wish that Pittsburgh had been this cool when I lived here :)"}
{"text":"Hidden Harbor is honestly one of the best hidden gems in Pittsburgh. You'd probably never guess that you'd find an astounding tiki bar behind a small blue neon sign on a street in Squirrel Hill.   When you step inside Hidden Harbor, you're transported to a different place. This is not your average tiki bar with tacky leis and grass skirts; on the contrary, Hidden Harbor brings a certain class to their tiki decor. The smaller wooden tables with poufs and benches allow an intimate and laid back vibe. The plants hanging from the ceiling, dim lighting, and large wooden tiki statue will make you feel like you're truly in the islands! If the decor isn't enough, the drinks will knock your socks off.  The price of the cocktails may be a turn off when you first survey the menu, but they are well worth the price and I guarantee that you will not be disappointed. I have never discovered a cocktail that I do not like at Hidden Harbor. The best word for me to describe their cocktails is \"balanced.\" You will not find one overly sugary drink on the menu (unlike many other tiki bars). My favorite cocktail is the Tropic Thunder. Not only are the drinks delicious, but they're decorated beautifully. Where else can you get a cocktail served to you in a barrel topped with flowers or in a glimmering golden fish mug?  The food at Hidden Harbor is also notable. Their grilled pineapple tacos are to die for, as well as the pulled pork buns. Finally, they have a happy hour, which only makes them more appealing - their happy hour daiquiris are phenomenal! I cannot recommend Hidden Harbor enough. An absolute must-try in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always have a great time! My favorite drink by far is the Josie's Faraway Vacation, and I especially like the plastic shark they include in your drink. The bar itself has a really nice vibe and makes you feel like you're on a tropical island vacation, even in the middle of winter. The staff is very attentive and friendly, and while the drinks are a bit pricey you can definitely tell that they put a lot of work into each one. They're constantly changing up their food menu and although it isn't huge, everything that I've tried has been delicious. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Hidden Harbor not only makes me want to go to the Islands, but it also gets me to Squirrel Hill. While I don't mind SH at all, I never really made the trek over there. Everything changed when Hidden Harbor opened. Maybe it was the fun tropical feel, or the incredibly friendly staff, but let's get down to it... the cocktails keep me coming back!   I will preface this by saying I'm not a super sweet drink fan. If a drink is sweet, it must have the perfect amount of booze and mixers to make a well balanced cocktail. Most times it's syrupy sweet grossness. You will not get that here. What you will get is a well crafted, thoughtful drink that combines the perfect balance of taste and flair.   And talk about flair, every single drink comes with some sort of accoutrement, including of course, an umbrella, edible flowers and awesome stirrers you can take home. I currently have about 5 shark stirrers in my home collection now. So you can tell how much I've come here!   My fave drink is the Tropic Thunder, which is a five rum concoction that is not for the light hearted. You can also get group drinks that serve 2-4 people if you're good at sharing! I also enjoy the classic Zombie. All drinks come in some fun glass or fish container (seriously).   I challenge you to go here and not have a good time!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times. The first time I had dinner here, which I would not recommend, and the second time I sat at the bar, which I would definitely recommend!  It's a lot of fun to watch the bartenders make these very elaborate drinks. We saw the bartender make one in this beautiful fish glass. We kept looking through the menu trying to figure out what drink it was. Eventually the bartender overheard our conversation and told us it's called \"Tokoyo Drift\", and it's not on the menu anymore, but offered to make one for us anyway! It was awesome, complete with little pop boba as \"caviar\"  I can't give this place 5 stars because I did not particularly like the food here, and I feel like most of the drinks are either very strong or very sweet, and I wish they had some lighter/clean options (think rum and coke v. gin and tonic). If you like tiki-bar style drinks then you'll love this place. It's just not really my kind of drink. I also find it frustrating that they are closed Sundays and mondays"}
{"text":"The drinks were perfect. I have always been a fan of tiki bars, not sure why but a well done tropical drink is hard to find, even in the tropics. Nailed the one and i can say, I'll be back for more. Kudos.  Truly well done!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a zero but 1 star is the lowest possible rating. I went for a second time because I wanted so bad for this place to be good latin restaurant, but all I got was even more disappointed. I ordered drinks from the bar and they where good, very pretty but very over priced. Then I ordered the octopus salad. Now I'm Puerto Rican and when I see octopus salad on the the menu of a Puerto Rican restaurant I am thinking that this salad would of had a lot of Latin Flavor. While the octopus was tender, the flavor was underwhelming. And my friend ordered the seviche with plantain chips. The seviche lacked everything that makes a seviche so wonderful. It had no spice no heat and was incredibly mediocre, plus the plantain chips where burnt. When our bartender  asked how our food was and we said not very good he literally replied with an \"okay\". It's very disappointing that's a Puerto Rican/Hawaiian restaurant has let me down twice, and to make matters worse the staff obviously is so arrogant because of the current hype that they don't care to make things right. They could least care that your customer is not happy with the meal and take that into consideration l. Definitely not going again!"}
{"text":"Hidden Harbor for the win! What a gem. We were in town for a wedding and made reservations for the following Saturday with the newly married couple. It was perfect, the running joke was that they were on their honeymoon. It's so beautifully decorated, you almost forget you're in Pittsburgh and not on some island enjoying tiki drinks living the good life.    We ordered the jerk chicken tacos, jerk chicken nachos, fish tacos, and a tuna pokè bowl.  All of the ingredients were fresh and tasty.  We especially enjoyed the nachos.  The frozen drinks and craft cocktails were amazing too.  They carry over 200 types of rum, which was really cool.  I had never been to a rum bar before that. They offer rum flights if you're not sure what you like.    I can't praise the waitstaff, cooks, and hosts enough.  They were very accommodating. At first we requested a booth but realized the tables hit below our knees, then we asked if we could move to a high top.  They were very nice about it.  I just didn't want to eat my nachos and poke bowl awkwardly like that.  Those booths are perfect for having drinks.   You can tell they put a lot of thought into all aspects of the business.  Loved it and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This place is so unique and has become one of my top recommendations when people ask for a good cocktail. They did an excellent job with the decor and presentation of the tiki vibe. It's not over the top or corny, but rather it's very authentic and a refreshing place to go to experience something a little different in the city.   Their cocktails are on the pricey end, but they are well worth it. They are so well crafted and beautifully presented, (and not to mention super strong). Their food is also delicious. They have a small menu of some shareable things which include tacos, chicken and bacon meatballs, and pork buns. All of which i tried and were very good.   And last but not least, their staff is so pleasant! Can't wait to go back, yet again."}
{"text":"Great drinks and friendly service! Loved the shark drink. We sat outside which was lovely and we still got good service."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening because I love a good tiki bar.  The decor was great and the drink menu even better.  The pricing was pretty standard and the selection abundant.  They have something for everyone taste.  We got the Crab Rangoon nachos and wow were they good!  I'll be back for happy hour next time!"}
{"text":"Drinks are great and the inside has a really cool tiki/beach vibe. Food menu is a bit limited. However, we both had pokes, and they were delicious. Tacos we saw others eating looked really good."}
