{"text":"Their breakfast quesadilla is the perfect Saturday. So fresh with vegetables and great guac but still bringing the eggs and cheese I crave. Can't wait to come back and try the whole menu!"}
{"text":"One of the too many Mexican restaurant on the Dame...

Nice place, kind service but nothing that stands out.

Price wise, ain't cheap : plain old, spiced up Mexican style sandwich for 11.00$ with no sides and a shooter glass size of flavoured water 3.50$ (was good but I was out in two sips).

Best of luck to them.

Hasta luego"}
{"text":"Very cute new Mexican restaurant, great decor with a bar wrapping around the storefront windows. A small, simple menu- just the way I like menus. A jar of spicy pickled vegetables sits at every table and although it's table service, it's got a take-out counter vibe. I tried the flautas- crunchy corn flour tortillas, stuffed with all sorts of goodness and a generous heap of feta to top it off. The jalapeño definitely stands out in the sauce, so it's not for those with a sensitive palate! I've been craving these for a long time. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Lupita is fantastic, delicious authentic tortas, reasonably priced, friendly service, and a beautiful space with big windows and view on the park. The rotating soup-du-jour is a perfect addition. Great for families too."}
{"text":"OMG that sandwich was so good! Honestly i can't remember the last time I had such a great sandwich. 

We stopped in here for a mid-day snack without any particular expectations, other than to quell the rumbling in our stomachs. I ordered the Malinche - végé and my wife had the Flautas. The Flautas were very good, crunchy and tasty and all that but the Malinche sandwich, wozers. It was great!

Every aspect of the sandwich fro the bread to the cheese and even the lettuce was terrific. Normally I wait until I've been to a place a couple of times before giving a 5 star review, but this sandwich was 5 stars all on its own. 

Additionally, the resto is super quaint and family run. Exactly the type of local spot that you want to support. The family has tried to recreate the feeling from Mexican markets and introduce Montrealers to Mexican fare beyond the taco and burrito and I think that they are really on to something.  I'm sure that you'll enjoy a stop at Lupita."}
{"text":"In the heart of Saint Henri, on Notre-Dame street, bunch of restaurants on the same block, and side by side. Here is Lupita, a simple and adorable Mexican \"diner\", Run by mother and two daughters. Few chairs by the window, and four big picnic tables. It was mildly colorful compared to any other Mexican restaurants, where multi colors are flaunting in your face.

Enthusiastic service by our server. Simple menus, Tortas, and some extra dishes too. My sister got Tortas Al Pastor (grilled chicken, grilled pineapples...and more). She loved her sandwich to the T. It was enormous that she had difficulty to finish it completely. I ordered the drink, perro salado (tequila based) and vegetarian flautas. My drink was mind blowing. My flautas was good, but it could have been better; slight zing was missing. Then we asked for churros on the menu, but they only serve churros on the weekend. That was saddening.

Initially, it wasn't busy, later on more customers came in, so the music became louder. It killed the vibe. Second server who took over, was little abrasive, so it was disappointing."}
{"text":"Chilanga and Huevos sandwiches are out of this world. Breakfast here is the best. Huevos sandwich - fresh ciabatta roll with lots of chorizo and amazing aioli sauce. Fresh, savory and flavor-loaded. Relaxed atmosphere and good service. Chilanga sandwich with chicken: chicken tastes like it was just fried. Tender and crispy at the same time and with soft ciabatta roll the texture of the chicken is highlighted."}

{"text":"One word; disappointing.  
There are better mexican restaurants in the neighborhood with a more cozy ambiance."}
{"text":"Terrible value for price. Bland sandwiches.  Like almost everything in st Henri, top dollar for mediocrity"}
{"text":"Don't want to be harsh to these compas but I agree with one of the previous reviews: nice and clean and decent sandwich but with a low value price ratio."}
{"text":"The sandwiches r so good!!! I had the cochinita tortas which was basically pulled pork with coleslaw in a sandwich . OMG it was ridiculously good!! It exceeded my expectations. I will go back when they get their liquor license and try the chicken torta. They have a jar of pickled chili on each table so I put some in the sandwich n it made it even better. It was spicy but not overpowering. Be warned the tortas don't come with anything  but honestly I was quite full after."}
{"text":"The service was great. They really accommodated my 6 year old daughter. The food was excellent as well. We'll be back"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in town!! Service is amazing and made me feel like home! I got burro salado and the best brunch ever. The coffee is great too! This is the second time in Montreal and I can say the best customer service."}
{"text":"4 etoiles surtout pour le decor , simple et joliment coloré. La bouffe est bonne et le service attentioné. Les portions pourraient etre plus copieuses etant donné leur prix ... mais si vous n'etes pas trop ambicieux ca devrait suffire."}
