{"text":"Went for.the buy one get one lapdances. Was completely insulted by a flapjack-tittied heffer whos goodybag smelled like bleach. Halfway through my second lapdance this bag of lard busted out a fart so pungent and nauzeatung she even offered to refund my $20. Wings here are good, though. Try the mild sauce."}
{"text":"Will NEVER EVER COME BACK HERE...had a stripper say fuck u when I asked my buddy if he wanted to get a dance with her after I passed on a dance.
Had waitress tell my buddy that she wanted a tip.
Had one waitress ask us if we wanted another drink then proceeded to walk outside for a smoke.
Worst service and staff ever."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you want to have some fun, the people there are really \"fun\" and \"adventurous\". The only issue I encountered was when I ordered my food. I ordered Chicken Wings but I got Fish instead."}
{"text":"This is an okay joint that is somewhat clean. Last time I was there they had a smokers room with tvs that were close to the stage. This room us great to hit on and work deals out with the girls. I've been to far more superior clubs than this one in montreal, but this one is good for a pitcher and boobs if you live nearby."}
