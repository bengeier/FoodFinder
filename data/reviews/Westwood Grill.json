{"text":"First to review? So, I'll say right off the bat that Chinese food is not my go-to food.  I pretty much never crave it.  However, we'd passed by this place a bunch of times and we were intrigued.  This past weekend, my boyfriend had a craving for Chinese food and we tried it out.  We had some friends over and we ordered General Tso's chicken, some orange chicken thing, vegetable fried rice and some dim sum.  Though it took a while for it to get to us and it seemed like the delivery guy wanted a larger tip, the food was delicious. So delicious that I started to re-think my food preference hierarchy!"}
{"text":"Obviously this restuarant has gone thru an ownership change. Loved this restaurant for years and ordered about once a month. Recently had a charge show up for 1.40 for a delivery. Called and asked as I was a block away that I normally would tip driver. They indicated that I should I adjust my tip. I indicated that  that the delivery charge was insufficient for the driver and bordered on slavery. When driver came to door I said I would not tip and driver should check with owner. Owner called me and  told me that they would not deliver anymore.   CHECK THIS OUT AM I AM IDIOT???????"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but I feel I should warn others. I ordered fried shrimp dumplings and noticed an ant inside. I think I even ate a piece of the ant!!!  Their kitchen is likely not sanitary. I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"The  garlic Chinese broccoli has too much garlic and it tate like pre-minced garlic from from a jar.  The salt and pepper shrimp is covered in chilli flakes and the shrimp is overcooked.   Pad Thai was good."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Chinese food place. It's on the more pricey side. I always order the General Tso chicken and the Cantonese chow mien.  They are usually very quick and everything is always very tasty."}
{"text":"So my son often requests Chinese delivery.  The sad thing is, there's nothing Chinese about the food he wants.  Doughy, tasteless chicken balls and the like...bla! Well we tried Westwood Grill tonight because some of the reviews said the fare was much better than the usual.  Well, wow, it was so very good.  Mu Shu pork was flavourful with crispy veggies and delightful pancake.  The pork to veggie ratio was a little low, but it was so good I can't really complain.  My son's alternative choice for chicken balls was a scrumptionus Chicken Soo Guy.  It was delicious.  Whole breast of chicken in a lighter than usual batter.  The pre-requisite pink goo sweet and sour wasn't too sweet.  The veggie spring rolls were tasty and not too greasy.  The chicken fried rice was a bit blah, but definitely better than we're used to.  Delivery was quick and friendly.  We will be calling them again."}
{"text":"Got an item wrong on my order refused to make it right.  Food is terrible, so it probably didn't matter."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the High Park area, and was looking through the very limited delivery options in this area... when I stumbled upon Westwood Grill and was surprised to learn it was a chinese/asian food restaurant. We ordered the General Tao chicken, sweet and sour pork, steamed rice and mixed vegetables. The food was very tasty and delicious, and we will definitely order from here again. Our only complaint is that the portions are much smaller than the other Chinatown locations we've ordered from before... a tad disappointing, but likely there's a demand in this area that won't have them going out of business anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ordered food a couple of weeks ago. I was very disappointed with the quality of food. Pad thai was bright orange, spring rolls were awful-- basically we threw out our left overs and barely ate our meal.  Never again. So disappointed as I was hoping for a great Thai/Asian place in our community. Hopefully they will read their reviews and re examine their food.  I wish I heeded the advice from others on this one."}
{"text":"ordered here a few times in 2014. The food itself is above average, the prices are way too high for the take out portion size. $70 taxes in for 5 dishes that amounted to 2 dishes full of food and some left over noodles?   Come on now Westwood Grill - strike 3, your out"}
{"text":"Ordered the BBQ duck hoping for $16 it would at least be decent having read good reviews.  It was reheated in the oven clearly from somewhere else.  It was greasy and disgusting.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Dined in yesterday, and was quite impressed with the quality. Too often the vegetables in a dish are just throwins but all or our dishes came with fresh produce that was well prepared. My partner had a mixed veg-tofu dish that was wonderful (again, good veg meal options are often hard to come by) and I had the spicy garlic shrimp, which was as advertised: spicy, garlicky and the shrimp was prepared well and the whole dish was great. Yes, a little pricier than other places, but I'm a big believer in \"you get what you pay for\" and in this case it pays off. The portions were perfect, too.  I don't live in the area but will defintely add them to my list of delivery options next time."}
{"text":"For a while, I thought that the reason Westwood Grill food tasted heavy and gross was because I kept ordering it when I was hungover. Turns out, even when I'm healthy, I just don't like it. The meat seems poor quality, the sauces are heavy and unappetizing, often the vegetables are way overcooked - hell, they don't even seem to do noodles well. Usually leftover Chinese food is one of my faves, but leftover Westwood Grill food just sits in my fridge being avoided, even when I'm in dire straits of hunger.   It's possible I need someone who knows the menu well to point out what to try and what to avoid, but everything I've picked on my own has been pretty unappealing. For the past few months, I've made an effort to eat anywhere but here, no matter how hungover I am.  If you want some traditional Canadian-style kinda greasy Chinese (yeah, that's my tradition, gotta be honest) and you live in Bloor West, I would definitely order from Moon Doo before here."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's usually quite but has a brisk take out business. All I can say is \"crispy beef\". Not getting this dish is a mistake....  The mixed reviews confuse me. This is really a very good place. Always piping hot, flavourful, and the people that work there are great."}
{"text":"Over all a 3.  General Tao anything here gets a 4.  This place can really be good, but I think it depends on who is in the kitchen that day, which sucks because it's not the cheapest Chinese delivery.  I'd definitely take a chance on this place when I feel like ordering, still the best Chinese delivery around my area."}
{"text":"These guys are ridiculous. I'm on a job site and didn't want to leave my tools so I decided to do delivery. I ordered 2 dishes and a large soup. When it arrived it came with 2 chopsticks (good thing I'm Chinese) and nothing else for utensils. As good as I am with chopsticks.... It's just about impossible to drink soup with chopsticks. So I called back asking them to bring me a spoon and they refused!!!! This is certainly not a cheap place. I can order other lunch menu specials for about 1/3 or more of the price less than what these guys charge. All I can say is that these guys left a really bad taste in my mouth and I will ABSOLUTELY NEVER order from this place again. Their service is terrible and don't give a crap about their clients. Terrible....very overpriced."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Their Hot and Sour soup is wonderful. Portion sizes are good. Decor and ambience are good. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! I ordered their Orange Chicken and their Scheswean Chicken. When I received them BOTH were Orange chicken. The manager, \"Mike\" told me it was only because both are very similar and therefore look the same. I know this is untrue because Scheswean recipes have peppers in them. Plus the food was really bland. Save your money and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm honestly shocked with the low rating . This is the best Chinese food in the city hands down !!!"}
{"text":"The food is great. Not too much oil, and you still feel full after an hour. Almost makes you feel like you're eating \"healthy\" chinese food. The price isn't bad, and they don't have your typical Canadian chinese food. They have more authentic, and with a 6pg menu, everyone will find something they like.   Fav - Beef with noodle           Chicken with broccoli           Wonton Soup"}
{"text":"My favourite Chinese takeout. Since moving to the neighbourhood in 2008, I've been ordering from Westwood Grill about once monthly. The menu is quite vast, haven't tried everything yet but definitely have some favourites: BBQ duck Dim sum Spicy crispy beef tenderloin Cantonese chow mein  The portion sizes are decent and meat dishes always have a lot of, well, meat in them :)  The best part of ordering with Westwood? Online ordering on their website. Quick and painless."}
{"text":"For a former Annex-dweller, being merely a hop and a skip from Chinatown you tend to take it for granted, you can always go to Taste of China and dine quite well with quality. Moving to the Junction I remembered this isn't the case in all neighbourhoods. At the Westwood Grill I realized that many restaurants outside the core are often the North American-Chinese food hybrids, with a few authentic menu items peppered with the 'traps' of orange chicken and the like. At the Westwood there are quite a few to avoid but you can manage to eat well at the same time.  The Mu Shu bbq pork with peking style pancakes was a pretty good bet. The pork was deliciously fried (not very healthy I wager) and it was pretty dry, considering half the other meat items were coated and covered in sauce. The General Tao's chicken on the other hand, was pretty standard. A bit boring.   I'll go again and probably get the exact same thing, but they also, they have a Dim Sum menu that looks pretty great, I didn't try it this time but will give it a shot in the future. All in all, decent place, nice service but I'm not too sure about how often I'd go."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food, everything we've ordered has been really tasty. The crispy beef is a favourite. Like the dim sum options too. Only problem with this place is that they're a little pricey. Restaurant is usually pretty empty but I think that's because they do the majority of their business through take-out and delivery. It's one of our regular neighbourhood spots."}
{"text":"Westwood Grill is my go-to chinese take-out spot. Food arrives fast and hot. Especially good: their dumplings and mu shu. I always judge a chinese food resto by their General Tao chicken, and Westwood's doesn't disappoint. Portions are big and there are always lots of leftovers. I haven't tried any of their Thai-based stuff, but there's a good selection of curries too."}
{"text":"Killer lemon chicken (literally). Both my wife and I felt horrible after having dinner here. We have been regulars until now. Too bad, is the closest chinese resto to our place. Noodles and dim sum were ok, but stay away from fried dishes."}
{"text":"I love this place and it is about the only reason I miss living in BWV. The food is extremely fresh and service is friendly and quick. General Tao's is our favourite dish but I love the option of also getting dim sum items.  The restaurant is impeccably clean and the food is nicely presented in very large portions, the lunch specials are massive. It is really our go to place before heading downtown for Chinese.  Fine place!"}
{"text":"Good food but I agree with the other reviews.  Ordered here a few times over the years and every time I ask how Chinese  food like this could be that expensive.  Small portions and overpriced."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai/ Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood. Food is always great and delivery is fast. Love the ginger chicken, spicy beef broccoli  and anything with shrimp is cooked to perfection!  Mmmmm tasty"}
{"text":"There seems to be a lack of delivered foods in our area so I was keen to try Westwood Grill.  I love their online ordering, especially the option where you can pick your order delivery time (i.e. I ordered at 3pm but wanted 6pm delivery).  I paid online with my credit card which was handy but at the same time, a bit uncomfortable for me because I don't like using my credit card online unless it's a large company that I know.   The food showed up at exactly 6pm as requested which was amazing.  However, the driver asked for cash. I said I paid online with my credit card and he said \"no, it says cash on your bill\".  Hmm.  This caused me a bit more discomfort.  Felt a bit fishy.  Was this a scam to see if I would pay twice?  He offered to call his manager to confirm.  I offered him my house phone to call right there but he went back to his car and returned within a minute and said it was okay, that I did pay by credit card.  Hopefully it was just an error.  The food was excellent, even though, yes, I found it a bit pricey.  We got the Chow Mein, a couple of meats and fried rice.  Overall I would recommend."}
{"text":"I was happy to see this restaurant had a few solid veggie options so I ordered \"Buddha Veggie\" meal (forgot the exact title) and it was very good, the kids liked their food as well, the service was fast and courteous."}
{"text":"I moved to Toronto in July 2014 and my boyfriend and I desperately searched for a good Chinese delivery spot because it is one of our favourite meals for lazy nights at home. We tried and bunch and this is now our favourite! the menu is enormous so I can only vouch for our regular go-tos, which include: hot and sour soup, general tsao chicken, sweet and sour chicken with pineapple, garlic baby Bok Choy, baby Chinese broccoli, pan fried egg noodle in soya sauce with veggies, and pepper salt tofu. YUM!!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Despite mixed reviews on Yelp, we were very happy and impressed with our takeout experience from Westwood grill!  The food was exceptionally good (compared with other Chinese takeout places we've had in the area). The delivery was timely and the service friendly.  We had Chin Jew Shrimp, Manchurian Chicken, hot & sour soup, and bah choy gah (spinach and shrimp dumplings).  Everything was very good. The Chin Jew Shrimp is AMAZING! Perfectly cooked with a tangy spicy/sweet savory sauce. We didn't know what to expect but were blown away by this delicious dish! Please try it!!  The Dim Sum dumplings were the second best item, also perfectly steamed, plump and flavorful (great with hoison sauce dip)  The Manchurian chicken was good, not exceptional flavorful, but well cooked with fresh vegetables. We asked for it spicy, but it was not so spicy which is probably better for some people!"}
{"text":"General Tao's chicken. When it's good it is very very good, but when it is bad it is horrid.   I'm always so disappointed when I order it and I get a congealed mess of overbattered fried chicken in red sweet and sour sauce. I sadly cross the offending restaurant off my list and it's on to the next, ever in search of good General Tao's chicken.   The Westwood delivers. I just inhaled an entire order of what appears to be one of their most popular dishes and for good reason. The chicken is perfectly cooked, not too batter-y, and there are lots of whole red chili peppers and caramelized bits of goodness in a small amount of dark red, slightly spicy sauce. It's also got fresh green onions and green peppers.   I'm so glad to have found my favourite dish, excellently prepared, so close to home.   (My daughter says the mushroom fried rice is good too.)"}
{"text":"Likely one of the best in the west end but in the pricier side.  No complaints, have not had anything that was not delicious!  Recently ordered the BBQ pork buns and salt and peppered shrimp (with chillies as requested) and it hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Pretty terrible experience here. Our order took an hour and a half to get to us. I reasoned that it was likely the kitchen was just backed up on a Friday night and when I called I was just told it would be there soon. When it did arrive, the driver mumbled something about the traffic and when we unpacked it it was soggy and ice cold.   I can see how it would be tasty fresh, but for the prices they charge it was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is the worst! I grew up in Scarborough, so good Chinese wasn't hard to come by. After ordering from this place for years, I got an order of chicken wings that  had chicken feathers sticking out of almost every wing! When i called to complain, the woman on the other end didn't even offer an apology.  Fast-forward a year later, and I decide to give this place another try. Unfortunately, when i called to place the order, I was notified that i was blacklisted for complaining. I hope these people get whats coming to them."}
